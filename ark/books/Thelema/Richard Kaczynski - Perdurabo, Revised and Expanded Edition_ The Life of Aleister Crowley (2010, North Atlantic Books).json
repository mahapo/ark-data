It isan effective combination of erudition and accessibility that will remain thestandard biography of Crowley for years to come.”—Henrik Bogdan, PhD, author of Western Esotericism and Rituals of Initiation“This is not only the most carefully researched, detailed, and informativebiography of Crowley yet written but also a remarkable insight into the natureof magic itself.”—Ronald Hutton, author of The Triumph of the Moon and Blood and Mistletoe: TheHistory of the Druids in Britain“If you’re a collector of Crowley biographies, this is an essential addition toyour collection. If you can only afford one Crowley biography, this is the oneto get.”—Sabazius, X°, National Grand Master, Ordo Templi Orientis, USA“The blurb on the front of the dust jacket [of the new edition] says: Thedefinitive biography of the founder of modern magick. Having read the firstedition of Perdurabo, and every other biography of this controversial figure, Ireadily agree.”—Oz Fritz, music producer and engineer“This new edition is essential reading for anyone wanting to understand theGreat Beast.”—Clive Harper, author of Notes towards a Bibliography of Austin Osman Spare“Richard Kaczynski’s Perdurabo: The Life of Aleister Crowley is a meticulouslyresearched biography of a person whose reputation has been distorted by rumorsand misinformation. Crowley will probably remain a controversial figure formany, but the readers of Perdurabo will be in a position to assess his life andwork based on evidence, and Kaczynski should be congratulated for providing itin abundance.”—Gordan Djurdjevic, sessional lecturer, Simon Fraser University“Perdurabo is the result of many years of painstaking research. Dr. Kaczynskihas been able to uncover a host of previously unexplored sources that cast newlight on Aleister Crowley’s life and works.

But their offerings now stand like skeletal framesof unfinished houses next to Kaczynski’s magnificently constructed edifice.Every brick is set in place with the mortar of meticulous research and insight.Thank you, Dr. Kaczynski. I’ve waited thirty-five years for this.”—Lon Milo DuQuette, author of The Magick of Aleister Crowley“At long last, the world has a balanced and readable biography that reflects howmagick shaped every facet of Aleister Crowley’s life. And Dr. Kaczynski doesn’tdismiss magick as humbug or mumbo-jumbo but validates it as a legitimate methodof spiritual development meriting serious study.”—Christopher S. Hyatt, PhD, author of Undoing Yourself“Dr. Kaczynski brings two unique qualifications to this massive biography of theprophet and master of magick Aleister Crowley: he is both a university professorwho moves comfortably in research institutions (and the masses of data containedtherein) and a practicing adept of [Crowley’s] Thelemic magical system. This isa magnificent book and is highly recommended.”—James Wasserman, author of The Militia of Heaven and Art and Symbols of theOccult.“Richard Kaczynski uses a novelist’s touch to make this exceptionallywell-researched book read like an adventure story.

BBC Two’s 2002 poll for the 100Greatest Britons ranked Crowley at seventy-three, just ahead of Robert theBruce; since then, his portrait has been added to London’s National PortraitGallery. When Rolling Stone asked Paul McCartney what accounts for the Beatles’enduring popularity, he answered:I think it’s basically magic. There is such as thing as magic, and the Beatleswere magic.It depends on what you believe life is. Life is an energy field, a bunch ofmolecules. And these particular molecules formed to make these four guys, whothen formed into this band called the Beatles and did all that work. I have tothink that was something metaphysical.

Meanwhile, Martin Hayes and Roy HutesonStewart’s graphic novel Crowley: Wandering the Waste will be released in late2010. And on television, the first balanced documentary on him, AleisterCrowley: The Beast 666, aired in Canada in 2007 and the United States in 2009.3[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#ack-nts003]The result of all this exposure is that Crowley’s works are in high demand,landing him on the American Book Exchange’s list of the top ten best-sellingauthors.4 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#ack-nts004] His desirable firsteditions were also the subject of a 2008 article in Book and Magazine Collectorand the 2009 coffee-table book The Wickedest Books in the World.5[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#ack-nts005] Similar interest in his artworkis attested by two 2008 exhibitions: at the Palais de Tokyo from May 29 to June29, and at the Pompidou Center from June 5 to June 29.In academia, where magic has become an accepted area of religious studies,Crowley was the subject of several papers in the first decade of thetwenty-first century,6 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#ack-nts006] and ananthology of new academic papers on Aleister Crowley has been prepared under theeditorship of Henrik Bogdan and Martin P. Starr. On April 16, 2008, the firstacademic panel devoted entirely to Aleister Crowley was held at the conference“Twenty Years and More: Research into Minority Religions, New ReligiousMovements and ‘the New Spirituality.’ ” Outside of religious studies, Crowleyhas also turned up in studies of politics,7[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#ack-nts007] science,8[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#ack-nts008] and drug culture.9[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#ack-nts009] These subjects—including currentperspectives on his careers in mountain climbing and theater—are reflected inthis revised and expanded edition of Perdurabo, along with a great deal of neworiginal research.This new edition would not have been possible without the kind assistance ofmany people.

He counted two … three … fourvoices at least, followed by silence: a heavy stillness filled only by hisbreath. Aleister Crowley feared for his life.London’s Euston Road was far from the safe, nurturing campus of Trinity College;farther from his Redhill, Surrey, home; and farther still from the Swiss Alps,where training on the Schönbühl Glacier resulted in his fateful meeting with theman who sent him into this ordeal. For Crowley, the chain of events leading tothis situation was every bit as real and confining as the rope now wound abouthis waist. The sensation of the tightening restraints stilled the images of hislife and snapped him to the present. When tumblers fell and hinges creaked,excitement replaced his fear. It began.“Child of Earth,” commanded the man beside him, “arise and enter the Path ofDarkness.”Blindfolded and bound, Crowley staggered awkwardly to his feet, advancing but astep before the sensation of a sharp rap striking the floor in front of his feetfroze him in place. A voice from the doorway replied, “Very Honored Hierophant,is it your pleasure that the candidate be admitted?”“It is,” the Hierophant intoned solemnly from the room beyond. “FratresStolistes and Dadouchos, assist the Kerux in the admission.”The one blocking the doorway, evidently the Kerux, addressed Crowley in a loudclear voice. “Child of Earth, unpurified and unconsecrated, thou canst not enterour Sacred Hall.”A wet finger reached under the hoodwink and traced a cross on his forehead as anew voice declared, “Child of Earth, I consecrate thee with water.” Next, smokyincense, sweet and thick, wafted over his masked face. “Child of Earth,” anotherannounced, “I purify thee with fire.” Once the officers Stolistes and Dadouchosfinished these appointed tasks, an unknown hand pulled him forward and led himstumbling blindly through the room. Finally, he heard the voice of theHierophant entreat him with grave authority. “Child of Earth, why dost thourequest admission to this Order?”Prompted by his guide, Crowley stammered, “My soul is wandering in darkness,seeking for the light of occult knowledge.”“Thou wilt kneel on both knees. Give me your right hand, which I place on thissacred and sublime symbol.” The Child of Earth heard several others step closeas the Hierophant guided his hand onto a wooden triangle on the table beforehim. “Place thy left hand in mine, bow thy head, repeat thy full name at length,and say after me.”He swallowed dryly as the achievements of his short life—from publishing hisfirst book of poetry to setting records for sea cliff and mountainclimbing—paled in comparison to the weight of this moment. Crowley parted hislips and spoke. “I, Aleister Crowley, in the presence of the Lord of theUniverse and of this Hall of Neophytes of the Order of the Golden Dawn in theOuter, do of my own free will and accord hereby and hereon most solemnly pledgemyself to keep secret this Order, its name, the name of its members, and theproceedings which take place at its meetings, from all and every person in thewhole world who is outside the pale of the Order. I furthermore promise andswear that I will divulge nothing whatsoever concerning this Order to theoutside world, in case either of my resignation, demission, or expulsiontherefrom, after the completion of my admission.“I will not suffer myself to be hypnotized, or mesmerized, nor will I placemyself in such a passive state that any uninitiated person, power, or being maycause me to lose control of my thoughts, words, or actions. Neither will I usemy occult powers for any evil purposes. These points I generally and severally,upon this sacred and sublime symbol, swear to observe without evasion,equivocation, or mental reservation of any kind whatsoever; under the no lesspenalty on the violation of any or either of them of being expelled from thisOrder, as a wilfully perjured wretch, void of all moral worth, and unfit for thesociety of all right and true persons.”Parched, he whispered the oath’s solemn and stunning conclusion. “And inaddition, under the awful penalty of voluntarily submitting myself to a deadlyand hostile current of will set in motion by the chiefs of the Order, by which Ishould fall slain and paralyzed without visible weapon.” A sharpened steel bladepressed against the nape of his neck as he spoke these words, then withdrew justas suddenly. “So help me the Lord of the Universe and my own higher soul.”The Hierophant commanded, “Let the candidate rise.” He did. “Child of Earth,long hast thou dwelt in darkness. Quit the night and seek the day.”Someone whisked the hoodwink from his head, and amid the images that burst ontohis vision, he saw the scarlet-robed Hierophant. He was in his mid-forties, butclad in mystic robes and insignia, he might as well have been immortal. He fixedthe young man with his eye, raised his staff above the candidate’s head, andproclaimed, “Frater Perdurabo, we receive thee into the Order of the GoldenDawn.” Perdurabo was the Latin motto Crowley had chosen to describe hisspiritual aspirations in the order. It was Latin for “I shall endure to theend,” from Mark 13:13: “but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall besaved.”Standing in this temple of the Order of the Golden Dawn, beaming with relief andjoy, he knew he had discovered the Secret Sanctuary. On Friday, November 18,1898, Aleister Crowley—mountaineer, poet, and Seeker of the Light—was reborn asFrater Perdurabo.1 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts001]Four generations before Aleister Crowley was born, his great-great-grandfatherThomas Crowley (c. 1713–1787) rebelled against his parents’ religion,self-published his tracts and poetry, and sought to avert the AmericanRevolution by pitching his political schemes to Benjamin Franklin. Thomas was ageneral merchant who lived in London with his wife and seven children at 73Gracechurch Street, with a country estate in Walworth. As a “religiouscontroversialist and political writer,”2[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts002] Thomas Crowley penned overthirty books, booklets, and broadsheets, many criticizing his Quaker faith andits opposition to tithes and taxes. Works like Dissertations on the PecuniaryTestimonies of the People Called Quakers, Relative Their Refusing to Pay Tithesand Church-Rates, as also Fines or Assessments Respecting the Militia orMilitary Service (c. 1773) and To the Superstitious Priests, Lovers of Their OwnPower, and to Their Silly Tools of Priestcraft, Quacks and Money-mongers, amongthe Misled People Called Quakers (no date) did not endear him to churchleadership. Indeed, Smith’s bibliography of Quaker-authored works disclaimedthat “Few (if any) of the publications of this Friend were approved of, butrather disapproved of and testified against;”3[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts003] in February of 1774, ThomasCrowley was disowned by the Devonshire House monthly meeting.4[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts004] That same month, his daughterAnn (1757–1774) died short of her seventeenth birthday after a prolongedillness; inspired by her pious sickbed statements, Thomas published these asSome Expressions of Ann Crowley.5[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts005] He blazed his own religiouspath, although “regretting that his unorthodox tendencies made life difficultfor his family, who maintained their Quaker association.”6[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts006]Many of his political writings, appearing under the nom de plume “Amor Patriæ”(Latin, “a lover of his country”),7[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts007] addressed the taxation withoutrepresentation disputes between the crown and the American colonies. Despitedisparaging the colonists’ protests as shortsighted, he agreed in principle withtheir objections, and urged giving parliamentary seats to colonialrepresentatives lest war result. He advocated this message through works likeObservations and Propositions for an Accommodation between Great Britain and HerColonies (1768) and Dissertations, on the Grand Dispute between Great-Britainand America (1774). He also corresponded with Benjamin Franklin in an effort tomediate the escalating political tensions.8[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts008] Franklin ultimately dismissedhim as hopelessly obsessed, even though his concerns about war proved prescient.After the Revolutionary War, Crowley’s political writing ceased.Thomas Crowley died a widower at Walworth on December 17, 1787, leaving hischildren an estate in land, buildings, stocks, and cash valued at severalthousand pounds.9 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts009]Although his son Thomas has been described as “a successful business man,”10[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts010] Aleister’s great-grandfatherThomas Crowley (1753–1809) first appears in London’s business directories in1777 in the decidedly unpleasant and hazardous trade of currier, tanner, andleatherworker at 35 Camomile Street. Eleven years later, in 1788, he becamebankrupt; 1790 was his last appearance in the directories.11[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts011] From these humble beginnings,four of Thomas Crowley’s eight children would establish the family fortune thatwould be such a formative influence on Aleister Crowley’s life.12[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts012]Three of his sons—Abraham (1795–1864), Charles Sedgefield (c. 1798–1868), andHenry (1793–1857)13 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts013]—followedvery similar paths. Like their father, and his father before him, they supportedthe abolition of slavery.14 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts014] Allthree married into the Curtis family of Alton: Abraham married Charlotte Curtis(1801–1892) in 1822; Charles took her younger sister Emma (1804–1845) as hissecond wife in 1838; and Henry married their sister Elizabeth (1806–1900) in1845.15 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts015] Together these brothersformed a business partnership to purchase, on August 28, 1821, the Brewhouse inTurk Street, Alton; it had been founded in 1763 by James B. Baverstock(1741–1815), who pioneered the use of scientific instrumentation in brewing (hewas the first person to use a hydrometer) and laid the foundation forsaccharometry (measuring the amount of sugar in a solution).16[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts016] The Crowley family’s Quakerfaith opposed the production and consumption of hard spirits and intemperancethrough any kind of liquor, but there were no prohibitions against brewing, andat least a dozen Quakers in the eighteenth century were prominently involved inthe industry.17 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts017] Indeed, Greynotes that the family already owned a brewery at Waddon, near Croydon, Surrey,which had been in operation for two hundred years.18[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts018]Under the name A. C. S. & H. Crowley, the new brewery established itself inCroydon and Alton and boomed with the opening of its Alton ale houses. Byoffering a glass of ale and a sandwich (ham was a specialty) for four pence, theCrowleys not only competed with the four-penny ale offered by brewers like Mannof Mile End Road,19 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts019] but in doingso they also essentially invented the pub lunch. Their shops were “for the mostpart open-fronted with a clean marble counter with four or five handsome brassengines; small plates and glasses were provided with a display of bread,biscuits, cakes, etc.”20 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts020]No less than Charles Dickens noted the growing popularity of Crowley’s alehouses, writing that Alton’s growth boom included “a feeding place, ‘establishedto supply the Railway public with a first-rate sandwich and a sparkling glass ofCrowley’s Ale.’ ”21 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts021] Similarly,the 1863 article “Tales out of School” recounts a sixteen-year-old’s first visitto the shop:The libation was obtained at a little shop hard by, where ‘Alton Ale’ wasadvertised in large black letters on a ground of white canvas, with a furtherannouncement that you might have a glass of ale and a sandwich for four-pence.It arrived in two bright pewter pots with spouts, and was accompanied with threetall and narrow glasses, three to a pint, which would give four glasses of aleto each of us.22 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts022]Yates’s Recollections and Experiences recounted lunching at Crowley’s Alton alehouse, whose shops were “exceedingly popular with young men who did notparticularly care about hanging round the bars or taverns.”23[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts023] Crowley’s pub lunches offeredhigh-quality food, and in time added other items like Banbury cakes. Thisprompted competitors to introduce the “Melton Mowbray Pork Pie,” and ultimatelythe luncheon counter and grill room.24[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts024]The tremendous success and spread of the Alton ale houses also inspiredparodies, with a beer shop in City Road announcing “A Glass of Ale and anElectric Shock for Fourpence.”25 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts025]In response to their imitators, the Crowleys ran the following notice in theTimes:CROWLEYS’ ALTON ALE.—Being desirous that the public should not be deceived inpurchasing a spurious article for their Alton ale, A.C.S. and H. Crowley beg toinform them that they have no Alton ale stores or any agent in London, except attheir ALTON ALE WHARF, Upper Fore-street, Lambeth. And whereas houses have beenopened in imitation of their customers on the new “ale and sandwich plan,” theyfurther state that they do not supply ale to any such house unless the name ofCrowley is conspicuously written up.—Alton, June, 1843.26[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts026]In subsequent years, Crowley’s ale stores expanded into London locations likeBishopsgate, Kensington Park Terrace, London Bridge, Kingston, Fenchurch Street,and Wandsworth Road,27 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts027] withdistribution channels to match. Their barge Amelia carried product along theThames, while In Praise of Ale declared “the LSWR [London and South WesternRailway] transports ‘Alton Ale’ in large quantities to London.”28[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts028] Indeed, their commercial successwas so great that one city newspaper joked:Some sensation was excited in the city towards the close of the day (yesterday),in consequence of a report that government intends to legalize the sale of theBank of England, and that a celebrated purveyor of ham and beef had made thedirectors a liberal offer on behalf of an Alton ale brewer; but we think therumor is premature.29 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts029]The British census provides a fairer picture of the company’s growth: In 1851,Abraham Crowley described himself as a “brewer and maltster employing forty-sixmen.”30 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts030] A decade later, heemployed three foremen, eight maltsters, and forty-nine laborers (or sixty menin all).31 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts031]Abraham Crowley’s is the name most closely associated with the family brewingbusiness. As a young man, he apprenticed to the Quaker brewer Thomas Ashby(1762–1841) of Staines, who was married to his cousin Kitty (1760–1796).32[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts032] On December 7, 1821—four monthsafter buying the Baverstock brewery—Abraham and his brothers partnered withThomas and Charles Ashby on a ninety-nine-year counterpart lease for the BarleyMow Public House in Alton.33 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts033]Abraham’s career branched out around 1839, when he became one of the firstemigration agents employed by the newly founded New Zealand Company, whichpromoted the systematic colonization of British settlements in Wellington,Nelson, Wanganui, and Dunedin. New Zealand was a new and untested emigrationdestination at the time, but under Abraham Crowley’s agency, his hometown ofAlton had the highest rate of applications in all of England.34[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts034] As a highly successfulbusinessman, he gave back to his community by supporting both boys’ and girls’schools.35 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts035] With the acquisitionof expansive hops gardens near Alton, the family began to hold annual “hopparties,” a tradition that his widow, Charlotte, continued after his death.36[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts036][images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_001_r1.jpg]Abraham Crowley (1795–1864), founder of A.

His collections of exotic butterflies and overfour thousand bird eggs were considered the world’s finest. He was also a writeron entomology, lecturer at the Society of Arts, president of the Croydon NaturalHistory and Scientific Society, treasurer of the Royal Horticultural Society,master of the Gardeners’ Company, vice chairman of the British Ornithologists’Club, fellow of the Linnean, Zoological, and Entomological societies, and amember of the Croydon Microscopical Club.

He was Thomas Crowley’s first son, the third ofeight children. He wed Mary Sparrow (1788–1868) of West Hill, Wandsworth, inLondon on August 21, 1823,41 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts041] andtogether they had four children: Jonathan Sparrow (1826–1888), Mary Elizabeth(c. 1828–1880), Sarah Maria (1829–1856), and Aleister’s father, Edward (c.1830–1887).42 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts042]Together with his brother Charles Sedgefield Crowley, Edward Crowley Sr.diversified the family’s wealth into railways as early as 1836–1837.43[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts043] Throughout the 1840s and intothe 1850s, both brothers served as directors of many emerging railways: CharlesSedgefield Crowley directed the Direct London and Portsmouth Railway; London andSouth Western Railway; Colchester, Stour Valley, Sudbury and Halstead Railway;London and Croydon Railway; and its successor, the London, Brighton and SouthCoast Railway. Edward Crowley, meanwhile, was deputy chairman of the London andBrighton Railway, and a director of the Brighton and Chichester Railway andBrighton, Chichester and Portsmouth Railway. All three companies were part ofthe 1846 merger that formed the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, whichEdward directed along with his brother. In addition, he directed the Isle ofWight Railway and the Dublin, Belfast and Coleraine Junction Railway. He wasalso provisional director of three proposed railways: the London, Warwick,Leamington and Kidderminster Railway; the London Central Railway TerminusCompany; and the Irish North Midland Railway.44[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts044] He even held shares in the GreatWestern Railway of Canada.45 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts045] APrivate Bill Office list of 1846 railway subscribers reflects their wealth: thatyear, Edward Crowley had invested £97,408, while his brother had invested£56,850.46 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts046]Edward and Charles Sedgefield synergized the family brewing and railwayinterests. Mere days passed between Edward Crowley’s appointment to the Londonand Brighton Railway and A. C. S. & H. Crowley’s “beware of imitators” ad in theTimes.47 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts047] Writing about theBritish railway system, Henry O’Neil describes a placard with the slogan: “Inthe course of my excavations I have brought to light a board whereon is paintedin large letters these words: ESTABLISHED TO SUPPLY THE PUBLIC WITH CROWLEY’SALTON ALE.’ ”48 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts048] In 1846,Director Charles Sedgefield Crowley vocally supported the London and South WestRailway’s proposed line between Farnham and Alton, which would connect Alton toLondon. He “spoke of the great want of a line to Alton” and “considered that theprosperity of Alton depended on the obtaining this line.”49[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts049] Four years later, the debateamong the directors continued. For instance, Sergeant Gazeleeremembered the glowing picture which on a former occasion the chairman drew ofthe vast quantities of Crowley’s Alton ale which would be conveyed to London bythis proposed line, and he remembered how he trembled for the London brewerswith such a dismal prospect before them [laughter]; but he never heard of anyother traffic they were likely to get besides the Alton ale. Would they get asingle passenger more by extending the line from Farnham to Alton?50[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts050]The plan eventually passed, with a gala on Monday, July 26, 1852, as a train ranfrom London to Farnham, then continued the nine miles on to Alton for the firsttime. Thereafter, as In Praise of Ale noted, the London and South WesternRailway shipped large quantities of Alton ale to London.51[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts051]In October 1854, in his sixty-sixth year, Edward Crowley delivered an address tothe Clapham Athenæum, The Age We Live In: High Art No Evidence of a High Stateof Civilization. A reflection on the great civilizations of the past that havecrumbled, Edward Crowley cautioned that, without God, modern civilization issubject to the same fate; particularly worrisome trends included smoking,drinking, gambling, cursing, slavery, socialism, spiritualism, labor strikes,women’s rights, women’s bonnets, dancing saloons, and children referring totheir parents as “governor.”52 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts052] Alittle over a year later—on February 16. 1856—Edward Crowley died at his housein Lavender Hill, Surrey, appointing as his executors his sons Jonathan Sparrowand Edward, his son-in-law John Thrupp, and his friend Joseph Prestwick.53[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts053]When Charles Sedgefield Crowley, the last of his four brothers, died in 1868, heleft his nephews—Abraham Crowley’s four sons, Abraham, Alfred, Frederick, andPhilip, all co-owners of the family brewery and executors of his will—£48,000,his shares in the Great Western Railway, and his mines in Mexico. His remainingnieces and nephews—including Aleister’s father, Edward—divided the rest of hisestate. Charles’s cellar of over two hundred cases of wine—old sherry, port,champagne, and the like—was auctioned off on May 1, 1868.54[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts054] Shortly thereafter, Aleister’sgrandmother, Mary, succumbed to liver disease after twenty years and died on May29, 1868, at age eighty.55 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts055]Jonathan Sparrow Crowley, a civil engineer, entered the railway businessfollowing a November 1, 1852, collision on the Brighton railway managed by hisfather, Edward Crowley.56 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts056]Jonathan was at the railway’s London terminal when he learned that an expresspassenger train had crashed with a freight train. Rumors of horrible injuriesstoked fears for his father’s welfare, until a telegram assured him that EdwardCrowley was safe at dinner (and no other serious injuries had resulted from thecrash). To ensure that such accidents never happened again, Jonathan quicklyinvented “Crowley’s Safety Switch and Self-acting Railway Signals.” On November8—a week after the accident—he received provisional protection for his“improvements in the means of, or apparatus for, working the signals andswitches on railways.”57 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts057] Hebecame a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers,58[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts058] and a fellow of both theEthnological Society of London and the Royal Geographical Society of London.59[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts059] Jonathan Sparrow Crowley marriedAgnes Pope of Marylebone on May 14, 185360[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts060] and had three children: JonathanEdward (b. 1854, died in infancy), Agnes (1856–1916), and Claude Edmund(1865–1937).61 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts061] Their mother diedof tuberculosis in 1869 at age forty-three,62[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts062] leaving him with athree-year-old son and thirteen-year-old daughter.

She was the third child ofEdward Crowley senior, marrying the widower John Thrupp (1817–1870) on September21, 185466 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts066] and, tragically,dying within seventeen months.67 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts067]Thrupp was a solicitor and writer who began practicing in 1838, and in the early1840s published a series of historical law tracts; he evidently remained cordialwith the Crowleys despite remarrying: he was an executor of his father-in-law’swill, and—in partnership with Robert Dixon—represented the Crowley family in1865.68 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts068][images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_003_r1.jpg]Edward Crowley (c. 1830–1887), father of Aleister Crowley. (photo credit 1.4)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c01-fig004a]Although Edward Crowley Jr. is described in the 1851 census as an engineer likehis older brother Jonathan, Aleister Crowley noted that his father “was educatedas an engineer, but never practised his profession.”69[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts069] Indeed, one wonders if he everworked at all: Edward Crowley appears in postal directories and membership listsas “esquire,” indicating that he was upper gentry. The 1861 census lists hisoccupation/social status as “freeholder, householder,” while in 1881 he was“receiving income from houses and dividends.”70[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts070]Around 1853, the brothers Edward and Jonathan partnered with Robert White, azinc oxide manufacturer of King William Street, to form the company Crowley,White & Crowley. According to a notice in the Times, Robert White’s businesspartner, Langston Scott, had a patented process for manufacturing zinc oxide,which was a safe and economical substitute for white lead in the manufacture ofpaint; on his retirement on October 13, 1853, Scott vested the rights withCrowley, White & Crowley.71 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts071]Despite having won prizes at the Great Exhibition in Hyde Park in 1851 andsecuring the prestigious patronage of the Admiralty and the French government,the partnership dissolved in 1855.72[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts072] It is possible that AleisterCrowley alluded to his father’s business venture when he wrote in his commentaryon The Book of the Law, “ ‘white’ is ‘what champaks, zinc oxide, sugar, etc.,report to our eyesight.’ ”73 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts073]Shortly after dissolving this partnership, Edward Crowley, aged twenty-six,retired to devote himself to religion. He had been a devout Quaker fromchildhood, the dying utterance of the family’s servant Anne—“Lost, lost,lost”—demonstrating to him the fate of those souls not saved by Jesus.74[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts074] Breaking from his family’straditional Quaker roots, he became an Anglican clergyman,75[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts075] but eventually converted to thefundamentalist evangelical sect known as the Plymouth Brethren or Darbyists.76[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts076] By April 1861, he authored thetracts Letters Stating Sundry Reasons for Not Returning to the Church of Englandand Cease to Do Evil, Learn to Do Well. These were but the first of over onehundred that Edward Crowley would publish over the years as a preacher for theBrethren, earning him a mention in Knapp’s 1932 History of the Brethren.Notorious for frequent internal schisms, the Brethren movement ironically beganwith one man’s protest against denominationalism. Edward Cronin (d. 1882), aRoman Catholic, moved to Dublin in 1825 and declined to affiliate with the localAnglican Church of Ireland. At a time when society judged men by theircongregational membership, Cronin found himself ostracized by his neighbors.Citing Matthew 18:20 (“Where two or three are gathered together in my name,there am I in the midst of them”), Cronin claimed anyone could celebrate theLord’s supper, and thus began breaking bread with other religious outcasts. Heclaimed clerics, ministers, and priests were not only superfluous but alsocontrary to the will of God, since Matthew 18:20 clearly instructed worshipersto gather in the name of God, not of a priest.Within two years (1827), his meetings attracted a follower in John Nelson Darby(1800–1882), who became so influential that his name was synonymous with themovement. In 1830, Darby left the Anglican priesthood to devote himself to thegroup, and his tract “The Nature and Unity of the Church of Christ” helpedspread their message. In 1832, B. W. Newton invited Darby to organize hisassembly in Plymouth and share its ministry. This he did, and Plymouth quicklybecame the movement’s center.While Darby spent much of his time traveling to support the Brethren, Plymouthattracted 1,200 members by 1845, including generals and admirals, scholars andlinguists, and even English lords and other nobility—including a cousin of QueenVictoria. When he returned to Plymouth in 1845, Darby discovered Newtonattempting to establish an independent church with himself as pastor. Thiscontradicted the nondenominational and nonclerical ethos of the Brethren, andultimately, Darby excommunicated Newton and his followers.Within two years, the Brethren split into two factions: the Open Brethren, whobroke bread with good people of other faiths, and the Exclusive Brethren, led byDarby, who shunned all non-Brethren as sinners. It was but the first of a seriesof schisms that led the Exclusive Brethren to refuse friendship with adherentsof other Brethren variants, earning them the distinction of being “the narrowestand most bigoted sect on earth.”77[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts077] In 1879, the Exclusive Brethrenwent so far as to excommunicate their founder, Edward Cronin. Today, variousbranches are known by the names Darbyites, Newtonites, Mullerites, Grantites,Kellyites, Stuartites, Ravenites, Taylorites, etc.78[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts078]The Brethren believed the Bible—particularly the translation made by Darby—wasdivinely inspired and literally true. The faith was also pretribulational andpremillenial: believers expected Jesus to return at any moment to rescue thefaithful from the period of darkness about to begin. Long-term plans—includingretirement and life insurance—disclosed lack of faith in Jesus’ imminentarrival. All answers lurked within the Bible, the inevitable “It is written” or“Thus saith the Lord” with which they settled disputes, earning the Brethren thesarcastic designation of “walking Bibles.”Edward Crowley was a devout Exclusive Brother and a fiery, articulate clergyman.He distributed thousands of copies of his tracts through the mail and on thestreets. He routinely took walking tours throughout England, where he wouldpreach to the masses and draw large crowds for whom, at the time, proselytizingwas a respected fad. At other times, he would simply stop unsuspecting fellowson the street and ask what they were doing; after they answered, he would reply,“and then?” This question would repeat until the other inevitably answered withsomething like, “Well, I suppose I shall die.” This was the opening Crowleywaited for, when he would interject the phrase he was known for: “Then you’dbetter get right with God!”79 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts079] Hewould then add the wretched soul’s name and address to his book and for yearsafterward send religious literature. Edward Crowley traveled so extensively thathe could tell a person’s hometown from his accent.Eventually, he sold his shares in both the railway and the family brewery,reinvesting them in Amsterdam’s waterworks. This move was evidently prompted byhis religious convictions: Aleister Crowley reported that “my father wouldrefuse to buy railway shares because railways were not mentioned in the Bible”80[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts080] and later quoted his father asquipping sardonically that “he had been an abstainer for nineteen years, duringwhich he had shares in a brewery. He had now ceased to abstain for some time,but all his money was invested in a waterworks.”81[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts081] The specific waterworksinvestments are unknown, but a likely contender is the highly successfulAmsterdam Water Works Company, founded by English businessmen in 1865 and whose1872 expansion drew thousands of workers to the company.His new investment interests were quite likely what first brought him to thebaths, spas, and waterworks of Leamington.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_004_r1.jpg]Emily Bertha Crowley, née Bishop (1848–1917).

Theyoungest daughter of farmer John Bishop (c. 1793–1854) and his second wifeElizabeth Cole (1808–1896), Emily had gone from working in 1871 as governess forKensington brewer Alexander Gordon to marrying, on November 19, 1874, the devoutand independently wealthy Edward Crowley. The marriage took place at theregister office in Kensington, witnessed by her brother Tom Bond and herhalf-sister Anne, along with the families of Edward’s two siblings (Jonathancame with his daughter Agnes and second wife, Anne, while Mary came with herhusband, Charles).82 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts082] Because ofher slight form and vaguely Asian appearance, she was dubbed “the little Chinesegirl” at school. She had a talent with watercolors but, despite academictraining, never pursued art as a career. Now she was joining her husband toraise a family in the beautiful and affluent health resort town of LeamingtonSpa. Warwickshire’s spa on the river Leam was at the peak of a growth spurt thathad transformed a sleepy little borough of just over five hundred into a newlyincorporated town of 26,000 in 1875. Visitors flocked to its artesian wells andsaline springs, which were advertised to relieve the symptoms of gout,rheumatism, “stiffness of tendons,” and “other paralytic conditions.” Thegardens outside the Jephson and Royal Pump Rooms were likewise botanicalspectacles. Emily was already into her third trimester of pregnancy late thatsummer when she moved to 30 Clarendon Square, about four blocks from the Leam.Within six weeks, a sudden gale turned her idyll into a nightmare. On theSaturday morning of October 8, 1875, a violent storm struck Warwickshire,uprooting trees, breaking telegraph lines, and blocking roads. Flash floodsturned fields into lakes, inundated the baths and gardens, and spewed atwo-foot-deep river into the town’s Great Western railroad station. The flooddamaged crops, killed large numbers of livestock, and drowned two people. Whileit is unknown whether Emily was among those forced to flee in boats, it isdoubtful her property escaped flood damage.83[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts083]When the storm abated and the flood slowly began to recede, she went into labor.On Tuesday, October 12, 1875, between the hours of eleven and midnight, EmilyCrowley delivered a son to her husband. They dubbed him Edward, after his fatherand the father before him, with the middle name taken from his father’s friendAlexander. Edward Alexander Crowley would not change his name to Aleister untiladulthood, and to his family the child was simply known as Alick. He wastongue-tied, and within the first few days of his birth, a doctor cut the frenumthat connected his tongue to the bottom of his mouth. Despite the intervention,he would never pronounce the letter r correctly. Within his first three monthsof life, he was baptized into the Plymouth faith.Although previous biographers have portrayed Aleister Crowley’s childhood asmarred by religious intolerance, physical frailty, and the British schoolsystem, Crowley’s accounts reveal a happy boyhood through age ten, and heenjoyed the privileges of wealth throughout childhood. Granted, marriagerequired his mother to convert; and despite the Bishop family being evangelicalChristians, the Crowleys in true Exclusive form only associated with otherBrethren. This estranged Emily from her two siblings, Tom Bond (1839–1920) andAda Jane (1842–1896), and—from her father’s first marriage—three half-siblings,John (1821–1900), William (b. 1822), and Anne (1824–1890). Likewise, Aleisterrecalled that “My father’s religious opinions had tended to alienate him fromhis family.”84 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts084] Thus, AleisterCrowley’s childhood recollections—primarily from his Confessions and hisindictment of Victorian society, The World’s Tragedy—are largely populated byhis parents, the family servants, and other Brethren, such as his firstgoverness, Mary Arkell (1838–1892), “a grey-haired lady with traces of beardupon her large flat face and a black dress”; Mary Carey (born c. 1813), the“orange-coloured old lady … who used to bring him oranges”; Emma (born c. 1829)and Susan Cowper (born c. 1838), “Plymouth sister old maids” whom he neverparticularly liked; and portly Sister Musty, who had delayed a prayer meetingfor an hour by politely eating the food that Alick kept offering her.85[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts085]As the son of Exclusive Brethren, his was a Spartan childhood. The Crowleys didnot celebrate the pagan festival of Christmas. Likewise, Brethren prohibitionsforbade toys. When he learned to read at age four, Alick’s primary text was theBible. Recalling his father’s sermon on the word but, Alick once read throughthe book, circling every occurrence of the word.86[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts086] He idolized his father. Althoughthey shared little sympathy or understanding, Alick would grow up to be morelike him than he would ever realize.Although he described Emily Crowley as “the best of all possible mothers,”87[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts087] he was normally aloof towardher, regarding her as just another one of the servants.Servants were but one of the luxuries Alick enjoyed as a child. Although mostmiddle-class families in Victorian England had a servant—at the very least a“step girl” who scrubbed the front steps on Saturday mornings as a display ofaffluence for the neighbors—doctors, lawyers, and other professionals keptstaffs of at least three: a cook, a parlor maid, and a house maid.88[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts088] The Crowley household had fourservants, identified in census records as Mary Gough (age thirty-one), ElizabethHanad (age twenty-six), Fanny Maples (age twenty-two), and William Soden (ageseventeen).89 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts089] This fourthservant would have filled the typical role of manservant to the household. Whilelanded gentry and larger household estates boasted up to twenty servants, theCrowleys’ employment of more servants than there were household members revealstheir affluence.Likewise, Crowley’s accounts of his various residences, private tutors andboarding schools gives away the luxuries to which he was privy. Indeed hisentire childhood is set among some of Britain’s most notable locales. The familylived for five years in the resort town of Leamington Spa, stayed a while inSurrey near the Thames, then moved between various residences in and aroundLondon. Meanwhile, young Crowley attended boarding schools in places likeCambridge and Tonbridge (where he almost certainly attended the TonbridgeSchools, one of England’s top educational institutions). While not at boardingschool, he stayed with private tutors in locales like that international havenfor the rich and famous, Torquay, in the English Riviera. Similarly, his teenswere full of vacations climbing the hills, cliffs, and mountains of the Isle ofSkye (Scotland), Beachy Head (England), Tyrol (Austria), and the Swiss Alps.Crowley was unreservedly upbeat about his first decade of life. He fondlyrecalled the landmarks around Leamington Spa and Warwick such as Guy’s Cliffeand Warwick Castle; memories of the weir, or dam, on the Leam river remainedespecially fond, so that weirs forever after took him home again. Crowleyparticularly recalled walks with his father down main street and through thegreen fields. On one occasion, his father warned him away from a clump ofstinging nettles. “Will you take my word for it, or would you rather learn byexperience?” the patriarch cautioned his boy. The exuberant child retorted, “Iwould rather learn by experience,” and dove headlong into the nettles. Thispattern of chasing blindly after whatever captured his interest also typifiedmuch of his adult life.Equally formative in Crowley’s life were the family’s daily Bible readings:after breakfast each morning, the three Crowleys and their four servantsgathered in the dining room and took turns reading biblical verses aloud. Alickwas captivated by the unusual sounding names—such as those in his favoritechapter, Genesis 5—and voraciously absorbed his father’s sermons on thosefamiliar passages. Nevertheless, it was the woman whom he regarded as littlemore than one of the servants, his mother, who inspired Alick’s greatestfascination with the Bible: In moments of exasperation with her son, she wouldsay he was the beast prophesied in the Book of Revelation. This curiousassertion piqued his curiosity. The precocious youngster scurried back to hisBible and marveled at its apocalyptic conclusion, describing the tribulations tobefall mankind; the appearance of the great beast 666, who branded his number onthe foreheads of his followers; and the war in heaven between the woman clothedwith the sun and the devouring beast. Heaven’s angels, harps and miracles paledbeside the dragon, false prophet, and scarlet woman. He speculated on themessage of this story. And he pondered what it meant if his mother was right.Alick was four years old on February 29, 1880—a leap year—when his sister, GraceMary Elizabeth, was born. She suffered convulsions and lived only four hours.90[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts090] When he was taken that day tosee her body, Alick, too young to understand the joys of birth and the loss ofdeath, was indifferent. He could do nothing about his sibling’s demise, andfailed to understand why his parents bothered him with it.91[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts091] Nevertheless, Alick would feelGrace Crowley’s death through the subsequent changes in his life. Barely threemonths later, at the end of May, Edward Crowley left his home on the northwestside of Leamington. Although his whereabouts during this time are unknown, overa year later, on June 11, 1881, the Crowleys moved away from their painfulmemories to the Grange in Redhill, Surrey, which Aleister would later recall as“really an awfully nice place.”92[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts092]Their new home stood in a long garden that ended in woods overhanging the road.The sand pit across the road provided Alick with hours of amusement with hiscousin Gregor Grant, who became a frequent visitor and playmate. He was sixyears older than Alick, who remembered him as a Presbyterian “very proud of hispedigree.”93 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts093] The Crowleystolerated him because he was a relative; otherwise, all of Alick’s playmateswere children of local Brethren. These carefree times he recalled as perpetualhappiness.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_005_r1.jpg]The Grange, the Crowley family home in Redhill, Surrey. (photo credit 1.6)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c01-fig006a]When Alick turned eight, his father declared him old enough for boarding school.So Edward Crowley packed up his child to Hastings, where Henry TheodoreHabershon (c. 1828–1885) and his sons Henry Earnest (b. 1861) and Arthur Herbert(b. 1864), as Messrs. Habershon & Sons, ran the White Rock School at 10 PevenseyRoad in St. Leonards on Sea.94 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts094]Although not Brethren, they were extreme evangelicals, and as such wereentrusted with Alick’s education … but not with his virtue. Before depositinghis son at the school, Edward Crowley gave him one last lesson from Genesis,this time chapter nine:And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard: And he drank ofthe wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent. And Ham, thefather of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethrenwithout. And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both theirshoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; andtheir faces were backward, and they saw not their father’s nakedness. And Noahawoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him. And hesaid, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.He closed the Bible, looked sternly into his son’s eyes, and enjoined him,“Never let anyone touch you there.” Although the rendition greatly impressedAlick, the reference to sodomy was lost on the boy, who thought little of theinjunction at the time.Alick’s time passed without replication of the story of Noah, and in1885—following the death of Theodore Habershon95[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts095]—he transferred to a school forsons of the Brethren. Located at 51 Bateman Street, Cambridge, itsthirty-one-year-old headmaster, Reverend Henry d’Arcy Champney (1854–1942),seemed just the man to teach Alick: he had received his master of arts degreefrom Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and although ordained an Anglican in1878, he converted to the Brethren faith four years later, writing hymns for thefaithful. A true zealot, he voted for Parliament by crossing out the candidates’names and writing in “I vote for King Jesus.” According to Crowley, Champney wasso pious he claimed never to have had marital relations with his wife. At thetime, such claims meant no more to Alick than his father’s warning againstsodomy.Extracurricular activities at the school were rigorously religious. Although theboys played cricket, scoring was forbidden lest they commit the sin ofemulation. Prayers, ceremonies, meetings, Bible readings, and sermons filledeach Sunday, with only two hours allocated for other activities, such as readingbooks sanctioned for Sundays. On Monday nights, “Badgers’ Meetings” opened thebig schoolroom to feed and proselytize the residents of Cambridge’s slum,Barnswell; alas, the visitors often left a bit of themselves behind, resultingin epidemics of ringworm, measles, and mumps at the school. Champney regardedillness among the boys as God’s punishment for some undisclosed sin.“Alec,” as he now called himself, was initially happy at this school, writingexuberant letters home. Following in his father’s footsteps, Alec decided to bethe most devoted servant of Jesus in the whole school:I perceived a difficulty in the Scriptures. The beginning of my fall? I couldnot see how any one could be three days and three nights in the grave betweenFriday night and Sunday morning. I took my trouble to one of the masters, whoadmitted his own perplexity upon the point … he simply said that no one had beenable to explain it. Then and there I resolved to astonish the world. Alas forboyish ambitions; the problem is still unsolved.96[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts096]He excelled in academics, and received White’s Selbourne prize for being at thetop of his class in “religious knowledge, classics and French.”97[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts097]Around 1886, Alec also began writing his first poems. One of his earliestefforts, “Death of a Drunkard,” reveals that the boy’s exposure to poetry hadbeen confined to Brethren hymns:Just what the parson had told me when young:Just what the people in chapel have sung:“Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging.”98[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts098]Bright and amiable, the other boys liked and admired him, and he made manyfriends.Nearly a year passed before Alec was suddenly called home in the middle of hisspring 1886 term.Edward Crowley was sick. Ironically, Dr. Paget had diagnosed the preacher withcancer of the tongue and recommended immediate surgery. The Crowleys couldn’thave asked for a more qualified opinion. Sir James Paget (1814–1899) had servedas Queen Victoria’s surgeon in 1858, nearly three decades previously. He hadsince gone on to describe the second most common bone disease—subsequentlycalled Paget’s disease—in 1876. He became a baronet in 1871, and by the timeEdward Crowley became his patient in 1886, Paget presided over variousprofessional medical societies.The Brethren gathered to decide the Lord’s will in this matter, and Alec wasbrought home for moral support. In the end, they decided against surgery.Instead, Edward Crowley began seeing Count Cesare Mattei (1809–1896), inventorof electrohomeopathy, which purports to treat ailments through the therapeuticbioenergy in plant extracts. This new form of treatment generated interest inEngland at the time: Dr. A. S. Kennedy of St. Saviour’s Hospital in London hadjust published Notes on Count Mattei’s Electro-Homeopathic Remedies (1886),which advertised a cure “for Cancer and Kindred Diseases.”99[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts099] The Crowleys sold the Grange andmoved to Glenburnie in Southampton to be closer to the Count.100[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts100]Although the doctors were optimistic and his father experienced no pain, thespecter of death haunted Alec back at school. About a year later, on March 5,1887, Alec woke from a disturbing dream about his father’s death. The next dayhe learned his father had died the very night of his dream. Edward Crowley, atage fifty-two, was worth £150,000, equivalent to roughly $6 million by modernstandards.101 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts101] He left hisforty-one-year-old widow one-third of his estate; Alec would inherit anotherthird—$2 million—when he came of age; and the final third went to otherrelatives, to whom Alec was legatee.Alec’s “boyhood in hell,” as he later called it, began after the funeral. Thatwas when everything changed: Emily adopted Edward Crowley’s cause, dutifullysending Brethren literature to the people in her husband’s address book. Shealso sold their house and spent the next year or two living in various hotels.Beneath the surface, however, she also changed as a person. This transformationresulted from yet another schism in the Exclusive Brethren. Known as the RavenDivision after brother Frederick Edward Raven (1837–1903), it bitterly sunderedfriends and families over a doctrinal point regarding baptism: whether one wasreborn into eternal life, or whether eternal life was attained through faithalone.102 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts102] Emily Crowley took theminority view and wilfully cut herself off from her dissenting intimates.Despite the love she once professed for them, none, she now believed, wouldreach heaven. Sadly, just as Edward Crowley’s faith had estranged Emily frommost of her family, her own fanaticism now separated her from her friends.How people could number among God’s chosen one day and collectively join thelegions of the damned the next perplexed Alec. Reflecting on the images of hischildhood, he saw Mary Carey, the Cowpers, Sister Musty, and others who werepractically relatives now condemned to hell. In the boy’s eyes, his motherbecame “a brainless bigot of the most narrow, logical, and inhuman type.”103[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts103] Or, as he explained elsewhere,perhaps a bit more kindly, she was “marred beyond belief by the religiousmonomania which perhaps started in what one may call ‘Hysteria ofWidowhood.’ ”104 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts104] For all thatwidowhood changed his mother, the religious schism among the Brethrendemonstrated to Alec the problems of his faith. For an adolescent challengingand rejecting all that his parents held dear, he found Plymouth piety to behypocritical.Despite belonging to the Exclusive Brethren, Emily reestablished contact withher family after Edward’s passing, and they appear for the first time inAleister Crowley’s various accounts of his childhood. Emily’s brother, with whomshe often stayed in London, ought to have made a natural surrogate parent forAlec. Tom Bond Bishop (1839–1920) had moved to London around the time his ownfather had died of natural causes in 1854. He worked in the civil service as acustoms clerk, advancing to a lucrative position. Known in philanthropic circlesas an evangelical Christian, “T. B. B.” founded the Children’s Special ServiceMission in 1867, which quickly grew to include the Children’s Scripture Unionand Our Own Magazine, a one-penny monthly magazine of inspirational stories forchildren that he edited for many years. He was also a founding member of CivilService Prayer Union, serving on its committee from July 1881 until he resignedin 1889 from “over work.”105 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts105] Hewas every bit as devoted to God as Edward Crowley. However, while Edward’sdevotion garnered Alec’s respect, Uncle Tom’s earned nothing but scorn. A rigidand devout man, he represented all that Crowley came to hate about religion, andhe remembered his uncle bitterly. “No more cruel fanatic, no meaner villain,ever walked this earth,” he wrote in his memoirs.106[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts106] He attributed White Stains, hisDecadent book of erotic verse, to a fictional character bearing Tom’s familyname. In later years, Crowley published his uncle’s obituary prematurely,107[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts107] and verbally attacked him whilereviewing his book Evolution Criticised.108[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts108]Whereas the death of Alec’s sister barely registered on his consciousness atall, the passing of his father changed his life. In 1887, psychology was stillin its infancy and no grief counselors were available to help the boy adjust tohis loss. In Alec’s situation, typical adolescent coping strategies wereunavailable: no family member felt close enough for him to talk to. The latestBrethren schism had cut him off from most social contact, and Emily had become,in his own words, hysterical. He could not turn to religion for comfort becausehe connected the Brethren faith with his difficulty. At age eleven, the boyfound himself compelled to leave his carefree existence behind and become theman of the household. As biographer Martin Booth notes, it is at this point inhis Confessions that Crowley begins referring to himself in the first person.While grieving children experience feelings of isolation and loneliness, forAleister Crowley it was genuine. Research indicates that parental death doesn’tdirectly affect long-term child adjustment, but short-term symptoms likeanxiety, delinquency, and psychosomatic illness are common.109[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts109] Within three weeks of his returnto Bateman Street, Alec made his first of many visits to the headmaster’soffice. While Crowley fails to describe his misdeeds, he admits the firstinfractions were minor and were dismissed as an expression of grief. Soon,punishment became more severe: fifteen strokes “on the legs, because floggingthe buttocks excites the victim’s sensuality!—15 minutes prayer, 15 more strokesof the cane—and more prayer to top it!”110[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts110] Then, one day after prayer time,Alec found himself in Champney’s office, not knowing why.One of the children had described Crowley’s latest misdeed, and Champney wanteda confession. To his dismay, he received only protestations of innocence. “Come,come, Crowley,” the headmaster prodded impatiently. “You know that the Lord hasa special care of this school, and he brings to light that which is done indarkness.” Champney offered a sermon peppered with fire and brimstone—not tomention several threats for good measure—before his patience reached an end.“Confess, boy,” he insisted, his eyes bulging like blisters on his face. At thatpoint, Alec would have admitted to anything just to be rid of Champney. But noteven knowing the charges, his only answer was silence. His sentence for refusingto come clean was placement in “Coventry,” meaning that no master or boy couldspeak to Alec nor he to them. During play hours, he would work; during workhours, he would wander the empty school yard. Social contact was forbidden, andin his isolation he would receive only bread and water. To end it, all Alec hadto do was confess.Uncle Jonathan Crowley was a striking contrast to Alec’s father. He had twochildren from a previous marriage, and his present wife was the children’sformer governess. Like his brother Edward, he inherited both the familyfortune—managing to live well without being ostentatious—and good looks. AsCrowley wrote:The tremendous brow, the eagle eyes, the great hooked arrogant nose, the firmmouth and the indomitable jaw combined to make him one of the most strikinglyhandsome men that I have ever seen.111[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts111]Clearly, for Alec the Crowley side of the family tree basked in Edward’s halo,while the Bishop branch was tainted with the same bigotry with which he paintedhis mother.Alec looked unnaturally pallid and weak when Jonathan Crowley visited him atschool during the following term. Although the boy made no complaints, hismistreatment was obvious. Hearing about the Badgers’ Meeting and subsequentringworm outbreaks, Jonathan bristled. He confronted Champney and, threateningto call in the authorities, forced him to discontinue the practice. He thenarranged for his nephew to see Justice Stirling in order to determine any othermistreatment at the school. This move intimidated Alec, who did not understandthe legal system and feared that complaints could mean prison sentences for hismother or Uncle Tom. He insisted unconvincingly that he was perfectly happy atschool, and so he was sent back.By the time he went home that Christmas, Alec’s health had deteriorated so badlythat even Emily asked questions. This time, Alec described his mistreatment, andshe promised to take care of it. Her solution was to take Alec for a visit toher brother’s house, where unbeknownst to the child, Champney awaited. When hestepped inside Uncle Tom’s, Alec’s blood ran cold and his skin paled even more.He hid in the corner and uttered no complaints. After the holiday, he returnedto school to complete his sentence.The next term was nearly over when, during a visit by Uncle Tom, Alec describedbeing placed in “Coventry” for something he had supposedly done. Tom, in whatCrowley later called “a lucid interval,”112[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts112] marched over to Champney’soffice and insisted on knowing the charges. Accusations of drunkenness andsodomy convinced Tom to take Alec home. Shortly thereafter, several otherparents reached the same conclusion about Champney, and the school reportedlyclosed.113 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts113] For Alec, however,the damage—both physical and psychological—had already been done: the doctorconfirmed that Alec was indeed very ill. He had albuminuria—traces of albumin inhis urine, suggesting kidney disease—and it was so serious that Alec wasexpected never to reach adulthood. The physician could only offer a prescriptionfor country air.This news must have been staggering. For Emily, she had lost her husband and nowher only child had been handed a death sentence. Jonathan Sparrow Crowley hadsuffered from albuminuria for the past twenty years; right around this time, hewould have begun vomiting blood and, after three weeks, would die on September13, 1888.114 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts114] This could onlyhave added gravity to Alec’s prognosis. And the boy lost another respected malerole model in his life.Emily Crowley moved in with her brother Tom in what is now Drayton Gardens. WhenAlec’s interest turned to books, he found his choices proscribed by the dogma ofhis mother and uncle: Charles Dickens’s David Copperfield (1850) was forbiddenbecause of the character named Emily, lest Alec grow to disrespect his mother.Sophocles’ Oedipus Rex was plain inappropriate, even though he had been expectedto learn it in school. Worst of all was Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s The Rime ofthe Ancient Mariner (1798) because the mariner’s encounter with the water snakesends with the words “And I blessèd them unaware”115[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts115] … and everyone knew snakes werecursed in Genesis. This was a far cry from Edward Crowley, who once defendedAlec’s reading of Robert Michael Ballantyne’s children’s book Martin Rattler: ABoy’s Adventures in the Forests of Brazil (1869) on a Sunday by telling Emily,“If the book is good enough to read any other day, then why not on Sunday? Everyday is the Lord’s Day. The Jews observe a Sabbath, not us.” Those days wereover, and now Alec had to sneak books home under his coat and lock himself inthe bathroom to read them.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_006_r1.jpg]Alec at age fourteen. (photo credit 1.7)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c01-fig007a]The whole business of religion became intolerable. As he later put it, “I didnot hate God or Christ, but merely the God and Christ of the people whom Ihated.… The Christianity of hypocrisy and cruelty was not true Christianity.”116[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts116] All his woes came down to oneword: sin. He lived in constant fear of it, stood accused and punished in itsname, and lived miserably by its avoidance.No more, he concluded. If everybody was so mistaken about God, they could alsobe wrong about sin. Thus, he decided to become a sinner. But not just anysinner: with the same zeal he showed over the theological poser of Christ’sthree days in the grave, Alec decided to become the world’s best sinner. Pettytransgressions like theft wouldn’t do. Instead, he contemplated the ultimatespiritual wrong: the only sin that could not be forgiven, the sin against theHoly Ghost. Nobody knew what it was, and even to guess was considered blasphemy.Maybe he couldn’t prove how Jesus was three days and three nights upon the crossfrom Friday to Sunday; but he vowed to solve this riddle. Once he discoveredwhat this sin was, he resolved to do it, and thoroughly.But what might it be? Was there a clue in the story his father told him aboutNoah? Did it have something to do with that mysterious activity Champney neverengaged in with his wife? How did the accusations made against him at school fitin? He had a lot to learn about this business of sin.Until he either died or was well enough to return to school, it was decided Alecwould be taught by tutors handpicked by his Uncle Tom. In qualifications,academic credentials ranked second to religious faith, with the ability toengage Alec in his health-building regimen of travel, climbing, and fishing adistant third. His tutors were consequently fundamentalist degree-holders fromminor Cambridge colleges. Alec considered them all to be his physical andintellectual inferiors and, compelled to get the better of them, watched tutorscome and go so quickly that he soon lost count.In the spring of 1891, at age fifteen, he embarked on a rest cure for whoopingcough that consisted of a bicycle trip117[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts117] to the seaside resort of Torquayin the southwest of England. Although it would later become famous as thebirthplace of Agatha Christie (a year earlier, in 1890), Torquay—along withPaginton and Brixham—was known as the English Riviera and enjoyed aninternational reputation as a haven for the rich and famous. Alec’s latest tutorand chaperone was James Archibald Douglas (b. 1866), a twenty-five-year-oldteacher of arts and philosophy from Sheffield, Yorkshire.118[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts118] Alec collapsed twenty-eightmiles outside of London, too ill to proceed, so the pair continued by train totheir destination at 5 Cary Parade.Despite the journey’s failure, the vacation proved most educational. As anOxford University graduate and Bible Society missionary, Douglas had much toteach Alec, but most important was his refreshing—and surprising—normality. Thistutor smoked and drank. He also played cards and billiards. And he thought womenwere a welcome pleasure in life, not vehicles of sin. Most importantly, however,he demonstrated one could safely enjoy these things in moderation. Far from hisstifling home life, Alec found a completely new outlook. Crowley records, “Hetaught me sense and manhood, and I shall not easily forget my debt to him.”119[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts119]During the first ten days of his rest cure, Alec fell in love with a girl fromthe local theater. Together they retreated into a field to explore theirattraction. Savoring the feeling of the spring breeze, sunshine, and soft skinagainst him, the fifteen-year-old lost much more than his virginity. He realizedsex was not a subject of evil and sin; he understood its joy and beauty. And inthat awakening he shed his obsession with sin like a heavy winter jacket.Alec was soon well enough to attend part time a Streatham day school south ofLondon. Here he discovered smoking, one of the top two on his Uncle Tom’s hitparade of sin. He recalled with amusement his uncle’s attempt to convey to himthe moral of an article that he had written for Boys’ Magazine on the evils ofdrinking and smoking, “The Two Wicked Kings.” “Alec, my lad,” he summoned theboy over.“Yes, Uncle?”Tom replied predictably: “ ‘O my prophetic soul! mine uncle!’ ”Alec knew this response well and, having by now learned Hamlet, quicklycompleted the quote: “ ‘Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast.’ ”“Do you know of the two wicked kings?” Tom continued, undaunted. After a pause,he answered for Alec. “Drin-king and smo-king?”Alec, having read the article, pointed out, “But, Uncle, you have forgotten tomention a third, the most dangerous and deadly of all.”Uncle Tom pondered the riddle for a moment and drew a blank. Alec’s crude butastute identification—whether it was fuc-king or wan-king he does notsay—stunned him.To Alec, this “wicked king” business was just another example of Uncle Tom’smisguided enthusiasm. Papa had drunk wine, claiming he would rather preach tomiserable drunkards than self-righteous teetotalers. Drinking, therefore,couldn’t be a serious offense. But Papa had also said, “If God had intended manto smoke, He would have supplied a chimney at the top of his head.” Theobservation did nothing to deter the habit Alec had learned at Streatham.In recovery, Alec became a handsome young man. His hair was neatly cropped andhis eyes dark, penetrating, brooding. Expressive lips and a wide square chinsupported his features. His body possessed the sinew and virility of a young manin his prime. Suddenly, he found himself desirable to young women.Alec thrilled when the new parlor maid120[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts120] flirted with him, but, tooinexperienced to know how to respond, he shied away until, on her night off, heworked up the courage to flirt with her during a cab ride. Then, one Sunday,when Alec made some excuse not to join the family at church, he led the maidinto his mother’s bedroom. For Alec, the thrill of seducing her on the bed ofhis pious mother was more than just an adolescent expression of oedipal urge; itwas a victory over religious oppression.Alec understood the maid’s flirting as simply an attempt to gain a betterposition in the household. However, when she complained to Tom Bond Bishop ofhow his nephew had corrupted her innocence, she found herself dismissed withoutreferences. Confronted with the story, Alec flatly denied the allegations. Onthe condition that he not be punished, he confessed that on one of the nights inquestion he was at the tobacconist’s with wicked school companions who had ledhim astray. Although he got off by pleading guilty to a lesser charge, the liehaunted him:First we have a charming girl driven to attempt blackmail, next a boy forced tothe most unmanly duplicity in order to exercise his natural rights withimpunity, and incidentally to wrong a woman for whom he had nothing but thefriendliest feelings. As long as sexual relations are complicated by religious,social and financial considerations, so long will they cause all kinds ofcowardly, dishonourable and disgusting behaviour.121[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts121]The best thing to come of this unfortunate circumstance was Uncle Tom’s decisionthat Streatham provided a poor example for Alec.On November 5, 1891, less than a month after his sixteenth birthday, Alecbrought a ten-pound jar home from the grocer and filled it with two pounds ofgunpowder. This he topped with metallic salts, sugar, and potassium chlorate. Hedug a hole in the ground, inserted the jar, and lit the concoction. Theexplosion shattered windows nearby and left a large crater in the ground. Alecfell unconscious on the ground without ever hearing the boom, countless piecesof gravel embedded in his face. It would be Christmas before his eyes healedenough to be briefly exposed to light. Of focusing on his other senses withoutbenefit of eyesight, he later recalled, “I did learn quite a lot from my famousGuy Fawkes day, when the bandages were on my eyes for 40 days.”122[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts122]Tom realized Alec had too much time on his hands—and idle hands were, after all,the devil’s playthings—and decided once again to send him to school. Thus, inthe spring of 1892, Alec went to stay in Huntingdon’s No. 4 in Malvern,Worcestershire, a small town in the English Midlands. Here he enrolled in amilitia, the First Worcestershire Artillery Volunteers.123[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts123] The school had a name in sports,and Alec—not well enough to participate—became the butt of abuse. He grewpainfully familiar with two great pastimes of bullies everywhere: greasing(spitting into someone’s face) and pill-ragging (clenching someone’s testicles).At the school, Crowley recalled, “Buggery was the rule”;124[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts124] his study companion even mademoney as a prostitute. He parlayed this information into a speedy transfer forthe following year.Alec spent his summer vacationing with his mother on Scotland’s Isle of Skye,whose main attraction is the hilly terrain known as the Black Cullins. Here Alecmet Sir Joseph Lister (1827–1912) at the Sligachan Inn. Lister, althoughremembered as the physician who introduced antisepsis to surgery, was also anavid mountaineer, and he persuaded a group of climbers to take Alec up the3,162-foot Sgurr-nan-Gillean. Crowley was hooked by the experience, which markedthe first of many competitive climbs. During his vacation in Skye thatSeptember, he also climbed Sgurr a’ Ghreadaidh (3,192 feet), Bruach na Frìthe(3,143 feet), Am Basteir (3,064 feet), Sgurr a’ Mhadaidh (3,012 feet), and theBloody Stone (33 feet).125 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts125]That fall of 1892, he transferred to the Tonbridge School in Kent, where hishouse was Ferox Hall.126 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts126] Locatedin historic Tonbridge with its thirteenth-century motte-and-bailey castles,Tonbridge School was one of the nation’s top schools. Founded in 1553 by SirAndrew Judde (c. 1492–1558), it rested on 150 acres at the north edge ofTonbridge; it had been largely rebuilt as the school grew in size and status inthe second half of the nineteenth century.Early in his fall term, Alec again took ill. As he recalls cryptically in TheWorld’s Tragedy:My health broke down; partly, one may say, through what would have been my ownfault or misfortune if I had been properly educated; but, as it was, was thedirect result of the vile system that, not content with torturing me itself,handed me over bound and blindfold to the outraged majesty of Nature.127[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts127]A marginal note in his personal copy of the book clarifies: he “caught the clapfrom a Glasgow prostitute.”Boarding school seemed too strenuous for Alec, so his mother sent him toEastbourne to live with a Brethren tutor named Lambert. There he enjoyed morefreedom than he expected from a Darbyist. He wrote more poetry, which hecontributed to both the Eastbourne Gazette and The Christian.128[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts128] He also spent much of his freetime playing chess, easily beating the best players in town, and eventuallywriting the “Chess Notes” column for the Eastbourne Gazette under the pseudonymTa Dhuibh.129 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts129] That spring andsummer, he climbed literally dozens of peaks in Snowdonia, Wales, and inEngland’s Lake District.130 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts130] Hispassions for poetry, chess, and mountain climbing blossomed.With chalk cliffs rising 575 feet above sea level, Beachy Head is the highestheadland on England’s south coast. Its crumbling edifice projects into theEnglish Channel from its location in East Sussex on the east end of South Downs.British mountaineer Edward Whymper (1840–1911) and his brother nearly killedthemselves trying to climb it in the mid-1800s.Victorian England birthed and buried the craze of chalk-cliff climbing. Itoriginated with some bright alpinist’s contention that Britain’s sea cliffs madegreat practice mountains when, in fact, their chalk faces crumbled too readilyto be climbed safely. After he had become a seasoned climber, Crowley wrote,“English rock climbing is the most severe and difficult in the world.”131[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts131] Walter Parry Haskett Smith’s(1859–1946) guidebook Climbing in the British Isles: England132[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts132] declared that the chalk cliffsof Sussex were climbable only up to twenty feet above high-water mark. Similarclaims were made by Albert Frederick Mummery (1855–1895), whom the Encyclopaediaof Mountaineering calls “the foremost climber of the second half of the lastcentury, with justifiable claims to be regarded as the founder of modernAlpinism.”Crowley, looking upon Beachy Head in 1894, doubted these estimates. Having spentthe previous summer climbing in England with his cousin Gregor Grant—whom hedescribed as someone “who considers climbing for climbing’s sake as stupid, ifnot actually sinful”133 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts133]—Crowleybelieved they could conquer this unclimbable cliff. He surveyed the edifice andnoted its most conspicuous pinnacles: the peak closest to the sea was known asthe Devil’s Chimney and consisted of two pinnacles separated by a gap: theNeedle was the outermost peak, and the Tooth was innermost. Further inlandbeside it was Etheldreda’s Pinnacle, with the Cuillin Crack’s two-hundred-footcliff overhanging it. They began climbing on April 4.Passing to the top of the grassy slope that ran along the base of the Devil’sChimney, they marveled at the beautiful sight of the sunlit cliffs before them,the sea behind, and the clouds above. To the right of the Cuillin Crack was acleft, which Crowley named Etheldreda’s Walk after his dog,134[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts134] that ran “round Etheldreda’sPinnacle, to the foot of Grant’s Chimney.” Etheldreda’s Pinnacle was accessibleby twin chimneys—deep grooves in the cliff wall—that stretched before him likechalk incarnations of Castor and Pollux. He liked the analogy and thus dubbedthe chimneys after the Greek twins. Crowley began climbing Castor, the northaccess way, until its chalk face gave way and buried his legs in a cloud ofrubble. Undeterred, he wriggled free of the debris and pressed on. Progress wasslow, even glacial, to avoid further mishaps; to the Scottish MountaineeringClub Journal, Alec described his ascent as “a chemical combination of thewrithe, the squirm, and the slither.” Arriving at the top and sitting upon itssquare summit, he could feel Etheldreda’s Pinnacle teeter and sway beneath him.Cleare and Collomb, in their account of sea-cliff climbing in Britain, write,“The traverse on a chalk and grass slope of 50 degrees’ steepness below thecliff proved to be a nightmare of insecurity. One can therefore only marvel atCrowley and his friends who managed to effect a traverse on this slope.”135[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts135]They returned three months later, on July 4, to tackle the Devil’s Chimney,conquering several landmarks and deeming others unclimbable. Of climbing theTooth, Crowley reported,Both the N[orth] and E[ast] faces were coated with loose layers of chalk, whichcame away with a single touch, but the E[ast] had the advantage of being lessvertical.… The laborious nature of the climbing is evidenced by the fact thattwo hours and more were required to overcome a vertical height of only thirtyfeet.136 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts136]Subsequent climbs took place on July 11 and 13 and on October 1. Despite havingdeemed the Needle unclimbable from his promontory atop Etheldreda’s Pinnacle,Crowley set his sights on its peak on July 13. Proceeding into the gap thatseparated the twin peaks of the Tooth and the Needle, Alec sought a surfacesolid enough to climb. Cutting steps into the nearly vertical walls provedfutile. After five failed attempts, Alec finally scooped out a hole in the wall,planted his chin in it, and used his free hands to haul himself up. Using thisunconventional tactic, he emerged on the other side of the gap, after whichascent of the Needle was easy. While Gregor waved the Union Jack from theTooth’s pinnacle, Crowley gazed proudly from the top of the Needle, surveyingthe landscape below. They stood where no one else had ever stood, achieved whatno climber had before. They had conquered the Devil’s Chimney.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_007_r1.jpg]The Devil’s Chimney at Beachy Head, July 13, 1894, showing Gregor Grant atop theTooth (right) and Aleister Crowley atop the Needle (left). (photo credit 1.8)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c01-fig008a]Their October 1 attempt on Cuillin Crack was less successful. Crowley judgedthis ascent “the finest and most difficult piece of climbing that I have yetfound in the whole neighbourhood.”137[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts137] Consequently, after scaling thefirst sixty feet or so of its two-hundred-foot height, he became too exhaustedeither to climb further or to pull up Gregor. Thus Alec remained wedged in thecrack while his cousin fetched the coast guard to lower a rope and help pull himout.These ascents are best understood in retrospect. The sport of chalk-cliffclimbing is esoteric, and its Victorian period “would have been inconsequentialwere it not for Aleister Crowley.”138[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts138] Etheldreda’s Pinnacle, thoughonly twenty-five feet high, is rated a “very severe” climb, and Cleare andCollomb dubbed Crowley’s ascent “a remarkable achievement and in concept yearsahead of its time.”139 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts139] Crowley’sattempt of Cuillin Crack—probably omitted from his memoirs because its abortiveattempt required his rescue—was nevertheless so important that the feature isnow called Crowley’s Crack. Although others soon repeated the climbs, sea-cliffclimbing died out within six years. No other ascents were recorded until thesport experienced a rebirth in the 1980s; today, the upper part of the Devil’sChimney has collapsed into the sea.If history accords Crowley a place for his climbs, this was not the case at thetime. The initial response to his achievements left Alec cold. A local newspaperbegan its coverage of the climb with the words, “Insensate folly takes variousforms.” Mummery initially dismissed Crowley as a braggart. Before long, however,these climbing records on Beachy Head were verified, and Alec establishedhimself as a pioneer of the short-lived sport of sea-cliff climbing.Shortly after this victory, Gregor announced his engagement and that he could nolonger climb on Beachy Head with his cousin, but Alec’s love of climbingcontinued unabated. He traveled to Tyrol, Austria, with his tutor and attemptedhis first Alpine climbs. Unable to find a satisfactory guide, he set out with A.E. and M. W. Maylard and climbed the Schrötterhorn nearly to the top, despitethe bad snow, as well as Vertainspitze. In the Italian Alpine village of Suldenhe made solo ascents of Monte Cevedale (12,382 feet), Suldenspitze (11,076feet), Tschengglser Hochwand (11,073 feet), Gran Zebrù (12,635 feet),Thurwieserpitze (11,982 feet), Ortler (12,812 feet), and others.140[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts140] While climbing the Ortler, hereached its peak by the Hintere Grant in only six and a half hours, where he metan American and his guide, who, he learned, had climbed up the other side … theeasy side. Alec never again climbed with guides, feeling safer relying on hisown instincts and natural talent. The Alps proved unforgettable, and Alec wouldreturn regularly for the next four years.In September 1894 he applied for membership in the Scottish Mountaineering Club.He was balloted for and elected at their December 7 meeting.141[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts141]Returning to Eastbourne from the Alps, Alec found relations with his tutorstrained. One day, he and Lambert got into an argument that turned critical whenLambert began throwing punches; Alec caught him in a hammerlock with one arm andpounded his tutor’s face with the other. Another incident involved Lambert’sdaughter, Isabelle, whom Crowley described as “the only pretty and decent memberof the family.”142 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts142] Overbreakfast, Alec watched her parents forbid her to see her fiancé because hewould not convert to the Brethren faith; when their admonishments and abusedrove her to tears, Alec interrupted to tell her parents how revolting and cruelhe found them. Another blowup ensued, and Lambert telegraphed Tom Bishop tofetch his nephew.The family row that Alec expected over this incident never materialized. Hismother, grateful to see Alec prosper in manhood rather than dying as the doctorshad predicted when they first diagnosed him with albuminuria, eased herstranglehold. And when he expressed his interest in the sport that had helpedturn him into a strapping young man, she sent him back to the Alps sanschaperone. He had come of age.If only in sheer numbers of ascents, 1895 was his best year for climbing.143[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts143] Returning to the Bernese Alps insouth-central Switzerland, Alec scaled many of its peaks, including the Eiger(13,025 feet), which he conquered alone. Noting no record of an ascent of Trift(7,667 feet) from the Mountet side, he and an “intelligent-looking youngEnglishman”144 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts144] named Ellisclimbed it in half a day. Other victories included the peaks of the Jungfrau(13,642 feet), Mönch (13,474 feet), and the Wetterhorn (12,113 feet). Manyalpinists—H. V. Read, W. Larden, O. Eckenstein, A. E. Maylard, and H. Sollyamong them—recognized AC, as Alec had become known, as a promising youngclimber, and several took him under their wings. Among them was Dr. John NormanCollie (1859–1942), whom he later described as “unquestionably the finestall-round climber of his generation.”145[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts145] Collie was about to embark onhis fateful expedition to Nanga Parabat, in which A. F. Mummery, with whom ACcorresponded about Beachy Head, would be lost. However, Collie proposed Crowleyfor membership in the Alpine Club, with Sir Martin Conway (1856–937)—who wouldlater preside over the Alpine Club from 1902 to 1904—seconding the motion; theapplication, however, was rejected. From that time, Crowley would have nothingbut scorn for the club. Founded in London in 1857, it was the world’s firstmountaineering club, and in those days it had many charateristics of agentlemen’s club—staid, exclusive, superior, and authoritarian—making it an easytarget for Crowley’s scorn.146 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts146]Another of Collie’s interests was the occult. Whether it was mysticism, magic,alchemy, or folklore, the unexplainable fascinated him. He believed in the LochNess Monster and reported being followed on Scotland’s highest summit, BenMacdui (4,295 feet), on Easter of 1891—whether by a ghost or by the legendary AmFear Lias Mòr (Scotland’s Sasquatch, the Big Grey Man) he did not speculate, buthe remarked that “No power on earth will ever take me up Ben Macdui again.”This, along with tales of old Gaelic mountain gods and goddesses, he would oftenrelate to friends around campfires or in his den, according to his biographerChristine Mill, “no one quite knowing how much he was believing himself.”147[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts147] As Crowley recalled, “NormanCollie, of all people, by the way, was very keen on alchemy in the days when weclimbed rocks together.”148 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts148] ThatCollie was also a scientist—an organic chemist at University College, laterdepartment chair and, after his 1928 retirement, professor emeritus—no doubtmade a great impression on Crowley, who would many years later define magick asan art and science, coining the phrase “the method of science, the aim ofreligion” and dubbing his methodology “scientific illuminism.” Not long aftermeeting Collie, Crowley would begin to consider himself a young authority onalchemy, expounding the subject to anyone who would listen. Most remarkably,Collie was but the first of three highly influential climber-chemists thatCrowley would meet in as many years.A telegram from home cut short AC’s perambulations upon the Bernese Oberland.Mother and Uncle Tom were sending him to Trinity College, Cambridge, andentrance exams were a week away."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWOA PLACE TO BURY STRANGERSThe halls of Trinity College, Cambridge, opened to AC in October 1895. There hetook a room in 16 St. John’s Street, far from the relatives who would have likedto choose his friends, teachers, and diversions. Instead, no Plymouth tutormonitored his actions for moral probity, and no censor told him what to do orread. Plus, as an adult, he was finally entitled to £50,000 in discretionaryfunds—equivalent to $2 million by today’s standards—from his father’s estate. Ashe would describe one of his own students many years later, he was free, white,and twenty.Gone was Edward Alexander Crowley, for, as a free man, he had no desire to go byhis given name. Gone too was the boy’s name Alec. So how should the chess,poetry, and mountaineering wunderkind be appropriately addressed? A cursoryexamination of his surname led him to conclude that Crowley derived from thecommon Irish O’Crowley. With poets W. B. Yeats and George Moore making Irelandand all things Irish fashionable at that time, AC naturally wished toparticipate in the Celtic revival. He therefore tried the Gaelic form ofAlexander: Aleister.He pondered it a moment and recalled reading that for fame, the best combinationof stressed and unstressed syllables were a dactyl followed by a spondee: thepattern of one long or accented syllable, two short, one long, one short … likeAlgernon Swinburne. Aleister Crowley. It fit the pattern. He liked it. And so hebecame known.Ranking highly among his first acts of independence was his refusal to attendchapel, lecture, or hall. He told the junior dean that chapel—obligatory Sundaymorning religious services—was forbidden by his Plymouth upbringing as beingoutside his faith, and that “the seed planted by my father, watered by mymother’s tears, would prove too hardy a growth to be uprooted.”1[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts001]When a political economics professor described the subject as very difficult dueto lack of reliable data, Aleister, favoring the discipline of mathematics andchemistry to what sounded like superstition, closed his notebook and returned toclass only for exams, which he passed easily. Finally, Cambridge’s 8:30 dinnerhour was untenable as it broke up what could otherwise be a productive evening.Raised in isolation from his peers, the thought of sitting in a dining hallfilled with his classmates was at best uncomfortable. Thus Aleister arrangedwith the kitchen to send food to his room at his convenience.Before long, he fell into a pattern of beginning work—reading, writing, andstudying—at midnight, an hour he was certain no social calls could interrupthim, and continuing straight through until dawn. When tired of toiling duringthese long nights, he wandered the campus alone, pondering how many great menhad walked in Neville’s Court; or watched from Garret Hostel Bridge as mistrolled over the river below; or, from his room, simply watched the sun rise overthe tower of St. John’s Chapel.While his nocturnal lifestyle left him with few friends at Cambridge, the taleof fellow undergraduates throwing Crowley into Trinity’s fountain2[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts002] is apocryphal at best.Cambridge’s debating society, the Magpie and Stump, attracted his attention from1895 to 1897, but he ultimately found it “absurd for these young asses to emittheir callow opinions on important subjects.”3[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts003] A better fit was the CambridgeUniversity Chess Club, where, in his first term, he beat its president, WilliamVawdrey Naish (1873–1956), and was humbled by Henry Ernest Atkins (1872–1955),future nine-time British chess champion.4[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts004] Crowley ultimately became thechess club’s president. Representing Cambridge in intervarsity matches, heusually won, as he did on March 27, 1896, when he came out of a lost position tobeat N. H. Robbins of Oxford, or in a February 20, 1897, match against the Cityof London Chess Club, where he bested Edward Bageshott Schwann (1872–1902), whohad received the Wills prize for an interclub record of twelve wins, threedraws, and no losses. However, fortune wasn’t always on Crowley’s side: in anApril 2, 1897, match against Oxford at the British Chess Club in Covent Garden,his opponent, E. George Spencer-Churchill (c. 1876–1964)—Winston Churchill’scousin—came from behind to win the match. Similarly, in a November 20, 1897,match between the Chess Club and the Senior Club, Crowley lost against WilliamHewison Gunston, MA (1856–1941), a fellow of St. John’s College, Cambridge, andwell-known chess player.5 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts005]His most influential friend at this time, however, was a senior named Adamson.AC left no record of him, probably because they were casual acquaintances, butthe Alumni Cantabrigienses lists a student named Henry Anthony Adamson(1871–1941), who matriculated to Trinity College in 1889 and received his BA in1892 and his MA in 1896.6 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts006] Heprofoundly changed Crowley’s life by introducing him to the poetry of PercyBysshe Shelley (1792–1822). For Crowley the budding poet, Shelley’s lyricalstyle and unique expressive language represented the perfect marriage of poetryand music. This was indeed a far cry from Plymouth devotional verse.Realizing he had never read real poetry before, Crowley lost all interest inhistory, geography, and botany. He stopped studying altogether, voraciouslyconsuming whatever poetry and literature he could find: in addition to poetslike Robert Browning and Algernon Swinburne, he also devoured the works ofwriters like playwright William Shakespeare, satirist Jonathan Swift, essayistThomas Carlyle, novelist Henry Fielding, historian Edward Gibbon, andadventurer-scholar Sir Richard Burton. “I was influenced by Ruskin’s7[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts007] imbecile remark that any bookworth reading was worth buying, and in consequence acquired books literally bythe ton.”8 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts008] Before long,floor-to-ceiling bookcases lined his apartment. Shelley nevertheless remainedCrowley’s lifelong favorite,9 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts009]influencing not only his writing but also his emulative passion for life.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_008_r1.jpg]Aleister Crowley as a young poet. (photo credit 2.1)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c02-fig001a]By 1896, AC was wearing a poet’s silk shirt with floppy hat and bow tie,constantly writing poetry. Everything—even campus landmarks—inspired a Shelleyanpassion in his own lyrical soul.My poetic instincts, further, transformed the most sordid liaisons intoromance … I found, moreover, that any sort of satisfaction acted as a powerfulstimulus. Every adventure was the direct cause of my writing poetry.10[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts010]His verse frequented Cambridge’s student publications The Granta, CambridgeMagazine, and Cantab.11 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts011]Fortunately when one of Crowley’s instructors, Greek scholar Arthur WoollgarVerrall (1851–1912), confronted him about his absence from lecture and heard hisstudent explain his newfound love for English literature, Verrall allowed him topursue this interest unimpeded.AC spent his 1896 winter vacation alone, sometimes secluded in the mountains andsometimes enjoying the long nights and cold clear air of northwestern Europe. “Iloved to wander solitary in Holland, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. There was amystery in the streets and a spontaneous gaiety in the places of amusement,which satisfied my soul.”12 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts012] OverEaster, he was one of thirty-two members of the Scottish Mountaineering Club inFort William for a wet and rainy meet.13[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts013] In the end he returned toBritain’s sea cliffs at Wastdale Head. There he reunited with Norman Collie, whohad mentored Crowley’s Alpine climbs the previous summer. He was back from histragic Himalayan climb in which A. F. Mummery (who had skeptically received AC’scorrespondence about Beachy Head) was killed. Crowley and Collie’s reunion wasnevertheless happy; together they demonstrated the puttees that Collie hadbrought back from Nanga Parabat. These leather leggings, secured by windinglaces around the calf, were handy for keeping snow out of one’s boots. Also atthis time, John Wilson Robinson (c. 1853–1907),14[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts014] who pioneered climbing inCumbria’s lake district, showed AC some of Wastdale Head’s easier climbs; snowygales prevented more difficult ascents. AC commemorated these climbs with thepoem “A Spring Snowstorm in Wastdale.”15[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts015]That summer he also returned to the Bernese Oberland, making the first guidelessascent of the Mönch (13,474 feet) on July 14, commemorated in his poem “ADescent of the Moench.”16 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts016] Othersolo unguided ascents at this time included the Aiguille de la Za (12,051 feet);Aiguilles Rouges d’Arolla (11,929 feet), immortalized in his poem “The Traverseof Aiguilles Rouges”;17 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts017] and theVuibez Séracs, an icefall that had probably never before been passed. Crowleywould later attribute this last accomplishment to his “quite uncanny faculty” to“divine the one possible passage through the most complex and dangerousicefall.”18 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts018] In addition, he anda companion made an unguided ascent of the Trifthorn (12,231 feet), as well as anew descent down its northwest face.19[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts019]Despite his literary interests, Crowley took Cambridge’s honors examination (theMoral Science Tripos) and tentatively chose the diplomatic service as hisprofession. His training included an 1897 stint learning Russian in St.Petersburg. Uninspired by the experience, he stopped on his return trip toattend a chess congress in Berlin. The roomful of stodgy old masters convincedhim that chess, despite his own skill and passion for the game, could be nothingmore than a hobby for him—albeit one he would enjoy through his last days. Hecame to the same realization about mountaineering—during 1897 he climbed the PicCoolidge (12,385 feet), crossed the Brèche de la Meije (11,014 feet), returnedto the Aiguille de la Za, and traversed Mont Collon (11,932 feet)20[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts020]—and his educational optionslooked no more promising.These observations culminated in an existential crisis in October 1897. Althoughdeath had been omnipresent ever since his childhood struggle with albuminuria,now he pondered: what would he have to show for his lifelong struggle when hedied? Would his career in the diplomatic service be quickly forgotten like thatof most politicians? What use was his beloved poetry when his Cambridge peershad never heard the name Aeschylus? And even if he succeeded as a greatpolitician or poet—a Caesar or Shakespeare—his eminence would eventually perishwith the death of mankind.Crowley determined to “find a material in which to work which is immune from theforces of change,”21 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts021] concludingthat only spiritual pursuits had eternal implications. Then and there herenounced the diplomatic service in favor of the spirit. Over thirty yearslater, asked why he did not seek fame, Crowley would reply cryptically, “Who wasour representative at the Sublime Porte, say, eight years ago?”Crowley’s experience of the First Noble Truth, however, was not that simple, asevidenced by another major awakening in his life.A year earlier—in December 1896—Crowley had been in Stockholm during theChristmas holiday. There, at midnight of New Year’s Eve, he joined what hecalled the Military Order of the Temple. As he later described it:I was awakened to the knowledge that I possessed a magical means of becomingconscious of and satisfying a part of my nature which had up to that timeconcealed itself from me. It was an experience of horror and pain, combined witha certain ghostly terror, yet at the same time it was the key to the purest andholiest spiritual ecstasy that exists.22[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts022]Crowley was never one to mince words about his mystical experiences, and thecouched euphemisms of this passage recall the polite if incomprehensibledescription of contracting venereal disease that he gives in The World’sTragedy. It appears that the “Military Order of the Temple” was a euphemism forCrowley’s awakening to his bisexuality, simultaneously stirring up feelings ofhorror from his upbringing along with quiescent relief. His poem “At Stockholm”addresses a secret forbidden love:We could not speak, although the sudden glowOf passion mantling to the crimson cheekOf either, told our tale of love, althoughWe could not speak.23 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts023]He wrote of events at this time that he “Hunted new Sins till October, ’97, whenone of them turned to bay, and helped me to experience the ‘Trance ofSorrow.’ ”24 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts024] Similar referenceto sin appears in an early poem from this period:He who seduced me first I could not forget.I hardly loved him but desired to tasteA new strong sin. My sorrow does not fretThat sore. But thou, whose sudden arms embracedMy shrinking body, and who brought a blushInto my cheeks, and turned my veins to fire,Thou, who didst whelm me with the eager rushOf the enormous floods of thy desire,Thine are the kisses that devour me yet,Thine the high heaven whose loss is death to me,Thine all the barbed arrows of regret,Thine on whose arms I yearn to beIn my deep heart thy name is writ alone,Men shall decipher—when they split the stone.25[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts025]This “new strong sin” was his friendship with H. C. J. Pollitt.Herbert Charles Pollitt (1872–1942) was the son of Westmorland Gazetteproprietor Charles Pollitt (born c. 1837) of Thorny Hills, Kendal, and his wifeJane, née Hutchinson (c. 1837–1892).26[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts026] Born on July 20, 1871, he, likeCrowley, was a gentleman of leisure owing to his family’s fortune and, aroundthe time of their October 1897 meeting, took the Christian name Jerome, by whichhe preferred to be called. He had matriculated to Trinity College, Cambridge, in1889, receiving his BA in 1892 and his MA in 1896. Although he failed to qualifyas a doctor, he later appeared in London’s 1901 census as a “medical servant,own means” and would go on to serve during the Great War as a Lance-Corporal inthe Royal Army Medical Corps, entering the 9159th regiment on August 27, 1914.27[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts027]As early as 1892, Pollitt was a member of the Footlights Dramatic Club, where hewowed audiences as a female impersonator. Although his stage name “Diane deRoughy” was an homage to French actress-courtesan Liane de Pougy (1869–1950),American avant-garde dancer Loie Fuller (1869–1928) was the model for histrademark serpentine scarf dance, which became so famous at Cambridge that itfeatured in two of Arthur Pilkington Shaw’s plays: The Mixture and The MixtureRemixed.28 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts028] Pollitt’sperformances would reputedly “make many women green with envy.”29[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts029] According to Hobbs,30[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts030] Pollitt was, in his day, one ofthe most talked-about undergraduates at Cambridge, his rooms hung with the worksof Rops, Whistler, and Beardsley, and his bookshelves stocked with theDecadents.Decadence was a fin de siècle literary and artistic movement dealing with socialand physical decay, originating in Paris with Theophile Gautier’s Mademoisellede Maupin (1834), which juxtaposed beauty against gross and corrupt events. Ageneration later, Gustave Flaubert—best known for Madame Bovary (1857)—populatedhis series of set pieces in The Temptation of Saint Anthony (1874) withandrogynes, sphinxes, paganism, and the devil such that the pieces, taken as awhole, formed a cohesive tale. In 1884, two more influential offerings focusedon moral decay, sexual perversity, materialism, Satanism, and nihilism: theRosicrucian Joséphin Péladan’s Le Vice Suprême and Joris-Karl Huysman’s classicA Rebours (Against Nature). The movement became so influential that many authorscontemporary with Crowley—Arthur Symons (1865–1945), Oscar Wilde (1854–1900),and 1923 Nobel laureate W. B. Yeats (1865–1939)—incorporated Decadent themesinto their work.31 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts031][images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_009_r1.jpg]Herbert Charles Jerome Pollitt (1872–1942), in and out of stage costume. (photocredit 2.2) [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c02-fig002a]Pollitt was not only a close friend but also a patron of Decadent artist AubreyBeardsley (1872–1898), collecting many of his originals, including drawings fromLysistrata (1896). Beardsley, meanwhile, designed a bookplate for his friendPollitt. It is probably through Pollitt that Crowley met the ailing Beardsleyand commissioned a bookplate from him;32[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts032] he also asked Beardsley toprovide a cover illustration for one of his books, for that December the artistwrote to Pollitt, “Your Cambridge bard must indeed be decorated and issued fromthe Arcade. I will protect him with the finest cover.”33[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts033] Alas, Beardsley died in January1898, before he could finish either commission. (Coincidentally, Beardsley’sfather had worked for Crowley’s ales as personal assistant to Edward Crowley upuntil the time the business was sold in 1877.)34[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts034] Pollitt and Beardsley had amutual friend in Leonard Charles Smithers (1861–1907), publisher of Beardsleyand Oscar Wilde; from him Pollitt sometimes purchased items for his sizablecollection. According to Low, Pollittalways bought three copies of his favourites. Two of these would have thebookplates designed for him by Beardsley, one of these he would read, and theother keep mint. The third copy was to lend and give away, as Pollitt was surehe would have to.35 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts035]Beardsley, on his deathbed, sent an urgent message to Smithers, “I implore youto destroy all copies of Lysistrata and bad drawings. Show this to Pollitt andconjure him to do the same. By all that is holy all obscene drawings.”36[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts036] Being collectors, neitherSmithers nor Pollitt complied.Pollitt was also a collector and patron of American expatriate artist JamesMcNeil Whistler (1834–1903). Around September 1896, and again in July throughSeptember 1897, he sat for sketches and portraits by Whistler; although“splendidly begun,” the portrait was ultimately destroyed. However, copies oftwo lithographic sketches survive.37[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts037]Edward F. Benson’s 1897 novel The Babe B.A. paid tribute to Pollitt’s Cambridgecelebrity by modeling its title character after him:The Babe was a cynical old gentleman of twenty years of age, who played thebanjo charmingly. In his less genial moments he spoke querulously of themonotony of the services of the Church of England, and of the hopelessrespectability of M. Zola. His particular forte was dinner parties for six,skirt dancing and acting, and the performances of the duties of halfback atRugby football. His dinner parties were selected with the utmost carelessness,his usual plan being to ask the first five people he met, provided he did notknow them too intimately. With a wig of fair hair, hardly any rouge, and aningénue dress, he was the image of Vesta Collins, and that graceful young ladymight have practised before him, as before a mirror …The furniture of his rooms was as various and as diverse as his accomplishments.Several of Mr. Aubrey Beardsley’s illustrations from the Yellow Book, clusteringround a large photograph of Botticelli’s Primavera, which the Babe had neverseen, hung above one of the broken sofas, and in his bookcase several numbers ofthe Yellow Book, which the Babe declared bitterly had turned grey in a singlenight, since the former artist had ceased to draw for it, were ranged side byside with Butler’s Analogies, Mr. Sponge’s Sporting Tour, and Miss MarieCorelli’s Barabbas.38 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts038]On the book’s publication in early 1897, Beardsley wrote excitedly, “Have youseen Dodo Benson’s new novel? It contains three immortal references to yourhumble servant. There will be a statue yet.”39[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts039]Crowley met Pollitt at Cambridge in October 1897, in the midst of his trance ofsorrow. Jerome lived in a Kendal, Westmoreland, house called the Green Window,and had returned to his alma mater to dance again for the Footlights DramaticClub. Offstage he wore a plain and tragic face: his most striking features wereafflicted lips and starved eyes, framed by a pale golden mane; but, onstage, heresembled “one of Rossetti’s women brought to life.”40[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts040] Crowley thought he wasbeautiful.Jerome, who was twenty-six to Crowley’s twenty-two, soon became the firstintimate friend in AC’s sheltered life. They saw each other daily, enjoying, asCrowley put it, “that ideal intimacy which the Greeks considered the greatestglory of manhood.”41 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts041] Hispersonal copy of the book clarifies the thinly veiled metaphor with thehandwritten note, “I lived with Pollitt as his wife for some six months and hemade a poet out of me.”AC was certainly no stranger to the notion of homosexuality: his father hadwarned him against it upon his introduction to boarding school; he had beenaccused of it at Champney’s school for Plymouth brethren; a Plymouth tutor hadattempted to seduce him; and Malvern housed among its star athletes a host ofsodomites. But there was something different about Pollitt. Jerome was anartist, an educated man, someone he respected and learned from. And Cambridgerepresented unlocked doors, boundless horizons, and open minds. Although Crowleywas a passionate artist, his upbringing left him tremendously naive. Hedoubtlessly proved to be an easy, if not willing, conquest.Christmas vacation 1897 found Crowley in Amsterdam, the spiritual emptiness andhunger he began experiencing just two months before now at its peak. He wasrestless, sleepless. On December 23, having walked the streets all day, hewatched the sun set by the docks, cradling in his hands his crucifix, ponderingthe martyred God, and finding no comfort therein.I contemplate the woundStabbed in the flanks of my dear silver Christ.He hangs in anguish there; the crown of thornsPierces that palest brow; the nails drip blood;There is the wound; no Mary by Him mourns,There is no John beside the cruel wood;I am alone to kiss the silver lips;I rend my clothing for the temple veil;My heart’s black night must act the sun’s eclipse;My groans must play the earthquake, till I quailAt my own dark imagining; and nowThe wind is bitter; the air breeds snow;I put my Christ away.42 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts042]He was having a crisis of faith, seeking spiritual truths but afraid ofreleasing the sacred creed of his upbringing. So he struggled with reverence anddisillusionment, writing two days later a cynical account of “The Nativity.”43[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts043]Turning his back on the God and Jesus of his upbringing, the only alternative heknew was the devil himself. Thus in March 1898, Crowley visited a Deighton Bellbookshop and purchased a likely sounding reference: A. E. Waite’s (1857–1942)The Book of Black Magic and of Pacts (1898). The book, he soon discovered, wasno Satanic primer, but a sensationally titled anthology of medieval books onmagic. The text described a spiritual alternative hitherto unknown to thesheltered poet. Moreover, Waite’s introduction was riveting; salted throughoutwere pieces of a larger picture:There stood the source of such authority, the school or schools that issued, soto speak, the certificates of title which the records of the expounding masterare supposed to shew that he possessed … That there was, as there still is, ascience of the old sanctuaries.44[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts044]The idea was anything but clear, but he caught the gist: there existed a schoolof mystic knowledge that throughout the ages instructed seekers after spiritualtruth. He sent a letter to the author requesting more information.Waite’s kind reply came in April, urging Crowley to prayer and purity. He alsoencouraged him to read German mystic Karl von Eckartshausen (1752–1813), whoseDer Wolke vor dem Heiligthume (1802) had recently been translated as The Cloudupon the Sanctuary (1896). Although Crowley always seemed to have a disparagingword or twenty about Waite’s occult scholarship,45[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts045] he admitted Waite’s impact uponhis own life at this juncture:Waite certainly did start a revival of interest in Alchemy, Magic, Mysticism,and all the rest. That his scholarship was so contemptible, his style sooverloaded, and his egomania so outrageous does not kill to the point ofextinction the worth of his contribution. If it had not been for Waite, I doubtif, humanly speaking, I should ever have got in touch with the Great Order. Youmay of course, if you like, go one step further, back to Anna Kingsford andEdward Maitland,46 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts046] but theirwork, superior as it is to him, lacked one great asset. They gave us no idea ofthe bulk of medieval literature. To go back further still, H. P. B.,47[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts047] genius as she was, was far too“oriental” to produce the necessary effect. Waite occupies a position not unlikethat of Samuel Johnson. There is an omnivalence about him, which did just whatwas necessary at the time.48 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts048]Crowley took the man’s advice and purchased a copy of the book to read duringEaster vacation.That holiday at Wastdale Head with Pollitt was clumsy and awkward. Although theywalked the fells together, they spent much of their time apart. Pollitt refusedto join AC in any climbing, and Crowley spent the rest of his spare timereading. Although he admired Crowley’s mind, Pollitt feared that his spiritualpursuits would drive them apart. As Crowley recalled, Jerome “fought mostdesperately against my increasing preoccupation with the aspiration in which herecognized the executioner of our friendship.”49[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts049]That hangman was Eckartshausen’s book. Written in the form of six letters, TheCloud upon the Sanctuary spelled out the existence of the mystic academy thatWaite had hinted at. Toward the end of the first letter, AC read:A more advanced school has always existed to which the deposition of all sciencehas been confided, and this school was the community illuminated interiorly bythe Saviour, the Society of the Elect, which has continued from the first day ofcreation to the present time; its members, it is true, are scattered all overthe world, but they have always been united by one spirit and one truth.The second letter was more explicit:This community possesses a School, in which all who thirst for knowledge areinstructed by the Spirit of Wisdom itself; and all the mysteries of God and ofnature are preserved therein for the children of light.50[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts050]In this school, knowledge was presented dressed in symbol and ceremony, so thestudent learned spiritual truths by degrees. It was exactly what he wanted. Buthow to find it? Crowley took the only tack he could imagine: he prayed andpetitioned to God and the masters to lead him to the Sanctuary. As if on cue, hemet Oscar Eckenstein (1859–1921)—a skilled mountaineer seventeen years olderthan Crowley—who would unwittingly set him on the right path.Oscar Johannes Ludwig Eckenstein was born in Canonbury, Islington, on September9, 1859, to the German Jewish refugee Frederick Gottlieb Eckenstein (c.1821–1891) and his wife Julie Amalie Antonia Helmke (born c. 1831).51[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts051] Frederick fled Bonn in 1848 toavoid prosecution for his socialist activities,52[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts052] and in London he started thefirm Kumpf & Eckenstein, exporting seeds, grain, oil paints, turpentine, andmachinery to continental European cities like Antwerp, Paris, Bordeaux, andHamburg.53 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts053] Oscar was the sixthof seven children,54 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts054] attendingUniversity College School and studying chemistry in both London and Bonn.Although he worked as a chemist, Eckenstein is better known as a civil engineerwith the International Railway Congress Association.55[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts055] According to H. W. Hillhouse, hewas “years ahead of the times in thought and scientific invention of devices forthe betterment of railroading.”56[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts056] Crowley’s Confessions recountseveral of Eckenstein’s professional anecdotes.57[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts057] His line of work indeed gaveEckenstein something in common with Crowley’s uncle Jonathan, but it was hisskill as a mountaineer that first impressed Aleister.Below the Pen Y Pass youth hostel in North Wales sits the Eckenstein Boulder. Asa new climber, Oscar Eckenstein applied his engineering skills and fascinationwith arithmetic puzzles to this modest-sized object, and in doing so hepioneered the hold and balance techniques that would later revolutionize thesport of climbing. Although he scaled his first mountain in 1872, his firstAlpine climbs aren’t recorded until 1886.58[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts058] He evidently made up for losttime, and in 1887 made numerous first ascents with various climbers, includingthe famous Alpine guide Matthias Zurbriggen (1856–1917). Many of these peaks aredocumented in The Alpine Portfolio, an album of one hundred heliotypephotographs of the Swiss Alps edited by Eckenstein and August Lorria.59[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts059] Around this time he also beganthe first of several first ascents of Y Lliwedd (2,946 feet) in North Wales.By most accounts, Eckenstein met art historian and mountaineer William MartinConway (1856–1937) while climbing at Zermatt in 1891. However, Oscar’s sisterLina—a feminist polymath and budding cultural historian in her own right—hadalready been working for Conway as a transcriber and translator on The LiteraryRemains of Albrecht Dürer,60 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts060] andthis connection may well have played a role in the climbers’ meeting. Conwayinvited Eckenstein to join his 1892 expedition to the Karakorams, which wasbeing subsidized by the Royal Geographical Society and the Royal Society.61[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts061] Their mutual acquaintanceZurbriggen was also part of the team, and Eckenstein gladly accepted. Alas,Oscar wound up leaving the expedition early and returning to London. Conwayconsistently reported that Eckenstein was forced to leave the expedition due toill health.62 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts062] However,Eckenstein’s account in The Karakorams and Kashmir: An Account of a Journey(1896) reveals there had been tensions between the conservative Conway and theunorthodox Eckenstein. Ultimately, Eckenstein felt that they spent too much timereconnoitering and not enough climbing in their two and a half months among themountains, and in a meeting with Conway it was decided that he should leave theexpedition.63 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts063] A tacitcompetition brewed after that, with Conway knighted in 1895 while Eckensteinremained in relative obscurity.Those who knew Eckenstein agreed that he was “cultured but eccentric,” anopinionated and sometimes didactic individual with no interest in conforming toconvention.64 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts064] It was the at rootof his conflict with Conway. It was the reason he, like Crowley, disdained theAlpine Club, which he perceived as staid and conventional. It was even clearfrom his dress: he preferred his full beard, straw sandals, and old fisherman’shat to well-appointed clothes, leading more than one acquaintance to themistaken conclusion that he was poor.One characteristic of Eckenstein that would prove very influential on Crowleywas his love of the works of Sir Richard Francis Burton (1821–1890). Accordingto Guy Knowles (1879–1959), Eckenstein—with whom he climbed the Weisshorn(14,780 feet), Lyskamm (14,852 feet), Dent Blanche (14,291 feet), and Matterhorn(14,692 feet) in 1898—was an avid collector of Burtonania, buying it whenever hecame across any.65 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts065] Indeed,Eckenstein’s collection of Burton documents and first editions (including rarevariants of the first editions) was so significant that N. M. Penzer relied uponit when compiling his Burton bibliography; it was posthumously donated to theRoyal Asiatic Society’s Burton memorial in 1939 by Lewis C. Lloyd and wasreferenced for the first time by a Burton biographer in Godsall’s The TangledWeb.66 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts066] Dean considers itunlikely that the men ever met, pointing out that “Burton died in 1890, agedsixty-nine, when Eckenstein was 31; and during the previous eighteen yearsBurton had been consul at Treiste.”67[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts067] Nevertheless, Hillhouse assertsthat his friend had indeed met Burton:O. E. often spoke of him [Sir Richard Burton] to me, in our talks about thephilosophies of India and the East, and I do know that it was O. E.’s andBurton’s intense interest in Eastern philosophies, especially mental telepathy,which brought them together at one time.68[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts068]This statement is doubly significant: First, it indicates that Eckenstein wasthe second mountain-climbing chemist with mystical tendencies to cross Crowley’spath. Second, Crowley was also a great admirer of Burton, who would inspireCrowley’s subsequent adventures in the middle and far east, as well as his bookThe Scented Garden (1910). In later years, Crowley would recommend Burton’s TheBook of the Thousand Nights and a Night and Kasidah to students in Magick inTheory and Practice (1929), and even canonize Burton as a saint in his GnosticMass (1918). Crowley’s Confessions don’t reveal how he first discovered Burton,but it may have been through Eckenstein … much as Crowley’s classmate H. A.Adamson introduced him to Shelley. Regardless, Crowley certainly equated the twomen: Burton and Eckenstein were two of the “Three Immortal Memories” to whom hededicated his Confessions, and within its pages he would say, “Sir RichardBurton was my hero and Eckenstein his modern representative.”69[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts069][images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_010_r1.jpg]A 1894 portrait of Oscar Eckenstein (1859–1921) by Alphonse Legros. (photocredit 2.3) [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c02-fig003a]Eckenstein’s neat, logical, and tactical approach to climbing provided theperfect foil for skilled but undisciplined AC. Short and stocky, Eckenstein wasa complete athlete with seemingly limitless stamina and an uncanny sense ofdirection. His right arm was so strong that he could grab a ledge and pullhimself up with just a few fingers. As Crowley later reported to hill-climberand writer Joseph Henry Doughty (1889–1936), “Eckenstein, provided he could get3 fingers on something that could be described as a ledge by a man far advancedin hashish, would be smoking his pipe on the aforesaid ledge a few seconds laterand none of us could tell how he had done it.”70[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts070] Also enamored of puzzles,Eckenstein quickly solved climbing conundrums with great success.Together they climbed Wastdale Head, discussing mountaineering, the Alpine Club,and the lack of a true challenge. Eckenstein was determined to return to theHimalayas and conquer the Baltoro Glacier; to succeed where Conway failed.Crowley eagerly bought into the plan, agreeing to tackle the Himalayas some day,but only after sufficient training.During these animated encounters on Wastdale Head, Crowley saw a rift openbetween Pollitt and himself like that in the Devil’s Chimney. Not only did theyseem to share little in common, but Pollitt proved an impediment to hisspiritual quest. Thus, when Crowley began composing “Jezebel”71[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts071] during the vacation, he snuckoff to Maidenhead to be alone to write. When Pollitt finally tracked him down,the poet at work was angry and resentful. “I have given my life to religion,”Crowley told him, “and you don’t fit into the scheme.”Regret sank in soon afterward. Crowley realized his error and weakness, anddrafted a letter of apology that he couldn’t bring himself to send. Thus theyparted on those terms, speaking only occasionally thereafter until, one day,they passed each other on Bond Street; Crowley didn’t notice, while Pollitt tookit as a personal slight and never spoke to him again.Crowley carried bittersweet memories of Pollitt for many years, leavingscattered literary remnants as testimony to their friendship. The dedication ofCrowley’s first book, which was in press about this time, refers to Pollitt ashis “Lover and Lord.”72 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts072] Later,he wrote two scathing sonnets on Pollitt, published in his Works of AleisterCrowley with the apologia:The virulence of these sonnets is excusable when it is known that their aim wasto destroy the influence in Cambridge of a man who headed in that University amovement parallel to that which at Oxford was associated with the name of OscarWilde. They had their effect.73 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts073]Over a decade later, he published The Scented Garden (1910), a parody of SirRichard Burton’s essays on Middle Eastern sexuality. References to homosexualityoccur throughout, while Chapter XLI, “The Riddle,” teases the reader:Habib hath heard; let all Iranwho spell aright from A to ZExalt thy fame and understandwith whom I made a marriage-bed …The solution to the riddle is easy enough: the first letter of each line spellsout the name of Herbert Charles Jerome Pollitt. Lest there be any uncertainty,the next poem, Chapter XLII’s “Bagh-i-Muattar,” contains an acrostic spellingAleister Crowley in reverse. The tender feelings survived four years later,when, arriving in America in 1914, he wished in his diary for a companion likePollitt.74 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts074] In “Not the Life andAdventures of Sir Roger Bloxham,” written three years later in 1917, thecharacter Hippolytus is H. Pollitt, while Sir Roger Bloxham is Crowleyhimself.75 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts075] Finally, in hisConfessions, he recalls his break with Pollitt with the words, “It has been mylifelong regret, for a nobler and purer comradeship never existed on thisearth.”76 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts076]Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repentedhimself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests andelders, saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. Andthey said, What is that to us? see thou to that. And he cast down the pieces ofsilver in the temple, and departed and went and hanged himself. And the chiefpriests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them intothe treasury, because it is the price of blood. And they took counsel, andbought with them the potter’s field to bury strangers in. Wherefore that fieldwas called, The field of blood, unto this day.—Matthew 27:3–8The soil of Potter’s Field in Jerusalem, according to tradition, could consume acorpse in twenty-four hours. Its Hebrew name, Aceldama, means “field of blood.”In 1218 boatloads of its soil were shipped to the Campo Santo in Pisa. In 1898it became the title of Crowley’s first book.Aceldama: A Place to Bury Strangers In was a poem in thirty-two stanzas brimmingwith passion and ranging from the erotic to the divine. It reveals the author’sdelirious struggle with base emotions and the trance of sorrow while strivingfor a glimpse of his guru upon the spiritual pinnacle:This was a dream—and how may I attain?How make myself a worthy acolyte?How from my body shall my soul take flight,Being constrained in this devouring chainOf selfishness? How purge the spirit quiteOf gross desiresThat eat into the heart with their corrupting fires?Old Buddha gave command; Jehovah spake;Strange distant gods that are not dead todayAdded their voices; Heaven’s desart wayMan wins not but by sorrow …77 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts077]The book appeared in an edition of one hundred copies. Of these, two were onoutsize vellum, ten on Japanese vellum, and eighty-eight on handmade paper.Copies sold for half a crown. Because of its small print run, and because copiesdid not go out for review, his debut garnered little press reaction. One rarereviewer wrote apprehensively:Induced by we know not what course of reading, the book is not one that can berecommended to the young, for though its stanzas are sufficiently musical, thereruns through them a vein of scepticism and licentiousness which requires to betreated with caution.78 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts078]Crowley, of course, assessed the book more generously. “I attained, at a bound,the summit of my Parnassus. In a sense, I have never written anything better.”79[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts079] College influences are readilyapparent in Aceldama. The author of the book is given as “a gentleman of theUniversity of Cambridge” in homage to Shelley, who published his St. Irvyne; orthe Rosicrucian: A Romance (1811) as “a gentleman of the University of Oxford.”The book’s flowing, lyric style is likewise modeled after Shelley. Pollitt’sinfluence is visible not only in the dedication to his “Lover and Lord,” butalso in the introduction, which smacks of the Decadent literature to whichPollitt had introduced him:It was a windy night, that memorable seventh night of December, when thisphilosophy was born in me. How the grave old Professor wondered at my ravings! Ihad called at his house, for he was a valued friend of mine, and I felt strangethoughts and emotions shake within me. Ah! how I raved! I called to him totrample me, he would not. We passed together into the stormy night. I was onhorseback, how I galloped round him in my phrenzy, till he became the prey of areal physical fear! How I shrieked out I know not what strange words! And thepoor good old man tried all he could to calm me; he thought I was mad! The fool!I was in the death struggle with self: God and Satan fought for my soul thosethree long hours. God conquered—now I have only one doubt left—which of thetwain was God? Howbeit, I aspire!Although to conclude from this dramatic account that Crowley was a Satanistwould be missing the point entirely, the passage does reflect his inner conflictover religion, just as the poem itself describes his aspiration forenlightenment. Crowley’s Decadent mindset is evident when one considers that heinscribed one of the two outsized vellum copies to Beardsley.80[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts080] Alas, the artist died before ACcould present it. Another copy of the book he inscribed to his publisher: “ToLeonard Smithers from Aleister Crowley hys fyrst booke.”81[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts081]Smithers, as mentioned earlier, was a friend of Pollitt and Beardsley. Hepossessed an incongruous mixture of admirable and repugnant traits. Learned andgenerous, vulgar and irresponsible, he drank brandy excessively—although hefavored absinthe—and was notoriously unfaithful to his wife. Oscar Wilde wroteof him, “He loves first editions, especially of women: little girls are hispassion. He is the most learned erotomaniac in Europe. He is also a delightfulcompanion and a dear fellow.”82 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts082]He was a lawyer who, in 1891 or 1892, entered into a bookselling and publishingpartnership, issuing some of the most beautiful books ever produced. Admirerscalled Smithers the cleverest publisher in London. He supplemented his incomewith erotic literature such as Teleny, or, The Reverse of the Medal (1893).83[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts083] In 1894 he started his ownsuccessful book business, offering titles such as Sir Richard Burton’s TheCarmina of Caius Valerius Catullus (1894), Ernest Dowson’s Verses (1896),Alexander Pope’s Rape of the Lock (1896), Arthur Symons’s Amoris Victima (1897),and Ben Jonson’s Volpone (1898).Crowley first met him in 1897 as part of Pollitt’s Decadent circle. Althoughfinely crafted books no longer sold well—nor did clandestinely publishederotica—Smithers remained committed to publishing fine editions despitefinancial hardship. He published Beardsley’s Book of Fifty Drawings (1897), ASecond Book of Fifty Drawings (1899), and the periodical The Savoy (1898). AfterOscar Wilde’s trial, he was the only publisher willing to handle Wilde’s lastthree books: The Ballad of Reading Gaol (1898), An Ideal Husband (1899), and TheImportance of Being Earnest (1899).“I’ll publish anything the others are afraid of,” he bragged to Crowley, whotook the statement as an invitation. Smithers had already taught him howpublishing deluxe editions can bolster a book’s collectability; given him anappreciation for Japanese vellum as book stock; and introduced him to eroticawith a copy of Teleny. Crowley regarded the publisher, his pale face framed by astraw hat on one end and a blue tie on the other, and determined to produce abook for Smithers to publish. Whence Aceldamaworks.Portrait artist and Royal Academy President Sir Gerald Festus Kelly (1879–1972)was just another Cambridge student when Aceldama appeared. He purchased it at aspecialty bookshop that carried the book as a courtesy because Crowley spent somuch money there on first editions. The book, particularly its quotation fromSwinburne’s “The Leper,” fascinated Kelly. He wished to meet the mysterious“gentleman of the University of Cambridge,” so the bookseller arranged it.Their meeting in May 1898 went wonderfully. They discovered many commonexperiences: Both had suffered debilitating childhood illnesses. Both came fromaffluent families. Both were reacting against clerical fathers. Both identifiedwith their Irish ancestry. And both were passionate artists.Gerald Kelly was the grandchild of Frederic Festus Kelly, His Majesty’sInspector of Inland Letter Carriers who, in 1835, began publishing Kelly’sDirectories, which were essentially the Victorian version of the yellow pages.Gerald was the third child and only son of the Reverend Frederic Festus Kelly(1838–1918), Vicar of Camberwell, and his wife, Blanche Bradford (born c. 1845).He had two older sisters, Rose Edith (1874–1932) and Eleanor Constance Mary(born 1877). Gerald enjoyed the benefits of affluence, and in 1896, at ageseventeen, sailed with Rose for South Africa to recuperate from a liver abscess.Macey, his cabinmate, praised Gerald’s early watercolors and urged him to studypainting in Paris. Although he and Macey saw each other only occasionally afterthey arrived in Cape Town, the notion of becoming a painter consumed the youngman.When he eventually returned home with a clean bill of health, Gerald announcedhis intention to become a painter. “Rot” his father said. “No member of myfamily ever showed the slightest talent.” Mrs. Kelly, who adored Gerald,defended his decision, and after six months’ argument they reached an agreement:if Gerald went to Cambridge as his father had,84[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts084] then Reverend Kelly would allowhim to become a painter.In 1897, Gerald matriculated to Trinity Hall. He had no intention of following aregular course of study; he was simply there to pass time and enjoy himself.Thomas Thornely (1855–1949), lecturer in moral and historical sciences, wasdisappointed to find the Kelly heir uninterested in history, but did his best toexpose the lad to poetry. Gerald would spend the next three years reading poetryin a desultory manner, leading eventually to Crowley. Four years younger thanCrowley, Kelly saw a worldly and charming role model in the poet, and theyimmediately became close friends. Reflecting on this time more than fifty yearslater, Kelly mused, “Aleister and I were great friends for several years,” and“I liked him; we made each other laugh … he was certainly a delightfulcompanion.”85 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts085]Smithers was the logical publisher for Crowley’s next book, White Stains (1898).Although tame by today’s standards, some of its pieces—such as “A Ballad ofPassive Paederasty,” “With Dog and Dame,” and “Necrophilia”—required theseasoned hands of an underground publisher. Because of its content, Smitherssent the book to Amsterdam to be typeset by Binger Bros. Crowley published itanonymously, and as with Aceldama, only one hundred copies were printed.The book, with the descriptive subtitle “The literary remains of GeorgeArchibald Bishop, a neuropath of the Second Empire,” was a reaction to Austrianpolice doctor Richard Freiherr von Krafft-Ebing’s (1840–1902) study of sexualaberrations, Psychopathia Sexualis (1893): the book that coined the termmasochism after the fiction of fellow Austrian Leopold Ritter von Sacher-Masoch(1836-1895). Although Krafft-Ebing translated the racier sections of his textinto Latin, the book became a sensation among erudite pornographers everywhere.Crowley, determined to do a better job of explaining the nature of sexualdeviance, wrote a story from the perspective of a poet who goes astray, takingon various vices and ultimately committing murder. Crowley later clarified, “Thework is entirely one of imagination, as he had no actual experience, even byhearsay, of the subject on which he was writing.”86[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts086]Although White Stains has been hastily dubbed pornographic, it actually belongsto Decadent literature, with poetry a natural style for Crowley to choose.Swinburne’s Decadent poem “Tannhauser” impressed him so much that he would laterre-tell the tale in his own book of the same title. And Reed’s description ofDecadence, although applied to Flaubert’s The Temptation of Saint Anthony, alsoapplies to White Stains:a sequence of set pieces rendered in a complicated and ornate self-advertisingstyle. The segments of the work are detachable, yet when read in sequence theycreate an anticipatory mood like that of musical composition.87[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts087]Other Decadent themes incorporated into White Stains include the pursuit ofpleasure, irreverence toward religion, and repugnant subject matter.Crowley’s third manuscript, Green Alps, was next in Smithers’s hands. Itcontained “Two Sonnets in Praise of a Publisher”: two poems for Smithers withlittle praise and much shocking imagery. This collection of poetry neverappeared. A fire at the printers destroyed the sheets and Smithers went bankruptshortly thereafter. Proofs of the dedication and pages 81–107 are known to havesurvived, although Crowley published some of these poems later.88[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts088]With Smithers defunct, Pollitt out of the picture, Beardsley dead, and Crowleyat the end of his senior year, it was time to move on. Just as the diplomaticservice, like all other mortal aspirations, was an exercise in futility, so wasa Cambridge degree. It was merely window dressing for one’s pride. Although hehad successfully completed his coursework and exams up to this point, Crowleynever appeared for the second part of his finals. He felt he had mastered thesubjects, and that was good enough for him. In the tradition of Byron, Shelley,Swinburne, and Tennyson, he left the university without a degree and pursued hisown star.The entire month of July 1898 passed camped in a tent above the Alpine snow lineat 11,500 feet, below the Dent Blanche (14,291 feet) and beside the SchönbühlGlacier.89 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts089] Crowley was trainingwith Eckenstein in techniques necessary to attempt the Himalayas. “You neverknow when you’ll have to jump in an emergency,” Eckenstein instructed, and, byway of preparation, Eckenstein ran his student through grueling training. Earlyon, he made Crowley slide headfirst down a snowy incline, with instructions todo nothing to stop himself until given the word; then he had to the count offive to stop and end up standing. From there, the training became increasinglydifficult and dangerous, with glissades from various positions and slopes.90[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts090]He also taught Crowley how to use crampons, or ice claws. Eckenstein attemptedto introduce them to British mountaineers, insisting that they made cuttingsteps with ice axes unnecessary; but English and Scottish climbers panned themfor years as “artificial aids” before finally accepting them. In 1908 he wouldinvent a hinged ten-point crampon that would become commercially available in1910, known today as the Eckenstein crampon. Another of Eckenstein’s laterinnovations was to turn the typical ice ax, or alpenstock, into a one-handedimplement by shortening it by five inches and making the head smaller; whilepoorly received in England, it proved to be most effective in combination withhis crampon designs. Both were offered by A. Hupfauf of Einsiedeln,Switzerland.91 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts091]The indifference of the climbing establishment to Eckenstein’s innovationstypified his clash with the Alpine Club. To him, the club was merely a means formediocre climbers to congratulate themselves for lame achievements. LikeCrowley, he found their Alpine guides useless and their recommended routeshardly more than a scramble. When the Club condemned their guideless ascents asreckless, AC accused the Club of “virulent, dishonest, envious intrigues againstguideless climbing and climbers.”92[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts092] Eckenstein, meanwhile, jokedsardonically that he could take a cow up the Matterhorn if he tied its legs. Hewrote in his “Hints to Young Climbers,”The aspirant is confronted by real trouble—that is, if he really wishes tobecome good; for he is compassed about with a great cloud of witnesses—“expertwitnesses”—who are all quite, or nearly quite, as ignorant of mountain craft asthe veriest beginner, and are Great Authorities on Climbing and Mountaineering.Climbing is, as far as I know, the only sport in which the absolute humbug canreign supreme without instant exposure.…Believe nothing that is told you about mountain craft, unless you have absoluteproof that a real expert is speaking. If a soi-disant “Authority” tells you thatno man can walk up an ice slope of 60 degrees without cutting steps; that no onecan see a crevasse when it is covered with snow; that guides are vastly superiorto amateurs; believe him not. Go and try for yourself; if you find you cannot doany of these things, find some one who can, and then take his statements forgospel …How, you will ask, are you to distinguish this sublime person at sight? Thus.Ask him if he uses claws; if he is better than most first-class Swiss guides; ifhe can sit on one leg on a smooth hard ice slope of 70 degrees without a stephaving been cut; if he has led on more than six good guideless expeditions inthe Alps (successful ones!); if he is a better rock-climber than almost anyguide he ever met—he must answer “Yes” to all these queries and be prepared toprovide his words, or he is a beginner in the Art.93[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts093]This article gives a good glimpse of what training with Eckenstein must havebeen like for Crowley. Indeed, this maverick instructor even acknowledged hisprotégé’s unconventional technique: “For example, the outer pinnacle of theDevil’s Chimney at Beachy Head was only climbed with the assistance of adefinite pull from an unshaven chin!”94[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts094]Perhaps what was difficult for the club to bear was that these dissidentclimbers were good. Competent and respected Eckenstein struck out on his own;under his wing was the outspoken and independent Crowley, who, after astonishingeveryone by climbing Beachy Head, proceeded to set other climbing records bothon the Alps and on Britain’s sea cliffs. Arnold Lunn (1888–1974)—British skier,Alpine Club president, and creator of the alpine slalom race—reluctantlyadmitted they were both technically excellent climbers,95[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts095] and mountaineer Thomas GeorgeLongstaff, after a demonstration of the new crampons on August 24, calledCrowleya fine climber, if an unconventional one. I have seen him go up the dangerousand difficult right (true) side of the great icefall of the mer de Glace belowthe Géant alone, just for a promenade. Probably the first and perhaps the onlytime this mad, dangerous and difficult route had been taken.96[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts096]During free moments on the glacier, Crowley studied S. L. MacGregor Mathers’s(1854–1918) The Kabbalah Unveiled (1887), which he had been reading since July.It was a translation of Knorr von Rosenroth’s (d. 1689) Latin tome KabbalaDenudata (1677–1684), itself a translation of that classic of Hebrew mysticliterature, The Zohar. Crowley recognized a wealth of information in the bookbut could not grasp it. For that reason it intrigued him even more. He pinedincreasingly for the teacher he had prayed for at Wastdale. Little did herealize that Eckenstein had brought him to just the right place.In August 1898, Crowley descended the glacier for a much needed break, packingup his book and staying in the village of Zermatt. There, the impetuous studentof mysticism found himself in a beer hall one night discussing alchemy. Havingpassed Cambridge’s special exam in chemistry with a second class, Crowley felthimself quite the expert in present company, and lectured with cocksureness. Hewas wrong. After the discussion, a man introduced himself to Crowley as JulianL. Baker, analytical chemist. Baker recognized a well-read and sincere studentof the mysteries beneath AC’s arrogant exterior and discussed the fine points ofalchemy while escorting Crowley back to his hotel.Science records the name of Julian Levett Baker (1873–1958) as an Englishchemist, educated at the City of London School until a bout of scarlet feverover Easter 1888 prevented his return. His father arranged for academiccoaching, and Baker passed the next entrance exam to Finsbury Technical College,where he studied chemistry for three years (because he was so young at entry,they kept him an extra year beyond the customary two). In 1891, at age nineteen,he became assistant chemist—and later chief chemist—to the London Beetroot SugarAssociation under Arthur Robert Ling (1861–1937), future professor of brewing atBirmingham, with whom he collaborated.97[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts097] In April 1899, Baker wasproposed as a fellow of the Society of Public Analysts;98[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts098] he was also a fellow of theImperial College and of the Chemical Society.99[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts099] In 1900 he became the firstchemist appointed to a London brewery—the Stag Brewery at Pimlico, operated byWatney, Combe, Reid and Co. Ltd.—where he would remain until his retirementforty-six years later.100 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts100]Indeed, he is best known for his contributions to brewing chemistry—aninteresting coincidence given the Crowley family’s roots. Baker became honorarysecretary of the London section of the Society of Chemical Industry in 1905,where his responsibilities included the program of its ambitious annualmeetings.101 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts101] As a foundingmember of the Institute of Brewing, he also authored The Brewing Industry(1905), followed by his chapter on “Malt and Malt Liquors” in Allen’s CommercialOrganic Analysis (1909), and the article on “Fermentation” in EncyclopædiaBritannica (1911).102 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts102] He quicklyestablished a reputation as “one of the foremost English exponents of brewingchemistry.… In him are combined two attributes which are seldom found together,namely a finely trained and rigidly scientific mind with practical knowledge andaction.”103 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts103]Baker would author some fifty papers over his career. He would also serve hisprofession as honorary secretary of the Institute of Brewing (1908–1918),followed by a forty-year term as its vice president; publication committeemember for the Journal of the Society of Chemical Industry; editor of TheAnalyst (1907–1920) and Journal of the Institute of Brewing (1920–1949); and anexaminer in brewing to both the City and Guilds of London Institute (1908–1911)and the University of Birmingham (1928–1931). On November 6, 1924, he deliveredthe Streatfield Memorial Lecture at his alma mater, the Finsbury TechnicalCollege.104 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts104] Other career honorsincluded his 1944 election to the City and Guilds of London Institute, and his1948 receipt of the Horace Brown medal, the highest award of the Institute ofBrewing.105 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts105] He was well known inthe business; his colleague George Cecil Jones noted that, among a crowd ofchemists, “Baker seems to know everyone here and everyone knows Baker.”106[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts106] Another colleague described him,“His character was essentially his own and he possessed an old world courtesythat was as charming as it was natural.”107[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts107]In 1898, however, Baker was still a chemist with the Beetroot Sugar Association,where he discovered his interest in sugars and starches.108[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts108] Thus Crowley had just met thethird of three climber-chemists with a mystical bent.Crowley sat in his room that night, pondering his luck. Baker was an alchemist,but was he the master he had asked for? If so, how ironic that fatigue andvanity were the devices of his discovery. Kismet, he decided: in the morning, hewould ask Baker if he was a master.By the time Crowley asked after him, however, Baker had already left the hotel.AC frantically telegraphed all over the valley, desperate not to let his onelink to the Sanctuary vanish. After searching the local hotels and railroadstations, he finally found Baker and told him of his search for the SecretSanctuary. Then he asked the big one: “Are you a Master?”Baker smiled and shook his head. “No, but on our return to London, I’llintroduce you to a man who is much more of a magician than I.”His health declined throughout the summer, finally forcing Crowley to leaveEckenstein’s camp and return to London under a physician’s care. He took a roomin the Cecil Hotel during his convalescence, writing the poetic play Jephthahand corresponding with Baker about the Secret Sanctuary.When Baker introduced Crowley to George Cecil Jones (1873–1960) that October,everything fell neatly into place. Jones was an industrial chemist of 58Cliddesden Road, Basingstoke, who, like Baker, was still early in his career.Although Crowley called him Welsh,109[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts109] Jones was actually born inCroydon, Surrey, on January 10, 1873.110[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts110] Educated from 1889 to 1893 atthe City and Guilds of London Central Institute, he worked for eighteen monthsas assistant to the eminent London analytical chemists Messrs. Helbing andPassmore.111 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts111] From there, hetransferred to the Dowson Economic Gas and Power Company, Basingstoke, in late1894. At that time, he was also balloted and elected to the Chemical Society,and in 1896 became a member of the Society of Chemical Industry.112[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts112] In 1896 the Chemical News andJournal of Industrial Science listed him as one of eighteen alumni of the Cityand Guilds of London Institute “whose subsequent careers merit notice.”113[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts113]In the years after meeting Crowley, Jones would work as managing chemist atFree, Rodwell & Co. Ltd.—maltsters of Misty, Essex—from 1902, then five yearslater start his own consulting practice, which he would run until his 1939retirement. Other professional accomplishments include passing the Associate ofthe Institute of Chemistry’s branch “A” examination in mineral chemistry;serving on the London committee of the Society of Chemical Industry (for whichBaker was secretary); nomination to the Society of Public Analysts and OtherAnalytical Chemists; and being an abstractor for The Analyst and an auditor forthe Chemical Technology Examination Board.114[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts114] Over his career he authored anumber of papers and reviews in trade journals like The Analyst and the Journalof the Institute of Brewing and Distilling.115[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts115] Along with Baker, he contributedto Allen’s Commercial Organic Analysis (1909), with chapters on “Alcohols,”“Wines and Potable Spirits,” and “Non-Glucosidal Bitter principles.”116[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts116] He also reported on the state of“Analytical Chemistry” in 1915.117[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts117]Jones was known for his gentle, tolerant, and self-effacing character, his soundjudgement, and moral courage.118 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts118]Slight and lean, with long hair, beard, and mustache, he looked like Jesusincarnate. “I am not an appreciator of poetry,” he told Crowley, “and I have noKeats”;119 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts119] but he was well readin magic, which he investigated empirically. Most medieval books on the subject,he explained, were purposely unintelligible to prevent the profane frompenetrating their secrets. Only a proper instructor could decipher theirmeaning.Once a student was ready, Jones continued, he could contact a teacher in themanner described in the medieval book The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelinthe Mage; the process involved a six-month retirement from the cares of dailyliving, spent instead in constant prayer and meditation unto one’s holy guardianangel. Jones tipped Crowley to a modern translation and interpretation of thebook that had just been published that February; the translator, coincidentally,was Samuel Liddell Mathers. AC instantly recognized this as the translator andexpositor of that other mysterious and impenetrable tome, The Kabbalah Unveiled,and resolved to find a copy. Jones, like Baker, recognized Crowley’s vastmagical potential and offered to introduce him to a body of initiates that couldprepare him for the sacred magic of Abramelin.In response, Crowley secretly took a flat at 67 and 69 Chancery Lane under theidentity of Count Vladimir Svareff. His reasons for adopting this outlandishpseudonym were twofold, as he explains:1) I had resolved to perform the operation of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin theMage. In that book, the aspirant is warned that his family will oppose hisactions and seek to interfere. The assumption of this name was one of myprecautions against any such nonsense.2) I had just come back from Russia, where I had been to learn the language forthe Diplomatic Service, and I thought it would be fun to observe the reactionsof Londoners to a foreign nobleman. It was.120[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts120]Despite advice to wait, he dedicated two rooms to the sacred magic.Meanwhile, Baker and Jones taught Crowley the technique of astral projection.The practice resembles a controlled out-of-body experience, where one’sconsciousness leaves its physical confines and travels in the imagination. Thefirst step involved drawing a protective circle around one’s body,simultaneously preventing other entities from invading it and isolating thepractitioner from ambient distractions. Next, the room was purged of undesirableenergies by means of a formula called the Lesser Banishing Ritual. Prayer ormeditation followed, and finally, projection. All visions were criticallyexamined, tested, and recorded for agreement with known facts about the astralrealm. Unusual as the technique was, it strove for the same systematic andempirical standards that made science possible.Crowley’s first experience was unusually vivid, and his second sight quicklysurpassed Baker’s. In two months’ instruction, Crowley logged a total ofeighteen visions, including attending a performance of Beethoven’s Fifth atQueen’s Hall. The visions, which survive in his diaries and were later partlypublished in The Equinox, are fascinating. One in particular merits description:Traveling down a long gold-purple column that opened into a scarlet cavern, thestudent found his astral body besieged by lost souls attempting to break throughthe protective barrier of his magic circle. Among these, he recognized Pollitt’sface. “Who are these?” Crowley asked.A voice said, “They are the souls of those whom thou hast caused to sin.”Truth or lie, it was an ugly sight. He raised an imaginary sword in outrage, andas he did, a hideous deformed giant lunged out of the shadows and threw itsblack form repeatedly at the circle. To AC’s disbelief, the barrier nearlyyielded, and he prepared to smite the creature. But a voice interrupted andwarned that the monster was his own evil persona, and he ought not to banish it.Although the magician commanded his persona to stop tormenting him, the shadowresponded more furiously than before. The circle yielded dramatically, allowingthe figure perilously close to Crowley, who was confused about how to react.Finally, he raised his magic sword, traced a protective pentagram betweenhimself and his alter ego, and intoned the Tetragrammaton, or sacredfour-lettered name of God: Yahweh. In response the hulk sullenly withdrew.Crowley mournfully considered his dark half, extended his left arm, andinstructed the beast to kiss his hand and repent. However, the wary magicianextended his hand only part way, and the monstrosity bent only slightly towardit. Aleister Crowley’s two sides confronted each other that night and could notmeet halfway. That dark half would resurface over the years, presenting its uglyface at the most inopportune moments, leaving people with a demonic impressionof AC. But for now, the astral traveler returned to his physical body.121[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts121]His quick progress convinced Jones and Baker of both his sincerity and ability.They agreed: it was time Aleister Crowley joined the Order of the Golden Dawn."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREETHE GOLDEN DAWNWilliam Wynn Westcott (1848–1925) was a gentle, friendly man, born in Crowley’shometown of Leamington. His life was like two parallel streams, flowing side byside but never crossing. One river was the medical profession, the other hisspiritual journey. His father, the surgeon Peter Westcott of Oundle, died whenWynn was about ten, and he was subsequently raised by his uncle, Dr. RichardWestcott Martyn of Martock, Somerset. Following in the footsteps of his family,Westcott attended University College, London, passing the University of London’ssecond division MB exam in 1869, and on April 14, 1870, passing his exam atApothecaries’ Hall to receive a certificate to practice medicine.1[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts001] By age twenty-three—four yearsbefore Crowley was born—he became a partner in his uncle’s medical practice inMartock, Somersetshire. Shortly thereafter, he married Eliza Burnett (c.1851–1921), with whom he had five children.2[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts002] Beginning around 1883 he heldthe post of deputy coroner for central Middlesex and central London until he wasappointed coroner of northeast London in 1894.3[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts003] In this capacity, he held overtwenty-one inquests per week into deaths reported in his region4[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts004] until his 1918 retirement. Hisprofessional service included stints as president of the Society for the Studyof Inebriety, vice president of the Medico-Legal Society, vice president of theNational Sunday League, and councillor of the Coroners’ Society. Although hepublished professionally—authoring the book Suicide: Its History, Literature,Jurisprudence, Causation, and Prevention (1885) and the paper “Twelve Years’Experience as a London Coroner” (1907) and coediting fifteen editions of TheExtra Pharmacopoeia from its original 1883 publication5[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts005]—the bulk of his literary outputconcerned the occult.Hermetic philosophy always fascinated Westcott, leading him to study kabbalah,alchemy, and Rosicrucianism. These pursuits led him in 1871—about the time hepartnered with his uncle—to join the Parrett and Axe Masonic Lodge, over whichhe would preside as Worshipful Master in 1877. He also pursued the higher degreerites of Freemasonry, advancing to the Royal Arch and the Rose Croix degrees in1873 and by 1878 reaching the thirtieth degree of the Ancient and AcceptedScottish Rite.6 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts006] On December 2,1886, he was admitted to the prestigious Masonic research lodge, QuatuorCoronati; seven years later, in 1893, he was unanimously elected and installedin a one-year term as its master.7[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts007][images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_011_r1.jpg]Dr. W. Wynn Westcott (1848–1925), cofounder of the Golden Dawn. (photo credit3.1) [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c03-fig001a]Westcott also joined other initiatory organizations, both allied and irregular.On January 7, 1880—just before becoming Deputy Coroner—he joined London’sprestigious Rosicrucian fraternity, Societas Rosicruciana in Anglica (SRIA). Heserved as Supreme Grand Secretary of the Swedenborgian Rite, a hermetic revivalof an earlier fraternal order based on the teachings of Christian mystic EmanuelSwedenborg (1688–1772). And he joined the Esoteric Section of H. P. Blavatsky’s(1831–1891) Theosophical Society (TS). The results of his scholarly researchinto hermeticism took the form of several dozen contributions to Masonicjournals Ars Quatuor Coronatorum and The Freemason, to the Transactions of theMetropolitan College of the SRIA, and to Theosophical journals The Theosophist,Lucifer, and Theosophical Siftings. He also wrote books like Numbers: TheirOccult Power and Mystic Virtue (1890), translated the Sepher Yetzirah (1893) andThe Magical Ritual of the Sanctum Regnum (1896) into English, and cowrote andedited a series of ten monographs issued by the TS as Collectanea Hermetica(1893–1896).8 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts008]In 1887, Westcott discovered in the musty SRIA library an old manuscript writtenin cipher. Decoding its contents, he discovered ritual fragments and the addressof Fräulein Anna Sprengel, a German Rosicrucian adept. Writing her, he wassurprised to receive authorization to start an English branch of the esotericschool known as “Die Goldene Dämmerung,” thus marking the inception of theGolden Dawn (GD), the organization that counted England’s intelligentsia amongstits members. This, at least, is the legend.Whatever the origin of the Cipher Manuscript, the Isis-Urania branch (or,formally, Temple) of the GD was founded in 1888. Like the other societies he hadencountered, the GD espoused no particular religious belief, merely transmittingknowledge gained from comparative study of religion and philosophy the worldover. Westcott invited two SRIA associates—W. R. Woodman and Samuel LiddellMathers—to form the ruling triumvirate.Dr. W. R. Woodman (1828–1891) was a retired physician twenty years Westcott’ssenior. He had also studied kabbalah, Egyptian antiquities, gnosticism,philosophy, astrology, alchemy, and tarot. Having begun as SRIA’s secretary in1867, he advanced in eleven years to the post of supreme magus. Upon his deathin 1891 (three years after founding the GD), Westcott would succeed him asSRIA’s head.Samuel Liddell Mathers (1854–1918) was the most colorful of the GD’s founders.Born in Hackney, he was the son of commercial clerk William M. Mathers. Hisfather died young, and his mother raised him alone at Bournemouth. After herdeath in 1885 he moved to London. As an adult he maintained a firm athleticbuild from boxing and fencing. He also spent countless hours in the BritishMuseum reading room, studying both magic and warfare. He joined the SRIA around1877, where he met both Woodman and Westcott. In 1887—while Westcott wasreputedly deciphering the Cipher Manuscript—he published The Kabbalah Unveiled,a translation of Christian Knorr von Rosenroth’s treatise on the Zohar, KabbalaDenudata (1677–1684), prefaced with his own exposition on the subject. Hededicated the book to Anna Kingsford (1846–1888), past president of the LondonTS and one of the first English women to obtain a degree in medicine; highlyinfluenced by her and her book The Perfect Way (1882), Mathers became a staunchvegetarian and anti-vivisectionist.9[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts009] At the reading room, Mathersmade two friends who would become major players in the GD saga: Mina Bergson andW. B. Yeats.Mina Bergson (1865–1928) was the younger sister of Nobel Prize–winningphilosopher Henri Bergson (1859–1941).10[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts010] A sweet, attractive woman withspringy hair and blue eyes, she was a London art student by age fifteen. She metMathers in 1888 while studying Egyptian art at the British Museum. Themysterious scholar, eleven years her senior, fascinated her, and they wed twoyears later. She called him Zan, after the protagonist in Bulwer-Lytton’s mysticnovel Zanoni (1842). He called her Moïna, his Highland redaction of her name.William Butler Yeats (1865–1939) placed mysticism second in his life only topoetry. By 1887 he had joined Kingsford’s Hermetic Students and, between 1889and 1890, organized the Esoteric Section of the TS. He met Mathers in theBritish Museum reading room around 1889, and came to idolize the man he latercharacterized as having “much learning” but “little scholarship.”11[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts011] Yeats split with theTheosophists because they discouraged the practice of magic; on March 7, 1890,he joined the GD.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_012_r1.jpg]Golden Dawn cofounder Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers (1854–1918) in 1911.(photo credit 3.2) [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c03-fig002a]After losing his job in London and moving to Paris with his wife, Mathers becameincreasingly eccentric. Rekindling his childhood love of Celtic symbology, headopted all its trappings: He claimed descent from the clan MacGregor, the nameof which had been suppressed under penalty of death and in 1603 changed toMathers. He adopted pseudonyms like Comte de Glenstrae, Comte MacGregor, andSamuel Liddell MacGregor; rode his bicycle through the Paris streets in fullHighland dress; and reputedly performed the sword dance with a knife in hisstocking. Back in London, rumor had it Mathers believed himself to be thereincarnation of Scottish wizard king James IV.That same year, Woodman died; with Westcott succeeding him as supreme magus ofthe SRIA, he essentially became a silent partner in the GD. This left Mathers asde facto head of the order, and he seized the opportunity to assert hisdominance, claiming direct contact with the Secret Chiefs—those mysterious anddisembodied masters who ran the order—and managing the London temple from Paris.When high-ranking members tired of answering to an invisible hand, Mathersresponded with a pronunciamento dated October 29, 1896: the Secret Chiefs hadappointed him supreme ruler of the GD; as such, Mathers demanded all memberssign and return to him an oath of loyalty. He would meet all refusals withexpulsion.Ousted in the shakedown was high-ranking member Annie Horniman. The wealthydaughter of a tea merchant, her £200 annual stipend to Mathers was the onlything standing between his obscure translations—such as The Sacred Book ofAbramelin the Mage—and poverty. The expulsion, of course, meant the end of hisallowance. Many of the London temple’s 323 members were outraged by Horniman’ssuspension and assembled a petition to reinstate her. Mathers refused to yield.Coincidentally, matters forced Westcott to further distance himself from the GDat this time. Within days of Mathers’s last visit to London, Westcott’semployers confronted him: someone (in retrospect, presumably Mathers or an ally)had left a GD instructional paper on a carriage with Westcott’s name andbusiness address on it. Learning of Westcott’s outside interests, his superiorstold him, “A coroner should bury bodies, not dig them up.” Westcott gladlypulled back from the order, finding Rosicrucians much easier to deal with thanceremonial magicians.In this agitated political environment, Crowley found himself a Neophyte.A member of that ages-old college of occultism described by Eckartshausen,Perdurabo set out to learn all he could. Upon entering the grade of Neophyte(cryptically denoted 0°=0°, where the first digit represented the grade and thesecond digit the corresponding position on the Hebrew Tree of Life), hediscovered that, like any other school, the GD contained grades through whichstudents passed after examination. Four grades awaited: the Zelator (1°=10°),Theoricus (2°=9°), Practicus (3°=8°), and Philosophus (4°=7°); then he wouldenter the Portal grade to the mysterious Second Order.His first lessons as an occultist gravely disappointed him. They were neithernew nor arcane. His teachers asked him to learn the Hebrew alphabet, the 10spheres or sephiroth of the Hebrew Tree of Life, and the attribution of theseven planets to the seven days of the week. The secrets he swore to keepinviolable were trivia he had already known for months, gleaned from countlessother books of magic. Jones and Baker were supportive, advising him not to judgethe GD until he reached the Second Order.Equally disappointing was the order’s membership. Expecting to encounterspiritual giants, he discovered a group of nonentities. Crowley was not alone inthis opinion. GD member and Irish feminist Maud Gonne (1866–1953) characterizedthe order as “the very essence of British middle-class dullness. They looked soincongruous in their cloaks and badges at initiation ceremonies.”12[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts012] Even Jones called it “a club,like any other club, a place to pass the time and meet one’s friends.”13[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts013] Despite these views, the GDattracted its share of luminaries. Over the years, it claimed among itsmembership authors Arthur Machen (1863–1947) and Algernon Blackwood (1869–1951);the aforementioned poet W. B. Yeats and his uncle George Pollexfen; andConstance Mary Wilde (1859–1898), wife of Oscar Wilde. In addition to thesebetter-known names, the GD also hosted men of learning, including chemists(Baker and Jones), physicians (Westcott, Woodman, Bury, Berridge, Felkin, andothers), and occult scholars (Waite, Mathers, Bennett). In 1898, Dr. Bury eveninvited Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859–1930) to join, but he declined.Despite his protestations, Crowley’s initiation deeply impressed him. He wrotethe poem “The Neophyte”14 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts014] aboutthe experience and, like Yeats, would forever after show its influence in hiswriting and life.Jezebel and Other Tragic Poems (1898)15[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts015] was a twenty-three-page bookletwith a vellum wrapper, privately printed at the Chiswick Press with twelvecopies on vellum and forty on handmade paper. Published under his Russianpseudonym of Vladimir Svareff,16 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts016]it featured an introduction and epilogue by Aleister Crowley and a dedication tohis Cambridge friend Gerald Kelly.While Crowley had an excellent printer in the Chiswick Press, he had no way todistribute and sell his books. Smithers introduced him to the London firm ofKegan Paul, Trench, Trübner and Company, printers and booksellers, and he chosethem to sell his next book, Tale of Archais (1898). Appearing in January 1899,the edition consisted of one hundred copies which sold for five shillingsapiece. One-fourth of the print run was sent out for reviews, which ranged from“a certain command of facile rhythm” to “spurious romanticized mythology.”17[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts017] As early as 1905, Crowleyregretted publishing the piece.18[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts018] Later, Crowley recalled it as“simply jejune; I apologize.”19 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts019]Songs of the Spirit (1898) continued Crowley’s association with Kegan, Paul,Trench, Trübner and Company. Although Crowley contracted this edition aroundDecember 1898, it appeared after Tale of Archais. Finishing at 109 pages, ACdedicated the volume to Julian L. Baker in gratitude for introducing him to theGD. He issued one copy on vellum and fifty signed, besides the print run ofthree hundred. This mixed bag of poems, largely dating from 1897, garnered mixedreviews from the press. While the Manchester Guardian admired its intensespirituality and technical superiority, the Athenaeum considered it to be“difficult to read, and where they touch definite things, more sensual thansensuous.”20 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts020] The Outlook calledCrowley “a poet of fine taste and accomplishment” and his book “contains muchthat is beautiful.”21 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts021] By the endof the year, half the print run had sold.Realizing how easy it was to publish his poetry, Crowley continued turning itout as quickly as the presses could print it.A cold chill filled the room, but not because it was January. Magical energycharged the temple, but not because of the ritual. No, it was that haggard manwith dark wild eyes that put everything out of sorts. AC didn’t know who he wasbut felt his unsettling energy throughout the ceremony. Crowley anxiouslydisrobed in the changing room, anticipating a lungful of open air.As he adjusted his floppy silk bow tie, his heart pounded with the sound ofapproaching footsteps. The man pierced him with his eyes. He had a thick browand an almost fanatical gaze. If not for his pallor and the physical sufferingexuded by his presence, he might have been handsome. For now, Crowley found himintimidating. “Little Brother,” he observed, “you have been meddling with theGoetia.”Crowley stared into his burning eyes, transfixed. “No, I haven’t.” It was a lie.He had been playing with magical tomes like Abramelin and the Goetia or Key ofSolomon ever since he moved into his Chancery Lane flat. Just the other night,he and Jones watched as semimaterialized figures and shadows paraded endlesslyaround the temple.“In that case,” the man continued, “the Goetia has been meddling with you.” Thenhe was gone again.The figure was Frater Iehi Aour (“Let there be light”), affectionately known asthe White Knight after Through the Looking-Glass. GD members ranked him secondonly to Mathers as a magician. They told the story of how, at a party, someoneridiculed the notion of a blasting wand as described in medieval texts on magic;Iehi Aour took offense, produced a long glass prism, and pointed it at theoffender. Fourteen hours later, doctors revived the skeptic.Other gossip described an altercation about Hinduism between Mathers and IehiAour. Mathers had rejected Frater IA’s contention that, by calling upon Shiva,one could cause the god to open his eyes and thereby destroy the world. To provehis point, IA plopped down on the floor of Mathers’s living room in lotusposition and began chanting, “Shiva, Shiva, Shiva …” Mathers, already agitatedby the argument, stormed out of the room. Returning half an hour later to findhis guest still at it, he erupted, “Will you stop blaspheming?” The mantracontinued. Mathers drew his revolver. “If you don’t stop, I’ll shoot you.” Themantra continued. Moïna entered the room just in time to end the argument,saving not just the White Knight but also the universe.The man behind the legend of Frater Iehi Aour was Allan Bennett (1872–1923).Born Charles Henry Allan Bennett during the Franco-Prussian war, his widowedmother raised him a strict Catholic. According to Crowley, he led a shelteredlife, still believing at age sixteen that angels brought babies to earth. Whenclassmates showed him an obstetrics manual, he found the facts of humanreproduction so offensive and degrading that he lost faith in a benevolent Godand abandoned Catholicism. At eighteen he briefly experienced the yogic tranceof Shivadarshana, wherein the entire universe is united and all sense of selfannihilated. Although he knew nothing of yoga, the vision was so profound thathe vowed, “This is the only thing worth while. I will do nothing else in all mylife but find out how to get back to it.” Thus he dedicated himself to the studyof Buddhist and Hindu scriptures. By 1894 he had joined the GD and performedmany legendary ceremonies. In one of these, he created a talisman for rain thatrequired water to work; he lost it in a sewer, and London had one of the wettestsummers on record. By twenty-five his magical prowess was renowned throughoutthe order.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_013_r1.jpg]Allan Bennett (1872–1923), Frater Iehi Aour. (photo credit 3.3)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c03-fig003a]Like Baker and Jones, he was an analytical chemist. He was tall, but asthma hadreduced him to a stoop. Opium, morphine, cocaine, and chloroform each rotatedfor two months as his antihistamine and inadvertently showed him the ability ofcertain drugs to open pathways to higher consciousness.Crowley was stunned to find Bennett living in a south London tenement withCharles Rosher, GD member, inventor, sportsman, and jack of all trades. Such agreat scholar ought not to live in squalor, Crowley believed. Realizing thatBennett could teach him more in a month than anyone else could in five years, heproposed a solution: since he needed a teacher and Bennett needed a benefactor,the White Knight could share Crowley’s flat in exchange for lessons in magic.Bennett accepted, and under his tutelage, Crowley progressed rapidly. Possessingall the order’s papers, Bennett provided his acolyte with a preview of thematerial he would receive. He also demonstrated his infamous wand:With this he would trace mysterious figures in the air, and, visible to theordinary eye, they would stand out in a faint bluish light. On great occasions,working in a circle and conjuring the spirits by great names … he would obtainthe creature … in visible and tangible form. On one occasion he evoked [theangel] Hismael and through a series of accidents, was led to step out of thecircle without effectively banishing the spirit. He was felled to the ground,and only recovered 5 or 6 hours later.22[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts022]In private moments Bennett insisted, “There exists a drug whose use will openthe gates of the World behind the Veil of Matter.” This introduced Crowley tothe controlled use of drugs for mystical purposes.Theirs was one of the strongest friendships Crowley would ever know. He alwaysspoke of Bennett with great respect. “There never walked a whiter man on earth,”Crowley described him. “A genius, a flawless genius.”23[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts023]In the months following his initiation, Crowley advanced steadily through theGD’s grades, graduating to Zelator in December 1898; Theoricus in January 1899;and Practicus in February. After an obligatory three-month interval, FraterPerdurabo reached the highest grade in the GD’s hierarchy, Philosophus, in May1899. He stood at the gates of the Second Order, where the great secrets ofmagic awaited. Soon he would advance to the Portal.It was time he met the head of the order, known in the First Order by the mottoFrater ’S Rioghail Mo Dhream (“Royal is my tribe”), in the Second Order asFrater Deo Duce Comite Ferro (“With God as my leader and the sword as mycompanion”), and, in the mundane world, as Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers. Heand Crowley shared many common interests. Both were athletic. Both basked in theromance of the Celtic revival, inventing romantic lineages for themselves;Mathers of the clan MacGregor and Crowley from the family O’Crowley. Both weredriven by aspirations to spiritual greatness, and both were scholars ofrecondite wisdom. Mathers saw great potential in Crowley and approved ofBennett’s accelerated instruction.By summer, Crowley was notorious in the order.In befriending Bennett and Mathers, he inspired suspicion, uneasiness, and envyamong senior members. The best magicians in the order had taken him under theirwings. Crowley was sharp, moving easily and briskly through the grades, and grewarrogant about his aptitude. Bennett, although respected, was also a figure ofawe and, to some, fear; thus Crowley’s tutelage under the White Knight seemeddarker still. Moreso, Perdurabo’s friendship with Mathers allied him in a campwhere loyalties were quickly dividing. Mathers was increasingly viewed as adespot, and Crowley became guilty by association.Part of his bad reputation traced to his friendship with Elaine Simpson (b.1875), known in the order as Semper Fidelis (“Always faithful”). Born inKussowlie, West Bengal, she was the daughter of Rev. William Simpson and Alice(née Hall); Elaine’s grandfather was Sir John Hall (1824–1907), the primeminister of New Zealand from 1879 to 1882. Alice Simpson was born inMahableshwar, India; the family’s temporary move to Germany during the 1860s“laid the foundation of the training in music and languages which enabled herlater in life to become a musician of repute and a linguist of considerablefame.”24 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts024] In 1873 she marriedRev. Simpson of the Indian Anglican Ecclesiastical Establishment, living withhim for some time in India. The Simpsons had two daughters: Elaine was theeldest, while the younger daughter, Beatrice, would move to New York, where shewould establish herself as an actress and poet under the stage name BeatriceIrwin.25 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts025] Both Alice and Elainebelonged to the order; although Crowley found Elaine charming, he had nothingnice to say about her mother, whom he described as “a horrible mother, asixth-rate singer, a first-rate snob, with dewlaps and a paunch; a match-maker,mischief-maker, maudlin and muddle-headed.”26[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts026] The hard feelings stem from arumor spread by Mrs. Simpson that Crowley had visited her daughter’s bedroom atnight in astral form. Both Aleister and Elaine denied the charge (but a fewyears later it inspired an experiment between them).Finally, even Crowley’s lifestyle fell under scrutiny. The older, staid membersbelieved that a magician should abstain from sex, drink, and drugs to keep hismind clear, and Crowley’s libertine ways went against the grain on all counts.Under Bennett’s guidance, he drank and took all manner of drugs—the memberscould only guess which ones. And his promiscuity quickly became legend: gossiplinked Crowley not only to Elaine Simpson but also to the Praemonstrix (actinghead), Florence Farr, and even Bennett himself. Still others suggested that “helived under various false names and left various districts without paying hisdebts.”27 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts027]Yeats and Crowley should have gotten along, considering how much they had incommon: the Celtic revival, magic, Decadence, and poetry.28[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts028] However, Crowley’s notorietymade him a difficult figure for Yeats to embrace when they met in the summer of1899. As Crowley’s friend Gerald Yorke later recalled,Crowley objected to Yeats on the grounds that he had deserted the Great Work forliterature. Yeats of Crowley that he had prostituted the Great Work and was a‘Black Magician.’ Both verbally to me. I think they were both mistaken, but bothhad fairly legitimate reasons for their opinion.29[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts029]Instead of becoming friends, circumstances made them rivals in three areas dearto their hearts: love, magic, and poetry.If there is but one iota of truth to the contention that they were rivals in “atleast one romantic affair” 30[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts030]—Florence Farr—this alone couldhave made them mortal enemies. Florence Beatrice Farr (1860–1917) was an earlyGD friend of Crowley’s, possibly through the astral projection study group sheran. The daughter of a successful doctor, she abandoned college at age eighteento pursue an acting career. After an unsuccessful marriage to Edward Emery, shebecame George Bernard Shaw’s (1856-1950) mistress in 1889. She joined the GD ayear later and, attracted to Yeats, found herself torn between two loves: Shawand Yeats, drama and magic. She chose magic, attaining prominence in both the GDhierarchy and Yeats’s affections. Crowley possessed “affectionate respecttempered by a feeling of compassion”31[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts031] for her. Farr’s biographermaintains that, while “There is no doubt that Florence and ‘The Beast’ … sharedsome sort of rapport for a short while,”32[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts032] they were not romanticallylinked.Another rivalry—magic—posed an obstacle to friendship with Yeats. Long a closefriend of Mathers, Yeats visited him and exchanged friendly correspondence afterhis move to Paris. Suddenly, a brash young upstart arrived, apparentlybrownnosing the order’s head. At the very least, Crowley became the friend toMathers that Yeats felt he should have been.If Crowley is to be believed, Yeats was also jealous of his talent as a poet.While correcting the proofs to Jephthah; and Other Mysteries, Lyrical andDramatic (1899), Crowley asked Yeats his opinion of the piece. Looking it over,Yeats replied politely, but Crowley detected rage and jealousy in his reply. Ifthe critics are right, Crowley may have been somewhat correct: most reviewersreceived Jephthah with praise. The Manchester Guardian wrote, “If Mr. Swinburnehad never written, we should all be hailing Mr. Aleister Crowley as a very greatpoet indeed,” while the Aberdeen Journal thought “He has caught the spirit inthe style of Swinburne, and in some respects the pupil is greater than hismaster.”33 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts033] The Outlook effused:Mr. Aleister Crowley possesses uncommon gifts. As behoves a person so blest, hedevotes himself to poesy. And there is no department of the sad mechanicexercise in which he fails of a kind of mastery. That is to say, his blank verseis almost unexceptionable; he will rhyme you fair sound rhymes from now toCandlemas; he is good at your strophe, your antistrophe, your chorus, yoursemi-chorus, your sonnet, your ode, your set of verses of all lengths; and hecan build a pleasure-house of sweet words upon the inane.34[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts034]Nevertheless, it would be Yeats, not Crowley, who would go on to win a Nobelprize for literature.Regardless of the reasons, these rivals in matters of love, magic and poetrystrongly disliked each other. Yeats admitted Crowley was handsome, but suspectedhe was mad. “[W]e did not think a mystical society was intended to be areformatory,” he wrote of Crowley.35[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts035] As a poet, Yeats felt Crowleyhad “written about six lines, amid much foul rhetoric, of real poetry.”36[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts036] Meanwhile, Crowley gave Irishwriter George Moore (1852–1933) a book with the inscription: “You write of Yeatsas ‘a poet in search of a pedigree’—but who told you he was a poet? Read ME!”37[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts037]Accusations of black magic finally emerged from this rivalry. Crowley describesone incident in “At the Fork in the Roads” (1910):38[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts038] During the summer of 1899, ACwas visited by Irish poet and artist Althea Gyles (1867–1949), who had drawn thecover of Yeats’s The Secret Rose (1897), Poems (1899), and The Wind among theReeds (1899)39 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts039] and whose workYeats praised:Miss Gyles’ images are so full of abundant and passionate life that they remindone of William Blake’s cry, “Exuberance is Beauty,” and Samuel Palmer’s commandto the artist, “Always seek to make excess more abundantly excessive.” One findsin them what a friend, whose work has no other passion, calls “the passion forthe impossible beauty” … [H]er inspiration is a wave of a hidden tide that isflowing through many minds in many places, creating a new religious art andpoetry.40 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts040]Despite being perceived as naive and spiritual—even Crowley remarked on “hersteely virginal eyes”41 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts041]—she wasalso working, and having an affair, with Leonard Smithers, much to the chagrinof her friends. Mackenzie, in her thinly disguised novel about Gyles, wrote thatshe,after treating reasonable admirers with prudish contempt, had fallen into thearms of an abominable creature of high intelligence, no morals, and the vividimagination which was perhaps what she had been waiting for. He had the worst ofreputations even among the Paris set. Ariadne lost caste, and when the affairended after more than a year of heady intoxication, and with a certain amount ofinspired work, she collapsed.42 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts042]According to “At the Fork in the Roads,” after a discussion on clairvoyance,Gyles put on her coat to leave and, in so doing, inadvertently scratched Crowleywith her brooch. The next day, when Crowley awoke feeling weak, Gyles admittedthat Yeats was using black magic to destroy him. With Crowley, distinguishingfact from fancy in his fiction is nearly impossible; when he calls the accounttrue in “every” detail, the claim wants for caution. It is unlikely Gyles gaveCrowley such a confession; if she did, we don’t know if it was volunteered orextracted. Regardless, enough happened for Crowley to write of himself (in thethird person):His house in London became charged with such an aura of evil that it wasscarcely safe to visit it. This was not solely due to P[erdurabo]’s ownexperiments; we have to consider the evil work of others in the Order … who wereattempting to destroy him. Weird and terrible figures were often seen movingabout his rooms, and in several cases, workmen and visitors were strucksenseless by a kind of paralysis and by fainting fits.43[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts043]Similarly, Yeats claimed “Crowley has been making wax images of us all, andputting pins in them.”44 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts044]Neither one of them imagined a real magical war would soon begin.“As life burns strong, the spirit’s flame grows dull,” Crowley wrote in hisfirst book. Now the life flame of his spiritual beacon Allan Bennett was wrackedby spasmodic asthma, was crumbling. Medicine had failed to cure him. Drugs hadceased to help. Something needed to be done.His only chance was to flee the “old grey country” of England in favor of awarm, dry climate … providing he lived long enough to move. Crowley and Jonesrecognized the failure of conventional avenues to cure their beloved Frater IehiAour, and journeyed down an alley they trusted more than the thoroughfares:magic. In an effort to prolong Bennett’s life enough for him to reach ahealthier climate, Crowley and Jones turned to the Goetia.The temple was thick with dittany of Crete burning in the censer in the south.An acacia altar, twice as tall as it was square, sat within the protectivecircle. Outside the circle, the Triangle of the Art awaited the appearance ofthe summoned spirit. With everything prepared, they conjured Buer, an infernalpresident who, according to the Goetia, “healeth all distempers in man.” It wasa modest working, for Buer, although he commanded fifty legions of spirits, wasbut a president in rank: neither a king, duke, prince, prelate, nor marquis.As they conjured, they noticed the clouds of incense dispersing unevenly,hanging in clumps in the air. In places, the smoke became almost opaque. AsFratres Perdurabo and Volo Noscere proceeded, the room cleared of incense exceptaround the censer, where it accumulated thick and heavy in a distinct pillar ofsmoke. A shape began materializing in the smoke. With their apparent success,the magicians proceeded to the “Stronger and More Potent Conjuration” from theGoetia, which caused parts of the figure to grow vaguely distinct. They made outa helmet, part of a tunic, and solid footgear.It was all wrong. It contradicted the Goetia’s description of Buer. Crowley andJones shot glances at each other, and decided against learning what they hadinadvertently summoned. Before the materialization completed, they banished andclosed the temple.Foyers was just another vacation for Crowley, an opportunity to scale the rocksoverlooking Loch Ness. He reposed on the north side of the Loch, across from theruins of Urquhart Castle, one of Scotland’s largest castles until it was bombedin 1692 to prevent the Jacobites from using it. Conquering cliff after cliff,rock after rock, Crowley reached the pinnacle of an outcropping and looked downat the countryside. Precipitous rocks juxtaposed hills of heather. The earthsloped up gently from the Loch. A larch- and pine-covered hillock filled onespot; upon its mound he saw a house.Named Boleskine, it was a huge one-story lodge, built in the late eighteenthcentury by the Honourable Archibald Fraser (1736-1815) and passed through theFraser family ever since. The manor boasted a pillared entranceway and terrace,a large formal garden, lodge, stable, boat house, and sacred well. It overlookedthe Fraser burial grounds, a seventeenth-century graveyard enclosed by aspear-tipped wrought-iron fence. A long driveway wound away from the house,through low-hanging trees, and toward the road that led to Foyers, 1.5 milessouth, and Inverness, eighteen miles north. The house, he thought, was perfectfor the Abramelin operation. The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Magestipulated that one’s oratory have windows opening onto an uncovered terrace,plus a lodge to the north. The building met these requirements.“I must have it,” he thought.He rang the owner, Mary Rose Burton, and explained his interest. She told himBoleskine was not for sale. He insisted he must have it, and offered her£2,000—twice its market value.45 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts045]She said it was a deal. By November, Boleskine was Crowley’s.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_014_r1.jpg]Boleskine, Crowley’s home on Loch Ness. (photo credit 3.4)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c03-fig004a]In the time between Boleskine’s discovery and sale, Crowley kept busy with magicand poetry. He eagerly discussed magic with Gerald Kelly, and one letter on thesubject is particularly illuminating in light of his later philosophy of theTrue Will:Conjure up the image of your father in your mind’s eye. When you have got himstanding before you almost as solid as if you were there, say, ‘I will go toA.C. at Boleskine, Foyers, Iverness’ in the most determined voice. Let everyincident of the day remind you of your will, and devote any spare moment to theimagination formula as well. In a very few days of this, interspersed withfrequent letters home stating your will, will certainly have the desiredeffect.46 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts046]On Halloween 1899, Kelly became Frater Eritis Similis Deo (“You will be likeGod”) on his introduction to the GD G. C. Jones sponsored Kelly, as he hadCrowley. Kelly found Jones sincere and likable; however, unimpressed by itsother members, Kelly never advanced beyond the grade of Neophyte.In November, Mathers authorized Crowley to act as his London agent concerningpublication and distribution of his Abramelin translation. Around this sametime, AC also arranged to publish five hundred copies of his own An Appeal tothe American Republic (1899). Reviews of this twelve-page booklet are notpreserved, but the poem was later reprinted in The English Review. He also wrotean essay on the magical significance of numbers; though never published in hislifetime, this fragment represents his first paper on a magical subject.A happy homeowner, Crowley plunged more than ever into the trappings of hisScottish surroundings. He took long walks over the moors, hunted red deer andgrouse, and called himself Laird Boleskine. On the edges of his land, he hungsigns reading “Beware of the Ichthyosaurus!” and “The Dinotheriums are outtoday!”47 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts047] Taking the lead of hisGD mentor, he also donned the red plaid kilt of the MacGregor tartan, andaffected the name Aleister MacGregor.With the perfect place in which to retire for the Abramelin operation, he wasready to advance through the portal from the First Order to the Second Order ofthe GD. He thus applied to the Second Order with all eagerness and sincerity.Their refusal stunned him. Crowley was being made an example for the order. Itwas nothing personal, as Farr liked Crowley and, several years later, woulddefend him in the New Age; but she deemed Crowley unfit. It was an example ofFarr playing the part of Praemonstrix, “a role which she assumed with occasionaloutrageous officiousness.”48 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts048]Some time between the ritual for Bennett’s health and Crowley’s rejection by theSecond Order, Crowley received another in a series of plaintive letters from oneof his lovers. Lilian Horniblow was the wife of Colonel Frank Herbert Horniblowof the Royal Engineers, who was stationed in India at this time.49[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts049] The affair ended when Perdurabodevoted himself to the Abramelin operation and observed the spiritual andphysical conditions of abstinence. She pleaded to see him again and invited himto her hotel. Although he had dismissed her previous requests, he agreed to thisone because he had a plan.He arrived at her room, confronted her coolly, and told her: “You are making amess of your life by your selfishness. I will give you a chance to do anabsolutely unfettered act. Give me £100. I won’t tell you whom it’s for, exceptthat it’s not for myself. I have private reasons for not using my own money inthis matter. If you give me this, it must be without hoping or expectinganything in return.”50 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts050] Crowley’sprivate reasons are curious: Bennett needed £100 to leave England. Crowleyrefused to give the money himself not out of greed but because he feared thetransaction would ruin their friendship. Although Crowley provided Bennett withfree room and board, he did so in exchange for lessons in magic. Thus bothparties retained their dignity.One hundred pounds. His mistress pondered, and handed it over. Crowley took itand beat a hasty retreat from her life.The Buddhist monasteries were Bennett’s destination. Magic was useless to himthere, so on his departure he gave his GD notes to Crowley.51[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts051] Then he was gone. On Bennett’sdeparture, AC wrote:O Man of Sorrows: brother unto Grief!O pale with suffering, and dumb hours of pain!O worn with Thought! thy purpose springs againThe Soul of Resurrection: thou art chiefAnd lord of all thy mind: O patient thiefOf God’s own fire! What mysteries find faneIn the white shrine of thy white spirit’s reign,Thou man of Sorrows: O, beyond belief!52[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts052]Meanwhile, Crowley’s jilted mistress had more than a cold shoulder in mind whenshe handed over £100 for mysterious purposes. When all she received was ahurried thank-you, she protested. Word got around, and that January, LairdBoleskine invited her to stay at his new home. He offered to pay her expenses ascompensation for the money in dispute. She accepted and made the journey.No doubt precipitating this invitation, Horniblow had warned Crowley that he wasabout to find himself in what he, in his diary, referred to as “Great Trouble.”The nature of this trouble varies: one account has Horniblow complaining to thepolice about her loss of £100, and some of Yeats’s letters (quoted below)support this theory. Another connects this to Crowley’s relationship withPollitt back at Cambridge. Supporting this homosexual scandal theory, hereceived two letters on January 15, 1900, warning that the police were watchinghim and his friends at 67 Chancery Lane because of something related to the“brother of a college chum.”53 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts053]When refused entry into the GD’s Second Order, the reason was suspicion of “sexintemperance on Thomas Lake Harris lines in order to gain magical power—bothsexes are here connoted.”54 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts054]Indeed, both scandals may have come into play.That night, Crowley continued on to Paris and visited Mathers. On Tuesday,January 16, Mathers initiated him into the grade of Adeptus Minor (5°=6°), thefirst grade of the GD’s Second Order. While the First Order was known as theOrder of the Golden Dawn in the Outer, the Second Order was called the RoseaRubea et Aurea Crucis (Ruby Rose and Cross of Gold).Like all GD initiations, this one involved dramatic ritual. It drew heavily uponRosicrucian symbolism and Mathers’s connections with the SRIA. The initiate wasinstructed by officers, then dressed in a black Robe of Mourning and draped withthe Chain of Humility. Next, he was tied to the Cross of Suffering, and took thefollowing tenfold oath:(1) I, [the candidate’s motto is used here], a member of the body of Christ, dothis day, on behalf of the Universe, spiritually bind myself, even as I am nowbound physically unto the Cross of Suffering:(2) That I will do the utmost to lead a pure an unselfish life.(3) That I will keep secret all things connected with this Order; that I willmaintain the Veil of strict secrecy between the First and Second Order.(4) That I will uphold to the utmost the authority of the Chiefs of the Order.(5) Furthermore that I will perform all practical work connected with thisOrder, in a place concealed; that I will keep secret this inner RosicrucianKnowledge; that I will only perform any practical magic before the uninitiatedwhich is of a simple and already well-known nature, and that I will show them nosecret mode of working whatsoever.(6) I further solemnly promise and swear that, with the Divine permission, Iwill from this day forward apply myself unto the Great Work, which is so topurify and exalt my spiritual Nature that with the Divine Aid I may at lengthattain to be more than human, and thus gradually raise and unite myself to myhigher and divine Genius, and that in this event I will not abuse the GreatPower entrusted unto me.(7) I furthermore solemnly pledge myself never to work at any important Symbolor Talisman without first invocating the Highest Divine Names connectedtherewith; and especially not to debase my knowledge of Practical magic topurposes of Evil.(8) I further promise always to display brotherly love and forbearance towardsthe members of the whole Order.(9) I also undertake to work unassisted at the subjects prescribed for study inthe various practical grades.(10) Finally, if in my travels I should meet a stranger who professes to be amember of the Rosicrucian Order, I will examine him with care, beforeacknowledging him to be so.55 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts055]The Robe of Mourning and Chain of Suffering were removed from the candidate, whonext learned the history of the Rosicrucian Order: it began with ChristianRosenkreuz, a mythical German noble who was initiated into the Mysteries inArabia in 1393. He traveled and studied the teachings of world religions until1410, when he and four Masons whom he had initiated founded a temple of the RosyCross. After Rosenkreuz died he was buried in a vault within the templeundisturbed until, over a century later, a brother who had been repairing thetemple discovered a secret door inscribed with the words POST CXX ANNOS PATEBO(I will be found after 120 years). The rediscovery of the vault occurredprecisely 120 years after Rosenkreuz’s death.The name Crowley chose as an Adeptus Minor was one he guarded closely all hislife. He recorded this motto in only one notebook as Christeos Luciftias. In theEnochian angelic language, it means “let there be light.” Allan Bennett’s mottomeant the same thing in Hebrew; the reference to his friend and mentor is clear.Crowley’s motto is also interesting as its surface resemblance to WesternChristian terms contrasts and unites the names of Christ and Lucifer.56[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts056] Its only appearance in print isas the “translator” of “Ambrosii Magi Hortus Rosarum,” a satirical Rosicrucianessay included in his Works.The initiation marked a milestone for Crowley. Dissatisfied with theinstructions of the First Order, he had followed advice to wait until he reachedthe Second Order before judging the system. The First Order, he had learned,served only to prepare the student; the Second Order taught the application ofmagic. Now he was ready for the real secrets. The initiation was also a victoryfor Mathers. While the order in London had refused to advance Crowley, Mathersoverruled Farr’s decision. The war had begun.While in Paris, Crowley asked Mathers for advice on the legal trouble brewing inLondon. Mathers examined Crowley’s astrological chart and, based on the date ofthe letters of warning, concluded there was real danger. However, his Saturn onthe cusp of Capricorn mitigated things. “You are strong and the end of thematter is good,” Mathers counseled. “By all means, avoid London.”57[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts057]Using the lunar pantacle from the Key of Solomon in order to avoid trouble,Crowley took his chances and briefly returned to London to check in with hisassociates. While Bennett, Jones, and Eckenstein believed his concerns wereunfounded, GD member W. E. H. Humphrys warned Crowley that he was indeed wanted,and that the danger was greatest just before Easter.Crowley left London and reached Boleskine safely on February 7. In his absence,Horniblow had left without warning or explanation. The reason lies in one ofYeats’s letters about the GD’s activities at this time:We found out that his [Mathers’s] unspeakable mad person [Crowley] had a victim,a lady who was his mistress and from whom he extorted large sums of money. Twoor three of our thaumaturgists … called her up astrally, and told her to leavehim. Two days ago (and about two days after the evocation) she came to one ofour members (she did not know he was a member) and told a tale of perfectlymedieval iniquity—of positive torture, and agreed to go to Scotland Yard andthere have her evidence taken down. Our thaumaturgist had never seen her, norhad she any link with us of any kind.58[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts058]Nothing would ever come of this, although the gossip would haunt Crowley yearslater in the yellow press.Crowley waited langorously in his tranquil new neighborhood for things to quietdown in London. On Saturday, February 24, he began recording his preparationsfor the Abramelin working, starting with his Oath of the Beginning:I, Perdurabo, Frater Ordinis Rosae Rubeae et Aureae Crucis, a Lord of the Pathsin the Portal of the Vault of the Adepts, a 5°=6° of the Order of the GoldenDawn; and an humble servant of the Christ of God; do this day spiritually bindmyself anew:By the Sword of Vengeance:By the Powers of the Elements:By the Cross of Suffering:That I will devote myself to the Great Work: the obtaining of Communion with myown Higher and Divine Genius (called the Guardian Angel) by means of theprescribed course; and that I will use my Power so obtained unto the Redemptionof the Universe.So help me the Lord of the Universe and mine own Higher Soul!59[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts059]With these words, he also took an Obligation of the Operation, which he adaptedfrom his Adeptus Minor oath.From the outset, circumstances seemed to oppose this working. Jones was theobvious choice for Crowley’s assistant, but he was unable to come to Boleskine.Therefore, Crowley summoned Bennett’s old roommate, Charles Rosher; he helpedfor a while but sneaked off early one morning and caught a steamer to Inverness,never to return. Rosher’s replacement was an old Cambridge friend, who also cameand left suddenly. Finally, Boleskine’s teatotalling lodge-keeper went on athree-day drinking binge and tried to kill his wife and children. This andsimilar phenomenon convinced Crowley that the daily prayers and conjurationswhich constituted the Abramelin working were also attracting malevolentforces.60 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts060]Florence Farr, troubled by her schism with Mathers, resigned as bothPraemonstrix of the Isis-Urania temple and as his London representative. Mathersfeared her resignation indicated Westcott’s attempt at a coup: on February 16 hesent her a letter claiming that Westcotthas never been at any time either in personal or in written communication withthe Secret Chiefs of the Order, he having either himself forged or procured tobe forged the professed correspondence between him and them, and my tonguehaving been tied all these years by a previous Oath of Secrecy to him.61[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts061]The accusation was devastating. If Mathers was telling the truth, then she hadbeen living a lie for years, initiating people under false pretenses.To sort out her feelings, Farr returned to her childhood home of Bromley, where,after much contemplation and soul-searching, she decided to share the letterwith six other members of the Second Order. On March 3, these seven formed aninformal committee to quietly decide what they should do about Mathers’saccusations. The committee included Farr, Yeats, and Jones, as well as Mr. andMrs. E. A. Hunter, M. W. Blackden, and P. W. Bullock.On March 18, Bullock wrote Mathers on behalf of the committee, expressing shockover the letter’s implications and requesting proof of its accusations. Mathersshot an angry letter to Farr, refusing to recognize any committee formed “toconsider my private letter to you … All these complications could have beenavoided had you written me an open straightforward letter at the beginning ofthe year, saying you wished to retire from office.”62[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts062]Two days later, Yeats contacted Westcott. The Rosicrucian Supreme Magus’sresponse was noncommittal:Speaking legally, I find I cannot prove the details of the origin of theknowledge and history of the G.D., so I should not be just nor wise to bias youropinion of them.Mr. M. may insinuate and claim the authorship because I cannot disprove him. Howcan I say anything now, because if I accepted this new story, then Mrs. Woodmanwould rightly charge me with slandering her dead husband’s reputation, for hewas answerable for the original history; and if I say M.’s new story is wrong Ishall be open to violent attack by him and I shall have to suffer hispersecution.I must allow you to judge us both to the best of your judgement, and to decideon your responsibility.63 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts063]On March 23, Mathers sent poison pen letters to Farr and Bullock, againexpressing umbrage at having his letter shown to others and refusing torecognize their committee. Calling on the vows of obedience to him which allmembers signed in 1896, he forbade the committee to meet and ordered them toabandon the inquiry. He also dismissed Farr as his representative.The next day, the committee met to decide on a plan of action, and Bullock wroteapologetically to Mathers, stating that his letter forbidding meetings reachedhim after the committee had already met. Mathers wrote back to Bullock on April2 and threatened the committee. “And for the first time since I have beenconnected with the Order,” he wrote, “I shall formulate my request to HighestChiefs for the Punitive Current to be prepared, to be directed against those whorebel.”64 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts064]The situation in London had continued for over a month when Crowley made hisfirst contact with the lodge since his initiation by Mathers. From Boleskine, hewrote Maud Cracknell, assistant secretary of the Second Order, whom he bitterlycalled “an ancient Sapphic crack, unlikely to be filled.”65[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts065] As an Adeptus Minor in the GD,he requested the instructional papers to which he was entitled, but Cracknelltold him he needed to deal directly with Mrs. Hunter, his superior in the order.Crowley’s letter to her couldn’t have been worse timed. Hunter was on theinvestigative committee and unkindly disposed to Mathers. On March 25, Mrs.Hunter sent Crowley a reply wherein she refused to recognize his initiation intothe Second Order. “The Second Order is apparently mad,” he mused. In Crowley’smind, Mathers wasunquestionably a Magician of extraordinary attainment. He was a scholar and agentleman.… As far as I was concerned, Mathers was my only link with the SecretChiefs to whom I was pledged. I wrote to him offering to place myself and myfortune unreservedly at his disposal; if that meant giving up the Abra-MelinOperation for the present, all right.66[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts066]A week later, Mathers accepted the offer. In his diary, Crowley noted,D.D.C.F. accepts my services, therefore do I again postpone the Operation ofAbramelin the Mage, having by God’s Grace formulated even in this a new linkwith the Higher, and gained a new weapon against the Great princes of the Evilof the World. Amen.67 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts067]On Tuesday, April 3, Crowley stopped in London to ask his oldest friends in theorder their opinion of the rebellion. Baker told Crowley he was sick of all thepoliticking in the order, while Jones insisted that, without Mathers, there wasno GD. Elaine Simpson also took Mathers’s side. Crowley also consulted Kelly andHumphrys, but their reactions are unrecorded.That Saturday, Crowley appeared at the Second Order’s meeting room at 36 BlytheRoad. His plan was to reconnoiter the order’s property for Mathers, but he foundthe vault locked and Miss Cracknell on duty. “I insist I be allowed inside,” hepressed her.“The Vault is closed by order of the committee, and no one can go in without itsconsent,” she told the intruder coolly.“Have you a key?”“I’m a new member and don’t have a private key,” she lied.“Can you go in yourself?”“No,” she lied again. “Perhaps you’d better go to Mrs. Emery, or Mr. Hunter orMr. Blackden.”“On the contrary. It is they who should come to me.” At that, he dramaticallystormed out of the room. Satisfied with his observation of the situation inLondon, he proceeded to France.Crowley returned to 28 rue St. Vincent on Monday, April 9, and proposed astrategy to the Matherses: Crowley should return to London and summon themembers of the Second Order individually to headquarters. There, they wouldencounter a masked man (Crowley) and his scribe. They would answer whether theybelieved in the truth of the teachings of the Second Order and were willing tostop the revolt; then they would sign a vow of obligation to the GD. Any refusalwould mean expulsion.Mathers accepted the plan. On April 11 he penned letters of authorization forCrowley. The next day, Crowley entered the following oath into his diary:I, Perdurabo, as the Temporary Envoy Plenipotentiary of Deo Duce Comite Ferro &thus the Third from the Secret Chiefs of the Order of the Rose of Ruby and theCross of Gold, do deliberately invoke all laws, all powers Divine, demandingthat I, even I, be chosen to do such a work as he has done, at all costs tomyself. And I record this holy aspiration in the Presence of the Divine Light,that it may stand as my witness.68[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts068]Crowley left Paris at 11:50 a.m. on April 13. For protection, Mathers gave him aRose Cross, the Rosicrucian talisman. He warned Crowley to expect magicalattack, and know that sure signs were mysterious fires or fires refusing toburn. It was the best he could do to prepare Crowley for the fight ahead.Back in London, Crowley’s first tactic was to contact GD members loyal toMathers. He hired a cab to take him to two of these members, Mrs. Simpson andDr. Berridge. During the ride, the paraffin lights on the carriage caught fireand the cab could go no further. Most mysterious, Crowley thought, in light ofMathers’s warning about fires. He hailed another cab, and as he rode along thehorse bolted inexplicably.When he finally arrived at Mrs. Simpson’s, Crowley noted the refusal of herhearth fire to remain lit, while his rubber raincoat, nowhere near the fire,spontaneously combusted. Mathers appeared to be correct about the fires: whenthey should have burned, they did not; when they were burning, they behavedmysteriously; when they should not be, they appeared. Crowley concluded he wasunder magical attack.Taking out the Rose Cross, Crowley clenched the protective talisman given to himby Mathers and noticed something unusual about it. Its color was bleaching out,fading. In one day’s time, the talisman was nearly white.During this time as Mathers’s plenipotentiary, Crowley also had his one and onlycontact with Supreme Magus William Wynn Westcott:I only saw the old boy once in my life, and then merely on an errand fromMathers to tell him he had incurred a traitor’s doom. And I only wrote to himonce, and that to demand that he should deposit the famous Cypher Manuscriptswith the British Museum as their secrecy was being used for purposes of fraud.69[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts069]Westcott was less receptive to Crowley’s communications than he was to Yeats’s.Thirty-six Blythe Road was the rebel base. As the Second Order’s Londonheadquarters, it was the source of the insurrection’s power. Without it, theywould be dead in the water.On Monday, April 16, Crowley met C. E. Wilkinson, landlord of the room, andconvinced him that he had authority to enter and occupy the premises. The nextday, he returned with Elaine Simpson to wrest headquarters from the dissidents.They found Cracknell in the room, repeating her statement that the rooms hadbeen closed by Farr’s order. As Mathers’s plenipotentiary, Crowley gleefullyexpelled the Sapphic Crack from the order. She rushed off and sent a telegram toE. A. Hunter: “Come at once to Blythe Road, something awful has happened.”When Hunter arrived, he was shocked to encounter resistance in entering theroom. Then he found Crowley in the supposedly locked premises, having apparentlyforced open the doors and changed the locks. Crowley proudly declared, “We havetaken possession of headquarters by the authority of MacGregor Mathers.” Hehanded over his letters of authority.Hunter looked the papers over. “The authority of that gentleman has beensuspended by a practically unanimous vote by the members of the society,” hereplied dryly.Undaunted, Crowley turned his attack to Cracknell, who had entered the room withHunter. Jabbing a finger in her direction, he continued. “That woman must leavethe room. She has been suspended from membership.”Hunter shook his head. “I will not allow it. Not without her consent.”Meanwhile, Farr appeared with a constable. Unfortunately, the authorities werepowerless to help her. The landlord was not present to verify ownership of thepremises, and Farr had not put into writing her orders for the rooms to beclosed. Crowley was technically in possession of the rooms.Victorious, AC proceeded according to plan. To cancel the proposed meeting ofthe renegade Second Order on April 21 and to summon all members for their testof allegiance, he sent the following telegram:You are cited to appear at Headquarters at 11:45 am on the 20th inst.Should you be unable to attend, an appointment at the earliest possible momentmust be made by telegraphing to ‘MacGregor’ at Headquarters. There will be nomeeting on the 21st inst. By the order of Deo Duce Comite Ferro, Chief of theS[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]O[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]70[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts070]Two days later, on April 19, Yeats and Hunter found Wilkinson, the landlord.Since members came and went regularly, he explained, he assumed Crowley was aswelcome as any other. However, he agreed that Farr, who paid the bills, could dowhatever she wanted with the rooms. They thereupon showed him a letter fromFarr, authorizing them to change her locks.At 11:30 that same morning, Crowley’s figure cut a spectacle through the shopbelow. He appeared in Highland dress with a plaid over his head and shoulders, ahuge gold cross around his neck, and a dagger at his waist. According to plan,he wore a black mask over his face to conceal his identity.71[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts071] Crowley marched past the shopclerk, who notified Wilkinson. The landlord—having passed word along to Yeats,Hunter, and the constable—stopped Crowley in the back hall and forbade him fromentering the premises. When the constable arrived, he advised Crowley to get alawyer.Yeats and Hunter spent the rest of the day refusing as “name unknown” the floodof telegrams which arrived for “MacGregor.” This was interrupted at 1 o’clock bythe arrival of a burly fellow who had been wandering the London streets for twohours trying to find 36 Blythe Road. Crowley had hired him outside Alhambra, aLeicester Square pub, for thirteen shillings four pence. The man had no idea whyhe was wanted there: he thought some sort of entertainment would be provided.Later that day, the committee met and suspended Mathers, Berridge, and Mrs. andMiss Simpson from the Second Order. They further moved “no person shall bedeemed to belong to the London branch who has not been initiated by that body inLondon.” It was a smack in Crowley’s face. The Mathers loyalists were unamusedby their suspension. On Friday, April 20, Dr. Berridge (c. 1843–1923) replied tothe committee upon learning of his expulsion:I am in receipt of your note of yesterday in which you convey to me the decisionof the self-appointed and unauthorised committee of your new ArchaeologicalAssociation.I have read it carefully but am at present unable to decide where impudence orimbecility is its predominant characteristic.As I have never been a member of your new Society I cannot be suspended fromsuch non-existent membership.72 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts072]The next day, the committee reached a decision about Mathers: if his accusationsof forgery were true, then he was guilty of fraud. If he was lying, then he wasguilty of slander against a brother of the order. In either case, Mathers’s wordwas worthless.Even at this point the battle raged. Crowley summonsed Farr to appear before thepolice magistrate of the West London Police Court on April 27 on charges of“unlawfully and without just cause detaining certain papers and other articles,the property of the Complainant.”73[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts073] He wanted either the itemsreturned or £15 remuneration. Appealing to friends in high places, the SecondOrder rebels hired as their representative Charles Russell, son of the LordChief Justice. Yeats feared his name would be dragged into the case and,awaiting the court hearing, wrote:The case comes on next Saturday, and for a week I have been worried to deathwith meetings, law and watching to prevent a sudden attack on the rooms. Forthree nights I did not get more than 4½ hours sleep any night. The trouble isthat my Kabbalists are hopelessly unbusinesslike and thus minutes and the likeare in complete confusion.74 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts074]To their advantage, however, they learned Crowley had been blacklisted by theTrades’ Protection Association for a bad debt; so they called in a trade unionrepresentative to testify in their defense.Cracknell sent a letter to Crowley’s counsel in an effort to clear matters up.She explained that Farr was president and Hunter treasurer of the order; Mathersacted only as honorary head, but had never been in 36 Blythe Road, let alonecontributed financially to its upkeep. She also described how Crowley broke intothe premises, adding, “certain things of pecuniary value to the society werefound to be missing.”75 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts075]The day of the trial, Yeats—having just been elected the GD’s new leader—sat athome like an expectant mother, awaiting the news. He wrote to Lady Gregory:I do not think I shall have any more bother for we have got things into shapeand got a proper executive now and even if we lose the case it will not causeany confusion though it will give one Crowley, a person of unspeakable life, themeans to carry on a mystical society which will give him control of theconscience of many.76 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts076]He finished and sealed the letter but, before he could mail it, the newsarrived. They had won. Crowley’s solicitor, concluding they had no case, fearedthe GD would claim their losses exceeded £15, thus taking the case to a highercourt. To avoid this complication, they withdrew charges for a £5 penalty.Easter had passed, and it was thus too late for Crowley to resume the Abramelinoperation. He returned to Boleskine for a few somber days, then returned toMathers in Paris. Berridge, he learned, had joined Westcott to set up a newbranch of Isis-Urania under Mathers’s direction.77[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts077] Evidently the controversy didnot prevent Mathers and Westcott from collaborating.During his visit, Crowley convinced Mathers to unleash the punitive currentagainst the rebels. He thus spent a Sunday afternoon watching Mathers baptizedried peas in the names of the rebels and rattling them around inside a sieve.Crowley, unimpressed, recorded, “nobody seemed a penny the worse.”78[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts078]Thus ended the revolt in the GD, with Mathers believing he had been the victimof a conspiracy, and Yeats regretting the loss of a friend. Shortly after thebreak, Yeats recalled Mathers respectfully: “MacGregor apart from certaindefinite ill doings and absurdities … has behaved with dignity and evencourtesy.”79 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts079] Years later, herecalled his old friend in a poem:I call MacGregor Mathers from his grave,For in my first hard spring-time we were friends,Although of late estranged.I thought him half a lunatic, half knave,And told him so, but friendship never ends …80[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts080]In 1925 he fondly dedicated his book A Vision to Moïna. Although they partedbitterly, the Matherses’ influence upon him never faded."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURTHE MOUNTAIN HOLDS A DAGGERWhen Count and Countess MacGregor of Glenstrae stepped onto the stage of theBodinière Theater in Paris, clothed in Egyptian raiment, they became the HighPriest Rameses and the High Priestess Anari in public celebrations of the Riteof Isis. Beginning around October 1899, these public ceremonies involved bothRameses and Anari invoking the goddess Isis. A Parisian dancer in long whiterobes next performed invocations of the four elements: the danse des fleurs(earth), danse du miroir (water), danse de la chevelure (fire), and dance desparfums (air). Finally, offerings of flowers or wheat were thrown upon the altarby female and male attendees, respectively. “The ceremony was artistic in theextreme,” remarked reporter Frederick Lees. The object of these rites was togenerate interest in their mystery school, and in this they were apparentlysuccessful: the receptions and celebrations hosted at their residence—“amongstthe most interesting in Paris”—attracted “scientists, doctors, lawyers,painters, and men and women of letters, besides persons of high rank.”1[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts001]Crowley, while attending these rites, met American soprano Susan Strong(1870–1946). Born in Brooklyn, she inherited a fortune when her father, lawyerand former New York State Senator Demas Strong (1820–1893), died of heartfailure on November 9, 1893. He had been part of the California gold rush in1849 and, accumulating a fortune, returned home to Brooklyn and enteredpolitics.2 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts002] With her oldersiblings married, Susan, aged twenty-two, moved to London and studied singingfor her own amusement at the Royal Academy of Music under Hungarian composer andteacher Francis Korbay (1846–1913). Both her vocal and acting ability convincedKorbay that she could be a great diva, and he encouraged her to audition for theEnglish Opera Company. Although she sang as Elsa in Lohengrin (1893), herbig-stage debut at Covent Garden two years later as Sieglinde, in anEnglish-language version of Die Walküre, made her an overnight star.3[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts003] The Academy called herperformance “a veritable triumph,”4[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts004] while the Times raved, “artisticas her singing is it is thrown into the shade by her wonderful skill as anactress. Gifted with a fine physique and an unusually dignified stage presence,her command of beautiful and appropriate gesture is such as the most experiencedsingers rarely attain.”5 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts005] In ahighly uncharacteristic gesture of appreciation noted by the Times, she wasgiven numerous bouquets at the conclusion of the first act.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_015_r1.jpg]American soprano Susan Strong (1870–1946) in her breakout role as Sieglinde fromWagner’s Die Walküre. (photo credit 4.1)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c04-fig001a]Based on this performance, Strong was engaged for the 1896 season at Bayreuth,followed by her New York debut later that fall. In the years that followed shetoured America and regularly returned to London. By the time Crowley met her,Strong’s repertoire had expanded to include the demanding roles of Marguerite(Gounod’s Faust, in 1896), Aïda (Verdi’s Aïda, in 1897–1898), Brünnhilde(Wagner’s Siegfried, in 1898), Donna Anna (Mozart’s Don Giovanni, in 1900),Freïa (Wagner’s Das Rheingold, in 1900), and Gutrune (Wagner’s Götterdämmerung,in 1900). She originally performed as Venus at Covent Garden in Tannhäuser inJune 1899, and reprised both the role and the venue in May–June 1900, whichmatches the time in which Crowley says he saw her portray Venus at CoventGarden.6 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts006]From her attending Mathers’s public ritual, one wonders to what degree sheshared Crowley’s interest in the occult; indeed, AC identifies her as “a memberof the Order.”7 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts007] She took him “bystorm,” he punned, and a relationship sprung up between them. He summarized hisrelationship with Strong, “She courteously insisted on my sampling the goodswith which she proposed to endow me. The romance of an intrigue with so famousan artist excited my imagination”8[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts008] They fell in love and soonbecame engaged. The only delay was supposedly the disposal of her husband, thenin Texas. The marriage never materialized.9[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts009] Crowley had the good fortune ofknowing Strong at the height of her career; after a few more years of singing,she retired from the stage to open a high-class London laundry on Baker Streetcalled Nettoyage de Linge de Luxe.10[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts010] Despite the rave reviews shereceived at the time, the New Grove Dictionary of Opera accords Strong a lessillustrious place in history: “Her few recordings, mostly of songs, show animaginative artist with a voice probably not meant by nature for the heavy rolesshe undertook.”11 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts011]Another pair of Mathers’s Parisian friends, recounting tales of their Mexicovacation, reminded Crowley of Eckenstein’s invitation to climb mountains there.With GD business settled and the Abramelin operation postponed, his time wasfree and his wallet cumbersome. One can’t help but wonder whether Crowley’slegal troubles back in London also motivated him. Regardless, in June 1900England became just another port as the SS Pennsylvania, Crowley’s new home,sailed for the United States. On Independence Day, still en route, he wrote acommemorative poem:The ship to the breezes is bended;The wind whistles off to the lee;The sun is arisen, the splendid!The sun on the marvellous sea!And the feast of your freedom is ended,O sons of the free!12 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts012]The poem’s critical tone shows Crowley was prepared to dislike the States. Whathe found when he arrived around July 6 made disdain even easier.Like much of the northeastern United States (and Europe soon thereafter), NewYork was at the peak of a record-breaking heat wave that began in late June. OnJuly 1, both New York and Philadelphia recorded the hottest day on record at 98and 102 degrees respectively, with similar temperatures reported fromWashington, D.C., to St. Louis. By the time Crowley arrived, there were overfour hundred heat-related deaths in Manhattan alone, eight hundred throughoutthe metropolitan area, and hundreds more in New Jersey and New England. Evenmore were hospitalized with heat prostration, taxing the health care system.13[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts013] The temperature and humidityleft Crowley, like so many others, prostrated. Miles of glass and concreteaccentuated the heat, and he found the constant bustle repellent. He thought tohimself, “The people tend to behave like the Madrileños … ‘Festina lente’ and‘More haste, less speed’ ought to be painted up at every street corner.”14[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts014] After only two or three days, hecaught a train for Mexico City.Crowley preferred Mexico. Although hot, it was nowhere near as humid as NewYork. He rented part of a house overlooking the Alameda and hired a young localwoman as his maid. That summer, he bought an orange pony in Iguala and wentsightseeing until a bout of malaria forced him to rest in a luxurious formerpalace, the Hotel Iturbide.Mexico’s rustic simplicity and stability provided a prolific phase for Crowley.The mass of poetry written at this time runs the gamut, from hauntingconfessions of desperate loneliness to travelogues and mystical ecstasy. “TheGrowth of God” is of the chilling variety:Even as beasts, where the sepulchral oceanSobs, and their fins and feet keep Runic pace,Treading in water mysteries of motion,Witch-dances: where the ghastly carapaceOf the blind sky hangs on the monstrous verge:Even as serpents, wallowing in the slime;So my thoughts raise misshapen heads, and urgeHorrible visions of decaying Time.15[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts015]Other poems from this period—all later published in Oracles (1905)—include“Assumpta Canidia,” “March in the Tropics,” “Metempsychosis” and “Night in theValley,” and “Venus.” The latter work expresses feelings of longing, regret, andeven insecurity for his Venus, Susan Strong:MISTRESS and maiden and mother, immutable mutable soul!Love, shalt thou turn to another? Surely I give thee the whole!Light, shall thou flicker or darken? Thou and thy lover are met.Bend from thy heaven and hearken! Life, shalt thou fade or forget?I know thee not, who art naked; I lie beneath thy feetWho hast called till my spirit ached with a pang too deathly sweet.Thou has given thee to me dying, and made thy bed to me.I shiver, I shrink, and, sighing, lament it cannot be.O Goddess, maiden, and wife! Is the marriage bed in vain?Shall my heart and soul and life shrink back to themselves again?Be thou my one desire, my soul in day as in night!My mind the home of the Higher! My heart the centre of Light!16[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts016]Similar echoes of Strong appear in one of Crowley’s more paradoxical creations.On the heels of a torrid afternoon in a slum, his lover left him unsatisfied;thinking of his former fiancée, he wrote his own version of Tannhäuser insixty-seven uninterrupted hours of writing. It is a piece that by its naturejuxtaposes sex and creativity, England and Mexico, actress and lover. Despiteinspired moments, it is ultimately long and difficult, although Crowleyconsidered it the pinnacle of the first phase of his poetry.In addition to writing, Crowley also began testing the GD instruction oninvisibility. Based on the formula used in the Neophyte initiation, the ritualto bestow this power involved banishing the area: He began by energizing andgrounding the energy centers of his body, giving the sign of the kabbalisticcross and intoning the Hebrew words for “Thine is the kingdom, the power andglory unto the ages, amen.” Next, he traced a circle in the air around himself,stopping at the east, south, west, and north quadrants to draw a protectivepentagram and to call on one of the sacred Hebrew names of God. Calling upon thearchangels Raphael, Gabriel, Michael, and Uriel to oversee and protect him, theritual space would be duly purified. A recitation of the first EnochianKey—reputedly written in the language of the angels and passed down fromElizabethan magician John Dee—followed. Finally, Crowley invoked the powers ofconcealment. The magician, visualizing a shroud about his or her body, shouldgradually and partially turn invisible … or so they said. The key to theillusion was neither optical nor physical, since the magician never trulydisappeared. However, he did take advantage of distraction, one of the oldestprinciples of sleight of hand: the invisible magician affected about himself anaura which made his presence ordinary, subliminal, almost chameleonlike. WhenCrowley saw his reflection begin to flicker like a motion picture, he knew hewas on to something. He considered himself successful when he was able to strollthrough Mexico City in a golden crown and scarlet robe without attracting anyattention.On November 14 and 17 he experimented further with the Enochian evocations ofDoctor John Dee. In Dee’s system, the spiritual world was stratified into thirtyAethyrs, each with its own name and conjuration. By reading the key and gazinginto his crystal, Crowley unlocked the moods and visions of that sphere, writingthem down as they happened. His results are surrealistic, apocalyptic, and bearthe stamp of his evangelical upbringing:An immense eagle-angel is before me. His wings seem to hide all the Heaven.He cried aloud saying: The Voice of the Lord upon the Waters: the Terror of Godupon Mankind. The voice of the Lord maketh the Skies to tremble: the Stars aretroubled: the Aires fall. The First Voice Speaketh and saith: Cursed, cursed bethe Earth, for her iniquity is great. Oh Lord! Let Thy Mercy be lost in thegreat Deep! Open thine eyes of Flame and Light, O God, upon the wicked! Lightenthine Eyes! The Clamour of Thy Voice, let it smite down the Mountains!17[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts017]He knew only limited success, however, for he was not yet advanced enough topass through or comprehend any Aethyrs beyond the first two (working his way upfrom the thirtieth to the twenty-ninth).Shortly afterward he met an old man named Don Jesus de Medina-Sidonia, ahigh-ranking chief in Scottish Rite Freemasonry (apparently unbeknownst toCrowley, this was “a miniscule irregular body”).18[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts018] Crowley’s knowledge of themysteries so impressed Don Jesus that the Mason conferred upon him the 33°, thehighest grade in the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. In commensurate spirit,Crowley used his authority from Mathers to initiate in partibus and founded anew magical order—the Lamp of Invisible Light (LIL)—in Guanajuato with Medina asits first Imperator.19 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts019] Prior tohis Enochian visions—in October 1900—the mysteries of LIL had revealedthemselves to Crowley, and indeed the name of this order seems influenced bythose Enochian visions, as LIL is the name ascribed by Dee to the first, orhighest, Aethyr.20 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts020] The order setup a perpetual flame that was invoked daily with appropriate elemental,planetary, and zodiacal forces to make it a center of light and enlightenment.The letters LPD represented its philosophical, scientific, and moral principles:liberty, power, duty; light, proportion, density; law, principle, droit.Naturally, these letters also had other secret meanings. Unfortunately,Crowley’s interest in ceremonial magick waned shortly thereafter, and he droppedout of touch with Medina; the fate of LIL is unknown.21[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts021]Eckenstein joined Crowley in Mexico in December 1900, taunting him for wastingtime on poetry and occultism when he could be climbing. Nevertheless, Crowleyconfided in him that after searching so long for the truth, he was troubled tofind dramatic ritual dissatisfying. Fully expecting some belittling jibe, hisfriend’s thoughtful reply jolted him. “Do you know what your problem is? You’reunable to control your thoughts. You’re scattered, and you waste energy. Youhave to learn how to concentrate.” This comment struck Crowley with such clarityand truth that he wondered whether Eckenstein was a master in disguise. Herecalled, back at Wastdale Head, begging the gods to send him a tutor; instead,he began to suspect, they sent two: Baker and Eckenstein.Although the mountaineer considered himself no master, he devised a course ofstudy for Crowley. His instructions on concentration involved visualizingobjects, beginning with simple forms and advancing with practice to morecomplicated ones, such as moving objects or human beings. He also assignedsimilar tasks for the other senses. Eckenstein monitored and commented onCrowley’s progress, and when too zealously pursued, told him when to back off,22[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts022] which they did by mountainclimbing.At that time, there was scarcely any published account of previous climbs inMexico. Furthermore, the locals had little interest in the mountains aroundthem. The exception was geologist Ezequiel Ordóñez (1867–1950) of the StateGeological Survey, after whom the rhyolite crystal Ordóñezite is named and whowould later that year discover the first petroleum deposits in Mexico. He hadwritten extensively on the mountains and volcanoes of Mexico23[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts023] and, having climbed many ofthem, facilitated Crowley and Eckenstein’s ascents.24[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts024]They began in January 1901 in the town of Amecameca, thirty-six miles southeastof Mexico City. It rested between the bases of two volcanoes. The first ofthese, Ixtacíhuatl, the White Lady of Mexico, was a triple-peaked extinctvolcano rising to Ixtacíhuatl (17,343 feet) and is the only Central Americanmountain with a permanent glacier. Its neighbor, Popocatépetl (17,802 feet), wasan active volcano with a crater half a mile wide. Requiring a couple of good menwith mules, they met with the jefe politico or mayor of Amecameca, courted himwith cigars and liquor, and explained their intent to climb Ixtacíhuatl. Afterfour days’ negotiation, he agreed to help.Eckenstein and Crowley found only sketchy and dubious records of previousascents, and concluded Ixtacíhuatl had never been fully explored. The warning ofI. R. Whitehouse, the previous person to attempt a climb, that “I doubt if itwould be possible to reach the summit or summits by any other route than the onewe took, as on all sides, as far as I could discover, there were sheer ice wallsand precipices,”25 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts025] only enticed,rather than dissuaded, them. Unsure what to expect, they cautiously began on itslower slopes. The sun was relentless, and nowhere did they encounter the streamsthey expected to find running down from the glacier. Dehydration threatened, butthey finally located a spring, checked their provisions, and prepared to finishthe climb. Setting up camp at 15,807 feet, they spent the next three weeksscaling the White Lady’s slopes from every side.On January 19, they ascended the icy summit of Panza, the central summit ofIxtacihuatl, from the east-northeast, overcoming a 220-foot rock wall along theway. On the 24th they crossed “some of the worst walking we had everencountered”26 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts026] to the snowynorthern summit of Cabeza (16,883 feet); its flat snowy surface concealed gapsbetween giant hunks of ice which had fallen from an avalanche, so that somesteps fell on solid ice while others sank into deep pits of snow. On the 28ththey tackled Panza from a different approach.27[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts027] The north ridge of Panza wasIxtacíhuatl’s great challenge: its shadow kept the area bitterly cold, withfrostbite a serious threat; and the ridge’s seventy-foot ice wall rose at asteep incline of fifty-one degrees, and was so rotten that the surface iceneeded to be chopped away before their crampons could find a satisfactory hold.Nevertheless, they managed to ascend at a rate Crowley says “beat the record forsimilar altitudes very easily.”28[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts028] Eckenstein reported this ascentas 2,687 feet in two hours at the lower altitudes, and 907 feet per hour(including stops) between altitudes of 13,717 and 17,343 feet.29[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts029] By the last three days of theclimb, the intrepid adventurers were living on nothing but champagne and Danishbutter. This was not uncommon among mountain climbers, as the body expended somuch energy both climbing and staying warm that maintaining one’s weight wasfrequently a challenge.Returning to Amecameca in understandably high spirits, they sought the jefepolitico for a celebration, only to find a dour official. He regretfullyinformed them of Queen Victoria’s death on January 22. To his surprise, the pairshouted for joy and broke into dance. Later, Crowley explained, “To us, QueenVictoria was sheer suffocation.”30[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts030]They next rode nineteen hours by rail to Guadalajara, followed by another twodays to Zapotlán, the town nearest where the Sierra Madre and a chain ofvolcanic mountains converged. Here they found more peaks to conquer, includingthe Nevado de Colima with its two summits of 14,239 feet (southwest) and 14,039feet (northeast); and its neighbor to the south, the Colima volcano (14,206feet), the most active and dangerous volcano on the continent. Three days’ roughtraveling from Zapotlán took them to the horseshoe-shaped ridge at the base ofthe Nevado de Colima, where they struck camp. On March 3 they tackled the twinpeaks: the first was an easy scramble and climb, and they were evidently thefirst ever to reach the top; the higher southwestern summit was even easier, andthey could tell it had been climbed before.Next, they hacked and marched their way through the forest toward Volcán diColima for two days until, twelve miles from their destination, the volcanoerupted. Its hot ash, carried by the wind, landed on them and burned throughtheir clothes. They camped on the crest of a ridge directly north of the volcanoand observed over a dozen eruptions over the course of twenty-four hours.Approach was impossible; as Eckenstein wrote, “it presented the cheerfulalternatives of death by bombardment or by cremation.”31[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts031] So Crowley and Eckenstein madethe most of the situation by climbing the neighboring mountain and watching thevolcano for a pattern in its eruptions. After a week’s vigil, they detected nopattern whatsoever and decided to take their chances and begin climbing thepeak. The futility of their attempt soon became clear when the soles of theirboots burned through.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_016_r1.jpg]Volcán di Colima (14,206 feet) ten seconds after erupting at 4 p.m. on March 7,1901. (photo credit 4.2) [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c04-fig002a]Eckenstein and Crowley’s next goal was Citlaltépetl (Pico de Orizaba), locatedin Veracruz on the Gulf of Mexico. At 18,491 feet, its inactive volcanic peakwas the highest point in Mexico and the third highest in North America.Setting out from Mexico City on April 3, they arrived in Chalchicomula to findfurther transport impossible due to local saints’ days for the next five days.Facing what, even at this distance, was obviously an easy scramble, the pairgave up. Crowley bitterly watched vultures swoop about the landscape:Dim goes the sun down there behind the tallAnd mighty crest of Orizaba’s snow:Here, gathering at the nightfall, to and fro,Fat vultures, foul and carrion, flap, and callTheir ghastly comrades to the dome’d wallThat crowns the grey cathedral. There they go—The parasites of death, decay and woe,Gorged with the day’s indecent festival.32[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts032]They next traveled from Mexico City to Toluca, and from there to Calimaya, thecity nearest the inactive volcano Nevado de Toluca (also known as Xinantécatl orCinantécatl, 15,354 feet), whose crater was the basin for lakes of melting snow.This was the site of their camp; from here, it was difficult to tell which ofthe two most visible peaks on the ridge of the crater was tallest: Pico delFraile (the Friar’s Peak) or El Espinazo del Diablo (the Devil’s Backbone), sothey climbed both. On April 10 they scaled Pico del Fraile; Eckenstein was sickthe next morning,33 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts033] so Crowleyascended El Espinazo alone.While the mountaineers puzzled out an ascent of Volcán di Colima, Kegan Paul,Trench, Trübner and Company prepared Crowley’s next opus, The Soul of Osiris. Itwas the second half of The Mother’s Tragedy, which was so long that Kegan Paulhad suggested splitting it into two separate works. It appeared on March 7 in anedition of five hundred copies, plus six on India paper. The book garnered mixedreviews. The Westminster Review wrote, “it cannot be denied that AleisterCrowley is a true poet—a poet of the school of Baudelaire and Poe.”34[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts034] Most notable was byup-and-coming writer G. K. Chesterton (1874–1936), who wrote in the June 18Daily Mail:We have all possible respect for Mr. Crowley’s religious symbols and we do notobject to his calling upon Shu at any hour of the night. Only it would beunreasonable of him to complain if his religious exercises were generallymistaken for an effort to drive away cats.…If Mr. Crowley and the new mystics think for one moment that an Egyptian desertis more mystic than an English meadow, that a palm tree is more poetic than aSussex beech, that a broken temple of Osiris is more supernatural than a BaptistChapel in Brixton, then they are sectarians … But Mr. Crowley is a strong andgenuine poet, and we have little doubt that he will work up from hisappreciation of the Temple of Osiris to that loftier and wider work of the humanimagination, the appreciation of the Brixton Chapel.35[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts035]Despite Chesterton’s ideological reservations, it was proof that even theAtlantic Ocean was not wide enough to stop the flow of Crowley works.Crowley and Eckenstein began their final Mexican climb on April 17. However, theroute up the second highest peak in Mexico, Popocatépetl (17,802 feet), wasactually more like “walking up very objectionable scree, or rather volcanicdebris, lying at practically the critical angle.”36[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts036] The mountain’s claim to fame wasthat its ascent in 1521 by Francisco Montaño was arguably the earliest record ofany high ascent on a mountain. On their climb 380 years later, Eckenstein andCrowley brought along a Chicago-based newspaper writer who reported the climb ashis syndicated alter ego, “Mr. Dooley,” who commented humorously on politicaland social issues in a thick Irish accent (written phonetically). While neitherCrowley nor Eckenstein identify this writer, “Mr. Dooley” wass the immenselypopular creation of Finley Peter Dunne (1867–1936); his article “Mr. DooleyClimbs Popo” recounted his adventures with “me former counthrymon, theShivvyleer O’Rourke, an’ his parthner-in-crime, Bar-ron von Eckenstein.”37[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts037] Greeting the climbers on thislast adventure was an amazing display of nieves penitentes, formations of iceflakes that were two to four feet high and up to eighteen inches thick, runningdiagonally in parallel rows up the mountain over several acres.Eckenstein left Mexico on April 20, bound for England to arrange an expeditionthat, if successful, would place them in the history books.When Allan Bennett left London, so did Crowley. Likewise when Eckenstein leftMexico, Crowley did too. After nine months of Mexico he prepared to visit GDalumni Elaine Simpson and Allan Bennett in Asia. On April 22 he journeyed to SanFrancisco, where he spent a week. The Bay City for him was “rank and gross,without a touch of subtlety.”38 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts038]On May 3, he set sail for Honolulu on the Nippon Maru. Having solemnly pledgedto pursue magic again, he passed the voyage honing his concentration skills. Hisdiaries from this period show a strong influence of Theosophy: his May 8 entrymentions Adyar-Theosophy’s cofounder Bishop Charles Webster Leadbeater(1854–1934), and elsewhere he writes of his determination to look up the localTheosophists. He landed in Hawaii on May 9, noting this was also “White LotusDay,” in honor of TS founder H. P. Blavatsky (1831–1891). In actuality, thecommemoration of Blavatsky’s death was a day earlier, May 8.Waikiki Beach became, for a month, the center of Crowley’s outpourings,immortalized in “On Waikiki Beach.”39[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts039] He also wrote Book One ofOrpheus (1905)—which he dedicated to Eckenstein. “What a hell scene I canwrite,” he reported eagerly to Gerald Kelly. “You wait.”40[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts040]On May 10, he met Mary Alice Rogers (née Beaton)41[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts041] of Salt Lake City at his hotel.Of Scottish descent, she was ten years older than Crowley and married to alawyer. She had come to Honolulu with her thirteen-year-old son, Blaine, toescape hay fever. The boy was bright and intelligent, yet, to Crowley’sastonishment knew no language other than English and was equally unskilled inmath, history, and geography. He thought it criminal that school provided nogrist for such a bright child’s mill.42[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts042] Mary was one of the sweetest,most beautiful women Crowley had ever known. From the beginning, he calculatedan affair and breakup with her to inspire his poetic muse; this premeditation isevident in his diaries where, early on, he begins referring to her as “Alice,”the pseudonym to which Crowley would ultimately address a series of love poemscollectively titled Alice: An Adultery (1903). All the while he mused how absurdit was for him to come all the way to Hawaii “only to fall in love with a whitewoman.”43 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts043]Crowley convinced her to accompany him to Japan. With boy in tow, they sailed onthe American Maru. On the thirteenth day of their acquaintance, they kissed forthe first time, his diary noting that he “told her I loved her; kissed and waskissed.”44 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts044] Still, therelationship advanced at a slower pace than Crowley preferred. On May 23, hisdiary reads, “Kissing all evening.… All this should prepare a superb Eurydicelament when we part.” Two days later, he entered in his diary, “Promised not todo anything against her will, so we lay together about an hour on my bedkissing.” He dismantled the temple in his cabin the next day: “Took down myshrine.… The ‘affaire’ seems designed by the devil to take up maximum of timeand virility.”45 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts045] All the whilehe promised himself,Another month to be a man,Another month to kiss her and be kissed,And then—all time to Magic and to Art!46[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts046]They wrestled with guilt—“The silly ‘Thus far and no farther,’ ”—but appetiteovercame chastity, and the affair commenced. Even as it did, Crowley confided inhis journal, “don’t much care what happens really. Love is good, but so isfreedom.”47 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts047] Mary was equallyconflicted about her infidelity. Some nights she locked her cabin door andrefused to see Crowley; on others, she accommodated him. Before the month wasover, their relationship ended. On June 29, 1901, Crowley noted in his diary,“Finished with that foolishness. Alice sailed at noon. Thirty-eight days fromwhen we kissed all wasted—or all rest.” Thus, he was free to chase after magicand art in Shanghai while she rejoined her home and husband in Utah. Crowleysummarized, in much kinder terms than his diary’s, this liaison in a letter toGerald Kelly:We loved, and loved chastely.On the boat we fell to fucking, of course, but—here’s the miracle!—we wonthrough and fought our way back to chastity and far deeper, truer love.48[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts048]The fifty days between their meeting and parting inspired Crowley to commemoratetheir relationship in a series of fifty sonnets, one for each of those days. Thebook Alice: An Adultery (1903) testifies to the most puzzling aspect ofCrowley’s relationships: when he loved, he did so with his whole being, but thepassion was typically short-lived. Like the prototypical double-ended candle,his emotions burned more fiercely, and his losses seemed twice as dark. Heexpressed his anguish over losing this forbidden paramour in another poem fromthis period:“I am so faint for utter love I sigh and long to die.”49[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts049]Despite his heartache, Crowley, as ever, found in the encounter the energy andinspiration for new works: his thirty days as a man being up, he returneddutifully to magic and poetry, neither of which he had truly abandoned so muchas neglected during this time. Proofs for Tannhäuser awaited in a Hong Kong postoffice, and he continued writing “Book II” of Orpheus, which he dedicated toMary Beaton, “whom I lament.” In a letter to Kelly, Crowley described his stateof mind at the time: “my ideas are changing and fermenting. You will notrecognize my mind when I get back. I am calm and happy and thoroughly energeticat the same time.”50 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts050]By July, a new manuscript went into production. Despite slow sales of previousworks, he remained undaunted. The Mother’s Tragedy came out in an edition offive hundred copies. Press opinions were again divided on this volume: whileOxford Magazine wrote, “Mr. Crowley has a claim to recognition as a truepoet … Magnificent poems—pagan in their intensity and vividness of colouring,”the Athenaeum wrote, “If the reader can form a conception of a wind-bag foamingat the mouth, he will get some notion of ‘The Mother’s Tragedy,’ and other Poems(privately printed).”51 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts051] TheWestminster Review noted “The love of a man for his own mother, not according toa moral but a sexual standard, is not quite a novel idea, but Mr. Crowleyhandles the subject in a revolting fashion,” while The Academy noted thatCrowley “frequently expressed things with all his uncompromising completeness,which poetry (to our mind) had better leave unexpressed.”52[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts052]Back in April, while scaling mountains and volcanoes in Mexico, Crowley begancorresponding with Elaine Simpson. She had been his ally in the GD dispute, oneof the few members loyal to Mathers, and helped him seize headquarters. Inspiredby Mrs. Simpson’s accusation that Crowley had visited her daughter’s bedroom inastral form, they agreed to an experiment: every weekend they would visit eachother on the astral plane. Recording their results, their diaries could later becompared for accuracy. On April 17, the evening following Crowley andEckenstein’s return to Amecameca from Nevado de Toluca, it began. Crowleyvisualized himself traveling to Hong Kong, where she now lived, within an egg ofwhite light. In a green and white room, he met Fidelis, who dressed in a soft,white wool gown with velvet lapels. “Ave, Soror,” he greeted her in Latin, andconversed for a while. Thus it started.Even during his tryst with “Alice,” Elaine Simpson, the former Soror Fidelis,was on his mind. On May 19, 1901, his diary records a bad dream: “Broken imagesin my Shrine—reconciliation with [Florence Farr] Emery—some foulest sexualideas—& Fidelis running like a golden cord throughout.” Now proceeding toShanghai, Crowley’s thoughts were consumed with Simpson, whom he had visited onthe astral plane every Saturday evening for the past months. She was one of theonly people who could understand the psychological changes he was experiencing.And she could help him forget “Alice.”Meeting her a continent away from the Isis-Urania Temple, she looked just theway he remembered. Her place was also as he had pictured it; after all, he hadbeen there, in astral form. His vision had been correct in every detail, rightdown to the cloisonne vase he had tried lifting off the shelf with an invisiblehand. Nevertheless, she proved to be a disappointment. She had married the HongKong merchant Paul Harry Witkowski on May 8, 1900,53[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts053] and practically abandoned magic.And although he howled when he heard her tale of wearing her adept’s robes andregalia to a fancy dress ball and winning first prize, Crowley was disappointedto draw no compassion or inspiration from Fidelis.Disillusioned, he crossed Singapore and the southern coast of India en route tothe island Ceylon, the British colony known today as Sri Lanka. Arriving inCeylon’s capital, Colombo, on August 6, he saw firsthand how much the WhiteKnight thrived in his new environment. The climate improved his health,eradicating his wheezing and drug dependency. He was now the Bhikkhu AnandaMetteya, an aspiring Buddhist monk. Ceylon’s Solicitor General PonnambalamRámanáthan (1851–1930), also known as the orthodox Shaivite guru Sri Parananda,employed Bennett as a tutor for his children in exchange for instruction in yogaand Hinduism. As part of Ceylon’s Buddhist revival, Parananda allied withTheosophist Henry Steel Olcott (1832–1907) to advocate Buddhist education inschools. He also authored On Faith or Love of God and An Eastern Exposition ofthe Gospel of Jesus According to St. Mathew; the following year, he wouldcontinue the argument in his An Eastern Exposition of the Gospel of Jesusaccording to St. John that Christ was simply teaching yoga.54[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts054] His Biblical expositions werewell received, with Metaphysical Magazine writing “we know of no more deservingand practical Commentaries on the Holy Scriptures,” while The Theosophist calledtheir study “very interesting and very profitable”; interest in his writingswould eventually lead to an American teaching visit.55[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts055] Thus two mystical mentors,Bennett and Rámanáthan, gave Crowley “my first groundings in mystical theory andpractice.”56 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts056]His new environs—the Cinnamon Gardens, an affluent suburb of Colombo—inspiredthe poem “Dance of Shiva” and many of the other pieces that would appear inOracles (1905). He nevertheless felt ambivalent about Colombo, and by August 17he and Bennett moved about sixty miles northeast to Kandy, one of Ceylon’sprincipal cities, where they took a furnished bungalow surrounded by ancientpalaces and crypts, beautiful mountains and lakes, and Buddhist and Brahmantemples.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_017_r1.jpg]Sri Parananda, Ceylon’s solicitor general Ponnabalam Rámanáthan (1851–1930).(photo credit 4.3) [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c04-fig003a]Crowley busied himself with literary preparations. He wrote “Sonnet for aPicture,”57 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts057] and Kandy cropped upagain in Why Jesus Wept. He also finished revising Tannhäuser, wrote itsintroduction, and sent it to Kegan Paul, who produced five hundred copies tosell for five shillings apiece. Reviewers received it coldly, and even Bennettfound it obscure, long, and motiveless—comparing unfavorably to The Soul ofOsiris. Crowley typically considered it the pinnacle of his achievements up tothat point. “What the hell do you mean by a motive?” the crushed poet argued,heaping torrents of abuse upon his guru.Bennett explained that the piece lacked the literary transmigration of a moral.He clarified with an analogy: a moral is to a fable what a motive is to an epicpoem.With a scowl and hrumph, Crowley defended, “It’s the history of a soul: my soul;every soul; no soul!”“I ought to do yoga instead of exciting my favorite pupil to filthy andblasphemous language.”58 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts058]Crowley agreed, and proceeded to wrap up business so he could forget it. On theliterary front, he moved his next book, Carmen Sœculare, into production. Withrespect to climbing, he wrote to Eckenstein on August 23, placing £500 at hisdisposal for organizing their proposed expedition to climb a mountain higherthan anyone had climbed before. On August 28, 1901, Crowley commencedinstruction under Bennett, beginning with a ceremonial vow of silence for threedays to facilitate introspection. His studies involved yogic postures (asana),controlled breathing (pranayama), vocal repetition (mantra), concentration(dharana), and meditation. After two weeks of this discipline, the ascetic’slife proved too much, and Crowley disappeared for a week, doubtlessly in searchof women, alcohol, or some other diversion. At this time, AC sent Kelly atelling bit of advice on how to become a great painter:A slut for your mistress, a gamin for your model, a procuress for your landladyand a whore for your spiritual guide! That is the only way to become a greatartist!59 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts059]Crowley contended that asceticism’s major drawback was its failure to purgedistracting impulses. Rather than submerging these buoys in the subconscious,after which they inevitably surfaced with greater force than before, he favoredindulging and satiating his impulses, leaving his mind free from distraction.Thus, he returned from his hiatus prepared to immerse himself in study. Crowleydiligently pursued yogic discipline, his reward coming on October 3: after eighthours of breathing at a reduced rate of once a minute, he experienced the“Golden Dawn”:I became conscious of a shoreless space of darkness and a glow of crimsonathwart it. Deepening and brightening, scarred by dull bars of slate-blue cloudarose the Dawn of Dawns. In splendour not of earth and its mean sun, blood-red,rayless, adamant, it rose, it rose! Carried out of myself, I asked not “Who isthe Witness?” absorbed utterly in contemplation of so stupendous and somarvellous a fact.… And this, then, is Dhyana!60[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts060]In Book Four (1911), his classic text on yoga and magic, Crowley explained thetrance of dhyana in clearer language:In the course of our concentration we noticed that the contents of the mind atany moment consisted of two things, and no more: the Object, variable, and theSubject, invariable, or apparently so. By success in Dharana the object has beenmade as invariable as the subject.Now the result of this is that the two become one.… All the poetic faculties andall the emotional faculties are thrown into a sort of ecstasy by an occurrencewhich overthrows the mind, and makes the rest of life seem absolutely worthlessin comparison.61 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts061]Crowley received an update from Eckenstein in a letter of September 20 and acable of October 3. Crowley transferred another £500 to Eckenstein’s budget,bringing to £1,000—equivalent to roughly $42,000 by today’s standards—hiscommitment to the slowly developing venture. On October 12, at Kandy, he signeda formal agreement for the climb. They set their sights on Mt. Godwin Austen,the second highest mountain in the world. It was the highest point available toWesterners at the time, with Mount Everest remaining inaccessible and thereforeunclimbed by Europeans until 1921.Spiritual success drained Crowley, so the pupil and his teacher suspended workfor pilgrimages to Buddhism’s sacred cities. Their voyage began in Kandy, wherethey participated in Perahera, the annual celebration and circus in honor of thealleged tooth of Buddha—which Crowley was sure came from a dog or crocodile.“This celebration is no more Buddhist than the carnival at Nice isChristianity,” he mused, and shrugged his shoulders. “Io Pan!” However, thejovial display disillusioned Bennett, who believed sorrow to be the primaryhuman condition. They moved on to the Buddhist temple at Dambulla, Sri Lanka’slargest and best-preserved complex of cave temples with statues and paintings ofLord Buddha; Crowley called it “one of the most extraordinary works of humanskill, energy and enthusiasm in the world.”62[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts062] Sticking up above the jungle,the unclimbable Rock of Sigiri distracted Crowley, who determined to climb ituntil he realized that approaching it required cutting through miles of densefoliage. Thwarted, he instead wrote the poem “Anima Lunae”63[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts063] about King Zohra’s encounterwith the spirit of the moon.Stopping by a shallow lake, Crowley and Bennett spotted two cows and a bull.Much to the ascetic’s dismay, Crowley reached for his Mauser .303 rifle, andbegan a stealthy approach to this big game. When he got within one hundredyards, the bull suddenly stampeded toward him. Crowley acted quickly and,without thinking, raised his rifle, hastily aimed, and fired. But nothinghappened. The cartridge didn’t explode. “Balls!” he muttered under his breath asthe bull charged up. It ran right past Crowley and off into the distance.Luckily it fled rather than gore the intruder. Crowley was dumbfounded. “Noquestion about it,” he snorted. “I need a double-barreled rifle.”The pair journeyed north by coach through desolate, monotonous plains ofvegetation to Anuradhapura, one of Ceylon’s ancient capitals. This city wasimportant to the history of Buddhism, being the place where the Ceylonese rulerconverted around 250 BC; it was also the place Crowley wrote “The House,”64[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts064] based on a recurring anxietydream that Bennett was having about a house on a moor on a dark and stormynight.By mid-November the magicians parted ways. Bennett pursued the ascetic life of aBuddhist monk, not in Ceylon “where the sodden corruption of the Sangha sickenedhis sincerity,”65 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts065] but in Akyab(today called Sitwe), the port and chief city on the western coast of Burma,where he took the yellow robe at the Lamma Sayadaw Kyoung monastery. Crowley,more interested in Hinduism, pressed on to Madura in southern mainland India, enroute to the Himalayas. Here he determined to see the enormous rock temples thatwere forbidden to Europeans. Taking a leaf from his idol Sir Richard Burton,Crowley went incognito by donning a loincloth and begging bowl. He fooled noone, but the authorities, moved by the Englishman’s sincerity, permitted himentrance to some shrines, where he sacrificed a goat to the goddess Bhavani.On November 16 and 17, Browning’s poems “Christmas Eve” and “Easter Day”inspired Crowley to write “Ascension Day” and “Pentecost.” Crowley usedBrowning’s work as a stylistic model to express the philosophical issues he’dbeen wrestling with in magic, Christianity, Buddhism, and Hinduism. Despite theweighty and serious issues explored, Crowley did so in a highly mercurial way,lacing his work with wordplay and puns. His whimsy also expressed itself byfinding good rhymes for seemingly impossible words such as courtesan, Euripides,and Abramelin. These and other pieces written at this time would become TheSword of Song (1904).Crowley continued to the temple of the Shivalingam and the “sleepy, sticky andprovincial” city of Madras (now Chennai)66[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts066] before a bout of malaria laidhim up in Calcutta in January 1902. He befriended and stayed with two fellowWesterners: Harry Lambe, an Anglo-Indian whose friendship with Crowley was basedon twelve hours’ previous association, and Edward Thornton, an artist who alwayscarried a sketch pad and kukuri knife at his side. In his convalescence, Crowleyunsuccessfully tried to learn Hindustani and Balti in order to act asinterpreter on the Himalayan expedition. On January 8 he attended as a guest themonthly meeting of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, at which he heard the papers“On Trilokanatha in the Kanda Valley,” “On the Secret Words of the Çuluas,” and“On the Organization of Caste by Ballala Sen.”67[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts067] Around January 14, Crowley tiredof the study of Vedanta and Hinduism, yearning again for Buddhism and AllanBennett. Two months after they parted, it appeared that a reunion was in order.On January 21, 1902, a healthy Crowley set off to rejoin his Buddhist friend,with Thornton as his companion. The most direct route to Akyab required him tosail from Calcutta to Rangoon and cross the Arakan range. Crowley’s malariaflared up again in Rangoon, leaving him to live on quinine and iced champagne.Crowley adopted a passive attitude toward his condition, no longer caringwhether he recovered or died. He merely subsisted, and thereby acquired a newsympathy for Allan. Pressing ahead on January 25, they journeyed 150 miles northto Prome, Burma, where they hired a thirty-five-foot boat and sailed towardAkyab. Crowley, still sick with malaria, sat at the stern, rifle in hand,shooting at everything in sight.He finally reached the Lamma Sayadaw Kyoung monastery in Akyab at 8 o’clock onthe evening of February 14. Fortunately, the first man he encountered took himby carriage to the monastery, where he found Bennett in his bungalow, entranced,rigid, and sitting on his head like an overturned statue; his breathingexercises apparently caused his body to involuntarily leap into the air while inlotus position, landing the oblivious yogi on his head. Otherwise, he was thesame old gentle Allan, a giant among his diminutive Burmese fratres. Refreshed,Crowley wrote the poem “Sabbé Pi Dukkham”68[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts068] (Pali, “All is sorrow”) thatnight. Allan found Aleister’s enthusiasm for the Buddhist faith refreshing,spending days discussing how best to spread Buddhism into Europe. Following his1902 ordination as a Bhikkhu into the Theravada tradition—he was only the secondEnglishman so recognized—he would found the Buddhasasana Samagama, orInternational Buddhist Society, and begin publishing Buddhism: An IllustratedQuarterly Review, with six issues appearing between 1903 and 1908. Allan wouldthen return to England, carrying on his work there as a Buddhist missionary andserving as one of the key figures responsible for Buddhism’s spread into theWest.Like the other exotic locations of his journey, Akyab inspired the poet inCrowley. Under its spell, he wrote “Ahab” and began working on “The Argonauts”and Book III of Orpheus. All these pieces show the residue of his studies inHinduism and Shaivite mysticism. Crowley, reciting portions of his works to seehow they would read, was surprised by the potency of Orpheus.O triple form of darkness! Sombre splendour!Thou moon unseen of men! Thou huntress dread!Thou crowne’d demon of the crownless dead!O breasts of blood, too bitter and too tender!…I hear the whining of thy wolves!I hearThe howling of the hounds about thy formWho comest in the terror of thy storm,And night falls faster ere thine eyes appearGlittering through the mist.O face of woman unkissedSave by the dead whose love is taken ere they wist!Thee, thee I call! O dire one! O divine!69[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts069]As he recited this invocation of Hecate, he had a vision of her in the form ofBhavani, the goddess to whom he had sacrificed a goat in Madura. For the poet,Akyab’s magic was strong indeed.On February 23, Crowley bid farewell to the Bhikkhu and boarded the SSKapurthala. He had travelled a long distance not only physically but spirituallyas well. “I suppose by this time I may consider myself a pretty confirmedBuddhist,” he thought, “with merely a metaphysical hankering after the consolingdelusions of Vedanta.”70 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts070]Returning to Calcutta, he collected his mail and received the awaited news:Eckenstein’s Himalayan expedition was meeting in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, in lateMarch. Crowley passed the time until then writing: he composed “St. Patrick’sDay”71 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts071] on the 17th, andcompleted Book III of Orpheus the following day. Over March 20 and 21 he wrote“Crowleymas Day,” later published as Berashith (1903), taken from the first wordof Genesis. Subtitled “An Essay in Ontology,” it seeks to unite Christianity,Hinduism and Buddhism by subjecting their ontological beliefs to mathematicalanalysis.On March 23, he boarded a train for Rawalpindi. Coincidentally, Eckenstein andhis four men were heading to Rawalpindi on the same train, so Crowley joinedthem in their carriage for introductions.Guy Knowles (1879–1959) was a young climber who first visited the Alps in 1893,at age fourteen, where he scaled the Piz Roseg (12,917 feet) and other nearbymountains. His résumé included the Wetterhorn (12,113 feet) and Jungfrau (13,642feet) in 1895, and the Matterhorn (14,692 feet), Gabelhorn (13,330 feet), andWellenkuppe (12,805 feet) in 1896. In 1898, Eckenstein accompanied him onascents of the Weisshorn (14,780 feet), Lyskamm (14,852 feet), Dent Blanche(14,291 feet), and Matterhorn by the Zmutt arête.72[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts72] Although Crowley considered him,at age twenty-two, “far too young for work of this kind,”73[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts073] Eckenstein’s firsthandexperience with the climber convinced him otherwise; the fact that he was ableto help finance the expedition made up for any lack of mountaineeringexperience.74 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts074] Guy John FentonKnowles was the second son of Charles Julius Knowles and his wife Loyse (néeEssinger) of Kensington, who were friends with many English and French artistsof the era and patrons of painter and etcher Alphonse Legros (1837–1911). Theystarted Guy in art collecting while he was still a schoolboy at Rugby,introduced him to Rodin in Paris (Rodin gifted him with the first bronze castmade of his sculpture Sœur et frère), and even arranged for Legros to give Guylessons in drawing and sculpting. He matriculated to Trinity College in June1898, just missing Crowley; dividing his time between engineering, rowing, andthe Fitzwilliam museum (where he said he passed many of the most profitable andenjoyable quieter hours of his undergraduate life), he took a Second Class inPart I of the Mechanical Sciences Tripos, receiving his BA in 1901, the yearbefore the K2 expedition.75 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts075]Crowley found him cheerful and willing to follow directions, “the best companionI could have wished.”76 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts076]Dr. Heinrich Pfannl (1870–1929) was at age thirty-one the best rock climber inAustria, having climbed extensively on the Swiss, Ennstal, and Julian Alps.Indeed, he would in later years become the president of the Austrian AlpineClub. Born in Trumau, Lower Austria, he studied law in Vienna, received hisDoctor of Laws in 1894, and in 1896 passed the exam to become an Austrian judge.In 1894, at age twenty-four, he began hiking and climbing as a spiritual retreatfrom the covetous, acquisitive world of law and lawyers; for him, climbing was away to fulfill his will, of playing on death’s own border, where the only lawswere those of nature.77 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts077] Thus inMarch 1896, when his brother Josef, also a climber, was one of three killed inan avalanche on Lower Austria’s Rax mountain over the Reistalersteig, it did notdissuade Heinrich from climbing: the same year, he made the first ascent of theHochtor (7,772 feet) from the north, considered at that time impossible. Hedeveloped a reputation for his systematic approach and guideless climbs, givinghim much in common with Eckenstein’s methodical and antiestablishment ways.Pfannl made a guideless ascent of Mont Blanc (15,404 feet), the highest Alpinemountain, in 1899. In 1900, he recorded an ascent of Aiguille de Triolet and thefirst free climb of Dent du Géant (or Dent del Gigante, the Giant’s Tooth,13,165 feet), and in 1901 conquered the northern face of the Reichstein inAustria’s Ennstal Alps.78 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts078]“Superb climber as he was,” Crowley noted, “he was totally incapable ofrealising the magnitude of the task we had set out to perform.”79[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts079][images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_018_r1.jpg]Dr. Heinrich Pfannl (1870–1929).

(photo credit 4.5)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c04-fig005a]His regular climbing companion was Austrian barrister Dr. Victor Wessely (bornc. 1870) of Linz. Wessely, Hans Lorenz, and W. Merz were the first to ascend theDolomite rock ridge Langkofelkarspitze (9,268 feet) in 1892.80[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts080] He was Pfannl’s frequentclimbing partner, joining him, for example, on his 1896 first ascent of theHochtor-Norwand (7,861 feet), and his 1899 ascent of Mont Blanc; on December 27,1900, the two of them climbed the Hoch Arn (10,676 feet) in snowshoes.81[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts081] Crowley found him myopic (he wasthe only one in the party who wore glasses), and was revolted by his eatinghabits, which he likened to hunching over a plate and shoveling food into one’smouth. Perhaps in response to this unflattering characterization, Wessely, inhis account of the expedition, fails to mention Crowley at all.82[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts082]Doctor Jules Jacot-Guillarmod (1868–1925) acted as the expedition’s physicianand photographer; since the purpose of the expedition was ostensibly todetermine the effect of prolonged exposure to rarefied air on mountainclimbers,83 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts083] his professionalacumen was vital to the mission. Born in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, onChristmas Eve 1868, he was one of four children to Jules (a prominent professor,wildlife painter, and art teacher) and Adèle Emma Courvoisier. From 1888 to1897, he studied medicine in Lausanne and Zürich, obtaining his PhD and workingas a general physician in Corsier, Geneva, from 1898 to 1902. During his studiesin Zürich, he became acquainted with the mountains of central Switzerland anddeveloped passions for both climbing and photography. He climbed every year from1891 through 1901, and is best known for his ascent of Mont Blanc, which he andseveral doctor colleagues climbed without a guide on June 12, 1897. Otherguideless ascents that year included Mont Chemin (5,774 feet), Cornettes de Bise(7,979 feet), Col d’Emaney (8,077 feet), the Dom (14,911 feet), Col de Fenêtre(7,365 feet), La Ruinette (12,713 feet), Col du Mont Rouge (10,961 feet), Col deSeilon (10,499 feet), Pas de Chèvres (9,354 feet), Col des Maisons Blanches(11,240 feet), Pointe du Mountet (12,720 feet), and Monte Rosa (15,203 feet).84[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts084] In 1890 he joined the Diableretssection of the Swiss Alpine Club, the French Alpine Club in 1898, and in 1899 hebecame a senior member of the Academic Alpine Club of Zurich.85[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts085] Aged thirty-three, his climbingskills were, in Crowley’s opinion, marginal, but his congenial nature didwonders for morale. Crowley described him as “certainly worth his place in theparty, and more, for his constant cheerfulness and the fun we could always havewith him.”86 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts086][images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_019_r1.jpg]The K2 party (from left to right): Victor Wessely, Oscar Eckenstein, JulesJacot-Guillarmod, Aleister Crowley, Heinrich Pfannl, and Guy Knowles. (photocredit 4.6) [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c04-fig006a]Towering over the Karakoram range north of India at a height of 28,251 feet, thesecond-highest mountain in the world was known variously as K2, Chogo Ri, MountGodwin Austen, and Dapsang. Its sheer walls of ice, jutting sharply out of thelandscape, were considered unclimbable. Despite Godwin Austen’snineteenth-century survey, Conway’s 1892 Karakoram expedition, and Freshfield’s1899 snow-aborted attempt, K2 and its surrounding mountains remained relativelyunexplored. Conway did ascend the lesser neighboring pinnacles Crystal Peak andPioneer Peak, but Eckenstein, who was in the expedition, knew the facts: CrystalPeak was a minor summit, nine thousand feet smaller than its neighbor K2, whilePioneer Peak was not even a peak but the top of a ridge whose summit Conwaycould not climb. He scorned the achievements on which the new president of theAlpine Club built his reputation, knowing he could do better with the fourclimbers he recruited, none of whom belonged to the club.On March 29, they set out with three tons of baggage, 150 porters, and seventeenekkas (two-wheeled carts drawn by horses, oxen, or similar animals), spendingthe night in Tret. The next morning, Crowley awoke to find a smartly dressedyoung man sitting attentively at his bedside. He was a police inspector sent todetain the expedition. Baffled, Crowley referred him to Eckenstein. Later thatmorning, Rawalpindi’s deputy commissioner told Crowley, “The rest of your partycan do as it pleases. Mr. Eckenstein, however, cannot enter Kashmir.”Eckenstein, fearing this complication would fatally delay the expedition, askedCrowley to lead them into Srinagar while he sorted things out. So, for the nextthree weeks, Crowley led the march toward the mountain.Pfannl trained constantly. As Crowley wrote, “After a fifteen-mile march hewould have a little tiffin, and then go off in the afternoon up the mountainsideto keep himself in condition!”87 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts087]He enjoyed marching ahead of the others and, when everyone caught up, proudlyannounced how many hours he had been waiting. Crowley was sure Pfannl would makehimself sick.Guillarmod, meanwhile, oversaw the cooks, trying to teach them a thing or twoabout preparing meals. He was good-humored, not even minding being the butt ofjokes. For this, the natives invented the saying Yahan Doctor Sahib tahaantamasha: “Where the Doctor Sahib is, there is amusement.”Eckenstein found himself accused of being a spy. Interpreting this as an attemptby his rival, Conway, to use his influence to interfere with their expedition,Eckenstein boldly went to Delhi and confronted the ranking British official: ifhe was blocked from Kashmir, he would go to the Daily Telegraph and exposeConway’s machinations. On April 22 a suddenly unimpeded Eckenstein caught up tohis comrades in Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir.88[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts088] An ancient city rich withpagodas and mosques, it offered very few familiar Western comforts; it remindedGuillarmod of Venice, but with a breathtaking mountain panorama visible fromvirtually every direction.89 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts089]On April 28 they proceeded north toward the Karakorams, daily hiring porters tocarry their gear. The government, in an effort to make amends for detainingEckenstein, provided additional food, porters, and permissions to aid theexpedition.90 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts090] Seventeen days’march brought them to Skardu, the capital of Baltistan, on May 14. Crossing theIndus river by ferry, they continued toward Askole. Then trouble began.While most of the world’s great peaks were populated near their bases, K2 wasnot: Askole, ten days from the mountain’s base, was the last village along theway. This meant carrying an extra twenty days’ provisions for everyone in thecaravan. Since a porter could carry thirty days’ rations at best, bringingenough provisions for the entire length of the expedition became a problem. Thesolution: They cut their baggage back to forty pounds per person, bought everypound of food in the valley, and hired every available man—about 250—to carryit. Crowley’s insistence on bringing along his library drove Eckenstein intouncharacteristic anger. The poet shrugged his shoulders and told Eckensteinflatly, “I would rather bear physical starvation than intellectual starvation.Either I take my books with me or I leave the expedition.”91[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts091]On June 5, ten days after arriving in Askole, the expedition proceeded in fourteams. Crowley set out first, followed a day later by Wessely and Pfannl, thenby Knowles and Guillarmod another day behind. Eckenstein planned to join themafter Crowley set up a base of operations on the glacier.Crowley’s team consisted of about twenty hand-picked porters, his library, and amobile farmyard of fifteen sheep, thirty goats, and various fowl. The hired helpwas trying: Baltis traveled for days to sneak into the porters’ pay line andexpect their ten cents without working. At nightfall, porters made off withsupplies. Through it all, AC tried to treat them fairly and on terms he believedtheir culture understood. When a porter tested his authority by straggling, heresponded by ignoring the offender until the end of the day, then humiliated himin front of his friends with a whipping.92[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts092] Conversely, when a Pathan portercheated a Kashmiri servant of his tattered clothing, Crowley mediated thedispute. He heard the evidence and conceded that, by native justice, the clothesbelonged to the Pathan. However, Crowley added a twist to the judgment:“Hassan’s coat certainly belongs to you, but the coat you are wearing belongs tome.” Thus Crowley dressed the servant in the new coat he had bought for each ofhis porters, while the bully slunk off in rags that were far too small for him.Finally, when he arrived at Paiyu’s open plateau on June 8 and discovered theservants had stolen his fowl and nearly all the sugar, he fired them all.According to Rowell,93 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts093] this wasonly the first of many expeditions to search in vain for competent high-altitudeporters in the Karakorams.Finally, on June 16—seventy-nine days after setting out from Pindi—Crowleygreeted the Baltoro Glacier with awe. Its wall of ice dwarfed the Swiss Alps,jutting over one thousand feet into the sky, and this from an altitude of 16,000feet. AC spent the next four hours marching where no one had set foot before. Atan altitude of 16,592 feet on the southeast ridge that would later be known asthe Abruzzi Ridge, Crowley set up Camp 8. His survey from this point indicatedthat the ridge was the best approach to the summit of K2. Subsequent expeditionswould confirm that Crowley lucked upon the best, and possibly only, way up K2.Crowley’s team proceeded up the south face of the mountain to 17,332 feet, wherethe glacier rose sharply. Not wishing to endanger his porters, Crowley set upCamp 9 and halted the group. He climbed another 1,400 feet alone to set up Camp10, the main camp, then sent his porters home and awaited the others.Pfannl and Wessely reached Camp 10 with their group on June 19. With theirarrival came the persistent snow that marred the expedition. While the weatherdidn’t keep Knowles, Guillarmod, and the rest of the third team from arrivingthe next day, it soon turned into a furious blizzard. A week passed beforeEckenstein could ascend with fresh meat and bread.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_020_r1.jpg]A view of Camp 10. (photo credit 4.7)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c04-fig007a]Eckenstein and Knowles were both ill, with Knowles showing signs of altitudesickness. So Crowley, Pfannl, and Guillarmod started up the mountain. High windskept them busy trying to keep their tents secure, and Crowley awoke the nextmorning with snow blindness. Wessely and Pfannl went ahead on July 1 to set upCamp 11 at 20,000 feet. They concluded K2 could be climbed not by the AbruzziRidge but by the northeast ridge, an unrealistic plan that Eckenstein vetoed.Snow fell for the next five days.The climbers soon found that, living on the mountain, their body temperature andweight made a depression in the ice beneath their tent, forming a spot for waterto collect and soak everything. On July 5, when two men arrived with two copiesof Tannhäuser from the publisher, Crowley wrote in his diary, “We wished theyhad been 2,000 as then we should have something dry to put tents on.”94[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts094] Crowley spent the next dayfloating paper boats in the small lake inside his tent. The snow and moistureearned this site the nickname “Camp Misery.”When Eckenstein proposed moving to Camp 11, Crowley objected strenuously,believing Abruzzi Ridge to be the best route up the mountain. Eckenstein fearedthe porters couldn’t manage the climb, so, on July 8, Crowley, Wessely, Pfannl,and Guillarmod moved to Camp 11, which Crowley dubbed Camp Despair, whileEckenstein and Knowles held back at Camp 10. Crowley went climbing the next day,reaching heights of 21,500 to 22,000 feet, only to relapse into illness on hisreturn. The next day, an avalanche showered Camps 10 and 11 with snow.Over the next days, Eckenstein and Knowles joined the others at Camp 11. Pfannland Wessely established Camp 12 at an estimated height of 21,000 feet.By July, K2 took its toll on the expedition: the weather was inhospitable, thealtitude beyond acclimation, and the strain debilitating. At this altitude,water boiled at 194 degrees Farenheit—eighteen degrees lower than normal; ittook two hours to make lukewarm tea, and the whole day to boil mutton. Knowleslost thirty-three pounds, and Guillarmod dropped down to 147; both wereconstantly ill with the flu. Crowley, meanwhile, was down with malaria. Lockedin his tent on the mountain, with a fever of 102.9 degrees, the magician workedon The Sword of Song. Later, delirious with fever, Crowley pulled his Coltrevolver on Knowles, who disarmed him with a sharp blow to the stomach. In lateryears, the gun would occupy Knowles’s mantel beside artworks of Degas, Rodin,Whistler, and Guardi.When news came down from Camp 12 that Pfannl was ill, the doctor took notice.Pfannl had suffered bronchitis on the Finsteraarhorn (14,022 feet) in 1898 andhad requried a period of convalescence at that time,95[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts095] so Jacot-Guillarmod monitoredhim closely. His condition worsened the next day, so the doctor examined him andbrought him back down to Camp 11. He had edema of both lungs, triggered by thehigh altitude. It was a common occurrence in mountaineering, but at that time,fluid in the lungs was usually diagnosed as pneumonia; the correct diagnosis isto Guillarmod’s credit.96 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts096] Onmorphine, Pfannl babbled incoherently and explained his illness to Crowley: “Theothers are brutes and cannot understand. But you are a poet, you can see. Thereare three of me: two are well, but the third is a mountain, which holds adagger. I am afraid it will stab me.” On July 21, after the latest snowstormpassed, Wessely took Pfannl down to Rdokass. Five days passed before the othersrealized Wessely had taken most of the emergency rations with him.On August 1 the Austrians sent word from Rdokass that a cholera epidemic hadbroken out in the Bralduh Nala valley, and that the government had sealed offtheir return route. Eckenstein and Knowles were alarmed. Forty-nine days afterCamp 10 was established, Eckenstein wrote to climber Douglas Freshfield(1845–1934):Since then, we’ve had eight partially fine days (no three consecutive) and therest of the time continuous snow storms. Our present storm has gone on for over96 hours, and shows as yet no sign of abatement. At our camp here there are overfive feet of fresh snow. Our prospects of ascending a high mountain, or anymountain, are consequently practically nil on this occasion.97[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts097]Crowley assessed the situation in very similar terms:Of the 68 days which I spent on the glacier, only eight were fine; it wasimpossible even to start on any serious climb, easy as the mountain was, judgedby the standard of technical difficulty. Pluck and perseverence are all verywell; but they make no impression on deep powdery snow. A novice and a coward toboot will do as well—or as badly—as the best climber in the world with thetemperament of Achilles.98 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts098]Perhaps more concisely, Crowley wrote these lines at Camp Despair:So now the Earl was well a-weary ofThe grievous folly of this wandering.99[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts099]At a long meeting the team evaluated their options. Their money was spent,everyone was sick, the snow was relentless, and a cholera epidemic threatened.Even if the weather miraculously cleared, the plateaux would require at least aweek before they could be climbed, and the team had only a fortnight’s suppliesto see them back to civilization. They decided unanimously to descend.They tore down Camp 11 on August 3 and began their descent the next day. On thelower Baltoro Glacier, which they found dry of snow, Crowley stopped near aspring and washed for the first time since they began; he was rewarded with ahead cold the next day. The team rejoined Pfannl and Wessely on August 11 inRdokass, where they were surprised to find their rations gone. Crowley raved,“there were no sheep, the Austrians having managed to eat eight in sixteen days,in addition to fowls, etc!”100 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts100]At another meeting the team expelled the two climbers.Alarmed by the cholera epidemic, Knowles and Eckenstein dumped the expedition’stea and other provisions into the river and left the region before they could beinfected. Neither Crowley nor Guillarmod bought into the panic and left theregion at a leisurely pace. On August 20, 1902, Crowley recorded, “My constantsorrow at having ever been born was interrupted by moments of something verylike indifference as to whether I was alive or not. It needed, in fact, a veryfew days to plunge me into the moral abyss of actually liking life.”101[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts101] On September 1 they arrived atGurais, where Crowley and Guillarmod enjoyed a hot bath and cooked food. OnSeptember 6 the two climbers continued to Srinagar and parted. One hundred andthirty-two days after it started, the world’s first expedition up K2 was over.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_021_r1.jpg]Crowley bathing in a spring on the lower Baltoro Glacier, 1902. (photo credit4.8) [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c04-fig008a]It is necessary to put this expedition into perspective because it is oftenoverlooked by historians. The oversight is intentional, because the team’s twoprincipals were very unpopular among Alpinists: Eckenstein disdained what heconsidered glory-grabbing tactics of the Alpine Club, so that Conway wasknighted while Eckenstein died in obscurity in 1921.102[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts102] Crowley, on the other hand,because of his colorful reputation, was too notorious to receive credit for anyachievement, however well deserved. Thus, many histories of K2 fail to mentionthis expedition at all; for instance, Sir Francis Younghusband’s (1863–1942)account103 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts103] merely states thatthe Swiss doctor, Jacot-Guillarmod, explored the region.So what did the team accomplish? While it did not reach the top of K2, it wasthe first to set foot on the mountain; only the weather prevented their reachingthe pinnacle. Even so, Guillarmod and Wessely performed reconnaissance up to23,000 feet, a Himalayan record.104[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts104] Guillarmod also performedscientific measurements, recording not only the daily high and low temperatures,but also the altitudes at which vegetation ended (13,500 feet), ibex ascended(16,000 feet), and jackdaws flew overhead (18,000 feet). Eckenstein pioneeredthe use of successive depots and camps for climbing the great mountains ofAsia.105 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts105] The expedition alsostayed on the glacier for sixty-eight days, living at an altitude of 20,000 feetfor longer than was thought possible; none but Knowles complained about the thinair. All this by a team of what some have called amateurs, using very primitiveequipment by today’s standards. It would be over fifty years before the partylead by Italian climber Professor Ardito Desio (1897–2001) became first to reachK2’s summit in 1954.From Srinagar, Crowley returned home by stages: first to Baramula, where hehunted bears for a week; then to Bombay, his ambition for sightseeing witheredby sickness and exhaustion. On October 4, he sailed for five days to Aden, whereYemini authorities quarantined him in case he had caught cholera in Bombay. Bythe time he reached Cairo on October 14, his ennui had swelled: he had been awayfrom London for sixteen months, climbing mountains, learning mysticism, andwriting poetry. Although he felt certain he had attained greatness in all threeareas, he found no comfort in the knowledge when pondering his next move. Ratherthan see the pyramids, Crowley visited Cairo’s flesh pots, muttering “I won’thave 40 centuries looking down on me.” On November 5, 1902, after three weeks inCairo, Crowley resumed life in France.He called on Mathers, who, in the process of moving to Butte Montmartre,received him warmly. Crowley eagerly described his journeys, only to find FraterSRMD uninterested in tales of mountaineering, concentration, and yoga.Disappointed with his master, he concluded they had grown apart. Moreover, hebelieved Mathers had lost contact with the Secret Chiefs, and with it anymystical power or authority he may have claimed."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVEA ROSE BY ANY OTHER NAMEWhile Crowley circled the globe, Gerald Kelly moved to Paris to become anartist. As early as 1900, William Dalton, principal of the Camberwell School ofArts and Crafts, had advised Rev. Kelly, “Let your son go to Paris; you’ll neverregret it.” Once he accepted the idea of his son being a painter, the clergymansupported Gerald’s endeavors. The budding artist arrived alone in Paris in 1901and took a studio on the rue Campagne-Première in Montparnasse. He rubbed elbowswith local luminaries like Monet, Degas, Rodin, and Renoir, finding himself aportrait painter, a realist, in the Impressionistic hotbed. At the urging of afriend, he reluctantly submitted his first two portraits—both of his sisterRose—to the Salon, where they were put on display. From there, he quickly gaineda reputation as a talented painter with an encyclopedic knowledge of art, and in1903 the French government bought one of his pictures. Gerald Kelly had arrived.So, too, did Crowley, who decided to stay with him.Crowley’s empty feeling about his achievements wilted into what he called his“cynical bonhomie” phase. He completed “Ahab” on December 9 and dedicated it toG. C. Jones, his mentor in the GD. From the manuscript, he printed the sonnet“New Year, 1903” in gold capital letters on a folded sheet with a crimsonborder. It bore the message, “From Aleister Crowley, wishing you a speedytermination of existence.” His next publication was an edition of two hundredcopies of Berashith, his first published work on magic. The Paris printing firmClarke & Bishop did the job.His nihilistic attitude emerged from a desire for the trance of nonexistence—ofunion with the godhead. This sentiment runs through his works from this period,including “Science and Buddhism,” “The Excluded Middle,” and his disenchantedtreatment of Buddhism, “Summa Spes”:Existence being sorrow,The cause of it desire.A merry tune I borrowTo light upon the lyre:If death destroy me quite,Then, I can not lament it;I’ve lived, kept life alight,And—damned if I repent it!Let me die in a ditch,Damnably drunk,Or lipping a punk,Or in bed with a bitch!I was ever a hog;Muck? I am one with it!Let me die like a dog;Die, and be done with it!This poem, like Berashith, appeared in early 1903, with Alice: An Adulteryfollowing it into production. He showed the manuscript of Alice to severalacquaintances, one of whom was aspiring artist Sybil Meugens (born c. 1877), whowas helping to distribute his books.1[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts001] To Crowley’s surprise, both sheand Kelly claimed no lady would kiss her suitor so early as the thirteenth dayof his wooing. He felt vindicated when, shortly thereafter, Sybil’s lover wentto Brussels for a week and she became intimate with Kelly. The artist was, infact, so smitten that he proposed. Only a hasty visit from his sister Rose, whowarned him his allowance would be cut off if he went ahead with the marriage,caused him to wait. Eager to put a twist onto the situation, Crowley offered tomatch the allowance if Gerald were to go ahead and marry her. By then, thematter had degenerated to the point that Gerald reconsidered matrimonyaltogether.Meanwhile, Crowley found himself enamored of an Irish friend of Gerald’s fromthe Slade School of Fine Art, Eileen Gray (1878–1976). Kathleen Eileen MorayGray had come to Paris to study art at the Académie Julian and AcadémieColarossi, and she lived near Montparnasse. Kelly was painting her portrait, soshe spent a good deal of time in his studio, where she met Crowley. Somethingabout the poet with silk shirts, floppy bow ties, and ostentatious ringsappealed to her. Perhaps it was his sense of luxury, or his fashionable interestin occultism, or because she thought “he was very lonely.”2[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts002] For whatever reason, shepatiently sat and listened to his discourses on magic, while he denied Kelly’sassumption that they were lovers: “She was never anything of the sort, norwithin a million miles of it. Never wished it, nor she.”3[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts003] Regardless, Crowley soonproposed and gave her a diamond brooch.One day, while sitting for Kelly, Eileen asked about her intended. Reading inThe Sword of Song that Crowley had read Lévi and the cryptic Coptic, shewondered, “What does Coptic mean?” The painter told her, “It’s the languagespoken by the ancient Copts.” When she asked, “What does cryptic mean?” hestopped painting and smirked. “The language spoken by the ancient Crypts.”Much of Crowley’s writing from this period concerns his fiancée: In Rosa Mundiand Other Love Songs, poems 3, 14–16, 18, and 21–28 are all about Gray. Evenpoem 13 of the “Lover’s Alphabet” series is titled “Eileen.” In number 27, herfull name appears as an acrostic. Like Kelly’s hasty proposal to Sybil Meugens,Crowley’s marriage to Eileen Gray failed to materialize. Although Gray would goon to become a successful furniture designer and architect, the importance ofher reputation and contributions are only recently being appreciated: At aFebruary 25, 2009, auction from Yves Saint Laurent’s art collection, Gray’s“Fauteuil aux dragons” armchair sold for a record £19.4 million, the highestprice ever paid for a piece of twentieth-century design.4[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts004] Likewise, the Irish Timesquipped that 2009 “might be called The Year of Eileen Gray.”5[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts005]Another of Crowley’s works, “The Star and the Garter,” commemorated his entirecircle of women at the time: fiancée Eileen Gray was the star, while the garterwas three other ladies, most likely Kelly’s fiancée, Sybil Meugens; model NinaOlivier; and sculptress Kathleen Bruce. Olivier—of whom, as Crowley wrote, “Iloved and loved so well and sang so passionately”6[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts006]—would reappear in “The Ordeal ofIda Pendragon” and in Rodin in Rime, while Bruce, as will be seen, featured innumerous works.Kathleen Bruce (1878-1947)—born Edith Agnes Kathleen Bruce—was Eileen Gray’sclose friend. The youngest of eleven children, she was orphaned in infancy,raised in Edinburgh by a strict grand-uncle, and sent to an equally strictconvent school from age fourteen to eighteen. She became an art student at agetwenty-one and in 1901 began attending the Académie Colarossi in Paris. Startingwith paint—she loved the work of Augusts John—she soon discovered clay was hermedium. As a friend and pupil of Rodin, etched in her memory was the day shewent from being called chère élève (dear student) to chère collègue (dearcolleague). Within months of graduating with the Colarossi’s highest honors, hersculptures were displayed by the Salon.During a sitting, Kathleen Bruce’s Highland flamboyance and seductive beautycaptivated Crowley. Characterized by some biographers as a misogynist becausethe frailties of her female friends exasperated her, Bruce was not the easyconquest Crowley had hoped. “She took delight in getting married men away fromtheir wives,” Crowley wrote bitterly, and “initiated me into the torturingpleasures of algolagny on the spiritual plane.”7[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts007] Of their “sexless love,” Crowleyremarked that she “made me wonder, in fact, if the secret of puritanism was notto heighten the intensity of love by putting obstacles in its way.”8[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts008] As it turns out, she was simplyremaining chaste until she found Mr. Right: As she recalled her artist friendsand potential lovers in Paris, “I kept my goal, my star, firmly fixed. None ofthese was the right, the perfect father for my son.”9[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts009] Crowley’s later poems “The BlackMass,” “The Adept,” and “The Vampire” recount his ambivalence toward her withlines like:Spit in my face! I love you. Clench your fistsAnd beat me! Still, I love you. Let your eyesLike fiery opals or mad amethystsCurse me! I love you. Let your anger riseAnd your teeth tear bleeding bits of fleshOut of my body—kill me if you can!10[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts010]After she married Antarctic explorer Captain Robert Scott (1868–1912) in 1908,Crowley concluded he had always disliked her. Bruce bore her husband a son,Peter, in 1909; Scott and three others died tragically on his second Antarcticexpedition, two months after reaching the South Pole.Whatever Crowley’s feelings about her may have been, Kathleen Bruce neverthelesscommanded much attention in his writings: His later books Why Jesus Wept andRodin in Rime would bear dedications to Kathleen Bruce, as would his poems “TheMuse” and “Song”11 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts011] and the shortstory “The Vitriol Thrower.”12 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts012]The namesake of “The Ordeal of Ida Pendragon”13[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts013] was based in part on her, aswere the poems “Ovariotomy” and “The Gilt Mask.”14[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts014] Much of his later work Cloudswithout Water, although not overtly dedicated to her, was written in her memory.Near the Gare Montparnasse, a circle of artists and writers clustered into LeChat Blanc, a restaurant in rue d’Odessa with a reputation for excellent yetinexpensive food. The clique was closed, the same people dining nightly aroundthe horseshoe-shaped configuration of tables that claimed most of the firstfloor. Those outsiders who unwittingly visited the English, American, and Frenchpainters quickly found themselves unwelcome. Gerald Kelly was part of the “in”crowd at Le Chat Blanc, and introduced Crowley to the assorted personalities whofrequented it.One of these was a young doctor named Willie who aspired to be a writer.Although he had recently published Mrs. Craddock (1902)—and his first book, Lizaof Lambeth, in 1897—the name William Somerset Maugham (1874–1965) would notenter the ranks of literary greats for some years. Maugham was brother-in-law toone of Rose Kelly’s best friends, and through Gerald gained an introduction toLe Chat Blanc’s circle. Maugham was fond of Kelly, finding him talented,loquacious, and enthusiastic. When he wrote Of Human Bondage (1915), Maughambased the character Lawson on Kelly, creating a knowledgeable and aggressiveartist who says, “Raphael was only tolerable when he painted other people’spictures. When he painted Peruginos or Pinturichios he was charming; when hepainted Raphaels he was … Raphael.”15[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts015] Maugham, however, was not soimpressed with Crowley, writing of him:I took an immediate dislike to him, but he interested and amused me. He was agreat talker and he talked uncommonly well. In early youth, I was told, he wasextremely handsome, but when I knew him he had put on weight and his hair wasthinning. He had fine eyes and a way, whether natural or acquired I do not know,of so focusing them that, when he looked at you, he seemed to look behind you.He was a fake but not entirely a fake.… He was a liar and unbecomingly boastful,but the odd thing was that he had actually done some of the things he boastedof.16 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts016]Despite his reservations, Maugham admired the boastful yet worldly raconteur inCrowley enough to base the title characater of The Magician (1908), OliverHaddo, on Crowley. This unflattering parody—discussed later—is balanced by amore sympathetic portrait of him as Cronshaw in Of Human Bondage.17[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts017] Cronshaw was a poet, anextraordinary fellow and an excellent talker. He was at his best when drunk, buttaking “a devil of a time to get drunk.” Despite his worldliness—he kneweveryone worth knowing—he spoke French with an abominable accent. Stout but notfat, his round head was so small compared to the rest of his body that it“looked like a pea poised uneasily on an egg.” Maugham describes one incidentwhich is typically Crowley:“I wrote a poem yesterday.” Without being asked he began to recite it, veryslowly, marking the rhythm with an extended forefinger.18[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts018]Whether or not he liked Crowley, Maugham thought enough of him to portray hischaracter in two books.Another acquaintance was Marcel Schwob (1867–1905), French author, translatorand one of the great scholars of the nineteenth century. Although Schwobreputedly called Crowley “ridiculous and a bad poet,”19[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts019] the poet himself says Schwobcalled Alice: An Adultery a little masterpiece. Crowley considered him one ofhis best friends in Paris, and greatly admired him. Although Schwob was onlyeight years older than Crowley, he was quite sickly and would die two yearsafter their meeting, at age thirty-seven.Through Schwob, Crowley met novelist Arnold Bennett (1867–1931) and writer andpoet William Ernest Henley (1849–1903), both natives of England. Crowley hadread and admired Bennett’s recent The Grand Babylon Hotel (1902) and wassurprised to find Bennett somehow offended by his praise; he concluded Bennettwas “very ill at ease to find himself in Paris in polite society.”20[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts020] Henley—the original of RobertLouis Stephenson’s Long John Silver—was ailing from tuberculosis, butnevertheless invited Crowley to his house near Woking for a lunch of Chablis androast lamb. Crowley appreciated the consideration Henley showed to a youngunknown writer. He died three weeks after the visit, and Crowley recalled himfondly:And here his mighty and reverend high-priestBade me good cheer, an eager acolyte,Poured the high wine, unveiled the mystic feast …21[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts021]Best known for the poem “Invictus” (1875), Henley had several books of poetry,including A Book of Verses (1888), Poems (1898), Hawthorn and Lavender (1901), ASong of Speed (1903), and In Hospital (1903). However, the work that Crowleyadmired most was the one he edited with John Stephen Farmer: Slang and ItsAnalogues, Past and Present: A Dictionary, Historical and Comparative, of theHeterodox Speech of All Classes of Society for More than Three Hundred Years;with Synonyms in English, French, German, Italian, etc., was privately publishedin 1903 for subscribers only, and its catalog of vulgarities ceaselesslyentertained him.He also met Dr. Ivor Gordon Back (1879–1951), an observer and appreciator of thecircle of writers and artists. Crowley described him as a “great surgeon, andtrue gentleman.… Handsome as a god, with yet a spice of devil’s laughter lurkingthere, he would sit and enjoy the treasures of the conversation, adding at theproper interval his own rich quota of scholarly jest.”22[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts022] Like Crowley, his friendshipwith Kelly gained him an introduction to Maugham and the rest of the circle.British author Frank Arthur Swinnerton (1884–1982) remembered him as “solid anddark,” “a racy talker without illusions or moral refinement,” and possessing acurious habit: Whenever they met, the doctor would approach, point to his chest,and say, “Back. I met you at Willie Maugham’s,” even though Sinnerton had neverbeen to Maugham’s.23 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts023][images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_022_r1.jpg]Dr. Ivor Back (1873–1959). (photo credit 5.1)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c05-fig001a]Back was one of Crowley’s few Paris acquaintances with whom he continued afriendship after returning to England, dedicating In Residence: The Don’s Guideto Cambridge (1904) to him. Back was a proud descendant, through hisgrandmother, of the Duke of Wellington, to whom he bore a striking resemblance.Entering Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1898, he graduated with his BA in 1901,and when he met Crowley he was doing his clinical training at St. George’sHospital. As a colleague recalled,Ivor Back came to St. George’s from Cambridge with a great reputation as ananatomist, as those who attended his admirable demonstrations in thedissecting-room at St. George’s in his early days have good cause to remember.From the first he decided to become a surgeon and his desires came to fruitionby his early appointment to the surgical staff.24[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts024]He was also an avid Mason—whether he joined before or after meeting Crowley isunclear; he would go on to reach a high grade in Freemasonry and eventually bePast Master of the Lanesborough Lodge. His wide range of interests—includingliterature, criminology, and fly-fishing—earned him a reputation as a superbafter-dinner speaker. “Whenever one met him,” another colleague remembered,“there was the ever-ready spontaneous friendly smile and greeting which wouldbanish gloom and depression.”25 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts025]Crowley made various other acquaintances in the Le Chat Blanc circle. PainterEugène Carrière (1849–1906), recovering from an operation for throat cancer whenthey met, told him, “If it comes back, I shall kill myself.” Norwegian landscapepainter Frits Thaulow (1847–1906), whom he met several times, he recalled as a“jolly, bearded senior on whom life had left no scars.”26[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts026] Canadian painter James WilsonMorrice (1865–1924) was “invariably mellow drunk all day and all night.”27[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts027] And he would parody sculptorPaul Wayland Bartlett (1865–1925) in Snowdrops from a Curate’s Garden (1904) asa “brilliant but debauched sculptor, caustic of wit, though genial to hisfriends.”28 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts028]When Crowley met Auguste Rodin (1840–1917), the gray-haired, sixty-two-year-oldartist was being attacked for his sculpture of Balzac, which Crowley considered“the most interesting and important thing he did.”29[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts029] He was so impressed that hewrote a sonnet praising it:Giant, with iron secrecies ennighted,Cloaked, Balzac stands and sees. Immense disdain,Egyptian silence, mastery of pain,Gargantuan laughter, shake or still the ignitedStature of the Master, vivid.30 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts030]After returning unfulfilled from his world travels, he finally had a cause toget behind. Just as he fought for Mathers and Eckenstein, he now defended agreat artist from ignorant critics. Crowley presented his poem, along with asonnet titled “Rodin,” to the artist. Rodin read English no better than he spokeit, but based on reviews by his friends, Rodin gave them to Schwob totranslate.31 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts031] Schwob’s renderingof the laudatory poems, especially their “unexpected flower of violence, goodsense and irony,”32 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts032] pleasedRodin. The author published these poems privately as “Balzac: Hommage à AugusteRodin,” with eighteen copies on Japanese vellum and six on China paper. Theyalso appeared in Maîtres Artistes later that year, causing “a considerable stirin Paris.”33 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts033]Rodin invited his champion to stay with him at Meudon and write poetry about hisbest works. Crowley accepted, with many of the poems appearing in the WeeklyCritical Review, a bilingual periodical devoted to literature, music, and thefine arts edited by Arthur Bles and published in Paris from 1903 to 1904alongside contributions from luminaries like W. B. Yeats, Havelock Ellis, and H.G. Wells.34 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts034] When Crowley finallyleft Meudon, Rodin presented him with ten nude drawings, seven of which Crowleyused as illustrations when he published the poems four years later as SevenLithographs by Clot from the Watercolours of Auguste Rodin, with a Chaplet ofVerse (1907), also known as Rodin in Rime.By spring of 1903, Crowley tired of Paris and its provincialism andcliquishness. Wrapping up business, he completed The Sword of Song and left itwith Parisian printer Philippe Renouard on 19 rue des Saints-Pères for privatepublication. Then he sent copies of “Summa Spes” to his friends and returned toBoleskine for another go at the Abramelin operation.Back in Scotland, having decided against marrying Eileen Gray, Crowley put hisenergies instead into the Abramelin operation. An old family friend, L. C. R.Duncombe-Jewell, a.k.a. Ludovic Cameron, had come to Boleskine for a week’svisit but, according to Crowley, “managed somehow or other to settle down thereas my factor.”35 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts035] He was asportsman, poet, chess enthusiast, and advocate of the Cornish language; as aPlymouth Brother turned Catholic who wore a kilt and advised visitors to speakGaelic, he was a perfect fit for Crowley’s Highland home.Louis Charles Richard Jewell (1866–1947) was born on September 10, 1866, theeldest son of Richard and Mary Jewell of 112 Barras Street, Liskeard, Cornwall.His father was a bank manager, but later become an accountant and moved hisfamily first to 25 Granville Road, London, then to Beech Villa on Barrow Road,Streatham, just a few blocks from the Crowley and Bishop families.36[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts036] As Duncombe-Jewell recalled, “Ihave known Edward Alexander Crowley—which is his correct name, though he hasgone under many aliases—since he was a boy of 14: his mother and uncle havingbeen friends of my father and mother.”37[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts037] The friendship was natural,since the Jewell family were Plymouth Brethren; like Crowley, he was taught byprivate tutors.Jewell tried his father’s line of work but soon abandoned banking for writing,publishing in 1881 “a jejune railway novel.”38[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts038] In 1893 he began to write onforeign politics and military subjects (being a lieutenant in the 3rd VolunteerBattalion of the Royal Fusiliers), contributing successively to the St. Jame’sBudget, the Sketch, the Globe, Black and White, and the Pall Mall Gazette. InNovember 1895 he assumed the surname Duncombe in accordance with hisgrandmother’s will, and married Mary Amy Slaughter (1870–1904).39[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts039]Around the time of his marriage he edited The Royalist, a journal dealing withIrish and Welsh Jacobitism and Cornish identity. It was subsidized byCeltic-Cornish scholar and activist Henry Jenner (1848–1934). Both the magazineand Jenner were part of a larger Legitimist movement that sought dynasty changeby restoring to the throne Don Carlos VII of Spain and Charles XI of France,among others. Jenner and Duncombe-Jewell had a long acquaintance, and both wereactively involved in Legitimism.40[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts040] Ironically, Duncombe-Jewell wasalso Spanish correspondent to The Times (1898–1899), covering the Carlistuprising at the same time he was participating in it. Crowley too was involvedaround 1899; for instance, his poem Carmen Sæculare contains the Carlist verse:O piteous fallen tyranny of Spain!What dogs are tearing at thy bowels yet?Let thine own King, saith God, resume his reign!Loyal and happy seasons may forgetThe ancient scars. Thy moon is on the wane?Thy sun may never set!As Crowley elaborated in his Confessions:My cousin Gregor had made me a romantic Jacobite.… I actually joined aconspiracy on behalf of Don Carlos, obtained a commission to work a machine gun,took pains to make myself a first-class rifle shot and studied drill, tacticsand strategy. However, when the time came for the invasion of Spain, Don Carlosgot cold feet. The conspiracy was disclosed; and Lord Ashburnham’s yacht, whichwas running the arms, fell into the hands of the Spanish navy.41[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts041]Here Crowley refers to the June 17, 1899, seizure by the Spanish government ofLord Ashburnham’s British yacht Firefly off the coast of Arcachon in the Bay ofBiscay. Its crew of fifteen—including its commander, Thames Valley LegitimistClub Vice-Chairman and Royal Navy Lieutenant Vincent English—were arrested, andits cargo of 3,664 Chassepot rifles confiscated.42[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts042] According to Lowenna, not onlywere Jenner and Duncombe-Jewell involved in this foiled plot, but Crowleyhimself appears on the Firefly crew pay list for August 26, 1899, as “C.Alexander.”43 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts043] Although Crowley’sinvolvement in these activities appears, like many of his romantic fancies, tobe short-lived, he did receive a knighthood from one of Don Carlos’slieutenants.44 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts044]This, however, would not be Crowley’s only contact with Legitimism. Mathers wasalso a Jacobite, and was translating magical texts at the British Library duringthe time that Jenner was Keeper of Manuscripts. Indeed, Lowenna contends that itwas Mathers’s preoccupation with Legitimist politics in France that took hisfocus away from the GD and ultimately led to the London temple uprising.45[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts045] Lowenna reports that Crowley’sfriend, writer Herbert Vivian, was also connected to Lord Ashburnham.After the Firefly debacle, Duncombe-Jewell served as Morning Post warcorrespondent with the 3rd South African Field Company from 1899 to 1900,receiving the queen’s South Africa medal.46[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts046] However, love of his birthplace,Cornwall, dictated the majority of his activities at this time. As early asApril 1901 he appears in Celtia magazine as a contributor to the Pan-CelticCongress;47 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts047] by the August issue,he announced, “I shall attempt to found a Cornish Language Society a part ofwhose programme will be the revival of the Miracle Plays in the language.”48[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts048] He founded the Celtic-CornishSociety (or Cowethas Kelto-Kernuak) on August 15, 1901, with Henry Jenner as oneof its vice presidents and himself as honorary secretary.49[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts049] At the Pan-Celtic Congress thatmonth, he proposed the recognition of Cornwall as a Celtic nation,50[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts050] and in October published thefirst sonnet in Cornish.51 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts051]Alas, misfortune soon surrounded Duncombe-Jewell. His “disastrous personalfinancial situation led to his dismissal in the summer of 1902” from a projectedVictoria History of Cornwall.52 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts052]That November, a clearly preoccupied Duncombe-Jewell visited W. B. Yeats andasked Annie Horniman to read his tarot cards concerning “a certain matter whichhe could not describe in any way.” Mollified by the divination, he privatelyconfided to Yeats,I came back from Ireland on Wednesday. I have not slept since then, with theexception of a few hours today. I have been in great trouble. My conscience hasbeen going here and there like a weather cock. I could not find out what I hadto do—I wanted to do right. She has held my conscience still. I know now whereit is pointing. But there may be no miracle play now. This may be socialextinction for me.53 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts053][images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_023_r1.jpg]Ludovic Cameron, a.k.a. Louis Charles Richard Duncombe-Jewell (1866–1947).(photo credit 5.2) [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c05-fig002a]A few months later, on April 28, 1903, his son Anthony Michael Duncombe-Jewellwas born at 11 St. James Terrace, Plymouth;54[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts054] however, this child was not withhim at Boleskine, nor is he mentioned in Duncombe-Jewell’s biographies.55[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts055] A year and a day later, on April29, 1904, his wife Mary, aged thirty-four, died of shock from on operation fordouble salpingitis (inflammation of both fallopian tubes); her sister Frances H.Slaughter was present at the time of death.56[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts056] It is unclear whetherDuncombe-Jewell was present at either of these events; he is not the informantfor the certified record of either the birth or the death. At this time, hechanged his name by deed poll to Ludovic Cameron; Lowenna suggests this may havebeen a tactic to dodge creditors.57[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts057] Whether the subject of hisdivination was financial, paternal, matrimonial, or other, his old friend’shouse Boleskine provided the perfect opportunity for Ludovic Cameron to laylow.58 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts058]In June, Crowley moved his bed into the temple, and five days later beganpracticing meditation for the Abramelin working. His introspection lasted nearlya month until, during a July 13 trip to Edinburgh to restock on wine, he hired a“red-haired Arabella” as his mistress and housekeeper. Endowed with wine andwoman, Crowley moved on to song, writing “The God Eater.”Shortly after returning, he received a letter from Gerald Kelly. His mother wasundergoing a medical cure in nearby Strathpeffer, and Gerald invited Crowley tojoin him there. Bored with the placidness of his Scottish estate, and withArabella still packing in Edinburgh, he made the trip twenty miles north ofFoyers and met the Kelly entourage: Gerald’s mother was a typical Victorian ladywho “worthily preserved the conditions of Tennysonian dignity.”59[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts059] His sister Rose Edith Skerrett(1874–1932), who accompanied Mrs. Kelly on the trip, was beautiful butuneducated, charming yet nervous. Rose’s fiancé, a solicitor named Hill, wasalso present.On August 11, while Gerald and Hill played golf, Crowley found himself and Rosewalking along, watching and talking. “Your brother is a daring young man,” hetold Rose. “Playing golf is not the sort of thing one brags of to friends inLondon.”Rose laughed politely and smiled gracefully. Crowley was unsure what else to sayto her: Her education was social and domestic in focus, leaving her ignorant ofart and literature. Fearing Gerald’s friend would continue looking at herdumbly, she said the first thing that came to mind: “ ‘Bright Star, would I weresteadfast as thou art.’ ”60 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts060]He smiled. “You like Keats?”“Yes,” she answered, eyes glittering, then averted her gaze. “Well, truth totell, it’s the only line I know. I keep a book of poems in my dressing case so Ican impress Gerald’s college chums by asking them to fetch it for me. I’ve nevereven read the book.”“I must applaud your brilliant device. It certainly served to find a suitor inMr. Hill.”“Yes,” she muttered with downcast eyes which suddenly rose to meet his gaze.“Can I confide in you?”“ ‘In quietness and confidence shall be your strength.’ ”61[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts061]She regarded him blankly. “Excuse me?”“Mademoiselle,” he clarified, “nothing would please me more.”Rose nodded in understanding, and explained her predicament. At agetwenty-one—on August 31, 1897—she had married a man more than twenty years hersenior, Major Frederick Thomas Skerrett (c. 1859–1899) of the Royal Army MedicalService.62 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts062] He had received hismedical license in 1879 through the King and Queens College of Physicians inIreland, and became a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland in1880.63 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts063] Rose lived with him inSouth Africa until he died two years later, then returned home and enjoyednumerous lovers, two of whom even proposed. Not having the heart to turn eitherof them down, Rose accepted both offers. Suitor number 1, Hill, returned toSouth Africa to earn some money for their future, while Suitor number 2, Howell,a Cambridge chum of Gerald’s, returned to America to ask permission of hisfather. Unfortunately, she did not love either man. No, she was in love with amarried man named Frank Summers, who wanted to put Rose up in her own flat. Asif this scandal wasn’t enough, Rose convinced her parents to give her £40 for anabortion when in fact she merely wanted dinner and some new clothes. This pushedthem to the limit, and when Hill and Howell both cabled that they were coming tomarry her, her parents insisted she wed one of them. Her predicament was thather parents were pressuring her into a loveless marriage, while her true love,Summers, was already taken.The tale brought out Crowley’s “Shelleyan indignation,” and he felt it incumbentupon himself to intervene. They sat down under a tree to ponder thecircumstances. After contemplation, Crowley broke the silence by suggesting thatshe marry him. Afterward, he would return to his poetry, mountains and magick,and she would be free to do as she pleased.Rose pondered the idea and did the thing that got her into trouble in the firstplace: she said yes. Counting her first husband, it was the fourth time Rose hadaccepted a proposal of marriage. For Crowley, it was the third time he hadbecome engaged. Rose, despite AC’s reservations, told her brother the news oncehe rejoined them from his game. Gerald laughed heartily, dismissed theannouncement as a prank, and finished the course two under par. The future groomlooked at his bride-to-be and shrugged. “And I was afraid the news would put himoff his game.”Crowley went into town that day to arrange his hasty marriage to Rose Kelly.Although the parish sexton insisted that licensing took three weeks—one ifrushed—he learned the sheriff could marry them on the spot.The dawn was still dim when Crowley greeted Rose the next morning with a quotefrom Macbeth: “Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst!”64[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts064] They sneaked off furtively so asnot to wake Gerald, and caught the next train to Dingwall. Since she knew noliterature, and Crowley couldn’t guess what might interest her, they passed theride in silence. “I don’t have to live with her,” he assured himself. “All Ihave to do is emancipate her. There’s no reason to talk to her.”Dingwall was cold, damp, and asleep. So was the sheriff, whose maid said hewould be unavailable until 8 o’clock … or 9, or 10. This was unacceptable, sothey found a lawyer who said he could see them at eight. The couple nervouslypassed the time at breakfast, then meeting the lawyer, simply expressed theirintention to marry and declared themselves husband and wife. On August 12, 1903,Alexander Ross declared Aleister Crowley MacGregor, landed proprietor andbachelor, and Rose Skerrett, widow, married. Aside from registering the marriagewith the sheriff, that was all the law required.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_024_r1.jpg]Rose Edith Kelly (1874–1932). (photo credit 5.3)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c05-fig003a]Crowley, seeking to interject drama into the otherwise prosaic proceedings,pulled out his dirk and kissed it with a pledge of faith. The kiss was more thanthe bride herself received, for Gerald burst into the room at that moment, hellbent on stopping the marriage. When he learned he was too late, he threw a punchat Crowley. It missed completely, leaving Crowley smirking at his feeblegesture. When tempers cooled, they agreed it would be best if Crowley returnedto Boleskine while Gerald took his sister home. Aleister was happy to comply: itwas what he intended all along.A furor erupted over the elopement. Rejected Mr. Hill insisted the marriage beannulled. Duncombe-Jewell assured the Kellys that their daughter’s marriage wasin fact legal. Meanwhile, Rose, “the game little bitch she was,”65[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts065] stood by her decision. After theinitial shock wore off, Crowley fetched Rose and registered their marriage withDingwall’s sheriff. Then, to silence local scandal, they took a train to thewest coast of Scotland under the pretense of a honeymoon.Giddy at having pulled this off, Crowley considered his work done, but feltuncomfortable—even embarrassed—continuing the charade. He sat opposite Rose inthe empty car and, at an uncharacteristic loss of words, made small talk andjokes until their arrival early that evening. Sheepish about registering as amarried man, he made up some excuse and sent Rose to the desk clerk. He was bothdisappointed and relieved that she booked a room with two beds.They drank a lot of champagne over dinner that night. When Rose finished andretired to bed, Crowley went to the smoking room and drank a lot more. He wasnervous about returning to the room with his “wife.” Finding a sympatheticstranger, Crowley babbled about his troubles until he scared the man off. Then,remembering he was, after all, a romantic young poet on his honeymoon, hegrabbed a scrap of paper and dashed off a rondel to his bride:Rose on the breast of the world of spring,I press my breast against thy bloom;My subtle life drawn out to thee: to theeits moods and meanings cling.66 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts066]Having discovered his poetic voice, Crowley found empathy with Rose. He finishedthe composition, went upstairs and pondered the possibility that Rose was inlove with him. He also wondered if he was in love with her.By the time the couple returned to Boleskine, Crowley’s detached willingness to“propitiate physiology” on their honeymoon transformed into loving sentiments of“uninterrupted beatitude.” They were in love with each other.Gerald’s initial fury about the wedding was slow to fade. Laird Boleskine was anentertaining and desirable friend while he was jaunting around the world writingsensual poetry and sending chummy letters detailing his latest conquests. But asa brother-in-law, he was a womanizing degenerate. These harsh sentimentsgradually mellowed, and the friends again exchanged amusing letters. By the endof the summer, the Crowleys traveled to Paris to visit brother Gerald.Crowley took Rose walking on the streets of Paris, showing her his old hauntsand trying to impress her with stories of the local celebrities he hadbefriended during his last stay. While walking over the Pont Alexandre III, theyencountered an even older luminary: Moïna Mathers. He chatted animatedly withSoror VNR, whom Rose assumed was a model. Only when later years left him withbitter and disillusioned memories of Mathers would he viciously claim heencountered her at a time when Mathers was pimping her on the streets of Paris.For now, they were simply fond friends.In fall of 1903 he published Ahab as a companion volume to Jezebel. This editionconsisted of twelve copies on vellum and 150 on handmade paper. Because it wasset in Caxton type, the book was difficult to read and garnered little commentat all from the press. In November, Crowley dashed off a hasty note to Blackett,his agent at Kegan Paul: “Called suddenly away to distant lands,”67[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts067] he wrote. He was going on hishoneymoon.Rose of the World deserved a better honeymoon than the obscure inn of some smallScottish town. Man of the world that he was, Crowley planned a cosmopolitangetaway, taking them to Bertolini’s at Naples, on to Cairo for a short visit, toCeylon to meet Allan Bennett, then to China.In Cairo, as elsewhere, Crowley went to great trouble to impress his beloved,whom he now embraced with characteristic passion. A night in the King’s Chamberof the Great Pyramid of Giza struck him as romantic, so he arranged it. Theymarched to the pyramid and had dinner; then Crowley dismissed the servants andtook the dinner candles with them down into the chamber. Surrounded by mysteriesas old as civilization itself, Crowley demonstrated for Rose his magical skills:He took out the Goetia and, crouched over the dim candlelight, straining to makeout the words, he recited:Thee, I invoke, the bornless one.Thee, that didst create the Earth and the Heavens:Thee, that didst create the Night and the day.Thee, that didst create the darkness and the Light.As he became enraptured in the reading, he stood upright and recited withfeverish drama. Pausing only to catch his breath, he noticed something odd: Heno longer crouched over the candle, straining to read. The chamber glowed withastral light, and he could now read without difficulty.While the results encouraged him, he reminded himself he was now a married man.Extinguishing the candle, he blackened the room again and sought his bride inthe darkness.Crowley next wrote for this wife the poem “Rosa Mundi,” which he would publishin 1905. To accompany it, Kelly offered Crowley an illustration dubbed “TheBlood Lotus” after the poem of the same title in White Stains (later reprintedin Oracles). Fearing his reputation might suffer by association with Crowley,Kelly later reconsidered and asked him not to use it.68[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts068]In December, as the newlyweds headed toward Ceylon, Rose announced she thoughtshe was pregnant. Overjoyed, Crowley canceled their visit and prepared to returnto Europe, where she would receive proper care. However, since they had comethis far, Crowley suggested, “Let’s go and kill something for a month or two,and if you’re right, we’ll get back to nurses and doctors.” So they headed southof Ceylon to Galle so he could show Rose what a great big game hunter herhusband was. Pitching camp in a lakeside bungalow, Crowley kept busy stalkingleopards, cheetahs, elephants, buffalo, and wild boars. Then, studying the lowtrees that grew along the shore, their branches jutting over the water, Crowleynoticed new game. The bats that covered these branches while sleeping had redfur and white breasts. They looked like small foxes, and would make a fine toquefor Rose and waistcoat for himself.They took a boat onto the lake and floated silently under the sleeping bats.Crowley readied his gun, took aim, and fired. The gunshot echoed through theforests as the sky turned black with startled bats. He shot hastily at theescaping mammals until a scream pierced his ears. Rose! he thought, and spunaround to find a wounded bat caught in her hair, thrashing about as wildly asshe.Even after AC managed to extract the bat from her hair and determined his wifewas unharmed, Rose had difficulty calming down. He took her back to dry land,drew the mosquito netting around their bed, and climbed in beside her, soothingher and convincing her to rest until he too drifted off. In sleep, he heard thesound of a squealing bat. It persisted until, half conscious, he realized it wasno dream. “Rose?” he whispered, prepared to ask, “Do you hear that?” He calledher once, twice; but no reply came. He lit a candle and in its flickering lightfound Rose clinging naked to the mosquito netting frame, squealing wildly like abat. She failed to respond to his voice, and resisted his efforts to help herdown. When at last he got her back onto the bed, she scratched, spat, and bit athim like the creature that had taken a bullet.In the morning, Rose was fine again. Crowley was unsure whether to attribute thespectacle to pregnancy or, as he later described it, “the finest case ofobsession that I ever had the good fortune to observe.”69[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts069]Leaving the wilderness, they stopped in Kandy, where Crowley wrote Why JesusWept. On January 28, 1904, they left for Suez, reaching Port Said by February 8.They continued back toward Cairo the next day, where they opted to rest. Crowleyregistered them into a hotel as “Prince Chioa Khan, and his Princess, Ouarda.”The names were Arabic for Master Beast and Rose.Because Scotland got so cold and damp in the winter, they decided to remain inCairo until spring. So, on March 14, Prince Chioa Khan and Ouarda took a flat ina corner house near Cairo’s museum in the fashionable European quarter. Two dayslater, in another demonstration of magical prowess, Crowley attempted to showRose the sylphs, elemental spirits of the air. Entering the north room of theflat, which he had converted into his temple, he began to conjure the mysticalcreatures for his wife.Crowley didn’t notice Rose’s vacant stare until she began to mutter, “They arewaiting for you.” At first, he paid no attention. When it happened again thenext day during a repeat of his conjuration, he grew annoyed. “They are waitingfor you,” she hazily insisted. “It is all about the child; all Osiris.” Crowleyattributed it to morning sickness or alcohol, and proceeded to invoke. Finally,on the third day in a row when Crowley performed the conjuration, Rose’s eyesglazed over, and she muttered, “He who waits is Horus,” Crowley raised aneyebrow. Rose didn’t read mythology, let alone study it. How did she come upwith that name? Was she actually in contact with the god? Her comment piqued hisinterest, and he seized the opportunity to cross-examine her.“How do you know Horus is telling you all this?” he asked her. “Can you identifyhim?” She said she could, and he proceeded to test her about the god: hisappearance and corresponding color, weapon, planet, and numbers; his moralqualities; his enemy. To Crowley’s astonishment, she answered every questioncorrectly. The odds of her doing this by chance was infinitesimal.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_025_r1.jpg]The twenty-sixth dynasty funerary stele of Theban priest Ankh-f-n-Khonsu,referred to in The Book of the Law as the Stele of Revealing. (photo credit 5.4)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c05-fig004a]As a final test, Crowley took Rose to the museum and asked her to point to theimage of Horus. As she walked among the many steles and statues, passing variousimages of Horus along the way, Crowley smiled knowingly. Rose headed upstairsand pointed to a glass case across the room. “There he is.”Crowley squinted at the case, unable to make it out from this distance, andwalked toward it. He found a wooden funerary stele from Egypt’s twenty-sixthdynasty (c. 725 BC) that the Theban priest Ankhefenkhons I (or Ankh-f-n-Khonsu,in Crowley’s era), had designed for himself. It depicted Ra-Hoor-Khuit orRa-Herakhty, the composite deity of the sun god, Ra, with his son, Horus.Glancing at the exhibit, Crowley’s heart leapt as he noticed it bore catalognumber 666.Having passed her test, Rose advised Crowley how to properly invoke Horus. Heprotested about form and style, but she insisted he perform the ritual as given.If he followed instructions, she promised, he would have results on Saturday orSunday. Since the next day was Saturday, he followed the absurd directions andmet with no success.On Sunday, March 20, at 10 p.m., he again conducted the ceremony. This time, helearned this was the time of the Equinox of the Gods. While the GD celebratedthe astronomical equinox that marked the first day of spring or autumn, in thiscase it referred to the beginning of the first day of a new age. According tothis view, religious thought followed regular patterns: the world’s oldestreligions worshiped nature and the earth mother and are identified (arbitrarily)with the Egyptian mother-goddess Isis. In more recent history, religions werepatriarchal and ultimately cast with suffering or dying figureheads such asJesus, Adonis, and Attis; thus this phase of history was identified with theEgyptian slain and resurrected patriarch Osiris. The viewpoint that would becomedominant in the next phase of humankind was typified by Horus, the son of Isisand Osiris. Adherence to this view of cosmic cycles betrays Crowley’s Brethrenupbringing, for dispensationalism, the belief that history proceeds in a seriesof stages or dispensations, is a common fundamentalist doctrine.70[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts070]Crowley also learned that the speaker of these messages was not Horus himselfbut a messenger named Aiwass or Aiwaz. Crowley regarded the name with suspicion,thinking Rose manufactured it from the Arabic word “aiwa” (yes) which she hadheard in Cairo. Years would pass before Crowley accepted Aiwass as the actualname of his holy guardian angel. Even in his last years, however, Crowleyremained uncertain about the nature of Aiwass:The only point undetermined is whether He is a discarnate Being, or … a humanbeing, presumably Assyrian, of that name. And that I simply do not know, andcannot reasonably surmise, because I do not know the limits of the powers ofsuch an One.71 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts071]For the next two weeks, Crowley busied himself with stele 666. He dined with themuseum’s curator and expressed an interest in the artifact. Named by Crowley asBrugsch Bey, this curator was actually German Egyptologist Émile Brugsch(1842–1930); “Bey” along with “Pasha” were titles awarded him by the Egyptiangovernment for his service to the Cairo and Boulak Museums.72[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts072]Brugsch arranged for his French assistant to translate and reproduce the stele.The inscriptions, it turned out, were adaptations from the Egyptian Book of theDead. Once Crowley received the French translation, he set it to verse.On April 7, Rose went into a trance and gave new instructions to her husband:for the next three days, he was to enter the temple in their flat precisely atnoon and write down what he heard. He would stop again precisely at 1 o’clock.By this time, he believed Rose’s instructions and followed them.The next day, Crowley stepped into his temple at noon and sat at his desk, penand paper ready. He waited for something to happen. Anticipation clenched him.What if nothing happened? he wondered. Then he reconsidered: What if somethingdid?Then it did: from behind his left shoulder, a voice spoke to him: “Had! Themanifestation of Nuit. The unveiling of the company of heaven.” Crowleydescribed the experience in these words:The Voice of Aiwass came apparently from over my left shoulder, from thefurthest corner of the room. It seemed to echo itself in my physical heart in avery strange manner, hard to describe.… The voice was of deep timbre, musicaland expressive, its tones solemn, voluptuous, tender, fierce or aught else assuited the moods of the message. Not bass—perhaps a rich tenor or baritone.The English was free of either native or foreign accent, perfectly pure of localor caste mannerisms, thus startling and even uncanny at first hearing.I had a strong impression that the speaker was actually in the corner where heseemed to be, in a body of “fine matter,” transparent as a veil of gauze, or acloud of incense-smoke. He seemed to be a tall, dark man in his thirties,well-knit, active and strong, with the face of a savage king, and eyes veiledlest their gaze should destroy what they saw. The dress was not Arab; itsuggested Assyria or Persia, but very vaguely.73[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts073]He scribbled down the words frantically as Aiwass proceeded. “Every man andevery woman is a star. Every number is infinite; there is no difference. Helpme, o warrior lord of Thebes, in my unveiling before the Children of men!”74[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts074]Aiwass described the Egyptian sky goddess Nuit, who represented the universe,infinite and complete. Although all things were part of her, she willinglyseparated into distinct elements, identities, and objects so that all theuniverse could experience the joy of union. Her message was clear enough: “For Iam divided for love’s sake, for the chance of union75[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts075]. Take your fill and will of loveas ye will, when, where, and with whom ye will! But always unto me76[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts076]. Love is the law, love underwill.”77 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts077] She called not forgratuitous sex, but for love as a transcendent experience, as the divine unionof male and female principles. In exchange for this adoration, “I giveunimaginable joys on earth.”78 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts078]The point of this disquisition became clear with the words, “This that thouwritest is the threefold book of Law.”79[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts079] Its verses contained the basictenets of Thelemic philosophy: “The word of the law is[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L03_r1.jpg].80[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts080] … Do what thou wilt shall be thewhole of the Law … thou hast no right but to do thy will. Do that and no othershall say nay. For pure will, unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust ofresult, is every way perfect.”81 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts081]The crux of this philosophy was the notion of True Will, expressed by the Greekword for “will,” [images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L03_r1.jpg] or thelema. As partof the cosmic scheme, every being was imbued with a purpose to which it mustdevote itself. One’s Will should be pursued to the exclusion of all else,barring activities—such as resting, eating, and working—that make the pursuitpossible. In this view, if everyone were to do one’s Will, there would be noconflict in the world. Magic was the means of discovering one’s Will.The phrase “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law”82[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts082] was not entirely original withthis book. St. Augustine himself had declared, “Love and do what you will.”83[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts083] An angel told John Dee, “Do thatwhich most pleaseth you … wherefore do even as you list.” Satirist FrancoisRabelais (c. 1494–1553) wrote “Faictz ce que vouldras,”84[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts084] and described an Abbaye deThélème. And Sir Walter Besant (1836–1901) and James Rice’s (1843–1882) novelThe Monks of Thelema describes a church similar to Rabelais’s Abbey.85[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts085] However, The Book of the Law wasoriginal in its interpretation of those eleven words.86[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts086]After an hour elapsed, the voice vanished with the statement, “The Manifestationof Nuit is at an end.”87 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts087]Over the next two days, Crowley recorded two more chapters of what would becomeThe Book of the Law, the cornerstone of his magical philosophy of Thelema. Hislife would never again be the same.Chapter two is a small drama, a clash between the author and the scribe. WhereasNuit represented infinity, the “speaker” of chapter two, Hadit, represented thefinite point, or Nuit made manifest. When he announced, “Remember all ye thatexistence is pure joy,”88 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts088]Crowley objected. The First Noble Truth of Buddhism taught that existence wassorrow. Aiwass responded, “O prophet! thou hast ill will to learn this writing.I see thee hate the hand & the pen, but I am stronger.”89[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts089] As the dictation continued,Crowley surrendered to the rapture of the words. After dictating magical ciphersand formulae, Aiwass observed, “Thou art exhaust in the voluptuous fullness ofthe inspiration.”90 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts090] Indeed, theexperience swept him away in ecstasy and exhausted him.Notions of existence being enjoyable appeared long before The Book of the Law.Tantra, for instance, imbued itself with similar life-positive viewpoints.However, such philosophies were generally driven underground by those whopreferred to think of mankind dangling over the abyss of hell like a loathsomespider. Thus civilization had been shaped by asceticism, austerity, abstinence,sorrow, suffering, and sin. The Book of the Law marked a break with thatperspective, proclaiming “The word of Sin is Restriction.”91[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts091] Original or not, such was themessage Crowley received on that second day.The final chapter was a disturbing and apocalyptic speech by the war godRa-Hoor-Khuit. Amidst practical instructions and identification of Crowley asthe Great Beast also fall its most repugnant statements: “With my Hawk’s head Ipeck at the eyes of Jesus as he hangs upon the cross. I flap my wings in theface of Mohammed & blind him. With my claws I tear out the flesh of the Indianand the Buddhist, Mongol and Din. Bahlasti! Ompehda! I spit on your crapulouscreeds.”92 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts092] The scribe wasshocked by these declarations, and this initial reaction prevented him for sometime from accepting the book. Only later would he understand these passages tosymbolize the abrogation of old creeds.Three days, three hours, and The Book of the Law was recorded. The process wasnot without problems: When, writing page 6 of the manuscript, he heard the words“the unfragmentary non-atomic fact of my universality,” he failed to understand:“Write this in whiter words, but go on,” Aiwass instructed. So, after the fact,Crowley changed the words to “The omnipresence of my body.” Similarly, whenwriting verse sixty of chapter one, Crowley missed a sentence. Rose herselflater added the words, “The Five Pointed Star with a Circle in the Middle, & thecircle is Red.” Rose also corrected chapter three, verse seventy-two, whereCrowley misheard the phrase, “Force of Coph Nia.”Throughout the manuscript, Aiwass left space for Crowley to add his poetictranslations of the stele. This he did, also adding missing punctuation andverse numbers. With that, The Book of the Law was completed.Crowley always maintained that this book originated from outside his ownintelligence. As he wrote to a student in 1936,The Book of the Law is not in any way my work.… It is not inspired. It wasdictated, and the only duty of a scribe is to take down accurately what is said.In this particular case, the scribe disagreed heartily with a very great deal ofthe material. This frequently happens in business offices. But I should notrecommend you listen to the financial opinion of a girl who is transcribing theletters of J.P. Morgan at eighteen dollars a week.93[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts093]Nevertheless, one may reasonably ask whether The Book of the Law represented astartling revelation, or whether Crowley had prefigured some of its contents inhis own work. Certainly, the notion of Will as has been described previously hadcrept into Crowley’s thinking, even appearing in his letters to Gerald Kelly. Hehad already identified himself with the Great Beast in The Sword of Song.Adumbrations of “Do what thou wilt” occur in numerous earlier sources. And thecorrupted magical formula “abracadabra,” as restored in The Book of the Law,turns up three years earlier in Crowley’s 1901 diary, where he “DesignedAbrahadabra for a pantacle.”94 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts094]Nevertheless, subsequent events would convince Crowley that The Book of the Lawwas dictated by a being possessed of knowledge far greater than his own. “It isthe only known document which carries in itself proof that its author belongs toa totally different Order of Being; he sees things from a point beyond ourconception.”95 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts095]Crowley was dumbfounded about what to do with The Book of the Law. Receiving it,he was certain, meant he was a great magician, but he had no desire to progress.Although Aiwass gave specific instructions for him to follow—for example, he wasto take the stele from the museum, obtain an island and fortify it with weapons,and translate the book into all languages—none of these did he find realistic.Instead of publishing an elaborate edition of the book with a comment, as Aiwasstold him, he merely sent typescripts of the work with a “careless manifesto,”96[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts096] announcing the dawn of a newera. Then he put aside the book with relief.The Crowleys set sail for Europe in April. Onboard, Aleister found TheosophistAnnie Besant (1897–1933), future head of the TS; although they discussed manymystical subjects, he never mentioned his remarkable experience in Cairo. ByApril 26, he and Rose were back in Paris, lunching with Arnold Bennett. Crowley,dressed in a jeweled waistcoat and the largest ring Bennett had ever seen,proceeded to explain how he had registered as Prince Chioa Khan in Egypt. Whenthe topic turned to the supernatural, Bennett recounted the tale of Beardsleybeing seen in London after his death. Bennett’s accent was strong, and Crowley,although he understood the story, did so with difficulty.“That’s nothing,” Crowley quipped when Bennett finished. “I know a man who sawOscar Wilde in the Pyrenees and spoke to him while the man was supposedlyimprisoned in England.”“Really?” Bennett bit. “Who’s that?”After a pause, he answered in a low voice, “Me.”97[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts097]In all, Bennett enjoyed discussing the supernatural and the nature ofintelligence with Crowley. AC had just written the essay “Time,” and Bennettoffered to introduce him to his friend, science fiction author H. G. Wells(1866–1946), that evening at the Metropole for comments on his essay. Bennett,in his difficult voice, offered only one bit of advice about Wells: “He speaksEnglish with an accent.”98 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts098]Despite the letter of introduction, Crowley never appeared at the Metropole tomeet H. G. Wells. The next day he returned to London and ultimately Boleskine.The estate on Loch Ness became a watering hole for Crowley’s friends: DoctorPercival Bott came in to watch over the course of Rose’s pregnancy. Geraldarrived for a stay, as did their mutual friend, the London surgeon Ivor Back.Finally, Crowley’s Aunt Annie came to help keep house.The Crowleys practiced at magic on their return home, Rose retaining her powersof seership. Crowley followed a recipe from The Book of the Law for incense andcakes made of honey, wine, olive oil, and menstrual blood. If set out, the bookclaimed, the cakes would attract beetles. Were he to name an enemy and kill abeetle, that enemy would die; similarly, were he to eat a beetle, he wouldbecome strong and lusty. Crowley tested the claim by leaving cakes out, and aspromised beetles appeared. Crowley neither named enemies nor ate the insects,but he sent samples to London’s Natural History Museum, whose entomologists, heclaims, had never seen this particular type before.When Mathers failed to reply to receipt of The Book of the Law and a letterdeclaring that the Secret Chiefs had appointed Perdurabo as visible head of theorder, Crowley assumed trouble was brewing. When his hunting dogs mysteriouslydied and a servant assaulted Rose, he concluded it was magical attack by ajealous Mathers. So, using a talisman from Abramelin, Crowley evoked Beelzebubagainst him while Rose, “arse high in the air,” described the demon’s forty-nineservitors.99 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts099] When word ofCrowley’s deprecations reached him, Mathers cried slander and contacted hissolicitor. He demanded a formal apology, and expelled Crowley from the order."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXTHE FIVE PEAKSKegan Paul disappointed Crowley with slow sales and price reductions on hisoverstocked titles. Since 1902, only ten copies of Tannhäuser had sold, five ofCarmen Sæculare, seven of Soul of Osiris, and two of Jephthah. Appeal to theAmerican Republic, The Mother’s Tragedy, Tale of Archais, and Songs of theSpirit had not sold at all. In May 1904, Crowley closed his account with thepublisher1 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts001] and called on CharlesWatts of London to do his printing. To combat what he considered mismanagementof his stock of books, Crowley decided to distribute his works himself. He namedhis publishing house the Society for the Propagation of Religious Truth (SPRT),a parody of the Church of England’s venerable Society for Promoting ChristianKnowledge. Much speculation has surrounded Crowley’s decision to move his bookpublishing activities from London to Foyers, with some erroneously suggesting hewas avoiding criminal charges for strangling a woman. As he rebutted,My dealings with Kegan Paul had nothing at all to do with the strangling of anywoman. The unsold copies of my books were taken over by the Society for thePropagation of Religious Truth, because Kegan Paul were making no efforts tosell them.… So please loosen the rope round the poor lady’s neck.2[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts002]A glut of new releases appeared in privately published editions as he preparedthe transition to SPRT.Alice: An Adultery, commemorating his Pacific affair in one hundred copies onChina paper, met with cold press reactions. The Star and the Garter appeared ina companion edition of fifty on handmade paper and two on Roman vellum; althoughCrowley thought the book contained “some of my best lyrics,”3[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts003] reviewers deemed itunintelligible. The God Eater followed the camel hair wraps format of theseprevious titles; it was a short play (thirty-two pages) that Crowley would latercall “singularly unsatisfactory.”4[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts004]Business stopped at Boleskine on July 28 when Dr. Percival Bott5[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts005] (1877–1953) delivered theCrowleys’ healthy daughter, whom the proud father named Nuit Ma Ahathoor HecateSappho Jezebel Lilith. For days afterward, Crowley celebrated with Bott, Back,Kelly, Rose, Duncombe-Jewell, and Aunt Annie. Rose wanted something to readwhile recuperating, but found her husband’s collection of literature,philosophy, and mysticism far too cerebral. She wanted a simple romance. Havingnone at his disposal, Crowley decided to write his own brand of romance novelfor the entertainment of his convalescing wife and their house guests. Thus,house party activities daily involved a reading of the chapter Crowley hadwritten that day for “The Nameless Novel.”“Good, by Jesus!” cried the Countess, as, with her fat arse poised warily overthe ascetic face of the Archbishop, she lolloped a great gob of greasy spendfrom the throat of her bulging cunt into the gaping mouth of the half-chokedecclesiastic.6 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts006]So begins the chronicle of a sexually demented archbishop, a novel purposelyvulgar and shocking to parody what Crowley considered the only type of book Rosewould enjoy. Throughout the writing of this piece, Crowley kept Farmer andHenley’s Slang and its Analogues nearby. The results so entertained his gueststhat Kelly and Back helped assemble Crowley’s early attempts at vulgar verse andpuerile parody into a package titled Snowdrops from a Curate’s Garden. Itincluded such gems as “To pe or not to pe,” “All the world’s a brothel,” “Buggerme gently, Bertie!” and “Girls together.” Of course, there wasn’t an Englishpress that would touch it.After the household cleared, the Crowleys adjusted to their roles as parents. ACput aside magic to be a husband and father. In a letter to her brother, Rosecaptured the mood of these times:All goes well here. The kid—Nuit Ma Ahathoor Hecate Sappho Jezebel Lilith—to becalled by the last name—flourishes. She’s a good little maid tho’ she doessquawk occasionally which drives Aleister out rabbit shooting. We’ve such astock to consume in the house!7 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts007]Despite the time that fatherhood took from his magic, Crowley the poet continuedto thrive: The Sword of Song, called by Christians The Book of the Beast,dedicated to Allan Bennett, appeared to the astonishment of the press.Stephensen (1930) correctly called it a complex work, and it is the mostimportant of his early books. The edition of one hundred copies, at tenshillings, was one of his most expensive books to date, but, at 194 pages, itwas also among his longest. Its navy blue cover, printed in gold, boremysterious emblems: a three-by-three set of squares depicting the number 666thrice, and the author’s name rendered in Hebrew such that its numerical valueadded up to this same number. Within is the autobiographical passage:Yet by-and-by I hope to weaveA song of Anti-Christmas EveAnd First- and Second-Beast-er Day.There’s one who loves me dearly (vrai!)Who yet believes me sprung from Tophet,Either the Beast or the False Prophet;And by all sorts of monkey tricksAdds up my name to Six Six Six …Ho! I adopt the number. LookAt the quaint wrapper of this book!I will deserve it if I can:It is the number of a Man.8 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts008]In this poem, the one who loves him dearly is his mother; Tophet is the abyss ofhell, and the last line refers to Revelation 13:18: “Let him that hathunderstanding count the number of the beast; for it is the number of a man; andhis number is 666.” This poem is significant because it corrects the commonassertion that Crowley identified himself with the Great Beast when he assumedthe mantle of prophet of the New Aeon of Horus: this poem was written before TheBook of the Law. Similarly, Crowley registered himself in Egypt as “Chioa Khan,”Master Beast, before writing his Holy Book. Thus, his identification with theGreat Beast 666 predated The Book of the Law, and most certainly originated withCrowley’s mother, who so often referred to him as such. In this and variousother ways, The Sword of Song documents Crowley’s intellectual and philosophicaldevelopments that adumbrate The Book of the Law.Aside from poetry, The Sword of Song also contained the essays “Berashith,”“Science and Buddhism,” and “Ambrosii Magi Hortus Rosarum,” a work that wouldcome back to haunt him in later years. The entire package is an odd andentertaining mix of mystic poetry and essays on Buddhist thought. Its notes andcontents are snide, cynical, and often amusing. While the Literary Guide praisedthe book as “a masterpiece of learning and satire” and its author as “one of themost brilliant of contemporary writers,”9[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts009] reviewers generally reacted withperplexity. Following up on his review of Soul of Osiris, G. K. Chestertontitled his reactions to AC’s latest work “Mr. Crowley and the Creeds,” callinghim a good poet but expressing reservations about his Buddhist faith and obvioushatred of Christianity.10 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts010]Crowley reacted defensively, and issued a pamphlet titled “A Child of Ephraim.”It merely signaled the beginning of Crowley’s crusade against Chesterton.In October, Crowley traveled to the resort town of Saint Moritz, Switzerland,for a holiday of skating and skiing. En route, the bard stopped in Paris aroundthe 28th to arrange with Philippe Renouard the publication of Snowdrops from aCurate’s Garden for his friends. The edition of one hundred copies was bound ingreen wrappers, bearing the false imprint place of “Cosmopoli” (taken from thehomosexual novel Teleny, attributed to Oscar Wilde and printed by Smithers).Equally false was the imprint date of 1881 (the publication year of thehomosexual novel Sins of the Cities of the Plain).11[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts011] Rose, wishing a vacation frommothering, left Lilith with her parents and their nurse, and joined Aleister inNovember. They stayed at the fashionable Kulm Hotel. The other guests werestunned and amused by AC’s ermine-lapelled velvet coat, silk knee-breeches, andenormous meerschaum pipe. He likewise sneered at the bourgeois patrons. Theysoon learned that he was not only an accomplished mountaineer, scholar, andpoet, but the finest skater there.Another guest at the hotel was author Clifford Bax (1886-1962), then justeighteen years old. He had come with his two cousins to regain his health, andspent his spare time reading A History of the Rosicrucians.12[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts012] The book prompted a discussionwhen he and Crowley met. “What do you know of the Great Science?” AC askedeagerly. “Or of Cornelius Agrippa? Perhaps you would find this helpful.” Hehanded the young man a vellum book. Looking it over, he discovered it was byCrowley. “It is a treatise on ceremonial magic.”“Thank you,” Bax replied, looking around to see if anyone was watching.Crowley dismissed his concern. “What do you think the morons in this hotel wouldmake of your interest in the Rosicrucians?”Before he knew what was going on, Bax found Crowley offering to instruct him inmagic. “Most good of you,” Bax replied sheepishly, “but … maybe I’m not ready. Ithink I should read some more.”“Nonsense! Reading is for children; men must do. Experiment! Seize the gift thegods offer. If you reject me, you will be indistinguishable from the idiotsaround us. If you accept my offer, you can help me found a new world religion.”Suddenly, he shifted gears and asked, “What is the date?”“January 25.” Bloody Sunday, the massacre at St. Petersburg, had just occurredthree days before.“And the year, according to the Christian calendar?”“1905.”Crowley nodded. “Exactly. And in a hundred years, the world will be sitting inthe dawn of a New Aeon.”13 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts013]When the frost yielded, the Crowleys returned to the British Isles. AC journeyedto London to tend to publishing business. Returning to Strathpeffer to fetch hiswife, who was staying with her parents, he found Rose ill. She was also evasiveabout discussing her condition. Crowley pressed, and Rose finally explained:since Lilith was born, her periods had been irregular and she feared she wasagain pregnant. Her parents’ nurse, to whom she confided, gave her ergot toinduce an abortion. When the prescription failed, a double dose followed. Thenshe became ill.Crowley’s head swam with powerful emotions. He was furious that Rose shouldattempt to snuff a life and jeopardize her health through abortion. He was alsosuspicious of just what substance the nurse had been giving his wife to make herso ill. Bundling Rose and Lilith, he took his family to the Imperial Hotel andwired Bott and Back, the only physicians he trusted, to meet him at London’sSavoy Hotel. Then he wired Gerald to get Roses’s medicine under the pretense ofsending it to her in London, and have a chemist analyze it. Then the Crowleysbegan a return trip to London. Bott and Back heard the case and, in the end,agreed on the diagnosis: Rose was not pregnant, but she was suffering from theworst case of ergot poisoning they had ever seen.Having heard enough, he returned to Boleskine. Here he wrote “Rosa Inferni,” asequel to “Rosa Mundi,” thus continuing what would become a cycle of four poemschronicling the phases of his relationship with Rose. He also wrapped up work onthe manuscripts of Orpheus and Gargoyles.Crowley’s works appeared under the SPRT imprint faster than they’d come outbefore, with ten new works and various reissues appearing at this time.The first of these was The Argonauts (1904), influenced by Crowley’s exposure toHinduism. Reviewers generally liked the writing in this five-act verse play, butconsidered it uneven. This comment underscores the disadvantage to Crowley’smethod of publication: unable to criticize his own works, he published books ashe wrote them without an editor to identify their weaknesses. Furthermore, thelimited print runs—generally one hundred to two hundred copies—left littleopportunity for his name to become known.The Book of the Goetia of Solomon the King (1904) was Mathers’s translation ofthe Key of Solomon, which Crowley had acquired during his raid of the GD’sSecond Order headquarters in April 1900. Although Crowley was responsible foremendations, introduction, and notes, Mathers is credited only on the title pageas “A Dead Hand.”One hundred copies of his next work, Why Jesus Wept: A Study of Society (1904),sold to subscribers at two guineas through a tacky advertisement:WHY JESUS WEPTbyAleister CrowleyWho has now ceased to weepWith the original Dedication;With the advertisement which has brought Peace and Joy to so many a sad heart!!With the slip containing the solution of the difficulty on pages 75–76!!!With the improper joke on page 38!!!!With the beetle-crushing retort to Mr. G.K. Chesterton’s aborted attack upon theSword of Song!!!!!With the specially contributed Appeal from the Poet’s Mamma!!!!!!Look slippy, boys! Christ may come at any moment. He won’t like it if youhaven’t read the book about His melt. … I say: Buy! Buy Now! Quick! Quick!My Unborn Child screams “Buy!”The poetic play, its title from John 11:35, is a religious satire explaining whyJesus wept. It reprints a letter from Crowley’s mother, wherein she begs herstrayed son to give up his evil ways. Crowley signed the dedication in Hebrewsuch that the name “Aleister E. Crowley” added up to 666, as it did on the coverof The Sword of Song; he dedicated the book to Jesus, Lady Scott (a portion ofwhose anatomy he compared to a piece of wet chamois), his Buddhist friends, hisunborn child, and, particularly, G. K. Chesterton, to whom Crowley wrote, “Aloneamong the puerile apologists of your detestable religion you hold a reasonablymystic head above the tides of criticism.” Inserted into the book was aneight-page pamphlet reprinting Chesterton’s “Mr. Crowley and the Creeds,” alongwith Crowley’s rebuttals: “The Creed of Mr. Chesterton” and “A Child ofEphraim.” Chesterton appears in the book, along with “The Marquis of Glenstrae”and a Horny-Handed Plymouth Brother.In Residence: The Don’s Guide to Cambridge (1904), dedicated to Ivor Back,reprinted Crowley’s undergraduate verse; The Granta, Cambridge University’sundergraduate magazine, replied:Oh, Crowley, name for future fame!(Do you pronounce it Croully?)Whate’er the worth of this your mirthIt reads a trifle foully.Cast before swine these pearls of thine,O, great Aleister Crolley“Granta” to-day, not strange to say,Repudiates them wholly.14 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts014]Several of these books included the SPRT catalog and an entry form for acontest: Crowley was offering £100 as grand prize for the best essay written onhis works. He designed the scheme to promote sales of his “Collected Works” (seebelow) and the overstock of his previous works. The flier is every bit as sillyas that for Why Jesus Wept:THE CHANCE OF THE YEAR!THE CHANCE OF THE CENTURY!!THE CHANCE OF THE GEOLOGIC PERIOD!!!A CAREER FOR AN ESSAY15 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts015]By this time, SPRT’s booklist numbered nineteen titles, with volume one of thecollected works offered at cost to any competitor, who was free to write eithera hostile or appreciative essay. His first editions were also for sale, pricedfrom twenty-one shillings (Aceldama, Jezebel, Alice, Goetia, and Why Jesus Wept)to one shilling (Appeal to the American Republic, The Star and the Garter).The Works of Aleister Crowley, volume 1, covered his books from Aceldama toTannhäuser (omitting the anonymous publication White Stains), edited andfootnoted by Ivor Back. The uneven quality of his writing notwithstanding,Crowley’s accomplishment, at age twenty-nine, of a three-volume collection ofhis published works remains remarkable.Five hundred copies of Oracles: The Autobiography of an Art (1905) were alsoavailable, with the SPRT catalog bound in at the end. This book was a collectionof poetic odds and ends, including his early work and selections from theunpublished Green Alps. The author described this book as “a hodgepodge ofdejecta membra … [containing] beastlinesses too foul to cumber up my manuscriptcase any more.”16 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts016]Crowley, ever searching for new ways to make his works rare and desirable,issued the two-volume Orpheus: A Lyrical Legend (1905) in five editionsdistinguished by the covers’ elemental colors (either white, yellow, red, blue,or olive green). A one-volume edition was also available on India paper. Of thiswork, Crowley later wrote, “They had never satisfied me.”17[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts017]Rosa Mundi: A Poem (1905), published by Philippe Renouard, featured thefifteen-page title piece and a lithograph of one of the sketches Rodin had givenhim. Gargoyles: Being Strangely Wrought Images of Life and Death (1906) markedwhat AC considered a new phase of his work. Finally, in addition to publishingnew works, Crowley reissued some of his older books in inexpensive editions,including The Star and the Garter, Songs of the Spirit, and Alice: An Adultery.Although the effort would not make Crowley famous, this publishing and publicityspree would soon mean more to Crowley than he ever dreamed.Jacot-Guillarmod arrived at Boleskine on April 27 and presented the lord of themanor with a copy of his book about their climb on K2, Six Mois dansl’Himalaya.18 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts018] Crowley recalledhow Guillarmod spent his hours on the glacier keeping a journal—it was probablythe only thing that kept him from snapping like the others—and gladly acceptedthe gift. He reciprocated with a copy of Snowdrops from a Curate’s Garden.During his visit, Guillarmod and Crowley discussed their respective adventures.When Guillarmod began to boast of his big game hunting, it piqued Crowley’sinterest. “Have you ever seen a haggis?” he asked.“Haggis? What’s that?” the Swiss asked.Haggis was a Highland dish of minced sheep’s heart, liver, and kidneys boiledwith oatmeal in the animal’s stomach. Drawing a dramatic breath, Crowleyexplained: “I am one of the only people who would dare answer that question. Ahaggis is a wild rogue ram.” Guillarmod knew of Burma’s wild buffaloes, and ofelephants that were thrown out of their herds. Although he had never heard of ahaggis, he equated it with these creatures. Crowley continued, “Just as rogueelephants are taboo, so is the haggis sacred in Scotland. They are rare, and,when found, must only be touched by the chief of the clan. They are also verydangerous.”Guillarmod nodded gravely, suitably impressed. It gave Crowley a wonderful idea.Two days later, Crowley and Guillarmod rested in the billiard room afterbreakfast. Their idyll was interrupted when Crowley’s servant, Hugh Gillies,burst breathlessly into the room, panic and urgency in his eyes. “My lord,” heblurted out, “there is a haggis on the hill.”Guillarmod’s gaze shot from Crowley to the servant and back again. AC, doing hisbest to keep a straight face, nodded in acknowledgment. “Good man,” he mutteredas he walked over to his gun case. “The best servant I’ve had.” He grabbed his.577 Double Express and handed Guillarmod a 10–bore Paradox with steel-corebullets. “That gun,” he told Guillarmod, “will bring down an elephant with ashot. You may need it. Now fall to. We haven’t a moment to lose.”Crowley led Gillies, Guillarmod and Rose on a low-crouching, tiptoed coursethrough icy rain that chilled them by the time they reached the artificial troutlake on his estate. Playing his part to the hilt, Crowley insisted, “We mustwade through the lake to throw the haggis off our scent.” So, with guns heldhigh overhead, they marched through the neck-high water. Emerging on the otherside, they climbed the hill on all fours. Stealthy and cautious, they finallyreached the hilltop ninety minutes after leaving the house. Crowley looked overto the servant. “Where is it?”Gillies pointed a trembling finger through the mist. “Th-there.”By this time, Guillarmod was so tightly wound that he advanced and fired at thebeast in the mist. As the explosion of gunfire echoed through the hills, Crowleygrabbed Guillarmod’s arm to restrain him. “If you value your life, stay whereyou are.” Lord Boleskine stepped into the gray haze. There, he found the ram hehad purchased in town from Farmer McNab and tethered on the hill. Both bulletsfrom the rifle had struck and expanded, completely blowing away the ram’s rearsection. Crowley arranged to have the ram cooked and served for dinner the nextevening. Guillarmod, none the wiser, had the animal’s head mounted on a plaqueas a trophy.19 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts019]As great an adventure as the haggis was, Guillarmod did not come to Boleskine tohunt rogue rams. He had come to discuss mountains. Six Mois dans l’Himalayachronicled their attempt on K2, and he again desired that type of experience. Hesuggested to Crowley that they climb Kangchenjunga, the third highest mountainin the world.Located twelve miles south of the main Himalayan chain, it was only forty-fivemiles north of Darjeeling, eighty miles east of Mount Everest. Its nameliterally meant “Five Peaks” for its pentad of summits ranging in height from25,925 to 28,169 feet. These pinnacles were buttressed by huge ridges withseveral lesser though nevertheless spectacular peaks of their own; runningeast-west and north-south, they formed a giant X around the range. At 28,169feet, Kangchenjunga was less than one hundred feet smaller than K2.Climbers considered it the most treacherous mountain in the world. Receivingmore precipitation than virtually any other mountain, hundreds of feet of snowand ice plastered its face and slowly plowed down the mountain in the form ofglaciers, and its millions of tons of debris could easily tumble down as anavalanche. Its history testified to its inhospitability: in January 1849—whenmountaineering was still in its infancy—Antarctic explorer Sir Joseph DaltonHooker (1817–1911) attempted Kangchenjunga, but snow turned him back. Returningthree months later, difficult conditions cut his climb short. Three years later,in 1852, an earthquake brought thousands of square yards of debris down themountain, preempting Captain J. L. Sherwill’s attempt.20[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts020] W. W. Graham claimed to havecircumnavigated the mountain in 1882 and to have climbed two of its lesser peaksin October 1883, but the account was controversial. Douglas Freshfield’s 1899tour around the base of Kangchenjunga was cut short when a storm dumpedtwenty-seven inches of rain on Darjeeling in twenty-eight hours. In 1905,Kangchenjunga remained unclimbed.21[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts021]The challenge appealed to Crowley. Disappointed by his abortive attempt on K2,he saw an opportunity to get it right. He insisted on leading the expedition,and he and Guillarmod both put five thousand francs into expenses. Crowley,realizing what little time they had if they wished to attempt the mountain thatsummer, devised a plan: Guillarmod would go to London and round up provisionswhile Crowley proceeded to Darjeeling to arrange transport, hire porters, andcoordinate details with the local government.When Crowley set off for London on May 6 to get his affairs in order, he wasprepared to die. He left written instructions for his body to be embalmed,dressed in magical garb, and sealed in a vault on ground chosen and consecratedby his GD mentor, George Cecil Jones. In London, he sought Eckenstein, whoconsidered the adventure foolhardy and declined to participate. Undaunted,Crowley gathered provisions and proceeded to Darjeeling. On May 12, Crowleysailed for India, where a month earlier a severe earthquake had killed over19,000 people in its northern territory. He arrived in Bombay on June 9 andheaded for Darjeeling the same day. From there he could have seenKangchenjunga—and even the Himalayas—if not for the rain: it never stopped, andleft everything damp and musty. Moving into the Drum Druid Hotel, he concludedhe simply didn’t like Darjeeling.While in India, Crowley kept up on business by mail. His contest for the bestessay on the works of Aleister Crowley had drawn a contestant in the form of J.F. C. Fuller (1876–1966), a young army captain stationed at Lucknow. He hadordered a copy of Why Jesus Wept based on a review in The Literary Guide; thebook impressed him and, finding the contest entry form, he decided to try hisluck. Since he had none of the poet’s other works, Crowley sent along copies ofeverything. This included volume two of the Works of Aleister Crowley, which wasstill in press.To prepare for the expedition, Crowley sent four tons of food to be taken asclose as possible to the Yalung Glacier, where they would begin their ascent;this was conveyed by 130 porters provided by the Indian government. On the lastday of July—having weathered a monsoon and mechanicaldifficulties—Jacot-Guillarmod arrived with two other Swiss climbers.22[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts022] Crowley and a servant met themat the train station to help bring their bags to the hotel, where the managerhad reserved for them his best rooms.The team that Jacot-Guillarmod had assembled was solid. Charles Adolphe Reymond(1875–1914) of Fontaine, Val de Ruz, was a Swiss Army officer with Alpineexperience, quiet and dour. He called himself a Lebenskünstler, or connoisseurof the art of living. His small pension afforded him a pleasant and simplelifestyle; for instance, he once spent an entire winter at Sainte-Croix,Switzerland, skiing and lazing in the sun. He was a natural and skilled climber,having worked with a guide primarily in the Valais and Mont Blanc chains. Untilbeing enlisted for this climb, he worked as an editor at the Swiss telegraphicagency in Geneva.23 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts023] Reymondquipped that the primary purpose of the expedition was to have a good time;beating the world altitude record was secondary.24[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts024] AC liked him: he had good senseand seemed stable.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_026_r1.jpg]Charles Adolphe Reymond (1875–1914) of the Kangchenjunga expedition. (photocredit 6.1) [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c06-fig001a]Crowley also liked Reymond’s companion, Alexis Pache (c. 1874–1905) of Morges,Switzerland, whom he found to be an unaffected and unassuming gentleman. Agedthirty-one, he was the only son among the four children of Charles LouisFrederick Pache and Henriette Emma (née Cart); his sisters were Helene MarieSuzanne, Marguerite, and Marie.25[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts025] Like Reymond, Pache was a Swissarmy officer, having become a dragoon lieutenant in 1894.26[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts026] Between 1899 and 1901, he spenttwenty months in the Boer War at Natal, fighting the British on behalf of theBoer government. He returned home to some celebrity: A three-part interviewconcerning his observations on the war and the respect he found for hisindefatigable and chivalrous opponents ran in the Gazette de Lausanne, and waspicked up from the London Times to the New Zealand Star.27[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts027] Although lacking in climbingexperience, he was energetic and adventure-loving, joining the expedition mainlyfor the opportunity to hunt in the Himalayas.28[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts028] Indeed, Jacot-Guillarmod notedhow excited he got seeing monkeys and other animals from the train toDarjeeling.29 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts029] Pache also broughtalong several glass specimen vials to collect indigenous ants for ProfessorAuguste-Henri Forel (1848–1931), a distinguished Swiss psychiatrist andneuroanatamist who retired to devote himself to myrmecology.30[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts030]AC also invited along Alcesti C. Rigo de Righi, the Italian manager of the DrumDruid Hotel on the Mall and proprietor of the Woodlands Hotel adjacent to therailway station.31 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts031] The latterwas Darjeeling’s leading inn when American humorist Mark Twain (1835–1910)visited in 1896,32 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts032] and BaronessMary Victoria Curzon of Kedleston (1870–1906), after nine days’ stay in 1900,raved about how “M. Righi took the greatest pains to see that everything wasnice.”33 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts033] Climber CharlesGranville Bruce (1866–1939) noted that de Righi was “always ready to assist anytraveller to the upper ranges,”34[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts034] while English illustrator WalterCrane (1845–1915), visiting in 1906, remarked, “He occasionally entertained hisguests by a lecture in the evenings, illustrated by photographic slides taken onthe expedition.”35 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts035] Although deRighi was a novice climber, he spoke Hindustani and Tibetan, which Crowleyconsidered invaluable. Plus, “he spoke English like a native.”36[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts036] Thus, de Righi became theexpedition’s transport manager. Much like Guillarmod, de Righi also broughtalong his camera to document their historic climb. These five—Crowley,Guillarmod, Reymond, Pache, and de Righi—made up the party.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_027_r1.jpg]Drum Druid Hotel manager Alcesti C. Rigo de Righi. (photo credit 6.2)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c06-fig002a]It was raining so incessantly that Darjeeling’s average annual rainfall of 120inches was already reached in July, and the downpour continued throughout theparty’s nine days there. The rain was so persistent that they only caughtfleeting glimpses of the famous view of Kangchenjunga.37[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts037] On Tuesday, August 8, 1905, at10:16 a.m., they marched in the pouring rain on their winding path through thecountryside toward Kangchenjunga, with several thousand pounds of food, luggage,and camping equipment carried by an additional hundred porters. Even at thisearly stage, the expedition was plagued by problematic porters: because of thethin atmosphere at this altitude, it was a difficult haul. Several porters snuckoff daily, taking with them days’ worth of rations, requiring one of the team tobe designated to bring up the rear. The explorers also resorted to tactics likeoffering a pack of cigarettes to the first ten porters to reach the next day’sdestination. To top it off, they discovered that the 130 porters they’d sentahead had still not arrived; thus, de Righi went ahead to search for them. Itwas a sharp contrast to the dependable help they had on K2.38[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts038]At the last possible moment, word arrived that they had received officialpermission to cross into Nepal, which was normally prohibited to Europeans;39[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts039] this allowed them to take themost direct route to the mountain, marching north from the Singalila Range tothe Yalung Valley. On arrival, the 130 porters supplied by the governmentdropped their supplies at the foot of the glacier and left, refusing to go anyfurther. To the Tibetans, mountains were strongholds of the gods, and theseporters feared offending them. Between this and the other defectors, this leftthem with eighty porters.On August 21, Crowley left Pache in charge of Camp 1 while he ventured up theglacier and set up Camp 2 at 14,000–15,000 feet, about two miles fromKangchenjunga’s peak. Here, two pinnacles were visible, although clouds obscuredthe main peak, Kangchenjunga itself. The sight of their goal filled Crowley withexcitement: He was in top shape, the weather was good, and the path looked easy.He was sure this ascent would make his adventure on K2 seem like a bad dream.Guillarmod was not so optimistic. The sight of the glacier discouraged him: hehad never seen one so tangled and torn, and the west ridge looked like it wasconstantly rained with avalanches. He declared this approach unclimbable, andobjected to attempting it. That Crowley preferred this approach added moretension to what was shaping up to be a stressful expedition.Crowley had good reason to choose this course: in 1899, Freshfield, based on hisreconnaissance of the mountain, recommended the nearby ridge as a means ofovercoming the steep glacier. In the view of the team that later surveyed themountain in 1954, Guillarmod overreacted while Crowley formulated a reasonable,albeit optimistic, plan.40 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts040]By the next day, Crowley had already picked out the site for Camp 3 with hisbinoculars. Heading west up the steep slopes, he set up camp in the heart ofKangchenjunga’s basin. From here, he could survey the surrounding landscape. Theroute to the summit appeared to be clear.Later that day, from Camp 3 he could also see as Guillarmod and his men came upthe ridge and set up their own camp. AC harangued Guillarmod for his failure tofollow orders, while Guillarmod claimed Crowley had marked the path poorly andleft him no choice but to take control of his own men. Such miscommunicationstypified the expedition.Guillarmod and Crowley clashed again over the march to Camp 4.41[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts041] Crowley wished to start early totake advantage of the clear weather; so he rose at 3 a.m. and prepared his menby six. Guillarmod, however, insisted he wait until eleven so the men could warmin the sunlight. “That’s absurd,” Crowley retorted, and set forth. He found theroute steep and slick, more difficult than he expected. In a series of shortsprints, the team reached the flat ridge at the top of the slope, the site forCamp 4. Crowley thought the spot was a little narrow. Looking up the hill, theonly other likely campsite was another three hours’ climb. He noticed Reymondand Guillarmod were exhausted, and opted to set up camp where they were.After putting a rope down the slope for the porters to retrieve supplies frombelow, he sent word to Pache: Camp 4 is established, move from Camp 2 to Camp 3.Crowley was surprised when Pache climbed up to Camp 4, reporting that de Righiwas not sending up necessary supplies, and they were now low on petroleum andfood. Owing to these conditions, some of the porters deserted; one of them,going off alone, had disappeared. Jacot-Guillarmod went down the next day toinvestigate, and discovered the missing man’s badly mutilated corpse where heslipped and fell on the rocks 1,500 feet below. Examining the remaining porters,Guillarmod noticed some of them exhibiting altitude sickness and ophthalmia,their eyes bloodshot and painful.42[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts042]Leaving Guillarmod in charge of Camp 4, Crowley, Reymond and Pache advanced toCamp 5 at an elevation of 20,343 feet. Waiting for supplies that never arrived,a frustrated Crowley again observed how failure to follow orders stalled theirprogress. Finally, on August 31, the team pressed on. At this point, Crowleyrealized ascent would be more difficult than he initially estimated: themountain was steep at this point, and sported many granite precipices.With porters cutting steps out of the ice, they climbed quickly to a height of21,000 feet. Crowley paused, watching small hunks of broken ice scuttle down thehillside as the workers hacked away. He noticed a few bits of snow also skimmingalong the surface. When a hiss like hot water coming to a boil reached his ears,he knew an avalanche was beginning. AC ordered the men to brace themselves onthe steps, knowing they’d be safe there. They did as the sahib instructed. Oneporter, however, panicked and began untying his rope in order to sprint acrossthe sliding snow. Crowley again instructed him to stay put. When he ignored thecommand, AC used the only swift and sure solution: He knocked the porter upsidethe head with the flat of his ax.43[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts043]Panic far outstripped the size of the avalanche, and the snowslide passed themwithout incident. Nevertheless, the party called it a day and returned to Camp5. There, gossip among the porters changed the snowslide into a cataclysm andthe blow to the porter’s head into a violent assault. That night, severalfrightened men deserted, complaining to Guillarmod that Crowley was beatingthem. Crowley would later claim that the porters were exaggerating the incidentduring the avalanche. But Jacot-Guillarmod, despite the porters having beenunruly and very difficult to keep in line, believed them.44[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts044] Indeed, Reymond recorded in hisdiary that he and Pache had observed Crowley at Camp 5 beating old Penduck,alternately kicking him and hitting him with his alpenstock as the porter laidin the snow, howled, and pleaded with him to stop.45[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts045] The doctor decided matters hadgone far enough.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_028_r1.jpg]Photo of Kangchenjunga by Jacot-Guillarmod, showing the party’s route up themountain and the location of several of its camps. The camp numbers differ fromCrowley’s: VII is Crowley’s Camp 5, and VI is Camp 4. (photo credit 6.3)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c06-fig003a]The next morning, as Crowley and his remaining company prepared another attempton the slope, Guillarmod unexpectedly ascended to Camp 5 with de Righi and hisparty behind him. What the hell are they doing here? Crowley wondered,dumbfounded. He thought they had supplies but, learning they had none, AC onceagain pondered: What the hell are they doing here?The answer was simple: mutiny.Jacot-Guillarmod had had enough. The unfollowed orders, fleeing porters, andhazardous ascent convinced him to hold a meeting of the expedition’s principals.The climbers voted to oust AC and make Jacot-Guillarmod leader. “You may be agood climber,” the doctor told Crowley, “but you’re a bad general.”46[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts046] The doctor even convinced deRighi, who ascended with him, into backing this plan. Although hurt, Crowleymerely scoffed, “There is no provision for this stupidity in our contract.”“It is only a piece of paper,” Jacot-Guillarmod replied coolly; it was his rightas initiator of the expedition.47[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts047] Assuming command at 5 p.m. onSeptember 1, 1905, the doctor declared the expedition over, effectiveimmediately. Crowley watched helplessly as Jacot-Guillarmod wrested theexpedition from his hands; watched as all the porters, with insufficient roomfor all of them at Camp 5, descended to take shelter behind the rocks at Camp 4;watched as Pache, his campmate, sided with Guillarmod. Only Reymond (atJacot-Guillarmod’s request) remained with Crowley.They’re fools, AC thought. None of them know the first thing about Himalayanclimbing. And there they were, preparing to climb down even though night wouldfall before they finished. As his friends left, Crowley implored—to Pache inparticular—to wait until morning, when it would be safer. “If you go now, you’llbe dead within ten minutes.”Deaf ears turned away and started down the mountain. Crowley retired to histent, Reymond thought, with the injured air of a deposed monarch.Connected by one hundred feet of rope, Jacot-Guillarmod, de Righi, Pache, andthree porters with crampons—Bahadur Lama, Thenduck, and Phubu48[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts048]—began their descent, withJacot-Guillarmod and de Righi in the lead. As they turned a sharp corner of theslope, a porter slipped. “No,” Pache cursed to himself in split seconds, “thedescent has barely started.” He watched helplessly as the porter fell over theedge, taking the next porter in line with him. “No,” Pache lamented: “Seventeenporters just passed through here without a hitch.” By the time Pache realized hewas tied to the same rope as the two falling porters, he was also plummetingdown the slope, taking another porter with him.Below, Guillarmod and de Righi saw their four comrades plunging toward them.Preparing to intercept their sprawling friends, they spread their legs, plantedthemselves on the path, and braced themselves. As the four falling bodies slidby, they caught one of them. The rope which encircled the waists of the otherthree snapped tight. For a moment, they stopped.Then the snow beneath them slid.A fifty-yard-wide avalanche of snow started down the hill, and de Righi slipped.Guillarmod held him with one arm while his other gripped his ax—the only thingkeeping them in place. He held with all his strength, but the five men were justtoo heavy. Guillarmod’s fingers slid off the ax handle despite themselves, andthe avalanche swept all six men down the mountain. Guillarmod tried to grab anax in his path, but everything was happening too quickly; all he could do waspaddle to keep on top of the sliding snow.In five seconds, it was over: they fell into a crevice, and Guillarmod watchedhis friends vanish under the falling snow. Then darkness and debris engulfed himas well.Breathing was difficult at first. He couldn’t move, and he wasn’t even fullyconscious. Gasping for air, he realized he was cold, and then he realized whathad just happened. Guillarmod pulled himself free by his rope and found de Righiat the other end, on top of the crevice. He was pinned down by Guillarmod on theone side of his rope and by their buried comrades on the other. Had Guillarmoddied, he would have been trapped there and frozen to death. As it was, afterGuillarmod freed him, he was so shaken he was unable to stand.Guillarmod attempted to rescue the others alone. He tugged on the rope which ranvertically into the snow-filled crevice below, knowing four men were on theother end somewhere. With no tools with which to dig, he used his bare hands.Soon, de Righi joined in, but it was just too slow. The doctor cried out indesperation, “Help! Reymond, help! Bring ice picks!”“What’s that?” Reymond asked.“What?” Crowley asked with sour disinterest.“It sounds like de Righi and Guillarmod yelling.”He shrugged. “So? They’ve been yelling all day.”Reymond still had his boots on. “I think I should go and look.”“Well, send word back if you need help.” Crowley obviously didn’t mean it. Hefigured Reymond was deserting, too. He remained in his tent, drinking tea. Whenhe received no word from Reymond, AC rolled over in his sleeping bag and fellasleep, alone at Camp 5.So Crowley describes this incident. The account in Reymond’s diary differs:Hearing the cry for help, Reymond, who still had his boots on, ran out of theirtent, looked over the edge, and saw Jacot-Guillarmod and de Righi pulling at arope that disappeared into the snow at their feet.“Where’s Pache?” Reymond shouted.“Buried in the snow with three porters,” Jacot-Guillarmod replied. Reymond couldhear the deep anguish in his voice. “Come on, hurry!”Reymond ran back to the tent and reported to Crowley, “Pache and three portershave run into an avalanche.” Crowley didn’t move, but remarked that thestupidity of people could fill an entire avalanche. Not waiting for orders,Reymond packed food into a backpack, put on his crampons, and headed down thepath. To his great surprise, Crowley did not follow.49[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts049]Reymond looked like an angel at the top of the crevice, looking down on thedoomed party and asking, “Do you need help?” After he rounded up axes and joinedthem in the pit, they dug at the tons of snow and ice that covered Pache and theothers. They worked in turns, individually digging with an ax in theever-deepening pit and hacking out more snow until white powder coated theirbodies and their fingers felt like they were aflame. When darkness came with nosign of their comrades in the snow, they knew the truth:Pache and the porters were already dead.Crowley awoke the next morning and climbed down to Camp 4 to look around. Hethought he heard voices, but saw no one. When he reached Camp 3, he foundGuillarmod badly bruised and his back hurt; de Righi’s ribs were also bruised,and he complained of other injuries. Then he found out: Pache and his three bestporters were dead at the bottom of an avalanche.Anguish and anger mixed within Crowley: his rash comrades had died as the resultof their ill-conceived coup. “The conduct of the mountaineers amounted tomanslaughter. By breaking their agreement, they had assumed fullresponsibility,” he wrote bitterly.50[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts050] Reymond recorded in his journalthat Crowley, to the surprise of the others, explained that he thought thevictims had been thrown on the rocks like the last porter, which is why hedidn’t come to help the night before.51[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts051] That evening, Crowley tookReymond’s place in de Righi’s tent (forcing Reymond into Jacot-Guillarmod’s),and the next morning, around 11 o’clock on September 3, AC left for Darjeeling.He wired his accounts to The Pioneer and Daily Mail, and awaited the rest of theparty.The others, meanwhile, stayed behind to recover the dead. Three days of diggingfinally uncovered the deceased climbers. A lama in the group said prayers overthe bodies. and the porters lowered their three dead companions, arms crossed,into a crevasse and covered them with snow. “The god of Kangchenjunga tookthem,” they declared fatalistically, “and they will spend eternity near him.”They carried Pache to Camp 3, where fifty porters helped erect a memorial cairn.Reymond spent three days engraving Pache’s name and the date of his death onto aslab of granite. The moraine hillock where he died to this day is known asPache’s Grave.The tension on the mountain that led to Jacot-Guillarmod assuming control of theexpedition spilled into the world’s newspapers at what the Alpine Club called“lamentable length.”52 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts052] Initialnews of Pache’s death was reported widely, including in the Manchester Guardian,Journal de Genève, Science, and the Alpine Journal.53[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts053] Because Crowley returned toDarjeeling ahead of the rest of the party, his were the first press releases toreach print. He had been documenting the climb’s progress in a series ofarticles for The Pioneer titled “On the Kinchin Lay.”54[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts054] His latest installment describedthe tragedy and placed the blame squarely on his teammates, saying that theaccident occurred in the course of his team abandoning him on the mountain; theyproceeded “ignorant or careless of the commonest precautions for securing thesafety of the men.”55 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts055] Crowleydescribed sending Reymond to investigate the ensuing avalanche, and evenadmitted that he remained in his tent:Reymond hastily set out to render what help he could, though it was perfectlyout of the question to render effective aid. Had the doctor possessed the commonhumanity or commonsense to leave me a proper complement of men at Camp V,instead of doing his utmost to destroy my influence, I should have been in aposition to send help. As it was I could do nothing more than send out Reymondon the forlorn hope. Not that I was over anxious in the circumstances to renderhelp. A mountain ’accident of this sort is one of the things for which I have nosympathy whatever56 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts056][images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_029_r1.jpg]Alexis Pache’s grave on Kangchenjunga. (photo credit 6.4)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c06-fig004a]This sparked a war of words between the expedition’s principals, beginning witha detailed rejoinder by de Righi, countersigned by Jacot-Guillarmod and Reymond,in the September 29 edition of The Pioneer. Regarding the most serious charges,de Righi wrote:Mr. Crowley further says that we left him without men. Every coolie with him,owing I suppose to fear of the mountain and of Mr. Crowley, had bolted the nightbefore, so that he only had with him Thenduck senior, who, after his treatmentat Mr. Crowley’s hands and feet, begged of us to be taken down. This was theonly man we deprived Mr. Crowley of; as of Mr. Pache deciding to come down withus (he was not persuaded by the Doctor), his servant, Bahadur Lama, came downwith him, making thus our party up to six men. We, of course, could not refusethem, so the charge that we left him without effective help, our answer is, weonly took one man who was sick and bruised. He further states that had theDoctor possessed the common humanity and common sense to leave him men he couldhave sent an effective rescue party. This Doctor Guillarmod was unable to do asno coolie then would stop with such a Sahib, who convinced his coolies to marchwith the business end of his ice-axe or the toe of his well shod boot.57[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts057]In his final installment (penned the day after the accident but allegedly notedited in response to de Righi’s letter), Crowley conceded that his last reportwas written on the heels of the accident while in a charged emotional state andwithout all the facts. “I was under the (false) impression that the Doctor andRighi were on one rope, and the rest … on another. What I supposed to be thematter was that these five had been seen to fall over the cliffs on to the lowerglacier.” So far, so good. However, his list of reasons for not rendering helpafter the avalanche shockingly concluded, “The doctor is old enough to rescuehimself and nobody would want to rescue Righi.” The article ended with thefollowing dig at de Righi: “It is only fair to add that on my return I found (inspite of the absence of the brilliant young manager) that the food andattendance at this hotel had very much improved, even to excellence.”58[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts058]This drama replayed itself in Switzerland, when these stories were picked up andrun by the Journal de Genève and Gazette de Lausanne et Journal Suisse. Theseinclude de Righi’s account, a detailed series on the climb by Jacot-Guillarmod,and conclude with Reymond’s account of the climb in the February 5, 1906,Journal de Genève.59 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts059] Theseaccounts maintained that Crowley lacked the skills necessary to lead theexpedition effectively. The clash ended quietly, however, when Guillarmodthreatened, if Crowley did not desist, to accuse him of fraud, sending a copy ofSnowdrops along with the complaint. Crowley relented. In the months to follow,Jacot-Guillarmod would go on to report the tale of their expedition to theFrench Alpine Club, the Swiss Alpine Club, and the Geographical Society ofGeneva.60 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts060]In the end, the image that stuck not only with his peers in the climbingcommunity but also with the general public was an unflattering portrait ofCrowley painted by his own words, as quoted above. If his flippancy did not seemcold enough, his later letters commented that although it would have taken himonly ten minutes to dress, he did not do so because there was no word fromReymond. Writing in the Daily Mail, Crowley added, “I am not altogetherdisappointed with the present results. I know enough to make certain of successof another year with a properly equipped and disciplined expedition.”61[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts061] Furthermore, the attacks on theAlpine Club couched within his narrative further drew the ire of fellowclimbers. As one person wrote of Crowley’s first article for The Pioneer:From the tone of it, I judge him to be a disappointed candidate for membershipof the Alpine Club, to which I may add, I have not the privilege of belonging.The sport of mountaineering will certainly suffer no loss if Kinchenjungapermanently effaces this polished individual.62[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts062]In the end, Crowley painted himself as a detached and uncaring leader who simplydid not want to rescue his comrades.Kangchenjunga was history. The crushing, embittering experience scarred Crowley:he would never again make a climb of any consequence, and Kangchenjunga phobiawould haunt him even in his last days.Long after this tragic attempt, the Five Peaks remained elusive: Raeburn andCrawford’s 1920 attempt was cut short because they were inadequately equipped.In 1929, snowstorms at 24,272 feet turned back Bauer’s expedition. The followingyear, Dyhrenfurth lost a porter in an avalanche and abandoned the peak in favorof a smaller mountain. Bauer tried again in 1931 but gave up at 25,500 feet whenhe encountered an unclimbable slope. Cooke’s 1937 expedition failed similarly,while Frey died in his 1951 attempt with Lewis.Not until 1954 did John Kempe’s expedition successfully conduct reconnaissanceof Kangchenjunga’s southwest approach, paving the way for the British expeditionthat conquered the mountain in 1955.63[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts063]And not until the twenty-first century—a century after this fateful climb—haveCrowley’s mountaineering accomplishments been seriously reevaluated. ColinWells, author of A Brief History of British Mountaineering (2001), called him in2002, “one of the most accomplished and talented climbers in his era,” andquoted Mick Fowler, who repeated many of Crowley’s Beachy Head climbseighty-five years later, as saying admiringly,Crowley was outrageous! He was obviously good; something of a star rock climber,in fact.… He was light years ahead of his time in his attitude to tacklingvertical chalk cliffs. The ground he covered was without doubt amongst the mosttechnically difficult in Britain, but his achievements were never reallyappreciated in his lifetime.64 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts064]Similarly, Isserman, Weaver, and Molenaar conceded in Fallen Giants,From far outside the privileged purlieus of the Alpine Club and the RoyalGeographical Society (who between them did in fact conspire to diminish or evenerase Crowley’s achievement), he found his way to the world’s second- andthird-highest mountains and somehow discerned and reconnoitered the routes bywhich they would first be climbed.65[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts065]Finally, Canadian Alpine Journal editor Geoff Powter noted in Strange andDangerous Dreams, “Crowley’s rehabilitation in climbing circles has been asdramatic as it has been elsewhere,”66[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts066] due in no small part to the factthat the sport’s vanguard and rock stars of today, living on the edge, sharemore in common with Crowley than they do with his staid and proper peers.Life looked pretty grim. Crowley was a man who had climbed among the highestmountains in the world, only to have his first leadership snatched from him andhis men buried in ice. As a poet, he had published so many books that hiscollected Works were available, even though the originals never sold. He hadtraveled around the world, and was now halfway around it again and finding itstale. And he was a master of magic who chose to forget his experience in Cairo.Now on the verge of his thirtieth birthday, life stared him in the face.What next?Empty and lost, he cabled Rose to join him in India and wrote soul-searchingletters to his brother-in-law. Everything had soured, seemed stale. Even hispoetry, which he had all but forgotten lately, was doubtful:I have thought of trying serious writing again, but I am 30 and a proud Papa.Shelley and Keats never touched 30—that day is over for me. I think some smallbits of work are classical with theirs, I must leave it at that. Anyway, I hopeI shan’t simply go bad. At least I am certain to avoid the blunder of making agood thing and copying it forever.67[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts067]The only thing remaining was the truth that he had realized back at Cambridge,when he grasped for something in the world that could stir him: magic. Herealized he had to change the world. Thus, The Sword of Song became hismanifesto, and he wrote eagerly to Kelly:This book has been boycotted by English publishers and printers. I am in armsagainst a world, but after five years of folly and weakness, miscalledpoliteness, tact, discretion, care for the feeling of others, I am weary of it.Did Christ mince his words with the Pharisees? I say today to hell withChristianity, rationalism, Buddhism, all the lumber of the centuries. I bringyou a positive and primaeval fact, magic by name; and with this I will build mea new Heaven and a new Earth. I want none of your faint approval or faintdispraise; I want blasphemy, murder, rape, revolution, anything, bad or good,but strong. I want men behind me, or before me if they can surpass me, but men,men not gentlemen. Bring me your personal vigour; all of it, not your sparevigour. Bring me all the money you have or can force from others. If I can getbut seven such men, the world is at my feet. If ten, Heaven will fall at thesound of one trumpet to arms.68 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts068]By these words he would lead the rest of his life.Crowley kept himself busy waiting for Rose and Lilith to arrive on October 29.He studied Persian, stayed with a maharaja in Moharbhanj, sacrificed a goat toKali, visited his friend Edward Thornton, and went big-game hunting. Travelingto Calcutta, he also went to the infamous Culinga Bazar on October 28 during aboisterous holiday festival. At 10 o’clock in the evening, Crowley paused on thedark streets of the Bazar to revel in the fireworks and celebration until,despite himself, he stopped enjoying it. Amidst the noise and excitement, hefelt uncomfortable.He was being followed.In an effort to shake his pursuer, Crowley ducked into an alley. Troublefollowed him in the form of six figures. AC pressed into the shadows and heldhis breath, hoping his mountain tan and his dark clothes would conceal him untilthe throng passed. Just in case, he placed a tense hand on the Webley revolverin his coat. The first three walked right by him and, for a moment, he thoughtthey hadn’t noticed him.Then they closed in. Strong hands pinned Crowley’s arms to his sides whileothers searched his pockets. “Unhand me!” he barked, hoping an authoritativeEnglishman’s voice would frighten them off. In the glimmer of a distant flare,he caught the glint of a blade and realized his life was worthless in this backalley. His hand, still on the Webley, automatically drew the gun from his pocketand tightened around its trigger. The flash captured the sight of fourwhite-clad figures dropping back and running. Then he found himself in silentdarkness.69 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts069]In the pulse-pounding moments that followed, it never occurred to him that agunshot could pass unnoticed among noisy fireworks. Instead, he franticallyimagined the worst: crowds would soon gather to investigate the commotion. Thepolice would frown upon an Englishman—a foreigner—shooting someone in an alley.He pictured himself in prison somewhere, never to be seen again, and desperatelysought a solution.Recalling how he passed unnoticed on the streets of Mexico City, he thought touse that magic to get him out of this fix. Closing his eyes and calling on hisholy guardian angel for protection, he cast a spell of invisibility upon himselfand slipped down the alley, past the crowds, out of sight.“Go to your room,” Edward Thornton, groggy with sleep, told him that night. “Goto bed. Come around in the morning and I’ll take you to the right man.” Theright man was a solicitor named Garth, who officially advised Crowley to go tothe police with his story. “You’d be acquitted, of course. But you’d be kepthanging about Calcutta indefinitely. An unscrupulous man might hold his tongueand clear out of British India p.d.q.”70[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts070] Crowley waited two days beforedeciding to take action. He didn’t even know if the gunshot had struck anyone.Rose arrived that day with their child, and Thornton threw them a dinner partythat night. Throughout the meal, Thornton caught Crowley’s eye, gesticulated,and held up two fingers. Crowley simply looked back blankly. Thornton finallytook him aside and explained: the bullet had struck two of his assailants, whoconfessed to the crime. The Standard carried the story the next morning; areward was offered for the apprehension of the gunman. Ironically, the sameissue featured an interview with AC as leader of the Kangchenjunga expedition.“Get out,” Thornton advised, “and get out quick.”Heeding Thornton’s advice, Crowley looked at Rose and asked her, “Which will itbe: Persia or China?”“I’m tired of Omar Khayyam,” she remarked. “Let’s go to China.”Rangoon began their journey. Crowley checked Rose and Lilith into a hotel whilehe visited Ananda Metteya, formerly known as Allan Bennett. They discussed theneed for a common language if magic were ever to be studied scientifically,concluding that the system most accessible to Westerners was the kabbalah. Itconvinced Crowley of the importance of tabulating all systems of mysticism andreligion according to the ten spheres and twenty-two paths of the Hebrew Tree ofLife. Three days later, on November 6, Bennett had to return to the monasteryper its rules. Following Allan’s advice on writer’s block, Crowley wrote “TheEyes of the Pharaoh” and what would form chapters I through XX of The HighHistory of Good Sir Palamedes the Saracen Knight, a versified account of thepath of initiation. The effort to write even this much, however, was stupendous.On November 15, the Crowleys boarded the steamship Java for Mandalay. Anartistic and intellectual vacuum within, Crowley spent the voyage leaning overthe railing, watching the crests the boat cut into the water, watching theflying fish dancing along the surface, and trying to wrench some poetry out ofhimself. Finally, in his journal, he recorded, “the misery of this is simplysickening;—I can write no more.”71[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts071]By November 29 they reached Bhamo, forty miles from the Chinese border. Itmarked a new phase in his life. Over the next months, his mundane existencebecame a series of bizarre adventures while his spiritual life became a simpleand stellar affair, yielding to no interference from the mundane world no matterhow crippling.From Bhamo, the three Crowleys, their porters, and Lilith’s nurse began aleisurely journey toward Tengyueh (now called Tengchung), China. All the whileAC brooded about the anomie and purposelessness he felt ever sinceKangchenjunga. Then, on their fourth day from Bhamo, something happened to snapAC out of his existential crisis.Having crossed the river that marked the Chinese frontier, they climbed out of aravine with Crowley bringing up the rear to discourage the porters fromstraggling. At one point, Crowley dismounted his Burmese pony to walk andstretch his legs. Once adequately limbered, he tried to mount the pony. Thebeast, however, reared and sent them both down a forty foot cliff. Laying on theground, looking up at the length of their fall, Crowley waited for the pain ofhis broken body to kick in. When it never did, he realized he was unharmed andmarveled that both he and the horse escaped without a scratch. In that moment,he recalled all his narrow brushes with death: from the bomb he made at agefourteen to the muggers in Calcutta, he concluded his charmed life was beingpreserved for a greater purpose. It resolved his existential crisis.At that moment, Aleister Crowley achieved the rank of Exempt Adept (7°=4°), thehighest grade of the Second Order. With this illumination came a resolve toresume magical work. Daunted by his perceived role as the world’s greatestmagus, Crowley confided in Clifford Bax:It is very easy to get all the keys, invisible and otherwise, into the Kingdom,but the keys are devilish stiff, some of them dampered. I am myself at the endof a little excursion of nearly seven years in Hell, and the illusion of reason,which I thought I had stamped out in ’98, was bossing me. It has now got theboot. But let this tell you that it is one thing to devote your life to magic at20 years old, and another to find at 30 that you are bound to stay a Magus. Thefirst is the folly of a child; the second, the Gate of the Sanctuary.72[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts072]On February 11, Crowley pledged to conduct a magical retirement even as theymarched across China. He devoted the next three days to studying the Goetia forinspiration, then decided once and for all to contact his holy guardian angel.To this end, he decided to recite the Goetia’s Preliminary Invocation every day.Of paramount importance was to perform the invocation daily, unfailingly. Rainor shine, tired or rested, good or bad, he had to do it.He began on February 16, typically doing the invocation, which he calledAugoeides, after Bulwer Lytton’s term for the holy guardian angel, on the astralplane, performing the rite in his imagination as he rode across the countrysideon his pony. He maintained his resolve, performing the ritual every day untilJune 7, when he could continue no longer.China’s Boxer rebellion was well underway when, at the beginning of January1906, the Crowleys stayed at Tengyueh. On January 23 they reached Yungchang(what is now Paoshan), where the mandarin Tao Tai treated them to a twelve-hourbanquet. Chinese New Year followed two days later.After crossing the Mekong river on January 26, Crowley noticed that all hisporters smoked opium in their free time. Although his previous exposure to thedrug through Bennett had been fruitless, Crowley bought an opium pipe to learnabout the fashionable drug that wealthy and intellectual Europeans flocked tothe far and middle east to sample. After five hours and twenty-five pipes, ACexperienced neither euphoria nor tranquility. Regardless, his muse returned, andhe wrote “The King Ghost” and “The Opium Smoker.”From there, the next two months’ journey took them to Yunnan, Mengtsz, Manhao,Hokow, Laokay (now part of northern Vietnam), Yen Bay, and the capital, Hanoi,“but only stayed for lunch.”73 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts073]Toward the end of March, AC decided they would return home by two separateroutes. Crowley wished to stop in America and seek out backers for anotherKangchenjunga expedition while Rose retrieved their hastily abandoned luggagefrom Calcutta, returning to England via the continent. Rose was very annoyedabout being cast off in China with their young daughter to return home alone.Crowley reasoned that, being wanted in Calcutta, he couldn’t return there withher. She finally agreed, with the intent of staying with her father when shearrived in Scotland. She needed his help because she was three months pregnant.Meanwhile, her husband, unknown to her, was on his way to Shanghai to look upElaine Simpson, the former Soror Fidelis. He arrived on April 6. There, he readtarot cards for Elaine and her friends. In private moments, Crowley and Elainediscussed The Book of the Law. She read it and, much to Crowley’s chagrin,believed it to be a prophetic book; he was hoping she would denounce it and thusrelieve him of the role of prophet, a burden that the book called for him toassume.Crowley asked her to help him invoke Aiwass and speak to him. She agreed, andtwo days later they conducted the ceremony. In what would become Crowley’spreferred method, he summoned Aiwass while Elaine looked for him on the astralplane. Aiwass appeared to her as brilliant blue with a wand in hand. “He hasfollowed you all along,” Elaine explained her impressions of him. “He wants youto follow his cult.” Crowley instructed her to take his wand. When she did,Aiwass turned into brilliant light and dissipated. “He seems to be tangled in amesh of light, trying to escape.”“Tell him that if he goes away, he cannot return,” Crowley instructed.“He has a message: ‘Return to Egypt, with same surroundings. There I will givethee signs. Go with the Scarlet Woman, this is essential; thus you shall getreal power, that of God, the only one worth having. Illumination shall come bymeans of power, pari passu … Live in Egypt as you did before. Do not do a GreatRetirement. Go at once to Egypt: money troubles will be settled more easily thanyou think now. I will give you no guarantee of my truth.’ Then he turnsblack-blue, and says, ‘I am loath to part from you. Do not take Fidelis. I donot like the relations between you; break them off! If not, you must followother Gods … Yet I would wish you to love physically, to make perfect the circleof your union. Fidelis will not do so, therefore she is useless.’ ”74[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts074]Satisfied with the ritual and the messages they received, they purified the areaand finished. Despite Aiwass’s suggestion that Elaine make love to Crowley, shelived up to her magical motto and remained faithful to her husband. On April 21,Crowley left Soror Fidelis and sailed for America on the Empress of India. Whilethey would remain in touch—in 1929, Crowley would note “My old and dear friendFidelis wants me to go to Frankfurt”75[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts075]—their bond would never be asstrong as during their alliance in the GD years.On April 24, while his ship docked at the Japanese port of Kobe, Crowleydutifully performed his invocation on the astral plane. This time, a visionappeared to him. In it, he entered a room in which a naked man was nailed to acruciform table. About this table sat a group of venerable sages, busily eatingthe flesh and drinking the blood of the naked man. A voice told Crowley thatthese sages were the adepts he would someday join. As the vision continued,Crowley entered a filigreed ivory hall, a square altar in the center its onlycontents. “What wouldst thou sacrifice upon the altar?” the voice asked.Crowley replied, “I offer all save my will to know Augoeides.” Knowledge andconversation of one’s holy guardian angel, after all, was the goal of all magic.At least as far as he knew. Looking about, Crowley realized he stood before theEgyptian gods, their forms so immense he could only see up to their knees.“Would not knowledge of the gods suffice?”Crowley was adamant. “No.”“Thou art critical and rationalistic.”The magician apologized for his blindness, kneeling at the altar and placingboth hands upon it, right over left. A luminous figure clad in white appearedbefore Crowley, placing his hands upon the magician’s, then spoke, “I receivethee into the Order of the Silver Star.”With that, Crowley returned to earth in a cradle of flame. The Secret Chiefs hadaccepted him as one of them, a member of the Third Order—those grades thatawaited beyond the highest ones in the GD; those reserved for the Secret Chiefs.He worried whether he was ready for the demands of the job. On April 30 he wrotein his journal:It has struck me—in connection with reading Blake—that Aiwass, etc. “Force andFire” is the very thing I lack. My “conscience” is really an obstacle and adelusion, being a survival of heredity and education. Certainly to rely on it asan abiding principle in itself is wrong. The one really important thing is thefundamental hypothesis: I am the Chosen One. All methods will do, if I onlyinvoke often and stick to it.76 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts076]No matter what else might happen, he had to prove himself by invoking often;otherwise, he would lose everything. Such was his understanding. What he didn’tknow at the time was that, if he did stick to it, he would have to loseeverything anyway.As he sailed, Crowley’s muse moved him again, and he wrote “The True GreaterRitual of the Pentagram” and worked on commentary to The Book of the Law. Thethought of returning to his wife and family also inspired him to compose “RosaCoeli,” the third in his cycle of poems to Rose.The Empress of India reached Vancouver, British Columbia, in twelve days; he hadjust missed the earthquake and fires that gutted San Francisco on April 18. FromVancouver, Crowley traveled east across the continent, passing through Calgary,Winnipeg, and Toronto. Across the border in the United States, Niagara Fallsimpressed him. On May 15 he reached New York City, fatigued by travel. After tendays of restaurants and theaters, he found no one willing to invest in aHimalayan climb and sailed for England on May 26.Arriving at Liverpool on June 2, Crowley picked up his mail, read the telegram,and his life fell apart.His daughter Lilith was dead."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENTHE GREAT WHITE BROTHERHOODStaring at the letters from his mother and Uncle Tom, Crowley was stunned.Lilith dead? Unbelievable, yet the facts were all there: she didn’t even livelong enough to reach London. Lilith Crowley had died of typhoid in Rangoon.Jewell, in one of his callous moments, remarked that Nuit Ma Ahathoor HecateSappho Jezebel Lilith Crowley actually died of acute nomenclature.Despite the heartache, Crowley struggled to recite the preliminary invocation,which he had sustained for the past four months. A sad robot, he reaffirmed hisoath to persevere no matter what, offering everything that remained of his life.He wandered the streets of London, emptily running through the words in hishead. June 7, on the train to Plymouth where Rose awaited, was the last time hewas able to complete the conjuration. When at last he saw his wife, they fellsobbing into each others’ arms. The couple stumbled around—nervous, weak, andweeping—for the next two days.In the midst of this misery, Crowley discovered that Rose had become analcoholic. Desperate for something on which to blame his misfortune, heconvinced himself that Lilith died because Rose, too drunk to properly sterilizea baby bottle, fed her with a contaminated nipple. But how could he blame hisRose of Heaven? The fault was not hers but the alcohol’s. And the alcoholism heblamed on her family. Tellingly, he never pointed the finger at himself forleaving his pregnant wife and infant to make their own way home from the FarEast while he returned in literally the opposite direction.Crowley’s health declined into a series of illnesses: after doctors removed aninfected gland from his groin, his right eye required a series of operations,all unsuccessful. Neuralgia and an ulcerated throat then set in and remainedwith him most of the year. Life’s miseries left him stunned and numb, sleepingmuch of the time.Then, like an angel come to put his life back on track, George Cecil Jones,Exempt Adept (7°=4°) of the Second Order, arrived on June 23 to discussCrowley’s work. They did so for the next two days, after which Jones advisedCrowley to go on a Great Magical Retirement, albeit close to home so he could bereached by telegraph if necessary. The visit eased some of Crowley’s sorrow, andhelped him concentrate again on the Great Work. On July 11, three days after heentered a nursing home for an operation, Crowley resumed daily recitation of theAugoeides invocation.Crowley left the nursing home on July 25 and, the day after, went to stay withJones. They continued to discuss and compare their magical experiences, and thefollowing day, Jones used a modified version of the GD’s Adeptus Minor (5°=6°)ritual to initiate Crowley: Bound upon the Cross of Suffering, AC once againspoke the words, “I, Perdurabo, a member of the Corpus Christi, do herebysolemnly obligate myself to lead a pure and unselfish life …” as he had donebefore Mathers in Paris six years ago. However, the ritual was more than mererepetition. It was a potent synthesis of their independent magical work, takingthe ceremony to undreamed levels and inspiring him like never before. Thus begana remarkable phase of Crowley’s work, two ex-GD members collaborating onmysteries their parent order scarcely imagined.On July 29 they started to think about founding a new magical order.John Frederick Charles Fuller (1878–1966) shared much with Crowley. He was theson of an Anglican cleric—Rev. Alfred Fuller (1832–1927), formerly the Rector ofItchenor1 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts001]—and, having a dreamyand introspective childhood, grew up later than most. He also attended Malvernand, like Crowley, learned to loathe it. In 1897, when Crowley began his thirdyear at Cambridge, Fuller’s parents sent their son to the Royal Military Collegeat Sandhurst. The college nearly turned the boy down because he was too skinny,but accepted him on probation on August 30. He graduated a year later and joinedthe 43rd Infantry.He spent the Boer War (1899) immersed in two hundred books on religion,philosophy, and other subjects and, while stationed in India in 1903, studiedHinduism, yoga, the Vedas, and the Upanishads. After reading Havelock Ellis’sStudies in the Psychology of Sex (1903) and E. N. Huston’s A Plea for Polygamy(1869), sexual freedom became one of his causes. Fuller believed that mankindneeded to tear off the “mystic fig leaf … and stand naked and sublime in all theglory and consummation of perfect Nature.”2[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts002] In 1905 he begged his mothernot to tell his father, the cleric, that he had just contributed the first ofwhat would be many articles to the Agnostic Journal;3[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts003] it was his first overtstatement of apostasy from the creed of his upbringing. The second was his essayon Crowley’s works, which he wrote during the hot summer of 1905. The Star inthe West (1907) would prove to be the first and only entry into Crowley’scontest for the best essay on his works. Throughout, it shamelessly praised thepoet: “It has taken 100,000,000 years to produce Aleister Crowley. The world hasindeed laboured, and has at last brought forth a man.”4[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts004] The praise, however, was notshallow. Fuller considered Crowley to be England’s greatest living poet, andbelieved it all his life.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_030_r1.jpg]John Frederick Charles Fuller (1878–1966), Frater Non Sine Fulmina. (photocredit 7.1) [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c07-fig001a]In October 1905, Fuller developed a record case of typhoid that lasted seventydays. On February 14, 1906, a medical board recommended an eight-month leave ofabsence. That April, he was discharged and sent home for a year’s sick leave. Hewrote to Crowley about these events, and AC responded with his first letter toFuller in nearly a year. Arriving August 8, 1906, it read:I am sorry to hear of your enteric fever, but fate has treated me even worse;for after a most successful trip through China without a day’s illness for anyof us, our baby girl died of that very disease on the way home.5[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts005]By mid-August they arranged their first face-to-face meeting at the Hotel Cecil.Under Crowley’s influence, his interest in the occult blossomed intofascination, and he plunged into its study. Likewise, Fuller’s knowledge ofHinduism impressed AC, spurring him on to study as well. Despite his daughter’sdeath, his pregnant wife’s alcoholism, and his own illness, Crowley devotedhimself to magic.At this point, not one but two individuals answering to the name “Lola” enteredCrowley’s life. The first was a nickname for Vera Snepp, whom Crowley,frustrated by Rose’s alcoholism, took as a mistress during visits with Jones inCoulsdon, Surrey. She acted under the name Vera Neville,6[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts006] and was one of the mostbeautiful English women he had ever met. AC chronicled their affair in poemswhich would later become part of Clouds without Water (1909):Lola! now look me straight between the eyes.Our fate is come upon us. Tell me nowLove still shall arbitrate our destinies,And joy inform the swart Plutonic brow.7[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts007]She would also become the dedicatee of Gargoyles (1906) and the model for theVirgin of the World in “The Wake World.”8[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts008]The other Lola appeared in September when Rose gave birth to Crowley’s seconddaughter, whom he named Lola Zaza, presumably after his mistress. The occasionwas hardly glad. The infant was sickly and, for her first three days of life, soinactive that they often feared she was dead. At three weeks of age, bronchitisnearly killed her. Given what modern medicine knows about the deleteriouseffects of maternal alcohol consumption on a fetus, frailty and low birth weightare unsurprising; but in the Edwardian age the Crowleys could only marvel attheir continued misfortune.With Rose and the baby recovering in Chiselhurst, Crowley returned to Coulsdonto study with Jones and recuperate from his own ailments. Under theseconditions, his health returned “suddenly and completely.” As with his health,Crowley also recovered his magical impetus. On September 21, he markedthirty-two weeks’ performance of Augoeides, with only a brief break during hiscrisis in June.The following day, Jones and Crowley celebrated the autumnal equinox. For theoccasion, Jones adapted the GD Neophyte (0°=0°) ritual, retaining andstreamlining its potencies while eschewing unnecessary details. The result was apowerful formula of initiation for their proposed mystic society. Into thetypical ceremony of testing and purifying a candidate they introduced spiraldancing and ritual scourging; and rather than binding the candidate to a crossas in the Adeptus Minor (5°=6°) ceremony, the candidate was pinned down and across cut on his chest. Jones asked Crowley to write the ceremony in verse form;the result was “Liber 671,” later dubbed “Liber Pyramidos.”9[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts009]After slight alterations by both magicians, they tested the revised ritual onOctober 9. Crowley considered the result among the greatest events of hiscareer: he attained the knowledge and conversation of his holy guardian angel.He experienced Shivadarshana, the vision of Shiva. He entered the trance ofsamadhi, union with godhead. After six years of false starts, he succeeded atthe Abramelin operation. In response, Crowley “thanked gods and sacrificed forLola”10 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts010]—his lover, not hischild.While his spiritual life soared with its victories, his personal life crumbledunder the stress of its burdens: Lilith’s death, Rose’s alcoholism, and LolaZaza’s frail grip on life. On November 4 he wrote in his diary, “Dog-faceddemons all day. Descent into Hell.” In magical terms, he had plumbed the depthsof the Ordeal of the Abyss, a magical rite of passage designed to obliterate themagician’s ego by destroying all he held dear: those physical attachments thatBuddha blamed for reincarnation; one’s selfishness, or sense of self. Themagical text “Liber Cheth” later described this spiritual desert:Then shall thy brain be dumb, and thy heart beat no more, and all thy life shallgo from thee; and thou shalt be cast out upon the midden, and the birds of theair shall feast upon thy flesh, and thy bones shall whiten in the sun.Then shall the winds gather themselves together, and bear thee up as it were alittle heap of dust in a sheet that hath four corners, and they shall give itunto the guardians of the Abyss.And because there is no life therein, the guardians of the abyss shall bid theangels of the winds pass by. And the angels shall lay thy dust in the City ofthe Pyramids …And behold! if by stealth thou keep unto thyself one thought of thine, thenshalt thou be cast out into the abyss for ever; and thou shalt be the lonelyone, the eater of dung, the afflicted in the Day of Be-with-Us.11[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts011]Mathers had never warned him about it, and he couldn’t have, because he neveradvanced this far along the spiritual path. But Crowley now realized the truth:only one who released everything was light enough to cross the desiccated yaw ofthe Abyss, to surpass the Second Order’s highest grade of Exempt Adept (7°=4°)and follow the path of the Secret Chiefs and their Great White Brotherhood. Bycontrast, those who clung to some vestige of their former lives were miredforever in the Abyss, doomed as one of the Black Brothers who elevated theiregos to the godhead. “I cannot even say that I crossed the Abyss deliberately,”Crowley wrote, illustrating that, although few ever advanced this far, theterrible ordeal was an eventuality for all magicians, a consequence of one’searliest oaths. “I was hurled into it by the momentum of the forces which I hadcalled up.”12 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts012]Thus Crowley surrendered all he valued, knowing that if he did not, the godswould wrench it from his feeble hands. When British Customs seized PhilippeRenouard’s shipment of AC’s latest (Alexandra), deemed it obscene, and destroyedall copies, it seemed like a test of his resolve.This illumination also recalled the warning written in the repugnant thirdchapter of The Book of the Law:Let the Scarlet Woman beware! If pity and compassion and tenderness visit herheart; if she leave my work to toy with old sweetnesses; then shall my vengeancebe known. I will slay me her child: I will alienate her heart: I will cast herout from men: as a shrinking and despised harlot shall she crawl through duskwet streets, and die cold and an-hungered.13[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts013]And he understood. The gods had killed Lilith because his attachment to her wasimpeding his progress in the Great Work. The gods killed her because Rose hadfailed in her role as Crowley’s magical partner. The gods killed her as awarning. In that moment, Crowley realized the cosmos played by very tough rules.On the eighth anniversary of his initiation into the GD—his spiritualbirthday—Crowley dedicated the epilogue of his collected Works to Jones, who hadacted as Kerux at his admission to that group:Eight years ago this day you, Hermes, led me blindfold to awake a chosen runnerof the course. “In all my wanderings in darkness your light shone before methough I knew it not.” To-day (one may almost hope, turning into the straight)you and I are alone. Terrible and joyous! We shall find companions at the End,at the banquet, lissome and cool and garlanded; companions with a Silver Star ormaybe a Jewelled Eye mobile and uncertain—as if alive—on their foreheads. Weshall be bidden to sit, and they will wreathe us with immortal flowers, and giveus to drink of the seemly wine of Iacchus—well! but until then, unless my heartdeceives me, no third shall appear to join us. Indeed, may two attain? It seemsa thing impossible in nature.…14[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts014]The Silver Star and Jeweled Eye in the triangle were symbols of the Third Order,theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg],the Great White Brotherhood of Secret Chiefs. Crowley considered himself andJones to be alone among the most advanced adepts in the world. However, lackinga third initiate to complete their founding triad (à laWestcott-Woodman-Mathers), they could not begin their new order.On December 10, Jones served as harbinger for the Secret Chiefs, who againinvited Crowley to join their ranks in the Third Order. No longer was he FraterOY MH, as he was known as an Exempt Adept (7°=4°), the seventh in the magicalhierarchy and fourth from the pinnacle. He had crossed the Abyss and hadadvanced to the eighth level, previously considered unattainable by corporealbeings. Or, as Jones put it, “OY MH is 8°=3°.”“And Mollie Lee rhymes with both,” he replied flippantly. Nevertheless, Jonesinsisted that, as 8°=3°, Crowley had not only attained the grade of Master ofthe Temple but had become the Master: the next Buddha, the logos, the prophet ofa new age. He thereupon performed a ritual to consecrate Crowley a Master of theTemple. Although Crowley still considered himself unfit for the honor, theritual made him feel like a genuine master.The next day—when Crowley went to Bournemouth and placed himself under adoctor’s care for throat trouble—he received a letter from Jones, reiteratingthe topic of their meeting:How long have you been in the Great Order, and why did I not know? Is theinvisibility of theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]to lower grades so complete?15 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts015]Crowley found his attainment increasingly difficult to deny.As he recuperated, he recalled his conversation with Allan Bennett about thevalue and necessity of the kabbalah as a universal language for magic. Crowleysat down on December 15 with the table of correspondences that Bennett had lefthim prior to his move to Ceylon and began to expand the entries. For the firstfour days, he devoted only eight hours to the project, but soon began to work onit in larger doses. On Christmas, for example, he spent all day and nightworking. Only a heated discussion between Crowley and Jones on the nature oftruth and magical attainment, as discussed in Crowley’s new essay “Amath”16[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts016] (Hebrew for “truth”), divertedhim. The completed work tabulated all the information taught by the GD, plus theknowledge Crowley had acquired in his trips to the world’s sacred sites; itwould be published as 777 in 1909.On January 29, 1907, Crowley left Bournemouth and returned home.Lola Zaza Crowley took a downturn on Friday, February 15. Since her first fraildays, she had developed respiratory complications that required a nurse to watchover her. She was on oxygen, and the doctor ordered that only one person bepermitted in the room with her at a time.Rose’s mother, Blanche Kelly, came in to visit the baby that Saturday. Crowleydisliked his mother-in-law, and when she broke the rules about Lola’s care, arow erupted. In the end, Crowley threw her out of the flat and, in his mind,saved the baby’s life. Alas, combined with Rose’s drinking and his own affair,the incident only contributed to marital discord.The evening started out like any other: Crowley walked down to Stafford Streetto his favorite haunt, chemist E. Whineray, who supplied unusual ingredients forhis ceremonial perfumes and incenses. Whineray’s bald head and largeeyes—shining alike with laughter and cynicism—reminded Crowley of an owl. “Heknew all the secrets of London. People of all ranks, from the courtier and thecabinet minister, to the coachman and the courtesan, made him their fatherconfessor,” Crowley wrote. “He understood human frailty in every detail and notonly forgave it, but loved men for their weaknesses.”17[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts017] Like Eckenstein, he could seethrough Crowley and understood him—a trait on which Crowley depended.Edward Whineray (1861–1924) was born in Ulverston, Lancashire, about a yearafter saddler William Whineray wed Betsy Hodgson.18[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts018] He became an apprentice of thePharmaceutical Society of Great Britain in 1875 and helped found the Chemists’Assistants’ Union in 1898, after which he became managing director atpharmaceutical chemists W. E. Lowe Co. Ltd. on 8 Stafford Street, building adistinguished clientele.19 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts019]Crowley claims that Whineray’s shop appears in novelist Robert Smythe Hichens’sFelix (1902), although Crowley fails to provide any details. In fact, Hichens’sunnamed fictional chemist on Wigmore Street discreetly dispenses morphine tosociety ladies, even in the dead of night.20[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts020] In his only review publishedin The Equinox, Whineray wrote of Chronicles of Pharmacy, “To the student of theoccult it ought to appeal strongly, as the author gives a long list of drugsused in religious ceremonies in different ages.”21[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts021]This day, Whineray had something new for him. The Right Honourable GeorgeMontagu Bennet (1852–1931), 7th Earl of Tankerville and Lord Ossulston, soughtan introduction.22 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts022] Athirteenth-generation descendent of princess of England Mary Tudor (1496–1533),Bennet was the second son of Charles Augustus Bennet (1810–1899) and Lady OliviaMontagu (1830–1922). He lived a colorful life, beginning as a Royal Navymidshipman in 1865, until severe sea-sickness compelled him to resign. Fromthere, he won the Ottley prize for drawing at Radley College, was a member ofthe Rifle Brigade from 1872, and aide-de-camp to the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland.His older brother Charles’s death in 1879 of cholera in Pahawur, India, left himheir to the peerage, so he assumed the title of Lord Bennet and left the army.Next, he went ranching in the western United States, where he was friendly withTeddy Roosevelt (1858–1919). In 1892 he met and befriended American Methodistgospel singer and evangelist Ira D. Sankey (1840–1908), accompanying him on manyrevivals and conducting some of his own.23[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts023] At one revival, he met LeonoraSophia van Marter, a music teacher of Tacoma, Washington, whom he married onOctober 23, 1895.24 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts024] Theearldom passed to Bennet upon his father’s death in late December 1899.25[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts025] Although one of the richestearldoms in England, with 31,500 acres of land and its chief seat ChillinghamCastle in Northumberland (famous for its herd of white wild cattle), it also hadthe highest rent. Consequently, Bennet was constantly in financial straits,residing in the family’s much more modest Thornington House in Northumberland.26[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts026] Known as “The Singing Earl,”he studied under Giovanni Sbriglia (1832–1916), was first president of theNewcastle Symphonium Society, sang at revivals, and participated in concertsuntil his death. He was also painted miniatures, some of which won awards27[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts027] and were hung in the RoyalAcademy.28 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts028]No sooner did Crowley agree to a meeting than Bennet entered from the next room.Taking Crowley aside, the Earl spoke to him like a lifelong friend, disclosingintimate details and discussing family secrets with embarrassing frankness. Butmost remarkable was his claim that his mother and her friend were trying to killhim with magic. He wanted Crowley to protect him. AC viewed him as sufferingfrom “persecution mania.” His predilections for “his old habit of brandytippling and his newly acquired one of sniffing a solution of cocaine” not onlyaccentuated his concerns—leading Crowley to nickname him the “Earl of Coke andCrankum”29 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts029]—but also explainedhis presence at Whineray’s shop.AC saw him as a religious man with a mystical bent, and although he doubted theaccuracy of his story, he knew Bennet himself believed it. Therefore, Crowleysuggested they take a retirement that spring so the master could teach himmagical self defense. The Earl of Tankerville delightedly agreed, and Crowleygained a new student.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_031_r1.jpg]George Montagu Bennet (1852–1931), 7th Earl of Tankerville. (photo credit 7.2)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c07-fig002a]The magicians were coming out of the woodwork: Jones and Fuller, now the Earl ofTankerville. Crowley pondered what could possibly happen next. Then he metVictor Neuburg.Victor Benjamin Neuburg (1883–1940) was a Jewish poet and native Londoner, bornin Islington to Bohemian merchant Carl Neuburg and his wife Jeannette (néeJacobs).30 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts030] Carl left thecountry shortly after Victor was born, so Jeanette moved in with her mother,Rebecca, where the Jacobs family helped raise Victor.31[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts031] His first published poem,“Vale Jehovah!,” appeared in the October 25, 1903, issue of the Freethinker,which encouraged him to continue publishing regularly, including in The AgnosticJournal.32 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts032] He was a youngmystic who believed in reincarnation, vegetarianism, and the existence of agreater reality. Thinking Judeo-Christian religions a sham and findingspiritualism unsatisfying, he was searching for a genuine master.When he met J. F. C. Fuller in 1906, Neuburg explained that he was studyingmedieval and modern languages at Trinity College. Fuller remarked on twocoincidences: first, he too was a regular contributor to the Agnostic Journaland had admired Neuburg’s writing. Second, his friend—poet and mystic AleisterCrowley—had also attended Trinity. Neuburg was very interested in meeting thisfriend, and Fuller happily supplied Crowley’s address. Thus he wrote andarranged a meeting.Crowley stepped into Neuburg’s room and introduced himself. Neuburg was a smallman, with a head much too large for his slight body. His lips, Crowley thought,were three times too thick for his face, and he later characterized Neuburg as a“sausage-lipped songster of Steyning.”33[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts033] Despite this, his brown hairand distinguished features made him handsome. Crowley explained that he had readNeuburg’s poetry and was very interested in it because it showed evidence ofastral projection. No reply was necessary: Crowley could tell just by looking athim that Neuburg had a terrific capacity for magic. Neuburg confirmed this bystating he had practiced spiritualism and clairvoyance. As the two got to knoweach other that weekend, they became entranced with each other: Crowley with theapprentice poet and magician, and Neuburg with the older master.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_032_r1.jpg]Victor Benjamin Neuburg (1883–1940). (photo credit 7.3)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c07-fig003a]Despite the dons’ objections, Neuburg invited Crowley to speak at Cambridge onThursday, February 28, 1907. This “First Missionary Mission,” as AC dubbed it,was one of many visits he would make to Neuburg’s poetry club, the Pan Society,to read poetry, discuss magic, and recruit students into his fold. Neuburg inturn devoted himself to the study of magic.A formative episode in Crowley’s work occurred when he wrote to Jones on March7, asking permission to take a vow of silence. Jones discouraged Crowley fromusing this fourth power of the Sphinx, and suggested an alternative: Crowleyought to vow to answer no questions for a week, punishing each violation of thisoath with a razor-cut on the forearm. Crowley picked up the gauntlet. On thefirst day of his oath, he slipped twenty-four times, but with an equal number ofgashes on his arm, he quickly learned. The next day, he slipped only twelvetimes, the total dwindling down to around seven for the following days. In all,he slipped seventy-two times in a week. The exercise taught Crowley an importantlesson in vigilance: not only did it make him carefully measure his words andresponses, but it raised his consciousness of the world around him. He was soimpressed that he incorporated the lesson into his cannon of magicalinstructions as “Liber Jugorum.”Rose, seeing her husband’s forearms covered with scabs and slices, hated theexercise. This friction further eroded their conjugal life and made him fearthat she was interfering with the Great Work. With precious little in common,and Rose’s drinking poisoning even that, Crowley moved into rooms on the fourthfloor of 60 Jermyn Street, London, on the weekend of March 23–24.Relieved to be alone, he worked to a peak at the end of May, when he took theoath of a Magister Templi (8°=3°) in the presence of “Tankerville.” In so doing,Crowley vowed to emerge from the Ordeal of the Abyss and stand in the entrancehall to the Third Order as a purely magical entity, selfless and unattached. Histask as a Master of the Temple was twofold: First, he had to found a temple(which was just the work he and Jones were doing). In addition, he vowed tointerpret every event in his life as a particular dealing of God with his soul.While any person could theoretically take this oath to find the significancebehind everything, the consequences for one unprepared for the grade of MagisterTempli were terrible indeed; at the very least, it swept an inexperienced soulinexorably toward the Abyss.The next day, Crowley and Tankerville arranged to take the magical retirementthey’d planned since their first meeting. It was the perfect opportunity forboth to study and learn. They planned to sail to Marseilles, Morocco, Mongolia,Gibraltar, and Spain, and began the voyage that June. Although Crowleyattributed Montagu’s claims of magical attack to paranoia, he taught him aprotection technique to alleviate his worries. As Crowley wrote:Whenever he noticed his mother flying past the moon on her broomstick, he wouldperform a banishing ritual, and sail out in his astral body onto the word andchop the broomstick like Sigfried with the lance of Wotan, and down she wouldfall into the Straits of Gibraltar, plop, plop.34[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts034]As they journeyed, Crowley also wrote many of the pieces that would appear inKonx Om Pax: “The Mask of Gilt” (July 12), “There is No Other God than He” (July13), “Return of Messalina” (July 22), and the piece considered by many to be hisbest poem, “La Gitana” (July 21). The last is about a Spanish gypsy who madeCrowley forget his domestic troubles:Your hair was full of roses in the dewfall as we danced,The sorceress enchanting and the paladin entranced,In the starlight as we wove us in a web of silk and steelImmemorial as the marble in the halls of Boabdil,In the pleasaunce of the roses with the fountains and the yewsWhere the snowy Sierra soothed us with the breezes and the dews!Crowley agreed with the critics, noting, “The Morocco poems seem to me about thebest I have ever done.”35 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts035]Before long, however, both men got on each other’s nerves. Crowley tired of theEarl’s incessant delusions, writing sarcastically in his journal for July 11, “Idon’t know about the Power of Samadhi; but I can tolerate Tankerville, and Iwant a new grade specially for that.” He summed up his feelings about Bennet in“The Suspicious Earl”:There was a poor bedevilled EarlWho saw a Witch in every girl,A Wehr-Wolf every time one smiled,A budding Vampire in a child,A Sorcerer in every man,A deep-laid Necromantic planIn every casual word; withalCloaked in its black horrific pallA Vehmgericht obscenely grim,And all designed—to ruin him!36[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts036]Meanwhile, the earl tired of the master’s constant lessons, telling Crowley,“I’m sick of your teaching, teaching, teaching as if you were God Almighty and Iwere a poor bloody shit in the street!” Shortly after they returned to Gibraltaron July 20, they had a row and parted. On July 25, they arrived in Southamptonaboard the Scharnhorst. 37 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts037]Throughout these adventures, Crowley continued to produce poetry. He had alreadycompleted in February the poems that made up Clouds without Water. Additional1907 releases from SPRT included Rosa Coeli, Rosa Inferni, and Rodin in Rime,all of which featured color lithographs of Rodin’s watercolors. The last bookwas a bold gesture on Crowley’s part because it was fashionable to criticizeRodin at this time; but Crowley chose to defend and praise him instead. SPRTalso reissued Tannhäuser and The Mother’s Tragedy.Finally, the winning essay on the works of Aleister Crowley appeared: The Starin the West, by J. F. C. Fuller, appeared as a prodigious, 328-page volume withwhite buckram covers gilt-stamped with Crowley’s Magister Templi (8°=3°) emblem,or lamen. A vesica enclosed the lamen, which consisted of a crown with a sword’sblade extending through and far above it, balancing on its tip a scale whosepans held the Greek letters alpha and omega; it also sported five V’s, whichrepresented Crowley’s Magister Templi motto, Vi Veri Vniversum Vivus Vici (“Bythe power of truth, I have conquered the universe”). Although Crowley and Fullerreleased only one hundred copies of this signed and numbered edition,38[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts038] it was significant in markingthe appearance of Frater V.V.V.V.V., the Magister Templi.Although Crowley professed not to accept this grade until 1909, he clearlyclaimed it much sooner: on May 30, 1907, five months after Jones declared him8°=3°, he took his 8°=3° oath with Montagu as a witness; he published The Starin the West with his Magister Templi lamen on the cover; and his diary from thisperiod contains many references to the attainment, such as “I think this stampsme clearly as an 8°=3° elect.”39[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts039] After returning to London fromhis trip with Montagu, Crowley mailed out cards which bore the lamen ofV.V.V.V.V.; this mailing puzzled at least one recipient, who wrote to the DailyMirror:[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_033_r1.jpg]Contemporary cartoon about Crowley’s Magister Templi lamen. (photo credit 7.4)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c07-fig004a]Two days ago I received the enclosed card anonymously, and just glancing at itbriefly, thinking it an advertisement of some sort, I placed it on themantlepiece.Within a few minutes, disasters of a minor kind began to happen in my littlehome.First, one of my most valuable vases fell to the ground and was smashed topieces. My little clock stopped—the clock was near the card—and then Idiscovered to my amazement that my dear little canary lay dead at the bottom ofits cage!40 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts040]Although the letter is unsigned, Crowley is likely the author.Alas, The Star in the West turned out to be the name of a children’s bookpublished in London the previous year.41[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts041] This mix-up caused a chagrinedFuller to publish an apologia that summer in the Athenaeum:I exceedingly regret that through an unfortunate coincidence my recentlypublished volume The Star in the West, a critical essay upon the writings ofAleister Crowley, bears the same title as a Welsh story for children by MissMary Debenham, already published by the National Society. But for the fact thatmy work was already printed and bound before my attention was drawn to thispoint, I would willingly have changed the title. However, with the courteousconsent of both publishers, the title is retained; and I trust this letter willsave booksellers any inconvenience that might have arisen from this similarityof the titles.42 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts042]Unlike Crowley’s postcard, no mishaps were reported with Fuller’s book.By this time, Crowley was living in London at Coram Street, and new workscontinued to flow from his busy pen: he followed his poetic adaptation of Poe’s“The Tell-Tale Heart” and hymns to the Virgin Mary with “The Hermit,” and“Empty-headed Athenians.” Next, he worked on Konx Om Pax, writing its prologueand dedication and designing its cover. That fall, Crowley wrote the novella“Ercildoune” and the short story “The Wizard Way.”43[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts043]Volume three of his collected Works was also in press at the time. Although TheBook of the Law had been typeset and slated to appear as an appendix with abrief commentary,44 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts044] Crowleyscrapped the plan. Instead, the appendix became a bibliography of Crowley’spublished works up through 1906, compiled by Duncombe-Jewell. Despiteintentional omissions—notably, White Stains and Snowdrops from a Curate’sGarden—the bibliography was excellent and progressive;45[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts045] information on print runs,paper type, and binding clarified to all how fine and collectible Crowley’sfirst editions were.Familial tension finally erupted at the end of October, when Crowley received agrocer’s bill for the 120 bottles of liquor that Rose had purchased over thepast five months. Pondering where the devil Rose could have stashed a bottle ofliquor a day, Crowley searched the house but found no trace of alcohol anywhere.He had to assume she drank it all. Armed with the evidence he needed, Crowleyconfronted his wife with the facts. She admitted to drinking heavily, andCrowley sent her to Leicester to dry out for two months.When he first read Sri Brahma Dhàra (“Shower from the Highest”) by yogi MahatmaSri Agamya Guru Paramahamsa (born c. 1841),46[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts046] Crowley had heard that thefierce author was nicknamed the Tiger Mahatma and that he referred to seekerswho were too meek for his tastes as “sheep.” A retired judge, he devoted himselfto religion and was described by German philologist and orientalist Max Müller(1823–1900) as the only Indian saint he had ever known. His temper was bothfierce and legendary, which seemed to attract—and ultimately repel—hisfollowers.47 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts047] Back on November13, when the guru was on his second trip to London, Crowley had sent him acryptic letter. “If you are the one I seek,” the note read, “this will suffice.”He had enclosed his name and address and awaited a reply. A response had comethe next day, and several days later Crowley had begun meeting the guru forinstructions on yoga.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_034_r1.jpg]The “Tiger Mahatma,” Sri Agamya Guru Paramahamsa. (photo credit 7.5)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c07-fig005a]That was last fall. Now that Agamya had returned to London, Crowley rejoined himand his “tiger cubs” at 60 South Audley. Before long, however, Crowley andAgamya had “a devil of a row”48[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts048] at a meeting of students. Inresponse, AC asked Fuller—who, he knew, was well versed in both yoga andAgamya’s writings (of which he thought little)—to attend a meeting the followingSunday. Fuller went, and his disdain for the proceedings was evident. Afterninety minutes’ talk, the yogi grew upset with Fuller, crying out, “Youpig-faced man! You dirty fellow, you come here to take away mydisciples … Crowley send this pig-one, eh?” At that, Fuller politely took hishat and cane and walked to the door. Before closing it behind himself, Fullerpoked his head back in and, in Hindi, replied, “Shut up, you son of a sow!”49[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts049] Fuller could hear the yogi’scharacteristic fit of anger as he closed the door and walked away.Agamya’s concerns may have been well-founded. Crowley, trying to found an orderwith Jones, sought students, and the same purposefulness that caused Tankervilleto exclaim “I’m sick of your teaching, teaching, teaching” may have made Agamyauneasy: the Tiger Mahatma’s claim that AC took away his students may reflecteither a concern or the truth.Crowley’s results with magic began to resemble those he obtained in Cairo in1904. Crossing the Abyss required that he release everything dear to him: hiswife, daughter, and that one item for which he had fought so hard—his holyguardian angel. The lesson, he learned, was not to lose these things but to beable to release them and act without attachment; for, that fall, Crowleyrealized his holy guardian angel was still with him. “I can, I know, get intotouch with Adonai at will,” he recorded in his diary.50[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts050] Adonai was the Hebrew word for“lord,” and was used as a title of the holy guardian angel.On October 30, Crowley got it in writing. That evening, the automatic writing“Liber VII” was penned, the first of a series of “Holy Books” that Crowleyclaimed were dictated by his holy guardian angel, Aiwass. In one sitting of twoand a half hours, Crowley took down its seven chapters, one for each of thetraditional astrological planets; although longer than The Book of the Law, ittook thirty fewer minutes to write. “Liber VII,” Crowley explained, was anaccount of “the voluntary emancipation of a certain Exempt Adept from hisAdeptship. These are the birth-words of a Master of the Temple.”51[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts051]Immediately after finishing VII, he began another. Throughout this writing,Crowley basked in the trance of samadhi, his own identity dissolved into thecosmic dance, recording passively the dictation of his inner voice.52[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts052] These writings continuedintermittently until November 3, when he finished “Liber Cordis CinctiSerpente,” or “The Book of the Heart Girt about by the Serpent,” the longest ofthe Thelemic Holy Books. Each of its five chapters (one for each element)contains sixty-five verses describing the relationship of an Adeptus Minor(5°=6°) with his holy guardian angel.Ever since Kangchenjunga, Crowley and Jones met regularly to discuss, compareand practice magic. They knew they held the key to a newer and more potentformula of initiation than that of old, and this led Crowley to write:O restless rats that gnaw the bonesOf Aristophanes and Paul!Come up to me and Mr. JonesAnd see the rapture of it all!53[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts053]For the past year, however, their lack of a third member to form a governingtriad had stalled their formation of a magical order.On November 15, Crowley visited Jones with a solution: his bright friend, FraterPer Ardua ad Astra (“To the stars through great effort”), also known as FraterNon Sine Fulmine (“Not without thunder”), known among mundane men as Captain J.F. C. Fuller, would be the third. Jones considered the proposition and consentedto forming the triad.TheA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg],commonly known as the Argenteum Astrum or Silver Star, successor to the GD, wasborn.Through the remainder of that year, automatic writings continued to pour fromCrowley’s pen. On November 25 he wrote “Liber LXVI,” or “Stellae Rubae.” Itscontents are cryptically described as “a secret ritual of Apep, the Heart ofIAO-OAI, delivered unto V.V.V.V.V. for his use in a certain matter of LiberLegis.”54 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts054] The veiled passagesof this writing become clear when they are understood to describe a sexualritual with his current mistress, a golden-haired, green-eyed woman by the nameof Ada Leverson. Her name appears as an acronym of the first two lines:Apep deifieth Asar.Let excellent virgins evoke rejoicing, son of Night! …There shall be a fair altar in the midst, extended upon a black stone. At thehead of the altar gold, and twin images in green of the Master. In the midst acup of green wine. At the foot the Star of Ruby. The altar shall be entirelybare.And so on. She is alo “the gilded lily with geranium lips” in Crowley’s shortstory, “Illusion d’Amoureux,” which opens with the description:Kindlier than the moon, her body glowed with more than harvest gold. Fierierthan the portent of a double Venus, her green eyes shot forth utmost flames.From the golden chalice of love arose a perfume terrible and beautiful, aperfume strong and deadly to overcome the subtler fragrance of her whole beingwith its dominant, unshamed appeal.55[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts055]Ada Esther Leverson, née Beddington (1862–1933), a dozen and one years olderthan Crowley, was an attractive author whose first novel, The Twelfth Hour,Grant Richards had published that year (1907). Although she had known all theimportant literary people since the 1880s, she made no attempt to write untilOscar Wilde—who dubbed her “The Sphinx” for her “strange, enigmaticexpression”—suggested in 1892 that she contribute to the magazines Black andWhite and Punch. She did and by 1903 had a regular column, “White and Gold,” inthe Referee. She had married young and hastily—at age nineteen, she marriedErnest David Leverson (c. 1851–1921), an East Indian merchant eleven years hersenior, at Marylebone.56 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts056] Shehad a daughter, Violet, around 1890, but nevertheless found marriagedissatisfying.57 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts057] Findingdivorce too scandalous, she simply split with her husband and carried on affairswith William Ulick O’Connor Cuffe the fourth Earl of Desart, Prince Henrid’Orléans, and George Moore. “To marry at Hastings would be to repent at St.Leonard’s,” she often joked, and Crowley had to agree with another of Wilde’scharacterizations: she was the wittiest person he had ever met.58[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts058] Reviewing her works, Crowleycalled her “easily the daintiest and wittiest of our younger femininewriters.”59 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts059] However, neitherleft much record of the affair; it appears to have been a brief and convenienttryst for them both.60 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts060] Crowleyfollowed Wilde in carrying on her nickname, dedicating to her the sensuous poem“The Sphinx” in The Winged Beetle (1910).[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_035_r1.jpg]Ada Leverson (1862–1933). (photo credit 7.6)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c07-fig006a]On December 3, Crowley scribbled down a series of sigils representing the geniiof the twenty-two paths of the reverse side of the Tree of Life—the World ofShells known as the Qlippoth—and the genii of the twenty-two paths of thekabbalah, corresponding to the twenty-two major cards of the tarot. Thiscontinued to December 5 and 6, when he received twenty-two verses describing“the cosmic process so far as it is indicated by the Tarot Trumps.”61[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts061] He also received the names ofthe genii whose sigils he recorded several days previously. This constituted“Liber Arcanorum,” one of the more puzzling and inaccessible of the Holy Books,which, some believe, holds the key to a grimoire of magic dealing with thereverse side of the Tree of Life.On December 8, Crowley took a break from being Aiwass’s scribe and returned toCambridge despite official protestations. This time he met Norman Mudd(1889–1934) of Manchester, the bright son of a poor certified schoolmaster,William Dale Mudd (b. 1861) and his wife Emma (born c. 1860).62[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts062]Born in Prestwich, Lancashire, Norman was the middle of three children, hisother siblings being older sister Nellie (b. 1887) and younger sister Era (bornc. 1894).63 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts063] Norman attendedDucie Avenue Schools,64 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts064] earneda mathematics scholarship to Cambridge, and had just entered Trinity that July.Physically short and unattractive, he introduced himself with his meek trademarkstatement, “You won’t remember me. My name’s Mudd.” His intellect, however, wasas virile as any: a Freethinker, he was a friend of Neuburg’s and belonged tohis Pan Society. He and Crowley spent hours talking. As Mudd recalled, “I thenunderstood for the first time what life was or might be; and the spark of thatunderstanding has been in me ever since, apparently unquenchable, alwaysworking.”65 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts065] Captivated by themagician, Mudd felt that magic was the only thing he had encountered that gavehis life any meaning or value, and he gladly agreed to distribute Crowley’sbooks on campus.The automatic writing “Liber Porta Lucis, Sub Figura X” (“The Book of the Gateof Light”) followed on December 11 and 12. Its brief text described how theMasters sent forth Frater V.V.V.V.V. as their messenger, giving their messageand exhorting men to take up the Great Work. In short, it was an invitation totheA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg].The number of this book, ten, was that of Malkuth, the sphere on the Tree ofLife where the initiate symbolically begins.“Liber Tau” followed the next day. The book divided the Hebrew alphabet intoseven triads that represented “ideas relating respectively to the Three Orderscomprised in theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg].”66[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts066] Its number, four hundred, isthat of the Hebrew letter Tau, under which the remaining twenty-one letters aresubsumed.Later that day, he penned “Liber Trigrammaton” (XXVII). This book synthesizedthe Chinese duality of yin-yang (represented by the solid and broken lines ofthe I Ching) with the Tao (represented in this system by a dot). The result wastwenty-seven trigrams and their corresponding text. Crowley equated this bookwith the Stanzas of Dzyan, upon which The Secret Doctrine, the cornerstone ofBlavatsky’s Theosophical movement, was a comment.Finally that winter, Crowley received “Liber DCCCXIII vel Ararita.” Its sevenchapters described “a very secret process of initiation”67[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts067] whereby any idea is reduced tounity by synthesis, then drawn beyond by the method itself.The significance of these texts—from Stellae Rubae to Ararita—is that Crowleywould ultimately place them in the same category as The Book of the Law:immutable revealed texts transmitted through him by a higher intelligence.Crowley would eventually devote time to explaining the contents of some of thesebooks;68 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts068] however, the meaningof others remains unclear to this day. Regardless, they represented an importantspiritual advancement. On December 15, he wrote in his diary, “not since myattainment in October has there been any falling away whatever. I am able to doautomatic writing at will … I cannot doubt that I am an 8°=3° … At last I’ve gotto a stage where desire has utterly failed; I want nothing.”The time to advertise theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]came at the beginning of 1908. To this end, Crowley commissioned Walter Scott toprint five hundred copies of Konx Om Pax for SPRT. The book was one of Crowley’smore enigmatic offerings, ranking up there with The Sword of Song for itsstupefication value. Its title derived from a phrase used in Greek mysteryreligions; heated debate has long surrounded its meaning, but the GD equated itwith the Egyptian Khabs Am Pekht, “light in extension.” Illumination. Hence,Crowley subtitled the book “Essays in Light.” Adding even more mystery, theblack cover sported a curious design that careful investigation revealed was thetitle, stretched long and thin across the entire front cover so that it wasnearly illegible. The book opened with quotes—in their original languages—fromvarious religious and philosophical sources, including the Qur’an, Gnostictexts, Tao Teh King (Tao Te Ching), and the Stele of Ankh-f-n-Khonsu. Thededication left no doubt that Crowley was writing for a mystical society:To all and every person in the whole world who is without the Pale of the Order;and even to Initiates who are not in possession of the Password for the timebeing …69 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts069]The text itself was a mixed bag of essays: “The Wake World” was an allegoricalaccount of initiation, using the symbolism of kabbalah and the tarot. The skit“Ali Sloper, or the 40 Liars” parodied several GD members, himself, and ayuletide argument between Bowley and Bones (Crowley and Jones) on the nature oftruth. The philosophical essay “Thien Tao” followed, and “The Stone of thePhilosophers,” a collection of poems written during his association withTankerville, concluded the volume.Although the book is truly clever and witty, it bombed like a joke that neededexplaining. The Scotsman considered it “more tolerable in its verse than itsprose, for a poet is not expected to be sensible.” Ironically, a reviewer forJohn Bull—which would make Crowley’s destruction its personal crusade only threeyears later—was among the few to see its humor: “I was moved to so much laughterthat I barely escaped a convulsion.”70[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts070] Perhaps the most criticalreview came from Mathers, who, objecting to its description of him as a thief,sicced his solicitors, Messrs. Nussey and Fellowes, on the author. Crowleyreplied simply, “I care as little for your threats of legal action as for yourclient’s threats of assassination … I am surprised that a firm of your standingshould consent to act for a scoundrel.”71[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c07-nts071]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTSINGER OF STRANGE AND OBSCENE GODSIn February, 1908, Rose completed two months of treatment for alcoholism. TheCrowleys marked the occasion with a visit to Eastbourne, where he had setrecords thirteen years ago for scaling Beachy Head. Just as climbing had broughtyoung Alec from the brink of death as a youngster, they now went on some easyclimbs for Rose’s health. She seemed happy and cured of her drinking. During thevisit, Crowley took five days to write The World’s Tragedy, his autobiographicalindictment of Victorian England. In terms of imagination, expression, and meter,Crowley ranked it among his best works. Both his wife and his muse had returned.After a fortnight of vacationing, the Crowleys moved into a new residence at 21Warwick Road. It was let in Rose’s name, because Crowley, finding his fortunedwindling, feared he might not be able to assume responsibility for the rent.Within days of the move, Rose began drinking more than ever. Alcohol made herirritable, and the couple constantly bickered. Powerless to stop her yet unableto watch her abuse herself, Crowley went to stay with Monsieur and MadameBourcier at the Hotel de Bois, 50 rue Vavin, Paris. It was a popular destinationfor expatriate writers and artists through the 1920s and 1930s, such as Americanjournalist and anarchist Louise Bryant, British novelist Ford Maddox Ford,American critic and essayist Harold Edmund Stearns, Czech-American artist JanMatulka, and Budapest photojournalist Robert Capa;1[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts001] American diplomat Howard R.Simpson had lived there while an art student, and recalled it as a hôtel depasse, or house of prostitution.2[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts002] Disillusioned by theunfulfilled promise of his wife’s recovery, Crowley would have stayed in Parisindefinitely, had not his father-in-law, Reverend Kelly, written a few weekslater that the coast was clear. Rose’s family and friends had pressured her intomoderation.He returned to London and resumed business as usual, looking up Alfred RichardOrage (1873-1934), publisher of The New Age magazine and secretary of theSociety for Psychical Research. They had first met two years ago at theSociety’s meetings, where Crowley reportedly asked him, “By the way, what numberare you?” Orage, unsure what the hell he meant, gave the first number thatpopped into his head: twelve. Crowley’s eyes had widened in response. “Good God,are you really? I’m only seven.”3[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts003] Since that peculiarintroduction, Crowley became “Orage’s intimate friend.”4[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts004] The New Age reviewed both TheStar in the West and Konx Om Pax, and ran his poem “The Pentagram.”5[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts005] Likewise, at the presentmeeting with Orage, Crowley arranged to publish “The Suffragette: A Farce” inthe May 30 issue. The piece appeared under the pseudonym Lavinia King, a nameCrowley would later use as a character in Moonchild (1929).6[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts006] He intended to contributemore, but Orage’s lover, Beatrice Hastings, claims she blocked Crowley fromfilling the journal’s pages with what she considered his “turgid out-pourings.”7[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts007]Crowley also met with Irish author and journalist Frank Harris (1856–1931),currently editor of London’s Vanity Fair magazine. Harris was well known in histime for his irascible personality and friendships with the famous, and he isremembered for his many sexual exploits, detailed in his multivolume (and at onetime banned) memoirs, My Life and Loves (1922).8[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts008] Over the next year, Crowleywould publish many of his cosmopolitan exploits in this magazine, ranging fromserialized pieces such as “The Expedition to Chogo Ri” and “On a Burmese River”to short articles like “With a Madman on the Alps.”9[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts009]Although London offered business, it could not return his wife. True, no one hadseen Rose drinking. But Crowley knew something was wrong, and soon discoveredshe was sneaking drinks when she thought nobody was watching. Moreover, in herdrunken rages, she locked him out of the house, insulted his guests, andgenerally became hysterical.10 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts010]Sad and disappointed, he sent her back to the doctor. “I wonder why you didn’tput your foot down a year ago,” was all his brother-in-law Gerald could say whenhe visited at the end of April.Gerald was right. His gesture was too little too late. Rose’s drinking hadexacerbated so much that her doctor visits were futile. Crowley packed his bagsand told her, “When you fall down the stairs in a drunken stupor and killyourself, I don’t want anyone to say I hit you with a crowbar. I cannot live inthe same house with a dipsomaniac, and I shall not return until you are cured.”Given her past relapses, Crowley held out little hope for recovery. On May 23,he wrote to Fuller, perhaps a little too eagerly:I don’t think we should shut our eyes to the fact that I am now a bachelor toall intents and purposes; and what is better, one in the glorious andunassailable position of not being able to marry if I want to!11[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts011]Thus, he returned to Paris to look up some friends and take model Nina Olivier—adedicatee in The Star and the Garter, “The Ordeal of Ida Pendragon,” and Rodinin Rime—as a lover.He also met artist’s model Euphemia Lamb (c. 1889–1957), of Greenheys,Manchester. Born Nina Forrest, she was nicknamed Euphemia by artist Henry Lamb(1883-1960), who would later become an established war artist and portraitpainter. She met him in 1905, married him in 1906 after becoming pregnant, andmoved with him to Paris in 1907, where she sat for artists like Augustus John,James Dickson Innes, Ambrose McEvoy, and Edward Gore. Her best-known likeness isa Jacob Epstein bust, which he completed in 1908.12[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts012] Euphemia had many liaisons inboth England and France, leading Vanessa Stephen to observe how “interestingimpure women are to the pure.… I see her as someone in mid ocean, struggling,diving, while I pace my bank.”13[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts013] This resulted in a jealous andtempestuous marriage, and when she met Crowley, she had recently separated fromher husband. “A virgin always does the wrong thing at the right time,” she toldAC,14 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts014] and became his lover.“She was incomparably beautiful,” Crowley wrote, “capable of stimulating thegreatest extravagances of passion.”15[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts015] Happy, witty, and bright, shecould have become Crowley’s grande passion, but he wasn’t looking for anythingso complicated as a relationship. Crowley wrote “After Judgement” forher—dedicating it, none too obliquely, to “Ophelia L.”—and declared it one ofthe most passionate poems in the English language. “Telepathy” he dedicated evenmore overtly to “Euphemia L.” Other poems in her honor included “The Wings,”“The Eyes of Dorothy,” “The Silence of Columbine,” and “Belladonna,” all bearingthe discrete dedication to “Dot” or “Dot L.” All of these would appear in TheWinged Beetle (1910).Victor Neuburg soon joined them in Paris to continue his magical training. Atthis time, Crowley learned that Neuburg was a gifted materializing medium, whichis to say he had an uncanny ability to cause the spirits that they evoked totake on a definite, visible form. While Neuburg lacked the discipline to do italone, he experienced spectacular results with Crowley’s help. In one incident,a figure appeared in a locked room with them for nearly an hour, vanishing onlywhen the magicians became exhausted. This ability made him an ideal partner:whereas Crowley previously relied upon faith or, at best, a form half-visiblethrough clouds of Dittany of Crete, there was no doubt with Neuburg: entitiesappeared visibly at his bidding.On July 31, they left Paris for Bordeaux, thus beginning a walking trip throughSpain. In a letter to Fuller, Crowley wrote, “We’ve done 140 miles of hot, dustymountain-road in a week, which isn’t bad.”16[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts016] It was on this trip thatCrowley analyzed his drug experiences in “The Psychology of Hashish.”17[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts017]While swimming at a Spanish waterfall, Crowley noticed Victor had a varicoceleand sent him to a physician. The result, Crowley reported, cured his sexualneurosis and unleashed his poetic talent. It seems strange that Crowley couldnotice a varicose vein on Neuburg’s penis. Indeed, this incident may point tothe beginning of their homosexual relationship. Edward Carpenter’s (1844–1929)controversial book The Intermediate Sex18[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts018]—which influenced Neuburg’sopinions toward sexuality—appeared at this time. Carpenter was a lecturer,pacifist, political activist, and advocate of sexual freedom; The IntermediateSex argued that homosexuality was biologically determined and, therefore, not asin. Neuburg’s poetry from this period depicts his struggle with both magic andsin as he and his mentor trekked through the Spanish countryside:Sweet wizard, in whose footsteps I have trodUnto the shrine of the most obscene god …Let me once more feel thy strong hand to beMaking the magic signs upon me! Stand,Stand in the light, and let mine eyes drink inThe glorious vision of the death of sin.19[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts019]On August 28, 1908, they abandoned the idea of walking to Gibraltar, continuinginstead to Granada and Rondon, where they caught a boat to Gibraltar. OnSeptember 13, Neuburg left to visit his relatives. At a loss, Crowley wrote hismarvelous essay on questions and assertions, “The Soldier and the Hunchback ! &?”20 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts020]Two days later, he sailed back to London and checked Rose’s progress. Herdrinking, he discovered, was worse than ever, so he returned to Paris, takingtheir daughter, Lola, with him. At best, the act might induce Rose to complywith her treatment; at the very least, it would keep the child out of harm’sway.On October 1, Crowley began a magical retirement dubbed “John St. John,”21[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts021] whereby he hoped todemonstrate how any person could conduct a magical retirement for a fortnightwhile still living a mundane work a day life. Each day, he practiced hatha yogaand his rewritten, solitary version of “Liber Pyramidos” in order to demonstratehow any person could attain to the knowledge and conversation of their holyguardian angel.The same evening he began his retirement, Nina Olivier introduced Crowley toParisian model Mary Waska, whom he described as a redheaded bundle of mischief.He bought her dinner, then brought her to his room to make love. Naked, shereminded Crowley of Corregio’s (1489?–1534) portrayal of Antiope.22[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts022] Under this inspiration, hepenned “The Two Secrets,” which would later appear in The Winged Beetle (1910).In November, Crowley purchased Maugham’s newest novel, The Magician. It was thestory of blubbery, debased magician Oliver Haddo and his victimization of aninnocent couple. As he read, something about the book struck him as vaguelyfamiliar. Then it dawned on him that many of Haddo’s words were his own, utteredin conversations with Maugham at Le Chat Blanc. In fact, Haddo’s entirecharacter was modeled on him. Crowley was flattered.Nevertheless, something else about the book seemed familiar. On closerinspection, it appeared that Maugham had inserted long unacknowledged quotesfrom magical texts that Crowley had recommended to him. As he read, Crowleyrecognized passages lifted wholesale from Mathers’s The Kabbalah Unveiled(1887), Franz Hartmann’s The Life and Doctrines of Paracelsus (1891), and A. E.Waite’s translation of Éliphas Lévi’s Rituel et Dogme de la Haute Magie (1896).He also noted portions that paralleled books by Mabel Collins and H. G. Wells.Crowley wrote up an exposé and submitted it to Vanity Fair. Editor Frank Harriswas incredulous until Crowley brought a stack of books into his office andproved his point. However, the piece was too long to use in its full form, so anedited version appeared in the December 30, 1908, issue as “How to Write aNovel! After W.S. Maugham.”23 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts023]As a final ironic twist, Crowley published it under the pseudonym Oliver Haddo.When Crowley and Maugham met a few weeks after the article appeared, Maugham wasgood-humored about it all. He laughingly admitted that his book contained evenmore unacknowledged quotes than the article mentioned. Crowley replied, “Harriscut my article by two-thirds for lack of space. You know, I almost wish that youwere an important writer.” Crowley’s statement is tinged with jealousy, sinceMaugham, after ten years of failure as a playwright, now had four plays runningin London’s West End and was the talk of the town. Crowley’s own works,meanwhile, remained unsuccessful: book sales were slow, and he had releasednothing since Konx Om Pax at the beginning of the year.That changed around New Year’s Day, when his next book, a collection ofdevotional poems to the Virgin Mary, appeared. The title came from the“password” Crowley had chosen randomly at the autumnal equinox of 1907 when thebook was written: Amphora. The book was anonymous, “Privately printed for theAuthoress and her intimates” by the Arden Press. Its epilogue contained one ofCrowley’s classic acrostics:Transcend, O Mage, thy soul redeemed!Her mercy shone where sorrow steamed.Exalted in the skies of evenVirtue hath cleared thy way to Heaven.In darkness hides the glittering ore.Revealed thy Light, O mystic loreGiven by God, lest I should errIn dexter or in sinister.Now Mary Virgin to my speechMarried Her fire that all and eachAt last should gather to the TrystRipe suns arisen above the mist!Yea! Thou hast given me favour! Yea!In utmost love and awe we pray;Devoted to Thy reverenceEnkindle I the sweet incense.Secure from all the fears that chillIn peace from them that rage and kill;Receive, O Queen, the glad OrationEven from a lost and pagan nation.But Thou will make us wholly fitUnto Thy grace and care of it.Till all the Elixir do receive(Amen) to heal the hurt of Eve.Reading the first letter of the first word of each line then the first letter ofthe last word of each line reveals a phrase certain to thrill schoolboys andshock pontiffs: “The Virgin Mary I desire, but arseholes set my prick on fire.”A simpler acrostic appears in the initial letters of the prologue:Those Pagans gazing on the Heavenly HostWere blest of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost;And me, though I be as an heathen mage,Thou wilt accept in this my pious page.Both hidden messages went unnoticed by readers, and it is just as well, asCrowley’s intent was not to blaspheme. The book originated with the realizationthat several of his poems in praise of non-Christian goddesses (and, often,gods) became perfectly acceptable hymns by merely changing the name to Mary andperhaps changing a key word or two. He thought this significant, and set aboutto write a set of hymns to the Virgin Mary from the mind set of a piousChristian. As Crowley explained, “I do not see why I should be confined to onelife. How can one hope to understand the world if one persists in regarding itfrom the conning tower of one’s own personality?”24[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts024] The acrostics were merely asign not to take the work too seriously.When Catholic circles responded enthusiastically to the book, Crowley removedthe epilogue and submitted it to the firm of Burns & Oates for republication.Crowley did nothing to dispel rumors that its author was a leading Londonactress. Some time later, Wilfrid Meynell (1852–1948), who ran the company,discovered who the “authoress” really was. In response, his wife passed out, andhe pulled the book, returning the unsold sheets to Crowley.The New Age, reviewing Crowley’s reissue of the book two years later under thetitle Hail Mary, found the poems “all marked by that facility and freedom ofdiction and metrical fluency that are such striking features of the author’sprofaner works,” but concluded, “Personally, I find Mr. Crowley the devotee ofMary considerably less interesting and much less amusing than Mr. Crowley thesinger of strange and obscene gods, Abracadabras, and things one doesn’tmention.”25 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts025]The doctors gave up on Rose at the beginning of 1909. She was uncooperative withher regimen, refusing to stop drinking, and her only hope wasinstitutionalization for two years. Only then could doctors control and monitorher behavior. Rose refused.Hearing this news, Crowley too gave up. He claimed he still loved her, but couldno longer bear to watch her kill herself. He demanded a divorce. So that theproceedings would not reflect poorly on her, Crowley agreed for Rose to divorcehim for infidelity. Although Crowley says he manufactured the necessaryevidence, he didn’t have to look too far, given his recent trysts. Despite thiswrinkle, Rose and Aleister still lived together and saw each other daily.His friendship with Gerald Kelly, however, became strained, and they eventuallyparted. Gerald’s bitterness would never fade; when Crowley called on him in the1930s, an immediate altercation broke out, leaving Gerald too furious to speakfor five minutes afterward. Although Crowley resentfully characterized him as a“quack painter,” Kelly would be commissioned to do the state portraits of KingGeorge VI and Queen Elizabeth in 1938, knighted in 1945, and elected presidentof the Royal Academy in 1949, among other honors. He is remembered as “the mostreliable portrait painter of his time.”26[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts026]The order known asA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]came into its own in the first months of 1909. Although commonly referred to asthe Argenteum Astrum (Latin for “Silver Star”) or some variation thereon, thetrue name of the order was never publicly disclosed. As a preliminary stroke,Crowley anonymously released the tables of correspondences under the title 777(1909), a number which refers to the flashing sword of creation superimposed onthe Tree of Life. Walter Scott published the slim fifty-four–page volume. Whilethe Occult Review praised its comprehensiveness in publishing what “has beenjealously and foolishly kept secret in the past,”27[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts027] Allan Bennett’s BuddhistReview curiously found it obscure and undignified. In his personal copy of thebook, GD member F. Leigh Gardner called it “Borrowed Plumes” from the GoldenDawn.28 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts028] Indeed, the bookexpanded on the original tables of correspondence compiled by MacGregor Mathers,Allan Bennett, and George Cecil Jones.Crowley had no time to worry about reactions to his newest book. Now that theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]was taking on students, it was time to go public with the order’s officialorgan. He had already laid the groundwork by December, 1908, and on the springequinox of 1909—March 20—Crowley unveiled to the unsuspecting public hisbiannual journal, The Equinox.But, he thought, how would it look for a great teacher to make vast sums ofmoney on his occult knowledge? He would look like a con man, peddling “SecretKnowledge” to the man on the street while he himself lived like a king. No, ithad to look like the rewards of initiation were so great that material rewardwas meaningless. He decided to make no money on this venture; his books on magichad to sell at or below cost. Thus no one could accuse him of profiting from hislearning.The Equinox was his most ambitious project to date. A ponderous, hardoverjournal, its first number was 255 pages long plus a 139-page supplement. Itfeatured pieces by Crowley, Neuburg, and Fuller, plus contributions from VanityFair editor Frank Harris, Lord Dunsany, and chemist Edward Whineray. The titlepage said it all:THE EQUINOXThe Official Organ of theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]The Review of Scientific Illuminism“The Method of Science—The Aim of Religion”The editorial announced the existence of theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg],calling on students to contact the chancellor at their business address. Thechancellor was Frater NSF (None Sine Fulmine, “Not without fire”), which wasFuller’s motto as Adeptus Minor (5°=6°), the first grade in the Second Order.The contents, almost entirely by Crowley, ranged widely. “An Account ofA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]”“digested Eckhartshausen’s Cloud upon the Sanctuary, borrowing freely fromMadame de Steiger’s translation. “Liber Librae” was an instruction onequilibrium, a lightly edited version of the GD’s Practicus 3°=8° paper onethics.29 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts029] “Liber E,” aimed atthe beginning student, gave basic instructions in journal-keeping, clairvoyance,and yoga, plus a recommended course of reading. Other pieces included “TheChymical Jousting of Brother Perardua” (an allegorical look at initiation), “Atthe Fork in the Roads” (a dramatization of Crowley’s encounter with AltheaGyles), “The Soldier and the Hunchback: ! and ?,” and Crowley’s serializedbiography by Fuller, “The Temple of Solomon the King.” The special supplementfeatured Crowley’s “John St. John” diary.Even though Crowley priced The Equinox at cost, the production by SimpkinMarshall was nevertheless expensive. Fifty subscription copies sold at oneguinea, while another thousand, issued in boards, went for five shillings.Nevertheless, the book sold like hotcakes and would have made money if Crowley’soverhead wasn’t so high.30 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts030]Reactions to the journal varied as widely as its contents. Reviewers from smalljournals like Light and the Literary Guide considered it “expensively printedlunacy … in oriental-occidental jargon,” but the big guns praised it: FrankHarris, who had a stake as an Equinox contributor, considered it permanent inboth production and value in his Vanity Fair review. The New Age offered a mixedreview, calling it “finely unpopular,” but acknowledging it as “large andluxurious”; they recommended that readers to pick it up if only for FrankHarris’s “The Magic Glasses,” warning Crowley that “If The Equinox can live upto this standard it will be bought by the profane.”31[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts031] Meanwhile, the Morning Leaderwrote:It is a sort of thing no fellow can understand. One gathers vaguely out of theconfusion that it deals with such things as Magic, wizardry, mysticism and soon … From frequent references to some people called The Brothers of theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]one gathers that they have a lot to do with this weird venture; but a grimperusal of an article purporting to explain the Order … leaves one without anyreal clue as to their identity.32[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts032]The Review of Reviews put it more succinctly: “A strange, weird,incomprehensible magazine is the Equinox, whose publication is a curious sign ofthe times.”33 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts033] These lastreviews are probably how the typical reader took it: with confusion andconsternation.

Although Warren contributed a review to thethird issue of The Equinox, he finally quit on October 14, 1910—shortly afterhis one-year probationary period. He instead applied for membership in A. E.Waite’s version of the GD, the Independent and Rectified Order R.R. et A.C., onOctober 24 with the motto “Amor et Veritas.”39[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts039] He died on September 19, 1912,after ten days’ struggle with acute lobar pneumonia that developed intopericarditis.40 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts040]Austin Osman Spare (1886–1956) was a handsome London artist with black curlyhair and striking Mediterranean features. The fifth of six children born toLondon constable Philip Spare and his wife Eliza, his proclivity for drawing wasencouraged by evening classes at the Lambeth Art School and later the RoyalCollege of Art. At age seventeen, he sent two black-and-white drawings to theRoyal Academy; both were accepted and one hung, making Spare the youngestexhibitor ever to be shown at the Royal Academy.41[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts041] The following year, 1905, theacademy accepted a work titled “The Resurrection of Zoroaster,” which the pressdescribed as “a strange example of fantastic symbolism, gloomy, tragic and veryoriginal.”42 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts042] In 1905 he putout his first book, Earth Inferno, followed by Book of Satyrs (1907).43[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts043] By October 1907, at agetwenty, his first exhibition—at the Brunton Gallery in London’s West End—causedquite a stir, causing The Art Journal, in its February 1908 issue, to proclaim,“There must be few people in London interested in art who do not know the nameof Austin Osman Spare.”44 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts044] WhenCrowley apparently sought him out45[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts045] in 1909, he was working on hismasterwork, The Book of Pleasure,46[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts046] which Freud would call “one ofthe most significant revelations of subconscious mechanisms that had appeared inmodern times.”47 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts047] Spare joinedtheA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]on July 10, 1909, as Yihoveaum, a motto that merged the great Hebrew andSanskrit holy words Jehovah and om.

As Ansell has suggested, Spare’s artistic ethos ofblurring and defying categories was not well suited to Crowley’s highlystructured system.49 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts049]Horace Algernon Sheridan-Bickers (1883–1957)50[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts050] signed up on July 23, choosingthe motto “Superabo” (I will excel).

Born in Cannes toUkranian Jewish banker Gregor Raffalovich, his father died in Paris in 1881shortly after George’s birth.64[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts064] His mother was reputedly acountess descended from one of Napoleon’s ministers of finance, and Georgesquandered his fortune on wild extravagances like buying a circus. Fortunately,his family had set money aside for him, and they pulled him out of the hole andset him back on his feet.65 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts065] Hehad a Bachelier ès Lettres from Nancy-Université,66[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts066] and when Crowley met him inLondon, Raffalovich was living in Putney and associated with Vanity Fairmagazine.67 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts067] He had recentlypublished Planetary Journeys and Earthly Sketches (1908)—of which Britishnovelist and political activist Israel Zangwill (1864–1926) wrote “Your trips toa Planet betray, if I may say so, a very modern feeling of the plasticity of theuniverse, together with a sense of the comparative values which to my mind isthe highest manifestation of the human reason”68[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts068]—followed by “Nadia,” a shortstory of the Russian Revolution, in The Idler.69[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts069] AC found him a gentleman with“a remarkable imagination and a brilliant ability to use the bizarre.”70[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts070] Seeing some of himself inRaffalovich—he had also spent his fortune and quarreled with his family, and nowprofessed great interest and knowledge in magic—Crowley helped him to becomenaturalized in 1910. Raffalovich repaid the money AC lent him in cash, andimmortalized him in his stories as Elphenor Pistouillat de la Ratisboisière.71[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts071] He contributed regularly toThe Equinox,72 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts072] andparticipated in its London activities. Neuburg dedicated two pieces in TheTriumph of Pan73 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts073] to him aswell.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_036_r1.jpg]George Raffalovich (1880–1958) in 1921.

Francis Henry Everard Joseph Feilding (1867–1936, commonly misspelled“Fielding”) was an eleventh-generation descendant of King Henry VIII andCatherine of Aragon. The second son of the 8th Earl of Denbigh Rudolph WilliamBasil Feilding (1823–1892) and Mary Berkeley (d. 1901), he was brother to thecurrent 9th Earl of Denbigh, Rudolph Robert Basil Aloysius Augustine Feilding.Everard Feilding had served as a midshipman in the Royal Navy and fought in theEgypt Campaign in 1882. Educated at Oscott, he was admitted to Trinity Collegein 1887, earned his bachelors of law degree in 1890, and was called to the barin 1894.74 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts074] Friends recalledhim as “full of humour, possessed of very unusual abilities, well read, fond ofargument in conversation, and with a fund of information on all the variedthings in life he had come across.”75[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts075] He was also a gifted musician,able to sight-read the most difficult selections. He was also active asSecretary of the Society for Psychical Research from 1903 to 1920. After hisbrother Basil died in a boating accident in August 1906, Feilding’s interestheightened, and he obtained “a reasonably extensive experience in theinvestigation of psychical phenomena and the advantage of a fairly completeeducation at the hands of fraudulent mediums.”76[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts076] He is well known as one of theinvestigators of Italian spiritualist medium Eusapia Palladino (1854–1918) inNaples; although initially convinced of her abilities, Feilding returned foranother investigation in 1910 and concluded that she was a fraud.77[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts077] As the character Lord AnthonyBowling in Moonchild, Crowley calls Feilding a familiar friend.He was a stout and strong man of nearly fifty years of age, with a gaze bothintrepid and acute.… Haughtiness was here, and great good-nature; the intellectwas evidently developed to the highest possible pitch of which man is capable;and one could read the judicial habit on his deep wide brows. Against this onecould see the huge force of the man’s soul, the passionate desire for knowledgewhich burnt in that great brain.…This man was the mainstay of the Society for Psychical Research. He was the onlyabsolutely competent man in it.78[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts078]He joined theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]on August 21, selecting as his motto “Ut Deum Inveniam” (That I will meet withGod). With the onset of World War I, Feilding—as a barrister, a member of theCommittee of Naval Censors’ Press Bureau, and a Lieutenant in the SpecialIntelligence Department—would prove a valuable contact for Crowley.Herbert Edward Inman was an engineer who had been elected to the LiverpoolEngineering Society on November 29, 1905; he would go on to serve as a privatewith the Royal Engineers during World War I, receiving the Allied Victory andBritish War medals.79 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts079] Inmanjoined theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]on October 22, 1909, as Frater Amor Clavis Vitae (Love is the Key to Life).Although he recruited one other member, he soon faded from theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]’sranks. Although Inman reportedly broke with Crowley over a bad debt,80[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts080] the two remained in touch evenin the 1940s.81 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts081]Charles Robert John Stansfeld Jones (1886–1950) became a probationer on December24, taking the motto Unus in Omnibus (One in all), or VIO, in Fuller’s presence.Jones was born in London on April 2, 1886, and baptized on June 1 at SaintLuke’s in Chelsea, the youngest of seven children to iron merchant William JohnJones and his wife Eliza.82 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts082] Inthe summer of 1907 he married Prudence R.

In 1909 he bought The Equinoxand joined theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg].He met Crowley at this time, but his primary instructor was Fuller. In May 1910,he moved to British Columbia, where he worked as an accountant and quicklybecame one of Crowley’s most devoted followers; in later years, when a frienddiscovered Jones at the roadside staring sadly at his broken-down Ford, thisacquaintance snidely suggested reading AC’s erotic verse to the car. Jonesreplied, “I’ve already tried that, but she just drips oil.”Finally, there was Kenneth Martin Ward (1887–1927), whom Crowley had previouslymet at Wastdale Head during the winter of 1908. Friends described him as“Amazingly clever and full of the weirdest conglomeration of beliefs.”84[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts084] Born in 1887 in Cambridge toJames and Mary Jane Ward,85 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c08-nts085] hestood over six feet tall and dressed unconventionally. He was a well-roundedscholar and sportsman from Emmanuel who entered Cambridge in October 1906 on aphysics and chemistry scholarship and got first class marks in his mathematicstripos. Besides intellectual pursuits, Ward was also an avid gymnast, boxer, andswimmer. Taking up sea-cliff climbing as an undergraduate, he made severalhistorical ascents and, during a visit to the chalk cliffs of Wastdale Head thatwinter, met Crowley. Returning to school to find math and physics spirituallyunsatisfying, he ventured instead into literature, philosophy, and art. Thisultimately led him to pursue, through Crowley, an introduction to the PanSociety. He became one of theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]’searliest members on May 25, 1909, actively recruiting three more probationersand helping to found the Cambridge Freethought Association to host Crowley’stalks. (Ward himself was the president, and Pinsent and Neuburg the committee.)Neuburg dedicated “The Thinker” in his The Triumph of Pan to Ward.Ward visited Crowley at Boleskine the summer of 1909 to discuss both businessand pleasure. With the second issue of The Equinox in the works, AC turned hismind toward the third, fourth, and fifth issues, with plans to explain JohnDee’s Enochian magic. Since they were both climbers, conversation soon turned tosports. Ward mentioned he would like to learn to ski, and Crowley, who’d learnedto skate and ski during his winters in St. Moritz, promised Ward one of hisspare pairs of skis.Unfortunately, he couldn’t remember where he had placed either his Enochiantablets or his skis.Rummaging through his attic on June 28, Crowley found more than he bargainedfor. Yes, he located the Enochian tablets. He even ran across his skis.Moreover, among the other items in storage, he found a nearly forgotten,long-lost relic: the original manuscript of The Book of the Law.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_037_r1.jpg]Kenneth Martin Ward (1887–1927). (photo credit 8.2)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c08-fig002a]An eerie feeling settled over Crowley as he looked at the pages. Up to thatpoint, he had been working off a typescript of the book, assuming the originalhad been lost. But now …As a Magister Templi, he was sworn to interpret every event as a dealing of Godwith his life. So what of this? Crowley reasoned that, just as the masters madesure he became interested in mountaineering so he could discover the GD, theynow ensured that Ward would enter the picture and lead to the rediscovery of TheBook of the Law. This event was designed, and it was of the utmost significance.It forced Crowley to take a more serious look at the book than he ever hadbefore. He realized this was more than his destiny: it was his True Will."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINETHE VISION AND THE VOICEHis faith in the Secret Chiefs and their message renewed, Crowley returned toLondon with his students and took a flat at 124 Victoria Street as the officesof The Equinox. He decorated the rooms with red curtains, a stuffed crocodile,and several Buddhas, then began work on the second issue. It appeared on theautumnal equinox, September 20, 1909, with a colorful assortment of articles:Crowley contributed an essay on the psychology of hashish as “Oliver Haddo,” hisfictitious counterpart in Maugham’s The Magician. Lord Dunsany (1878–1957)offered the short story “A Sphinx at Gizeh,”1[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts001] Neuburg “The Lost Shepherd,”Crowley’s Cambridge follower G. H. S. Pinsent2[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts002] “The Organ in King’s Chapel,Cambridge,” Allan Bennett “A Note on Genesis,” and George Raffalovich “TheMan-Cover.” Spare provided illustrations for the article “A Handbook ofGeomancy.” Most significantly, Fuller, under Crowley’s supervision, contributedthe second installment of “The Temple of Solomon the King.” This chapterrecounted Crowley’s initiation into the GD, reproducing every one of its FirstOrder rituals. Crowley believed the Secret Chiefs had released him from his vowof secrecy; as The Book of the Law put it: “Behold! the rituals of the old timeare black.”3 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts003] By publishingthese secrets, he dissipated their power in favor of the new order.The Veil of Isis was lifted, and the whole world looked on the undergarments ofthe GD. Crowley promised to remove even these in the next issue, which wouldcontain the remainder of the GD corpus.Meanwhile, Clouds without Water appeared under the pseudonym of Reverend C.Verey. The book is a farce, supposedly edited from a private manuscript toreveal the horrors to which Satan can drive lost sheep. Its preface contains theodd semibiographical lines, “the wife of the man, driven to drink andprostitution by the inhuman cruelty of his mistress,” paralleling Crowley’spersonal problems. Poetry formed the bulk of the text, with ridiculously piousend notes on its content (“only a Latin dictionary can unveil the loathsomehorror” of the word “fellatrix”). It closes with a prayer for redemption.While many of the poems grew out of his affair with Lola (Vera Bentrovata),Crowley loses sight of her part way through and recalls Rodin’s student,sculptress Kathleen Bruce. Poems V, VI, and VII are for her, and her name evenappears as an acrostic in the opening “Terzain”:King of myself, I labour to espouseAn equal soul. Alas! how frail I findThe golden light within the gilded house.Helpless and passionate, and weak of mind!Lechers and lepers!—all as ivy cling,Emasculate the healthy bole they haunt.Eternity is pregnant; I shall singNow—by my power—a spirit grave and gauntBrilliant and selfish, hard and hot, to flauntReared like a flame across the lampless west,Until by love or laughter we enchaunt,Compel ye to Kithairon’s thorny crest—Evoe! Iacche! consummatum est.Her new husband, explorer Robert Scott, was reportedly furious to find hiswife’s name in this bizarre book.The sharp division between Crowley’s private and magical lives was morepronounced than ever. Although magic proceeded well, he nevertheless spent muchof that summer in the Thames valley, brooding over his forthcoming divorce. Ashe put it, “My soul was badly bruised by the ruin of my romance.”4[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts004] Seeking solace in hischildhood nostalgia for weirs, Crowley spent time late that summer in a canoe onBoulter’s Lock, Maidenhead, on the Thames thirty miles west of London. There, ina sixty-hour marathon session, he wrote his classic mystic poem, “Aha!” In theform of a dialogue between the teacher Marsyas (Crowley) and his pupil Olympas(any seeker), it describes the many mystical states he had experienced along thepath to becoming a Master of the Temple, including the subjects of equilibrium,the veil of matter (paroketh), the knowledge and conversation of the holyguardian angel, the vision of the universal peacock (atmadarshana), the ordealof the Abyss, the vanity of speech, the destruction of the ego, and the bliss oftranscendence (ananda). In particular, his discussion of the ordeal of the Abysspoignantly mirrors the heartache he was feeling as he penned these verses:MARSYAS. Easy to say. To abandon all,All must be first loved and possessed.Nor thou nor I have burst the thrall.All—as I offered half in jest,Sceptic—was torn away from me.Not without pain! THEY slew my child, Dragged my wife down to infamyLoathlier than death, drove to the wildMy tortured body, stripped me ofWealth, health, youth, beauty, ardour, love.Thou hast abandoned all? Then tryA speck of dust within the !eye!With his divorce pending, Crowley was vividly aware of the demands of the pathhe had chosen: he had thrown away his family and fortune to lead the life of amagician. “Aha!” stands not only as autobiography, but as a manual of spiritualattainment.As the date of his divorce approached, Crowley grew increasingly miserable. Ifthe event itself wasn’t bad enough, Rose was now seeking forgiveness and asecond chance. He had managed to refuse so far, but knew he would eventuallybreak down if she persisted. Thus he left town until the whole unpleasantbusiness was over.On November 10, 1909, Crowley and Neuburg left London for a walking vacation inAlgeria. They arrived in Algiers a week later, purchased provisions, and headedsouth with no plan other than to rough it a few days in a new place. They campedin the open for two nights and slept in a primitive hotel a third beforearriving at Aumale, about sixty miles southeast of Algiers, on November 21. Theplace felt right, so they bought notebooks and settled in.Going through his rucksack, Crowley examined the papers he had brought onEnochian magic. He planned to publish them in a future Equinox, but they nowheld a greater usefulness for him. Recalling his abortive attempts at doing theThirty Calls during his visit to Mexico nine years ago, he realized a lot hadchanged since 1900. He was a Master of the Temple now. Perhaps the barriers thatonce blocked the 28th Aethyr from him would now yield.After dinner on November 23, Crowley and Neuburg found a secluded place in thedesert. AC removed his scarlet calvary cross inset with a huge topaz. He gazedinto the stone while concentrating on his third eye, the ajna chakra, and whenhe felt prepared to receive a vision, he began the 28th Call in the AngelicLanguage: “Madariatza das perifa BAG cahisa micaolazoda saanire caosago odfifisa balzodizodarasa Iaida.” In English, it meant, “The heavens that dwell inthe 28th Aire are mighty in the Parts of the Earth, and execute the judgement ofthe Highest!” Completing the conjuration, he gazed into the topaz and describedwhat he saw and the words that came to him. Neuburg, with pen and notebook,recorded what followed:There cometh an Angel into the stone with opalescent shining garments like awheel of fire on every side of him, and in his hand is a long flail of scarletlightning; his face is black, and his eyes white without any pupil or iris. Theface is very terrible indeed to look upon. Now in front of him is a wheel, withmany spokes, and many tyres; it is like a fence in front of him.And he cries: O man, who art thou that wouldst penetrate the Mystery? for it ishidden unto the End of Time.5 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts005]And so it began. The entire vision lasted an hour.The Edinburgh courtroom came to order on November 24 to hear the uncontestedcomplaint of Rose Edith Crowley (formerly Skerrett, née Kelly) against herhusband, Edward Alexander Crowley, a.k.a. Lord Boleskine and Count MacGregor.Lord Edward Theodore Salvesen (1857–1942)6[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts006] listened carefully from thebench as the thirty-five-year-old pursuer gave her testimony, from her 1897marriage, her elopement six years later, the birth of their first daughter, herabandonment in China, and the death of their child. Mr. Jameson, who questionedRose, asked, “When you met the defendant, was he then calling himself AleisterCrowley?”She shook her head. “No, he was then Count Svareff. I knew, however, his realname was Edward Alexander Crowley. Later he called himself MacGregor in order toidentify himself with Scotland. That’s the name he used on our marriagecertificate, although he gave his father’s name as Edward Crowley. Shortly afterwe were wed, he began using the name Lord Boleskine. He said it was becauseScots took the names of their property.”“I take it he is a little eccentric?”“Oh, yes!”The damning evidence came when she described her complaint against Crowley. Thatsummer, on July 21, she left him and took a house on Warwick Road because he hadbeen beating her. Two weeks later, according to testimony from Mrs. Dauby thecharwoman (whom Crowley had called a drunken ex-prostitute), Master Crowley hada woman with him: he had asked Dauby to bring them tea in the library thatevening, and again in the morning. Throughout the night, she heard laughtercoming from the room. If that weren’t scandalous enough, the chauffeur, CharlesRandle, testified that Crowley had fathered a child by a friend of his. WhenGerald Kelly took the stand, he confessed that, although he was Crowley’sfriend, he knew little about his background. AC, he said, purchased Boleskinefor far more than its worth; the manor had a lot of land, but most of it wasperpendicular. Crowley, he said, was very stupid about money.“You said he is a writer,” Salvesen posited. “Does he make anything by it?”Gerald snorted. “Certainly not.”Salvesen considered the case, granted Rose her divorce, and awarded her custodyof Lola Zaza, with £1 a week as alimony. Since Crowley had spent his fortune onpublishing and mountaineering adventures, he had no money to offer as asettlement, but with the help of Dennes & Co., he set up a trust fund into whichwould be deposited the £4,000 he would receive when his mother died; these fundswould be divided between Crowley and Lola at the discretion of the trustees,Jones and Eckenstein.Looking at Crowley’s photograph, the judge sat back and mused. “He looks as ifhe belonged to the stage.”Jameson said, “He is a literary character, sir. He rather affects theartistic.”7 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts007][images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_038_r1.jpg]The Crowley family—Rose, Lola Zaza, and Aleister—taken shortly after thedivorce. (photo credit 9.1) [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c09-fig001a]In retrospect, their marriage was flawed even before alcohol became an issue.Admittedly, Rose’s love inspired passionate songs from the poet, just asLilith’s death devastated him and the collapse of their marriage depressed him.And although comparatively uneducated and undisciplined, she was a valuablemagical partner, leading AC to The Book of the Law, participating in hisrituals, and scrying for his friends. Nevertheless, AC placed her third in hislife, after books and magic. They shared little in common: he was a writer, sheuninterested in literature. Moreover, they spent little time together: shortlyafter their marriage, he went on his expedition to Kangchenjunga; left her againin China to travel to America; went on a cruise with Tankerville; and maintainedseparate residences in London and Paris. In the end, theirs appears to have beena marriage held together by little more than the romance of their elopement.While the divorce unfolded, Crowley and Neuburg headed out of Aumale into theheart of Algeria. Crowley wore a robe and turban and read from the Qur’an asthey marched across the desert. Neuburg’s head was shaved except for two tuftsof hair that he twisted into horns. Thus Crowley led his familiar djinn about ona chain, to the amazement of the locals.That evening, they reached Sidi Aissa and, at 8 p.m., performed the 27th Call.From there, they proceeded to Bou Sâada, where they spent most of their trip. Itwas a quaint little town with houses gathered upon a hill in the middle of thedesert. A stream ran through the land below, framed with palms, cacti, orchards,and gardens.As they regressed through the Thirty Aethyrs over the course of the next month,Crowley and Neuburg recorded the visions—apocalyptic, passionate, andinspired—which they experienced. AC encountered angels, streams of fire,dragons, ringing bells, and a landscape of knives. When they evoked the 21stAethyr on November 29, Crowley faced an invisible entity that spoke by rapidlyplacing tastes into Crowley’s mouth: salt, honey, sugar, asafoetida, bitumen,honey. As they progressed, Crowley understood the images to unify every systemof magical attainment.The Calls also initiated him into greater and greater mysteries. In the 15thAethyr (December 3), a group of Adepts examined Frater Perdurabo at theirSabbath. The first one thrust a dagger into Crowley’s heart, tasted his blood,and spoke the Greek word katharos, thus deeming him at least an Adeptus Minor(5°=6°); indeed, he had received this initiation in 1900 from Mathers himself inParis. The second, testing the muscles of his right shoulder and arm, pronouncedthe Latin word fortis, signifying he was an Adeptus Major (6°=5°). The third,examining his skin and tasting the sweat of his left arm, uttered the Enochianword TAN, declaring him Adeptus Exemptus (7°=4°), an exempt adept at the top ofthe Second Order’s hierarchy. The fourth, examining his neck, said nothing, thenopened the right half of his brain and pronounced the Sanskrit samajh. He hadcrossed the abyss and was a Magister Templi (8°=3°).A fifth Adept approached, examined the left half of Crowley’s brain, ponderedhis evidence, and stiffened. He raised his hand in protest and, in his language,declared Crowley was not yet a Magus, 9°=2°: “In the thick of darkness the seedawaiteth spring.” AC still belonged to the first of the three grades of thethird and highest order, the Silver Star.This vision occurred between 9:15 and 11:10 in the morning. Later thatafternoon, the magicians climbed the mountain Dáleh Addin in the desert and, at2:50, attempted to obtain a vision of the 14th Aethyr, named UTI in Enochian. Ashe proceeded, Crowley encountered thick veils of darkness. Tearing his waythrough the veils, trying to penetrate their mystery, the darkness was endless.Finally, a voice instructed him, “Depart! For thou must invoke me only in thedarkness. Therein will I appear, and reveal unto thee the Mystery of UTI. Forthe Mystery thereof is great and terrible. And it shall not be spoken in sightof the sun.”At 3:15, Crowley abandoned the vision.Descending the mountain, inspiration seized Crowley. He suggested they gatherrocks and build a stone circle around a rough stone altar dedicated to Pan. Thisthey did, and wrote magical words of power in the sand. With the templeestablished, they now needed to worship the deity. A sacrifice was customary,but Crowley had no animal with him. He knew, however, that sacrifices oftensymbolized the sex act, the spilling of the seed of life. So upon the makeshiftaltar, beneath the desert sun, Victor assumed the active role in an act of analsex with his master.Crowley staggered back to Bou Sâada in a drunken state of spiritual ecstasy andcollapsed on his bed, feeling insights he had never known before. In his ownwords, the ritual “produced a great wonder,” for he realized for the first timewhat power could be wielded by using sex in ritual. He also accepted thehomosexual component of his sexuality; this stood in sharp contrast to hiscollege relationship with Pollitt, which ended with bitterness andrecriminations. The indulgence and transcendence of the last taboo thatVictorian-Christian mores had programmed into him completely obliterated“Aleister Crowley” and erased his ego. As he wrote:It was a repetition of my experience of 1905, but far more actual. I did notmerely admit that I did not exist, and that all my ideas were illusions, inaneand insane. I felt these facts as facts. It was the difference between bookknowledge and experience.… All things were alike as shadows sweeping across thestill surface of a lake—their images had no meaning for the water, no power tostir its silence.8 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts008]Through the Enochian Calls, Crowley was reliving all the initiations he hadexperienced: up to this point, he had had sporadic enlightenments that gave himclaim to the exalted grades of theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg],but now he was systematically and formally going through his initiations.For Victor, that day marked the consummation of a love that had grown steadilywithin him, and which would never in his life find equal.At 9:50 that evening, they again tried the Call of the 14th Aethyr. This timethe consciousness that had been Crowley penetrated the veil, encountered theangel, and by 11:15 was confirmed as one of the masters.The remaining visions instructed him in what lay ahead. The 13th Aethyrdescribed the work undertaken by a Master of the Temple (8°=3°). The 12thdescribed the City of the Pyramids, the allegorical name for the third sephira,Binah, on the Tree of Life, which represents the 8°=3° grade. Having been fullyinstructed on the Grade of the Magister Templi and having had his lease in theCity of Pyramids approved, he could now move in. All he had to do was rituallyrecross the Abyss. Staring into the dark wind-swept void, Crowley beseeched hisholy guardian angel, “Is there not one appointed as a warden?”Aiwass replied with the torment-spawned last words of Jesus, “Eloi, Eloi, lamasabacthani.”9 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts009]Returning from the 11th Aethyr, Crowley knew he was alone. Just as he hadtrodden upon mountains where no one had previously set foot, there was no otherperson living in the areas he now ventured.“Accursed” was John Dee’s word for the 10th Aethyr. Its path crossed the Abyss,but Choronzon, the demon of dispersion, guarded the higher grades from thoseunprepared. Edward Kelly called him “that mighty devil,” the first and deadliestof all evil powers. Crowley and Neuburg knew they needed to be prepared toencounter this infernal entity.On December 6, the magicians wandered until they found a suitable spot in adesert valley filled with white sand. Sparing no precaution, they gatheredstones and arranged them in a huge circle. Around it they traced the protectivekabbalistic names of God in the sand: Yahweh, Shaddai El Chai, and ARARITA. Dueeast of the circle, they inscribed a triangle which enclosed the name Choronzon.To fortify it, they wrote on each of its sides a sacred name as advised in theGoetia: ANAPHAXETON, ANAPHANETON, and PRIMEUMATON. At its vertices they put apair of letters from the name of MI-CA-EL, the archangel bearing the fierysword. Into this space they would summon the demon. And in this same spaceCrowley, robed in black, would scry. Neuburg sat in the fortified circle; hisduties were to use his consecrated dagger to command and contain Choronzon inthe Triangle of the Art, and to record the content of the vision in hisnotebook. So grave and serious was this responsibility that he swore an oath:I, Omnia Vincam, a Probationer ofA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg],hereby solemnly promise upon my magical honour, and swear by Adonai the angelthat guardeth me, that I will defend this magic circle of Art with thoughts andwords and deeds. I promise to threaten with the Dagger to command back into thetriangle the spirit incontinent, if he should strive to escape from it; and tostrike with a Dagger at anything that may seek to enter this Circle, were it inappearance the body of the Seer himself. And I will be exceeding wary, armedagainst force and cunning; and I will preserve with my life the inviolability ofthis circle, Amen. And I summon mine Holy Guardian Angel to witness this mineoath, the which if I break, may I perish, forsaken of Him. Amen and Amen.10[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts010]Crowley performed banishing rituals of both the pentagram and hexagram, purgingtheir workplace of both elemental and planetary forces. Then, calling on thesacred names of God, he recited the exorcism of Honorius:O Lord, deliver me from hell’s great fear and gloom!Loose thou my spirit from the larvae of the tomb!I seek them in their dread abodes without affright:On them will I impose my will, the law of light.…Their faces and their shapes are terrible and strange.These devils by my might to angels I will change.These nameless horrors I address without affright:On them will I impose my will, the law of light.These are the phantoms pale of mine astonished view,Yet none but I their blasted beauty can renew:For to the abyss of hell I plunge without affright:On them will I impose my will, the law of light.11[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts011]Traditionally, blood sacrifices helped provide the life essence a spirit neededto materialize. In order to assure a clear encounter with the guardian of theAbyss, he slit the throat of a pigeon at each vertex of the triangle and allowedits blood to drain out, all the while being careful that every drop stayedwithin the triangle lest its barriers be breached. Sacrifice was a practice asold as the Hindu, Jewish, and Greek religions, and this one represented one ofthe few he would make in his lifetime.12[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts012] Once the blood soakedcompletely into the sand, Crowley squatted in the thunderbolt asana and recitedthe Call of the 10th Aethyr, called ZAX.The vision began with a deep, chilling voice crying aloud, “Zazas, Zazas,Nasatanada Zazas.” According to tradition, Adam once opened the gates of hellwith these words. This time, Choronzon entered their midst.“I am the Master of Form,” the demon declared, “and from me all forms proceed. Iam I. I have shut myself up from the spendthrifts, my gold is safe in mytreasure-chamber, and I have made every living thing my concubine, and noneshall touch them, save only I. From me come leprosy and pox and plague andcancer and cholera and the falling sickness. Ah! I will reach up to the knees ofthe Most High, and tear his phallus with my teeth, and I will bray his testiclesin a mortar, and make poison thereof, to slay the sons of men.”Next, Neuburg heard Crowley say, “I don’t think I can get any more; I thinkthat’s all there is.” He was not fooled. Choronzon was mimicking his master’svoice.Suddenly, Euphemia Lamb appeared before him, tempting and inviting him to makelove to her. Neuburg shook his head, attempting to dispel the hallucination.This was another of Choronzon’s tricks, an attempt to lure him out of theprotective circle. Neuburg refused to comply. In the face of hideous, loudlaughter that echoed wildly about the valley, Neuburg commanded him to proceedwith the vision.“They have called me the God of laughter, and I laugh when I will slay. And theyhave thought that I could not smile, but I smile upon whom I would seduce, Oinviolable one, that canst not be tempted.” With that, Choronzon slipped in anappeal to Neuburg’s pride and vanity: “I bow myself humbly before the great andterrible names whereby thou hast conjured and constrained me. Let me come andput my head beneath thy feet, that I may serve thee. For if thou commandest meto obedience in the Holy names, I cannot swerve therefrom. Bid me therefore comeunto thee upon my hands and knees that I may adore thee, and partake of thyforgiveness.”“Back, demon!” Neuburg commanded. “And continue with the vision!”He did. “Choronzon hath no form, because he is the maker of all form; and sorapidly he changeth from one to the other as he may best think fit to seducethose whom he hateth, the servants of the Most High. Thus taketh he the form ofa beautiful woman.” And so he did. “Or of a wise and holy man.” He did so again.“Or of a serpent that writheth upon the earth ready to sting.” And again. Then,shifting gears, Choronzon interrupted his dialogue with a request: “The sunburns him as he writhes naked upon the sands of hell so that he is sore athirst.Give unto me, I pray thee, one drop of water from the pure springs of Paradise,that I may quench my thirst.”Neuburg held his post and offered no water. “Continue with the vision!”Next, Crowley’s voice came from the triangle. “Sprinkle water on my head. I canhardly go on!”Again calling upon the names of god, Neuburg commanded the uncooperative spiritto continue. He hedged, and Victor cursed him with the names and the pentagram.Undaunted, Choronzon simply roared back at the Neophyte. “I feed upon the namesof the Most High. I churn them in my jaws, and I void them from my fundament. Ifear not the power of the Pentagram, for I am the Master of the Triangle. Bevigilant, therefore, for I warn thee that I am about to deceive thee. I shallsay words that thou wilt take to be the cry of the Aethyr, and thou wilt writethem down, thinking them to be great secrets of Magick power, and they will beonly my jesting with thee.”His was an unsettling declaration, as one of the basic assumptions of magic wasthat the true names of God compelled all spirits. But this chaotic entity thatthey had called forth openly defied these laws. Shaken, Victor commanded, “Inthe name of Aiwass, continue!”The demon quickly shot back, “I know the name of the Angel of thee and thybrother Perdurabo. All thy dealings with him are but a cloak for thy filthysorceries.”Neuburg replied indignantly to that remark, “I know more than you, foul demon,and I do not fear you. I command you to proceed.”“Thou canst tell me naught that I know not, for in me is all Knowledge:Knowledge is my name.”“I tell you, proceed!”“Know thou that there is no Cry in the tenth Aethyr like unto the other Cries,for Choronzon is Dispersion, and cannot fix his mind upon any one thing for anylength of time. Thou canst master him in argument, O talkative one; thou wastcommanded, wast thou, not to talk to Choronzon? He sought not to enter thecircle, or to leave the triangle, yet thou didst prate of all these things. Woe,woe, woe, threefold to him that is led away by talk, O talkative One.”“I warn you, you anger me. Unless you wish to feel the pain of hell, continue.”Again Choronzon retorted, “Thinkest thou, O fool, that there is any anger andany pain that I am not, or any hell but this my spirit?” Next, he sprang into adialogue about Crowley’s stupidity. “O thou that hast written two-and-thirtybooks of Wisdom, and art more stupid than an owl, by thine own talk is thyvigilance wearied, and by my talk art thou befooled and tricked, O thou thatsayest that thou shalt endure. Knowest thou how nigh thou art to destruction? Iheard it said that Perdurabo could both will and know, and might learn at lengthto dare, but that to keep silence he should never learn.”His words came quicker and quicker. Neuburg, concentrating on his note book,scribbled frantically to keep up. With the magician suitably distracted,Choronzon tossed sand on the circle, trying to fill it in as he rambled. Then,running out of things to say, the demon began reciting “Tom o’ Bedlam.”Neuburg may have realized in that moment that Choronzon was up to no good, butit was far too late. The demon sprang over the hole in the circle and threwNeuburg hard to the ground. They struggled and rolled in the sand. Choronzon, inthe form of a naked savage, tried to tear out Neuburg’s throat and bite throughthe bones of his neck with his frothing fangs. Neuburg, meanwhile, reacheddesperately for his dagger. Fingers closing around the hilt of the magicalweapon, Neuburg struck with the blade and called on the holy four-lettered nameof God, commanding Choronzon back to the triangle.And he obeyed.Neuburg repaired the breech in the circle, and the demon continued, “All isdispersion. These are the qualities of things. The tenth Aethyr is the world ofadjectives, and there is no substance therein.”The demon resumed the form of Lamb and again tempted Neuburg to no avail. Thenhe complained he was cold and asked permission to leave the triangle in order tofind something to cover his nakedness. Neuburg refused, and again threatenedChoronzon with retribution if he did not proceed.So he did. “I am commanded, why I know not, by him that speaketh. Were it thou,thou little fool, I would tear thee limb from limb. I would bite off thine earsand nose before I began with thee. I would take thy guts for fiddle-strings atthe Black Sabbath.” Then, taunting, “Thou didst make a great fight there in thecircle; thou art a goodly warrior!”“You cannot harm one hair of my head,” Victor stood firm.He roared, “I will pull out every hair of thy head! Every hair of thy body,every hair of thy soul, one by one.”“You have no power.”“Yea, verily, I have power over thee, for thou hast taken the Oath, and artbound unto the White Brothers, and therefore have I the power to torture thee solong as thou shalt be.”“You lie.”“Ask of thy brother Perdurabo, and he shall tell thee if I lie!”“No. It is no concern of yours.”At that, Choronzon taunted Neuburg, trying to convince him that magic was allgibberish, that the names of power were, in fact, powerless. Realizing that allwould be lost if he doubted for even an instant, Neuburg kept the demon at bay.Choronzon continued, “In this Aethyr is neither beginning nor end, for it is allhotch-potch, because it is of the wicked on earth, and the damned in hell. Andso long as it be hotch-potch, it mattereth little what may be written by thesea-green incorruptible Scribe. The horror of it will be given in another placeand time, and through another Seer, and that Seer shall be slain as a result ofhis revealing.”13 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts013]With that prophecy, the demon disappeared. Crowley knew he was gone. He removedhis magical ring and, with it, wrote the name BABALON in the sand. Two hoursafter beginning, the vision was over. Together, Crowley and Neuburg destroyedthe circle and triangle, scattering the rocks about. They lit a bonfire topurify the valley of the unholy power they had called to earth, and countedthemselves lucky to be alive.The next day, the Ninth Aethyr described Crowley’s ascent from the Abyss and hisarrival in the City of the Pyramids as a Magister Templi. Per its instructions,Crowley prostrated himself on the sand 1,001 times during the day’s march,reciting from the Qur’an:, Qul: Huwa Allâhu ahad; Allâhu alssamad; Lam yalidwalam yûlad; Walam yakul lahu kufuwan ahad.14[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts014]On December 8 they continued south, out of Bou-Sâada and toward the winterresort town of Biskra, over one hundred miles away. When one of Victor’srelatives arrived, worried for his safety, Crowley determined to let nothinginterfere with their plans. “Where’s Victor?” Crowley was asked.“There,” he replied, gesturing toward a dromedary. “I’ve turned him into acamel.” At that, he dismissed the chaperone and returned to his business.Crowley and Neuburg followed the southbound road out of Bou-Sâada only to findit ran out after only a few miles. The rest of the day they walked through theSahara, and that evening proceeded with the Eighth Aethyr.The visions proceeded regularly throughout their march, describing the grade ofMagus (9°=2°)—ninth in the hierarchy of ten grades and second from last—andCrowley’s final ascent as a Magister Templi into the Great White Brotherhood.On December 16 they finally reached Biskra, a resort town full of palm trees andcamels. They checked into the Royal Hotel, and Crowley dictated a thirteen-pageletter to Fuller. In it, he dealt with Equinox business and complainedincidentally about his difficulty in keeping Victor away from the bottoms ofArabic boys. While much has been made of this latter comment, it stands simplyto reason that Crowley was dictating to none other than Neuburg, and that thecomment was a joke; possibly one between Crowley and Neuburg, alluding to theirown physical involvement. The poem “At Bordj-an-Nus,” which Crowley wrote atthis time, sheds some light on this matter. When Crowley published it in TheEquinox, he signed it as “Hilda Norfolk” to disguise its homosexual undertones:The moon is down; we are alone;May not our mouths meet, madden, mix, melt in thestarlight of a kiss?El Arabi!There by the palms, the desert’s edge, I drew thee to myheart and heldThy shy slim beauty for a splendid second; and fellmoaning back,Smitten by Love’s forked flashing rod—as if theuprooted mandrake yelled!…Great is the love of God and manWhile I am trembling in thine arms, wild wanderer of wilderness!El Arabi!15 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts015]They called the Fourth Aethyr that evening at nine, learning more details aboutthe Grade of Magus. The third, second, and first Aethyrs followed in rapidsuccession, wrapping up on December 19 at 3:30 in the afternoon.With the conclusion of these visions, Crowley came to an understanding of theGreat White Brotherhood and its three highest grades. He fathomed the sacrificesof the Abyss; understood how, as a Master of the Temple living in the City ofthe Pyramids under the Dark Night of Pan, he must interpret every event as aparticular dealing of God with his soul; knew that as a Magus, he would becomethe Logos, the embodiment of the Word of the Aeon (Thelema), but be cursed tohave his speech interpreted as a lie; and learned about Babalon, who as aguardian of the Abyss gathered into her chalice the life blood of the ExemptAdept before he crossed the Abyss and, as the priestess or sacred prostitute ofthe Thelemic system, was the epitome of love under will. Reliving his ordeal ofthe Abyss and initiation into the Third Order, Crowley completely accepted TheBook of the Law and felt genuinely secure in his chosen role as its prophet.Even though he had claimed the grade previously, he now fully understood thetasks of a Magister Templi and knew like never before that he had reached thatgrade.Returning to Southampton in January 1910, Crowley kicked into high gear.Although he published various booklets for members of theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]—includingThelema (the Holy Books in three volumes), “Liber Causae” (an account of thecollapse of the GD and theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]’semergence therefrom, included in Thelema), and Liber Collegii Sancti (a bookletin which to record the progress of students)—his most personal production wasRosa Decidua, the fallen rose, the last in his series of poems about hisex-wife. The piece is a mournful dirge, a romantic lament over lost love:This is no tragedy of little tears.My brain is hard and cold; there is no beatOf its blood; there is no heatOf sacred fire upon my lips to sing.…I have no memory of the rose-red hours.No fragrance of those days amid the flowersLingers; all’s drowned in the accursèd stenchOf this damned present …See! I reel back beneath the blow of her breathAs she comes smiling to me: that disgustChanges her drunken lustInto a shriek of hate—half conscious still(Beneath the obsession of the will)Of all she was—before her death, her death!…Who asks me for my tears?She flings the body of our sweet dead childInto my face with hell’s own epitaph…And all my being is one throbOf anguish, and one inarticulate sobCatches my throat. All these vain voices die,And all these thunders venomously hurledStop. My head strikes the floor; one cry, the old cry,Strikes at the sky its exquisite agony:Rose! Rose o’ th’ World.Crowley printed only twenty copies of the eleven-page poem to commemorate thedivorce. It sported a green cover, with a friendly photograph of the poet withhis wife and daughter, taken shortly before the court date, tipped in. Crowleydedicated the piece to Lord Salvesen, who presided over the trial. With RosaDecidua, Crowley closed the door on a tragic phase of his life and bid farewellto his Rose of the World and her brother, Gerald of the Festuses.Business at the Equinox offices proceeded as usual toward publication of thenext issue, set to contain a wide assortment of contributions: a description ofthe tasks for students in theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg];Crowley’s “Aha!”; “The Shadowy Dill-Waters,” a spoof on Yeats; Baudelaire’s “ThePoem of Hashish,” translated by Crowley; poems by Neuburg and Arthur F. Grimble;a story by Raffalovich; and two installments by Fuller—“The Treasure-House ofImages” and the contentious “Temple of Solomon the King.”On March 11, solicitor George Rose Cran16[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts016] appeared and served Crowleywith a writ: Mathers was seeking an injunction to keep The Equinox frompublishing the remaining GD ritual, its 5°=6° R.R. et A.C.17[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts017] Or, in legalese, he wasrestraining the defendant, his servants, and agents from publishing, or causingto be printed or published in the third number of the book or magazine known asThe Equinox or otherwise disclosing any matter relating to the secrets, forms,rituals, or transactions of a certain order known as the Rosicrucian Order, ofwhich the plaintiff was the Chief or Head.18[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts018]“Balls,” Crowley cursed. The books were already printed and ready to be releasedin ten days. “Prophetically,” they offered a £10 reward for the source of afictitious clipping sent to him:Cox, Box, Equinox,McGregors are coming to Town;Some in rag, and some on jags,And the Swami upside down.Cran, Cran, MacGregor’s manServed a writ, and away he ran.19[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts019]This suggests he knew the writ was coming.On March 14, Mathers applied for an ex parte interim injunction, which JusticeBucknill granted on March 18. One day after the spring equinox, March 21,Crowley’s appeal came before the court. Hearing the case were appeals judgesVaughan Williams, Fletcher Moulton, and Farwell.20[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts020] The plaintiff, the ComteLiddell MacGregor, appeared with long white hair brushed straight back to revealthe withered features of his aging face. He was represented by Frederick Low andP. Rose-Innes. It was an impressive team: Sir Frederick Low (1856–1917) wasadmitted to the Middle Temple in 1890, invested as king’s counsel in 1902, andknighted in 1906; he would later serve as a member of Parliament for Norwichfrom 1910 to 1915, and as high court judge of the King’s Bench in 1915.21[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts021] Sir Patrick Rose-Innes(1853–1924) was called to the bar in 1878, established a reputation as aUnionist lawyer and tariff reformer, and in 1905 was appointed recorder ofSandwich and Ramsgate; he would go on to be knighted in 1918. While this mightseem an odd fit for the case, the hook may have originated with Rose-Innes’srole as provincial Masonic Grand Master for Aberdeenshire, which he would holdfrom 1905 to 1920: He may have been helping a fellow brother Mason, especiallyagainst someone breaking their oath of secrecy.22[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts022]Crowley’s men were W. Whately and A. Neilson for the firm of Messrs. Steadman,Van Praagh, and Gaylor. William Whately (1858–1937) was a London-bornBarrister-at-Law of the Inner Temple who would go on to be a Master of theSupreme Court.23 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts023] AlexanderNeilson (1868–1929) was educated at Fettes College and received his MA fromEdinburgh University, passing his exam for the Middle Temple in 1891 and beingcalled to the Bar in 1893; with a general practice in the Midland Circuit, “hiskindly nature and pleasant manner made him many attached friends.”24[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts024]The courtroom was packed. The last trial with this much interest occurred in1905, when Mrs. Eliza Dinah Sheffield brought a breach of promise case againstthe Marquis Townshend; she claimed to be High Priestess of the RosicrucianOrder, but as of late she was known only as a West End hostess. The presenttrial promised to be just as colorful.It began with Crowley’s man, Whately, reading Mathers’s affidavit:I am the chief of the Rosicrucian Order. It is an order instituted in its modernform in 1888 for the study of mystical philosophy and the mysteries ofantiquity. The order is upon the lines of the well-known institutions ofFreemasonry.The exclusive copyright of the rituals, ceremonies, and manuscripts of the orderis vested in me, I being founder and compiler of them, and I claim such aninterest in the same as will entitle me to restrain any infringement of myrights therein.On November 18, 1898, Aleister Crowley, having duly qualified himself, signedthe preliminary pledge form, to which it is requisite intending candidates formembership should subscribe their signatures. After compliance with thenecessary formalities he became a member, and thereupon ratified the obligationof his signed pledge form by a solemn obligation in open Temple of the Order.Throughout the reading, the justices smirked and sneered at the sworn testimony.Their response visibly displeased Mathers.Whately handed a copy of the pledge form up to the bench, and continued tosummarize the complaint. “The plaintiff claims the grossest possible breach ofthe defendant’s obligations and a serious infringement of the plaintiff’s rightby publishing the order’s secrets in the second Equinox under the title ‘TheTemple of Solomon the King.’ The article in question referred to the meetings ofthe Rosicrucian Order, and gave notice to the effect that the publication wouldcontinue in the March number.”At that, Justice Williams chimed in, “Is it a romance?”“I do not know, my lord. I cannot describe it.” After the laughter in thecourtroom died down, Whately continued with his summary. “The plaintiff chargesthe matter to be printed in numbers three and four would continue theinfringement.” Crowley, however, argued that Mathers was certainly not the headof the Rosicrucians, did not write the rituals, had not established any rightswith respect to the material being published, and was not entitled to aninjunction. “If there is any obligation to anybody it is to the society, andthat cannot be a legal obligation, because they are a voluntary association andare not the plaintiffs.”Williams asked Mathers’s counsel pointedly, “May I take it there is such asociety as the Rosicrucians?”“Yes,” Low replied, “there is.”“And does the society have rules?”“No, there are no rules of the society in fact, but there is a pledge ofsecrecy, which the defendant signed.” He indicated the copy of the pledge formwhich had been submitted to the bench.“I see the plaintiff says he is ‘the earthly chief’ of the order, and subject tothe guidance of the ‘spiritual’ order.”Justice Farwell interrupted the questioning to ask, “What is the ‘spiritualorder’?” The courtroom giggled in response.“I cannot go into it, my lord,” Low apologized, “but it is clear the spiritualhead would not be answerable for costs.” Laughter erupted from the observers.Justice Moulton asked to see a copy of the second Equinox, and the thick tomewas handed up to him. Low also asked the judges to read “The Pillar of Cloud,” aRosicrucian piece by Mathers. As he read, Moulton’s lips curled into a delightedsmile. The other judges similarly enjoyed Mathers’s article.“The article is simply material which Comte Macgregor obtained from old books,”Whately complained for Crowley. “He can have no copyright in such material.Moreover, if publication of the next number of The Equinox is stopped, thepublication will practically be stopped altogether, because the subscribers willbe scattered. Although the plaintiff knew all about the subject matter of hiscomplaint since November 11, he did not issue his writ until March 11, after themagazine had already been printed.”“That is a question of pounds, shillings, and pence,” Justice Williams stressed,trying to return to the legal question of infringement.“It is a very serious matter to my client.”Low interrupted, “The plaintiff waited until the eve of publication because hewas unable to locate Mr. Crowley’s address before then. Our complaint is thatwherever our ritual was got from, it was a gross breach of faith for thedefendant, after being admitted and allowed to attend the meetings—and thenbeing expelled from the order—to start publishing this matter.”“He has as much right to publish what is in the old books about the Rosicruciansas anybody else,” Justice Moulton argued.“But he is not entitled to publish a ritual ceremony which he had pledgedhimself to secrecy about, even if it was got from the Bible.”“Anybody who knows anything about these societies knows that the rituals of mostof them have been published.”“Your lordship must not ask me to admit that.”Justice Williams, trying a different approach, interceded. “I have not observedany indication that you are, either of you, Masons.” The courtroom broke intolaughter.“I don’t propose to give your lordship any, either,” Low replied, generatingeven more laughter. “This society is in no way a Masonic society.”Farwell selected several “strange and unpronounceable” words from the secondEquinox and with a smile asked Mathers what they meant. Arouerist, Onnophris,Jokam. He could not—or would not—answer. Farwell shook his head in response. “Ican understand the publication of a trade secret doing a person irreparableinjury, but I cannot see how any damage, irreparable or otherwise, could be doneby the publication in question.”“If the initiation ritual is published in the March number, as Mr. Crowleyproposes, the damage will be irreparable,” Low argued. “The cat would be out ofthe bag.”Justice Williams replied, “But so much of the cat came out of the bag inSeptember.”Farwell added, “And I think it is a dead cat.” By this time, the courtroomroiled with laughter.“Perhaps there is a second cat in the bag, my lord,” Low feebly tried tocontinue his argument. “If they have let out one, they may let out another. Ifyou cannot stop this sort of thing by an injunction, there is practically noremedy at all. The defendant has been turned out of the order, and is publishingthe article as an act of revenge for having been expelled.”In the end, the Justices ruled that Mathers had waited too long to file aninjunction: he could have done it a month or six weeks ago, before Crowley hadgone to the expense of printing The Equinox. Based on the content of the secondissue, they ruled the third issue would do the plaintiff no harm. Therefore,Mathers was not entitled to restrain the publication in question. Crowley wasallowed to publish The Equinox and was awarded costs as well.Response to the trial was overwhelming. Virtually every London newspaper sportedheadlines like “Secret Society: Amusing Comedy in Appeal Court,” “RosicrucianRites: The Dread Secrets of the Order Revealed,” “Secrets of a Mystic Society:Rosicrucian Ritual to Be Revealed,” and “Secrets of the ‘Golden Dawn’: QuaintRites of the Modern Rosicrucians.”25[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts025] Everybody knew about themagician Aleister Crowley, who was publishing the Rosicrucians’ secrets. Manypapers even excerpted rituals from the victorious Equinox.Most significantly, as the Evening News reported, “The revelations of Mr.Crowley have created utter consternation in the ranks of the Rosicrucians.”26[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts026] Crowley’s publication of therituals, however, upset far fewer than did Mathers’s claim to leadership of theRosicrucian Order. As a result, Crowley was “invaded by 333 sole and supremeGrand Masters of the Rosicrucians,”27[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts027] all of whom conferred upon himmembership in their organizations. One of these was Theodor Reuss (1855–1923),head of the German organization Ordo Templi Orientis, which Crowley would cometo embrace and direct in later years. At the time, however, he simply “booted[Reuss] with the other 332.”28 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts028]Crowley also became acquainted at this time with John Yarker (1833–1913), acollector of patents to operate various clandestine and pseudo-Masonic lodges,all of which he believed to predate the Ancient and Accepted Rite (i.e.,“legitimate” Freemasonry), or at the very least to be just as legitimate.Foremost amongst these was the Ancient and Primitive Rite of Masonry, or ofMemphis-Mizraim, which was an amalgamation of two older rites of ninety-six andninety degrees, respectively, over which Yarker was Supreme Grand MasterGeneral. Despite being embattled within and ultimately expelled from the Ancientand Accepted Rite because of his fringe interests,29[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts029] he continued to be an activeMasonic scholar, contributing regularly to Masonic publications, including theprestigious journal Ars Quatuor Coronatorum.30[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts030] Many of his ideas in thejournal, however, fell on deaf ears. It was in fact Crowley’s positive review ofYarker’s The Arcane Schools (1909) that initially prompted Yarker to contactCrowley and thus initiate correspondence with an appreciative listener.31[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts031] Yarker, as did so many othergroups, bestowed on Crowley high rank in various orders. As a result of thesedeluges of dignities, the list of honors conferred on Crowley at this timefilled four dense pages.32 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts032][images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_039_r1.jpg]Illustrious Brother John Yarker (1833–1913) in his later years.

Amongthese were G. M. Marston, Frank Bennett, J. G. Bayley, Herbert Close, and J. T.Windram.Commander Guy Montagu Marston (1871–1928) served in the Royal Navy as “one ofthe highest officials of the Admiralty.”33[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts033] He was born at Rempstone Hall,Dorset, to Rev. Charles D. Marston and Katharine Calcraft. Enlisting in theRoyal Navy, he advanced to sublieutenant in 1892, and shortly thereafter servedunder Rear-Admiral Bedford on three punitive expeditions to the Gambia (February1894), the Republic of Benin (September 1894), and Niger (February 1895). In1901, Marston succeeded his uncle, William Montagu Calcraft, at Rempstone. Thesame year, he was made a full lieutenant, and in 1905 was promoted to commander,serving with the Hydrographic Department of the Admiralty. He was a friend ofEnglish poet Rupert Brook, whom W. B. Yeats had called “the handsomest young manin England”; Brook was also a friend of Equinox contributor G. H. S. Pinsent,which may provide the connection to Crowley. Marston was an avid reader, and hislibrary reveals an interest in the sexual researches of Freud, Krafft-Ebing, andHavelock Ellis. Marston’s own experiments on the psychology of marriedEnglishwomen demonstrated—he believed conclusively—that shamanic drumming madethem restless, intensifying until it resulted in “shameless masturbation orindecent advances.”34 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts034] Hisinterest in ritual magic led him to join theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]on February 22, 1910, with the motto “All for knowledge.” On November 12, 1910,he would take command of the Blanche cruiser and leave for Devonport.35[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts035]Frank Bennett (1868–1930) was a Lancashire bricklayer who, due to personalhardships, worked with his hands since age nine. Magic and Theosophy hadinterested him for a long time, and he wrote Crowley in the winter of 1910 toask his advice on a practical course of study. Crowley recommended the Abramelinoperation, adding, “I am glad to hear that you are really at work. So manypeople now-a-days just prattle about magic, and never do any.”36[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts036] To help him along, Crowleysent him a copy of The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage.Bennett did as instructed but soon sent an alarmed letter to Crowley because hewas hearing voices in his head. Crowley wrote back, reassuring:What you report is rather good in a way, because it shows you are getting someresults. But of course it implies also that your sphere is not closed. I shoulduse the banishing Rituals of Hexagrams and Pentagrams to begin and end eachmeditation and also assumption of the God-form of Harpocrates. I think I shoulddo less reading and more gardening; and in particular I should go to a doctorand make sure that the symptoms are removed so far as they are physical.37[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts037]Here is Crowley at his best as a teacher: rule out medical problems; barringthis, work in a more controlled environment and, most importantly, don’t try toohard. The advice must have worked, as the problem did not come up again.Bennett joined theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]as “Sapienta Amor Potentia” (Love of wisdom is power) on March 12, 1910. Inorder to check on this potential student, Crowley sent his student Herbert Inmanto call on him. Inman learned that Bennett shared his interest in Co-Masonry, anew movement in Freemasonry that admitted women alongside men in its ranks. Thenature of their conversation is unknown, but shortly afterwards Inman left forRio and set up a TS lodge. Despite threat of expulsion, Bennett pursuedTheosophy instead of theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]and moved to Australia in 1911.38[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts038]James Gilbert Bayley joined theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]on March 22, 1910, taking the motto “Perfectio et Ministerium” (Perfection andservice). Although Crowley initially considered him a doubtful member, havingbeen brought in under Inman, he would stand by Crowley throughout his life,serving as his British liaison while he was out of the country in the 1920s andstaying in close touch through his final years.39[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts039]Herbert H. Close (1890–1971) was an old friend of Fuller’s, born to a well-to-dofamily of land owners. Under the pen name Meredith Starr, he was a writer andpoet interested in mysticism, aromatherapy, and homeopathy, and describedhimself as a “constructive psychologist.” He was also a contributor to TheOccult Review.40 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts040] Shortly afterjoining on June 6, 1910, Frater Superna Sequor (I follow the gods) beganexperiments with Crowley’s drug of choice, the hallucinogen Anhalonium lewinii,commonly known as peyote.41 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts041]After an astral journey convinced Close that he had attained a high grade,Crowley tested his claimed ability to stave off the effects of any drug bygiving him ten grains of calomel. A note from Crowley to Fuller sheds light onthis meeting: “I saw Starr & slew him. I hope he’ll be all right soon. I’vegiven him a week to study Kant and a fortnight to get Kunt.”42[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts042] Close’s poem “Memory of Love”appeared in The Equinox I(7), but he eventually parted with AC, most likely whenFuller did, and later briefly became a follower of Indian guru Meher Baba(1894–1969), helping bring him to the West in the early 1930s. Crowley bitterlyassessed the student: “Went out of his mind and never came back.”43[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts043]James Thomas Windram (1877–1939) was a South African accountant who joined theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]on August 11, 1910. He chose the magical name of “Servabo Fidem” (I serve thefaith), and was one of only eight students who Crowley passed to Neophyte. LikeBayley, he stuck by Crowley for many years, taking on theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]motto “Semper Paratus” (Always ready) and eventually becoming OTO National GrandMaster for South Africa under the title of Mercurius X°.On April 1, Crowley also admitted into theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]Australian violinist Leila Ida Nerissa Bathurst Waddell (1880–1932). who wouldbecome one of his most important magical partners. Leila Waddell was thedaughter of David Waddell and Ivy Lea Bathurst of Randwick, New South Wales. Shewas born in Bathurst, New South Wales, a city whose largely aboriginalpopulation was transformed by the 1851 discovery of gold and the 1876 completionof a railway from Sydney. She took violin lessons from age seven, quicklymastering her instrument. However, when her tutor died, it became clear that shewas playing by memorizing her teacher’s performance, without either readingmusic or understanding theory. So she got a new tutor and started over.44[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts044] She was trained by HenriStael, principal violinist with the Pleyel Concert Company, and in the 1898annual examinations at the Sydney College of Music she was first runner-up for amedal in advanced honors in violin.45[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts045] She began teaching in suburbanSydney: at Presbyterian Ladies’ College, a day and boarding school in thewestern suburb of Croydon, where she taught Junior Violin from 1901 to 1905; atAscham, a nondenominational girls boarding school in the eastern suburb ofEdgecliff, until March 1907; and at Kambala, an Anglican day and boarding schoolfor girls in the eastern suburb of Rose Bay.46[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts046]With the press dubbing her “a very clever violiniste,”47[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts047] she—along with a pianist,contralto, and bass—played a Grand Concert on January 21, 1904, under themanagement Walter E. Taylor. Selections included Grieg’s Sonata No. 3 in C Minor(Opus 45) and Wieniawski’s “Cappricio-Valse” in E major (Opus 7), both forviolin and piano. This latter piece she played “with great delicacy andbrilliancy, exciting prolonged applause.” After two recalls, “her virtuositybeing amply demonstrated,” “the talented young lady” returned with “Le Cygne,”the thirteenth movement of Saint-Saëns’s Carnival of Animals; the “Romance” fromWieniawski’s Violin Concerto No. 2; and Bohm’s “Papillons.”48[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts048] In August 1905, she debuted asa soloist at a Sydney Town Hall concert recital given by Arthur Mason, dubbed“one of our busiest musicians” for his jobs as City Organist, organist at St.James’ Church, and director of the Sydney Choristers.49[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts049] A 1906 concert was held tohonor the celebrated violinist’s charitable works.50[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts050] This attracted the attentionof Henry Hawayrd, who hired her for the Brescians, a group of Anglo-Italianinstrumentalists and vocalists who served as the movie-theater orchestra for T.J. West’s West Pictures in New Zealand. Works performed by Waddell at this timeincluded Charles Flavell Hayward’s “Grand Concert Duet (Olde Englande) onEnglish Airs, for Two Violins” (with Auelina Martinego) and Francesco PaoloTosti’s song “Beauty’s Eyes,” with violin accompaniment and obligato.51[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts051]Waddell played with the Brescians from 1906 to 1908, when she left for Englandto hone her craft. This is likely when she studied with world-class violinteacher Émile Sauret (1852–1920), who was teaching in England at this time;several years later, she would also study with Leopold Auer (1845–1930) in NewYork.52 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts052] Success followed her,as the Sydney Mail reported in June 1909, that “the well-known Sydney violinisthas been meeting with marked success at Bournemouth.”53[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts053] Soon she was performing aspart of the Ladies’ Orchestra in George Edwardes’s revival of Oscar Straus’s AWaltz Dream, which opened at Daly’s Theater in Leicester Square on January 17,1911. While the Times reviewer was admittedly jaded by having seen previousproductions and thus gave the show a lukewarm reception, The Play Pictorialraved.54 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts054] The show ran for 106performances through the end of April 1911.55[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts055]Part Maori, Leila Waddell had square brusque features and thick eyebrows, nose,and lips. Her straight dark hair reached down to her waist. She was slender,attractive, and exotic, and Crowley fell madly in love with her. He dubbed her“the Mother of Heaven”—often referring to her simply as “Mother”—and through herthe “purely human side of his life reached a proper climax.”56[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts056] She became one of the mostintriguing and important figures in Crowley’s life. Within a week of heracquaintance, he was inspired to write “The Vixen” and “The Violinist.” Thefirst is an occult-horror short story about an heiress who uses black magicagainst her lover. The latter belongs to the same genre, about a woman whoevokes a demon from one of the watchtowers though her music. In these pieces heportrayed Leila as happy, honest, shrewd, and huntress lithe. During a May tripto Venice, Crowley wrote The Household Gods, also dedicated to her. Penned atHôtel Pallanza in Lago Maggiore, he called it “a charming little play showinghow heaven confused a domestic quarrel between husband and wife.”57[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts057] In his Confessions, Crowleyadmitted a secret affection for this piece, and the writer Louis Wilkinsonclaimed it contained one of the funniest exclamations in literature.58[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts058][images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_040_r1.jpg]The Ladies’ Orchestra for George Edwardes’s revival of A Waltz Dream, 1911.(photo credit 9.3) [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c09-fig003a]Crowley noted that since the Mathers trial, “For the first time, I found myselffamous and my work in demand.”59[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts059] His poem about the Sahara,“The Tent,” appeared in the March 1910 Occult Review,60[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts060] followed in the May issue by along discussion of the court case.His next book was The Scented Garden. Purportedly translated from a rare Indianmanuscript by the late Major Lutiy and another, it was fully titled The ScentedGarden of Abdullah the Satirist of Shiraz. It appeared early in the year, wasprinted anonymously, and was issued privately in an edition of two hundredcopies. Written during Crowley’s Asian wanderings, it was his parody of theIranian poets and their texts on mysticism and homosexual love. It was also atribute to his hero, Sir Richard Burton, whose scholarly books on sexual customsof the near and far east had caused a moralistic stir. “The Scented Garden dealsentirely with pederasty, of which the author saw much evidence in India,”Crowley wrote of his book. “It is an attempt to understand the mind of thePersian, while the preliminary essay does the same for the English clergyman.”61[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts061] When he wrote these words in1913, most copies of the book had been seized and destroyed.In the preface to his next book, Crowley wrote “In response to a widely-spreadlack of interest in my writings, I have consented to publish a small andunrepresentative selection from the same.” This anthology was Ambergris,published by Elkin Matthews. In typical manner, Crowley ran up £6 worth of proofcorrections. He found the charges astronomical, and attacked the printer duringhis review of the book in the fourth Equinox. The investment was worthwhile,however, as the Evening Post declared it “the most interesting volume of newEnglish verse seen this year.”62[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts062] The Nation found Crowley “aspassionately possessed by his theme as any poet has ever been.63[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts063] The New Age similarly declaredthat any lack of interest was attributable to the high price of his lavisheditions, adding “Mr. Crowley is one of the principal poets now writing.”64[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts064] D. H. Lawrence (1885–1930)—hisThe White Peacock (1911) not yet published and his famous Lady Chatterley’sLover (1928) nearly two decades off—disliked the book, remarking, “If Ambergrissmells like ‘Crowley,’ it is pretty bad. Civet cats and sperm whales—ugh!”65[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts065] Ironically, Crowley andLawrence would both be underdogs of the Mandrake Press stable some twenty yearslater.The Winged Beetle collected many of Crowley’s newer works, some reprinted fromprevious works66 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts066] and othersappearing for the first time. He dedicated its poems to various people in hislife, including G. C. Jones, Euphemia Lamb, Austin Spare, Lord Salvesen, RaymondRadclyffe, Kathleen Bruce, Rose Crowley, Commander Marston, Elaine Simpson, J.F. C. Fuller, Victor Neuburg, Frank Harris, Norman Mudd, H, Sheridan-Bickers,Allan Bennett, Mary Waska, George Raffalovich, and his mother. Yielding to hispublisher’s concern that verse three of the dedication was too indelicate,Crowley consented to pen a less offensive substitute. However, the book’s“Glossary of Obscure Terms” allowed readers to translate it back to read:Yea! God himself upon his throneCringed at thy torrid truculence;Tottered and crashed, a crumbled crone,at thy contemptuous ‘slave Get hence!’Out flickered the Ghost’s marish tongue,And Jesus wallowed in his dung.It also featured a poem called “The Convert (A Hundred Years Hence),” which tooka tongue-in-cheek view of his current popularity:There met one eve in a sylvan gladeA horrible Man and a beautiful maid.“Where are you going, so meek and holy?”“I’m going to temple to worship Crowley.”“Crowley is God, then? How did you know?”“Why, it’s Captain Fuller that told us so.”Fuller also had the honor of designing the book cover and having the volume as awhole dedicated to him. It remains one of the best anthologies of Crowley’sworks, and the press received it enthusiastically. A critic with the OccultReview wrote:I declare that Aleister Crowley is among the first of living English poets. Itwill not be many years before this fact is generally recognized and dulyappreciated.… The range of his subjects is almost infinite … his poems areablaze with the white heat of ecstasy, the passionate desire of the Overmantowards his ultimate consummation, reunion with God.67[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c09-nts067]Alas, Crowley was about to learn the press was quite fickle.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_041_r1.jpg]Leila Waddell (1880–1932).

The ceremony was designed tosummon Bartzabel, spirit of Mars, and the burning of his incense, tobacco, wasintended to make the residence more conducive to his appearance. Just as Crowleyhad sat in the Triangle of the Art during the call of the Tenth Aethyr, soNeuburg now sat in the space reserved for the spirit, ready to act as itsconduit. As the ceremony proceeded, Neuburg entered a trance, rose to his feet,and to everyone’s surprise, danced an unscheduled dervish. When the dance endedand Victor began to speak as the god of war, they realized that Bartzabel wasamong them.Marston asked the obvious question: “Will nation rise up against nation?”Bartzabel, through Neuburg, warned them that two wars would break out within thenext five years. The first would center on Turkey, the second in Germany. Theconflicts would destroy both nations. (The prediction would prove to be correct,with the Balkan War in 1912 and World War I in 1914.)Although the ritual was an unqualified success—it was the most startling andconcrete magical result Crowley had known so far—its significance comes fromneither Neuburg’s channeling nor the accurate prediction. The ritual isimportant because Marston, impressed with the ceremony, half-jokingly suggestedthey charge admission and perform it publicly. Crowley’s eyes lit up, and hereplied, “I think you may be on to something.”While the spirit of Mars foretold war, a smaller battle brewed at TrinityCollege. Dean Reginald St. John Parry (1858–1935)1[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts001] received a letter claimingCrowley was a pederast and was being followed by the police (the recentpublication of AC’s homosexual Bagh-i-Muattar doubtlessly prompted the rumor).Hearing claims that police were following him, Crowley responded with a flip“Good, I shan’t be burgled.”Parry, gravely concerned about the moral character of this frequent campusvisitor, summoned Norman Mudd to his office. Mudd, aside from being a Crowleydevotee, was also secretary of the Cambridge Freethought Association, which Wardhad formed under AC’s direction to host his talks on campus. DeanParry—explaining that he objected not to Crowley’s talks but to hismorality—instructed Mudd to cancel the Freethought Association’s invitation andcease distributing copies of The Star in the West. Given that AC had just won apopular court case, Parry chose his words carefully to avoid slander.Outraged, Mudd summoned the Freethought Association’s other members, who senttheir rebellious reply to the Dean:The Association having taken into consideration the request made to it by theDean of Trinity regrets that it finds itself unable to comply with the request.It regards the right to invite down any person it thinks fit as essential to itsprinciples and wishes to point out that its attitude towards any opinionsadvocated before it is purely critical.2[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts002]Crowley, meanwhile, fumed that someone—a “Parry-lytic Liar,” as Crowley dubbedhim3 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts003]—should accuse him behindhis back: shades of Champney! So he wrote Mudd’s father, claiming his son’stutors were “indulging in things so abominable that among decent people theyhave not even a name,”4 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts004] andrecommended he place his son in the charge of more probitous tutors. Thatsummer, Crowley came to Cambridge as scheduled.Having failed to control the Freethought Association, Parry had no recourse butto single out one of them and issue an ultimatum. Indeed, Parry has beencriticized “for a certain peremptoriness and a tendency to overrideopposition.”5 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts005] The ax fell onMudd: he was to resign as secretary of the Freethought Association, write thedean a letter of apology, and promise on his honor as a gentleman never again tocontact Aleister Crowley. If he refused, Parry would cancel his scholarship.Mudd crumbled. As he later recounted, “I will not go into details as to thefight I put up. It was stubborn but unskillful and I was compelled ultimately togive in. You must understand that at this time I was quite poor, having gone upto Cambridge only with the help of scholarships.”6[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts006] That scholarship was his onlymeans of staying in college, and his parents were already hundreds of pounds indebt over his other educational expenses. Set on an academic career, he had nochoice but to comply: to resign and apologize. However, he secretly maintainedhis correspondence with Crowley.Cambridge banned Crowley, and the battle was over for now. The incident wouldprompt AC’s poetic critique “Athanasius Contra Decanum,” eventually published inThe Equinox.On an idle evening with idle guests, Crowley posed a challenge to Leila Waddell,the Mother of Heaven: he would read a poem, and ask her to play a compositionthat reflected its mood. It became a call-response, with Crowley rifling throughhis library and Leila running through her repertoire to find responses to theother’s statements. The evening turned into an artistic dialogue, with even theobservers intrigued, entertained, and excited.In the silent moments following the conversation, Crowley was spirituallycharged and uplifted. So, he learned, were his friends. It felt as though they’djust done some powerful, primal ritual. Notions from this performance and theritual at Marston’s house met and joined: Neuburg’s dance, Leila’s music, andCrowley’s poetry were all powerful adjuncts to dramatic ritual. Based on thissketchy theme, AC wrote two poems to the Mother of Heaven: “The Interpreter” and“Pan to Artemis.” Both are frenetic and infectious invocations:Uncharmable charmerOf Bacchus and MarsIn the sounding reboundingAbyss of the stars!O virgin in armour,Thine arrows unslingIn the brilliant resilientFirst rays of the spring!By the force of the fashionOf love, when I brokeThrough the shroud, through the cloud,Through the storm, through the smoke,To the mountain of passionVolcanic that woke—By the rage of the mageI invoke, I invoke!7 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts007]On August 23 these elements coalesced into the Rite of Artemis, performed at theEquinox offices for the press and public. Its name and form were more than apassing nod to the Matherses’ “Rite of Isis” in Paris a decade before.With lights dimmed, incense burning, and all clad in their magical robes, therite began with the banishing ritual of the pentagram and purifications of thetemple with water and fire. With the space duly cleared and consecrated, Crowleyled the others in a circumambulation around the altar. One brother passed theCup of Libation around the room while another recited poetry. After invokingArtemis via the Greater Ritual of the Hexagram, another libation celebrated thedeity. A third libation followed AC’s reading of “Song of Orpheus” fromArgonauts.Speculation surrounds the contents of this libation: although reporter RaymondRadclyffe described the concoction as pleasant smelling, attendee Ethel Wielandsaid it tasted like rotten apples and made her intoxicated for a week. Theliquid clearly contained some active ingredient, for Neuburg wrote to theWielands after the performance, “I am glad the effects of the drug have passedoff from Mrs. Wieland and yourself.”8[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts008] Neuburg’s biographer JeanOverton Fuller claimed the drug was opium, although Crowley himself gave thebest explanation: to generate a bacchic exuberance without intoxicating patronswith wine, he opted instead for “the elixir introduced by me toEurope”—Anhalonium lewinii or mescal buttons infused with herbs, fruit juices,and alcohol—with instructions to skip anyone who showed signs of drunkenness. Atthis time, no laws prohibited the use of such substances.Following the preliminaries, the brethren led in and enthroned on a high seatthe Mother of Heaven. Solemn and reverent, Crowley recited Swinburne’s firstchorus from “Atalanta.”9 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts009]Another libation, an invocation to Artemis, and further ceremonies followed. Therite took on a greater energy when Crowley commanded Neuburg to dance “the danceof Syrinx and Pan in honour of our lady Artemis.” Neuburg danced with beauty andgrace until he collapsed from exhaustion in the middle of the room, stayingthere for the remainder of the rite. Crowley recited another poem to Artemis,and after a deathly silence, the Mother of Heaven took her Guarnerius violin andplayed. Her performance was sensual, subtle, masterful. The stunned audience waswafted away by the very ecstasy Crowley had hoped to produce.The long, intense silence ended when Crowley announced, “By the Power in mevested I declare the Temple closed.”Raymond Radclyffe reviewed the ceremony for the August 24 edition of The Sketch,calling it “beautifully conceived and beautifully carried out. If there is anyhigher form of artistic expression than great verse and great music, I have yetto learn it.”10 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts010] Radclyffehailed from an old and distinguished family, beginning as a financial journalistand editor at St. Stepehen’s Review, where his partner, William Allison, calledhim “a singularly able man.”11 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts011]As a signatory on the paper’s parent company, Radclyffe was named in a libelsuit against St. Stephen’s Review; although protesting innocence, the lawsuitand other financial troubles doomed the paper.12[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts012] He personally sufferedfinancially, appearing in court to account for over £5,000 in unpaid debt.13[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts013] He recovered and continued towrite, contributing to London’s Financial Times and publishing his memoir,Wealth and Cats, in 1898.14 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts014]During the 1910s he would go on to be financial editor for the New Witness,regular financial commentator for The English Review, and author of The War andFinance;15 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts015] he beame soinfluential that his word could bolster how the public perceived the integrityof any new company or undertaking.16[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts016]According to AC, Radclyffe, “though utterly indifferent to Magick, waspassionately fond of poetry and thought mine first-class, and unrivalled in mygeneration.”17 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts017] Theirs was adeep friendship, Crowley writing appreciatively of him, “he was one of the verybest that ever lived; a City Editor straight as Euclid before Einstein attackedhim, and one of the best literary critics and friends in the world.”18[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts018] This explained his presence atthe Rite of Artemis, and AC appreciated the good review, inscribing a copy ofClouds without Water to “Raymond Radclyffe from his grateful friend AleisterCrowley.”19 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts019][images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_042_r1.jpg]Financial writer and editor Raymond Radclyffe, c. 1898. (photo credit 10.1)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c10-fig001a]Radclyffe’s positive review encouraged Crowley to compose and perform an entireseries of rites. Although Fuller and his friends urged Crowley to leave wellenough alone, Crowley stubbornly rented a room at Westminster’s Caxton Hall. Tothis respectable venue accustomed to whist drives, subscription dances, andmeetings of the fledgling suffragettes, Crowley planned to introduce incense,music, chanting, and dancing for the ritual of all rituals.As theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]geared up for a new issue of The Equinox and its forthcoming engagement atCaxton Hall, several new faces entered the picture that summer.Ethel Archer, an aspiring poet in her early twenties, came aboard early enoughto attend the Rite of Artemis. Ethel Florence E. Archer (b. 1885) was the fourthof five children, born in Slougham, Sussex, to Ormond A. Archer, curate ofWhitbourne, and his wife, Emily.20[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts020] Although she had written TheBook of Plain Cooking,21 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts021] shesought creative outlets through fiction and poetry. In 1908 she married artistEugene John Wieland (c. 1880–1915), son of Thomas Thatcher and Eugenie Wielandof Sunnyfield House, Guisborough, Yorkshire;22[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts022] she nicknamed him “Bunco.”They were passionate lovers, as anonymously documented in a popular articlewritten by a neighbor who watched their unselfconscious behavior through theopen window of their “shabby old garret,” which was furnished with little morethan an easel, two chairs, and a mirror.23[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts023] Both Ethel and Eugene becameheavily involved with both OTO andA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]at this time, and Crowley would encourage Eugene to set up the publishingimprint Wieland & Co., which over the next couple of years would bring outsubsequent issues of The Equinox, and several of Crowley’s other works.24[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts024] Archer’s contributions to TheEquinox were limited to love poems, and Neuburg, noting that these addressedwomen, teasingly dubbed her Sappho; meanwhile, she was surprised that someone asfey as Neuburg would point the finger. Although she explained to everybody’ssatisfaction that her poems described how she imagined a man might see her, shenevertheless adopted Sappho as her colorful moniker. Both Neuburg and Crowleyintrigued her, and she spent long hours at the Equinox offices. Both she andWieland would eventually part with Crowley, and Wieland would go on to servewith the 19th Battalion in the Great War, reaching the rank of sergeant. Hewould die in a Canadian hospital on October 5, 1915, as a result of injuriessustained at Loos, and be buried at Le Treport Military Cemetery.25[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts025] Archer would continue topublish occasional books, poetry, and essays throughout her life.26[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts026]As one of Chelsea’s great hostesses, Elizabeth Gwendolen Otter (1876–1958)27[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts027] considered herselfunshockable. Her Sunday luncheons attracted all manner of actors, painters, andwriters; she even took in her fair share of them. A friend introduced her toCrowley because of her fascination with the odd and unconventional. AC was anadmirable addition to her collection of personalities, and the magician becamegood friends with this plain-looking woman who claimed descent from Pocahontas.She contributed her opinions to the book review section of The Equinox,28[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts028] while he in turn dedicated“The Ghouls”29 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts029] to her andportrayed her in Moonchild (1929) as Mrs. Badger.Vittoria Cremers could have been a storybook figure: she was born VittoriaCassini around 1859 in Pisa to the Italian Manrico Vittorio Cassini and hisBritish wife, Elizabeth Rutherford. Vittoria made her way to New York, where shewas proprietor and editor of the Stage Gazette. Around February 1886 she marriedRussia’s Baron Louis Cremers, who was the son of a famous St. Petersburg bankingfamily, the Rothschilds, with a net worth of $40 million. A couple of weeksafter the wedding, she reportedly told her husband that she “could not possiblylove any man.”30 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts030] It was atthis time that he learned of her habit of going out on the town dressed as aman, and Crowley later reports that “She boasted of her virginity and of theintimacy of her relations with Mabel Collins, with whom she lived a longtime.”31 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts031] The Baron and Cremerssoon separated, then divorced; Vittoria got a butch haircut and began answeringsimply to “Cremers.” Mabel Collins (1851–1927) was a Theosophist and novelistwhose novel The Blossom and the Fruit (1890) Crowley admired enough to includein theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]reading list; he considered it “the best existing account of the Theosophictheories presented in dramatic form.”32[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts032] While Collins and Crowleynever met, their mutual acquaintance Cremers doubtlessly saw parallels: Just asCrowley was editor of The Equinox, Collins was H. P. Blavatsky’s coeditor of theTheosophical periodical Lucifer. And just as Crowley claimed to scribe various“Holy Books” dictated by the Secret Chiefs, so too did Collins claim that herbooks Idyll of the White Lotus (1884), Light on the Path (1885), and Through theGates of Gold (1887) were dictated by Koot Hoomi, one of the Masters or Mahatmaswho guided Blavatsky.33 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts033]Cremers often repeated Collins’s claim to know the identity of Jack the Ripper,and Crowley preserved the claim in “Jack the Ripper.”34[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts034]Cremers was a sincere but penniless seeker, transcribing 777 in New York’s AstorLibrary because she could not afford to purchase a copy. She wished to help “putthe Order over,” as Crowley called it, so AC paid her passage to England andintroduced her to his circle. Aged in her fifties, she had white hair andunhappy eyes. Her stern, square face, yellow and hard, reminded Crowley ofwrinkled parchment. When she boasted of her undercover work against New York’sdrug and prostitution rings, Crowley could more readily believe that shedirected drug and prostitution traffic than fought it. “Crowley is one of threethings,” she once said of her mentor. “He is either mad, or he is a blackguard,or he is the greatest adept.”35[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts035]Crowley also got to know W. E. Hayter Preston (b. 1891), a close friend of theNeuburg family, who acted as Victor’s watchdog. Like Victor, he was aFreethinker and poet. Although he worked as a freelance journalist, he soonbecame literary editor at the Sunday Referee. Preston, who studied Lévi and theFrench magicians before he ever met Neuburg, took a dim view of Crowley. Adinner with AC and his mother helped solidify this opinion: according toPreston, Crowley snatched the menu out of his mother’s hands and, closing it,told her, “Mother, you may have boiled toads. Or fried Jesu.”36[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts036]Jeanne Eugenie Heyse (1890–1912) was a young actress and dancer at the RoyalAcademy of Dramatic Art, her tuition paid by a local businessman. She was theoldest of three sisters, born in Edmonton, Middlesex, to Holland-born wholesalemerchant Ferdinand Francis E. Heyse and his Irish wife, Margaret.37[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts037] Under her stage name Ione deForest, her major previous experience was playing The Blue Bird (1909) byBelgian playwright and winner of the 1911 Nobel Prize for Literature MauriceMaeterlinck (1862–1949). Joan, as she preferred to be called, had no interest inthe occult, but she entered Crowley’s circle when she answered an ad in Stageseeking dancers for a performance at Caxton Hall. Her body was as gaunt andcadaverous, and the pale powders she wore made her anemic skin even more pallid.Black hair dangled to her slight waist, and golden eyes beamed vacantly from heroval face. Beautiful and sweet, she could be manic one moment, melancholic thenext. Indeed, two years later her newlywed husband would describe her: “She wasin poor health, highly strung, and occasionally suffered from hysteria.”38[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts038] Although considered a woodenand untalented dancer by some, her lover, American expatriate modernist poetEzra Pound (1885–1972), offered the following portrait in his “Dance Figure”:Dark-eyed,O woman of my dreams,Ivory sandalled,There is none like thee among the dancers,None with swift feet.39 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts039]This tragic doll of a woman appealed to both AC and Neuburg, and she got thejob.With Leila, Ethel, Gwen, Joan, and Vittoria always around, these students becameknown as “the Harem.” Crowley would work hard at his desk—on another issue ofThe Equinox or one of his students’ books, such as The History of a Soul and TheDeuce and All by Raffalovich, The Whirlpool by Archer, or The Triumph of Pan byNeuburg—while Joan stood behind him, running her fingers through his hair andcalling him “Aleister,” even though everybody referred to him as AC. Except forthe Mother of Heaven: with her accent, it sounded like “IC.” Her speechinvariably prompted Crowley to declare, “Oh, Mother, I do wish you’d lose thataccent. It sounds so bad in the Rites!” Although said in jest, it prompted Leilato ask Gwen for help with her dialect: “Will you tell me when I sy anything inAustreyelian?”40 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts040]Occasionally the Vickybird, as Neuburg was dubbed, would look up from his deskand make some offhand pun about Archer’s sapphic tendencies, excusing himselfwith “If you’ll pardon the ostroloboguosity.” No week passed without Victorusing this, his favorite word. Having had his say, he would return to business,reading page proofs or tossing coal onto the fire with his fingers. Bothactivities kept his fingers blackened, and when things got slow, Crowley wouldmarch over to his desk and paternally demand, “Victor, let me see your fingers.”In response, Neuburg would adopt a childlike posture, hiding his hands behindhis back and replying, “Shan’t.”And, when Neuburg commented how lucky Otter was to know Crowley as long as shehad without being hurt, she shot back, “How could he hurt me? I’m not in lovewith him, and I’ve never lent him money.”The fourth Equinox appeared that September, with its usual selection of fiction,poetry, and magic. Regarding Mathers v. Crowley, the editorial claimed “Mathershas run away too—without paying our costs.” And, as prophetically as theclipping in the last issue, Crowley wrote, “I restrict my remarks; there may besome more fun coming.”41 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts041]“We are the Greeks! and to us the rites of Eleusis should open the doors ofHeaven.” So read the artsy brochure, its gray cover stamped with a blackswastika, issued at the end of September to promote the Rites of Eleusis. Itdescribed their goal simply:In order to induce religious ecstasy in its highest form Crowley proposes tohold a series of religious services; seven in number will be conducted byAleister Crowley himself, assisted by other Neophytes of theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg],the mystical society, one of whose Mahatmas is responsible for the foundation ofTHE EQUINOX.42 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts042]The seven rituals, one for each of the planets in traditional astrology, wouldoccur on consecutive Wednesdays from October 19 to November 30, 1910, at CaxtonHall. The doors would open at 8:30 and lock promptly at 9 o’clock, when therites began. They would run for one and a half to two and a half hours.Attendees were encouraged to wear colors appropriate to the evening’sperformance: black for Saturn, dark blue for Jupiter, red for Mars, and so on.One reporter complained that the rites “proscribe colours which are not in mywardrobe, although a few might be met by the choice of one of those ties whichlie unworn at the back of every man’s chest of drawers.”43[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts043] Admission to the entire seriescost a hefty £5 5s., and only one hundred tickets were for sale.Although the price of admission was high—about $200 by today’s standards—Crowleyurged Probationers to attend in their robes and assist in the ceremonies. Healso sent a complimentary ticket to H. G. Wells,44[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts044] but there is no record of hisattendance. Regardless, spectators packed Caxton Hall for the debut. Fuller evenbrought his mother.All the participants—Crowley, Waddell, Raffalovich, Ward, Neuburg, andHayes—were nervous because they had never rehearsed the rituals all together.Nevertheless, when they began by the dim glow of candles and colored lights, therites came together. They explored and described the metaphysical aspects of theplanets as magic and myth understood them. Dance, music, and poetry (mostlyCrowley’s own) dressed up the ceremonial formalities.Leila played from her violin repertoire, featuring numerous selections by theflamboyant Polish virtuoso Henryk Wieniawski (1835–1880). Her selections alsoincluded technically demanding works such as Paganini’s “Witches’ Dance,” Bach’s“Aria for G String,” and a polonaise by Vieuxtemps. The remaining pieces wereromances and other popular salon music by Beethoven, Brahms, Mendelssohn,Schumann, Tchaikovsky, Saint-Saëns, and Wagner. She even salted a few originalcompositions among the classics.The Rites of Eleusis generated considerable interest in the press, theWashington Post reporting, “Meetings of the Rosicrucians for the purpose ofconjuration and of invoking ‘forbidden knowledge’ have been secret until lastweek. Then the Eleusinian rites were performed openly in a London hall.”45[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts045] However, reviewers widelypanned the first performance—a grim portrayal of death and darkness—aseverything from innocuous eccentricity to blasphemy. The Hawera and NormanbyStar (New Zealand) reported:An atmosphere heavily charged with incense, some cheap stage effects, aninfinity of poor reciting of good poetry, and some violin playing and dancingare the ingredients of the rite.… Positively the only relief in a drearyperformance was afforded by a neophyte falling off his stool, which caused mildhilarity among a bored and uncomfortable audience.46[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts046]The New York Times wrote, “the hall was so dark that one might well call theRites of Eleusis elusive.”47 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts047]Closer to home, A Morning Leader reviewer warned, “Unless a more cheerful toneis imparted … the people who have paid five guineas for the whole lot will havecommitted suicide before they reach Luna.”The Penny Illustrated Paper, however, articulated the fears of a staid andconservative society about Crowley:There always has been about his writings and preachings an atmosphere of strangeperfume, as if he was swaying a censer before the altar of some heathen goddess.Not having been initiated, we cannot tell but Mr. Crowley’s Eleusinian rites dosuggest an elusive form of Phallicism or sex worship.…Unfortunately, this Eleusis business is not new. It has been done in Paris,entitled the Black Mass, on several occasions.Far be it from us to suggest that the large-footed gentlemen from New ScotlandYard should visit Mr. Crowley’s little act … but the idea undermining the wholebusiness is not healthy.48 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts048]By the second rite, the yellow press attacked. The Looking Glass ran “An AmazingSect” on October 29; a cruel critique of the rites, it described the adepts’robes as Turkish bath costumes and explained how the Mother of Heaven attemptedacrobatics or jujitsu while standing on Crowley’s chest. John Bull entered thefray on November 5 with its own attack. Not to be outdone, the Looking Glassfollowed with “An Amazing Sect—No. 2” which pried luridly into Crowley’s shadowypast, printing misinformation about him such as his years as an art student, hismirror-covered temple in Boleskine, and his pseudonym Count Skerrett.49[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts049]The attacks outraged Crowley’s circle, whose members urged him to sue. Unwillingto defend his lifestyle to a middle-class Edwardian jury, AC, much to hisfriends’ consternation, offered various excuses. “Suffer any wrong that may bedone to you rather than seek redress at law,” he would say on one occasion. Onanother, he would quote a friend of his in city journalism (Radclyffe), whoadvised, “AC, let the fellow alone! If you touch pitch, you’ll be defiled.”Sometimes he didn’t want to stoop to his opponents’ level by acknowledging theattacks. Other times, he heard the Looking Glass was in financial straits andcould pay no damages. Or he was running out of money himself and couldn’t affordto sue. And there were always the vague “mystical reasons.” To defuse thesituation, AC published a statement in two articles in the Bystander. “OnBlasphemy in General and the Rites of Eleusis in Particular” appeared the thirdweek of November, defending himself against accusations leveled by the press.The autobiographical “My Wanderings in Search of the Absolute” followed,clarifying accounts of his past. Finally, he planned to publish the Rites in thesixth Equinox for the public to judge for themselves.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_043_r1.jpg]Newspaper photos of the Rite of Saturn (above) and the Rite of Jupiter (below).(photo credit 10.2) [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c10-fig002a][images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_044_r1.jpg]Coverage from The Bystander. (photo credit 10.3)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c10-fig003a]John Bull contended that AC missed the point: at issue was not freedom ofthought and expression but whether so notorious a person as he could espousewholesome doctrines, and whether “young girls and married women should beallowed to go [to him] for ‘comfort’ and ‘meditation.’ ”50[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts050] A third “Amazing Sect”installment followed in the November 26 Looking Glass. As sensational andinaccurate as its predecessors, it extended its attack to Crowley’s friends. Asection titled “By Their Friends Ye Shall Know Them” claimed:Two of Crowley’s friends and introducers are still associated with him; one, therascally sham Buddhist monk, Allan Bennett, whose imposture was shown up in“Truth” some years ago; the other a person of the name of George Cecil Jones,who was for some time employed at Basingstoke in metallurgy, but of late has hadsome sort of small merchant’s business in the City. Crowley and Bennett livedtogether, and there were rumours of unmentionable immoralities which werecarried on under their roof.51 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts051]Unlike Crowley, Jones contacted his solicitor, who wrote the publisher to demanda retraction and damages. The retraction appeared in the next issue, announcingthat Jones was no longer associated with Crowley and congratulating him forbreaking off with so disreputable a man. The paper felt no damage had been done,but offered him £5 for his trouble. The gesture insulted Jones, and he broughtthe matter to court.Four days after this inflammatory passage appeared, the seventh and final rite,of Luna, closed the series at Caxton Hall. Coming full circle, it derived fromthe Rite of Artemis that started it all. Overall, the Rites were a theatricallandmark, anticipating by fifty years the experimental theater of the 1960s and1970s.52 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts052] The Rites’ firstappreciation in academic writing on theater appeared in the 1975 article“Aleister Crowley’s Rites of Eleusis.” In it, Brown points out how innovativeCrowley was in attempting to use theater’s sensory possibilities to alterconsciousness.53 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts053] Tupman’s 2003dissertation argues that “Crowley’s Rites were not merely a unique event withneither precedent nor subsequent influence.” Indeed, despite the fact that theyare overlooked in every major Symbolist or avant-garde study, “the Rites are aclassic example of Symbolist theatre,” and were simultaneously forward-looking:to include the audience as a part of the production foreshadowed the later workof theatre anthropologists and theorists such as Richard Schechner, and servesto illustrate one of the first attempts in the twentieth century to consciouslycreate a psychological connection between theatrical and religious practicewithin the western hegemonic society.54[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts054]Lingan’s survey of the theater in New Religious Movements also recognized TheRites of Eleusis as an example of Symbolist theater.55[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts055]Nevertheless, Crowley reflected on the event with disappointment: “I throwmyself no bouquets about these Rites of Eleusis. I should have given more weeksto their preparation than I did minutes.”56[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts056] Subscriptions barely coveredcosts, and the bad press caused attendance to dwindle so much that he had tosell tickets to individual performances. Rather than draw flocks of recruits totheA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg],it drove away members and alienated its cofounders.Fuller, fearing his name would surface in the papers next, refused to risk hismilitary career by contributing to The Equinox, and began to distance himselffrom Crowley. His decision would prove prescient, as a quarter century later theImperial Fascist League’s paper, The Fascist, would dig into Fuller’s past andrun the headline: “Amazing Exposures of Mosley’s Lieutenant: General FullerInitiated into Aleister Crowley’s (Beast 666) Occult Group.”57[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts057] Fuller was outraged: duringtheir association, Crowley was no more than a little erratic, and the“notorious” exploits of Crowley that The Fascist described occurred after they’dparted ways. Fuller instructed his solicitor to prepare a writ for libel. Whilethe publisher, Arnold Spencer Leese, maintains that the writ was dropped because“I had so much ammunition concerning him,”58[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts058] the real reason was simple:upon reviewing Crowley’s more objectionable publications from 1907 to 1910,Fuller’s solicitor advised against the lawsuit. If The Fascist continued itsattacks, he reasoned, they could pursue a criminal, rather than civil, suit.59[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts059] However, the headline did nothave traction, and the subject matter quickly faded from sight.Jones was even more displeased. He counted on Crowley’s support in his suitagainst the Looking Glass. Instead, AC placed Archer and her husband in chargeof The Equinox and returned to Algiers with Neuburg for new Enochian workings.The disgruntled Jones wrote to Fuller, “Crowley goes to Algeria tomorrow. Someof his friends will say he ran away.” So too did his enemies. Crowley’s quietdeparture signaled a victory for the tabloids, which proudly announced:We understand that Mr. Aleister Crowley has left London for Russia. This shoulddo much to mitigate the rigour of the St. Petersburg winter. We have tocongratulate ourselves on having temporarily extinguished one of the mostblasphemous and cold-blooded villains of modern times.60[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts060]While waiting in Marseilles for his boat on December 9, 1910, Crowley wrote thefifth installment of “Temple of Solomon the King” himself to show Fuller that hewas expendable. It was an essay on the practical kabbalah. Although Crowleyclaims to have written it all from memory, it has the feel of several shorteressays concatenated into a long article.Crowley and Neuburg motored from Algiers to Bou-Sâada, then advanced with theirinterpreter, Mohammed ibn Rahman, on the 15th, trekking farther into the desertthan on their last visit. Southeast of Ain Rich, despite the proverb “it neverrains south of Sidi Aissa,” a torrential rainstorm caught and drenched them andtheir tents. Their guide refused to continue, so Crowley and Neuburg continuedalone into the rain. When the rain let up on the third day, they attempted topick up where their Enochian work left off: having scried into the thirtyAethyrs, they wished to continue with visions for the eighteen Keys (another setof conjurations in Dee’s system). At the moment they began, however, Neuburgbecame ill, and they had to abandon the working. Crowley returned to London toconduct business, leaving Neuburg in Biskra to recuperate, feeling like Roseabandoned in China.Crowley journeyed home with a fresh crop of ideas in his notebook, most of theminspired by desire for Leila Waddell. While still in Algiers, he wrote “On theEdge of the Desert,” “Return,” and “Prayer at Sunset.”61[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts061] As he sailed, he finished “TheScorpion,”62 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts062] a tragedy basedon the 30th degree of Freemasonry; although it reflected Crowley’s idea toreformulate the Masonic rituals (as he would eventually do with OTO),Agatha—Leila’sA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]motto—was one of its dedicatees. He also wrote “The Pilgrim”63[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts063] for her and, during a layoverin Paris’s Pantheon Tavern, penned “The Ordeal of Ida Pendragon,”64[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts064] a short story whose titlecharacter combines traits of Leila Waddell, Kathleen Bruce, and a newacquaintance, Jane Chéron; hence the dedication “To I, J, and K,” i.e., I = Ida(Leila’s second name), J = Jane, and K = Kathleen.During a layover in France, Crowley met Jane Chéron. Despite a French name, herfeatures suggested Egyptian extraction. She was “a devotee of that great andterrible God” opium. Haidée Lamoureaux, The Diary of a Drug Fiend’s heroinheroine, was based on her:[She] was a brilliant brunette with a flashing smile and eyes with pupils likepin-points. She was a mass of charming contradictions. The nose and mouthsuggested more than a trace of Semitic blood, but the wedge-shaped contour ofher face betokened some very opposite strain.… Though her hair was luxuriant,the eyebrows were almost non-existent.… Her hands were deathly thin. There wassomething obscene in the crookedness of her fingers, which were covered withenormous rings of sapphires and diamonds.65[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts065]She would also make a cameo in Moonchild, when the narrator spends a Parisevening smoking opium with her. Although she had no interest in the occult,Chéron became Crowley’s mistress at odd intervals over the next sixteen years.Alas, while her “opium soul” inspired Crowley to write, her weakness meant yearsof addiction for her.When Crowley finally reached Eastbourne, an expected cable from Leila did notarrive, so he wrote “The Electric Silence,”66[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts066] a summary of his career; “TheEarth,”67 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts067] a short essay aboutLeila; and “Snowstorm,” a three-act play in which Leila, as the lead characterNerissa, expresses her lines through violin solos. Despite the disappointment ofthe cable, his love for Leila burned strong.Finally reaching his London offices, Crowley was displeased with progress on thefifth Equinox. In addition, Raffalovich had assumed leadership during AC’sabsence, endorsing and cashing checks made out to Crowley and altering thecontent of advertisements. Reading the advertisement for 777 that incorrectlystated that less than one hundred copies remained for sale and that the pricewould soon rise to one guinea, AC was so furious that he forced Raffalovich topurchase enough copies of the book to reduce the stock to ninety. Afterward, thepupil broke off relations with Crowley. Raffalovich would go on to write TheHistory of a Soul (1911), Hearts Adrift (1912), and The Ukraine (1914) andcontribute to various magazines including the British Review, Vanity Fair, andNew Age. In 1915 he would emigrate to the United States and work as a lecturerin French. From there, he lived in Italy for five years during the fascistregime as correspondent for British and American newspapers like the New YorkTimes and Chicago Tribune.68 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts068]This also gave him the opportunity to write Mussolini’s biography.69[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts069] With a doctorate from theUkrainian University in Prague, he would become professor of French andinternational politics, and French and Slavic history; in this capacity, hewould serve on the faculties of Harvard, Dartmouth, and Emory. Dying in NewOrleans in 1958 at age seventy-seven, he would leave five children and sevengrandchildren.70 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts070]Despite these setbacks, the fifth Equinox appeared as scheduled in March 1911.To meet costs, its price increased from five to six shillings while its lengthdecreased. Nevertheless, the magazine contained its usual rich variety. Inaddition to Crowley’s poems and essays, it also featured “The Training of theMind” by Ananda Metteya (Allan Bennett),71[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts071] “A Nocturne” by Neuburg, “TheVampire” by Ethel Archer, and as a special supplement, the record of Crowley andNeuburg’s Enochian vision quest, “The Vision and the Voice.”His next book, The World’s Tragedy (1910), also appeared around this time.Bearing the notice “Privately printed for circulation in free countries: Copiesmust not be imported into England or America,” the book is another swipe atconvention. The text is an indictment of Christianity and its morals, while thepreface provides an autobiographical sketch of AC’s Brethren upbringing. PagesXXVII and XXVIII of the preface—an unusual defense of sodomy that containedscandalous accusations about the morals of cabinet members and others in highpower—were removed from all copies but those in the hands of his friends.Crowley, as usual, considered it his best work.72[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts072]Finally, the April issue of the Occult Review carried Crowley’s essay, “TheCamel: A Discussion of the Value of ‘Interior Certainty.’ ”73[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts073]On April 26, 1911, Jones v. The Looking Glass Publishing Company Ltd. et al.74[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts074] appeared before Lord JusticeScrutton of the King’s Bench Division and a common jury. The suit sought damagesfor an alleged libel in the November 26, 1910, issue of the Looking Glass.Harold Simmons, instructed by Bullock and Co., represented Jones. For thedefense, Mr. Schiller represented the publisher while West de Wend Fenton (theeditor) represented himself, and Mr. Rowlands appeared for the printer.Crowley sat in the courtroom, amused that neither side planned to call for histestimony. Fenton, he knew, was afraid of being exposed. Jones, meanwhile, hebelieved, feared what the notorious AC might say on the stand. To Fuller,however, Jones explained, “If, as my friend, he hasn’t the decency to comeforward willingly, it would be an insult to myself had I compelled him to doso.”75 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts075]The case opened with Simmons, for Jones, summarizing the charges, stating thatthe Looking Glass printed so serious a libel about Jones “that if a tithe of itwere true, my client was unfit to associate with human beings.” Because of hisfriendship with AC, he was linked to Crowley’s rumored immoralities. As aprofessional with a family to support, such statements were very damaging.The proceedings were indeed unusual: although Jones and his past were brieflydiscussed—including his membership in the GD and his trusteeship on behalf of ACand Lola Zaza—the case quickly became a trial of Crowley’s morality. While AC’sfailure to file suit with the Looking Glass was considered telling, the mostdamning evidence came from Crowley’s own published works. Presented as evidencewas “Ambrosii Magi Hortus Rosarum” from the collected Works. Schiller had markedseveral of the Latin marginal notes: “Quid Umbratur In Mari.” “Adest RosaSecreta Eros.” “Terrae Ultor Anima Terrae.” “Femina Rapta Inspirat Gaudium.”“Puella Urget Sophiam Sodalibus.” “Culpa Urbium Nota Terrae.” “Pater IubetScientiam Scribe.” The words formed by their initials—quim, arse, tuat (twat),and so on—were Crowleyan mischief that none of his associates had discovered upto that point.Despite objections from Jones’s counsel that Crowley’s writings were irrelevantto the question of Jones’s character, the defense revolved around a simplepremise: the Looking Glass did nothing more than say Jones was an associate ofCrowley. Any libelous meaning coming from such a statement was due to Crowley’snotoriously evil character and not anything written by the paper.Next was the subject of Allan Bennett recently being attacked in the paperTruth, and his failure—like Crowley—to file suit. The fact that Bennett, as amonk, had no possessions and was living five thousand miles away didn’t seem tomatter. Nor did Bennett’s medicinal use of drugs help matters. In the end, thelegal inaction of Crowley and Bennett was seen as admission of guilt.Finally, Schiller introduced surprise witnesses for the defense: Mathers, thewizened patriarch of the GD, was introduced to the court as Mr. Samuel SidneyLiddell MacGregor, ready to return the favor to Crowley for his defeat in court.The other was Mathers loyalist Dr. Berridge. Mathers fielded questions about thesecret Rosicrucian Order, Crowley’s expulsion from the GD, previous incarnationsand various pseudonyms attributed to either him or Crowley, and other mysticaltraditions. At one point, Justice Scrutton interjected, “This trial is gettingvery much like the trial in Alice in Wonderland.” Berridge, meanwhile, recountedthe rumors of “unnatural vice” that had circulated about Crowley during his GDyears.Fuller was the only witness called in Jones’s defense and could do little toundo the damage done by the previous testimony. The court transcript—while aninteresting read—is too extensive to reproduce here.76[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts076] Schiller’s closing comments tothe jury, however, captures its gist:You have heard from Dr. Berridge the type of man Aleister Crowley is.Confessedly Crowley stands as a man about whom no words of condemnation can bestrong enough. That is the man of whose friendship Captain Fuller is proud; thatis the man whose associate Mr. Jones is. I submit I have proved to you up to thehilt both by his writing and his own confessions that Crowley is a man ofnotoriously evil character. If that be so, gentlemen, I have discharged thechief burden on my shoulders, and it only remains for you to say whether I havegone beyond the bounds of fair comment.Gentlemen, was not the paper justified in showing up this amazing sect ofCrowley’s and were not they right in saying and fully justified in the commentthey made about Mr. Jones’s association with Aleister Crowley? Though he knewthese rumours were flying about, rumours which Crowley did not dare to deny, hestill associated with Crowley and would have you believe that he is a man ofperfectly unblemished character, a man whom he would not hesitate to introduceto his own wife. If a man values his own reputation so cheaply that he does notmind associating with that kind of creature, he must not complain if comment ismade about it and he must not come to you and ask you to give him exemplarydamages. When he can associate with a creature of Aleister Crowley’s descriptionand can come here and be proud of it, and to corroborate him, call a friend whois proud of the friendship of a man who writes the kind of stuff you have seen,a man who does not hesitate to advertise his pernicious literature of a grosstype by appealing to the worst instincts of degenerates amongst mankind, byappealing to their sense of the morbid, a man who himself publishes thecriticisms of his books in order to attract purchasers for his wretched books,books that have been criticized in a well-known publication of one of the twoleading universities as dealing with a revolting subject revoltingly handled,and who advertises the whole thing under the hypocritical guise of a society forthe propagation of religious truth—what are you to say of a man who boasts ofhis associations with such a creature?I ask you to say as twelve healthy-minded men that there is no comment strongenough which a paper is not entitled to make in criticizing the conduct of a manlike the plaintiff in this case. It serves him right if he meets with strongcriticism under such circumstances. Were we not justified in saying that youmust judge this man’s character by his association with this creature?Gentlemen, I ask you to say, and I ask you with confidence to say, that I havenot and that I was amply justified in making the comment I did make, that it wasa fair and proper comment to make under the circumstances, and I ask youtherefore to give a verdict for my clients.Scrutton posed four questions to the jury: 1. Were the words complained ofdefamatory of the plaintiff? 2. If so, were the defamatory statements of factsubstantially true? 3. Were the defamatory statements so far as they consistedof opinion fair comment on facts? 4. What damage has the publication caused theplaintiff? After thirty-two minutes of deliberation, the jury returned itsverdict. They answered the first three questions “Yes,” and the last “None.” Inessence, the statements and their unsavory implications were accurate and faircomment on a friend of Crowley’s, and Jones thereby suffered no damages. Theyentered judgment for the defendants. The Looking Glass had won.Jones’s defeat unleashed a new wave of gossip about the notoriously evilAleister Crowley. When American art patron and book collector John Quinn(1870–1924) visited publisher Elkin Matthews at this time, the subject ofCrowley inevitably came up. Matthews had published Ambergris, and told Quinn,“We had a very ’ard time getting him to cut things out of it. Right now,Crowley’s out of England because of something he’s done.” “What was thetrouble?” Quinn asked.“We don’t know, sir, only he has got himself dreadfully talked about.”77[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts077]The worst ramifications, however, were personal. Because Crowley offered noassistance, Jones ended their friendship. Although he would continue to overseeLola Zaza’s trust for decades, he maintained distance from Crowley. He wouldretire in 1939 because of wartime restrictions on trade; his planning wouldprove insightful, as an air raid would destroy his lab in 1941.Fuller, whom Crowley considered his best friend, sent his last letter ever toCrowley on May 2. He thought Crowley a coward for not defending himself andbroke with him on the same grounds as Jones. Fuller would go on to attain therank of major-general and invent the blitzkrieg, which England would disregardand Germany would adopt. He would be the only Englishman invited to Hitler’sbirthday party in 1939. Throughout the years, however, his interest in magicwould never fade: he would write books like Yoga (1925) and Secret Wisdom of theQabalah (1937), and contribute articles to journals like Form and the OccultReview.78 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts078] Even in his lastdays, Fuller maintained that Crowley was one of England’s greatest lyricpoets.79 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts079]At this time, Ward also became disillusioned with theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg].He not only doubted Crowley’s honesty and character but also grew weary andcritical of magic. Feeling a need to break away, he welcomed the opportunity tobecome professor of mathematics and physics at Rangoon College, where he wouldstudy Buddhism. His thoughts on the subject remained remarkably close toCrowley’s: “Properly speaking, the ‘theory’ is philosophy, the ‘practice’ isscience; and both together are religion,” he would say. In the end, he wouldbecome a Christian Scientist.Thus, in very short order, Crowley lost two of his oldest friends and, with Wardand Raffalovich, two of his best students. Two-thirds of the founding triad oftheA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]had seceded, leaving him, like Mathers, sole authority of his occultorganization, and bad press causedA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]enrollment to dwindle to only three applicants for the year 1911.The Secret Chiefs were testing him, he decided, and help would soon be on itsway.The evening was dark, and seven poplars near the Vanne Rouge Inn looked the likevigilant spirits of God. Standing at the weir, Crowley felt an emptiness as ifthe dark current of the Loing had swept away his life’s work. Not even hisnostalgia for weirs staved off the pain he felt from having friends and studentsleave him, of having his work attacked, of having the order suffer. When heneeded her most, Leila was off playing in the English Ladies’ Orchestra in AWaltz Dream.A lone star shone overhead, the moon set behind a tower, and he thought, I amalone in the Abyss. It felt as if he were again experiencing that soul-crushingordeal. Crowley returned to his room and wrote “The Sevenfold Sacrament,”80[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts080] a pendant to “Aha!” describingthat evening’s Abyss reprise.Adversity, however, always inspired Crowley; this time, he entered an annummirabilis. With Fuller gone, Crowley prepared to fill The Equinox with his ownworks, writing feverishly throughout his stay in Paris and Montigny-sur-Loing.The English Review’s June publication of “On the Edge of the Desert” served asthe starting gun for his marathon.On August 10, spending Leila’s birthday separated from his love, Crowley dweltall night on their year together. “A Birthday” resulted, recalling theirmeeting, her last birthday, the Rites of Eleusis, a tentative parting andreunion, their arrival in Paris. On their present separation, he wrote:Do not then dream this night has been a loss!All night I have hung, a god, upon the cross;All night I have offered incense at the shrine;All night you have been unutterably mine …Crowley wrote many other pieces at this time, including two short stories: “TheWoodcutter,” about a man with a one-track mind, and “His Secret Sin,” aboutsexual hypocrisy. Mortadello,81[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts081] his five-act play of Venice,also came out of this period. Rhythm gave it a decidedly mixed review, callingita dull, stupid, dreary affair. The stale situations, the childish “comedy,” andthe peurile grossness, are incredibly school-boyish; though the verse in whichthe play is written is damnably accomplished. Mr. Crowley manipulates his mediumwith a deadly dexterity. He works the Alexandrine for all it is worth; and getsunexpected amusement out of it by the skillful surprise of unexpected internalrhymes. He is a master of metrical artifice.82[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts082]Nevertheless, Mortadello would remain one of his favorite pieces, which he wouldtry throughout his life to produce on the stage.He got the idea for his play “Adonis” next, and stopped at the Café Dôme inMontparnasse for a citron pressé before commencing. New inspiration struckunexpectedly when, to his bemusement, he saw Nina Olivier with her latestattachment, Scottish pianist and raconteur James Hener Skene (born c. 1878).83[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts083] Accompanying them was FenellaLovell, a consumptive-looking Parisian model of 203 Boulevard Raspail. Of Romanydescent, she wrote Gypsy songs in English and Romany, and was involved in theGypsy Lore Society.84 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts084] In thesummer of 1908 she gave Romany language lessons to British poet Arthur Symons(1865–1945), who offered her hospitality and found her to be an accomplishedteacher.85 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts085] She also modeledfor many, including aspiring Welsh painter Gwen John (1876–1939), whose youngerbrother Augustus John (1878–1961) would become better known. Of Lovell, GwenJohn wrote, “no one will want to buy her portrait do you think so? … it is agreat strain doing Fenella. It is a pretty little face but she is dreadful.”86[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts086] Her beauty and dress struckCrowley, who mentally cast her as the heroine of some yet-unwritten play. Eyeingher, he wrote in his head:By the window stands Fenella, fantastically dressed in red, yellow, and blue,her black hair wreathed with flowers. She is slight, thin, with very shortskirts, her spider legs encased in pale blue stockings. Her golden shoes withtheir exaggerated heels have paste puckles. In her pale face her round blackeyes blaze. She is rouged and powdered; her thin lips are painted heavily. Hershoulder-bones stare from her low-necked dress, and a diamond dog-collar claspsher shining throat. She is about seventeen years old.87[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts087]Yes, he mused, and left minutes later. Returning to his room at 50 rue Vavin, hewrote “The Ghouls,” then proceeded immediately on to “Adonis.” He completed bothin a single forty-three-hour sitting.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_045_r1.jpg]Fenella Lovell. (photo credit 10.4)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c10-fig004a]While most of these stories appeared in the next two issues of The Equinox,88[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts088] the bulk of his work thatsummer involved the magical papers of theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg],which he wrote in abundance. These documents he divided into four classes: ClassA documents were Holy Books, “inspired” or “channeled” works not to be alteredin any way; Class B documents were scholarship; Class C were inspirational orsuggestive; and Class D were practical instructions.While most of the Thelemic Holy Books were channeled at the end of 1907, theremaining ones came to Crowley this summer. These Class A documents included:“Liber B vel Magi” (The Book of the Magus), which describes the grade of Magus9°=2°; “Liber Tzaddi vel Hamus Hermeticus” (The Book of the Hermetic Fish Hook),which calls mankind to initiation; “Liber Cheth vel Vallum Abiegni” (The Book ofthe Wall of Abiegnus, the great Rosicrucian mountain), which describes crossingthe Abyss; and “Liber A’ash vel Capricorni Pneumatici” (The Book of Creation, orthe Goat of the Spirit), an instruction in sexual magic in veiled language.89[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts089]Class B documents written at this time include “Liber Israfel,” an invocation ofthe Egyptian god Thoth written by Allan Bennett and revised by Crowley; “LiberViarum Viae” (The Way of Ways) on the tarot; “Liber Viae Memoriae vel ThIShARB”(The Way of Memory), a method for thinking backwards to understand the causesacting in one’s life; and a tentative work on the Greek kabbalah.90[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts090]Class C, or suggestive, works include “Across the Gulf,” an allegorical accountof a past life in Egypt; and “Liber Os Abysmi vel Daath” (The Book of the Mouthof the Abyss), which describes a method of entering the Abyss based upon logicalskepticism. “Adonis” he also classed in this category.The Class D, or official instructions, included the following: “Liber NV” and“Liber HAD” describe, based on the Book of the Law, how to attain the states ofconsciousness associated with these Egyptian deities. Practical instructions inyoga were summed up in books on meditation (“Liber Turris vel Domus Dei”),devotion (“Liber Astarte vel Liber Berylli”), and pranayama (“Liber RV velSpiritus”). “Liber IOD” (The Book of Vesta) contains instructions on thoughtreduction, while “Liber Resh vel Helios” (The Book of the Sun) containsadorations of the sun for dawn, noon, sunset and midnight.91[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts091] This last exercise Crowleyconsidered most important for reminding students of the Great Work, and Crowleypracticed it regularly throughout his life.On the autumnal equinox, the sixth issue of The Equinox appeared. Owing todifficulties with Fuller and Raffalovich, it was the slimmest volume to date,and notably missing was the next installment of “The Temple of Solomon theKing.” To compensate, Crowley printed “The Rites of Eleusis” as a supplement forthe public to judge its contents. Besides severalA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]libri, this issue also featured contributions from Archer and Neuburg as well asbook reviews courtesy of two of his friends, chemist Edward Whineray andFreemason John Yarker. Yarker was a new acquaintance who would go on toinfluence Crowley’s magick heavily. Yarker had previously awarded Crowley withvarious Masonic and pseudo-Masonic distinctions after his victory in courtagainst Mathers over the GD rituals reproduced in The Equinox. AC had sincereviewed Yarker’s The Arcane Schools in the fourth Equinox, writing “The readerof this treatise is at first overwhelmed by the immensity of Brother Yarker’serudition” to which the author replied with a letter of thanks for “your kindlyreview.”92 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts092]Sweet classical melodies issued from the piano; facile fingers deftly executedthe performance; and silence greeted its conclusion. Hener Skene turned from thepiano to face the man who had requested a lesson in music appreciation. “Thatwas Chopin.”“I don’t know,” Crowley remarked, desperately hiding a smile. “I think it atrifle boring.”“Oh?” Skene lifted an eyebrow. “Then how about this?” He returned to the pianoand played another piece. It was a selection from Cavalleria Rusticana (1890),the one-act opera by Pietro Mascagni (1863–1945) about a love triangle ending inbloodshed. Skene considered it a clearly inferior work.Crowley applauded. “Much better! This music moves me.”The music stopped. Skene again turned to face Crowley, who quickly replaced thesmirk on his face with an inquisitive expression. “No, no,” the pianistobjected. “You should prefer Chopin. Let’s try again.” He returned to the pianoand began another piece by the Pole.A smile returned to Crowley’s lips, and he began thinking he had judged Skenetoo hastily. When Crowley’s fiancée, Eileen Gray, first introduced them in Parisin 1902, Skene came off so witless and conceited that Crowley parodied him inthe appendix to The Star and the Garter.93[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts093] Meeting him at the Dôme foronly the second time, he found Skene so unpleasant and cadaverous that he helpedinspire “The Ghouls.”94 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts094] WhenSkene shifted his affections from Nina to dancer Isadora Duncan, to whom he wasaccompanist, he had “the manners of an undertaker gone mad, the morals of astool-pigeon, and imagining himself a bishop.”95[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts095] Despite all that, Crowley sawSkene as a potential source of fun.Chopin’s piece ended, and Skene looked again at Crowley, who wore a pensive,almost pained, scowl. “I—I think I understand,” AC stammered.“Again!” Skene declared, and returned to the ivories for more Mascagni.Crowley was so delighted he was loathe to release the moment. Then he devised away to milk the game even further. When Skene again finished, Crowley feignedrapture. “Yes, yes, I see! If you would be so kind, I’d like you to repeat thislesson for my good friend, Princess Bathurst.” Princess Leila Ida NerissaBathurst Waddell.When Crowley bumped into Skene in London on October 11, 1911, it was another oftheir many subsequent encounters. This time Skene was on his way to the Savoy,where Isadora Duncan was throwing a wild fortieth birthday party for her bestfriend, Mary Desti. Since Crowley had no particular plans, the pianist broughthim along. At this twenty-three-hour party, Crowley met Isadora Duncan(1878–1927), whom he admired as the greatest dancer of his generation; she ispreserved in Moonchild as Lavinia King, while her brother Raymond appears as “alantern-jawed American with blue cheeks.”96[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts096] The guest of honor, however,impressed him most.Standing at five-foot-five, Mary Desti (1871–1931) was a voluptuous, big-bonedwoman with curly black hair and attractive—even magnificent—Irish-Italianfeatures. Born in Quebec and raised in Chicago, she moved to Paris and adoptedDuncan’s penchant for wearing only sandals and a Greek tunic held together by apin at her shoulder; indeed, Desti gained some notoriety when her landlordattempted to evict her for dressing too scantily.97[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts097] She was a passionate, worldlywoman, and her personality and magnetism attracted Crowley straight off. Shefelt the same profound emotion toward him. He spent the evening sittingcross-legged on the floor, “exchanging electricity with her.”98[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts098][images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_046_r1.jpg]Mary Desti (1871–1931) in 1916, by E. O. Hoppé. (photo credit 10.5)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c10-fig005a]Mary Dempsey, to use her legal name,99[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts099] had been married four times.Little is known of her first marriage. Her second husband, Edmund P. Biden, wasa heavy-drinking traveling salesman whose banjo playing taught her to despisethe instrument. The birth of their son Edmund Preston on August 29, 1898, cameas a complete surprise; both were apparently naive about the facts of life. Upto the last minute, Biden believed his wife had a tumor. Their marriage ended inJanuary when Mary, fed up with Biden’s drunken rages, escaped with her infant toFrance. Reflecting on two wasted years, she detested her ex so much that shecould not speak his name. Named after his father, her boy thereby went by hismiddle name, Preston.While apartment-hunting in Paris, Mary met Mrs. Duncan, who took her home tomeet her daughter, Isadora. The two became close friends, and Mary moved intoIsadora’s Paris studio while Mrs. Duncan took charge of Preston. Mary idolizedIsadora, seeing in her the person she wanted to be.Mary wed for a third time in Memphis, Tennessee, on October 2, 1901. Her newhusband was childhood sweetheart Solomon Sturges, grandson of the pioneeringfinancier who founded Solomon Sturges and Sons, later known as the ContinentalIllinois National Bank and Trust Company of Chicago. Sturges adopted Mary’s son,and the new family was close and happy. Mary wrote a play called “The Freedom ofthe Soul,” which had a single performance at Chicago’s Ravina Park; of hiswife’s penchant for writing, Sturges remarked “it was infinitely to be preferredto bridge whist playing, and it wasn’t so hard on a man’s pocketbook.”100[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts100] After Paris, however, Chicagostifled Mary, and not even the wishes of her husband would keep her fromIsadora. The marriage became strained when Mary followed the notorious danceracross Europe. Tolerant at first, Sturges eventually tired of his wife’s dressand constant flitting across the Atlantic. After a terrible argument in 1907,they separated, and Mary later returned to Europe. Sending Preston to a Parisianboarding school, she was free to live an unconventional, liberated life. SolomonSturges was eventually granted a divorce for desertion in January 1911.Her fourth and unfortunate marriage would occur in London the following year—onFebruary 12, 1912—to Turkish fortune hunter Vely Bey.101[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts101] They had met years ago inChicago, where Bey had been trying (ultimately unsuccessfully) to launch aTurkish tobacco import company. This husband liked how she dressed, and as abonus his father was Ilias Pasha, court physician to the sultan of Turkey.102[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts102] Both mistakenly thought theother was wealthy, and only after the wedding did the economic truth come out.This, combined with Bey’s dislike of Preston, doomed the marriage from thestart. Before things blew up, Mary learned the formula for the lotion herfather-in-law had concocted to cure a rash on her face; it was supposedly commonthroughout the harems of Turkey, and it not only cleared up her rash but alsosmoothed away wrinkles. Seeing a lucrative opportunity, Mary marketed it as “LeSecret du Harem,” and founded at 4 rue de la Paix her renowned perfumery “Maisond’Este.” This name derived from Mary’s dislike of her given surname, Dempsey;some amateur genealogy linked Dempsey to Desmond and d’Este, which she adopted.However, the d’Este family in Paris threatened to sue if she did not change thename of her salon and remove the garish neon sign out front. Hence the salonbecame “Maison Desti.”Encountering the free spirit of future entrepreneur Mary d’Este or Mary Desti,Crowley couldn’t help feel she was a perfect match for him. Suddenly he foundhimself torn between his unshakable affection for Leila and the inexplicablefeeling he got from this stranger.“Preliminary skirmishing” characterized the following months as Crowley tried tomake her acquaintance. Two days after the party, he met her for tea and tried toexplain the feeling he got when they met. Unsurprisingly, she knew nothing ofmagic, but having written some plays, shared his literary aspirations. Theydined the next evening, and after a snack of chocolate and rolls, Crowley leftfor northern England.He must have come on too strongly, for she answered none of the letters he sentover the next two weeks.Scottish art editor George MacNie Cowie (1861–1948) was deaf as a result ofscarlet fever; he often felt alienated from others because of his handicap, andin 1885, he served as president of the Edinburgh Deaf and Dumb BenevolentSociety.103 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts103] Born in St.Ninians, Stirlingshire, to shoemaker William Cowie and Margaret King MacNie, hehad an older half-sister, Christian (a dressmaker born in Ireland), and ayounger sister, Isabella.104 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts104]He worked as a lithographic artist and designer, and the 1901 Scottish censuslists him as married to Elizabeth Cowie, who was born around 1851 in Coatbridge,Lanarkshire.105 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts105] Cowie was inhis forties when, reading the commentary on creation in The Perfect Way (1890)by Anna Kingsford (1846–1888) and Edward Maitland (1824–1897), he converted tovegetarianism. He was in his fifties when, on November 1, he became one of onlythree probationers to join theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]in 1911, choosing “Quarens Serenitatem” (I will seek serenity) as his motto.Employed as art editor for Edinburgh publisher Nelson’s, this new studentprompted Crowley to note, “His character was unselfish and noble, his aspirationintense and sincere.”106 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts106] Hewould prove to be one of AC’s more valuable students, advancing to Neophyte asFrater Fiat Pax (Let there be peace), and, in OTO, reaching the VIII° andserving as Grand Treasurer General.While Crowley had been away, Rose, after years of heavy drinking, was committedto an asylum on September 27. She suffered alcoholic dementia “in its mosthopeless form.”107 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts107] Crowleyhardly felt remorse over the tragedy: Rosa Decidua was his heart’s finaloutpouring for her. As he saw it, the Secret Chiefs had chosen her; failing inher divine mission, she suffered the penalties described in The Book of the Law.Now, he suspected, the Chiefs had lined him up with a new candidate.Out with the old, in with the new.On October 29, Crowley sought Mary Desti at the Savoy, prepared to bury her inbarbed words the way only a great poet could. How dare she ignore his letters!But his armor melted at the first sight of her, and he forgave all.In November—even though he was hard at work on the next Equinox, which wouldinclude The Book of the Law and an account of its reception—AC and Mary set outon a vacation to one of his favorite spots: St. Moritz. They spent November 18at Montparnasse, leaving Paris the next evening. As they traveled, Crowleystudied his 1904 notebooks, The Equinox page proofs, and the manuscript of TheBook of the Law. On the night of November 20, Mary dreamed she saw the heads offive old men called the White Brothers telling her, “It’s all right.” She didn’tknow what it meant, and, when she told AC, he showed no interest. It wasn’t hermind that he wanted to get inside.Weary from travel, they spent the night of November 21 at Zurich’s NationalHotel. “This town is so hideous and depressing that we felt our only chance ofliving through the night was to get superbly drunk,”108[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts108] Crowley wrote. More drinksfollowed; then they had sex. As a lover, Crowley was magnetic and experienced;Mary was no less so, carrying on like an amorous but infuriated lioness.As they rested in bed, exhausted but unsatiated, Mary slipped into a calm,relaxed state and began talking about the old white-bearded man from her dream.She said he held a wand in his hand, and on his hand was a ring with a featherin its glass. A large claw was on his breast.Overstimulated, Crowley surmised. The combination of alcohol and sex was toomuch for her. As she continued, however, Crowley realized she was not recountingher dream of the previous night but was describing this old man as she saw himright now. It reminded him of Rose’s strange, dazed condition when she contactedthe Chiefs.He sat upright and instructed her, “Make yourself perfectly passive. Let himcommunicate freely. What do you see?”The five white brethren turned red, she said, and spoke: “Here is a book to begiven to Frater P.” Crowley nearly fell over with surprise: Mary did not knowhis magical name. “The name of the book is Aba,” she continued, “and its numberis four.”Crowley computed the values of the letters a, b, and a and came up with four.This was more knowledge she did not possess. So far, so good. Mary went on todescribe a swarthy man named Jezel, who was hunting for the book. However, theelder commented, Frater P. would get it.Suddenly, the vision became unclear, and Mary grew frightened. She didn’tunderstand what this was all about. Crowley encouraged her to continue. “What’shis name?” he asked.Abuldiz, she replied.“What about seventy-eight?” AC asked, giving a number of Aiwass.“He says he is seventy-eight.”“What is sixty-five?” he tested again, giving the number of Adonai, the generalgodname for the holy guardian angel.“Frater P is sixty-five, and his age is 1,400.” Pure gibberish, he thought.“What of Krasota?” he asked about the Word of the Equinox. Abuldiz the wizardonly frowned in reply. Crowley was dissatisfied, and remained skeptical eventhough Abuldiz insisted Crowley show faith. Through Mary, Abuldiz promised toclear everything up in a week, at precisely 11 p.m. He instructed Crowley, atthat time, to invoke as he did in Cairo in 1904.An odd coincidence, he mused, as the rituals he used with Rose in 1904 wereagain in his possession as he prepared to publish The Book of the Law.Furthermore, he just happened to have with him all the necessary ritualimplements, including the robe he wore at the Cairo Working in 1904. Mary hadeven packed a blue and gold abbai like Rose’s. Arriving at St. Moritz the nextday, their suite at the Palace Hotel contained a tall mirror very much like theone in his honeymoon suite in Cairo. This impending publication of The Book ofthe Law, he assumed, was causing a magical stir.In the following days, Crowley told Mary everything he knew about magic. Thisway, he ensured that Abuldiz could only convince him of his authenticity byrevealing something neither of them knew; it would have to be big. “Anything shesaid three times she believed fervently,” her son attested to Mary’simagination. “Often twice was enough.”109[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts109] Coming from an intellect likeCrowley’s, the words opened a new dimension of reality that she acceptedwholeheartedly. She found this business of magic fascinating.On November 28 they prepared for the ceremony as instructed. They stowed allunnecessary furniture. Five chairs sat out for the five brethren. An octagonaltable served as the altar, holding the magical weapons, invocations, andincense. Mary, wearing her abbai with rich jewels as described in The Book ofthe Law,110 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts110] sat on the floorfacing the mirror in the east. Dressed in his usual robes, Crowley kindled theincense and performed the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram at 10:38 p.m.By 10:45, he began reciting the Augoeides vigorously. At the stroke of eleven,he uttered, “Cujus nomen est Nemo, FraterA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg],adest.” (I am he whose name is Nemo, a Brother of theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg].)“He’s here,” Mary replied solemnly. “He wants to know what you want.”“Nothing!” he snapped. “Did I call him, or he me?”“He called you … but there is seventy-seven.”That was Leila’s number, and Crowley momentarily remembered his lover in London.Then, returning to the present, he asked, “Why did you call me?”“He says, ‘To give you this book.’ ”“How will it be given?”“He says, ‘By the seer.’ But I don’t have any book!”“Do you claim to be a Brother of theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]?”“He hasA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]in black letters on his breast.”“What doesA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]mean?”With this test, the vision became garbled. She saw images and symbols, numbersthat meant little to either of them.“Ask him to be slower and simpler,” Crowley finally insisted. “Give furthersigns of your identity: Are you Sapiens Dominabitur Astris?” This was the mottoof the GD’s German contact, Fraulein Sprengel.“I see nothing but a skull,” Mary replied.Good, Crowley thought to himself: Sprengel is dead. “Is Deo Duce Comite Ferroone of you?” He dragged Mathers into it.“No. No longer,” she replied as Abuldiz. After a few more questions, Mary beganto complain of someone beside her, breathing on her. Looking about, Crowleycould see small elementals bounding about the room.“Ask who breathes,” he instructed.“The black man,” she replied. “He has now a white turban.” Using a techniqueCrowley had taught her, she banished the figure away. More garbled communicationfollowed, with Abuldiz finally stating, “Ask me about nine.”Crowley raised an eyebrow. “Consider yourself asked.”“Nine is the number of a page in a book.”“We have none in stock. What book?”“A book of fools.” Only in later years would this make sense to Crowley,referring to his authorship of The Book of Wisdom of Folly after he assumed thegrade of Magus (9°=2°). The communication went off on another apparent tangent.After a futile exchange, Mary announced, “He shows another book with a blazingsun, and covers in gold. He says, ‘The Book IV. Your instruction to theBrothers.’ ”“Then I’m not to publish it?”“Abuldiz gives the sign of silence.”He nodded. “I understand by that that I am not to publish it.”“Never. But you are to find it.”When more gibberish followed, Crowley lost his patience. “Does he wish to go onwith this very unsatisfactory conversation?”Mary, as Abuldiz, replied, “Go to London, find Book IV, and return it to theBrothers.”“Where is Book IV?”“In London. When you get Book IV, you’ll know what the white feather means. Obeyand return Book IV to the Brothers.” By this time, after over nearly an hour,Mary complained she was tired.Crowley agreed. “Ask for another appointment.”Abuldiz replied, “The fourth of December, between 7 and 9 p.m.”Fine. “Good-bye!”The communication of December 4 was very much like the last. Contacting Abuldizat 9 p.m., Mary announced they had better get to London quickly and find BookIV, even though neither one of them had any idea what book this was, or how togo about locating it. When Crowley asked Mary’s magical name, Abuldiz respondedVIRAKAM; convinced of the importance of this work, she became Soror Virakam.Further communications with Abuldiz occurred on December 10, 11, 13, and 19. Inall but the last instance, the communication began with champagne, sex, andincantations. They gradually came to the understanding that they needed to go ona retirement and write Book IV themselves. During the last communication, atMilan, Crowley received the final details.By this time, Crowley asked questions in acronym form to further test thewizard. “N.w.a.t.V.?” Now what about the villa?Abuldiz replied, “What you will. Patience; there is danger of health.”“H.o.f.?” Here or further?“No. You asked wrongly.”“H?” Here?“W?” Where? “R?” Rome?“No.”“N?” Naples?“Yes.”“Is Virakam to work herself, or only to help Perdurabo?”“Virakam is to work, to serve.” This was appropriate, as Abuldiz had previouslytold them the word meant “I serve the light.” “Tomorrow you will find what youseek; you will know, for he will be with you and give you the sign. Don’thesitate and don’t worry, bring forth the fruit. Till tomorrow.”“Good-bye!”“There is no good-bye. There’s work to be done; I’m always ready. Don’tstruggle. Accept and believe.” He held a finger to his eye, and was gone.Crowley now understood: he and Mary were to travel past Rome and rent a villa.When Abuldiz told Crowley how to recognize the Villa—“You will recognize itbeyond the possibility of doubt or error”—he had a vision of a villa on ahillside, with a garden and two Persian nut trees in the yard. There they wouldwrite Book IV, a text of practical magic.They left for Rome the next day.111[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts111]Bickering tarnished the first few days in Rome. Actually, bickering was anunderstatement. It seemed that when they weren’t engaged in drunken lovemaking,AC and Mary could only fight. This maelstrom of passion—and their faith inAbuldiz—was what kept them together.As instructed, they moved past Rome after two or three days, combing the Naplescountryside for a place matching Abuldiz’s description. They expected to finddozens of suitable villas, but were sadly disappointed: after days motoringthrough the city and suburbs, they failed to find a single match. The villabecame an obsession. They discussed it while driving and eating, and one nightMary even dreamed of it.The day after her dream, Mary’s son, Preston, was joining them for Christmas.The arrival of his train at four that afternoon cut short an idle search inPosilippo, a promontory southwest of Naples. After a futile cursory tour, Marybecame anxious about Preston’s arrival, and insisted they head for the station.As they drove down the road, however, Mary suddenly cried out. “Turn! Turn downthat road.” The “road” was a trail leading off the main thoroughfare, so slightas to be virtually indistinguishable.Crowley regarded her blankly. A minute ago, she was in a hellfire hurry.“Damn it,” she urged the chauffeur, “turn off! The villa is down that road. I’msure of it.”Once the car detoured onto the path as she demanded, they found themselves on anarrow washboard road that deposited them on a low stone parapet, a slopedropping down to their right. “There!” Mary chirped excitedly. “It’s the villa Isaw in my dream.”Crowley and the chauffeur craned their necks about. AC looked quizzical, thentried to speak rationally to her. “Mary, there’s no villa here.”She huffed. “You’re right. But I know it’s here. Chauffeur, drive on.” As theycontinued, they encountered a tiny piazza and church. It was the square she hadseen in her dream. “Keep going,” she urged the driver. After one hundred yards,the road became even more rugged, steep and narrow, rock piles blocking parts ofthe road. The chauffeur slowed and complained he could go no further. Turningaround or backing up to the square were impossible. “Do as I say, you bastard,”Mary hollered. She was livid, and violence was a distinct possibility. “Keepdriving.”The chauffeur glanced at Crowley, who merely shrugged his shoulders. Theycontinued a few more yards, after which the chauffeur stopped and flatly refusedto proceed.Mary cursed and punched the seat. Looking out the window, she saw an open gateto the left. Within, workmen were repairing a dilapidated villa. She burst outof the car and approached the foreman, asking in broken Italian if the buildingwas for rent. Even though it wasn’t, she was undeterred, and forced him to showher the place.Amused, Crowley opened the door, sat in the car and watched the fiasco.Disgusting, he mused. Eventually, his gaze followed the grounds of the villa outto its garden. At its end he spotted two Persian nut trees, correspondingexactly to his vision. His amusement turned to astonishment.Looking at the name on the gate, he computed its numerical value. VillaKaldarazzo added up to 418. This was the number of Ra Hoor, Abrahadabra, andother key terms in The Book of the Law. Excitement finally infected him. Theyhad found the villa that Abuldiz indicated.AC leapt out of the car and hurried into the house, catching up to Mary and theforeman in the main room. Looking about, the walls decorated with crudefrescoes, he believed this building had the atmosphere and emanation necessaryfor the Great Work. Learning the villa was not for rent, Crowley demanded thename and address of its owner. In the midst of their excitement, a practicalthought intruded: Preston. On the verge of another panic, Mary grabbed AC’selbow and urged them to the train station.Crowley disliked Preston, and the feeling was mutual. To AC, the brat was agodforsaken lout. This, however, was a compliment compared to what Prestoncalled the “phonus bolonus” her mother had taken up with. He loathed Crowley andin later years remarked, “I realize my mother and I were lucky to escape withour lives. If I had been a little older he might not have escaped with his.”112[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts112] To the thirteen-year-oldyouth, far from home and missing his adoptive father, Crowley seemed like amonster.The next morning, they found the owner of the villa and convinced him to rent itto them. Wasting no time, they moved in the following day, consecrated thetemple, and began work on Book Four. Simplicity was their goal: Crowleydictated, and anywhere he was unclear, Virakam stopped him for clarification.Thus they planned an exposition that people from any walk of life couldunderstand. Crowley envisioned Book Four in four parts: part one would deal withyoga, part two with magical implements, part three with Crowley’s theory of“Magick,” and part four with his commentary on The Book of the Law.As they worked, the world saw many changes: New Mexico and Arizona became the47th and 48th states; the Manchu Dynasty was overthrown, and China became arepublic; coal miners went on strike in Britain; and on April 15, the Titanicsank along with 1,513 passengers.At one point in the dictation, after working feverishly until midnight, Crowleysat back, dissatisfied with his words. “If I could only dictate a book like theTao Teh King,” he lamented. Mary watched as his face changed. His pupils dilatedinto large, dark discs. She wasn’t even sure if he was still the same person.He’s meditating, she thought when he closed his eyes, but then a yellow lightbathed the room. She looked around but found no source for the light. Then thestranger and his chair rose, the chair looking like a throne and the masterappearing asleep or dead. She looked desperately about the room, then, alone andoverwhelmed, passed out.Whether a vision or a dream, the experience betrayed Mary’s sense of alienation:although they got through writing part two, their relationship deteriorated intohostility. After another major argument, Mary left and returned to Paris.Shortly thereafter, she telegraphed AC, apologizing for her rashness andinviting him to join her in Paris. This he did, but when they returned toLondon, the Turk in Abuldiz’s vision appeared in the form of Veli Bey, thefuture husband who Crowley believed spoiled the Great Work. The story, however,was more complicated than that. To Crowley’s disappointment, Mary had begunshowing signs of alcoholism. Just like Rose, he mused; and this certainlycontributed to their separation. In the end, he attributed their break to “myown great default of faith in her, more than her quite justified distrust ofme.”113 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts113] Neither one was likelydespondent over their separation: Mary had Isadora, Crowley had Leila, and allwas well with the world.As for Book Four, a decade would pass before Crowley finished part three, andnearly two decades before it would be published. The fourth part, published in1936 as The Equinox of the Gods, would be promoted more as another installmentof The Equinox than the final part of Book Four.Mary Desti’s name nevertheless graced the next four numbers of The Equinox,replacing Crowley as editor (doubtlessly to silence the yellow press). She alsocontributed a few pieces to the journal: the play “Doctor Bob,” which shecoauthored with Crowley,114 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts114]her poem “On—On—Poet,”115 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts115] andthe play “The Tango,” another Desti-Crowley collaboration.116[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts116]After they parted, Mary became wealthy with her Maison Desti, her products sopopular that the Cody Corporation offered to buy her out. Her son, PrestonSturges, eventually returned to America and became a successful scriptwriter andmovie director in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s; while his first screenplay made astar out of actor Spencer Tracy (1900–1967), Sturges is best known for thecomedies he directed. Looking back on Crowley, Mary would always recall himfondly as a model of charm and good manners, possessing one of the greatestminds she had encountered in her entire life.117[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c10-nts117]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ELEVENORDO TEMPLI ORIENTISThe spring 1912 Equinox is arguably the most important issue of the set. For thefirst time, Crowley’s name vanished from the masthead, which instead listed Maryd’Este Sturges as editor and Victor Neuburg as subeditor. Although Crowley, asthe issue reported, was away on a magical retirement, the issue bore hisunmistakable stamp. In addition to contributions from Ethel Archer, HerbertClose, and John Yarker, it featured manyA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]libri as well as the next “Temple of Solomon the King,” which recounted howCrowley received The Book of the Law in Cairo in 1904. The article featuredextracts from his 1903–1904 diaries, a facsimile reproduction of the manuscript,and full-color plates of the stele. For this first publication of The Book ofthe Law, Crowley wrote a short comment on its verses; he considered itinadequate, but it was the best he could do at the time.The price for this issue went up, partly to cover the cost of engraving itsplates. Besides the stele reproductions, the issue also included severalphotographs. Some dubbed them pornographic; in them, with genitalia carefullypainted out, a naked and overweight Crowley demonstrated yogic postures. Thecorresponding text read:Some of the weaker brethren having found the postures in Liber E too difficult,the pitiful heart of the Praemonstrator ofA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]has been moved to authorise the publication of additional postures, which willbe found facing this page. An elderly, corpulent gentleman of sedentary habithas been good enough to pose, so that none need feel debarred from devotinghimself to the Great Work on the ground of physical infirmity.Crowley, as always, had his tongue planted in cheek.A lithograph of a sketch of Crowley commissioned from Welsh artist Augustus John(1878–1961) also appeared in this issue. The Equinox offices offered thirtycopies for sale for a guinea apiece. The quality of reproduction pleased Johnwhen he saw the issue; however, as Crowley never paid him for the originalsketch and was now selling lithos without permission, John wrote him a perturbedletter. “Would you mind explaining your idea in this? Are you going to make £30out of the drawing instead of me? If so, you will indeed be a great magician!”1[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts001] As AC owned neither the sketchnor the prints,2 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts002] he haltedsale of the prints. Despite this dispute, John and Crowley became good friends.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_047_r1.jpg]Augustus John (1878–1961).

(photo credit 11.2)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c11-fig002a]Crowley spent that spring working on Book Four, dictating part three—the portionon practical magic—to Leila. He was unhappy with it, and felt completelyunprepared for part four, which would be the full commentary on The Book of theLaw. Instead, he busied himself with other productions. He wrote “EnergizedEnthusiasm,” an essay on ecstasy and magick, and “The Testament of MagdalenBlair.” This latter work, dealing with the types of thoughts accompanyingsickness and death, he considered to be his best short story, based on an ideaAllan Bennett had given him back in 1898.Book Four, Part One by Frater Perdurabo and Soror Virakam came out at this time,selling for four groats (one shilling). Mortadello, or the Angel of Venice: AComedy, followed. Like most of his books at this time, The High History of GoodSir Palamedes the Saracen Knight and of His Following of the Questing Beast waspublished by the publishing firm operated by Ethel Archer’s husband, Wieland &Company. Selling at five shillings, it bore the snide imprint date of AnnoPseudo Christi 1912. Of this reprint from The Equinox, reviewers from theEnglish Review wrote “it makes the heart bleed to reflect that he might havelearnt more in three minutes’ conversation with Mr. Crowley than in all thosewanderings.”3 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts003] Also appearingwere Crowley’s reissue of Amphora, retitled Hail Mary!, and his criticallyacclaimed Household Gods: A Comedy. Finally, the May 26, 1912, issue of the NewYork Times printed Crowley’s poem “Titanic Disaster” in comemoration of theship’s sinking the prior month; Crowley would reprint the article in The Equinoxfor spring 1913.4 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts004]By far, the most important book in this crop was Liber CCCXXXIII: The Book ofLies, Which Is Also Falsely Called Breaks, the Wanderings or Falsifications ofthe One Thought of Frater Perdurabo, Which Thought Is Itself Untrue. Knownsimply as The Book of Lies, this book is a little masterpiece of wit and wisdomas rewarding as it is demanding. Its ninety-one pithy chapters sometimes containlove poems to Leila (“Laylah” here), sometimes tangled kabbalistic puzzles, andoften some clever and subtle pun. For instance, its chapter eighty-three istitled “The Blind Pig” because the two letters that add up to eighty-three, pand g, are “pig” without an i. Even its errata slip bears the playful comment,“It seems absurd, as the whole book is a misprint.” The subtitle “Breaks” refersto thoughts that intrude upon meditation; hence the Occult Review correctlyassessed the book:I am not at all sure what is the meaning (assuming there to be one) of thisfantastic book by Mr. Aleister Crowley. Some of its chapters seem entirenonsense, but in others I can discern something of a philosophy which is anegation of philosophy; which regards thought as the excrement of mind, andreason as foolishness.… Certainly such philosophy as this is a lie, if that isthe meaning of the title.But indeed, I am inclined to regard the book rather as a fantastic and elaboratejoke; and I can imagine its author laughing at the thought of its readersstriving to extract a profound meaning out of words which have no meaning.5[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts005]Most significant of all is Crowley’s comment, “There is no joke or subtlemeaning in the publisher’s imprint.”6[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts006] This, of course, is a tip-offthat the imprint is incorrect: although the book advertises a 1913 date, it wasin fact published in 1912; an ad for the book even appears in the September 1912Equinox as “Now Ready.” This wasn’t the first time AC used a false imprint date;Snowdrops from a Curate’s Garden several years earlier was dated 1881.Regardless, Crowley tried all his life to conceal the pun, insisting that hisdispute over the book with Theodor Reuss that summer was so sublime as tosomehow defy the course of time.Crowley answered the door to his flat at 124 Victoria Street to find Herr Reusspeering at him through pince-nez, his handlebar mustache curling up at the edgesof his face while his mouth curled down in a dour expression. “You havepublished the secret of the IX°,” he claimed, referring to the innermost secretof Ordo Templi Orientis, “and you must take the corresponding oaths.”Nonplussed, Crowley admitted into his flat the head of OTO.Reuss feared Crowley would advertise their secret the way he had published theGD’s rituals in The Equinox, so he insisted Crowley take the appropriate oathsof secrecy. AC had no idea what this man was ranting about: after Mathers v.Crowley, Reuss had made him VII°, an honor corresponding to the 33° ofFreemasonry (the highest honor conferred in the Scottish Rite). Of the gradesbeyond VII° and their instructions, which were peculiar to OTO., Crowley knewnothing. He protested, “I have done nothing of the sort. I don’t know thesecret, and I don’t want to know the secret.”“The magical secret of sex? But of course you do.” Reuss stepped across the roomto Crowley’s bookcases and retrieved a copy of the newly printed Book of Lies.Opening to page forty-six, he handed the little volume over. Crowley rememberedthe chapter, titled “The Star Sapphire.” It was a ritual he wrote in an exaltedstate of mind, similar to that of the Holy Books, and he included it because hewas uncomfortable altering or deleting the ritual. Reading the words “Let theAdept be armed with his Magick Rood [and provided with his Mystic Rose],” thesexual symbolism of magic struck Crowley. The Rosicrucian symbols of the rood,cross, and rose were codes for the male and female genitalia. In that awakening,he recognized the same hints in the writings of alchemy and mysticism the worldover. In Crowley’s own words, it was “one of the greatest shocks of my life.”7[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts007] Although the idea ofconnecting sex with ritual was not new to him—he had learned its usefulness withVirakam in contacting Abuldiz, with his work The Scented Garden, with Neuburg inthe thirty Aethyrs, with his Holy Book Stellae Rubeae, and possibly even fromthe GD’s informal instructions on Thomas Lake Harris—the idea that it had beenspelled out for ages, veiled by the simplest symbols, was staggering.For the next two hours the magicians discussed this mystery. Reuss explained tohim the sacredness of OTO’s secret and asked Crowley never improperly to revealit. By the time the conversation was over, Reuss conferred upon Crowley andLeila the IX°, authorized the foundation of a British chapter of OTO, and askedCrowley to revise and flesh out the order’s sketchy ceremonies. In exchange,Crowley agreed to allow The Equinox to serve as the OTO’s official organ inEngland.Albert Karl Theodor Reuss (1855–1923) was known in the order as Frater MerlinPeregrinus and was the author of works like What Is Occultism? and What Should IKnow about Freemasonry?8 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts008] Hewas born in Augsburg to the German innkeeper Franz Xavier Reuss and the Brit EvaBarbara Margaret Wagner. In 1876, at age twenty-one, he found himself in theUnited Kingdom, taking his Masonic initiation at London’s German-speakingPilgrim Lodge No. 238,9 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts009] andmarrying Delphina Garbois of Dublin, a woman ten years his senior, in Ireland.They returned to Munich two years later and had a son, the eccentric andprolific amateur herpetologist Albert Franz Theodor Reuss (1879–1958);10[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts010] the marriage, however, wassoon annulled by the German courts because Garbois was already married.11[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts011] Reuss soon began working as asinger at the Royal Theater (Munich), the German Opera (Amsterdam), and theRichard Wagner Festival (Bayreuth), where he sang in the first performance ofParsifal in 1882. In June 1885 he debuted in London at St. James’s Hall, singing“Qui sdegno non s’accende” (“Within These Sacred Walls”) from Mozart’s The MagicFlute.12 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts012] Before long, Reussmoved on to concert promotion.13[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts013] Whether performing orpromoting concerts, Reuss was simultaneously working as a journalist and a spy:he had joined the Socialist League, working secretly as an informer for thePrussian political police and denouncing the anarchist Victor Dave until Reusswas exposed and expelled in 1886.14[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts014][images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_048_r1.jpg]Outer Head of Ordo Templi Orientis, Theodor Reuss (1855–1923). (photo credit11.3) [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c11-fig003a]Parallel with these activities, Reuss also had an abiding interest in theoccult. He states that he joined the TS in London in 1885, knew H. P. Blavatsky,and was at Avenue Road in May 1891 when her ashes were put into a casket.15[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts015] In 1894, Reuss published thearticle “Pranatherapie” in the German Theosophical journal Sphinx.16[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts016] In 1895 he joined LeopoldEngel’s (1858–1931) attempt to revive the Bavarian Illuminati.17[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts017] Significantly, around 1898 hemet Austrian industrial chemist Carl Kellner (1851–1905), who sought toestablish an Academia Masonica within which the various degrees of high-gradeFreemasonry could be conferred in German-speaking nations. While the Blue Lodgeor first three degrees of Freemasonry—Entered Apprentice (1°), Fellow Craft(2°), and Master Mason (3°)—are universal, a number of optional, pendant ritesproliferated at this time, claiming to provide greater insight into the threeBlue Lodge degrees and offering numbered degrees beyond the third. Theseattracted many Master Masons (a requirement of admission to any of the higherdegrees) who sincerely desired greater insight into the craft. Over the years,these rites were juggled and combined until a few standards emerged, such as theRoyal Arch, Cryptic Rite, Knights Templar, and Scottish Rite. Many othersystems—including those cultivated by Kellner and his colleagues—were eventuallyregarded as something between quaintly outdated to patently fraudulent (thevehemence of denunciation corresponding to how closely the rite in questionresembled the legitimate degrees).“Kellner was, of course, the reconstructor of the O.T.O.,” Crowley wrote. “Reussalways spoke of him as quite a hors ligne.”18[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts018] However, because Kellnerdisapproved of the Illuminati, the idea lay dormant until Reuss apparently brokewith Engel. Thereupon, Kellner and Reuss began collaborating with like-mindedpeople like Franz Hartmann and Henry Klein.Dr. Franz Hartmann (1838–1912) was a German physician, Theosophist, andRosicrucian who, like Reuss, was a contributor to Sphinx. He had been at Adyarin 1885 doing damage control when the controversial Hodgson Report to theSociety for Psychical Research proclaimed Blavatsky a fraud, and he laterpublished his own Theosophical journal, Lotusblüten (1893–1900). Hartmann wasprolific with articles and books like Magic, White and Black and Secret Symbolsof the Rosicrucians.19 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts019]Hartmann knew Kellner professionally.20[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts020]Henry Klein (c. 1843–1913) was a Bavarian-born naturalized British subject.21[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts021] Although initiated intoFreemasonry at the same German-English Pilgrim Lodge No. 238 as Reuss, heresigned two years before Reuss joined.22[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts022] Despite being partially deaf,he worked as a composer, arranger, publisher, and distributor of popular sheetmusic through his business, Henry Klein & Co. Significantly, he was secretary tothe New Philharmonic Society and later to the Popular Wagner Concerts Society,for whom Reuss sang early in his career;23[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts023] this may have been the vehiclethrough which Klein and Reuss first met. Klein became a concert manager andimpresario in 1885,24 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts024] some twoyears before Reuss followed suit, and one wonders if Klein may have mentoredhim. By the time Reuss met Kellner, Klein had branched out into importing andwholesaling pianos, organs, polyphons, phonographs, and other musical devices.He retired in 1906; his business was acquired by the New Polyphon SupplyCompany, and Klein and Co. continued to operate through 1909.25[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts025]Together, Kellner, Reuss, Hartmann, and Klein acquired authority to operatevarious esoteric rites, such as the Swedenborgian Rite (from William WynnWestcott), the Ancient and Primitive Rite of Memphis-Mizraim (from John Yarker),the Martinist Order (from Gérard Encausse),26[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts026] and a form of the ScottishRite deriving from the controversial Joseph Cerneau. Many Masons consideredthese rites to be clandestine or spurious; however, they were popular amongstthe esoterically minded Masonic fringe. Reuss began publishing the Oriflamme in190227 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts027] as the official organof these collected rites.28 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts028]At some point after Kellner’s death in 1905, Reuss combined the various ritesinto one system that would become Ordo Templi Orientis, establishing ten gradesor degrees numbered O to IX.29 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts029]Degrees O–VII reputedly concentrated all the teachings of Freemasonry; indeed,the similarity was so great that OTO at one time allowed Freemasons to affiliateas members up to the corresponding OTO degree. Beyond the VII° awaited what wascalled, under Kellner’s tenure, the “Inner Triangle.” This was where memberslearned esoteric teachings originating outside Freemasonry. Because few ofKellner’s writings survive, the nature of these teachings has been the source ofsome controversy: some have argued that it involved yoga, in which Kellner wasclearly knowledgable. Others claim that it taught sacred sexuality, since thisbecame the central secret of OTO under Reuss. Because both sexes were necessaryto practice this great secret, OTO also differed significantly from traditionalMasonry in admitting both men and women as members.Kellner reputedly had discovered this great secret from three teachers whiletraveling in the East. Certainly, Kellner learned yoga from three teacherscommonly identified with him—yogi Sri Agamya Paramahamsa (with whom Crowley wasacquainted) and fakirs Soliman ben Aissa and Bheema Sena Pratapa originallyhailed from the Middle East and Far East and knew Kellner in Europe—but there isno evidence that any of them practiced sexual mysticism.30[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts030] Indeed, the system ultimatelypromoted by Reuss appears to draw on American mystic Paschal Beverly Randolph(1825–1875), who introduced sex magic to America and Europe through hissocieties Fraternitas Rosae Crucis (the first Rosicrucian order in America) andthe Fellowship of Eulis, as well as books from The Grand Secret to Eulis.31[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts031] Randolph was arrested andtried in 1872 for publishing explicitly sexual materials, but his teachings wereincorporated by other groups. One of these was the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor(or of Light), another school whose mysteries OTO claimed to assimilate.32[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts032]Under Reuss, the order soon claimed several hundred members, although a seriesof dissensions and controversies effectively decimated that number. Some havesuggested that OTO existed only on paper prior to Reuss joining forces withCrowley; prior to that time, Reuss primarily operated the individual rites inwhich he had authority. A case in point is the membership of Austrianesotericist Rudolf Steiner (1861–1925), later founder of the AnthroposophicalSociety and on whose philosophy the Waldorf Schools are based. Because of theuncertainty over precisely when the Academia Masonica of Kellner became the OrdoTempli Orientis of Reuss, Steiner has been erroneously called a member of OTO;indeed, even Crowley quipped that “Rudolf Steiner discovered what the secret ofthe IX° did actually mean and took flight.”33[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts033] The truth is that Reusschartered Steiner to operate a Memphis-Mizraim lodge called Mystica Aeterna.This he did from 1906 to 1914, but he ultimately decided to devote his attentionto his own Anthroposophical Society.34[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts034]Reuss brought Crowley into his circle while preparing for the tenth anniversaryor “jubilee” issue of The Oriflamme. The exact date is uncertain, as records donot survive and Crowley refers to two installation ceremonies, one taking placein Berlin and another in London. Crowley’s charter from Reuss is dated April 21,1912, and is issued from Berlin and London. However, Crowley’s Constitution ofMysteria Mystica Maxima (MMM, the British section of OTO) gives the date of itsfoundation as June 1 in London.35[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts035] Crowley presumably receivedhis charter in Berlin, but a formal installation ceremony later took place inLondon. In any case, AC received the X° title of “Supreme and Holy King ofIreland, Ionia and all the Britains within the Sanctuary of the Gnosis”—or, inplain English, administrative head of OTO for the United Kingdom. In thiscapacity, Crowley adopted the motto of “Baphomet” after the horned god theTemplars were accused of worshiping when persecuted by the Catholic Church in1307–1314.Returning to London, Crowley worked on setting up MMM, printing up membershipcertificates, opening offices at 93 Regent Street—and later at 33 Avenue Studiosand 76 Fulham Road in South Kensington—and recruiting initiates. Among the firstmembers was Eugene “Bunco” Wieland, whose certificate from Reuss is dated August18, 1912. George M. Cowie and Vittoria Cremers followed as the order’s secretaryand treasurer, respectively. On February 15, 1913, Crowley approved and signedthe constitution of the MMM He also made good on his agreement to rewrite theOTO rituals; as he wrote:John Yarker saw in 1911 and 1912 that his 33 degrees were themselves unworkable.He gave me a printed copy of the 30 rituals—4° to 33°—the first three, ofcourse, the Craft degrees of Masonry. This devastating volume I took with me onone of my journeys across the Sahara desert, and from it extracted anything thatseemed useful to preserve, and very little there was. The desert was left dry.All of it, such as it is, is incorporated in the rituals of the O.T.O.36[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts036]Rites of Eleusis actress Ione de Forest (Jeanne Heyse) had become an art studentand had gotten involved in the social circle of the New Freewoman,37[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts037] a feminist journal run by DoraMarsden (1882–1960) and Rebecca West (1892–1983), to which both Ezra Pound andRichard Aldington (1892–1962) were literary editors.38[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts038] In December 1911 she alsomarried engraver Wilfred Merton (1888–1957), a Trinity College graduate and avidbook collector credited with rescuing “the once-famous Chiswick Press,” who hadprinted Crowley’s early works.39[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts039] She nevertheless carried on anaffair with Victor Neuburg; this resulted in Wilfred naming both Jeanne andVictor as respondents in a divorce complaint.40[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts040] Separating around early Junepending their court date, her husband provided her with a £300 annual allowance,and she moved into a flat at Rosetti Studios, Flood Street, Chelsea. This,combined with the death of her father earlier in the year,41[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts041] made for a stressfulsituation.During these events, Heyse’s art school peer Nina Hamnett (1890–1956) grewfascinated with Jeanne and Victor’s talk of the Rites. Despite rumors thatCrowley was so clever and wicked that no young girl was safe alone with him,Nina, still a virgin, wanted to meet him. So they took her to his VictoriaStreet flat. “Extremely intelligent,” she noted after that first visit, “and notvery bad.”Crowley asked her to paint four panels for him, one for each element. This shedid, noticing that the day she painted the fire panel, three blazes mysteriouslybroke out in the studio. On another occasion, while she painted, the secretaryleft on business. She was alone with Crowley, who was asleep on the rug by thefireplace. Nina pondered anew the rumors about AC, and feared for her safety.When the magician stirred, she held her breath. He sat up and stared at her.“Are you alone?”Meekly, she replied, “Yes.”At that, he lay back down and returned to sleep.42[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts042]On Thursday, August 1, Jeanne announced to Nina that she was leaving in themorning for a long time, possibly not returning. She offered Nina her clothes ifshe were to come by; an underfunded art student, Nina gratefully accepted.Arriving the next morning, she found pinned to the door an envelope containingthe keys to the flat. Nina let herself in. She looked and called for her friendbut received no reply. Then, drawing aside a long red curtain, she discoveredher friend’s dead body.Jeanne had shot herself through the heart with a pearl-handled revolver.On a nearby table was a copy of her wedding certificate, her gun license, and anote addressed to the Coroner:The last statement of Jeanne Merton, living under the professional name ofJeanne de Forest, being an art student. I hereby state that, although of soundmind, I intend to commit suicide to-night because of the intolerable position inwhich my extremely rash and unfortunate marriage has placed me. It is my wishthat my body be cremated.In retrospect, she had threatened suicide over the months to both her husbandand her solicitor, E. S. P. Haynes, but no one had taken her seriously. The dayshe died, her solicitor received a letter saying “I cannot endure things anylonger.” Her husband, meanwhile, received the note, “You have killed me.” Aninquest ruled her death as “suicide during temporary insanity.”43[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts043] Griefstricken, Ezra Poundwaited a year to write—and even longer to publish—the obituary poem, “DeadIönè:”Empty are the ways,Empty are the ways of this landAnd the flowers Bend over with heavy heads.They bend in vain.Empty are the ways of this land  Where IoneWalked once, and now does not walkBut seems like a person just gone.44[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts044]The eighth Equinox appeared that September as the joint organ of theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]and MMM. Fiction, poetry, and drama dominated the issue, which featured a violinpiece by Leila titled “Thelema: A Tone-Testament,” “Three Poems” by Neuburg, andthe play “Doctor Bob,” jointly penned by Desti and Crowley. AC’s vicious streakran wild in attacks on A. E. Waite (“Waite’s Wet or the Backslider’s Return”)and his uncle Tom Bishop (“My Crapulous Contemporaries No. VI: AnObituary” … except he wasn’t dead). The supplement contained the issue’s onlymagical text, and it was a work of tremendous value: “Sepher Sephiroth” was anumerological dictionary of kabbalistic terms. The work, begun by Allan Bennett,benefitted from contributions by Crowley, Jones, Neuburg, and Gerald G. RaeFraser (who joined theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]in 1910).45 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts045] This referencework represents one of Crowley’s most important contributions to occultliterature.Nevertheless,A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]recruitment continued to wind down, with only three new members joining since1911: Vittoria Cremers, Olivia Haddon, and painter Leon Engers Kennedy. ThatDecember, Crowley reviewed the status of hisA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]probationers. Of some eighty-five students, only eight had advanced to Neophyte,with seven more “on the path.” Compared with the GD and OTO, these figures weredisappointing. Clearly, his energy was better directed toward the MMM.Author Katherine Mansfield (1888–1923) first heard of Crowley through herfriend, John Middleton Murry (1889–1957), who in turn had met AC around 1910through his Oxford friend Frederick Goodyear (1887–1917).46[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts046] Little is known of Goodyear’sassociation with Crowley; however, Goodyear’s lead article “The New Thelema” forthe first issue of Rhythm proclaimed:Thelema lies in the future, not the never-never land of the theologian, but theordinary human future that is perpetually transmuting itself into the past.These familiar to-morrows that keep breaking on the shore of the world throw upevery time some priceless jetsam for its strengthening or decoration. No magic,no divine interference will affect the rise of Thelema. It will be independentof petty dynastic incidents such as the fall of Saturn, or the accession ofJove. The wrath of the Lord of Hosts is powerless to blast it. Men shall builtit; this planet is its chosen site.47[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts047]While Goodyear may be alluding to Rabelais, his words also resonate withCrowley’s Thelema. Since the exact date of Goodyear’s meeting Crowley isunknown, this article may reflect their new acquaintance, or it may havecaptured Crowley’s notice and prompted their meeting. Regardless, Goodyear wenton to introduce the editor of Rhythm, Murry, who in December 1911 sent Mansfielda copy of Neuburg’s The Triumph of Pan to review. Her review was far fromglowing: while acknowledging that “He has something of the poet’s vision,delighting in simplicity and sensuality which is born of passionate admiration,”she dislikes his mysticism:Mysticism is perverted sensuality; it is “passionate admiration” for that whichhas no reality at all. It leads to the annhilation of any true artistic effort.It is a paraphernalia of clichés. It is a mask through which the true expressionof the poet can never be discerned. If he rejects this mask Mr. Neuburg maybecome a poet.48 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts048]Despite this review, she asked Murry for more information about the poet.Neuburg, he explained, was Crowley’s lover, but they’d quarreled and parted, andCrowley was now with some other fellow named Kennedy; Murry also referred toCrowley’s notorious works, The Daisy Chain and Snowdrops from a Curate’s Gardenas “the ne plus ultra of dirt.”49[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts049] While the facts werewrong—Crowley and Neuburg had not parted, and the first “notorious work” wasWhite Stains—Mansfield’s interest was piqued.In 1913 she and Gwen Otter cowrote a sketch called “Mimi and the Major,” thetitle characters played by Katherine and Gwen, respectively. After a performanceat the Passmore Settlement, Gwen threw one of her legendary parties, whichCrowley and Leila attended. Katherine soon found herself and the group exploringtheir inner selves while under the influence (accounts vary as to whether it washashish or Crowley’s favorite hallucinogen, Anhalonium lewinii). Accounts alsovary as to what happened next. James Laver’s account is closest to firsthand,and it is the least fantastic:“The stuff is beginning to work,” [Crowley] said. “She’s not going to beinteresting; she’s only going to sleep.”Katherine lay on the sofa and lit a cigarette. She threw the match on the floorand it lay crookedly on the carpet. This caused her such acute distress thatGwen put it straight. “That’s much better,” said K. M. “Pity that stuff had noeffect.”50 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts050]According to Laver, she babbled a bit, remarked that she could do up the buttonson her nightgown “if we talk to them very gently,” and munched some biscuits,repeating at intervals her refrain, “Pity that stuff had no effect.”Other versions say that, while her spirit rose to a “pink and paradisiacal”level, she passed the evening “arranging and rearranging with the greatestexactitude the matches from a box which she had in her hand, making patterns onthe floor.”51 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts051] Then, as shecame down, she saw “hundreds of parcels on shelves identically marked JesusWept.”52 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts052] Mansfield shortlythereafter encountered the writings of Gurdjieff and Alfred Orage, preferringthem to Crowley, whom she considered “a pretentious and very dirty fellow.”53[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts053]Obscure bits of Crowleyana trickled onto the market in this interim. The poem“Villon’s Apology” appeared in the Poetry Review at the end of 1912.54[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts054] The “Rosicrucian” Scandal, ahilarious parody of Mathers’s testimony in Jones v. The Looking Glass, appearedunder the pseudonym of Leo Vincey. The “M.M.M. Manifesto” also appeared, adornedwith photographs of Boleskine. Gwen Otter’s privately published The Writing onthe Ground included Crowley’s essay on Lord Alfred Douglas and his poem “A SlimGilt Soul” from The Winged Beetle. Finally, part two of Book Four appeared as ablue paperback, selling for four tanners, the equivalent of two shillings.On the first day of spring 1913, issue nine of The Equinox appeared. Althoughthe names of Mary d’Este Sturges and Victor Neuburg still appeared on themasthead, the only contributions not by Crowley were a couple of one-page poems,book reviews, and a sketch cowritten with Mary Desti. At 313 pages, the issuecontained no supplement and bore little magical matter: “The Temple of Solomonthe King” was brief, and the evocation of Bartzabel mostly of didactic andhistorical value. The issue’s only important magical essay was “EnergizedEnthusiasm.”Crowley dedicated plenty of space to attacking his enemies: he gleefully notedthat Looking Glass publisher de Wend Fenton was fined over £91 on six charges ofsending obscene matter through the mail; Mathers, he said, was “reduced tobeggary, his only remaining capital, his brain, in a state of hopeless decay”;and he warned students to accept no instructions from Fuller, who never advancedbeyond the grade of Probationer55[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts055] and had no authority torepresent theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg].This last warning was prompted by Crowley’s discovery that Fuller, two yearsafter their split, was still instructing Canadian disciple C. S. Jones.Meanwhile Raffalovich, who requested a printed statement that he was no longerassociated with Crowley, received this mention:Mr. George Raffalovich is in no way connected with The Equinox.Mr. George Raffalovich has never been connected with The Equinox in any way butas an occasional contributor.It cannot be too clearly understood that The Equinox has no connection with Mr.George Raffalovich.We have much pleasure in stating that Mr. George Raffalovich is in no wayconnected with The Equinox.We have no reason to anticipate that The Equinox will in any way be connectedwith Mr. George Raffalovich.We trust that Mr. George Raffalovich will be satisfied with these statements offact, to which we are prepared to testify on oath.The poem “Athanasius Contra Decanum” attacked Reverend R. St. John Parry, whohad banned Crowley from Trinity’s campus, showing “that a Dean may be damnedwithout being a liar and slanderer.” The paper “How I Became a FamousMountaineer” was a swipe at the Alpine Club, and “A Quack Painter” berated hisformer brother-in-law Gerald Kelly.He also took pleasure in publishing pieces rejected by the English Review,including “Lines to a Young Lady Violinist,” an amorous poem for Leila; thehumorous book review “A Literatooralooral Treasure-Trove”; the poems “At Sea”and “Dumb!”; his novella “Ercildoune”; and the short story “The Testament ofMagdalen Blair.”Music dominated the first months of 1913. Following her superb playing in 1910’sRites of Eleusis, Leila appeared, as noted previously, in the Ladies’ Orchestrafor A Waltz Dream. Next, she left from Liverpool on the Mauretania, arriving inNew York on March 30, 1912,56 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts056]for a stint of several weeks with the musical comedy Two Little Brides. The NewYork Times panned the show, saying that it “entirely lacks distinction” and that“faith and the best intentions in the world cannot help very much.”57[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts057] Nevertheless, it hadsixty-three performances at the Casino Theater and Lyric Theater between April23 and June 15, 1912. However, women rarely played in orchestras in 1913, andLeila, despite her skills, had trouble finding work. Crowley—no doubt inspiredby his recent friendship with music impresario Theodor Reuss—responded byassembling a troupe of seven fiddlers (three dipsomaniacs and fournymphomaniacs, by his reckoning) and dubbing them the Ragged Ragtime Girls.Leila, the only one of the group with her head on straight, was first violinist.Contrary to their name, the musicians were lithe, dressing in diaphonous gownsand playing ethereal music while dancing. Crowley described them asseven beautiful and graceful maidens who dance and play the violinssimultaneously. The strange, exotic beauty of the leader, Miss Leila Bathurst,as she weaves her dances in the labyrinthe of her attendant nymphs, thrillsevery heart with the sense alike of the rococo and the bizarre.… The weirdlyfascinating appearance of the leader, Miss Leila Bathurst, first stupefied thehouse and then roused it to a frenzy. As exotic and bizarre as her beauty is, itis yet of that royal kind which goes straight to every heart. Her paces suggestthe tiger and the snake, and her violin contains in itself all the music alikeof nature and of art. The house could not wait for the fall of the curtain torise to its feet in surging enthusiasm, and the last bars were drowned in theroars of applause that greeted the march past through the stalls. Womenshrieked, and strange men wept. Babes at the press fainted with emotion, thevery unborn emulated the execution of John the Baptist recorded in the firstchapter of the Gospel according to St. Mark.58[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts058]Crowley acted as impresario. “It was a sickening business,” he recalled.59[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts059]As early as February 1913, Crowley wrote to George M. Cowie that Leila “is goingwildly with the girls into Abyssinia, and intends to abide and rejoice.”60[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts060] The Ragged Ragtime Girlsplayed that March as part of the Easter program at the Old Tivoli, with nightlyperformances and Saturday matinees.61[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts061] The New York Times noted theprogram “is practically American,”62[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts062] specifically mentioning theRagged Ragtime Girls even though they were American-sounding in name only.George M. Cowie attended a show in Edinburgh later that year, noting,I went with a friend to see [Leila’s] performance on Friday and was greatlydelighted with it—the only artistic thing in (to me) rather a dismal programme.It struck me what a very effective thing she and these girls might make out of aWitches Sabbath dance and an Act that would probably fetch her at least doublethe money.63 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts063]In April 1913, Crowley distributed photographs and press cuttings to announcethat the Ragged Ragtime Girls were available for banquets, private engagements,and society functions. They knew immediate success, playing the London OperaHouse that month. In May, Crowley consulted Russian guidebooks and wrote toMoscow hotels for accommodations. Before long, he booked them for a summertheater engagement in Moscow.64[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts064]Before departing for Russia, AC took a break from the Ragged Ragtime Girls andOTO to relax at Eastbourne and Fontainebleau. When he returned to London, hefound everything in turmoil: John Yarker had died. This was important becauseYarker was the leading light of the Ancient and Primitive Rite of Memphis andMizraim. It was he who had authorized Reuss to operate a lodge in Germany andwho gave Crowley the 33° in his rite. Yarker’s rise to power among the variousflavors of Masonry is an interesting tale best left in Crowley’s own words:Yarker was always bothering over these questions of jurisdiction. Wishing tocontract an alliance with the Scottish Rite of France, he found that they quitenaturally objected to him having degrees beyond their own 33rd. He, therefore,agreed to reduce the Memphis Rite to 33 degrees. It was, however, rather sharppractice on his part, because in the course of reduction the Scottish 33rd wasmade equal to the 20th of the reduced Rite. The alliance was concluded, andYarker conferred the 33° on about 100 British Masons. He obtained tolerationfrom the Grand Lodge of England; toleration, not recognition, by agreeing not toadmit to the Rite any man who was not a Master Mason in good standing under theGrand Lodge of England or some body in alliance with it.You will understand from the above that the effect of Yarker’s action was to putan end, once and for all, to the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in their originalform, though whether it had been worked any time within historical periods Icannot say. I strongly doubt it.65[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts065]At the June 28 meeting to elect Yarker’s successor, Crowley objected to thepresence of James Ingall Wedgwood, Supreme Secretary to Annie Besant’sCo-Masonic Order. Although Yarker had made him an honorary Master Mason,Crowley—who opposed Besant’s TS and its “world teacher,” Krishnamurti—fearedWedgwood was there to co-opt the rite for the TS and its Co-Masonic Order.Crowley’s opposition to Co-Masonry was so great that when the French Grand Lodgehe had joined recognized Co-Masonry, AC resigned. Thus Crowley, the sole personin Ireland authorized to teach the rites of Memphis and Mizraim,66[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts066] appeared and argued that themeeting was illegal.Two days later, another meeting of members of the Sovereign Sanctuary—namelyCrowley, Reuss, Kennedy, and other Masons—elected Henry Meyer, Yarker’s ownnominee, as Grand Master General. Over the next decade, a number of people wouldsucceed him. As Crowley recorded, Meyer,whom nobody had heard of for years, appeared in the Sovereign Sanctuary to getelected, and has never been heard of. He did not answer any subsequent summons,and his death was presumed, whereupon we elected Papus, and on the death ofPapus, the Grand Master of Spain whose name I have forgotten, and after him,Reuss, who died in ’22 and I succeeded him.67[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts067]Although lineage and jurisdiction were serious matters to British Masonry,Crowley regarded such matters with disdain. “It’s all what Roosevelt would havedescribed as blah, baloney, bullshit and bunk.”68[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts068] Noncoincidentally, newlyelected Grand Hierophant Meyer named Crowley’s address at 33 Avenue Studios, 76Fulham Road in South Kensington, as headquarters of the Rite.This address was also headquarters of MMM. It foreshadowed Crowley’s plans forOTO: having approved the MMM constitution (which he wrote) on February 15, headded to the order’s Golden Book a note:In all lodges of O.T.O. and M.M.M. in Great Britain and Ireland the Volume ofthe Sacred Law shall be the book of Thelema, or a facsimile copy of Liber Legis(CCXX), and no initiations upon any other document will be recognised by theGrand Lodge.69 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts069]Liber Legis was the Latin title of The Book of the Law, and CCXX itscorresponding number. Crowley was preparing to make his philosophy of Thelema orTrue Will the official doctrine of OTO.On July 7, after paying for one thousand Ragged Ragtime Girls postcards andsending the tenth Equinox proofs to Richard Clay for printing, Crowley and theRagtime Girls caught the 2:20 for Russia. The train ride seemed interminable,proceeding day after day through endless dull pines, dun earth, and remorselessrain. The sky was “leaden, flat, featureless,” made worse by the surroundingland’s “monotony of grievous green and grey.” Nobody on the train spoke English,French, or even German.Then, one morning, he awoke as the train entered Moscow. The colors of thiswonderful city sparked him to life, and he smiled to himself. “Our hashish dreamcome true.”70 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts070]Minor complications ensued: they could locate nobody to help them find theirhotel, and they eventually managed alone. Then, late that night, Crowley andLeila received a frantic call from the other musicians: he had neglected to warnthem that in Russia, the bedbug “is as inseparable from the bed as the snail isfrom his shell.”71 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts071] After a dayor two of such minor problems, the country finally enchanted them.Standing in the capital recalled for Crowley the passion he felt for Russia overa decade earlier: back when he wanted to be an ambassador, back when he took thename Count Vladimir Svareff. As he eagerly walked the streets, he met aprostitute whom he dubbed “Olya of the broken nose.” In a café he also met aHungarian girl named Anny Ringler,tall, tense, lean as a starving leopardess, with wild, insatiable eyes and along straight thin mouth, a scarlet scar which seemed to ache with the anguishof hunger for some satisfaction beyond earth’s power to supply.72[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts072]She spoke only broken German and he faltering Russian. Despite the languagebarrier, they became passionate lovers, meeting daily. He assuaged hermasochistic tendencies, and she inspired him to write about Russia’s torturedworld.It was typical of Crowley that he should travel to Russia on so mundane apremise as being impresario to a musical troupe, yet achieve profoundinspiration and enlightenment. “During my six weeks in Moscow in 1913, I hadwhat I can only call almost continuous illumination and wrote quite a number ofmy very best poems and essays there.”73[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts073] New works flowed effortlesslyfrom his pen as he relaxed in the Aquarium Hotel or the nearby Hermitage: “TheCity of God,”74 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts074] a poemdescribing his train ride to Moscow; “The Heart of Holy Russia,”75[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts075] a prose description of Russia;“The Fun of the Fair”76 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts076] (whichhe dedicated to Anny Ringler and Olya), a description of the famous fair atNizhni Novgorod; “Morphia,” a poem about drug addiction that features adescription of Olya;77 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts077] “TheLost Continent,” a humorous story/essay on Atlantis;78[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts078] “To Laylah—Eight-and-Twenty,”a poem for the August 10 birthday of the Mother of Heaven;79[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts079] and “The Ship,” a poeticadaptation of the mysteries of Masonry. This last piece was one of Crowley’sfavorites, containing what he called the “Quia Patris,” a sublime poem to theHigher Self beginning with the words, “Thou who art I …”80[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts080] He also wrote “Hymn to Pan,”his most potent invocation:Thrill with lissome lust of the light,O man! My man!Come careering out of the nightOf Pan! Io Pan!Io Pan! Io Pan! Come over the seaFrom Sicily and from Arcady!Roaming as Bacchus, with fauns and pardsAnd nymphs and satyrs for thy guards,On a milk-white ass, come over the seaTo me, to me …81 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts081]Moved by the liturgy of St. Basil, Crowley also wrote his Gnostic CatholicMass.82 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts082] That Crowley shouldwrite such a ritual is not as unusual as it may sound, as one branch of EcclesiaGnostica Catholica, or the Gnostic Catholic Church, was connected to OTO. GerardEncausse, as one of the church’s bishops, was the link between the EGC and OTO;according to one theory, Crowley was consecrated a bishop by Reuss, who wasconsecrated by Encausse. It is an important ritual because Crowley, busy writingOTO instructions, incorporated its Great Secret openly into the Gnostic Mass,much to the ire of his fellow OTO members. He wrote, “my idea was to write aMass which would, in once sense, carry on the old tradition yet not come intoconflict with science. The whole thing, as is almost invariably the case with mywork, was written straight off in white heat and never underwent revision.”83[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts083]Although it more closely resembled the Tridentine rather than the RussianOrthodox mass, Crowley adapted the basic structure to the trappings of Thelema;hence the altar bears The Book of the Law. Its officers are the priest,priestess, deacon, and two “children.” The main focus of the rite involvesreanimation of the symbolically dead priest by the priestess, his invocationupon the priestess, and their symbolic sexual union: the priest, with his lance,advances and approaches the priestess, who is seated behind a veil; after muchceremony, the lance parts the veil, and they celebrate the mystic marriage bydepressing the lance into the grail. The deacon begins the Mass by proclaimingthe Law of Thelema, and at other points during the ceremony recites a Thelemicprofession of faith and a list of Thelemic saints, including Roger Bacon, SirEdward Kelly, Éliphas Lévi, Goethe, Wagner, Nietzsche, Carl Kellner, Sir RichardBurton, Theodor Reuss and, of course, Crowley. Despite its pretensions, theceremony itself is beautiful and moving.By the time he left Russia, AC had written about 150,000 words.Crowley returned to London early in September, a fortnight later than he hadplanned. The six hundred pages of Equinox 10 snowed him under; Leila and thetroupe had just gone to Glasgow for a two-month stint at the Theater Royale, andSpare declined to provide an illustration for the last issue. Facing thesecomplications, he invited Neuburg to help pull it together.Meanwhile, organizational upheaval rocked the MMM. Its financial records were inchaos, with several members behind in their dues. He accused the treasurer,Cremers, of misappropriating funds by using the signed checks he had left in hercare. That October, Crowley demoted her to VI° and canceled her posts as GrandSecretary General and Trustee of MMM property. Furthermore, he called her toaccount for her actions. When Cremers refused to answer the charges, a GrandTribunal met in Paris and expelled her. At this same hearing, they charged NinaHamnett with being seriously behind in her dues, R. L. Felkin for absenteeism,84[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts084] and W. C. Minchin forattempting to seduce the wife of a brother. Another member was expelled forswindling. Leila succeeded Cremers as Grand Secretary General, and George Cowiebecame Grand Treasurer General; both became cotrustees, along with Crowley, ofMMM.On the positive side, Crowley had encouraging news about his South Africanstudent, James Thomas Windram. Although his clairvoyance was so poor as toprevent his advancement to the grade of Zelator, he nevertheless excelled inother areas. When Crowley instructed him to use the Enochian system to evoke thefiery power of air, which was plentiful in his part of the world, he conjured upa storm that tore the roof from his home and struck his temple with lightning.Duly impressed, Crowley appointed him OTO’s representative for South Africa.In between crises, AC was as charming as ever, telling riveting stories of histravels to Russia. When someone asked him how one could sleep in Russia withoutbeing bothered by bedbugs, Crowley wryly replied, “Shift the frontier.” And hesent his mother a spoon with “Christ is Risen” on it to help remind her gueststo say grace. He also resumed his Sunday performances of the Mass of thePhoenix, a ritual from The Book of Lies that culminated in the Adept cutting hischest and blotting the blood with bread; socialites thought of theseperformances as nothing more than séances.85[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts085]The tenth and final issue of The Equinox, volume one, appeared that fall. If theprevious issues had been slim, this one more than compensated, featuring 223pages of material in the main body and an additional 244 in the supplement. Itcontained “In Memoriam: John Yarker,” which Crowley had previously printed anddistributed separately. It also featured the first typeset edition of The Bookof the Law, a syllabus of officialA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]instructions, “The Ship,” and a biting obituary of the still-living occultscholar A. E. Waite. The supplement—AC’s translation of Éliphas Lévi’s The Keyof the Mysteries—was supposedly superior to Waite’s translations of other worksby Lévi. Having spent his inheritance on publishing, Crowley announced thatvolume two of The Equinox would represent five years of silence to balance thefive years of speech that the first volume consumed. Publications would commencewith the third volume, due in 1919. In closing, he humorously added,It is of course common knowledge that theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]and The Equinox and all the rest of it are a stupid joke of Aleister Crowley’s.He merely wished to see if any one were fool enough to take him seriously.Several have done so, and he does not regret the few thousand pounds it has costhim.When Jacob Epstein’s (1880-1959) sculpture for the tomb of Oscar Wilde caused asensation in France that fall, Crowley found himself embroiled in thecontroversy. The Père Lachaise guardian declared the statue obscene and orderedit covered with a tarp. In response, Crowley issued a manifesto to state hisoutrage and broadcast his plans to unveil the monument:Sir,I noticed that, in obedience to the order of the prefect of Seine the OscarWilde Memorial in Pére-la-chaise has been mutilated by the placing of anenormous black butterfly over the criticized parts, thus rendering JacobEpstein’s masterpiece as ridiculous and obscene as its critics themselves. Andstill the aforesaid prefect of the Seine keeps the tarpaulin on the statue.At noon on the fifth of November, Guy Fawkes’ Day, it is my intention to proceedto Pére-la-chaise and, armed with an instrument adapted for the purpose ofcutting the cords which hold the tarpaulin in position and to cut the same.I am yours, sir,Faithfully,Aleister Crowley.86 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts086]On the eve of this confrontation, Crowley and an accomplice attached a thin,nearly invisible wire to the tarp. On November 5 his accomplice hid out ofsight, holding the end of the wire and awaiting his cue. Crowley gave a speechand, as he spoke, gesticulated toward the sculpture. As if by magic, the tarpflew off the sculpture.Following his protest, as only he could, Crowley removed the butterfly and hidit beneath his waistcoat, slipping from the cemetery portlier than when heentered. Reaching London, Crowley put on his evening suit and strolled into theCafé Royal wearing the butterfly as a codpiece.The end of 1913 favored Crowley with a small spate of recognition: his critiqueof United States culture, “Art in America,” appeared in the November EnglishReview. Its premise was that Americans, despite the inspiring qualities of theirnation, are uninspired; with few exceptions, America has spawned no greatartists, poets, writers, actresses, dancers, musicians, or scientists. TheLondon Times called it “An entirely preposterous, but quite enjoyable, tirade,”while the Academy predicted it would “set all Americans … hot on his trail withloaded revolvers.” The article garnered attention in the American press such asthe Chicago Daily Tribune and The State, the latter conceding that “its authorreveals a wider reading of American literature than most natives can claim.”87[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts087] Ten years later in the EnglishReview, American poet Robert Haven Schauffler (1879–1964) reflected on Crowley,“His article is most readable. It bristles with wit and wisdom—and the wildestunsportsmanship.”88 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts088] TheYorkshire Herald put the debate into perspective by asking who had ever heard ofAleister Crowley.Meanwhile, the anthology Cambridge Poets, 1900–13 reproduced the followingselections from Crowley’s works: “In Neville’s Court,” “On Garrett HostelBridge,” “The Goad,” “The Rosicrucian,” “Song,” “In Memoriam A. J. B.” [Ada JaneBishop], “The Challenge,” “Two Hymns on the Feast of the Nativity,” “The Palaceof the World,” and “Perdurabo.” It also included seven pieces by Victor Neuburgand G. H. S. Pinsent’s “The Organ in King’s Chapel, Cambridge” from The Equinox.89 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts089] The collection was wellreceived, although J. DeLancey Ferguson complained in his review for The DialthatOnly rarely—notably in Aleister Crowley’s “The Quest,” every stanza of whichrequires at least one footnote to explain its symbolic meaning—do we feel thatthe poet is overdoing the thing. The true mystic can make his vision plainwithout footnotes.90 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts090]The volume’s editor, Aelfrida Catherine Wetenhall Tillyard (1883–1959), was thedaughter of the former mayor of Cambridge, Alfred Isaac Tillyard; a formerSunday School teacher; an aspiring writer of poetry and children’s works; andwife of King’s College undergraduate Constantine Graham. She had becomeinterested in comparative mysticism before age twenty and by 1904 referred toher “thirst for mysticism,” which was heightened by the experiences of beingnursed at a convent in 1905 and having a stillbirth in 1912.91[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts091] She discovered Crowley whileresearching her anthology, writing in her diary for April 26,I have discovered one genius for my book—Aleister Crowley, Victor Neuburg’s“master.” There are odd legends about him … But his poetry is marvelous, greatfloods of it, mystic or sensual or singing or majestic—and once in a waydownright beastly.92 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts092]Thus, she became a student, reading part one of Book Four; Crowley soon sent herpart two, the first nine issues of The Equinox and 777, and began addressing herin letters as “Soror Sarasvati.”93[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts093] She considered him “a greatreligious genius”94 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts094] andreferred to him as her “guru.” However, the relationship ended that Novemberafter her husband, Constantine, met “Count and Countess MacGregor” at theconsulate in Paris and received an earful about his wife’s spiritual master; acontrolling and physically abusive husband, he insisted that Tillyard break offcommunications with “the devil incarnate”95[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts095] because he was having too muchof an influence on her.Another Crowley publication, “The City of God,” was slated to appear as the leadpiece in the January 1914 English Review. Of this poem, the Manchester Guardianwould write, “Mr. Crowley is an expert in the portentous, a collector ofclanging, menacing phrases; we are a little doubtful about it all and disposedto seek for relief in Anthony Trollope or Jane Austen.”96[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts096]The MMM was back on its feet, his works were recognized, and he was in Pariswith Neuburg: these circumstances again inspired Crowley. His Canadian student,Charles Stansfeld Jones—who had advanced to Neophyte earlier that year and takenthe motto of Achad (One, unity)—passed to the grade of Zelator on New Year’s Eveand was eager to set up theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]in Vancouver. All were good portents.Realizing they were on the verge of the six hundredth anniversary of theimmolation of Knights Templar Grand Master Jacques de Molay, AC decided it washis duty to experiment with the secret of the IX°.Walter Duranty (1884–1957) had just become a foreign correspondent for the NewYork Times. An understated five-foot-six in height, what he lacked in comelinesshe made up for in brilliant wit and raconteur’s skill. Duranty hailed from anaffluent British family and was educated at the prestigious Harrow and Eatonschools, graduating in 1903 near the top of his class. His forte lay intranslating into other languages, particularly French, and he routinelyastonished his fellow correspondents by taking any local newspaper and recitinga perfect French, Latin, or Greek translation on the fly.Years would pass before he would be acclaimed for his coverage of both World WarI and the rise of Joseph Stalin. Over a decade would pass before a train crashclaimed his leg, and nearly a score before his poem “Red Square” appeared withthe famous words, “you can’t make an omelette without breaking eggs.” InDecember 1913, Wally, as AC called him, was still a green journalist, sharingwith Crowley the affections and opium of their mutual lover, Jane Chéron.Crowley had devised a ritual amalgamating “Liber Pyramidos,” the Goetia, “TheShip,” and IX° sex magick to invoke the gods Mercury and Jupiter. It began withCrowley invoking Thoth, the Egyptian Mercury, as he had in Cairo. He proceededwith constructing the pyramid à la “Liber Pyramidos” and reciting conjurationsfrom the Goetia and his own works. Then, at the stroke of midnight, Crowley andNeuburg rang in the new year with sex intended to invoke Mercury. Crowleyassumed the passive role, and both chanted the versicle which Duranty hadtranslated into Latin:Jungitur in vati vates: rex inclyte rabdouHermes tu venias, verba nefanda ferens.(“Seer is joined with seer: Renowned king of the wand, come thou, Hermes,bearing the ineffable word.”) As they proceeded, the room, in Crowley’s eyes,filled with thousands of golden caducei, their entwined serpents writhinganimatedly. Victor, manifesting the god, became giddy and childish. It remindedCrowley of the description in the Thelemic Holy Book “Liber Ararita”: “Thou hastappeared to me as a young boy mischievous and lovely, with Thy winged globe andits serpents set upon a staff.”In the end, either the mischievous, childlike nature of young Hermes or thesilly giddiness of Brother Lampada Tradam (Neuburg) prevented the active partnerfrom reaching orgasm. The god could not take control and be questioned, and thefirst working ended at 1:40 a.m., disappointing yet promising.Such began Crowley’s first systematic experiments in sex magick, encompassingtwenty-four workings over the next six weeks.Crowley spent New Year’s Day 1914 forming a phallic figure of Hermes out ofyellow wax. Erecting it in the east that evening, the second working began at11:20 p.m. Owing to poor performance in the first working, the magicians agreedto avoid distraction during sex by eschewing the Latin versicle. Just beforemidnight, after Neuburg climaxed, they commenced the chant, and Hermes tookpossession. The god appeared in this working not as a child but as a messenger,robust in body with caduceus and talaria. Although Victor initially lost controland began scrawling in the record, Crowley eventually initiated a properdialogue. “Are we working right?” he asked the god.“No,” Hermes informed him.“What’s wrong?”“The time, and, to a lesser extent, the place.”“What is the right time?”“Three hours before dawn.”“Does this apply to Mercury alone, or to all the gods?”“To Mercury alone.”“Are we to invoke Mercury again?”“Yes.”“Tomorrow?”“No.”“When, then?”“On the day of the full moon.”“What god shall we invoke tomorrow?”“Thoth.”“But Thoth is Mercury!”“You will get another aspect.”“Shall we not use the same versicle?”“It does not matter.”“Shall I make statues of all the gods?”“No.”“Shall I make tablets of all the gods?”“Yes.”“What tablets?”“Tablets with the names only.”“In what order shall we invoke the gods?”“The proper order is Venus, Mercury, Jupiter, Luna, Sol.”“Will he help in geomancy?”“Yes.” As a god of magic, Mercury should help in divination.“And also in the conduct of affairs?”“In some, not in all.”“In business?”“In some business.” Again, appropriate for the god of commerce.“What?”“Books, money, love.” This prediction, Crowley noted at the conclusion of theworkings, definitely came true.“How can we invoke Mercury better?”“Use a golden pentagram, placing the same in a prominent position; drink yellowwine and eat fish before the ceremony. Let the clock be removed.”“Can you suggest any improvements in the ceremonies, especially that ofJupiter?”“Scarlet and silver should be worn, and the crown OSV. LT is to wear the scarletrobe, violets are to be strewn and trodden with bare feet.” OSV was Crowley’sAdeptus Major motto, while LT referred to Neuburg as Zelator.At this point, Victor asked, “Shall I let him take full possession now?”Satisfied that the entity they had conjured was, in fact, the god Hermes, andthat it was safe to allow him to take control of Neuburg’s body, Crowley agreed.“I am going.” Victor paused, handing himself over to Hermes, who took over theconversation. “What do you want to know now? There are other things I can tellyou, or else ask me questions.”“Tell,” Crowley replied curtly.“You will receive good news in respect of money on the eleventh of January, inthe forenoon. Frater LT will be concerned with it; it will be quite unexpected.Money will be given by someone to whom LT introduced OSV. A change in OSV’saffairs in February.” These predictions all came true by the end of the working,when Crowley, whose fortune was depleted by this point, saw his financesimprove.“I am going to ask a very important question. Concentrate hard. N.C.G.M.H.D.”Crowley was asking in code when he would attain the grade of Magus (9°=2°), intheA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg].The god computed. “L is 50, and P is 6.”“Fifty-six what?”“I don’t know … Wait … Hours? I am not quite sure, but it is connected withtime.” It was remarkable enough that Neuburg, or whatever was answering, knewthe question concerned time. Even more startling is the fact that the timebetween Crowley’s formal induction as a Magister Templi (8°=3°) on December 3,1909, and his reaching the grade of Magus on October 12, 1915, would be sixyears less fifty days.The magicians next switched roles, with Crowley channeling Hermes and Neuburgasking the questions. Crowley launched into a discourse on the nature of Mercuryand a comment on the Gospel of John, chapter one, which begins “In the beginningwas the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” Crowley, asHermes, spoke, “In the Beginning was the Word, the Logos, who is Mercury, and istherefore to be identified with Christ. Both are messengers; theirbirth-mysteries are similar; the pranks of their childhood are similar. In theVision of the Universal Mercury, Hermes is seen descending upon the sea, whichrefers to Mary. The Crucifixion represents the Caduceus; the two thieves, thetwo serpents; the cliff in the vision of the Universal Mercury is Golgotha;Maria is simply Maia with the solar R in her womb.” This discussion and visionwent on until they closed the temple at 2 a.m.The third working commenced on January 3. Crowley and Neuburg began the ceremonyaround midnight, but could not be sure since, per Hermes’s instructions, theclock was gone. Around 1 a.m., they completed the “Quia Patris” and Hermesappeared. In this manifestation, Neuburg saw him as essentially phallic, bearingin his hand the Book II, subtitled BIA, whose 106 pages referred to the grade ofAdeptus Exemptus (7°=4°). BIA, in Greek, meant force, might, or strength.“Every drop of semen which Hermes sheds is a world,” Neuburg explained. “Thetechnical term for this semen is KRATOS.” This Greek word, also meaning force,differed from BIA in that the former corresponded to the kabbalistic Boaz whileKRATOS equated with Jachin: opposite pillars in Solomon’s temple. Numerically,both words added up to be prime numbers, BIA 13 and KRATOS 691; together theywere 704, an important number in the Christian gematria of Bond and Lea.97[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts097]The discourse proceeded at length, finally providing instructions on theworkings. “He wants us not to invoke the other forms of Mercury,” Neuburg spoke.“He says that we have more knowledge than we know what to do with.”Regarding the rite of Jupiter, they learned banquets were not only in order forthe ceremony, but that results depended on them. Therefore, they should beprepared carefully. In addition, Neuburg added, “He wants us to overcome shamegenerally, and says, ‘There is no shame about me, is there?’ He suggests anobvious method which I blush to repeat.”At 2:15 a.m., the third working ended.Since the gods insisted on overcoming shame, they followed their suggestion:Crowley and Neuburg called on Jane Chéron and there engaged Duranty in an act ofpublic sodomy. As Crowley noted, “W.D. was the victim”—i.e., he played thepassive role—but AC neglected to record the aggressor’s identity. It was morelikely the shy Neuburg, who had more shame to overcome, than Crowley, whopreferred the passive role.Crowley had a cold and Neuburg a temper when they did the fourth working onJanuary 5. Because of this, Crowley described the rites as “maimed.”Nevertheless, he became oracular and interacted in the guise of Hermes withNeuburg. After closing the temple, however, Neuburg became possessed bysomething else and began to speak. The entity warned that they were unleashingan enormous magical force that would result in international complications. Thiswould prove significant as World War I began only months afterward. “Those whoadopt this rite will either succeed completely or fail utterly. There is nomiddle path for it is impossible to escape the ring of Divine Karma created.”The entity next described what it considered a most potent ritual: “The supremeRite would be to bring about a climax in the death of the victim.” The victimhad to be willing, and was ideally a young girl. Hearing details on the rape,sacrifice, and vivisection of the “offering,” Crowley was horrified. Both he andNeuburg agreed the directions involved black magic and should be ignored.The entity went on to make predictions about the magicians. Neuburg, he said,would travel east, marry in June, and return to the Great Work in September;none of these predictions came to pass. For Crowley, he saw a long journey tothe east, during which he would leave Neuburg in charge of his affairs. Inretrospect, this erroneous prediction would amuse Crowley as, shortly after thisParis Working, he and Neuburg would split and Crowley would journey west, noteast, to America for the duration of the war.Unimpressed, Crowley closed the temple on the fourth working.At about this time, Wally and Jane appeared with the remedy to Crowley’s cold:an opium pipe. While the drug would prove harmfully habit-forming for hisfriends, Crowley recognized opium as sacred to Jupiter, the deity he was tryingto contact. Taking this as a sign, he partook. Afterward, he took a nap.Upon awakening, not only had his cold cleared up, but he was also inspired towrite a story. Crowley’s “Kubla Kahn,” “The Stratagem,” came to him in full formas a “subtle exposure of English stupidity.”98[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts098] The English Review wouldaccept it straight off, and Joseph Conrad would reputedly consider it the bestshort story he had read in ten years.From January 6 through 11, four more workings occurred, the first three ofJupiter and the fourth of Hermes. Then Neuburg took a week off to go to theforest and recuperate from an illness. The Paris Working resumed on January 19.Six more workings occurred up to the 27th, all invoking Jupiter. In these rites,they recalled past lives, including one as a priestess named Asteria or Astarte,recalling the great sacrifice of spring, wherein a bull was cut open and avirgin, laid inside the hot carcass, was violated by the High Priest as shechoked on blood in orgasm.Crowley and Neuburg shared an incarnation, they learned: as Mardocles, anaspirant for initiation, Neuburg’s ordeal was to watch the temple dancer Aia(Crowley) without becoming aroused; if he did, he was to rape her or facecastration. Mardocles, aroused by the dance, was moved by tenderness not toviolate her. Favoring the candidate, the high priest spared him castration butexpelled both he and Aia from the temple. The saga of Crowley and Neuburg aslovers in a past life unfolds from there. Taken as a spate of fantasy orwish-fulfillment, it illustrates their love for each other; accepted as truth,it explains why they were drawn together in this life with such compatiblesexual styles.When the temple opened at 10:20 on January 29 for the sixteenth working, Jupiterdemanded blood. Crowley compliantly cut a four (the number of Jupiter) onNeuburg’s breast. Afterward, AC sat in the yogic posture Shivasana while Victordanced. Crowley experienced a most complete possession of his person by the god,wrapping his consciousness into the godhead so intensely that the onlyappropriate expression he could arrive at was “Sanguis and Semen”: Jupiter’senergy flowed through the staple fluids of life, “blood and semen.” Furtherworkings followed on February 2, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, and 12.After twenty-four operations, the Paris Working finished with Neuburg’sbibliomancy, “I am Thou, and the Pillar is established in the Void.” Hermes hadpromised money: long-overdue checks arrived in the mail, and a Brother donated£500 of his recent inheritance to the order. Hermes promised to help with books:and Crowley’s newest, Chicago May, was back from the printers; while in Tunisiaon May 14, he would be inspired to write “The Soul of the Desert.”99[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts099] Jupiter promised health andhospitality: Crowley found his bronchitis cured, and friends offering him opium,the drug sacred to Jupiter, while Neuburg found himself flooded with dinnerguests and hosts. Crowley and Neuburg considered the rituals an unqualifiedsuccess.100 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts100]Another important result of these workings was their effect on Crowley’sconceptualization of the OTO mysteries. While the VIII° dealt with masturbatorymagick and IX° with vaginal intercourse, he saw no room for homosexual workings.Crowley found that his “researches into the mysteries of the IX° have compelledme to add an XI°.”101 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts101] Althoughit remains an obscure part of Crowley’s system, the XI° represented a symbolicreversal of IX°: Just as the digits were reversed, so were the energiesinverted.Duranty, meanwhile, remained close with the opium-wracked Chéron, taking her ashis wife for many years. However, after Crowley and Neuburg returned to Paris,he found he no longer believed in anything. On Crowley, he commented, “I don’tbelieve in magic, but I’m not sure that I disbelieve it. But wouldn’t it befunny if all the magicians went to heaven?”102[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts102]Finding his finances more and more overextended, Crowley protected himself fromcreditors by selling Boleskine and its thirty-four-acre parcel to the trusteesof MMM (namely, himself, Leila, and Cowie). On May 5, the MMM paid £500 toCrowley and assumed £900 in debts and bills on the property. In order to protecthis intellectual property, Crowley transferred the copyrights of all his worksto OTO as well. In theory (but not, as it turns out, in practice), all ofCrowley’s possessions and works were now owned by OTO, and hence inaccessible tocreditors.103 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts103]The English Review’s August publication of Crowley’s “Chants Before Battle” wasparticularly well-timed, coinciding with the start of World War I. The piece,leading off the issue, integrates into classic selections of poetry the gist ofthe linesWe don’t want to fight, but, by Jingo, if we do,We’ve got the ships, we’ve got the men, we’ve got the money, too.Some of the authors subjected to this clever and humorous mutation are GeoffreyChaucer, Alfred Lord Tennyson, Robert Browning, Percy Bysshe Shelly, FrancisThompson, and D. G. Rosetti. It remains one of Crowley’s greatest bits ofliterary parody.Also contributing to Crowley’s high public profile at this time was hisintroduction, through Frank Harris, to the “tramp poet” Harry Kemp (1883–1960).Attending one of Crowley’s performances of the Mass of the Phoenix (or “séances”as they were popularly dubbed), Kemp wrote an article—which Crowley consideredrubbish and Kemp himself called “a turgid bit of sensational journalism”104[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts104]—for the New York World’sSunday magazine of August 2, 1914. The title said it all: “Weird Rites of DevilWorshippers Revealed by an Eye Witness.” Despite whatever virtues the piece mayhave lacked, it did stir up interest in the United States. As Crowley noted, “wehave had a lot of letters from America on account of a lunatic’s article in theNew York World.”[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_049_r1.jpg]“Tramp Poet” Harry Kemp (1883–1960), who helped introduce Crowley to America.(photo credit 11.4) [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c11-fig004a]Early in September, Crowley renewed his experiments in the IX° with Leila.Although he penned official OTO instructions on sex magick—“De Arte Magica,” “DeNuptiis Secretis Deorum Cum Hominibus,” and “De Homunculo Epistola”—they wereobsolete even as they appeared. As Crowley wrote at this time, “My knowledge ofthe technique has largely increased since I wrote my Commentary on the IX°.”105[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts105]While Crowley busied himself with writings and “séances,” Neuburg began tomaintain his distance. Although business kept them apart, Neuburg also tired ofthe fits of anger to which he, as AC’s lover, had become subject. After aviolent row between Crowley and Hayter Preston that past May, Neuburg tookPreston’s advice and went away for the summer to a cottage in Branscombe, SouthDevon. There, his close friends were Crowley’s former students Olivia Haddon andVittoria Cremers; to them, Crowley was an impostor and charlatan, and they madeVictor see him in a new light. Unfortunately, they also led Neuburg to thefar-fetched belief that Crowley had jealously caused Jeanne Heyse’s suicide. Apassage he would read years later in Magick in Theory and Practice would onlyconfirm Victor’s suspicions:An adept known to The Master Therion once found it necessary to slay a Circe whowas bewitching brethren. He merely walked to the door of her room, and drew anAstral T (“traditore,” and the symbol of Saturn) with an astral dagger. Within48 hours she shot herself.106 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts106]This passage was likely a case of Crowley, having heard the allegations againsthim, recounting the story in a way that bolstered his magical image.When Neuburg faced Crowley that fall, tendering his resignation and renouncingall his oaths, the master ritually cursed him on the spot. Neuburg was toostunned to do anything but stand there. Three years previously, almostprophetically, Neuburg had written to Crowley in The Triumph of Pan:Because the fulfilment of dreams is itself but a dream,There is no end save the song, and song is the end;And here with a sheaf of songs barehanded I stand,And the light is fled from mine eyes, and the sword from my handIs fallen; the years have left me a fool, and the gleamIs vanished from life, and the swift years sear me and rend.107[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts107]Neuburg would never again write poetry as moving as that he wrote underCrowley’s influence, although he would go on to run the Vine Press and edit “ThePoet’s Corner” for the Sunday Referee. Through this column, which awarded weeklyprizes to promising new talents, Neuburg would discover Welsh poet Dylan Thomas(1914–1953).108 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c11-nts108] Up until hisdeath from tuberculosis in 1940, Neuburg would recall his days with Crowley witha combination of tenderness and pain. It was the end of an era for both of them."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWELVECHOKMAH DAYSCrowley’s life began to progress in episodic cycles lasting seventy-three days.These he dubbed Chokmah days, after the Tree of Life’s second sphere,numerically valued seventy-three and representing the grade of Magus to which heaspired.Day one.News of the Great War arrived while Crowley was climbing in Switzerland toprepare for a £40,000 rematch with Kangchenjunga. As he wrote:I came down from a mountain to find the Swiss had mobilized and all the railwaysheld up, but on the first day possible I went to Berne, where the Britishminister informed me it was impossible to get back, that the line had been tornup for 13 miles beyond the frontier, and that he could not get his own menthrough. Reduced to desperation, I consequently took the train and came homewithout any difficulty.1 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts001]The world had never seen fighting on so a large scale. While Neuburg—prior tohis parting with Crowley—suggested it was a sign of the Reign of Horus, Crowleywas “hoping it will be over in two or three months.”2[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts002] Nevertheless he dutifullyoffered to help with the war effort; but his assistance was unwanted. Whetherdue to age (thirty-nine), health, or notoriety, Crowley does not say.However, we do know that a severe attack of phlebitis in his left legincapacitated Crowley from September to mid-October. As he recuperated, hevisited Boleskine one last time. His spent fortune required him to liquidateeven this: since going over to MMM, Boleskine was mortgaged to raise funds forthe Great Work and rented to Dr. Murray Leslie for £250 a year in order to paythe bank. In his final visit to his former home, Crowley worried about the war.He confided in C. S. Jones that, if the end of civilization was coming, heshould share the secret of the IX° with several persons to ensure its survival.In a separate letter to MMM’s treasurer, he wrote, “Unfortunately this Secret isin possession of very few, and it is quite conceivable that all the holdersmight perish within the next year or two. A part of the instruction of the IX°is in these words: “Trust not a stranger; fail not an heir.’ ”3[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts003] The task of finding competentand capable people to carry on the mysteries would worry and motivate Crowleyeven in his last days.Everywhere he looked, it seemed the propaganda of Lord Northcliffe (AlfredHarmsworth, 1865–1922) presented itself. A newspaper magnate and politician,Northcliffe is remembered as England’s William Randolph Hearst. For years he hadbeen publishing articles in his newspapers such as the Daily Mail, warning aboutthe threats to Britain’s sovereignty posed by the airplane and by Germany’spolitics. When the war finally broke out, the Star wrote, “Next to the Kaiser,Lord Northcliffe has done more than any living man to bring about the war.”4[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts004] Northcliffe’s propagandadisgusted Crowley. To smash Wagner records and ban Father Christmas because oftheir German roots simply made England look ridiculous. Seeing England’s ownefforts reflect poorly on itself, it occurred to him that an unprincipled orclever man could easily use a nation’s propaganda as a weapon against itself.The idea fascinated him.This jumble of ideas played in Crowley’s mind: finances; preservation of the IX°secret; rejection by a homeland that was embarrassing itself with its awkwardpropaganda. In the midst of the crisis, everything pointed to America.Kemp’s article in the New York World magazine helped pave the way, followed bythe republication of “Appeal to the American Republic” in the October EnglishReview as “To America.” New York lawyer and patron of the arts John Quinn(1870–1924) had collected most of Crowley’s books (but read none of them). Heknew “some of them seemed to be the limit, both erotic and blasphemous. I canforgive the blasphemy.”5 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts005] Hewished to buy Crowley’s rare editions, and the desperate author shipped twotrunks of rariora—special bindings, manuscripts, and the like—to the States.Valued at $20,000, Crowley hoped to sell at least $5,000.In addition, C. S. Jones had collected signatures in Vancouver that October tofound an OTO lodge. Reuss granted him a charter, and Crowley took him under hiswing. Thus another pupil and friend stepped into the space vacated by Neuburg,Fuller, the other Jones, and Eckenstein.On October 24 Crowley sailed for America on the Lusitania, six months beforeGerman U-boats would sink it and 1,198 passengers, drawing the United Statesinto the war.For the third time in fourteen years, Crowley set foot on American soil. Hearrived in New York on November 1 with $200 in his pocket and his wax-papercharter as Honorary Magus of the Societas Rosicruciana. On his fingers werevarious magical rings, and in his vest hung a pocket watch bearing the emblem ofa 33° Freemason. Henry Hall, a reporter from the New York World Sunday magazine,met him at the dock, following up the account of London “devil-worshippers” witha description of Aleister Crowley’s arrival (it appeared in the December 13issue, and was syndicated nationally):Aleister Crowley, who recently arrived in New York, is the strangest man I evermet. He is a man about whom men quarrel. Intensely magnetic, he attracts peopleor repels them with equal violence. His personality seems to breed rumors.Everywhere they follow him.One man to whom I spoke of him lauded Crowley as a poet of rare delicacy, theauthor of “Hail Mary,” a garland of verses in honor of the Mother of God.Another alluded to him as an unsparing critic of American literature. Anotherknew him as the holder of some world records for mountain-climbing. Stillanother warned me against him as a thoroughly bad man, a Satanist ordevil-worshiper steeped in black magic, the high priest of Beelzebub. An actorknew of him only as a theatrical producer and as the designer of extraordinarystage costumes. A publisher told me that Crowley was an essayist and philosopherwhose books, nearly all privately issued, were masterpieces of modern printing.…By others he was variously pictured to me as a big game hunter, as a gambler, asan editor, as an explorer. Some said that he was a man of real attainments,others that he was a faker. All agreed that he was extraordinary.6[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts006]The account was far more accurate than Kemp’s sensationalism.Seizing on the publicity, Crowley issued a pamphlet announcing “The Master willremain in New York until the end of January.” During his stay, he was offering aseries of classes on world religions, divination, and magic. The lattercurriculum is most interesting: although he hadn’t yet adopted his idiosyncraticspelling of magick, the outline is virtually identical with the table ofcontents to Magick in Theory and Practice (1929), which at this point onlyexisted as the first draft of Book Four, Part Three. This shows how little thestructure of the book changed between its original draft, completed with LeilaWaddell in Fontainebleau in 1912; its revision with Mary Butts in Cefalù in1921–1922; and its final revision and publication with Gerald Yorke in 1929.The class series was at one stage connected to George Winslow Plummer(1876–1944), Supreme Magus of the Societas Rosicruciana in America.7[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts007] Plummer was born in Boston butmoved to New York City to work as an artist; there, his encounter withFreemasonry prompted him, together with Sylvester C. Gould (1840–1909), to formthe Societas Rosicruciana in America, which would be open to Masons andnon-Masons alike. Gould’s death in 1909 left Plummer the sole executive of theorder while it was still in its formative stages. As early as 1912, Plummer hadbeen in touch with Crowley’s circle through The Equinox. By early 1913, both menhad reciprocated recognition of each other, Crowley inscribing Plummer’s name inMMM’s Golden Book as a 32° Scottish Rite Mason, and Plummer forwarding Crowleyan SRIA IX° diploma in Honoris Causa. On arriving in New York on November 1, oneof the first things Crowley did was to write Plummer in order to meet andpersonally present him with a certificate recognizing him as an honorary Princeof the Royal Secret in OTO. The SRIA minute book for November 13, 1914, recordsthat Plummer had a “satisfactory interview” with Crowley.8[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts008] A four-page card produced atthis time, advertising a series of talks very similar in structure to the onedescribed above, listed a New York City address for G. W. Plummer. The level ofPlummer’s involvement, however, is unclear; he may simply have been providing amailing address or a classroom.AC found America unrecognizable, with its skyscrapers, capitalists, and bustlemore distasteful than ever. Although he found accommodations at the HotelWolcott on 4 West 31st Street (today known as one of New York’s great bargainhotels), he wound up at 40 West 36th Street. From there, he looked up friendsand acquaintances: Frank Harris recalled how Crowley arrived at his St. RegisHotel room looking “more like an Egyptian than ever”9[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts009] and still suffering fromphlebitis. Harris had worked with Crowley in the past, through both Vanity Fairand The Equinox; he was now editor for Pearson’s magazine. Angered that theworld treated poets like stray dogs, Harris treated Crowley kindly and providedhim with introductions to many New Yorkers, including journalist William BuehlerSeabrook (1886–1945)10 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts010] and theman who would become Crowley’s lifelong friend, writer and biographer LouisUmfreville Wilkinson (1881–1966), better known by his pen name Louis Marlow.When Crowley called, John Quinn invited him to dinner. Crowley asked permissionto reproduce the Augustus John pencil sketch of him that Quinn owned; since Johnhimself had asked Quinn for copies, he agreed to have prints made for both Johnand Crowley. AC also helped Quinn select Crowleyana to purchase for his library.These included one of ten Japanese vellum copies of Jezebel and Other TragicPoems, fine bindings of The Sword of Song and Konx Om Pax in blue crushed levantmorocco by the master bookbinder Zaehnsdorf,11[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts11] and the original manuscripts ofThe Soul of Osiris, The Mother’s Tragedy, and Alice: An Adultery, all bound byZaehnsdorf. The latter book contained a verse in “White Poppy” that thepublished edition omitted. In the end—on November 14—Crowley, hoping to exchangehis cache of books for cash in hand, was sadly disappointed. Quinn bought only$700 worth of books. It hardly justified the transatlantic journey.Crowley repeatedly offered dinner to Quinn, who always declined. Realizing thatCrowley was hard up, and feeling charitable with the holiday season approaching,Quinn finally invited Crowley to his apartment for a mid-December Christmasdinner. He arrived in good spirits and presented Quinn with a gift of amanuscript. It was “The King of Terrors,” published in The Equinox as “TheTestament of Magdalen Blair.” Its ninety pages were bound in limp crimsonmorocco with a cloth solander case. Crowley inscribed it, “To John Quinn the MSof my best story (so far). Christmas 1914, a tiny tribute from AleisterCrowley.”12 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts012]Ironically, another of Quinn’s dinner guests was John Butler Yeats (1839–1922),the talented father of Crowley’s GD rival, W. B. Yeats. The elder Yeats, who wasgiving lectures in America, also brought former school teacher Dorothy Coates,his tall brunette mistress. Formerly Quinn’s lover, she came between Quinn andYeats, and only her recent affliction with tuberculosis prompted the two men toreconcile. Also attending was Frederic James Gregg (1865-1928), Quinn’s goodfriend who left his journalistic job at the Sun to become one of Vanity Fair’smain contributors.A skilled and witty raconteur, Crowley dominated the conversation, recountingthe history of the manuscript he had just given Quinn: he wrote the short story“The Testament of Magdalen Blair,” originally titled “The King of Terrors,” inNovember 1912. Having read it at a party one Christmas Eve, he shocked theguests so that, the next morning, he learned they all now disliked him. Hesubmitted it pseudonymously to the English Review and to his astonishment,editor Austin Harrison (1873–1928), believing the story to be true, demandedauthentication.Then Crowley entertained everyone with his best party stunt: guessing, withremarkable accuracy, the birth date, hour, and rising sign of those present.When the conversation turned to the GD, an organization dear to W. B. Yeats,John Butler Yeats and Dorothy Coates questioned him: yes, he opposed Mathers,and was indignant about his alleged mistreatment of Moïna. All the while, he wascourteous and well spoken. “Of course,” Yeats recalled, “being an Englishman, hewas throughout the hero of his own tales.”13[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts013] Yeats liked Crowley, anddescribed the evening favorably in a letter to his son, “Willie”:Do you know a man named Crowley?—a strange man and witty. Miss Coates and I methim at Quinn’s at dinner; his conversation not witty but that of a witty man.…Have you noticed that any man possessing the gift of expression but absolutelywithout sympathy is inevitably a wit and a man of humour? A complete detachmentfrom the people about him—this complete and perfectly natural estrangement putshim in easy possession of all that makes for humor and wit. It also makes himseem formidable. The combination is that of the formidable stranger, so that youpay attention to every word he lets fall from his lips. And if he makes youlaugh, you hear him with a sense of relief and are almost grateful, this effectenhanced in this case by his bullet head and strong clumsy figure—his fingersthick but tapering.… Have you noticed that one is always inclined to like aformidable man? It is our way of getting back our courage.14[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts014]Quinn, however, decided the poet was simply not his type. Magick bored him, andtheir conversation left him thinking Crowley a dull, uninteresting speaker.Despite Crowley’s reputation, Quinn found nothing objectionable about himexcept, perhaps, for his “strong appetite for strong drink.” Quinn had suppliedvintage Chartreuse and cigars to his guests, and Crowley consumed a good amount,although never becoming drunk. “I am not interested in his morals or lack ofmorals,” he wrote. “He may or may not be a good or profound or crooked studentor practitioner of magic. To me, he is only a third—or fourth—rate poet.”15[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts015]Gregg’s opinion of Crowley is unknown, but he appears to have played a role inintroducing Crowley to Vanity Fair, for Crowley’s works soon began to appearregularly in the New York edition just as they did in the London edition. Theseevents, however, did not unfold until Crowley’s fifth Chokmah day.When W. B. Yeats learned that his father and Quinn had entertained Crowley forChristmas, he sent warnings to both. To his father, Yeats wrote:Crowley is not a man I appreciate. I am amused to find that he now praises Mrs.MacGregor, he slandered her in a very cruel way in one of his books but Isuppose Bergson’s sister is now worth considering. I am sorry Quinn has taken upwith Crowley.16 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts016]Yeats was even more blunt with Quinn:He is I think mad, but has written about six lines, amid much bad rhetoric, ofreal poetry. I asked about him at Cambridge, and a man described him beingdragged out of the dining hall by a porter, thrown out, struggling, because ofthe indecency of his conversation. He is an English and French type. You I thinkhave nothing like him. He used to be a handsome fellow.17[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts017]Quinn assured the younger Yeats that he was no friend of Crowley’s and had seenhim only three or four times in all. Unknown to Crowley, a ghost from his pastkept him out of Quinn’s graces.Another moneymaking scheme was meanwhile in the works. Crowley contacted lawyerTheodore Schroeder (1864–1953), whose writings on sex and religion attractedAC’s attention. Crowley sent him a copy of the Bagh-i-Muattar, emphasizing,When you’re done with it, you can walk straight down to Brentano’s [Book Store]and get your money back. It’s very very rare: Only 200 copies printed, many ofthese destroyed, and the bulk of the stock probably lost.…18[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts018]The book, however, was merely bait. Crowley offered to send Schroeder OTO’ssecret documents at a deal too good to pass up: without the ceremonies, he couldtake a vow of secrecy and receive the instructions as an honorary VII° attwo-thirds the price.Such were Crowley’s first days in America, financially depleted anddisappointed. As he generated spare funds, he spent them on continuedexperiments in sex magick. Although Leila was with him around this time, Crowleyconfined his work to cheap prostitutes and masturbation.Day two.Despite the war, financial hardship, and distance from England, the Great Workproceeded. Cowie was doing his best as Grand Treasurer General of MMM to sendCrowley £50–100 at regular intervals. Furthermore, Frank Bennett, theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]student who left for Australia and the TS around 1911, recontacted MMM afterthree years of running a Theosophical lodge; he wanted to work the OTO ritualsin Australia. Windram, Crowley’s man in South Africa, worked with Bennett andErnest W. T. Dunn, 33°, to set up an OTO lodge down under, with Bennett asNational Grand Secretary General and Dunn the reluctant Grand Master General.This arrangement placed Crowley in a comfortable political position in OTO, withsupporters operating lodges on three continents beside Europe: Jones in Canada,Windram in South Africa, and Bennett in Australia.Looking out on New York on New Year’s Day, 1915, Crowley concluded that Mercurywas lord of the city. The god of commerce was clearly with him, foropportunities waited at his door.The omnibus headed up 5th Avenue. Inside, Crowley read the latest pressclippings on himself that his London cutting service had sent him. A tap on hisshoulder interrupted his leisure. “Excuse me,” a man spoke as Crowley turned toface him. “Do you favor a square deal for Germany and Austria?”Crowley considered the man and his question, and decided to play along. “I wanta square deal for everybody,” he replied noncommittally, much to the other man’sinterest. Their ensuing discussion of politics continued until they reached hisstop. “I have to get off at 37th Street,” the man explained and handed Crowleyhis card. Only after he left did Crowley examine the name on the card: O’Brien.When Crowley’s curiosity led him to call on O’Brien a few days later, theIrishman was nowhere to be found. Instead, he confronted a children’s poet bythe name of Joseph Bernard Rethy19[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts019] at the offices of Germanpropaganda rag The Fatherland. Subtitled “Fair Play for Germany andAustria-Hungary,” its goal was to keep the United States neutral and out of thewar. Rethy responded to Crowley’s visit by fetching a higher authority.He soon returned with poet George Sylvester Viereck (1884–1962), TheFatherland’s publisher. Wide-eyed and smiling, Viereck stepped forward, shookCrowley’s hand, and remarked how nice it was to see him again.Again? he thought.Viereck reminded him: back in 1911, when Austin Harrison introduced them at theoffices of the English Review. He remembered AC as an eccentric mix of poet,pornographer, adventurer, and devil worshiper. As he wrote:I knew nothing against him. I do not object to devil worship and I think that aman’s personal life is his own. Hence, any rumors against him which may havereached me had no effect.20 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts020]Viereck was in a friendly mood, and engaged the poet in conversation.Crowley found Viereck an intelligent and worldly man, particularly in matters ofideology and politics. Viereck’s approach was a relief from Northcliffe’s rabidpropaganda. Turning on his charm, Crowley explained to Viereck that he was anIrishman looking for a job. In response, Viereck ran AC’s “Honesty is the BestPolicy” in the January 13 and 20 issues of The Fatherland; Reuss included aGerman translation in the March Oriflamme. It marked Crowley’s first foray intowhat his detractors would call treason. Shortly thereafter, a political letterthat he circulated among his friends, “An Orgy of Cant,” was printed in TheContinental Times, a European pro-German newspaper;21[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts021] according to Spence, its NewYork bureau was operated by Theodor Reuss out of 40 West 36th Street, which wasalso the address of Crowley’s flat.22[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts022] Crowley’s politically chargedwritings would continue to appear in subsequent issues of both The Fatherlandand The Continental Times over the next two and a quarter years.23[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts023][images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_050_r1.jpg]George Sylvester Viereck (1884–1962), editor of The Fatherland. (photo credit12.1) [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c12-fig001a]Crowley’s motives with these pro-German writings have long been contested. Whilecritics suggest Crowley was an unprincipled opportunist who sold out his countryfor a paycheck, his friends believed the explanation that Crowley gave: he wasworking with the knowledge of the British government to infiltrate Viereck’scircle and publish propaganda so ridiculous as to destroy Germany’s credibility,and to help bring the United States into the war. This was done with the help ofJohn O’Hara Cosgrave (1864–1947), editor of the New York World’s Sunday magazine(which had recently published two articles about Crowley by Harry Kemp and HenryHall). Cosgrave allegedly introduced Crowley to the U.S. Department ofJustice.24 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts024] Indeed, when theUnited States terminated diplomatic ties with Germany just prior to entering thefray, Crowley noted in his diary for February 2, 1917, “My 2¼ years’ workcrowned with success; U.S.A. breaks off relations with Germany.” This issignificant as some have argued that Crowley invented his secret-agent storyyears later in order to return to England without being arrested. Indeed, thisdiary entry shows that counterespionage was his intent all along.Consistency, in fact, is a hallmark of Crowley’s interviews with the Bureau ofInvestigation and the attorney general of New York about his apparent pro-Germanactivities. The account he gave them is corroborated by a memorandum andaffidavit that he prepared at that time, seeking intelligence work from theBritish authorities, and is also consistent with the essay “The Last Straw,”which was included in his Confessions. This militates against the theory thatCrowley changed his story later, and is thus worth summarizing here.Crowley’s September 1914 attack of phlebitis rendered him ineligible for activemilitary service, although he did apply. As Crowley explained, “I asked myfriend, the Hon. Everard Feilding, Lieut. R.N.V.R., of the Press Bureau, to getme a job. Nothing doing.”25 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts025]Several years had passed since Feilding was secretary for the Society forPsychical Research and joined theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg].Since then, he had been appointed a Naval Censor for the Official PressBureau.26 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts026] His reply to AC wasnot encouraging: whereas Feilding had a history of Naval service and a collegedegree, Crowley possessed neither of these. Feilding told him,You wear a short blue gown and an extremely battered mortarboard. You have anextraordinary personality—a reputation for having committed every crime frommurder, barratry and arson to quaternio terminorum.… I cannot hold out any hopesthat any way can be found whereby you might serve your country.27[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts027]Finding himself in America, Crowley got the idea to win the Germans’ confidenceand infiltrate their circle. Reading the press accounts of Crowley’s declarationof Irish independence at the Statue of Liberty (described below), Feilding wroteCrowley a pained letter asking what he was up to. Knowing Feilding to be areasonable man, Crowley explained that he had penetrated Viereck’s propagandaring and was doing his best to discredit the Germans. Although understanding andapproving of Crowley’s strategy, Feilding “could not authorize me to go aheadwithout appealing to his superiors. He put the case before them.… The result wasthat the negotiations came to very little, though I turned in reports from timeto time.”28 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts028]Although he could not obtain official authorization, Crowley proceeded on hisown recognizance in hopes that the authorities would reconsider. “I got the ideaof keeping up that illusion, so as to qualify for a post in the Secret Serviceof England.… I told Lieut. Feilding of the plan, which he thought a good one.”29[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts029] Thus, Crowley continuedwriting for The Fatherland to discredit the Germans and sway American publicopinion. AC summarized his strategy to Joseph W. Norwood (c. 1878–1955), aformer lawyer turned editor of the newspaper Light in Louisville, Kentucky, andfounder in 1919 of the International Magian Society dedicated to the practicalapplication of Masonic principles:30[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts030] “I was employed by the SecretService, my main object being to bring America into the War, my main method toget the Germans to make asses of themselves by increasing their frightfulnessuntil even the Americans kicked.”31[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts031]Then the May 24, 1916, issue of The Fatherland attacked Captain Guy Gaunt forallegedly bribing an office boy at the magazine for information on Viereck.32[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts032] Sir Guy Reginald Archer Gaunt(1869–1953) was England’s Naval Intelligence attaché in Washington. According tohis autobiography, The Yield of the Years (1940), he came to the United Statesin May 1914, where he reported to Ambassador Sir Cecil Spring-Rice; when theembassy learned of German plots in America, “Permission came from London for meto take up Intelligence work, but to work with the greatest caution.”33[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts033] At that, he moved into theBiltmore Hotel in New York and took a couple of small offices at 43–44 WhitehallStreet. In light of the Fatherland’s attacks, Crowley wrote a supportive letterto Gaunt, offering his services. According to Crowley, “He replied very nicelythough in a rather off-hand way, in which he said that he only knew of Viereck‘as one of the lesser jackals around von Papen’ ”34[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts034] and not worth his notice.Shortly thereafter, Crowley had a conversation with investment banker and patronof the arts Otto Herman Kahn (1867–1934), who was a German-born naturalizedBritish citizen who moved to New York in 1893 to work for Speyer and Company.Spence suggests that he was also an intelligence agent.35[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts35] Indeed, after talking with himCrowley applied formally to Gaunt for work, reporting that “I have ever sincekept him informed of my address, so as to be ready if called.”36[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts036] This is corroborated byCrowley’s interviews with American authorities, who wrote “Crowley thendescribed his endeavors to become associated with the British Secret Service,detailing his dealings with Commodore Gaunt of the British Intelligence Officebut admitted that he had never succeeded in obtaining any officialrecognition.”37 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts037]Many officials, both American and British, viewed Crowley’s claims as absurd,and were under the assumption that “the British authorities have conveyed toCrowley an intimation that if he returns to England, his reception will berather more warm than cordial and that it would probably be safer for him toremain on this side for the present.”38[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts038] When questioned about thisallegation, “Crowley denied that there was any action pending against him inLondon that would prevent him from returning to England at any time hewished.”39 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts039] Indeed, whenCrowley returned to England after the war in 1919 and talk of treason was rife,Gaunt contacted British Secretary for Foreign Affairs Sir Edward Grey(1862–1933) and Basil Thompson (1861–1939), chief of Scotland Yard’s CriminalInvestigation Department and head of MI5’s Special Branch,40[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts040] wherein he achieved renown asone of the great spy catchers. Gaunt told these men, “Let him alone. I have gota complete line on him and also The Fatherland.”41[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts041] However, as Crowley commentedon a later attempt to corroborate all this, “I am a little doubtful as towhether Gaunt will reply to your letter. I think the obligation of professionalsecrecy may prevent him.”42 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts042]However, not all officials were so skeptical of Crowley’s explanation. When theassistant to New York’s attorney general questioned Crowley in 1918 about hiswartime activities, he satisfied them that he was truly serving the wareffort.43 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts043] Crowley provided theBureau of Investigation with information about a man whose name is censored fromthe public record. This is almost certainly Viereck, who, as a paid Germanagent, received $140,000 to finance his propaganda prior to the entry of theUnited States into the war. Viereck came to regard Crowley as a spy, writingthat AC “Came to me during the War. Worked for me, wrote about me. Tried to sellme out to the English.”44 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts044]Years later, when planning a trip back to the United States, AC noted in hisdiary,George Sylvester Viereck will sign an affidavit that I had no trouble withauthorities in U.S.A. He said also that after the war he made friends with ourN.I.D. [Naval Intelligence] chiefs, who told him that I had been working forthem during the war.45 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts045]Another of Crowley’s acquaintances in America, Albert Ryerson, recounted:“Crowley really was a secret service man for Great Britain, in the war … Germanspies were continuously after him. He played a slick trick on the Germans byhaving himself, a British spy, on their publication. He practically destroyedthe Fatherland.”46 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts046] While talesof German spies dogging Crowley suggests either Ryerson or AC was exaggerating,this further demonstrates that counterespionage was Crowley’s original intent,not an afterthought.Crowley’s so-called propaganda actually supports this contention. He purportedlystrove to write material so absurd as to discredit the Germans, and in this heseems to have succeeded. His essay “The New Parsifal” immodestly compared KaiserWilhelm to the knight Parsifal, searching for the Holy Graal. Meanwhile, in TheFatherland, Crowley made equally absurd statements:A great deal of damage was done at Croydon, especially at its suburb Addiscombe,where my aunt lives. Unfortunately her house was not hit; otherwise I should nothave to trouble to write this article. Count Zeppelin is respectfully requestedto try again. The exact address is Eton Lodge, Outram Road.47[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts047]Responding to this article, the Chicago Daily Tribune characterized Crowley as“an Irishman who will not be accused of sympathy for England.”48[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts048] This absurd humor permeatesall of his propaganda writings.Crowley also pointed out in his defense that he had never been to Germany exceptpassing through, does not speak German, and had no German friends (“save onewith whom I correspond on religious matters,”49[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts049] i.e. Reuss). Also, he hadpublished poems in The English Review encouraging England’s alliance withAmerica, namely “Chants before Battle” and “To America.”All this has prompted some of Crowley’s biographers to search for evidence of anofficial cover-up of Crowley’s full intelligence involvement for reasons ofnational security. For instance, Booth’s A Magick Life points out that, duringhis 1913 trip to Moscow with the Ragged Ragtime Girls, Crowley had befriendedMoscow Art Theater secretary Michael Lykiardopoulos, who in turn introducedCrowley to British secret agent Sir Robert Hamilton Bruce Lockhart (1887–1970);Lockhart made Lykiardopoulos head of Britain’s propaganda department in Moscow,and Booth suggests he was also in a position to facilitate Crowley’s espionageactivities. However, there is no evidence to suggest Lockhart ever gave Crowleysuch an appointment.50 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts050]Similarly Spence, in Secret Agent 666, dedicates his entire book to exploringthe clandestine political activities of Crowley and his numerous acquaintances,and speculating about possible connections with others in the intelligencecommunity. Although the book claims a larger espionage role than Crowley himselfreports—sometimes based on tenuous connections—Spence treats this topic withmore thoroughness than is possible here; indeed, he has uncovered surprising newinformation and caused many to reevaluate Crowley’s intelligence claims in a newlight. For this, the book deserves a critical read.51[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts051]At the end of the day, the most compelling piece of evidence is that, duringWorld War II, Crowley would work for Britain’s secret service, MI5 and MI6: notraitor would have gotten such a job.Day three.Turbulent times rocked the world that May: German U-boats sank the Lusitania andkilled 1,198. German Zeppelins began their first air raids on London. And Germanphysicist Albert Einstein (1879–1955) published his General Theory ofRelativity. For Crowley, however, all was stagnation. He was far from home, farfrom friends, and far from his business. He had left behind The Equinox and thecircle of students that had filled his life for five years. Now alone inAmerica, he felt adrift. His introduction to Viereck was no help in sellingliterary works, and his efforts at giving lectures or publishing the odd poem orpolitical essay invariably ended in failure. For instance, he enlisted bookmanMitchell Kennerley (1878–1950) to publish The Giant’s Thumb, a collection ofpoetry that he had had typeset by the Ballantyne Press in England but which wasnever released owing to the war; however, the project with Kennerley neveradvanced beyond page proofs. It was a miserable, despondent time.When dawn broke on day four, oppression and obscurity lifted like morning fogburned off by the sun; and the world lolled its head languorously in Crowley’spalm. The article “Aleister Crowley: Mystic and Mountain Climber” appeared inVanity Fair; it was attributed to Arthur Loring Bruce, pen-name of Vanity Faireditor Frank Crowninshield (1872–1947).52[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts052] One Chokmah-day later, thisassociation would provide Crowley with a valuable literary outlet.Then, on the evening of June 10, 1915, Crowley met two beautiful women throughFatherland journalist James Keating. The first was actress Helen Westley53[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts053] (1879–1942), who reminded himof a snake that glitteredwith the loveliness of lust; but she was worn and weary with the disappointmentof insatiable desire. Her intellect was brilliant but cynical. She had lostfaith in the universe.54 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts054]A Brooklyn native, Westley studied at the Sargent Dramatic School, debuted atthe Star Theater in 1897, and acted in vaudeville and stock roles until 1915,when she helped found the first company of the Washington Square Players. Shebegan playing the Oyster in Another Interior, and went on to many otherproductions. Theresa Helburn provides a striking description of her: “She had atheatrical appearance and manner, and dressed rather like a femmefatale—coal-black hair and black, slinky dresses, a little like Charles Addams’young witch.”55 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts055] Although shewould later leave her mark on Hollywood as a “fine character actress who playedeagle-eyed grandmas,”56 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts056]Crowley knew her while she was still in her “Morticia Addams” phase.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_051_r1.jpg]The Snake (actress Helen Westley, 1879–1942).

(photo credit 12.3)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c12-fig003a]The other woman, poet Jeanne Robert Foster (1879–1970), radiated “sweetness longdrawn out.”57 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts057] The ChicagoDaily Tribune had proclaimed that she had “the prettiest chin in the world,”58[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts058] John Butler Yeats called herthe “loveliest woman ever,”59 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts059]and Crowley agreed. An occultist and Theosophist herself, starry spiritualitystudded her speech. She wore her brunette hair gathered on top of her head, andher dark eyes and full lips gave the impression of a cat, domesticated but wildat heart. The following year, she would release two books, Wild Apples andNeighbors of Yesterday.60 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts060]Crowley considered the two women who had become rivals for his affections andmused which he preferred as his “Scarlet Woman”: The Snake, Helen Westley? Orthe feline Jeanne Foster? The Snake was already attached to Keating, but Crowleylearned from Duranty and Chéron that journalists and their women could beaccommodating. Staring across the dinner table at the most beautiful woman hehad ever known, his course was clear. He chose the Cat.As Crowley admired this golden rose of loveliness, his ideal, Jeanne looked backand saw a master of magick, a British poet, and the subject of a Vanity Fairarticle: her own ideal. She told Crowley that she worked for Shaw’s AmericanReview of Reviews; he asked if she might critique his recent writings and helphim improve his prose. She suggested they meet for tea at her club the nextafternoon. Although the Snake eagerly tried to work her wiles on Crowley, he wasfar away in a mutual falling-in-love.By the end of their teatime conversation, Crowley felt he knew Jeanneintimately: she was born in the Adirondacks, the first child of French-Canadianlumberjack Frank Oliver and his English schoolteacher wife, Lizzy. Jeanne’smother encouraged her, “Use your mind; new avenues are opening up for women.” In1896, lumberjack jobs became scarce and her impoverished family moved to GlensFalls. That summer she married Matlock, a family friend who, at age forty-two,was older than her own father. She was seventeen and, within a year, pregnantwith a child that would ultimately be stillborn. In the following years, shedabbled in various careers: taking the stage name Jean Elspeth, she acted withthe American Stock Company; working for the New York Sunday American, she helpeddesign the fashion pages; becoming a model herself, Jeanne’s likeness appearedin newspapers, magazines, and books, including Vanity Fair’s covers and HarrisonFisher’s art. In 1907 she attended Harvard, taking philosophy classes frompsychologist William James. Finishing school in 1910, she quickly gained areputation as a writer and in 1911 moved to New York City to edit the Review ofReviews. Thus, she became entrenched in New York’s literary and artisticcircles, counting John Butler Yeats among her distinguished friends. By thistime, her husband was a sixty-one-year-old invalid, frequenting hospitals andspas in a desperate effort to preserve his health. She learned to live withoutsex since he was incapable and she was infertile.61[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts061]“So,” Crowley attempted a synopsis as he stood in her doorway and bade herfarewell, “you are tied to this old satyr who snatched you from the cradle. Andwhere does that leave me?”Crowley, to her, had a virility and charm that made her head swim. “I loved youat first sight,” she admitted. “As a spiritual brother.” She kissed him, and teaended.That night, Crowley found himself obsessed with Jeanne. He performed a VIII°ritual of thanksgiving for meeting her. Masturbating to the thought of “Babalonimagined as Jeanne,” the image was poor as even now her face faded in hismemory.It was July 3, scarcely a month since the Lusitania had been sunk off the coastof Ireland. The sun had barely risen when a small motorboat with ten passengersleft the recreation pier near West 50th Street and drifted down the HudsonRiver. Crowley manned the prow, accompanied by Leila, editor J. Dorr, andpolitical agitator Patrick Gilley. Their plan was simple: sail to the Statue ofLiberty and proclaim the independence of the Irish Republic. Crowley determinedthe most astrologically auspicious time to be 4:32 a.m.As they approached the docks of Bedloe’s Island, a wrinkle appeared in theirplan. The watchman appeared and informed them that, without governmentpermission, they could neither dock nor set foot upon the island of liberty. Atfirst, Crowley and his compatriots shot lost looks at each other. Unable todock, they floated about the perimeter of the island and awaited 4:32.Then, at the appointed time, Crowley began:I have not asked any great human audience to listen to these words; I had ratheraddress them to the unconquerable dream that surrounds the world, and to thefree four winds of heaven. Facing the sunrise, I lift up my hands and my soulherewith to this giant figure of Liberty, the ethical counterpart of the Light,Life, and Love which are our spiritual heritage. In this symbolism and mostawful act of religion I invoke the one true God of whom the Sun himself is but ashadow that he may strengthen me in heart and hand to uphold that freedom forthe land of my sires, which I am come hither to proclaim.In this dark moment, before the father orb of our system kindles with his kissthe sea, I swear the great oath of the Revolution. I tear with my hands thistoken of slavery, this safe conduct from the enslaver of my people, and Irenounce forever all allegiance to every alien tyrant. I swear to fight to thelast drop of my blood to liberate the men and women of Ireland, and I call uponthe free people of this country, on whose hospitable shores I stand as exile, togive me countenance and assistance in my task of breaking those bonds which theybroke for themselves 138 years ago.Crowley lifted a roll of fabric and declared, “I unfurl the Irish flag. Iproclaim the Irish Republic. Erin go Bragh. God save Ireland.” As he tossed theshreds of his passport into the bay and read the Declaration of Independence ofIreland, a flag with a gold harp on a green field flapped in the wind off theprow mast. They concluded with Leila playing “The Wearing of the Green.” In hisdiary, Crowley noted that he had first been inspired to do this demonstration onJuly 3, when he went to “work at 6 as inspired and vigorous as possible, andnever stopped until at 4:32 a.m. of the next day I had publicly proclaimed theIrish Republic. Never in history (I imagine) has a political movement of thefirst importance been conceived, prepared, and executed at such short notice.”62[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts062]Although Crowley sent an anonymous account of the stunt to the press, describinghimself as an Irishman and a close friend of Irish poet W. B. Yeats, only theNew York Times picked up the story, devoting three long columns to it.63[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts063] Thereafter, he sent the Timesanother letter, signed “Alex C. Crowley,”64[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts064] clarifying that the Irish flagwas not green with a gold harp and that Ireland, like Egypt, was colonized byancient Atlanteans. (The theory was popular among occult “scholars” like GodfreyHiggins, 1773–1833.)65 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts065]This display of political activism has puzzled many biographers. Crowley thechameleon could be fiercely British one moment; then, caught up in the Celticrevival, change his surname to MacGregor; then, at times like these, trace hislineage to the O’Crowleys; at other times, his family tree had roots in France.Those who consider him an opportunist and turncoat see this as Crowleyingratiating himself to the political enemies of England. However, Crowley’ssympathy for Ireland wasn’t taken up suddenly or whimsically. Back in 1913, hewrote a revealing letter with tongue somewhat in cheek:I am going to hear Larking to-night. Of course, as a man I am an Irish rebel ofthe most virulent type, and I want to see every Englishman killed before myeyes. I would ship the English women to Germany, as I don’t like Germans either.But, of course, speaking as a man of the world, I am a reactionary Tory of themost bigoted type, although a Pro-Boer; that is to say, my objection to the Boerwar was the deprecation of property which it caused.66[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts066]The bait cast, Crowley tried to snare a job with The Open Court, a monisticChicago periodical edited by Paul Carus (1852–1919). While the company haddedicated itself to the “Religion of Science and the Science of Religion” sinceits 1887 inception, Carus was eager to promote the German views of his ancestry.AC delineated his own war views in a letter to Carus:It seems to me that Germany stands for everything worth keeping—science,foresight, order, and so on. I am intensely sorry for France; I regard her ashaving been dragged into it by her rotten statesmen. To put it in a word, I hateEngland, I love France, I admire Germany, I fear Russia. My hate for England isnow being replaced by contempt. But I have always taken care to write as anEnglish Isaiah.He submitted several articles and proposals—“Cocaine,” “Perhaps Germany ShouldTake Poland?” “The Darlings of the Gods,” and an article on the occultbrotherhoods—but Carus rejected them all. He did, however, pay $10 for Crowley’s“The New Parsifal”; likewise, he hoped to reprint Crowley’s “gem of satire,” “AnOrgy of Cant.”67 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts067]“The New Parsifal” appeared in the August 1915 issue of The Open Court. Crowley,looking at the world’s rulers, declared Wilhelm II to be the knight Parsifalquesting for the Holy Grail.In the present crisis there are more pigmies than men. Obscure dwarfs likeGeorge V, pot-bellied bourgeois like Poincaré, could only become heroic byvirtue of some Rabelais magic-wand. Joffre and Kitchener are quiet business-likesubordinates with no qualities that can seize the reins of the horses of Apollo.The Czar is a nobody.But there is no necessity to seek so far. The lavish gods have matched theirprophets well with their hero this time. Wilhelm II has always been to a certainextent conscious of himself as an incarnation of Lohengrin, Siegfried,Parsifal.68 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts068]Crowley predicted he would become as legendary and famous a humanitarian asJesus, Mohammed, Arthur, and Napoleon, calling Wilhelm savior of the world outof the twisted corner of his mouth.Shortly after the issue appeared, Carus’s book agent in England, Bryce, wasarrested for carrying The Open Court. The authorities, taking exception to AC’sstatements about Edward VII, declared it propaganda, and the distributor, whohad never so much as read the issue, spent three months in jail. Britain’straitorous black sheep—the greatest metrical genius in the English language, asFrank Harris called him—again shocked the nation. Subsequently, Crowley’s mailat the Open Court offices began arriving opened. Paul Carus, having spoken withhis British literary representative Mr. Jourdain, ultimately wrote Crowley, “assoon as you step on English soil you will be arrested.”69[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts069]While AC’s latest PR spectacle unfolded, Foster wrestled with her heart.Crowley, as a notorious poet and leader of a magical cult, emanated theforbidden. For years she had avoided John Quinn because she had heard youngwomen were not safe around him; but now Crowley attracted her for the samereasons Quinn repulsed her. She was unable to forget him even in her poetry; herlatest, “Wife to a Husband,” expressed her distress over AC’s first marriage.Desperate for advice, she wrote to John Butler Yeats, asking his opinion on herpoem, offhandedly remarking that she wanted to learn magic from Crowley, andrequesting Yeats’s opinion of the man. Yeats detected the personal nature of thepoem and, at least pretending not to connect it to AC, replied:I have met Crowley and enjoyed his conversation very very much, principally, Ithink, because of my profound distrust of the talker. I think he is a man tobeware of. No one seems to think well of him. He has an ambiguous history—queerhappenings, which probably rumour has further distorted. Learn magic by allmeans, but be careful of the magician. They that sup with the devil must have along spoon.70 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts070]Despite Yeats’s discouraging words, Jeanne returned from a business trip on July8, promptly taking Crowley to bed. Although she claimed to dislike the physicalaspects of love, they made love frequently for the next week.She left town again just as suddenly. Hurt and infuriated, Crowley confessedlychose the typically male strategy of striking back: he took her rival, HelenWestley, to bed.Day five.“My God,” Crowley had thought when Frank Crowninshield (1872–1947) first offeredhim work writing for Vanity Fair, “a New Yorker is treating me like a humanbeing.” Since then, Crowninshield read and accepted many of Crowley’ssubmissions. Even when he rejected a manuscript, he explained why and suggestedimprovements. Looking back on his American period, Crowley saw working for theFatherland and Vanity Fair as oases in a desolate search for work. AndCrowninshield he recalled as a charming, intelligent businessman. As VanityFair’s first editor (from 1914 to 1935), he was fearlessly avant-garde, adilettante, and patron of the arts. These qualities forged Vanity Fair into thetop literary magazine of its time. “I can never be sufficiently grateful toFrank Crowninshield for his kindness and patience. My association with him isthe one uniformly pleasant experience of dealing with editors that I canquote.”71 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts071][images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_052_r1.jpg]Irish poet Aleister Crowley, from The Fatherland.

(photo credit 12.5)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c12-fig005a]And why shouldn’t Crowninshield have treated him well? Ever since Crowley lefthim speechless by correctly guessing the birth date of every guest at a party,he knew there was something special about this Englishman. Crowley did notdisappoint him with his contributions. His first publication with Vanity Fairwas a clever interpretation of baseball from the devout Hindu’s point of view:“A Hindu at the Polo Grounds: A Letter from Mahatma Sri Paramananda Guru Swamiji(Great Soul Saint Supreme-Bliss Teacher Learned Person) to His Brother inIndia.”72 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts072] Crowley appeared inthe same issue as the Peking professor Kwaw Li Ya; in the August 1915 issue,Kwaw Li described the haiku and offered $10 for the best contribution fromreaders on the subject of the Manhattan skyline. It began a regular stream ofVanity Fair contributions from Crowley.Around this time, Crowley decided he wanted a son. Thus Jeanne’s early Septemberreturn to New York overjoyed him. Calling her, at her request, by the magicalname “Hilarion,” they conducted several acts of sex magick with the intent ofbegetting a child. On the autumnal equinox, they received the word NEBULAE as anoracle for the next six months. As Jeanne seduced him, Crowley succumbed whileconcentrating on this password.When Jeanne next left New York on October 6, it was with Crowley, heading forthe West Coast on a “honeymoon.” While Jeanne and her invalid husband wentstraight to California, Crowley took various side trips, planning to catch upand sneak off with her as circumstance permitted. Thus, Crowley traveled toDetroit to tour the Parke-Davis pharmaceutical plant, which prepared for him atincture of Anhalonium lewinii. Proceeding to Chicago, Paul Carus gave him atour of the Windy City. By October 12, Crowley arrived in Vancouver, where hehelped establish Agape Lodge as OTO’s foundling North American headquarters. Healso performed a ceremony to advance Jones to theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]grade of Babe of the Abyss, on his way to Magister Templi (8°=3°).According toA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]rules, Crowley’s finding a successor as Magister Templi entitled him to advanceto the grade of Magus. The Magus was a special attainment, as only seven othersin the past had ever attained the grade and founded a religion: Lao Tzu’sTaoism; Thoth’s Egyptian mysteries; Krishna’s Vedanta; Gautama’s Buddhism;Moses’ Judaism; the suffering and slain pattern of Adonis, Attis, Osiris, Jesus,and Dionysus; and the Islamic religion of Mohammed. Crowley joined this elevatedcompany as the eighth Magus in the history of humankind. As a Magus, Crowley’stask was to speak a magical word representing the core of his teaching, thussymbolically destroying the world in fire. Just as Lao Tzu’s word was tao, andBuddha’s word was dukkha, Crowley’s was Thelema.As a Magus, residing in the House of the Juggler, Crowley chose for himself themagical identity that shaped so much of his life: To Mega Therion, the GreatBeast, 666. According to magical and kabbalistic tradition, the number 666 is asacred number attributed to the sun. Traditionally, the sun’s basic number issix. Thus, 36, which is 6 × 6, is an extension of the sun, while 666, the sum ofall the numbers from 1 to 36, provides the number derived from the magicalsquare of the sun. The Great Beast, he believed, was no evil force. Years ofstudy showed him that Revelation was written in gnostic and kabbalistic symbols,and that its text described Christianity’s succession by a new religion whoseprophet was the Great Beast.This creature was a necessary part of magical tradition: Christianity reigned inthe Age of Pisces the fish; this, along with its complementary zodiacal sign,Virgo the virgin, described the exoteric and esoteric aspects of the religion,respectively. Jesus fed the masses with a fish, and the Greek word for fish,[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L04_r1.jpg], is an acronym for the phrase[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L05_r1.jpg] (“Jesus Christ, Son of God,Savior”). Meanwhile, more mystically inclined Christians observed the cult ofthe Virgin Mary. In a similar way, Crowley saw himself ringing in the Age ofAquarius, whose complementary zodiacal sign is Leo, the lion. In the zodiac,Aquarius is a man, just as Revelation states 666 is the number of a man. Thisman, nevertheless, is a Great Beast, just as the esoteric aspect of this man isLeo, the lion, whose astrological ruler is the sun. So strong was thisconnection that Crowley came to believe that Leo, not Aquarius, dominated thepresent cosmic cycle.The prophecy was fulfilled. His mother was right all along. Aleister Crowley wasthe Great Beast 666.Day six.Crowley regretfully left Vancouver and proceeded to San Francisco via Seattle.The last time he had been in California, the earthquake and fire of 1906 haddevastated San Francisco. As he toured the city with dissatisfaction, he mused,“The phoenix has perished and from the cinders arose a turkey buzzard.”73[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts073] He nevertheless welcomed theopportunity to give an impromptu speech on the Law of Thelema. Then, travelingsouth, Crowley looked up Katherine Tingley (1847–1929), former head of the TS inAmerica, in Point Loma; although he proposed an alliance between her society andhis organizations, she refused to see him. Thence he proceeded to the GrandCanyon, which he thought was the best part of the United States. By December, hereturned to New York.Throughout the journey, Jeanne and Crowley met at odd intervals. He was madly inlove with her, and wrote a series of poems, The Golden Rose, about hispassion.74 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts074] One of these,“Dawn,” recounts awakening with her one morning in Santa Cruz:Sleep, with a last long kiss,Smiles tenderly and vanishes.Mine eyelids open to the gold.Hilarion’s hair in ripples rolled.(O gilded morning clouds of Greece!)Like the sun’s self amid the fleece,Her face glows. All the dreams of youth,Lighted by love and thrilled by truth,Flicker upon the calm wide brow,Now playmates of the eyelids, nowDancing coquettes the mouth that moveIn all overtures to love.The Atlantic twinkles in the sun—Awake, awake, Hilarion!Jeanne, however, was torn between her love for this strange wanderer and hercommitment to her husband. Somewhere after Los Angeles, she broke down. Unableto bear the strain of sneaking about and getting away from her husband, Jeanneleft Crowley and returned home.Back in New York, Crowley took up a new residence at 25 West 44th Street in thename of Cyril Grey. (Crowley used this name for himself in the novel Moonchild,which was still being worked on at this time.) He resumed his acquaintance withJohn Quinn, found more of his work in Vanity Fair, and on New Year’s Eve wrotehis first official proclamation of the Law of Thelema as a Magus: “The Messageof the Master Therion.”75 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts075]As far as his feline lover, Jeanne, went, Crowley did his best to get her back.Nevertheless, she refused his advances. Her deceitful mask of innocence outragedhim: she who had left her husband and slept with another man who filled her withecstasy now hid behind propriety when Crowley, the other man, knew it was a lie.He noted that he had been “enlightened as to the falseness of the Cat; ittherefore became my duty to slay her.”76[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts076]On day seven, Matlock Foster began to receive letters that claimed his wife wasliving with a wealthy lawyer and was planning to poison him. Although unsigned,the letters were undoubtedly Crowley’s. Now that his true colors were showing,Jeanne was grateful that she escaped his clutches unharmed. “He’s probably acocaine fiend,” she told herself. “Thank God I never sent him anything with myname on it.” A visit by a shivering and weeping woman, claiming “I have amessage for you,” puzzled Jeanne until she heard its content: Crowley warnedthat if she did not return and help him with the Great Work, she would bedestroyed. Although he most likely meant that the Secret Chiefs would drive herto the same sort of infamy that they had with Rose, Jeanne took it as a threat.Stiffening, she told the messenger, “You and Mr. Crowley can both go to thedevil.”When Crowley finally accepted that Hilarion would not return to him, he decidedto magically sever his ties with her, as he had done with Neuburg before leavingfor America. Thus, he waited outside her Manhattan office until she appeared onthe street at closing time. He confronted her, drawing from his coat his dagger,yellow and inscribed with Hebrew names and sigils. She gasped, thinking he wasabout to kill her. As he conducted the banishing ritual, a crowd gathered towatch. In the confusion, Jeanne vanished into the mob, believing she had escapeda clumsy murder attempt. The incident disturbed her, and she believed thatCrowley astrally visited her one night in her bedroom until she banished him.77[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts077] Their encounter on the street,however, satisfied AC: The ritual was complete, and she was gone from his life.Along with Crowley’s The Golden Rose, only Jeanne’s poems “Wife to a Husband”and “The Answer” remained to commemorate their relationship and its passing.When Leila returned to New York that February 1916, Crowley, impoverished inmoney and affection, sought consolation in her arms, only to realize how farapart they’d grown. They no longer had anything in common, and she could consolehim no more than Elaine Simpson had after his break with “Alice.” Like the Cat,Laylah was history. All that remained of her was a poem commemorating theirseven years:Seven times has Saturn swung his scythe;Seven sheaves stand in the field of Time.And every sheaf’s as bright and blitheAs the sharp shifts of our sublimeFather the Sun. I leap so lithe For love to-day, My love. I mayNot tell the tithe …We know to-day what once we guessed,our love no dream of idle youth;A world-egg, with the stars for nest.Is this arch-testament of truth.Laylah, beloved, to my breast! Our period Is fixed in God—Eternal rest.78 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts078]Waddell would remain in the United States for several more years, taking violinwork as opportunity presented and writing occasional short stories and musicarticles for the Los Angeles press. These latter activities would lead to hercontributing the article “Two Anzacs Meet in London”—recounting her acquaintancewith Katherine Mansfield—to New York’s Shadowland magazine in 1923.79[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts079] She would continue to travelbetween Sydney, America, and England through 1926.80[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts080] Ultimately, news of herfather’s illness would cause her to return to his side in suburban Sydney,81[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts081] where she’d teach at Conventof the Sacred Heart in Elizabeth Bay82[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts082] and make concert appearanceswith the Conservatorium Orchestra under Dr. William Arundel Orchard (1867–1961)and the Royal Philharmonic Society of Sydney under Gerald Peachell,83[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts083] who served as director from1928 to 1931.84 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts084] On September14, 1932, at age fifty-one, Leila Waddell would die of uterine cancer.85[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts085]For Crowley, day seven was a time of emotional desolation.86[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts086]Day eight.Deja vu swept over Crowley that April as once again he considered which of twowomen would be his next scarlet concubine. On the one hand, there was AliceEthel Coomaraswamy, née Richardson (1885–1958), the second wife of art criticand historian Ananda Kentish Coomaraswamy (1877–1947), who was the cousin ofPonnambalam Rámanáthan. She was a Yorkshire musician who, under the stage nameof Ratan Devi (“jewelled goddess”), donned traditional garb and sang Indianmelodies while accompanying herself on the tamboura. Crowley considered her agreat artist, but likened her “insensate passion, volubility, and vanity”87[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts087] to that of a monkey.Alternately, there was Gerda Maria von Kothek, “a girl with a fancy for weirdadventures,”88 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts088] whom Crowleydescribed in some places as a prostitute and elsewhere as “that brilliant young‘Angel of the Revolution.’ ”89 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts089]While coarse and base, she was also pleasant, sensible, and unaffected: apleasant break from Alice. Like his other lovers at this time, hetheriomorphically compared her to an owl. This tendency to compare lovers toanimals was not derogatory. Traditionally, animals, familiars, and spirit guidesassisted great initiations, and Crowley viewed his American period as hisinitiation into the grade of Magus. Thus his lovers became officers of hisinitiation, taking on the attributes of some sacred beast and helping him learnimportant magical lessons.The Owl offered all the delights of carefree ease and placid pleasure; but therewas nothing to be gained. The Monkey represented a life of turmoil and anxiety,with few magnificent moments amid the hours of fretfulness; but progress waspossible. It was as if the Secret Chiefs had asked me, ‘Are you content to enjoythe fruit of your attainment and live at peace with the world, surrounded byaffectation, respect and comfort, or will you devote yourself to mastering andfertilizing mankind, despite the prospect of continual disquietude and almostcertain disappointment?’ I chose the Monkey.90[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts090]While in her twenties, Alice had moved to India, taken up study of its modernand ancient languages, and found an instructor in its music.91[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts091] In the summer of 1911 she wasliving in a houseboat in Srinagar with Ananda Coomaraswamy; her pregnancy andconfrontation with Coomaraswamy’s wife caused the breakup of his first marriageand the beginning of his second. According to Crowley, she was all the whilehaving an affair with Coomaraswamy’s best friend. By 1912, after the birth ofher son, Narada, her performances in England became quite popular; she had whatmight be called perfect pitch, the ability to distinguish—and reproduce—themicrotonal notes that characterize Indian music. W. B. Yeats wrote, “Mrs.Coomaraswamy’s singing delighted me. It was as though a moment of life hadcaught fire, an emotion had come to a sudden casual perfection.”92[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts092] George Bernard Saw alsopraised her work. In 1913 she published the book Thirty Songs from the Pentopand Cashmere.93 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts093] By 1916 theCoomaraswamys had come to New York with their two children (a daughter, Rhino,had been born in 1914) for Ratan Devi’s U.S. concert debut. In advance of herdebut, she was interviewed in the New York Times, where she lamented, “It seemsto be that intensity is the chief thing which distinguishes the poetry of theEast from the poetry of the West. I find very seldom in English poetry thepoignancy that is common in Oriental poetry.”94[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts094] Coomaraswamy called on Crowleyto help with his wife’s publicity; AC responded by providing introductions andwriting about her in Vanity Fair under the guise of “the celebrated Recutsinger, Sri Paramananda Tat.”95[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts095] By mid-April, the Beast becameanother in her supposed string of lovers.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_053_r1.jpg]Alice Ethel Coomaraswamy, née Richardson (1885–1958), a.k.a. Ratan Devi. (photocredit 12.6) [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c12-fig006a]It was also in mid April—the 13th—that Ratan Devi debuted at the PrincessTheater on 39th Street off of 6th Avenue in Manhattan.96[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts096] A reporter for Outlookdescribed the performance:the audience, which filled all the seats, saw on the stage in the foreground twovases of red flowers, and between them, lying on the floor, a long-neckedstringed instrument. The background consisted simply of dark curtains. In amoment the curtains parted and a woman stepped out. She wore Oriental garments,of warm and harmonious colors. Seating herself on the floor, she raised theinstrument and held it vertically before her.Then began a recital of music such as most of the audience had never heardbefore.… The ragas that Ratan Devi sang sounded very strange, of course, toWestern hearers; but, strange as they were, they were most enticing in theirbeauty.97 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts097]She quickly became a sensation in New York.Crowley’s affair with Ratan Devi was a bizarre romp in which he was as much apawn as an instigator. As Crowley tells it, Ananda Coomaraswamy, dubious abouther musical career and appalled by New York’s high cost of living, was relievedthat someone took on the financial burden of caring for her. “All he asked,”Crowley says, “was that I should introduce him to a girl who would be hismistress while costing him nothing.”98[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts098] Crowley obliged, introducingCoomaraswamy to the Owl; soon, the two began living together. “The cost of adouble room being slightly less than that of two singles,” Crowley describedCoomaraswamy’s frugal ways, “he effected a prudent economy by putting this girlin the same bed with his wife when he was out of town.”99[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts099]Just as expenses drove Coomaraswamy to accept this arrangement, Crowleysuggests, Ratan Devi’s success brought him back. By the time he demanded herreturn, however, she was pregnant by Crowley. The encounter turned into ascreaming match between husband and wife while Crowley, to their annoyance,watched with placid indifference, refusing to participate in this distastefulgame. “You are welcome to stay,” he told her, “but the door is also open.”His position clear, Crowley left on business for Washington, D.C. It was perhapsthe Washington Post’s four-column story on Crowley100[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts100] that first brought him to theattention of eccentric and colorful “Stuart X” (Henry Clifford Stuart,1865–1952) whose letters Crowley was hired to edit and introduce for the book AProphet in His Own Country. As Crowley described Stuart:Imagine to yourself a big man, a really big man, six foot three in height, broadand well-proportioned. The entire impression is bigness. And, as should alwaysbe the case with homo sapiens, the most important part of the impression isgiven by the head. Such a brow is only seen in the world’s greatest thinkers.…When he speaks he is transfigured before you. The placid power of the man givesplace to elemental energy.101 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts101]Born in New York in 1865, he was ten years Crowley’s senior. He began workingfor his father at age fourteen, and by twenty-one had become freight trafficmanager for Central America’s most important railroad. From there, he went on tosundry other jobs, including in real estate, as a mining engineer, and as U.S.Consul-General to Guatemala City.102[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts102] He spent fifteen years inSpanish America building railroads,103[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts103] and Crowley identified him asthe land commissioner of the Panama Railroad.104[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts104] A successful businessman, hewas “one of the big boomers in Guatemala industries” and had financialinvestments in New Orleans.105 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts105]He married Grace Ingersoll Patchin in New York on December 11, 1894,106[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts106] and eventually settled inWashington, D.C., where in 1915 he was voted a member of the Washington Board ofTrade.107 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts107]Stuart was an avid letter-writer, sending his quirky, almost free verse,observations about life and politics to hundreds of newspapers and othercorrespondents across the country. One recipient, the White House, responded tothe first few letters, but the vast majority he sent thereafter went unanswered;the Secret Service, investigating, found him “harmless and ‘light.’ ”108[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts108] Another recipient was John R.Rathon, editor of the Providence Journal, who forwarded the letter to the Bureauof Investigation suggesting, “You might give this lunatic the once over.”109[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts109] Crowley collected, edited, andcommented on 191 of these letters, which appeared as A Prophet in His OwnCountry that summer. Ever the entrepreneur, AC even tried selling a copy toTheodore Roosevelt.110 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts110] He alsopitched a new edition—equally unsuccessfully—to Henry Holt & Co.: “Its completeoriginality, both of thought and of style, marks this book as unique. Nothing,since Nietzsche in Germany and Carlyle in England, is at all comparable toit.”111 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts111] The book’s marketing,however, hit a snag when advertisements instructed that orders be sent to theFifth Avenue Bank, Crowley’s bank in New York; the volume of mail became sobothersome that they forced Crowley to close his account with them.112[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts112] To promote the book, Stuartwas also wont to leave copies in various hotels during his travels.113[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts113][images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_054_r1.jpg]Stuart X: Henry Clifford Stuart (1865–1952).

The New Age quipped, “To be introduced and annotated by Mr. AleisterCrowley is a distinction that most prophets have been unable to obtain.… Eitherprophets are rare in America, or they avoid introductions by, perhaps even to,Mr. Crowley.”114 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts114] Meanwhile,the Indianapolis Sunday Star, observed, “With Mr. Crowley’s tremendousintroduction in mind (nobody introduces Crowley) the reader will no doubtapproach the lucubrations of Mr. Stuart with keen expectation.”115[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts115]The August 1916 Vanity Fair featured an article about Stuart. Although unsigned,it is doubtlessly by Crowley, who damns the book and author with faint praise:“His point of view may be rudely described as that of an inspired baby,” hiswriting style “destroys the peace of mind of editors,” and “it will not be hisfault if he does not sell at least one copy.”116[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts116] Two months later, Crowleypublished a letter in the Washington Post insisting that the European press hadmistakenly claimed that he and Stuart X were the same person, and that Crowleyhad only written the “imbecile introduction”;117[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts117] since the Washington Post isnot a European newspaper, the letter appears to be a publicity stunt. Stuarteventually relocated to Northern California, and after his wife died in 1929,118[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts118] he legally changed his name toStuart X,119 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts119] giving himself(arguably) the world’s shortest last name. He died on May 21, 1952, in AlamedaCalifornia.120 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts120] While preparingA Prophet in His Own Country for press that spring, Crowley encountered acurious array of distractions in Washington, D.C. One of these involved amissing jade statue of Kuan-yin, a title of Avalokitesvara, the Bodhissattva ofcompassion in Buddhism. On May 28, 1916, the following ad ran in the ChicagoDaily Tribune and papers in fifty other cities from Washington to St. Louis:JADE KWANNON—STOLEN—$10,000 WILL be paid for information leading to the recoveryintact of the jade kwannon stolen from Dr. S. Y. S. on Aug. 29, 1914. Stuart X.,2619 Woodley-pl., Washington, D.C.121[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts121]“Dr. S. Y. S.” is Sun Yat Sen (1866–1925), the Chinese revolutionary and fatherof modern China, who served in 1912 as the first provisional president of thenewly formed Republic of China. The ad sparked interest in the press, causingStuart to say “This is a very delicate matter. I prefer to think over it untiltomorrow morning, and if you will telephone me then I may be able to saysomething about it.”122 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts122] Uponthe statue’s recovery a few days later, Crowley, on Stuart’s behalf, announcedto the press that its recovery “will, through its powerful influence over theminds of superstitious Chinese, mean a return to power of Dr. Sun Yat Sen.”123[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts123] At this same time, an articleappeared in The Washington Post on “The Oriental Mind”; an elaboration of theprevious statement attributed to Crowley, the article, although unsigned, islikely by AC: “Once more in hand, a wonderful influence is promised over theminds of the superstitious Chinese, with the by no means remote possibility thatthrough its beneficent presence Sun Yat Sen will again be placed in the fulltide of prosperity as regards himself and the future of his beloved nation.”124[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts124]Other less prominent activities also landed Crowley in the D.C. press. He gave alengthy interview for the April 30 Washington Post about good and evil spiritsand nature of possession, after poisoner Dr. Arthur Warren Waite claimed in hisdefense that he was possessed by an evil spirit called the “Man from Egypt” whodrove him to murder his in-laws.125[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts125] In a May 12 letter to theWashington Post, Crowley—recalling his Statue of Liberty stunt—nominated Irelandas arbiters of universal peace.126[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts126] On Friday, May 26, Crowleyplayed four games of chess at the National Press Club againsttwenty-five-year-old chess champion Norman Tweed Whittaker (1890–1975); despiteexcellent playing on both sides, Whittaker won all four games.127[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts127] Later that summer, he posed asa physician to condemn the cruel way in which anesthesia was administered,because psychological stress was the cause of nine out of ten deaths in surgery;Crowley advocated allowing patients to self-medicate, to slowly savor the etherintoxication so that when the surgeon arrives, the patient goes under easily andwillingly:The nurse should be instructed to lead the thoughts of the patient into pleasantchannels; she should describe as vividly as she can the glories and joys ofether.… The surgeon should arrive at from 2 to 3 hours after the beginning. Ifthings have been done properly, the patient should feel just about as muchinterest in his arrival as the theatergoer does when the curtain rises.128[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts128]Crowley advocated this medical practice in a letter to the editor of theWashington Post, signing himself “Aleister Crowley, St. George’s Hospital,London.”While he was away, Alice and Ananda Coomaraswamy resolved their dilemma.Although Alice loved Crowley and wanted to be with him, her husband convincedher to return with him to England for her confinement. Crowley, with a detached“Do what thou wilt,” offered no resistance with her choice. By the end of Mayshe was on a boat for England. Even though she was heading east, for Crowley shewas sailing off into the sunset.On the morning of day nine, Crowley left the consoling arms of the Owl and hisforthcoming work in Vanity Fair and Viereck’s other magazine, the generalinterest The International, for a Great Magical Retirement. Although he hadformally accepted the grade of Magus in October, Crowley felt, in June of 1916,his understanding to be imperfect, his initiation incomplete, and his providenceuncertain. In short, he was stuck in a magical rut.Crowley took a meditative vacation at Adams Cottage, located on Lake Pasquaneynear Bristol, Hebron, and Alexandria, New Hampshire. Known today as NewfoundLake, Pasquaney was seven miles long and two and a half miles wide, thethird-largest lake in the state and perhaps its most beautiful.Lake Pasquaney lies among the mountains of New Hampshire. It is about 17 milesin circumference. Bristol, the nearest railway station, a town of 1200inhabitants, is some three miles from the lower end. The lake contains severalislands, and its shores are dotted with summer villas, mostly of the log huttype, though here and there is a more pretentious structure, or a cluster ofboarding-houses. Bristol is about three hours from Boston, so the Lake is afavorite summer resort, even for week-enders. The scenery is said by Europeanswho know both to compare with Scotland or Switzerland without too seriousdisadvantage.129 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts129]Adams Cottage was wooden with a brick fireplace and chimney. Its main room facedNewfound Lake with the bedroom and kitchen behind the fireplace.Owned by astrologer Evangeline Smith Adams (1868–1932), it was “not herprincipal cottage which she called the Zodiac, but a sort of spare cottage.”130[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts130] He had met Adams in 1915 andagreed to coauthor a book on astrology. The pairing seemed ideal, as a fewmonths earlier he had complained, “I do not think there is any book on Astrologyof any value whatever.”131 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts131]Collaboration was not in the stars, however, and the authors ultimately split,Crowley believing Adams tried to cheat him. In the November 1918 International,Crowley, writing as Cor Scorpionis, published “How Horoscopes Are Faked,” ascathing critique of Adams and her methods.She is grotesquely ignorant of the first principles of astronomy. She has noconception, for example, of the Solar System as a Disk, but imagines that theplanets are all over the place, like the raisins in a plum pudding. She callsher country house the Zodiac—and doesn’t know what the Zodiac is!132[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts132]In the end, Crowley’s manuscript would be published fourteen years later inAdams’s name.133 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts133]In his first days there, he wrote the essay “De Thaumaturgia.”134[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts134] The following day,Independence Day, he mused about his adventures in America and the attainment tothe grade of Magus (9°=2°). This was the first time that he recognized theseventy-three-day cycles that characterized his initiatory journey towardbecoming a Magus. Crowley speculated that thirty-one of these “Chokmah days”would encompass his initiation, since thirty-one was the number of AL, theformal title of The Book of the Law, whose message it was his job as Magus topromulgate. His first three Chokmah days in America—through June 9, 1915—weremiserable, lonely, stagnant times. These ended on the dawn of the fourth day,when, like clockwork, he met Jeanne Robert Foster. On the fifth day, he formallyaccepted the grade of Magus. Crowley and Foster parted by the sixth day, whileRatan Devi appeared and vanished on the eighth. Now, on the ninth Chokmah day,he pondered the meaning of his ordeal.Despite the illumination, Crowley remained uninspired. His diary records hisfrustration with this creative and spiritual block:I am tempted for example to crucify a toad or copulate with a duck or sheep orgoat or set a house on fire or murder some one with the idea—a perfectly goodmagical idea, of course—that some supreme violation of all the laws of my beingwould break my Karma or dissolve the spell which seems to bind me.135[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts135]Horrible as it may strike some, the idea was one of great antiquity. Forinstance, the Hindus who participated in the holy tantric ritual of thepanchatattva—popularly known as the five elements—would drink wine, eat meat,and have casual sex (regardless of caste or relationship); any one of these wasantithetical to the Hindu lifestyle, but in its proper context this ceremonialviolation of convention constituted a powerful magical act.This technique gave Crowley an idea to banish the dying god of the old aeon(Jesus/Osiris/Adonis) and pave the way for the new aeon of Thelema. Early onemorning in mid-July he caught a frog and ensconced it in a chest. Afterpresenting it with gold, frankincense, and myrrh, he released it and baptized itwith the name Jesus. Throughout the day, Crowley sincerely identified both thefrog and himself with the old aeon, worshiping this Jesus and asking it toperform miracles. That night, he again captured the toad, saying to it,All my life thou hast plagued me and affronted me. In thy name—with all otherfree souls in Christendom—I have been tortured in my boyhood; all delights havebeen forbidden unto me; all that I had has been taken from me, and that which isowed to me they pay not—in thy name.He next condemned and crucified the frog, then ended the magical passion play byblessing it, vowing to assimilate its character, and stabbing it in the side. Heritually ate its legs to incorporate the familiar, and the remains he burned tosymbolically consume the old aeon in fire.“The result was immediately apparent,”136[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts136] he noted when a young womanfrom Bristol asked Crowley for a job as his secretary. He considered it and,believing she bore a striking resemblance to the toad, recognized her as thenext animal guide or officer of his initiation. He hadn’t planned on writing,but the gods apparently wished him to; so he hired the Toad and went to work.On July 12, 1916, at about 4 p.m., a sudden cloudburst dumped torrents of rainand lightning on Lake Pasquaney. Dashing out of his cabin and up to shore,Crowley rescued his canoe from the water, then dashed back indoors. When hestepped inside, rain dripping onto the floor from his soaked clothes, heencountered a drenched man and his equally waterlogged wife and child smilingsheepishly back at him. They too sought shelter from the storm. Crowley smiledin welcome, then excused himself to change into dry clothes.A weary sigh escaped his lips as he stepped into his bedroom and out of hisgarments. He was in no mood for uninvited guests. More than withdrawn, Crowleyfelt downright despondent, wondering if he was deluded to think himself a Magus.What if he had strayed in some way, and the Secret Chiefs had abandoned him justas they’d abandoned Mathers? While he could surely continue to write, what wouldbe the point in living? And how could he be sure he was really any good at it?As he pulled on a dry shirt, a his thoughts were interrupted by a “tremendousbang, like the bursting of a bomb, not like thunder.”137[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts137] A fireball a foot in diameterappeared in the cabin, striking the floor inches from his feet and projecting anelectric spark, bright as an arc light, up to his left middle finger. It wasgone as suddenly as it came. After the initial shock wore off, he scanned theroom and found no sign of damage to the building. Like a true Magister Templi,he pondered the significance of this event. The left middle finger wasparticularly sacred, and this coupled with the appearance of the Toad Officerand the unusual presence of those taking shelter in his abode constituted aclear omen to Crowley, assuring him that his ongoing initiation was genuine.He reported the event in a letter to the New York Times,138[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts138] generating some interest inthe scientific community. One of those interested was Doctor William SturgisBigelow (1850–1926), a retired Boston physician who had studied anatomy andpathology in Strasbourg and bacteriology with Louis Pasteur in Paris, thenreturned as a lecturer to Harvard Medical School. A “gay blade who nevermarried,”139 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts139] Sturgis hadconverted to Buddhism, delivered the Ingersoll Lecture on “Buddhism andImmortality” at Harvard in 1908, and in 1911 gave to the Boston Museum of FineArts his collection of 25,000 pieces of Chinese and Japanese art.140[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts140] At his request, Crowleyprovided him a detailed description, with diagrams, of his electricalexperience, e.g., “The colour was violet and ultra-violet, like an arc light,but with much crimson in it,” and “It did not oscillate, but remained steady fora period which I dare hardly estimate, and then burst.”141[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts141] For two of Crowley’sqeustions, however, Bigelow referred him to Professor Thompson.Professor Elihu Thomson (1853–1937)—inventor of the dynamo and founder ofGeneral Electric—confirmed Crowley’s encounter as that anomaly of electricity,ball lightning. He also entertained Crowley’s theories about the phenomenon.142[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts142] Writing privately to Thomson,Bigelow remarked “His letter seems clear, all but the first and last lines,which, with the odd red stamp on the first page, suggest that he may possibly besome kind of a crank.”143 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts143]Also convincing AC of the validity of his initiation was a state ofconsciousness he dubbed the Star-Sponge Vision. It began gradually rather thanfull-blown, with Crowley losing his sense of all substance in the universe.Aware only of infinite space—the kabbalistic Ain Soph—this void soon filled withcountless pinpoints of light. He understood this to represent the basicstructure of the universe. Concentrating on the vision, the black void recededinto the background while all of space bathed in light, the kabbalistic Ain SophAur (limitless light). Despite the field of light against which they shone, allthe pinpoints of light remained visibly distinct. Nothingness with twinkles, hethought. But what twinkles! In time, Crowley associated these points with stars,souls, and thoughts. And he saw all the points interconnected through a networkof luminescent rays, just as the universe’s contents were all related. He wouldnever again see the world in the same way.On day ten, Ratan Devi began sending letters to Crowley, begging him to take herback: on the boat to England, she had gotten sick and miscarried. She hadreconsidered and wanted to be with him. Crowley minced no words in his reply.She had made her decision, and the only way he would take her back was if shemade a clean break with her past and left her husband. Despite daily letters tohim, she was unable to take what Crowley considered to be the necessary steps.Unfortunately, in 1917, after Crowley was well out of the picture, her husbandleft her for Stella Bloch, a seventeen-year-old dancer from one of herrehearsals, thus ending their troubled marriage.Meanwhile, Crowley was oblivious to the wheels turning in Vancouver. While ACwas at Adams Cottage, Frater Achad passed through the Abyss and took the oath ofa Magister Templi, filling the grade so his Master could proceed to that ofMagus. Unfortunately, Jones soon concluded that he had leapfrogged over Crowleyto the ultimate grade of Ipsissimus (1°=10°) at the top of the Tree of Life;but, unable to manage so great an attainment, he plunged down the tree’s centralshaft back to its base as a Neophyte (10°=1°). To match the reversal of hisgrade from 1°=10° to 10°=1°, Jones expanded his new motto from OIV (Omnia inUnum, “All in one”) to OIVVIO (Omnia in Unum, Unus in Omnia).Hearing the news on August 21, 1916, Crowley was, as might be expected,surprised. The logical holes in Achad’s claim notwithstanding, Crowleyconsidered his star pupil’s attainment to the grade of Magister Templi (the onlyclaim he accepted) to be a remarkable fulfillment of prophecy. Exactly ninemonths after his rituals to have a child by Jeanne Foster culminated on theSeptember 1915 equinox, Crowley had not a physical child but a metaphysical one:Frater Achad emerged from the Abyss and assumed the mantle of a Magister Templi.He was furthermore the child prophesied in The Book of the Law:The child of thy bowels, he shall behold them.Expect him not from the East, nor from the West; for from no expected housecometh that child.144 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts144]Crowley always expected a biological child, and OIVVIO came from no expectedplace. AC was overjoyed to have not only a son, but his first successor sincethe days of Jones, Fuller, and Neuburg.With the Toad Officer goading him to write, Crowley took inspiration from hisleisure reading at the cottage. These included Shaw’s Androcles and the Lion(1913) with its long preface on Christianity; anthropologist Sir James G.Frazer’s (1854–1941) classic and elephantine tome on ancient myth and magic, TheGolden Bough (1890, 1900, 1911–1915); and psychoanalyst Carl G. Jung’s(1875–1961) Psychology of the Unconscious: A Study of the Transformations andSymbolisms of the Libido (1916), whose chief argument, Crowley thought, was thatsex is an outgrowth of the Will, not the converse, as Freud argued.Shaw was his first catalyst. Plymouth upbringing left Crowley well versed withthe Bible, and reading Shaw’s disquisition on Jesus, he concluded the playwrightknew neither the Bible, the East, nor mysticism. So he critiqued it in TheGospel According to St. Bernard Shaw, which weighed in at roughly 55,000 words.He claimed that it “establishes the outline of an entirely final theory on theconstruction of Christianity.”145[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts145] Introducing his edition of thebook, Francis King called ita treasury of Crowley’s wit, wisdom and criticism which, even if it was the onlybook its author had written, would suffice to rebut the slander that Crowley wasa pleasure-seeking fraud whose occultism was no more than “making a religion outof his weakness.”146 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts146]After finishing this work, Crowley penned a set of eight short stories based onThe Golden Bough. The first, written on August 30, was “The Priest of Nemi”(eventually retitled “The King of the Wood”), which took its title directly fromFrazer. In the two weeks that followed, he finished “The Mass of Saint-Sécaire,”“The Burning of Melcarth,” “The Oracle of the Corycian Cave,” “The Stone ofCybele,” “The God of Ibreez,” “The Old Man of the Peepul-Tree,” and “TheHearth.”147 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts147]Finally, Jung’s book inspired Crowley’s synopsis, “An Improvement onPsycho-analysis: The Psychology of the Unconscious—for Dinner-TableConsumption,” which would appear in Vanity Fair. 148[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts148]Meanwhile, his Thelemic pamphlet “The Law of Liberty” was out in England, withanother 250 copies for Australian distribution by Frank Bennett.Despite this prodigious output, Crowley nevertheless found time for his sexmagick research, commencing on the fall equinox with Gerda von Kothek, the Owl.This working resulted in Gerda having a vision wherein “Monks in brown robes andhoods go up a green hill, with misty top, in an endless line. They wear ringswith red cross within a gold triangle.”149[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts149] These visions continued forfour days, and inspired Crowley to paint “Four Red Monks Carrying a Black Goatacross the Snows to Nowhere.” It marked an early stage of his foray into art.On day eleven, Crowley wrapped up business at Lake Pasquaney and departed forNew Orleans. He arrived on December 9, 1916, still despairing over the state ofhis life and determined to continue his Great Magical Retirement. Promptly onarrival, his depression lifted in his experience of the Beatific Vision. Harmonyand calm overwhelmed him, healing his spiritual woes. Finally convinced the godswere with him, Crowley decided to test them. After a decade of struggle andpoverty, he tired of it. The Logos, the prophet of the New Aeon, was going onstrike until he received better pay and benefits:I therefore down tools until I have (1) a competent stenographer (2) moneyenough in hand to see me comfortable through until the Equinox of Spring.… (3) aguarantee—by some signal, sign or in some more practical manner—that all will bewell in the future.… (4) means of publishing immediately all MSS except thosedestined for Equinox Volume III.150[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts150]He would do nothing. And if he starved, then the gods could damn well pull hisfat out of the fire.The strike continued for two weeks before Crowley realized matters had notimproved. Finally succumbing to pressure, he noted in his diary:27 December. I am now going to start work again, with absolutely no resources. Ihave not even proper paper or money to buy it. Total cash in hand, 70 cents.Day twelve.Simon Iff was a mathematician, chess master, Freemason, and mystic. He solvedcrimes using the principles of psychology and the Law of Thelema. As Crowleydescribed him,He had a habit of disappearing for long periods, and it was rumoured that he hadthe secret of the Elixir of Life. For although he was known to be over eightyyears of age, his brightness and activity would have done credit to a man offorty; and the vitality of his whole being, the fire of his eyes, the quickconciseness of his mind, bore witness to an interior energy almost more thanhuman.He was a small man, dressed carelessly in a blue serge suit with a narrow darkred tie. His iron-grey hair was curly and irrepressible; his complexion,although wrinkled, was clear and healthy; his small mouth was a moving wreath ofsmiles; and his whole being radiated an intense and contagious happiness.151[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts151]Crowley’s newest literary creation, Simon Iff was his idealized self-portrait.The gods willing, Iff would also pull him out of the economic pit into which hehad fallen. This foray into the popular genre of crime fiction neverthelesspermitted him to advertise Thelema. The key was to make the stories accessible—atask at which Crowley had failed with his books of poetry and magick.Remarkably, he successfully produced well-written and entertaining popularfiction; in short order, he wrote six Simon Iff short stories: “Big Game,” “TheArtistic Temperament,” “Outside the Bank’s Routine,” “The Conduct of JohnBriggs,” “Not Good Enough,” and “Ineligible.” These, like his Frazer-inspiredpieces, appeared in The International.152[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts152] Crowley went on to writeanother eighteen Simon Iff short stories based on his experiences in America,but these were never published in his lifetime.He based the story “Not Good Enough” on his relationship with Ratan Devi, who,even as he wrote it, was still begging Crowley to visit her for Christmas andtake her back. By this time, Crowley blamed Ananda Coomaraswamy for sendingRatan Devi on the boat trip that killed their child; in his diary, AC wouldremember him as a “bastard, thief, coward and murderer.”153[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts153] Thus, he modeled his story’svillain, Haranzada (Hindi for “bastard”), after Coomaraswamy, who was reportedlyshocked to read it.Finishing the short stories, Crowley wrote his novel The Butterfly Net. 154[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts154] Although Simon Iff figuredinto this one as well, the main character of the story was Lisa Guiffria (basedon Mary Desti), who became involved in the creation of a homunculus. Thisdifficult and convoluted story remains of interest largely because it lampoonshis notable acquaintances, including A. E. Waite, Gwen Otter, Annie Besant,Everard Feilding, W. B. Yeats and Isadora Duncan. While staying at AdamsCottage, Crowley had entertained himself by dealing and playing through severalhands of card games like skat, piquet, and bridge. In the process, he developeda variation on auction bridge that was such an improvement that he convincedFrank Crowninshield to share it with the readers of Vanity Fair. Crowley’sinnovation was this: rather than partners being preselected, players paired upafter the cards are dealt using a bidding process. Thus players with a strongcombined hand could team up. Crowninshield dubbed the game “pirate bridge” andconvened private play-testing sessions to flesh out the rules and strategies.155[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts155]Crowley was delighted when they enlisted the help of New York surveyor and notedcard-game authority Richard Frederick Foster (1853–1945), “a man who, twentyyears before, had been the inaccessible godhead of the universe of card games tomy undergraduate enthusiasm!”156[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts156] He began writing in 1890 witha manual on whist and over his career penned some sixty-eight books on cardgames, including the encyclopedic tour de force Foster’s Hoyle.157[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts157] Initial play-testing tookplace on November 3, 1916, at New York’s Knickerbocker Whist Club, with Crowleyand Crowninshield observing. Over the following weeks, it was tried in varioussettings and, according to Foster, “everywhere met with an enthusiasticreception.”158 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts158] Foster believedthat pirate bridge would supplant auction bridge to become America’s favoritecard game, and at the end of December 1916 issued a press release that waspicked up by papers from Boston to Chicago to Kansas City.159[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts159] He prepared a thirty-six-pagebooklet on The Official Laws of Pirate Bridge, which sold for twenty-five cents,to promote the game.160 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts160] Healso wrote a series of seven articles on the game that ran in Vanity Fair fromJanuary through July 1917,161 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts161]another fifteen weekly articles for the Philadelphia Inquirer that ran fromJanuary through April,162 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts162] andvery quickly prepared Foster’s Pirate Bridge, which appeared in February1917.163 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts163]Not everyone shared Foster’s high hopes for pirate bridge. American bridgeauthority Milton Cooper Work (1864–1934) complained, “Its play compared withauction in two-thirds of the hands is a joke. Whenever the partners sit next toeach other all finessing and much of the beauty of the play is lost.”164[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts164] Nevertheless, the game becametrendy in the last years of the 1910s. According to the Lincoln Sunday Star,“people in the east are quite mad about the new game of bridge and … piratebridge parties are the dernier cries.”165[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts165] Indeed, excitement spread, andpirate bridge games, clubs, and demonstrations soon popped up across the UnitedStates.166 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts166] Pirate bridgeproducts appeared to meet the demand, and soon the trend even hit London andParis: Foster’s Pirate Bridge was released in London, and the free “War Issue”of Brain Power, distributed to 100,000 readers, included an article on thegame.167 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts167] French-language bookson the game also appeared at this time.168[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts168]Although he says that Foster misunderstood one of the rules—thus spoiling thegame—Crowley nevertheless enjoyed his newfound celebrity. He was featured as thecreator of pirate bridge in an illustrated article for The Washington Post, withhis “Appeal to the American Republic” excerpted as an example of his poeticwork.169 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts169] As Crowley recalledthis period, “I had only to wander into the appropriate circles to make myselfthe darling of the community.”170[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts170]As with all pop culture trends, this one soon faded. Contract bridge came alongin the 1920s and became the next big thing in the bridge world; it has sincebecome virtually synonymous with the term bridge.On January 22, 1917, Reuss released a revised OTO constitution and a manifestofor an Anational Grand Lodge, whose headquarters was at Monte Verità, a utopiancommune located near Ascona, Switzerland. He planned an Anational Congress onAugust 15–25, its announcement proclaiming, “There are two centres of the OTO,both in neutral countries, where enquiries can be lodged by those interested inthe aim of this congress. One is at New York (U.S. of America), the other atAscona (Italian Switzerland).” During the congress, readings were conducted ofCrowley’s poetry and of the Gnostic Mass. On August 18 and 19 there was also atwelve-hour open-air performance of a Sonnenfest—a Sun Festival or “choralplay”—by modern dance pioneers and IX° members Rudolf Laban (1879–1958) and MaryWigman (1886–1973), along with their female troupe. According to Wigmanbiographer Mary Anne Santos Newhall, “Under Reuss’s influence, Laban founded hisown women’s lodge and inducted his dancers, creating some local outrage andescalating speculation about the ‘sexual magic’ practiced by the Order.”171[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts171]Back home, MMM experienced its share of growing pains: financially, things weretight. With creditors presenting bills and threatening legal action, the MMMlodge at 33 Avenue Studios was shut down and moved to 93 Regent Street, and muchof its contents warehoused. Some items were even pawned to pay bills.Destitute, Crowley left New Orleans to stay with his cousin, Lawrence Bishop(1872–1961), and his wife, Birdie. A father of three, Bishop was born inKentucky and had been a merchant and farmer, but in the 1910s he became a citrusgrower in Titusville, Florida.172[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts172] When Bishop came to Streathamaround 1894, Crowley’s family had put him up; they reciprocated when EmilyCrowley visited them in Kentucky in 1904.173[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts173] AC now counted on similarhospitality. It was hardly an imposition, as Bishop had plenty of money in thebank, and his orange and grapefruit plantation was so large that his nearestneighbor was ten miles away. On February 9, 1917, Crowley arrived.Although the Bishops did their best to accommodate Crowley, the fundamentalistbeliefs of his cousin, now fiftyish, sickened AC so that he recalled him as“spiritually stunted and corrupted in every way by savage superstition”; forinstance, he believed God sank the Titanic as punishment for its builders’pride. His wife, Alma, was no better. Although under thirty, she appeared a“wrinkled hag of sixty, with no idea of life beyond the gnawing fear of thehereafter.”174 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts174] A tyrannicalmother, her children constantly cried, “I don’t want to grow up to be likeMother!” Although she and Crowley did not get along, she inspired the Simon Iffstory “Suffer the Children,” which Crowley considered one of his best.Despite these public sentiments from his Confessions some thirteen years afterthe fact, at the time Crowley offered a grateful gesture, certainly anonymously.On March 6, 1917, his diary records:Threatened severe frost. I averted same, to repay my cousin for his hospitality.The Op[us] was very remarkable. I went out at noon, in bitter cold and highwind; and I willed. I then slept very deeply for three hours, and woke in still,warm weather, with the sun shining. The forecasts had given several days ofcold; and forecasts in America are very different to those in England; therarely go wrong.Crowley’s misguided confidence in American meteorology notwithstanding, hebelieved he saved his cousin’s orchards.Still miserable, Crowley concluded that the Secret Chiefs were punishing him forbeing so cocksure as to go on strike. When he left Titusville that spring,Crowley sang softly to himself,What though the spicy breezesBlow soft o’er Titusville,Though every prospect pleases,The people make me ill.175 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts175]Day thirteen.Although Crowley left the South far behind when he returned to New York, povertyfollowed him. “I really don’t quite remember what I did about eating,” herecalled.176 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts176] His friend andpupil, Leon Engers Kennedy (1891–1970),177[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts177] let Crowley sleep on the sofain his Manhattan studio for “quite a long time.”178[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts178] He first entered Crowley’scircle when he joined theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]on September 23, 1912; and when John Yarker died in 1913, it was he, as newlyappointed Patriarch Grand Secretary General of the Sovereign Sanctuary of theAncient and Primitive Rite of Masonry in and for Great Britain and Ireland, whoannounced Henry Meyer’s election to the membership.179[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts179] In the last Equinox, Crowleydedicated the poem “The Disciples” to him.180[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts180]Leon Engers (he later dropped his last name altogether) was born in Antwerp,Belgium, on February 22, 1891, but he described himself as a Dutch citizen.181[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts181] This may be explained byCrowley’s comments that Engers was “the adopted son of a multi-millionaire” and“was in receipt of an ample allowance from his family.”182[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts182] Studying art at the Sorbonneand Académie Julian in Paris, Engers’s drive to paint something deeper than thephysical appearance of his subjects eventually led him to occultism. The resultwas the “psychochrome,” or painting of his sitter’s aura.183[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts183]In exchange for the hospitality, Crowley encouraged Engers’s artistic endeavorsby arranging a November, 1917, exhibition of his art and reviewing it in TheInternational, where he enthused: “These pictures must be seen to be appreciatedat their full value. But it is certainly possible to predict a great vogue forthese portraits. Everyone must naturally wish a representation in permanent formof their inner as well as their outer body.”184[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts184] In an unpublished essay,Crowley similarly praised his paintings,Psychochromes represent a duplex advance: one column attacking aesthetic, theother vision. Mr. Engers Kennedy has happily combined the forms of penetrationinto soul, and character with the art, of decoratrice and in his psychochromeshe expresses in some cases the individuality of the sitter, in others atemporary mind in such a way that truth varies with beauty.185[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts185][images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_055_r1.jpg]Soul-painter Leon Engers Kennedy (1891–1970).

(photo credit 12.9)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c12-fig009a]In January 1919 the Atlanta Constitution ran a full-page story on Engers and his“soul-paintings”; a month later he exhibited his psychochromes at the Paint BoxGalleries in Washington Square South.186[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts186] Engers would go on to studyart under Lyonel Feininger (1871–1956) at the Bauhaus.187[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts187] When he married CatherineElizabeth Reilly of New York,188[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts188] Crowley lamented:I failed, however, to keep him out of the clutches of a very beautiful redheadedIrish typist, hysterical from sexual suppression. She finally persuaded him tomarry her, and I am afraid his last chance of a career is among the dustydocuments in the files of the marriage bureau at City Hall. At least, I haveheard no more of him since his return to Holland.189[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts189]Despite this direful judgement, Engers went on not only to teach painting anddrawing at Bradley University’s School of Art from 1949 to 1958 but also toserve as its director.190 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts190] Evenlate in life, he held several exhibitions, including at Bradley’s Gallery 20 in1964 and New York’s Fulton Gallery in 1965.191[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts191] These exhibits included, amonghis portraits and studies in light, paintings from his Transcendental Series. Ashe then explained them, “Here I attempt to depict, to give form to a subjective,spiritual experience, one relating to the destiny of man in his cosmicevolution.” His definition of an artist, although not original, neverthelessresonates with Thelemic philosophy: “The true artist must paint. He finds hispainting an inescapable necessity—he has an inner drive that demands that hisideas, philosophies, feelings, and his soul be put on canvas. This is thedistinction between a master and a talented amateur.”192[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts192]When Crowley met slice-of-life author Theodore Dreiser (1871–1945), his classicAn American Tragedy was still a decade off. In 1917 he nevertheless had areputation with his books Sister Carrie (1900), The Financier (1912), and TheTitan (1914). Viereck had offered to publish his newly completed The “Genius” inThe International, but Dreiser, loyal American that he was, refused; shortlyafter publication this same novel would be banned by the New York Society forthe Suppression of Vice. For his part, Crowley sold Dreiser copies of The Worksof Aleister Crowley and The World’s Tragedy and borrowed $15.Dreiser, whom Crowley considered to be one of the few people in New York worthspeaking to, reluctantly attended one of AC’s Anhalonium parties at theinsistence of their mutual friend, Louis Wilkinson. When they arrived, Crowleysized up the author and declared, “It will take treble the usual dose to moveDreiser.” He disliked Crowley’s antics and resented the dare implicit in thestatement. When Crowley presented him with a hallucinogenic drink, Dreisersnatched it from his hand and boldly knocked it back.Unfamiliar with the drug, however, Dreiser soon questioned the wisdom of hisaction. What if the drug made him sick? What if he had a bad reaction? What ifit was poisonous? “Uh, Crowley,” he approached his host sheepishly, “is there agood doctor in the neighborhood … in case anything goes wrong?”Crowley responded reassuringly, “I don’t know about a doctor … but there’s afirst-class undertaker on the corner of 33rd and Sixth Avenue.”Dreiser sat in stunned silence. After a time, he finally said, “I don’t likethat kind of joke, Crowley.” However, after the colorful visions began, hedescribed in detail his hallucinations while a small English actor lay besidehim, moaning and vomiting into the bedside basin. It was a toss-up which wasworse, Dreiser’s narration or the actor’s retching.On May 4, 1917, Crowley—oblivious to the trouble that was about to explode atRegent Street—dreamed that his mother had died. The quality of this dreamdiffered markedly from his usual dreams, causing him to ponder its significance.The answer arrived two days later: he learned that Emily Crowley was indeed deadat age seventy.193 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts193] Ironically,Crowley was on the wrong side of the Atlantic to collect his £3,000 inheritance(equivalent to roughly $125,000 today).By the end the month, Crowley’s health returned. He sought out a prostitute toperform his first act of sex magick in a month—only his fifth this year—with thegoal of completely restoring his health. He proceeded with operations toenergize his will and spread the Law of Thelema. It signaled the end ofCrowley’s dry spell and the beginning of renewed prosperity.At its new location at 93 Regent Street, MMM thrived under the direction ofmedium Mary Davies, V°. Mary Davies (née Brick) was born in 1867 on PortseaIsland, Hampshire, to Elizabeth and Edward Brick, the latter a Civil Guardsergeant at the Portsea Convict Prison.194[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts194] She was the oldest of fivechildren.195 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts195] According toDavies,My name, Mary, was given to me in Baptism in the hope that I should be blessedby the Virgin Mother, so I was brought up and confirmed in the Faith soon afterthe age of seven, made my first Confession and Communion, and was enrolled inthe order of the Scapular of our “Lady of Mount Carmel” at the age of twelve.196[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts196]While a girl of seven, she awoke to a spiritual visitation from her patron,Saint Theresa. From that point, her childhood was filled with clairvoyant andother psychic experiences; this gradually led to her leaving Catholicism anddevoting herself to study, public speaking, and holding classes. In February1886 she married William Robert Davies, a friend of the family and a pettyofficer in the Royal Navy.197 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts197]She had two children, William Clemance (b. 1888), who died in 1893 from achildhood illness, and Theophilus Stewart (b. 1892).198[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts198] Relocating to London,199[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts199] the Davieses encountered aSpiritualists’ Society, of which Mary would become president; they also formed acircle of fourteen to sixteen people, holding meetings at their home twice aweek and launching her career as a medium; her career up to 1912 is detailed inher memoir, My Psychic Recollections (1912). Although reviewed in TheTheosophist and Atheneaum, it is Crowley’s 1912 review in The Equinox that is ofmost interest:Mrs. Davies is a “professional medium”; of such I have said things which only myincapacity for invective prevented from being severe. But though (no doubt) thephenomena recorded in this book are ‘non-evidential,’ I do feel the sincerity ofthe writer. I am confident of her good faith.200[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts200]Indeed, Davies had been aware of Crowley and his circle as early as 1910, whenshe met George Raffalovich at one of the rites (whether one of the lesserrituals like the Rite of the Phoenix or the grand Rites of Eleusis is unclear).Both Crowley and Cowie privately disparaged her interests in clairvoyance andspiritualism but quietly tolerated them in light of her other strengths. By thesummer of 1913, she took her III° initiation, and by 1916 the Lodge, with herhelp, moved into its space on Regent Street.MMM members were unanimous in her praise. Organist William Steff Langstondescribed her as “one of the most lovable of her charming sex, she hassweetness, tact, power and ability in profusion … she is just the one to attractthe people we need.”201 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts201] Cowieconcurred. “She’s a good soul and a good sort altogether, and her gift, whichappears to amount to ability to knock about on the plane next to material, isquite genuine.”202 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts202] That April,Davies reported, “we had 3 Initiations and an affiliation of a Master fromRugby—we now have only 2 First Degree all the others are raised, as a L[odge] wenumber 21 (9 M[inerval] & 11 F[irst]) with 3 waiting Initiation.”203[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts203] As G. M. Cowie recounted: “Weowe much to Mary Davies. Practically every new member has been brought in byher. Besides, the membership is steadily growing.”204[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts204]Alas, during this fecund period MMM came under police scrutiny. Cowie wasshadowed by an investigator, his reputation the subject of official inquiry.Late in the winter of 1917 he was finally questioned about what MMM was, and thenature of his involvement. It soon became clear that this inquiry was connectedto AC’s political writings. As Cowie wrote to Crowley:I learn that it is only my known probity of character, which unknown to me, hasbeen closely inquired into, that has satisfied the authorities that the Lodge isexactly what is set forth in the Manifesto and that we have no politicalmotive.… The authorities say that so long as I am in control in England and solong as we are not helping you, they are satisfied and we may continue.Otherwise, I have no doubt we should have been closed down … I must make itclear that everyone who has joined us did so in complete ignorance of your‘views’—and is guiltless of any political motive.205[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts205]The authorities’ assurances, however, proved fleeting.A couple of months later—on Monday, May 14, 1917—Detective-Inspector John Curryof New Scotland Yard went with another officer to 93 Regent Street. The glasspanel of the door bore the letters “MMM,” which he knew stood for MysteriaMystica Maxima. Inside, they found additional signage that read MARY DAVIES,SITTINGS 11 TO 5 and CLAIRVOYANCE. Entering a front room on the third floor,they found five men and five women dressed in Master Masons’ uniforms, andDavies herself dressed as a Worshipful Master, or head of the Lodge. The policepresented a warrant for Davies’s arrest. Protesting that she had done nothingwrong, she was told, “I understand you call this the ‘Order of the Temple of theOrient,’ and your founder is Aleister Crowley, a man of evil reputation and atraitor to this country.” The arrest warrant, however, simply charged her underthe Vagrancy Act for telling fortunes. She was taken into custody, and thepolice seized furniture, regalia, books, and papers for examination (never toreturn them). The arrest garnered headlines, like the Times’s “ ‘M.M.M.’Mysteries: Order of the Temple of the Orient Raided.”206[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts206]Witnesses for the prosecution recounted visits to her under false pretenses.Bertha Brondle consulted Davies about a fictitious sick child and receivedinstructions on how to affect a spiritual cure. Similarly, Blanche Daisleyconsulted her about a similarly fictitious brother in the Flying Corps, to betold that he had died but that he was now being guarded by two spirits. For thisadvice, the women paid 10 shillings 6 pence. Davies protested that she did notprofess to tell fortunes; she described herself as an author and preacher.Nevertheless, she was found guilty and fined £40, plus 10 guineas costs.207[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts207]Crowley initially believed the raid was arranged by Feilding as a publicitystunt to maintain his cover, but soon realized it was an official response tohis wartime activities. This hampered fund-raising efforts to pay his passageback to England. As Cowie informed Crowley, “We could not even think of raisingfunds to bring you back, desirable as it is, when we are told you will certainlybe arrested if you return.”208 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts208]As a solution, AC resigned as head of MMM and appointed Frater Achad as nominalGrand Master. In subsequent letters, Cowie wrote to Crowley, “It’s just ‘carefrater’ [dear brother] now, as in happier days of old”209[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts209] and “As you are no longerG[rand] M[aster] but my guru as of old.”210[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts210] Nevertheless, efforts tocontinue operating were difficult. Other than membership dues, MMM’s onlyrevenue came from sales of Crowley’s books … and even this had to bediscontinued. “I’ve not been able to supply one of the rare orders for bookslately,” Cowie explained to Crowley at the end of 1917. “The real and vitalreason however, and here you force my hand, is that the police were trying totrace your property in this country.”211[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts211]In response to the bad publicity resulting from both her arrest and herconnection to the “evil” and “traitorous” Crowley, Davies ran the followingletter in The Occult Review:On May 15 last, the Press generally stated in connexion with the prosecutionagainst me, Mary Davies, of 93 Regent Street, that I was the protégée of a manof evil reputation and a traitor to this country. I desire emphatically todisavow any such association. I have no knowledge whatsoever, nor ever had, ofthe views and actions—political, social or private—of the person referred to.The only link I had with this person was on Masonic grounds, in the mysterieswhich no one could be more profound. It is scarcely necessary to stress my ownpatriotism, as my public know since the beginning of the war my IntercessoryServices at Kensington have been solely such as to encourage and to fortifyevery patriotic effort, and I deliberately repudiate the stigma implied by thequotation given above.212 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts212]Davies appealed the ruling but, on October 26, 1917, the decision was upheld.213[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts213] The legal bill for her defensetopped £250, and Cowie—indignant that this sweet and sincere fifty-year-oldwoman had suffered publicly and financially because of Crowley’spolitics—adopted an increasingly bitter tone in his correspondence: “In one wayand another, the Lodge has cost me more than the total contributions of themembers; and all lost uselessly thanks to your politics.”214[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts214] Bitterness quickly becameresentment:I told you long ago that the continental origin of the O.T.O. would make itimpossible to work it in England and that is now evident.

On April 30, 1918,a classified ad ran in the Times reading “Regenta Tea Rooms, 93 Regent-street,newly decorated. Apartments furnished; also one floor as office; partattendance.

This final act was a relief toCowie, who sank much of his own money, including his retirement fund, intokeeping the mortgage afloat.218[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts218] Cowie’s last tie to Crowleyhad been cut.On August 6, Crowley opened an account in the name Ordo Templi Orientis with theTitle Guarantee and Trust Company, wherein the proceeds from the sale weredeposited from England through the law firm of Lord, Day and Lord. Although thiswas technically OTO’s money, Crowley felt entitled to it “inasmuch as he waspersonally responsible for having supplied about nine tenths of the total amountof money on deposit.”219 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts01_r1.htm#c12-nts219] Itallowed him to support himself through the remainder of his time in America."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THIRTEENAMALANTRAHAlthough Chokmah days ticked by, Crowley, enjoying one boon after anotherthrough the summer of 1917, knew the worst of his trials had passed.

And Viereck appointedCrowley editor of The International with a $20-per-week salary. He firstappeared on the masthead as “contributing editor” with the August issue. In thetradition of The Equinox, Crowley wrote most of the magazine’s contents undervarious pseudonyms, publishing his Simon Iff and Golden Twigs stories along withpractical articles on magick, such as “The Revival of Magick,” “Cocaine,” “TheOuija Board,” “The Message of the Master Therion,” “Geomancy,” and “EcclesiaeGnosticae Catholicae Canon Missae” (the Gnostic Mass).3[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts003]For a short time, Crowley lived with a Pennsylvania Dutch woman named AnnaCatherine Miller. He met her at a Singalese restaurant on 8th Avenue and likenedher to the Egyptian god Anubis, the dog-headed underworld guide. He and the Dog,as AC dubbed her, took a furnished Central Park West apartment near 110thStreet. Miller was “the only member of her family not actually insane,”4[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts004] but she drank heavily, andwhen she proved unable to quit, Crowley left her. The last thing he wanted wasanother Rose Kelly or Mary Desti.Crowley promptly took up with Miller’s friend Roddie Minor (1884–1979). Standingfive-foot-eight with gray eyes and brown hair, she was “physically a magnificentanimal”5 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts005] with broad muscularshoulders and masculine features. She was born in Lawrenceville, Georgia, onApril 9, 1884, the third of four daughters to farmer William Jackson Minor andLide Hawthorne Minor.6 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts006] While astudent at Columbia University, she became active in winter 1908 in New York’ssuffrage movement, where she was described as a lieutenant to radical feministactivist Bettina Borrman Wells. When police refused to grant a parade permit fora Sunday demonstration, Minor told reporters, “If necessary to avoid themolestation of the police, we shall get a corpse and a coffin, or one of us willpretend she is dead, so that the procession will be a funeral march.”7[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts007] To avoid arrest, she was oneof eight who held a “silent march” up Broadway from Union Square to theManhattan Trade School, their numbers swelling to two thousand along the way.Encountering a crowd surrounding a Salvation Army band, Minor complained “Finejustice this. Here are persons in uniform, carrying banners and with a brassband. If they can parade, why can’t we?”8[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts008] The march resulted in Minor’sphotograph appearing in the papers under the headline “She Wants to Vote,” andwhen Borrman Wells and several of her people left New York to spread theirmessage elsewhere, Minor was placed in charge of the Progressive Woman SuffrageUnion headquarters.9 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts009][images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_056_r1.jpg]Roddie Minor, the Camel (1884–1979). (photo credit 13.1)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c13-fig001a]She graduated in 1911 from Columbia University’s New York College of Pharmacywith a Doctor of Pharmacy degree.10[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts010] The following year, she beganworking as a chemist for druggists and importers W. H. Schieffelin & Co., joinedthe American Pharmaceutical Association as a corresponding member, and helpedfound the American Women’s Pharmaceutical Association, serving as its vicepresident.11 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts011] She would soonleave her medical pathology laboratory job to become managing chemist for alarge perfume manufacturer.Because Crowley saw her carrying him out of a dry and desiccated period of hislife and into a comfortable phase, he dubbed her the Camel, although she went bythe nickname Eve. By early October, he was living with her in a West 9th Streetstudio. In these new surroundings, Crowley returned to the work of promulgatingthe Law of Thelema. Thus, 1918 began on a productive note: Crowley wrote “DeLege Libellum” (“The Law of Liberty”), revised his “Message of the MasterTherion,” and quickly published both tracts.It looked like it would be a typical Saturday night. It was pastmidnight—technically now Sunday, January 14. Eve lay on a mattress on the floor,smoking opium and muttering about this thing and that. Crowley, meanwhile,blocked out the distraction of her babbling as he worked at his desk writingLiber Aleph. Alternately known as The Book of Wisdom or Folly, Liber Aleph was aseries of epistles of a magician (the Magus To Mega Therion) to his magical son(the Magister Templi OIVVIO) covering a broad array of spiritual and magicaltopics. Its style was that of prose poetry. Each one-page epistle bore a Latintitle, with every noun in the book capitalized. Beginning as a challenge toFreud, it became one of his most elevated and sublime works.12[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts012]He set down his pen when the Camel muttered that she saw herself as acandlestick with thirteen candles. Crowley expounded on the number ninety-three(the value of the words thelema, will, and agape, love, among others),explaining how adepts had sent messages for him through his Scarlet Women andhow he tested these adepts and their messages. Then he returned to work.Eve interrupted again to explain that she was now thirteen naked women beingcaressed simultaneously. The image did nothing to distract him, nor did therecurrence of the number thirteen interest him. As he scribbled away, Crowleyoffhandedly suggested she try to obtain a message.Asking for a message, she heard gurgling water. A dark farmhouse appeared toher, transforming into an equally dark vagina, and then into a group of soldierswith guns surrounding an enthroned king. Roddie Minor asked for a clearermessage. In response, she saw a flesh-like egg with intricate convolutions,encircled with clouds, trees, mountains, and water—the four elements. A camelthen stepped into the foreground.Hearing her mention an egg, Crowley perked up, recalling it was an importantimage in the Abuldiz Working with Mary Desti. The camel, of course, was Roddie.She asked the king’s name, and the word Ham appeared. This Crowley interpretedas Khem, the ancient name of Egypt. When the king stood and walked off, agray-bearded wizard in a long black gown appeared. Looking back at Roddie, hetook the king’s arm and led him into a cave. She followed.“Tell them you’re Eve,” Crowley suggested. When she did, everything vanished.Roddie now found the king sitting in a canopy-covered niche in the mountainside.The wizard sat beneath a tree and fanned himself. Crowley urged her again to askthe king’s name. Despite her fear, Roddie asked. The king smiled, and sheunderstood she had to build a fire before he would speak. So the king and thewizard taught her the fire-building ritual. Once lit, she saw a beautiful lionbeside the blaze. The wizard, still holding a pair of sticks, smiled at her andsaid, “child.” A naked boy danced in the woods before them.Contented, the wizard sat and extended his hand toward her. Roddie accepted theinvitation, sitting at his left hand and watching the dancing boy. Tenderlyputting his arm around her, he rested her head on his shoulder and said, “It’sall in the egg.”The Beast and the Camel repeated their experiment of January 14 over the nextfew months, generally on weekends. It became Crowley’s longest, most detailedworking. The king, they learned, was Eosophon, and the boy was AugustusFionchare. The most important actor, however, proved to be the old wizard.“There was what I may call a permanent background to the vision,” Crowley saidof the workings,13 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts013] adding thatthe wizard “lived in a place as definite as an address in New York, and in thisplace were a number of symbolic images representing myself and several otheradepts.” His name was Amalantrah, and he proved himself to Crowley by providingthe elusive spelling of Baphomet (a thorny problem, since its etymology isunknown and its orthography suspect): As BAFOMETHR, it added up to Amalantrah’sown number, 729, and suggested the meaning “Father Mithras.”On January 25, Amalantrah showed the Camel a green multiarmed deity seated by adoor bearing the inscription “Gate of Abdullah” in strange characters. Beyondthis gate was the Marrakesh oasis of Oseika, where Roddie met the tall MoorAthanan.“What is my true number?” the Camel finally asked.“103,” Athanan answered.“What is my magical name?”“In my language, it is Ahitha.” This Crowley quickly tallied to 417. Both 103and 417 were one digit shy of being magically significant: 104 being the Hebrewletter Tzaddi, the fish hook, while 418 was the number of Abrahadabra, Aiwass,Heru-Ra-Ha, Ankh-f-n-Khonsu, and Nuit’s cry of “To me!”14[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts014] The lacking digit, Crowleydeduced, symbolized the phallus.During the discussion, Crowley began to ask about his plan to solicit supportfrom his friends to unify all occult groups. “Tell me if Annie Besant will livelong in her present body?”“Yes.”Damn. “Is a political campaign among existing occult societies with a view tounification under 666 a good plan?”“Yes.”“Should I approach Bert Reese?” Reese (1851–1926) was an American spiritualistwhom Crowley had met in London before the war. Aged in his sixties, he earned alucrative income consulting for wealthy businessmen.“Yes.”“Should I approach another person?” He was thinking of Ada Leverson.“No.”“Should I approach Gouraud?” This was Aimée Crocker Gouraud (1871–1941),daughter of Pacific Coast millionaire E. B. Crocker, who had helped finance theUnion Pacific Railroad. Born in Sacramento, she lived a colorful life wherevershe went, whether it was New York, France, England, or India. Author ofMoon-Madness and Other Fantasies,15[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts015] the Philadelphia Inquirerdescribed the Queen of Bohemia thus: “Call her a millionairess, an aesthete, agenius at bizarre and extravagant entertainment, a citizeness of many lands, adabbler in art and the occult, a seeker after weird adventure and you have notbegun to say it all.”16 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts016] Herpassport application listed her occupation simply as “capitalist.”17[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts017] She had married four times:her first two marriages ended in divorce, she was a widow to her third husbandJackson Gouraud, and in 1914 she married Prince Alexandre Miskinoff of Russia.18[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts018] Her interests in mysticism andthe occult caused her to embrace many religious traditions. Indeed, Crowley hadenrolled her into OTO prior to the war; she was one of the dedicatees of thepoem “The Disciples” in the last Equinox.19[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts019] Crowley unsuccessfully wooedher (and would continue to do so over the years). As her friend Leah Hirsigrecalled,He has proposed marriage to her nearly every time he has seen or written her forthe last ten years.She adores him; she realizes that he is far beyond any of her Russian counts andother suckers that fill her drawing-room; but she fears him. Some fortune tellertold her that her fifth marriage—if she contracted a fifth marriage—would be thedeath of her. 20 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts020]Ironically, Crowley’s main hindrance was that he always presented an air ofwealth while she preferred her men penniless.“Yes,” he agreed, AC should approach Gouraud.“Is there anyone else to approach?”“Some woman.” Athanan described an attractive, middle-aged American, stout andlarge-breasted, with chestnut hair and fair skin. Married but without children,she was educated, worked as a singer or musician, and knew Aimée Gouraud. Shelived near 5th Avenue. and her name was Elsie Gray Parker.Given enough information to search for this mysterious ally, Crowley asked aboutpractical matters. “When may Therion expect fulfillment of Liber Legis chapterthree, verse thirty-one?” This passage read, “There cometh a rich man from theWest who shall pour his gold upon thee.”“September.”“What year?”“1918.” Athanan would be wrong on this point.“What nationality is the man referred to in that verse?”“Austrian.” The rich man Crowley would eventually discover was German. He wasnot, however, a man of leisure as Athanan described. It was one of several deadends given by Amalantrah. Although Crowley would search for the mysterious ElsieGray Parker, he would never find her. And, despite Crowley’s soliciting the helpof Bert Reese, a union of magical orders did not occur.As the workings progressed, Crowley increasingly incorporated the IX°, anal sex,Anhalonium lewinii, and hashish in order to improve the connection. At thistime, Amalantrah assured Crowley that he could transliterate his motto, To MegaTherion, into Hebrew without losing its numerical value. (Try though Crowleymight, the wizard’s solution only added up to 740, not 666.)That very day, however, one reader of The International responded to Crowley’sessay, “The Revival of Magick,” which had run in the September and October,1917, issues. The inciteful passage read:“Herein is Wisdom; let him that hath understanding count the number of theBeast; for it is the number of a man; and his number is 600 & 3 score & 6.” [TOMEGA THERION], the Great Wild Beast, has the value, according to the Greeksystem, of 666. It is, of course, the title of the Master Therion.The letter (dated February 24, 1918) came to Viereck at The Internationaloffices, and read,Please inform your readers that I, Shmuel bar Aiwaz bie Yackou de Shirabad, havecounted the number of a man.Tau+ 400 + Resh + 300 + Yod + 10 + Vau + 6 + Nin + 50. Read from right to left.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_057_r1.jpg]A reader had sent in the solution to Amalantrah’s puzzle! Then he noticed thecorrespondent’s name: Samuel bar Aiwaz. All these years, Crowley thought thename of his holy guardian angel was artificial; in reality, it was a Hebrewname! Without hesitation, he dashed off a letter to the man, Shmuel bar Aiwazbie Yackou de Shirabad, who had Anglicized his name to Samuel A. Jacobs (c.1891–1971). Born in Persia, he came to America as a youth, and in 1909 became aprinter for the Persian Courier in New York, then designed and revised unusualtypefaces for the Mergenthaler Linotype Company. In future years, he wouldoperate the Golden Eagle Press in Mount Vernon, New York, and design books forCovici Friede, New Directions, Oxford University Press, and Dutton; his designfor Covici Friede’s 1930 edition of The Canterbury Tales was named one of the“Fifty Books of the Year” by the American Institute of Graphic Arts. However,his claim to fame may well be as designer of poetry books for e. e. cummings(1894–1962).21 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts021] When Crowleyresponded to his letter, he supplied Crowley with the spelling of Aiwaz: OIVZ.This Crowley anxiously tallied to the number ninety-three.The coincidence floored him: from a single man he received the Hebreworthography of Therion plus the traditional and numerically significant spellingof Aiwass as Aiwaz. Significantly, these were solutions that had eluded Crowley,the scribe of The Book of the Law. The importance of this event caused him towrite of Samuel A. Jacobs, “He is one of the most important links in the chainof evidence that superhuman intelligences really exist.”22[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts022][images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_058_r1.jpg]Samuel Aiwaz Jacobs (c. 1891–1971).

The first of these, Eva Tanguay(1878–1947), was the highest-paid vaudeville star of her time (at the time ofthe 1929 stock-market crash, she lost over $2 million). A “hoydenish,frizzy-haired blonde, celebrated for her animated delivery and her outlandish,often wildly feathered costumes,”23[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts023] she had been a performer sincechildhood, when she toured for five years portraying Cedric Errol in Little LordFauntleroy. Her voice was ordinary—Percy Hammond described it as “the wail ofthe prehistoric diplodocus”24[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts024]—but her energetic performancesmore than made up for it, inviting comparison to “a human dynamo.”25[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts025] Admittedly egotistical (hersongs included “T-A-N-G-U-A-Y” and “The Tanguay Rag”), she nevertheless parodiedherself in her hit “Egotistical Eva.” Her trademark song, however, mirrored herlifestyle and earned her the title of the “I Don’t Care” girl.26[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts026] And she truly didn’t care whatothers thought: she sang risqué songs (e.g. “It’s Been Done Before but Never theWay I Do It”) and had very public love affairs (she was linked to AfricanAmerican heavyweight champion Jack Johnson). When Crowley met her she was at thetop of her game, having just produced and starred in Energetic Eva (1916) andThe Wild Girl (1917).27 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts027] ACconsidered her a supreme artist, writing, “I have no words to hymn her glory,nay, not if I were Shelley and Swinburne and myself in one.”28[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts028] His appreciation of her,“Drama be Damned,” appears in the April 1918 International.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_059_r1.jpg]Singer Eva Tanguay (1878–1947).

A Russian immigrant fromOdessa, she became a U.S. citizen upon her April 17, 1913, marriage in Chicagoto Herman Roehling.29 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts029] Althoughshe made her home in Chicago, at the time she met Crowley she was traveling as alecturer on Russia. On May 23, 1917, she had addressed representatives of 125women’s organizations at a meeting of the League of Cook Country Clubs inChicago, speaking on the condition of Russia before and after prohibition,remarking, “The revolution never would have succeeded without prohibition. Ourpeasants had been encouraged to stupefy themselves with drink. When that wastaken away they could think better. The Russians have been forty years startinga real revolution, but when it came it was good.”30[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts030] From there, she lectured atMilwaukee-Downer College on Russian women, and on March 10, 1908, the EthicalCulture Society in Philadelphia.31[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts031] Standing five feet, six and ahalf inches tall with gray eyes, dark brown hair, and a fair complexion, hermagical name was Olun, after Plato’s Timaeus. Meaning “the whole of wholes” or“Absolute Whole,” Crowley connected it to Nuit, Our Lady of the Stars. Shortlyafter meeting her, Crowley took her as his new Scarlet Woman, noting that Olunand Marie both added to 156, the number of Babalon. Her name appears throughoutLiber Aleph. Although by March 22 Crowley had her and Roddie Minor together inbed with him doing magick to cure Marie’s “sin complex” and Roddie’s jealousy,Olun “soon abandoned the unequal contest.”32[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts032] When reprinting his Russianmemoir The Fun of the Fair nearly three decades later, Crowley would name heramong the dedicatees.Completing the triad was Dorothy A. Troxel (1896–1986), a musician who held anassociate of music degree from Dana School in her native Warren, Ohio. ACcultivated her as a magical partner at the request of Amalantrah, who dubbed herWesrun; depending on the spelling, her name was either 333 (dispersion) or 888(redemption), making Crowley feel obligated to save her. Thirty years later, asa geographic names specialist with the Army Map Service, she would begin thefive-year project of compiling the first modern Mongolian-English dictionary.33[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts033]Besides this trinity of scorpions, a fourth woman figured into the AmalantrahWorking: Mrs. Elsa Lowensohn Lincke (b. 1864),34[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts034] who reputedly introduced thecabaret to America.35 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts035] A Germanmusician who had lived in New York since 1904, she was described by Crowley as“antique, but sprightly” and as having “abandoned worldly pleasures forspiritual joys.” She had been interested in H. Spencer Lewis36[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts036] and his Rosicrucian group,Ancient and Mystical Order Rosæ Crucis (AMORC), “merrily disdainful of criticismbased on his elementary blunders in Latin and his total ignorance of the historyof the Order which he claimed to rule. The old lady was simple-minded, sincereand earnest.”37 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts037] She helped theorder by giving AC money for the Great Work. Amalantrah dubbed her Bazedon,calling her totem a toad and her numeral 444 (significantly, 444 was the numberof the frog-headed god of the earth).On March 30, 1918, Frater Achad, having sold all his possessions to be by hismaster’s side, arrived from Vancouver. He assumed the magical name Arcteon,which Amalantrah had given earlier as the name of an unborn prophet of the Law.Besides helping Crowley interrogate the wizard, he also helped prepare the newEquinox, and participated in a series of experiments with ether.Disaster struck in April, when Viereck transferred ownership of TheInternational to Dr. Lindley Miller Keasbey (1867–1946), the former chair of theUniversity of Texas Department of Economics and Political Science and anauthority on international law. The previous summer, he had been dismissed forhis pro-German pacifist activism in forming the People’s Council for Democracyand Terms of Peace and lecturing across the country on its behalf.38[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts038] Although Crowley dedicated“Concerning the Law of Thelema”39[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts039] to him, Keasbey refused toinclude his work in future issues. This caused Crowley to accuse Keasbey ofmismanagement; any trouble at the paper, however, Viereck attributed toCrowley’s tendency to publish his own writings in favor of contributions bytalented new writers.The Amalantrah Working nevertheless proceeded, with new assistants arriving inMay. Operations continued until June 16, when Crowley, satisfied that he andRoddie had built the Temple of Jupiter, ended the Amalantrah Working.That July, another pilgrim sought Crowley in New York. Cecil Frederick Russell(1897–1987) was a “surly, mulish and bitterly rebellious”40[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts040] attendant at an Annapolisnaval hospital who, having saved his earnings to purchase The Equinox for $100,was memorizing the Holy Books. Russell was born in Greenwood, Massachusetts, onJune 9, 1897.41 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts041] His familylater moved to Orlando, Florida, and two months short of his twentieth birthday,Russell enlisted in the U.S. Navy. Serving from April 22, 1917, to December 12,1918, Russell began as a Hospital Apprentice stationed at the U.S. Naval AcademyHospital in Annapolis, Maryland, and also aboard the USS Reina Mercedes. By 1918he had advanced to the office of Pharmacist Mate.42[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts042] He wrote Crowley at TheInternational, arranging a visit where he and Crowley ate lunch and took anastral journey; that evening, Crowley and his local OTO officers initiated himto the III°. His amazing ability and exceptional energy, Crowley thought, werewell-suited to the Great Work, and he was likewise anxious to help the cause.Alas, duty called him back to Annapolis for the time being.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_060_r1.jpg]Cecil Frederick Russell (1897–1987). (photo credit 13.5)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c13-fig005a]The following month, AC’s relationship with Roddie Minor ended. Although Crowleyclaimed to treat her as an equal in all respects, she nevertheless feltinferior. He attributed the resulting friction and resentment to the Vision ofthe Demon Crowley, a phrase he used to describe the phenomenon where everystudent at one point or another saw him as a horrible monster; those who enduredwould see beyond the illusion and know him as a great teacher, while thosefrightened off by this smoke screen recalled him superficially as a beast. InRoddie Minor’s case, she and Crowley talked the matter out, agreeing calmly andamicably to part.August’s dog days found Crowley feeling lost without The International, RoddieMinor, and Amalantrah. So he stood at the dock, surrounded by friends, waitingfor a morning Albany boat to carry him to his latest Great Magical Retirement onEsopus Island, near the Catskills Mountains on the Hudson River. According toreporter William Seabrook, his only baggage was the tent and canoe that Seabrookhad donated to him, plus provisions purchased with a monetary gift fromSeabrook. The reporter, however, was disgruntled to discover AC’scurious-looking luggage containing not food but brushes, rope, and fifty gallonsof paint. Crowley had only $2.25 left to his name. “For crying out loud,”Seabrook reportedly sniped, contemplating shoving AC into the river, “what areyou going to eat?” With a grand, pontifical gesture, Crowley affected theembodiment of his father. “My children, I will be fed as Elijah by the ravens.”Crowley, reading Seabrook’s account twenty-five years later, clarified,the story about going up the Hudson in a canoe loaded with red paint. It wasloaded with camping apparatus and supplies, of course. What else would anexplorer do? The paint (I think about four pots of it) was bought at a localshop after I had been living on the island for a month.43[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts043]Crowley arrived at the island, pitching his tent and sitting in his asana.Realizing that since coming to America his emphasis on sex magick was adetriment to his other disciplines, he took this opportunity to refine hisskills in meditation and concentration. He often sat for hours before realizingsomeone had left food for him. The milk, eggs, and sweet corn came not fromravens but local farmers who, though uncertain whether Crowley was a sage or apsycho, decided he needed to eat.Combining yoga and drugs produced an intense series of trances that he believedrecalled his past lives. Working back from his last incarnation as Frenchoccultist Éliphas Lévi (1810–1875), who died six months before Crowley’s birth,he relived memories as Count Cagliostro, Edward Kelly, and Pope Alexander VI.Among his less illustrious incarnations were a suicide, a Polish scholar, andthe monk Father Ivan. In one dismal life he was a deformed hermaphrodite who,conquering tuberculosis and scoliosis, died from syphilis after a German knightraped him. In Mohammedean times, he served on a council of Secret Chiefs who,despite the skepticism of older masters, revealed the Mysteries to mankindthrough Mohammed, Luther, Adam Weishaupt, Christian Rosenkreuz, and similarteachers. In a much earlier incarnation, he was Ko Hsuen, a disciple of Lao Tzu,author of the King Khang King. While basking in the illumination of thesememories, Crowley prepared “translations” of the Chinese classics Tao Teh Kingand King Khang King—actually enlightened paraphrases of James Legge.Subjected to empirical rigors, these memories are unconvincing. In the case ofwell-known figures, his “recollections” contain obscure or unverifiable details;sometimes they even conflict with known facts. For example, Crowley recalledCagliostro being born not in Palermo but in a Tunisian brothel, and dying not asa prisoner of the Inquisition at San Leo but in a mountain forest with a gailydressed youth. Despite their empirical failings, Crowley attached greatsignificance to these memories and claimed to benefit from them.Even greater illumination came on September 5 when, at 5 p.m., he recorded inhis diary,The meditation of this afternoon resulted in an initiation so stupendous that Idare not hint at its Word. It is the supreme secret of a Magus, and it is soawful that I tremble even now—two hours later and more … as I write concerningit. In a single instant I had the Key to the whole of the Chinese wisdom. In thelight—momentary glimpse as it was—of this truth, all systems of religion andphilosophy became absolutely puerile. Even the Law [of Thelema] appears no morethan a curious incident. I remain absolutely bewildered, blinded, knowing whatblasting image lies in this shrine.44[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts044]Following this vision, he used the rope he had brought to make rigging by whichto dangle from the cliffs facing the Hudson. Upon these cliffs, plainly visibleto passing steamers, Crowley painted in large red letters:DO WHAT THOU WILT SHALL BE THE WHOLE OF THE LAW EVERY MAN AND EVERY WOMAN IS ASTARBy the time he left Esopus Island, Crowley realized that the magical currentthat had fueled his American period had depleted itself. The time had come towrap up business and move on.Tan and trim, Crowley returned to New York early that September and took aone-room studio at 1 University Place on the corner of Washington Square, hidinghis bed behind a triptych screen whose panels he painted as sun, moon, and fire.Boasting to Seabrook of his newfound magical skills, he encountered onlyskepticism and so arranged a demonstration: walking down 5th Avenue, he assumedthe slouched posture of a well-to-do gentleman and fell into step behind him. Asan example of sympathetic magic, AC adapted the man’s mannerisms so stronglythat when Crowley dropped briefly to a squat, the gentleman in front of him fellto the ground. Seabrook and Crowley helped the puzzled fellow to his feet as hesearched vainly for a banana peel or something slick on the soles of his shoes.Also at this time, Crowley made the stunning announcement that he was now apainter. “My familiar spirit visited me in the night and commanded me to paint,”he told Willie. “I have been under the misapprehension that I was a great poet.I was clearly mistaken. Paint is my real medium, and I am destined to become oneof the outstanding artists of my age.”45[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts045] Alas, his skill remained poordespite diligent work. He eventually confided in Seabrook, “I am certain Aiwasshas something important to express through paint, but he doesn’t know a thingabout technique!” So Willie took him to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, whereCrowley spent the day studying Rembrandt’s “Old Woman.” Then he understoodpainting.While this tale of Crowley’s artistic awakening is courtesy of Seabrook, Crowleyhimself gives an explanation that sheds more light on the origins of thisinterest:I probably would never have taken up painting if it hadn’t been for theInternational, of which I became editor. I couldn’t find artists who would drawthe covers I wanted, so, finally I became disgusted about fifteen months ago anddecided to draw my own covers. I had never studied art and had never drawn orpainted a picture in my life. When I tried to draw those covers I became sointerested in the work that I gave up the editorship of the magazine and went infor art.46 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts046]None of Crowley’s concepts, however, ever covered the magazine.To locate models for his unusual and often grotesque pictures, Crowley ran thefollowing ad in the newspaper:WANTEDDWARFS, HUNCHBACKS, Tattooed Women, Harrison Fisher Girls, Freaks of All Sorts,Coloured Women only if exceptionally ugly or deformed, to pose for artist. Applyby letter with photograph.He drew preliminary sketches of his subjects, mixed pigments, and “began topaint the amazing pictures that have come to be the despair of art critics hereand abroad.”47 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts047] Though anunskilled draughtsman, the haunting quality of his pictures neverthelessattracted acclaim from New York’s ultramodernists.While S. L. Mathers died that November in the worldwide Spanish flu epidemic,Crowley nurtured two ambitions, as described in a letter to author James BranchCabell (1879–1962):I am just off to Detroit to give three lectures—Labour, Religion, and Death—andthence by the Beard of the Prophet to a Free Country. I am trying to find anAbbey of Thelema for free men.48[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts048]The latter ambition involved starting a utopian society based upon Thelemicprinciples, inspired by Rabelais’s Abbey of Thélème for his own law of “Do whatthou wilt.” Its first tentative steps, however, remained more than a year away.More pressing was Crowley’s visit to Detroit, which would figure prominently inhis plans during 1918–1919, both for publication and establishment of OTO’s U.S.headquarters.His link to Detroit was Albert Winslow Ryerson (1872–1931), general manager ofUniversal Book Stores Inc. Born in Hollis, New Hampshire, to John and EvelynRyerson, who traced their family back to the Mayflower, Ryerson was raised inConcord, where he drove a dog cart for his neighbor, transcendentalistphilosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–1882). From Emerson and his distinguishedvisitors,49 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts049] he acquired a keeninterest in philosophy and the ancients’ worship of sex. As he explainedobliquely:Why it was my father who took the wild grape and the Isabella together, the maleand the female and they formed the present Concord grape. Father introduced themthere was no engagement, they were married, he married them, and I assume theConcord grape must have been a love grape. This school of philosophy is the samethat Thoreau and all those people believed in where they delved into the finestthings of nature. It was in that atmosphere that I was reared and thatatmosphere surrounded me and which in a measure determined or directed my life.And many of these fine people, because of the libelous press, have to go intohiding to think and talk about these finer things, which give great truths tothe world. Of course in such an atmosphere there were so-called “love cults,”but in this school there were people of high ideals.50[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts050]He later moved to Boston, where in 1893 he married Vida E. F. Marsh, with whomhe had three children: Martin Albert, Grace Louise, and Winslow George. In 1896he moved to Detroit and introduced there the ninety-nine-year lease. He workedas a representative for an eastern rubber company; while traveling for work, hespent years building up an inventory of unusual books in order to start abookstore.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_061_r1.jpg]Albert Winslow Ryerson (1872–1931), proprietor of the Universal Book Stores.(photo credit 13.6) [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c13-fig006a]He was an active Mason, claiming membership at Detroit’s Free and AcceptedMasonic Lodge No. 2. He was also a knight of the Detroit Commandery No. 1 andheld the 32° with the Michigan Sovereign Consistory of the Ancient and AcceptedScottish Rite.51 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts051] Through hisMasonic Lodge, Ryerson met two men who were interested in partnering in hisbookstore: Gordon Hill and Hugh Jack. Gordon W. Hill (1883–1971) was a dentalsurgery student from Windsor, Ontario, who took his Craft degrees at Detroit’sLotus Lodge No. 549 in 1909 and shared Ryerson’s esoteric interests.52[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts052] Reverend Hugh Jack (1864–1949)took his Craft degrees at Dearborn Lodge No. 172 in May 1906; he was theIrish-born pastor of Central Presbyterian Church, and would receive an honorarydoctor of laws degree from Dubuque College in June 1918.53[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts053] As Ryerson recalled hisDecember 1917 purchase of Homer W. Adair’s bookstore at 131 Grand River Avenue:The Universal Book Store was formed for the purpose of handling all kinds ofreligious literature, all over the country, or the world, with everything thatwas odd or out of the way. We did not specialize in any one thing, to make itsacred, but bought anything that had to it any great amount of religion,consequently the stores became phenomenally successful.54[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts054]Hill was president, Jack vice president, and Ryerson general manager.Before long they opened two other branches in the city and a third in Toledo,Ohio. In July 1918, Maryland native William A. Gibson (born c. 1874), aneducator with the auto industry,55[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts055] came onboard as theirtreasurer. The following month, Ryerson took Gibson on a book-buying tripthrough New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore to stock up their newstore and show him the ropes. It was on this trip that they met Crowley.56[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts056]Ryerson was already familiar with Crowley’s works and quite eager to meet himwhen their travels brought them to New York in early October 1918. Arranging ameeting, however, proved challenging. They arrived at what they thought wasCrowley’s address only to discover that he had moved; although the staff knewhis new whereabouts, they were unwilling to say. Ultimately the janitor directedthem to Crowley’s regular lunch spot at the Brevoort Hotel on 5th Avenue. Therethey left a note and, a couple of days later, received an invitation to meetwith Crowley’s intermediary, Jones, who would determine if they could talk toCrowley. After meeting Jones, he took them downtown to see Crowley face-to-face.These cloak-and-dagger activities, coupled with Jones’s attitude, convincedGibson that Crowley “was under police surveillance; he could not go out in theopen because of the police.”57 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts057]Ryerson, however, understood things differently:Mr. Crowley was the accredited agent of the British Government in the employ oftheir Secret Service Department. That was one of the reasons why it was alwaysso difficult to get in touch with him. German spies were continually after him,and he would never allow anyone to see him, unless he first knew who theywere.58 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts058]In addition to Crowley, Jones, Ryerson, and Gibson, two women also attended themeeting. One was “some sort of lecturer in connection with some Russian movementor propaganda,”59 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts059] i.e. MarieRoehling. The other was English, the wife of a British vice consul.60[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts060] Although unidentified, shewould appear to be Helen Hall, wife of Frederick Hall: both arrived in New Yorkon September 1, 1917.61 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts061]According to Spence, Mr. Hall was posing as a journalist as a cover for hisintelligence work out of Guy Gaunt’s offices at 44 Whitehall.62[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts062] As Crowley reported withrespect to his own intelligence work, “There was a Temporary Gentleman namedH … l in the British Military Mission with whom I had such dealings as ispossible with the half-witted.”63[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts063] Completing the puzzle is anote attached to Crowley’s painting from this period, La Femme de Chez Moi:“This cannot be described for fear of a consular scandal. For particulars, applyto Mr. Hall of the British Mission.”64[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts064]Crowley’s recollections indicate that more than bookselling was on the agenda;his OTO work had generated interest amongst Detroit Freemasons:The accounts of the new Rite made a great impression; and in particular,attracted the attention of the Supreme Grand Council, Sovereign Grand InspectorsGeneral of the 33rd and Last Degree of the Scottish Rite in the Valley ofDetroit, Mich. This Council deputed two Princes of the Royal Secret from theConsistory dependent from their jurisdiction to interview me in New York.65[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts065]Crowley “offered to reorganize freemasonry, to replace the pomposities andbanalities of their ragbag of rituals by a simple, lucid and coherent system,”66[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts066] and Ryerson believed hisfellow Masons back in Detroit would be equally excited. Crowley, however, wasuninterested in discussing the particulars of OTO with anyone but thehighest-ranking Freemasons of his coterie, remarking, “It was of courseimpossible for me to deal with subordinates, and I refused to discuss the matterexcept with Sovereign Grand Inspectors General [33°].”67[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts067]In all, Ryerson had three meetings with Crowley early that October. The resultwas an agreement to market the next volume of The Equinox, an informal agreementto accept on consignment the Crowley rariora that John Quinn hadn’t purchased,and an invitation for Crowley to come to Detroit. Ryerson embracedThelema … evidently to the detriment of his marriage, as his wife, Vida, filedfor divorce shortly thereafter, writing in her complaint:The defendant by his acts and declarations appears to be possessed of areligious conviction that he is not bound longer to recognize any of theconventions or formalities of society, but insists that he is free to conducthimself according to the dictates of his own conscience.68[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts068]Ryerson soon found a lover in Bertha Almira Bruce, a feisty and independentwoman who shared his perspective on sexual freedom. Born in Kansas around 1889,she was proprietor of a rooming house on 381 West Grand Boulevard.69[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts069] She was also the “financialangel” of the publishing venture, loaning money to both him and the UniversalBook Stores to help with their projects.While Ryerson returned to Detroit, Crowley made arrangements to print TheEquinox. In November 1918 he received a quote from New York’s DeVinne Press totypeset, print, and bind the volume for $4,050 with a promised delivery date ofMarch 21, 1919: the vernal equinox, perfectly concluding the publication’s “fiveyears of silence.” Crowley gave the printer the contents to set, and he had acover design in mind. By January he was working out details of the inserts,which included color plates, black and white photographs, and line drawings.Since he was so busy with the printers, Crowley sent his Deputy Grand MasterGeneral (Jones) to Detroit to generate interest in The Equinox and prepare toestablish OTO in Detroit.The timing couldn’t have been better. In early November, Gibson resigned astreasurer-accountant for the bookstore. Although he later pointed to hisdisapproval of Crowley and the way Ryerson “toadied” up to him,70[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts070] the real reason, according toRyerson, was that his demand for a half interest in the bookstore was denied. Inresponse, Gibson emptied their bank accounts, took some of the merchandise, andstarted his own mail-order business.71[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts071] Fortunately, Jones had justarrived in Detroit, representing the public accounting firm of A. E. Duncan.Ryerson hired him as their new accountant.Jones wasted no time in getting to work. Arriving early on Sunday morning,February 16, 1919, he just made a 10:30 a.m. meeting with Ryerson at the store.Later that day, he took a furnished apartment at 108-75 Sibley Street. He beganwork the next morning, and after work met at the law offices of Frank T. Lodge(1859–1930). Born in Indiana, Lodge relocated to Michigan, where he became PastGrand Master of Michigan’s Grand Lodge of Freemasonry, a Sovereign GrandInspector General (33°) in the Scottish Rite, and was now the presumptive leaderof the embryonic OTO group in Michigan. He was the author of Why WeepestThou?,72 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts072] which he wrote andpublished in 1913 in his grief over the loss of his wife, Gemma, twenty-sevenyears his junior. In terms reserved for those who angered or disappointed him,Crowley wrote, “Their leader, for all his fine talk, had only one real desire—tocommunicate with his dead wife, a silly smirking society waxwork, a pink-teaprincess!”73 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts073] Whatever Lodge’smotives, Jones emerged from the office with a signed contract from the UniversalBook Stores for two thousand copies of latest Equinox.Ryerson initially planned to order five hundred copies of The Equinox. WhenJones produced two hundred orders from OTO members as far away as Europe,Canada, and Mexico, this convinced Ryerson that they could sell more. Plus, thelarger order would mean a bigger wholesale discount. He later scaled his offerto take the entire two-thousand-copy print down to a more reasonable onethousand copies. In exchange, the book would show “Universal Publishing Company”on the title page. The name was merely a pseudonym for the Universal Book Storesto facilitate mail-order sales.74[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts074]Jones’s meeting with Lodge also concerned the establishment of a Supreme GrandCouncil of OTO. Discussions of this undertaking had begun with Crowley as earlyas November 1918. Because OTO had its origins in high degree Freemasonry,however, the similarity of its rituals made the Detroit Masons uncomfortable. AsCrowley recounted,However, when it came to the considerations of the practical details of therituals to be worked, the general Council of the Scottish Rite could not see itsway to tolerate them, on the ground that the symbolism in some places touchedtoo nearly that of the orthodox Masonry of the Lodges.… In order to meet theseviews, it was suggested that I should re-write the rituals in an entirely newsymbolism, which would in no way be considered as in competition with theaccepted ritual of the Craft.75[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts075]Thus, on November 23, 1918, Jones had written to W. T. Smith, “There is apossibility that the rituals may be revised, and the Words of the first TwoDegrees correctly given, and the Masonic connection made less in evidence.”76[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts076] In a letter to Jones thatFebruary, Crowley himself wrote, “I am then determined to revise the rituals ofthe OTO in such a sense that they will not conflict in any way with the Masonicideals.”77 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts077]After a while, Universal Book Stores’ stockholders, initially enthusiastic aboutthe deal, developed reservations because they didn’t understand The Equinox’scontents; Ryerson assured them that, as an occult book, it would have a readymarket. Just over two weeks before the release date, he reported to Crowley onMarch 4, 1919, “Our work is stirring up the opposition of the churches.”78[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts078] Crowley’s light-hearted replyoffered little solace:Cheer up little book store, don’t you cry;You will be a barroom bye and bye,Where the Right Wine of Iacchus will be dispensed.79[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts079]Ryerson’s mistress, Bertha Bruce, whom Crowley shared during his visits toDetroit, became his next Scarlet Woman. She was the presumptive priestess of theDetroiters’ Gnostic Mass, and known locally as “Bruce of the OTO.” To her,Crowley wrote the following lines:AlmiraTo Bertha Almira BruceStrong poison of thy mouth, my love, faint amber of thy breath,A fierce red wine that sucks me down a drunkard into death.Snake of my soul, thou leapest up to feed upon my brainThat thrills and sobs wild music to the murder-lust refrain!Come, there’s a tent pitched on the sand; the camel-bells ring clear;The stars are violent like young suns—I will to have thee here.Why linger in the moody north? There’s welcome in the south.Strong poison of thy mouth, my love, strong poison of thy mouth.Detroit, 191880 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts080]Two summers later, while living in Cefalù, Crowley was still thinking of this“sexual and magical partner,” counting her as the fifth of his five ScarletWomen to date, writing “Almira, whose vocation I cannot doubt, seems to havefailed altogether, unless she gave me that very non-attachment I so needed. ButI cannot make out whether she is still in office.”81[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts081] That office would next befilled by Leah Hirsig (1883–1975).On their first meeting, Hirsig was simply tagging along with her older sister,Marian Dockerill,82 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts082] who hadpreviously met AC at one of his lectures. As he described the lecture, “Among myhearers was only one bearing even a remote resemblance to the human species, anold lady painted to resemble the cover of a popular magazine.”83[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts083] This “old lady” was actuallythree years younger than Crowley and had previously been involved in several ofwhat she would call “love cults.” Her sister Leah was a thin woman with a boyishfigure, standing five-foot-eight in height. Crowley felt an irresistible urge todraw close and kiss her on the lips. To his surprise, she offered no resistance.In fact, she liked it. While Crowley did his best to participate in aconversation with her sibling, he found himself unable to do much more than rainkisses upon Leah. Her sister nearly had to pry them apart when the time came toleave.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_062_r1.jpg]Brooklyn schoolteacher Leah Hirsig (1883–1975). (photo credit 13.7)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c13-fig007a]That was in the spring of 1918. Hirsig called on Crowley a second time threeseasons later, on January 11, 1919. She was attending law classes at New YorkUniversity and wanted Crowley’s advice on Greenwich Village accommodations. Thistime they spoke, and Crowley learned she was thirty-six years old, born on April9, 1883, at Trachselwald in Berne, Switzerland. She was the youngest of tenchildren born to Magdalena Lüginbühl (1845–1923) and Gottlieb Hirsig(1844–1933).84 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts084] Her father wasa drunkard and her mother fled with her children to New York City in April 1885when Leah was age two. Her siblings now lived in places as remote asSwitzerland, New York, Florida, and Argentina. At age twenty-one she became anelementary school teacher of music. When Crowley met her, she was teaching atPublic School No. 40, located in the Bronx at Prospect Avenue and JenningsStreet.85 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts085] On November 13,1917, she gave birth in Florida to Hans Hammond (1917–1985), whom Leah namedafter her brother. Hans Hammond was purportedly the son of Edward Jack Hammond,whom Leah said died around the same time.86[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts086] Crowley, however, reports thatthe boy’s father was actually someone named Edward Carter;87[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts087] if so, then this person maywell be related to Samuel S. Carter (1864–1951) of St. Petersburg, Florida, whoshortly thereafter married Leah’s sister, Fanny.88[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts088] Whatever the story, Leah’s sonlived in Florida with his aunt and uncle while his mother sent what she couldfrom her earnings to support him.When they finished talking, Crowley walked up to Leah and undressed her. As whenhe first kissed her, she offered no resistance. “Let her be shameless beforemen,” Crowley recalled Aiwass’s description of the Scarlet Woman from The Bookof the Law. He looked at her naked body: a lean-hipped, small-breasted, andslender form surmounted by a wedge-shaped face adorned with large warm eyes andsupple lips. They made love, and afterward Crowley, feeling awkward with hisforward approach, took up his sketchbook. “What shall I paint you as?” he asked.“Paint me as a dead soul.”The night offered Crowley no repose. Images of Leah as a dead soul filled hisrestless mind. Sleepless, he left bed to examine his sketch and discovered that,standing the dead soul vertically, he saw it in a new light. In a spasm ofinspiration, he worked till dawn to paint his Dead Souls on a trifold screen.The center panel depicted Leah, ghastly, emaciated, and green; a gross, admiringwoman flanked her left and a huddled, agonized woman her right. Disfigured headslittered the bottom of all three screens. It pleased him.In an interview with an Atlanta-area newspaper, Crowley gave a different accountof this painting’s genesis, doubtlessly tailored to make better copy:I walked up to a blank canvas one day and, standing very close to it, I placedthe wet brush before it and shut my eyes. I had no preconceived idea of what Iwas going to paint. My hand simply moved automatically over the canvas.I don’t know how long I worked in that subconscious way, but you can imagine myastonishment when I found that I had painted a likeness of a friend whom Ihadn’t seen in many years. It was that person’s dead soul I had painted.89[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts089]Although lacking veracity (for example, Crowley hadn’t yet known Leah foryears), this version sheds new light on the Dead Soul’s oft-repeated origin.When Leah visited later that day, Crowley kissed and stripped her again,powerless to repress the attraction between them. He did a banishing ritual andconsecrated her as his Scarlet Woman. Shortly thereafter, he and Leah moved intolarger accommodations on the third floor of 63 Washington Square South,overlooking 5th Avenue.90 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts090]In February the press interviewed Crowley in his studio to promote an exhibitionof his art at Greenwich Village’s Liberal Club, the epicenter of New York’sbohemian scene and dubbed “A Meeting Place for Those Interested in New Ideas.”The Fort Wayne Journal-Gazette called him “The newest sensation in GreenwichVillage.” Neatly dressed and groomed, however, Crowley did not look like astereotypical artist; and his art was anything but conventional. The SyracuseHerald captured the effect of first entering the room:The walls of this studio are covered with the wildest maelstrom of untamed andunrelated colors ever confined under one roof. They look like a collisionbetween a Scandinavian sunset and a paint-as-you-please exhibit of theIndependent Artists association.The effect is riotous, blinding—but not distressing, after one gets used to it.Mr. Crowley helps one to do that, with a dash of cognac, an imported cigaretteand a delightful personality.“Study art?” he told the reporter. “Never have and never intend to. What sort ofartist am I? Oh, I don’t know just what to call myself. I’d say, off-hand, thatI was an old master, because I’m a painter mostly of dead souls.” AlthoughCrowley does not acknowledge the influence, his concept of painting “dead souls”is clearly influenced by the psychochromes or soul-paintings of Leon EngersKennedy; Crowley’s approach, however, was decidedly different.His method involved approaching the canvas with his eyes closed; next, as heexplained to the Wilkes-Barre Times, his hand, moving automatically, “wandersinto the realm of dead souls and very frequently the result is the likeness ofsome living person.” Elaborating, Crowley remarked, “But please, whatever youdo, don’t call me a cubist or a futurist or anything queer like that. I guessyou might call me a subconscious impressionist, or something on that order. Myart really is subconscious and automatic.” When the Evening World magazine askedabout the Vanity Fair biography that praised him as a great poet and explorer,Crowley lamented, “Alas, he had me all wrong. My only claim to distinction is asa painter.”Significantly, these interviews included descriptions of, and Crowley’s commentson, several pieces from this period: A Day Dream of Dead Hats depicted “a ladyasleep on a veranda, while the spirits of bygone bonnets pass over a mysticbridge on the heads of a dozen undressed ladies.” Crowley explained, “Most womendream of dead bonnets when they take a nap.” Of his watercolor The Burmese Lady,he remarked, “If you look at it closely you will discover that it is none otherthan our old friend, Bennett.” Pointing to another, he said, “That fluffy onedancing on one toe is supposed to be the dead spirit of Eva Tanguay.” Of hislarge three-paneled Screen of the Dead Souls. Crowley said,All those figures you see on it are dead souls in various stages ofdecomposition. That central figure in the middle panel is the queen of the deadsouls. Of course you recognized the head looking over her shoulder. That’sHearst. Over her other shoulder is Oscar Wilde. I don’t know how he got inthere, because I really hate him. The parrot sitting on the head of the deadlady’s soul in the third panel is one that belongs to Bob Chanler.91[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts091]He also had a story for his painting of French actress Madame Yorska92[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts092] with her head thrown backward,a jeweled dagger in her throat:I got that impression at some affair given in Greenwich Village at which acertain violinist played. Madame Yorska was there. The violinist, in renderingone striking piece, asked that the lights be turned low. While he was playing Isaw Madame Yorska throw her head back and close her eyes. I carried theimpression of that long white throat home with me. I tried to sleep butcouldn’t. During the night I got up and going to the canvas closed my eyes andthat picture was the result.Asked about the dagger, Crowley explained “Oh, that long sweeping white line ofthroat had to be cut somewhere, and I couldn’t think of any better way to cut athroat than with a dagger. So I stuck the knife into it. Rather good effect, Ithink.” Other works on display for the press included Ella Wheeler Wilcox andthe Swami (“One of my best works, that”), Is This the Face That Launched aThousand Ships? (“something I did in rather a hurry”),93[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts093] and Young Bolshevik Girl withWart Looking at Trotsky. “My pictures look more beautiful,” Crowley instructed,“if you look at them with your eyes closed.”94[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts094]Limousines carried uptown passengers to the premiere of Crowley’s parade ofgrotesque figures and landscapes in the salon. Here, they found the smilingartist decked out in a lemon waistcoat with knickers. While viewers remarkedambiguously, “Oh, how symbolic!” even the conservative members of the club, waryof hosting someone as notorious as Crowley, could find nothing immoral oroffensive in the twenty-three pencil and chalk drawings, forty-eightwatercolors, and twenty oils.“Dear Mr. Crowley,” an older woman asked about the piece titled May Morn, “won’tyou please explain the meaning of this picture?” Set in a large field, thepainting depicted an ecstatic woman dancer, a corpse hanging by a noose from adead tree, and a bearded figure peeking from behind the tree. It was Crowley’sinterpretation of the demise of Christianity.“Certainly, madam. The painting represents the dawn of a day following awitches’ celebration as described in Faust. The witch is hanged, as shedeserves, and the satyr looks out from behind a tree. In the background, all isa beautiful spring and a nymph dances joyously to the piping of a shepherd.”Satisfied, she smiled and replied, “How very charming!”95[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts095]Back at the Universal Book Stores, Jones was in charge of sales and marketingfor The Equinox. He did his best to stir up interest in Thelema and the works ofthe Master Therion, giving lectures for sympathetic audiences. The Friday afterhis arrival in February, Jones gave a talk on kabbalah to the TS. He soonstarted a Sunday afternoon study group on the then-unpublished Liber Aleph. Healso began a series of weekly Monday lectures at the Universal Book Stores,beginning with a lesson on astral journeys. He promoted these talks with a flyerwhose flipside advertised The Equinox. 96[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts096] In addition, he began holdingprivate meetings at his apartment on other weeknights. Before long he wasteaching four days out of the week. On one Friday night, he lectured on “Easternand Western Methods of Attainment” to a crowd of 150 at the Rosebud Club.97[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts097] Another speaker at the store’sWoodward Avenue location was a man named Russell;98[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts098] this may well have been C. F.Russell, who is recorded in the 1920 census as living at the same address asJones.The official organ of theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]proclaimed the Law of Thelema at the price of $6.66 per copy when Volume III,Number 1 of The Equinox went on sale that spring. Nicknamed the “blue Equinox”for the color of its cover, the book contained, according to Crowley, “acomplete programme of my proposed Operation to initiate, emancipate and relievemankind,”99 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts099] including asyllabus ofA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]instructions, various tracts on Thelema, and many organizational and historicaldocuments of OTO. Among these was “Liber LII,” the revised OTO Manifesto, whichCrowley considered singularly important.Liber LII was difficult to compose, but I was so sick of the stacks of diplomasthat people sent me from all parts of the world it was plainly unpractical. So Idid what the Alexandria crowd did with all the confused and confusing religionsof the period: lumped them anyhow and called it Christianity.100[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts100]The issue also contained “Hymn to Pan,” “The Sevenfold Sacrament,” “The Book ofthe Heart Girt with the Serpent,” and the Gnostic Mass. Corresponding to “TheTemple of Solomon the King” from the first volume of The Equinox was “A Masterof the Temple,” the first installment of an account of Frater Achad’s magicalcareer up to the grade of Magister Templi (8°=3°). Achad also contributed theessay, “Stepping out of the Old Aeon into the New.” Finally, the supplementcontained H. P. Blavatsky’s The Voice of the Silence, with Crowley’s commentary.As he wrote about this important book:The Voice of the Silence is the only Theosophical publication of the slightestliterary distinction or even of occult merit. This new edition is far morevaluable to students than any previously published because the meaning of thetreatise is for the first time made plain by the commentary of Frater O.M. NoTheosophist can afford to miss buying a copy.101[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts101]Crowley hoped—in vain—to issue a sixty-cent version through E. P. Dutton.The issue also contained two color plates: one was a portrait of Crowley in hisrobes, painted by Leon Engers Kennedy. The New York Times Book Review describedit as follows:It [The Equinox] starts with a portrait of the most occult of all the occult,the innermost of all the Inwards, the Master Therion, otherwise known as To MegaTherion, which is to say The Big Brute.… The Big Brute is not very formidablelooking: he sits half way in and half way out of a scarlet kimono before a blazeof yellow light, contemplating something firmly clutched between thumb andfinger which seems most plausibly to be a hair from a head fast growing bald.102[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts102][images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_063_r1.jpg]Portrait of Aleister Crowley by Leon Engers Kennedy from The Equinox III(1).(photo credit 13.8) [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c13-fig008a]The other was Crowley’s “May Morn.” Contrary to the sanitized description thatthe artist had offered at his exhibit, The Equinox described it thus:The picture is symbolical of the New Æon. From the blasted stump of dogma, thepoison oak of ‘original sin,’ is hanged the hag with dyed and bloody hair,Christianity.… The satyr [is] a portrait of Frater D.D.S., one of the Teachersof The Master Therion.… The Shepherd and the Nymph in the background representthe spontaneous outburst of the music of sound and motion caused by the releaseof the Children of the New Æon from the curse of the dogma of Original Sin, andother priestly bogies.After reading this description, the members of the Liberal Club were horrified,excitedly contemplating the appropriate response. Although one piped in, “Burnthem,” cooler heads prevailed. They stripped Crowley’s paintings from the wallsand phoned him with instructions to retrieve his pictures immediately.Optimism ran high on the heels of the book’s release. Ryerson reported that“Brentano’s in New York gave The Equinox a very nice display and they sent ussome money for the sale of it afterwards.”103[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts103] Jones also celebrated thebook’s release by dining with eleven others at the Fellow Crafter’s Club.104[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts104] After psychical researcherHereward Carrington (1880–1958) called the first volume of The Equinox “averitable mine of occult lore, and real knowledge” in an article on “What Is theBest ‘Psychical’ Literature?” Crowley presented a copy of the new issue to theAmerican Society for Psychical Research.105[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts105]Crowley, in fact, got to know Carrington when he first arrived in America. AsCarrington recounts,It was soon after World War I started that I received a visit from the mostremarkable man I have ever known.… My visitor brought with him a letter ofintroduction from the Hon. Everard Feilding, then Secretary of the Society forPsychical Research. It read:This will inroduce to you Aleister Crowley, poet, sage, mountain climber andgeneral lunatic. I am sure you will have much in common.106[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts106]They indeed had much in common: both Feilding and Carrington had tested Italianspiritualist medium Eusapia Palladino, and Crowley—based on Feilding’sreport—had had a sitting with her when he and Mary Desti were in Naples. Crowleywas furthermore interested in Carrington’s scientific approach to psychicscience, noting he “boasts that he has explained every single ‘sealed letterreading’ that has come under his notice.”107[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts107] Through Carrington, Crowleylectured under the auspices of “a particularly transparent charlatan named[Christian P.] Christensen, who worked the sealed letter swindle with a cruditythat paid a very poor compliment to his audience”;108[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts108] significantly, this was thelecture at which he met Leah Hirsig’s sister. Finally, Carrington saw Crowley tothe port when he left America:I saw Crowley off on the boat when he sailed. He had not been a “success” inthis country, as he had in Europe, and, while expressing my regret at this, Ialso reminded him that this was largely his own fault. His parting words—hislast shot as he went down the gang-plank—were “Well, what can you expect of acountry which accepts Ella Wheeler Wilcox as its greatest poet!”109[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts109]Around this time, Jones met with Lodge at the house of Dr. Frank E. Bowman(1873–1947), another of the prospective Detroit Thelemic circle who had takenhis Craft degrees a dozen years earlier at Oriental Lodge No. 240.110[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts110] A Canadian-born naturalizedcitizen, he was a physician and surgeon with offices on Kenilworth inDetroit.111 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts111] Of him, Crowleywrote:The best of the crowd was a young doctor who had sufficient sense to see howstupid the rest were, to disdain the bluff of the advertising adepts, and torealize that genuine magicians were necessarily gentlemen and scholars. He felthimself utterly lost in the darkness of Detroit, but despaired of mending thematter by setting forth to seek the Graal without guidance.… Pluck would havepulled him through in the long run; as Blake said, “if the fool would persist inhis folly he would become wise.”112[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts112]Anxious to proceed with establishing a Supreme Grand Council for the LakeSection of the United States, as well as the Great Lakes Council VII° of OTO,Lodge and Bowman paid Crowley’s $100 fare to Detroit. To prepare, Crowley sentrevised initiation rituals to Jones, who in turn instructed Lodge that “aMeeting of the Grand Council be called at an early date to discuss the detailsof the establishment of an Oasis in this City of Detroit and arrange for theproduction of this Degree as soon as possible.” 113[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts113]After Crowley’s arrival, according to Ryerson, “a Supreme Grand Council gottogether at the D[etroit] A[thletic] C[lub], and I think then it was formed,tentatively, if the ritual be re-written and if drafted and accepted.” Thismeeting took place on April 13, 1919. Of these negotiations, Crowley laterreflected, “Even their compact group was torn by bitter jealousies.”114[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts114] Neither Ryerson nor Hill wereinvited, causing considerable rancor. As Ryerson noted,This is what started the rupture between Dr. Hill and Mr. Crowley.… Because ofthe book store’s officers [not] being a part of it, Dr. Hill took greatexception and thought that inasmuch as we were going to market the literature ofthe Order, someone of us ought to be represented, and he made some very tersecomments about it and Crowley in the store here. And the result of it all wasthat Dr. Hill said, “Well, we won’t handle your books” and he then tried tocancel the order, and made a mess of it generally, and that started the fussbetween them.115 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts115]Hill would ultimately resign in January 1920 as president of Universal BookStores and burn his copy of The Equinox.116[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts116]During this visit, Crowley also affiliated eight Detroit Masons to OTO.“Affiliation” indicated that no initiation was performed, but the members wereformally accorded a rank in OTO commensurate with their degree in Freemasonry.In addition to Lodge, Ryerson, and Bowman, the other men signing on at this timeincluded Dr. C. P. Sibley, C. Y. Smith, W. H. Bogrand, George Jarvis, and AlbertA. Stibbard.117 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts117] U.S. DistrictAttorney Frank Murphy would later comment, “They are big men. The mention oftheir names would immediately bring on a scandal.”118[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts118]Dr. Cedric Putnam Sibley (b. 1886)119[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts119] was the second of fivechildren born in Bennington, Vermont, to Edward L. Sibley and Delia A. Putnam. Asurgeon in Cleveland, Ohio, who moved to a private practice in Detroit’s KresgeBuilding until he left for Vienna in June 1914—the same month that ArchdukeFranz Ferdinand’s assassination triggered the start of the Great War—on amission to help Austria’s wounded.120[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts120] He currently worked forParke-Davis Pharmaceuticals, whose facility on the Detroit River Crowley hadvisited:Parke Davis were charming and showed me over their wonderful chemical works.They had installed countless and ingenious devices for conduction the processesinvolved in manufacture by machinery. Many of these produced effects ofexquisite beauty of a land till then dreamed of in my philosophy. A great massof pills in a highly polished and rapidly revolving receiver was infinitelyfascinating to watch. The spheres tumbled over each other with a rhythmical riseand fall in a rhythm which sang to the soul.They were kind enough to interest themselves in my researches in AnhaloniumLewinii and made me some special preparations on the lines indicated by myexperience which proved greatly superior to previous preparations.121[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts121]If Sibley prepared the peyote, Crowley did not recall him kindly:Their second string was a doctor, who spent sleepless nights sweating with shameand sentimentality in an agony of anxiety as to whether it was his duty to getdivorced in order to marry a white-haired spinster, half-crazy with the pain ofcancer, with whom he had no sexual relation at all, but an overwhelmingobsession that she was his sister-soul, his mystic mate, his psychic partner andhis Ouija Wife.122 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts122]Insurance salesman Charles Yale Smith was born in Algonac, Michigan, in 1862 toThomas and Rowena Smith. His mother was descended from Yale University founderElihu Yale, whence Smith’s middle name. Schooled in Alpena, Michigan, he marriedEugenia Wilson of Detroit in 1901 and settled on a career in insurance, in whosecircles he became well known. He was also a prominent Mason, with memberships inDamascus Commandery of the Knights Templar (York Rite), the Michigan SovereignConsistory (Scottish Rite), and the Moslem Temple of the Mystic Shrine.123[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts123]William Henry Bogrand (1873–1949) was born in Munsing, Michigan, to EliasBogrand and Harriet Harris. At age nineteen, he married Angeline Frost inneighboring Windsor, Ontario; the marriage did not last, as the 1900 censusshows him married to a woman six years his senior named Hattie. He worked as ahouse painter, and as an electrician’s helper with the Electrical ConstructionCo. on Grand River Avenue. He took his Masonic initiations at Friendship-LincolnLodge No. 417 in September and October 1903.124[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts124]Albert Alexander Stibbard was born in York, Ontario, to farmer John SheldrakeStibbard and Mary Collings in 1875, making him Crowley’s age. He was a builderwith the Reliable Construction Co., applied for U.S. citizenship in 1918, andhis wife’s name was Elisabeth.125[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts125]Finally, George Jarvis was born in Ovid, Michigan, on July 15, 1873, taking histhree Masonic Craft initiations at Ovid Lodge No. 127 in April, May, and October1909.126 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts126]As Crowley’s relationship with Leah entered rough waters that May, he cultivatedother paramours. He wrote to Helen Westley, the Snake, proposing marriage; shehad scarcely received the letter when she declined and Crowley reconsidered. Hegrew more interested in American actress Sarah Jane Wolfe (1875–1958), a St.Petersburg, Pennsylvania, native who, after ten years as a college-trainedstenographer, changed careers after an attack of neuritis in her right arm. Shemoved to Hollywood in 1910 and became an actress, playing supportingroles—mostly mothers—in more than forty early silent movies, primarily with thePioneer Picture Company, including some with Mary Pickford.127[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts127] Coincidentally, Wolfe playedin the 1917 version of Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, while Westley would go on toappear in the 1938 remake.Wolfe became interested in the occult in 1913 when she received a copy of FranzHartmann’s Magic, White and Black (1889). In 1917, she turned from her Ouijaboard to The Equinox and Book Four on the advice of Sheridan Bickers, an earlyA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]student who had relocated to California and become Crowley’s West Coastrepresentative. Achieving success in pranayama and astral visions—which includedone of the Master himself—she contacted Crowley through The International. Heresponded by putting her back in touch with Bickers; but she wrote again andbegan corresponding directly with AC about her visions.128[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts128]In June, Leah learned she was pregnant with Crowley’s child. This was happy newsto AC, as the Secret Chiefs had taken his first child and Rose his second, andneither Jeanne Foster nor Ratan Devi bore him an heir. They reconciled promptly.When Crowley interrupted a Magical Retirement on Montauk Point at the easternextremity of Long Island and returned to New York to prepare the second newissue of The Equinox, a manuscript by Frater Achad was awaiting him. Liber 31stunned him with its revelation of a major key to The Book of the Law that Joneshad discovered in the winter of 1917. His exegesis, briefly, was this: theHebrew word for God, El, numbered thrity-one, and a trinity of thirty-ones,referring to the supernal triad of the kabbalistic Tree of Life, totaledninety-three, the value of Thelema. The Book of the Law itself implied thistriad with references to “the threefold book of Law” and “Three Grades.” Eventhe numbers of the tarot cards attributed to these three grades—IX (The Hermit),VI (The Lovers), and XVI (The Tower)—added to thirty-one.The important twist came from noting that El, spelled backward, meant “not.”This notion of reversibility was paramount in religious and magical practice.When Hadit asked, “Is God to live in a dog?”129[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts129] he alluded to the principle;so too did Achad when altering his motto from V.I.O. to O.I.V.V.I.O. Assynchronicity would have it, Achad, the Hebrew word for “one,” had a numericalvalue of thirteen, which was the reverse of thirty-one. Crowley had also appliedthis idea to derive the XI° by a “reversal” of OTO’s IX° formula of sex magick,and Austin Spare used it in his practice of “atavistic resurgence.” Even the godname Allah, or AL-LA, incorporated it.In Crowley’s mind, Achad’s thesis was further proof that The Book of the Laworiginated from an intelligence possessing knowledge greater than the instrumentof its writing. Both Samuel Jacobs and Frater Achad found important keys andsolutions that Crowley failed to see. In response to Achad’s paper, Crowleychanged the official name of The Book of the Law from Liber L vel Legis to LiberAL vel Legis.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_064_r1.jpg]Frater Achad, Charles Stansfeld Jones (1886–1950). (photo credit 13.9)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c13-fig009a]The Equinox proved to be a white elephant. It did not, as claimed, find a readymarket. When a distributor in Louisville, Kentucky, reconsidered carrying it,Ryerson complained that “Norwood appears to have become concerned in the evilreports, apparently circulated by our enemies.”130[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts130] This was Joseph Norwood of theInternational Magian Society, who at this time also reported Crowley to theBureau of Investigation as a possible spy. Things worsened when Crowleythreatened to sue Universal Book Stores for payment on the rariora he had onconsignment with them. On June 16, 1919, Ryerson pleaded with Crowley, statingthat publication of The Equinox had alienated his family, friends, and businessassociates, and that a lawsuit would bankrupt his company. They reached anunderstanding, and work proceeded on the second issue, which would contain thecontinuation of “A Master of the Temple,” a reprint of the Holy Book “LiberLiberi vel Lapidis Lazuli,” “Liber XXI,” and, as a special supplement, TheGospel According to St. Bernard Shaw.131[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts131] Alas, this volume would neverget beyond page proofs.132 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts132]When September 23 came and went without a new issue, Crowley resigned himself toa delay in the next Equinox. Despite this setback, the Great Work proceeded.Thus that same day, Crowley—together with Leah and Roddie Minor, the new and oldScarlet Women—received a Double Word: Ahitha-Alostrael, the combination of bothwomen’s magical names. For Leah, this established a succession between Crowley’smagical and sexual partners. Thereafter the priest and whore, Beast and Babalon,swore to promulgate the Law of Thelema and establish somewhere an Abbey ofThelema.Both prepared to pull up stakes. On October 2, Leah resigned from New York’spublic schools; a month later, she went to stay with her ailing sister inSwitzerland. Meanwhile, that October Crowley traveled to Decatur, Georgia, tobid farewell to the Seabrooks. One evening, as he stayed on their farm, ACdecided with Willie to try a variation on the Trappist monk vow of silence. Fora week they agreed to confine their speech to a single nonsense syllable: wow.Although visitors thought them mad and Shep, the servant, was bewildered, theysoon learned the importance of intonation, speaking several rudimentary thingsin “wow.” The experiment culminated when Shep produced a gallon of moonshine;becoming very drunk, they conducted a sublime philosophical conversation in“wow,” interrupted only when Kate, who had tolerated their eccentricity,insisted in the early morning hours that they go to bed. Although Seabrookthought the experience sublime, she believed they simply got drunk and barked ateach other all night.133 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts133]During this time, Crowley wrote increasingly passionate letters to Jane Wolfe,addressing her as “Best beloved,” “My darling child,” and “Janet o’ mine.” Hebegged her to meet him in England before he joined Leah in Switzerland, but thebest she could do was promise to visit him in June.From Georgia, Crowley took a side trip to the Mammoth Caves of Kentucky, thenreturned to business. “I once went from Louisville to Detroit,” he recalled, “Ithink, on a train called the Big Four, car number four, berth number four. Itstarted at 4:44 p.m. from platform number four, and my ticket was numbered44444. Meant nothing. Why should it be otherwise?”134[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts134]In November 1919, Crowley had another meeting with several Detroit-area Masons.Things did not go smoothly. It included only four of the original chartermembers, and “a certain prominent attorney was elected its head.”135[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts135] This was undoubtedly Frank T.Lodge. In response to this tentative organization of OTO, Crowley and Jonessponsored Ryerson’s application for initiation (rather than mere affiliation)into OTO’s preliminary degree on November 24, 1919. The Detroiters rehearsed“the ritual” of OTO one night in November, but it is unclear which ritual wasrehearsed. In one place it was described as involving kneeling before apriestess,136 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts136] suggesting theGnostic Mass.Regardless, trouble brewed. According to Ryerson, there was an argument aboutwho should be the “Supreme Grand Cheese,” with the result that OTO was neverorganized, no one was initiated, and no dues were paid. Nevertheless, Crowleyentrusted The Equinox with “the bug house” in Detroit, who promised to bring outthe next issue once funds became available; Achad became his business manager inabsentia. Thus, in mid-December, Crowley left the United States, his bookbusiness in the hands of Achad and Ryerson, to chase even bigger dreams back toEngland. As he recalled, “When I returned to England at Christmas 1919, all myplans had gone to pieces owing to the dishonesty and treachery of a gang whichwas bullying into insanity my publisher in Detroit.”137[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts137] Unknown to Crowley, he hadleft a scandal brewing behind him.The summer, fall, and winter months of 1920–1921 saw a great deal of shufflingamongst the Detroit Thelemites. On April 13, 1920, W. T. Smith was fired fromhis job, so he left Vancouver and joined Jones in Detroit to help with the GreatWork. He soon found a job at the Detroit City Gas Company,138[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts138] and remained there with Jonesuntil they both moved to Chicago the following June. Russell, who had been inDetroit since May 1919, left that fall to join Crowley at the Abbey of Thelemain Sicily, arriving on November 21, 1920. Shortly after Russell left town,another Thelemite arrived in the person of Norman Mudd. He had taken asabbatical from his professorial position in South Africa’s Grey UniversityCollege to seek out Crowley, whom he hadn’t seen since his undergraduate days atCambridge. Having purchased the latest Equinox, he went to Detroit but foundonly Jones and Smith. They treated their visiting Brother well, and Jonesadmitted him as a Neophyte into theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]139[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts139] before he continued on toCefalù finally to reunite with Crowley.When, in September 1920, six tons of books arrived unexpectedly from Crowley,Jones was dumbstruck. He had to beg and borrow money to pay the substantial dutyon these books, which he then placed in storage with Detroit’s LeonardWarehouse. He sold them on the side through Universal Book Stores in an effortto recoup his money. When he moved to Chicago, he somehow lost track of thesecrates—this would become an irreconcilable bone of contention between him andCrowley—and they remained forgotten in Detroit until rediscovered in 1958. Thebulk of this collection wound up in the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Centerin Austin, Texas.Jones and Smith left Detroit on March 26, 1921, for Chicago. There, on April 2,Jones opened a post office box under the name Collegium ad Spiritum Sanctum tosell Crowley’s books and for putting out his own writing. Their decision toleave Detroit was well timed. Poor sales of The Equinox and the postponed (andultimately abandoned) second issue prompted Ryerson to write to Crowley inJanuary 1921 offering to exchange some unsold blue Equinoxes for older issues.In May 1921 the beleaguered Universal Book Stores were in bankruptcy court.Their creditors and trustees alleged that Ryerson single-handedly ruined thebusiness by misappropriating as much as $35,000 for the publication of Crowley’sbook (a falsehood, as the actual printing costs were far less). As Grover L.Morden, counsel for the creditors and trustees, put it, “A business man shouldhave known that the frontispiece of The Equinox, representing the hanging ofChristianity on a gibbet, alone would have resulted in the failure of thepublishing house.”140 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts140] AlthoughUniversal Book Stores was adjudicated bankrupt on September 6, 1921,141[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts141] a series of hearings followedconcerning these allegations.These bankruptcy proceedings drew the attention of the press, and soon the taleof Ryerson, Crowley and OTO filled the front pages of the January and February1922 newspapers in a series of exposés that Ryerson called “the mess in thepress.” The first of these articles exposed the existence of Detroit’s “lovecult,” as the papers dubbed OTO. The Equinox’s naked priestess and Christianityhanged on a gibbet shocked casual readers. Dr. James W. Inches, Detroit policecommissioner, remarked, “The sort of conduct described in The Equinox is commonin Europe, but it will not do for Detroit.”142[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts142] Federal prosecutor Paul W.Voorheis was even more vocal:I consider this book the most remarkable and most degenerate book I have everseen. I am going to stop the sale of it, and will instruct the police to seizeevery copy found in bookstores in this city. Furthermore, if a chapter of thisorganization exists in Detroit, we are going to wipe it out. The rites describedin The Equinox calls for a sort of conduct we are not going to tolerate inDetroit, if we can prevent it.143[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts143]U.S. District Attorney Frank Murphy concurred, calling The Equinox “the mostlascivious and libidinous book that has ever been published in the UnitedStates”144 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts144] and “the mostindecent and obscene book I ever have seen.”145[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts145] A divorcée soon recounted toMurphy under conditions of anonymity how The Equinox ruined her marriage:As a result of my husband’s studying this book, my home is wrecked and I amforced to face the world alone and make my own living. Before this book wasgiven to my husband, he was a good man, true, devoted and industrious. Nightafter night he studied this book. He wanted me to read it, but I soon saw thatit was not fit even for beasts. I pleaded with him to give it up, but he refusedto do so. Finally he began to go to meetings. He said the book gave him theright to go where he pleased, to do what he pleased and to love whom he pleased.As a result of my experiences, my health is so broken that, while I want tostamp out this book, my physician tells me that if I go into court that I willdie, as my heart has been affected.146[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts146]In mere days, the news coverage snowballed from uncovering the existence of asecret society in the city of Detroit. On January 12, 1922, Voorheis received asearch and seizure warrant, sealing all books in the basement storage facilityof Universal Book Stores until they were either turned over to creditors ordestroyed. Furthermore, Voorheis pointed out than anyone “publishing, causing tobe published, printing, selling, exposing for sale, distributing, exhibiting oreven having in his possession any book found to be hurtful to the publicmorals”147 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts147] was subject to a$1,000 fine.Four private investigators claimed they had been bribed to keep quiet, and “aprominent Detroit attorney” (presumably the same one who had earlier suppliedMurphy with details regarding OTO’s activities) found $700 on his desk with anote asking him to shut up. Upon inventorying the book stock, an even moretroubling finding emerged: of 2,000 copies of The Equinox printed, only 1,100became the property of Universal Book Stores. The whereabouts of the 900 othercopies then became a concern.When bankruptcy lawyer Morden showed Voorheis mail order records for TheEquinox, the stakes got even higher. If the book was obscene, then sending orreceiving it by mail was a federal offense. Postal inspector E. E. Fraser wasbrought in to determine whether postal laws had been violated, with Voorheispromising, if so, to convene a grand jury to subpoena and prosecute every singleperson who either produced or purchased the book.The yellow press believed the answer came with the murder of motion picturedirector William Desmond Taylor (1872–1922). Investigators of thisstill-unsolved homicide discovered love letters from nineteen-year-old actressMary Miles Minter (1902–1984) in Taylor’s copy of White Stains. Furthermore,actresses Mabel Normand (1892–1930), questioned by police as the last person tosee Taylor alive, admitted she was a recipient of The Equinox. Indeed, copies ofThe Equinox had circulated among many Hollywood luminaries (thanks, no doubt, toCrowley’s Hollywood connections Sheridan Bickers and Jane Wolfe). This droveGrover Morden to wild conjecture:It is possible that the order has obtained a foothold in the picture colony andcolor is lent this theory by the frequent occurrence of alleged drug orgiesamong the movie stars.… Some drug crazed maniac or jealous woman of the O.T.O.may have been Taylor’s mysterious assailant.… There are nearly 900 copies [ofThe Equinox] unaccounted for and there is every reason to believe that the mostof these reached the Pacific coast.148[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts148]Credence was lent to this theory by the back inside cover of The Equinox. Justas the previous issue contained “Dead Waite,” Crowley’s premature obituary ofoccult author A. E. Waite, the latest issue contained yet another love note fromCrowley to Waite. Titled “Arthur Back From Avalon,” it described Waite’s latestpurported exploits by reproducing newspaper headlines about Grand Rapids,Michigan, dentist and murderer coincidentally named Arthur Waite:Waite Confesses; Gave Poison that Killed Millionaire Peck.Waite Confesses to Two Murders.Waite Grins in Telling How He Killed Victims.To Michiganders for whom the Grand Rapids Waite was far more familiar, Crowley’ssend-up of the British writer was mistaken as sympathizing with the killer andadvocating murder.Because Ryerson, as the manager of the Universal Book Stores, was the only namethe press could attach to the scandal, he was cast as the love cult’sringleader. As Crowley recounted,In Detroit, months after my return to Europe, they repeatedly raided poorhalf-crazed Ryerson’s house in search of some evidence of the “DevilWorshipper’s Mystic Love Cult” and of course found nothing; from which theyconcluded not my innocence, but that my pact with the devil contained a clauseguaranteeing me against the discovery of my crimes. If any of those obstinateasses had possessed sufficient intelligence to study a single page of mywritings, he would have seen at once what ridiculous rubbish were theaccusations made against me by foul-minded and illiterate cheats whom I hadnever so much as met.149 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts149]The other members of the Great Lakes Council were understandably nervous aboutbeing subjected to the same treatment and having their names dragged through themud. Thus a deal was worked out between Universal Book Stores’ main stockholder:he would not sue (and, as a Mason, was forbidden from doing so anyway) providedRyerson would not name any of the other members. He agreed, and in the end,bankruptcy referee George A. Marston ruled the questioning out of order.At the end of 1922, Ryerson’s name again filled headlines in a divorce case thatserved as a final cautionary tale regarding Detroit’s love cult. Having partedfrom Bertha Bruce (they had filled out a marriage license but never filed itwith the city), Ryerson, at age forty, wed eighteen-year-old model MazieMitchell on a thirty-day trial basis. When she sued for divorce twenty-nine daysafter their wedding, Ryerson’s role in the scandal—and his ongoing interest inthe ancients’ worship of sex—returned to the headlines. She accused him ofbeating her. He accused her of being previously married.Ryerson’s last public statement about the OTO controversy in which he becameembroiled is both succinct and tragic:I was not a part of the official organization nor never was invited, neither wasI its head.… When trouble came and unsavory notoriety, I was made the “goat”.… Ihave in my silence practically laid down my life for my friends, who have notshown any disposition to help me in this awful trouble, allowing me to stand thebrunt of it all alone when they know I am entirely innocent of any complicity inthe matter.My home has been completely ransacked at various intervals, my papers and booksseized, my servants bribed, my library robbed, and I have been persecuted beyondendurance by people seeking evidence concerning the O.T.O. which has been inerror dubbed a love cult and which never had any active existence in Detroit.150[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts150]He then moved to Georgia, remarried, and disappeared from public life until his1931 death in Florida.151 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts151] Thedrama in Detroit, however, was a prelude to an unprecedented “mess in the press”that would soon confront Crowley.When James Branch Cabell expanded his short tale “Some Ladies and Jurgen” intothe critically acclaimed libertine fantasy Jurgen—the most ambitious prose sagasince Byron’s Don Juan—Crowley and the blue Equinox became the center of anotherAmerican scandal. After the book went through three printings, the public begancrying out against the phallic symbolism of the hero’s lance, staff, and sword.Outrage swelled until January 14, 1920, when John Sumner of the New York Societyfor the Suppression of Vice marched into Robert M. McBride and Co., seized theplates and all copies of Jurgen, and presented book department manager Guy Holtwith a summons on charges of violating Section 1141 of New York’s penal code.Much of the controversy, it turned out, involved Chapter XXII, “As to a Veil HeBroke,” which Cabell based upon the Gnostic Mass. In this part of the book,Jurgen travels to the land of Cocaigne, whose pagan philosophy was “Do thatwhich seems good to you.” Here, Jurgen encounters Queen Anaitis and conductswhat is essentially a Gnostic Mass:Then Jurgen raised Queen Anaitis so that she sat upon the altar, and that whichwas there before tumbled to the ground. Anaitis placed together the tips of herthumbs and other fingers, so that her hands made an open triangle.…Then Anaitis said: “Yea, for I speak with the tongue of every woman, and I shinein the eyes of every woman, when the lance is lifted. To serve me is better thanall else. When you invoke me with a heart wherein is kindled the serpent flame,if but for a moment, you will understand the delights of my garden, what joyunwordable pulsates therein, and how potent is the sole desire which uses all ofa man. To serve me you will then be eager to surrender whatever else is in yourlife: and other pleasures you will take with your left hand, not thinking ofthem entirely: for I am the desire which uses all of a man, and so wastesnothing. And I accept you, I yearn toward you, I who am daughter and somewhatmore than daughter to the Sun. I who am all pleasure, all ruin, and adrunkenness of the inmost sense, desire you.”Now Jurgen held his lance erect before Anaitis.…152[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts152]Crowley, duly flattered, called Cabell’s work “the best book that has yet tocome out of U.S.A.” and “an incomparable splendour, a star of the firstmagnitude blazing in the firmament.”153[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c13-nts153] Cabell stood trial on October16, 1922. Although John Quinn believed the case hopeless, Cabell successfullyargued that the lance ceremony in his book had a real model, one that wasalready in print in the blue Equinox. Cabell was acquitted on October 19, andthe resulting popularity transformed him into a literary giant."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURTEENTHE ABBEY OF THELEMACrowley returned to his war-ravaged homeland just before Christmas, findingmerrie olde England much like he remembered it: cold, damp and dreary. It wasonly the first misery he would find awaiting him. Having no place to live, hestayed with his aunt at the same Eton Lodge abode that he, in The Fatherland,had challenged Count Zeppelin to level. As he wrote at the time, “Not only hasthe war changed nothing in this house of my aunt’s where I have roosted, butthey haven’t altered the position of a piece of furniture since Queen Victoriacame to the throne.”1 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts001]When the weather flared his chronic bronchitis into asthma, Crowley turned tohis physician since 1898, Harold Batty Shaw (1866–1936), a specialist inconsumption and chest diseases. A man of abnormal energy and strong opinions,Shaw was educated at Yorkshire College, Leeds, and University College, London.He gave the 1896 Goulstonian Lectures before the Royal College of Physicians ayear before earning his MD degree and two years before joining the RoyalCollege’s ranks. His students at University College and Brompton Hospital founda dogmatic and precise teacher in him. His most famous patient was arguablyIndian mathematical genius Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887–1920).2[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts002] For Crowley, Shaw prescribed acommon analgesic: heroin.3 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts003]Despite his physician’s credentials, Crowley became dependent on what was then alegal if not efficacious drug. Alas, passage of the British Dangerous Drug Actin 1921 would leave Crowley in a predicament, as will be seen later.For now, he was destitute. The money and possessions he had put into storagebefore the war had vanished: doubtlessly, he believed, at the hands of Cowie andWaddell. Although Crowley inherited £3,000 on his mother’s death, the provisionsof his divorce settlement earmarked the money for a trust fund to be splitbetween himself and his daughter, Lola Zaza.When Crowley checked to see how his old friend Oscar Eckenstein had fared sincethe war had interrupted their planned attempt on Kangchenjunga, he found him astodgy married man, and never saw him again. While AC’s disappointment is thinlyveiled, the inescapable truth is that Eckenstein was sixty-one years old at thispoint, to Crowley’s forty-four. Furthermore, in the years since their 1902expedition, Eckenstein had remained far more active in the sport than Crowley:he continued climbing until at least 1912, when he was fifty-three. In 1908 heredesigned the crampon into the prototype from which modern designs derive; heinvented an innovative short ice-ax; and he published technical articles onknot-tying and on the use of nails on climbing boots.4[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts004] Eckenstein died of consumptionshortly thereafter in 1921.The final straw was the yellow press rolling out the welcome mat in itsinimitable style. John Bull greeted Crowley with the headline:Another Traitor TrouncedCareer and Condemnation of the Notorious Aleister CrowleyThe article read, “We await an assurance from the Home Office or the ForeignOffice that steps are being taken to arrest the renegade or to prevent hisinfamous feet ever again polluting our shores.”5[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts005] Although the attack upsetCrowley, he followed the I Ching’s advice to do nothing. Fortunately, CommodoreGaunt interceded to advise authorities against taking action. Thus, while publicopinion of Crowley remained low, nothing came of the outcry.Knowing there had to be something better than this, feeling himself caught up ina new magical current, he wired Leah to meet him in Paris. She arrived eightmonths pregnant and with Hansi in tow. On January 11, a year after Leah firstbecame the Scarlet Woman, they swore to build an Abbey of Thelema.At this time, Leah described to AC how, on the boat from America, she befriendeda French woman, Augustine Louise Hélène Fraux Shumway, nicknamed Ninette(1894–1990). Born in Decazeville, France, on June 9, 1894, she had lived in theUnited States since 1911, marrying American Howard C. Shumway in 1915, who diedin an automobile accident before their son, Howard, was born in Boston on July17, 1916. Ninette found work as a nursery governess, but with no family to helpsupport her, she decided to leave Concord, Massachuestts, and return to herhomeland, where she could leave Howard in the care of her parents, get agoverness job, and possibly help with the reconstruction of France.6[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts006] Crowley could practically readLeah’s mind and agreed that they would need a governess for their new child.Besides, Howard would be an ideal playmate for Hansi. Recognizing another kismetin the Great Work, he arranged to meet Mrs. Shumway in Paris and offer her aposition.A pallid, wilted woman of twenty-five, she stood five feet, two inches tall withgray eyes and brown hair, listlessly holding her child’s hand. Ninette Shumwayreminded him of Ratan Devi. The boy was as white and lifeless as her, clingingtightly to his mother and crying incessantly. “They gave me the shock of mylife,” Crowley recalled.7 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts007]Offered a job, Ninette, in well-spoken but imperfect English, accepted. Shereturned with Crowley to Fontainebleau, where they and Leah stayed in a rentedhouse at 11-bis rue de Neuville. Here, Crowley pondered potential locations forhis Abbey of Thelema.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_065_r1.jpg]Ninette Shumway (1894–1990) and her son, Howard. (photo credit 14.1)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c14-fig001a]On January 30, Crowley called on his old mistress, Jane Chéron, hoping to makelove, smoke opium, and catch up with Walter Duranty. He struck out on all threecounts: Duranty was still on assignment in Russia for the New York Times, andChéron was disinclined to both sex and drugs. However, when Crowley prepared toleave empty-handed, Jane insisted, “Shut your eyes!” Then she unfurled a pieceof cloth and told him he could look.His stunned eyes beheld a four-foot silk appliqué reproduction of the Stele ofRevealing. She explained that in February 1917 she and her “young man”—almostcertainly Duranty—searched the south of France for a cure for opium addiction.Suffering from insomnia, she awoke one day after dozing off to realize she haddrawn, in her sleep, a reproduction of the Stele. This so impressed her that shespent the next three months reproducing it in silk. Such a labor from a womanuninterested in magick also impressed Crowley. That this encounter should comeat such a crucial time in his life was, to Crowley, an unmistakable sign that hewas on the right course with this Abbey business.AC’s priapic tendencies did not end with Chéron. He continued writing passionateletters to the distant and faceless Jane Wolfe: “Now I see you before me shiningin the dark—I turn out the lights for a little—I hold you closely—our lightkindles—.”8 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts008] Impatient for herto visit, he arranged a meeting in Bou-Sâada on June 25, the place and date ofhis Magister Templi initiation.Eventually, however, his desires found a more practical object: Ninette Shumway.It began innocently enough, the two taking long walks in the country while Leahconvalesced. Crowley soon dubbed her “Beauty,” and Shummy, as she was otherwiseknown, found him increasingly attractive. Then, one afternoon after lunch at theBarbison, Beauty and the Beast walked in the Fontainebleau forest. The vernalweather made them feel young, the wine made them giddy, and the danger made herirresistible. They chased each other through the glade and finally fell intoeach other’s arms with a passionate clasp. Crowley and Shummy soon began doingsex magick to locate a suitable Abbey.Curiously enough, Leah did not object. She knew that, as the Scarlet Woman, shewas number one in Crowley’s book. Furthermore, she understood the promiscuousinterpretation of “Love under will” and found it was one Crowley encouragedwithout double standards. Ninette, however, brooded jealously and insecurelyabout sharing her man.At 5 o’clock on the morning of Thursday, January 26, Leah’s water broke. Shewent to the hospital in Fontainebleau and, after an easy labor, gave birth to adaughter at 12:05 that afternoon. She looked like her mother except for themouth, which was unmistakably Crowley’s. On March 8, Leah returned home from thehospital.Ever the magician, AC named the baby Anne Lea—after the goddess of summer andthe Scarlet Woman, respectively—thus giving her the monogram AL, the Hebrew nameof God and the key to The Book of the Law. However, when little Howard declaredduring a walk in the forest, “I shall call her Poupée,” the name (French for“doll”) was so spontaneous and appropriate that they unanimously adopted it asher nickname.Shortly after Poupée’s birth, Ninette herself became pregnant.Although the I Ching directed them to locate the Abbey in Cefalù, Italy, theylacked the money to do so. Thus, on March 21, Crowley took Leah and Poupée toLondon, where Leah stayed with AC’s aunt and arranged finances with his lawyer;evidently, Crowley had £700 coming in another inheritance. He then fetchedShummy and “the brats” from France and proceeded toward Cefalù. He thought it agood omen that his train seat was number 31, a key value in The Book of the Law.The money arrived for them in Naples on March 30, allowing them to continue totheir destination.Cefalù was a small seaport with only one main street, located northwest ofSicily and thirty-seven miles from Palermo. In ancient times, when known asCephaloedium, it allied with Carthage in 396 BC and was taken by the Moors in858 AD. More recently, it was known for its marble quarries and the cathedralbuilt by the great Norman hero Count Roger. Here, one night in a dingy hotelchanged their lives. When Crowley swore not to stay another day in suchdespicable lodgings, Giordana Giosus overheard and told them he had a villa forrent. Crowley, again seeing fate’s hand, agreed to view the place.A sinuous path just beyond town wound up the mountainside to aneighteenth-century villa known as the Villa Santa Barbara. Located south of therock of Cephaloedium and just beyond a Capuchin monastery, it faced the sea amida field of grass, trees, and a garden. It was a single-story stone structure,encased in plaster and painted all white except for the red-tiled floor. Fiverooms and a shelf-lined pantry flanked its large central room, which Crowleyimmediately saw as a temple.9 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts009]Crowley assessed the place rapidly. Despite a complete lack of plumbing, gas,and electricity, it had everything he needed: a temple, access to water, androcks to climb. The size was ample. And near the building, Crowley noted twoPersian nut trees; just as they were a sign for the Villa Caldarazzo in 1911, soin Crowley’s mind were they good omens for Cefalù. He struck a deal on the spotto rent the Villa Santa Barbara as the Abbey of Thelema.They moved in immediately and that evening blessed the grounds with an act ofsex magick. “Salutation to the Gods and Goddesses of this place! May they grantus abundance of all good things, and inspire me to the creation of beauty,”10[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts010] he wrote in his journal. Andso the Inglesi, Sigñor Caroli, began to prepare the Abbey of Thelema. He dubbedthe main building the “Whore’s Cell,” and turned the main room into a temple: hepainted a circle on the floor and placed in its center an altar, a copy of thestele, The Book of the Law, numerous candles, and other implements. The Throneof the Beast sat in the east, facing the altar in the center of the room. TheScarlet Woman’s throne sat across from this, in the west. Statues of variousgods were placed around the room. The temple, according to Crowley’s design,would be open to all students at the Abbey.The children soon quit sniveling and became active, healthy boys, Hansi takingto swimming and Howie to chess. Crowley would approach the boys in the morningand point to the sky. “Up there is the sun. When it gets over there, you maycome back.” Thus he sent them off to play, and they would invariably return withfruits stolen from local farms or Sicilian bread given to them by the farmers.Equally often, one or both lost their clothes. And they were always full ofstories of the day’s adventures.For Crowley, this was paradise.The question “Why Cefalù?” naturally arises, and the answer lies in a confluenceof several influences. One was the migration to Italy of the literati headmired. Much as he was an individualist, Crowley nevertheless emulated those heesteemed, and validated himself by comparison to them. Thus he modeled not onlyhis poetic style but even the byline of Aceldama (1898) after Shelley; when heleft Cambridge without a degree, he followed the footsteps of Byron, Shelley,Swinburne, and Tennyson; after introductions by Gerald Kelly, he became afixture at Le Chat Blanc in Paris; and he followed Allan Bennett and OscarEckenstein to India. Years later, when commenting on being expelled from Italy,Crowley would remark tellingly, “Like Mr. H. G. Wells and many otherdistinguished Englishmen, my presence was not desired by Mussolini.”11[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts011]Another impetus stemmed from his newfound love of art and the model presented bypostimpressionist painter Paul Gauguin (1848–1903). Gauguin was a successfulstockbroker whose pursuit of painting led him to abandon his career, wife, andchildren. In 1891, at age forty-three, he moved to Tahiti and married a nativegirl. He moved into a cottage that he called the “House of Carnal Pleasure” andfilled it with his paintings. Similarly, Crowley, having himself squandered hisfortune and divorced his wife, had, at age forty-four, moved to a remote villahe dubbed the “Whore’s Cell” to pursue art. The influence of Gauguin isunmistakable; Crowley paid the painter a high honor by adding his name to thelist of saints in his Gnostic Mass in 1921. The versions published in TheInternational (1918) and the blue Equinox (1919) do not contain his name,although subsequent editions do. Clearly, Crowley regarded Gauguin as a kindredspirit.Crowley’s works are relatively silent on the topic of Paul Gauguin; so whatprompted this interest in the painter nearly twenty years after his death?Crowley did not say, although one possibility exists in W. Somerset Maugham’sfictionalization of Gauguin’s life, The Moon and Sixpence (1919), which had justcome out. It is easy to imagine Crowley identifying with protagonist CharlesStrickland, a man whose single-minded devotion to art ruined his finances andfamily and even drove his wife to suicide. Strickland’s comment,“I don’t want love.… I am a man, and sometimes I want a woman. When I’vesatisfied my passion I’m ready for other things. I can’t overcome my desire, butI hate it; it imprisons my spirit; I look forward to the time when I shall befree from all desire and can give myself without hindrance to my work.”12[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts012]is echoed epigrammatically by Crowley: “The stupidity of having had to wasteuncounted priceless hours in chasing what ought to have been brought to the backdoor every evening with the milk!”13[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts013] Crowley and Strickland evenshared a passion for chess. Maugham’s description of the artist’s mural-coveredwalls in Tahiti is especially evocative:From floor to ceiling the walls were covered with a strange and elaboratecomposition. It was indescribably wonderful and mysterious. It took his breathaway. It filled him with an emotion which he could not understand or analyse. Hefelt the awe and the delight which a man might feel who watched the beginning ofa world. It was tremendous, sensual, passionate; and yet there was somethinghorrible there, too, something which made him afraid. It was the work of a manwho had delved into the hidden depths of nature and had discovered secrets whichwere beautiful and fearful too. It was the work of a man who knew things whichit is unholy for men to know. There was something primeval there and terrible.It was not human. It brought to his mind vague recollections of black magic. Itwas beautiful and obscene.14 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts014]As will be seen, this idea would greatly influence Crowley.While there is no evidence that Crowley actually read The Moon and Sixpence,Maugham’s book fits chronologically. There’s also an appealing justice to thinkthat the author who modeled Oliver Haddo after Crowley later influenced Crowleyto model himself after another of his characters: art imitating life, and lifeimitating art.On April 14, Leah and Poupée arrived at the Abbey to complete the family. Sheand Crowley signed the lease to the villa as Sir Alastor de Kerval and ContessaLéa Harcourt. In this spiritual haven, they donned new names: Crowley becameBeast; Leah was Alostrael, Virgin Guardian of the Sangraal; Ninette was Cypris;Howie and Hansi became Hermes and Dionysus. And Poupée, who arrived ill fromEngland, drank goat’s milk, which nourished Jupiter.They quickly developed a schedule for work at the Abbey: every morning, Leahwould rise, strike a gong, and proclaim the Law of Thelema. Everyone present,even the children, would respond with “Love is the law, love under will.”Everyone would follow with the solar salutations of “Liber Resh” (to bepracticed morning, noon, sunset, and midnight). Sitting down to a breakfastprepared by Ninette, they would “Say Will,” which was Crowley’s answer to grace.He would begin meals by rapping on the table to call all to attention. “Do whatthou wilt shall be the whole of the Law,” the diners would say. Crowley, inresponse, would ask, “What is thy will?”“It is my will to eat and drink,” came the reply.“To what end?”“That my body may be fortified thereby,” came the reply.“To what end?” he pressed on.“That I may accomplish the Great Work.”With that, Crowley would declare, “Love is the law, love under will.” Thisritual—or some variation thereon—began the meal. They would then eat incontemplative silence. These progressive questions betrayed his father’sinfluence, recalling Edward “Get-Right-with-God” Crowley’s repeated use of thequestion “And then what?” to lead up to his own trademark statement.Aside from these regimented tasks, the rules permitted individual work andstudy. Climbing, swimming, studying, and writing filled most days; Ninette,after finishing her housework, took long walks. And in keeping with hisphilosophy, Beast bought drugs from a Palermo pusher named Amatore and made themavailable to all residents of the Abbey; his goal was not to encourage drugs,but to make them so readily accessible that he removed all temptation.With routine at the Abbey established, all that remained was to send invitationsto his students.Leah’s arrival on April 14 left Ninette intensely bitter and jealous. In herexperience, Leah had always been a convalescing and nonthreatening other woman,and even though she knew better, Ninette felt on top of the situation. Sheenjoyed having Beast all to herself while Leah was in England, but now themaster bedroom belonged to Leah. The Virgin Guardian of the Sangraal commandedBeast’s attention and affection, and Ninette felt rejected.On April 20, less than a week after Leah’s arrival, their ménage à trois slippedinto an emotional morass. That night, all three got intoxicated and aroused;Beast, following an intense sexual performance, jokingly remarked, “You girlswould wear out any man’s tool, were it steel or stone. Would God that you wereLesbians and I could sleep alone!” Leah, taking the jibe goodheartedly, mademock overtures toward Ninette, who grabbed a thin cloak to cover her nakednessand dashed into the rain. Crowley cursed and pursued her, fearing what mischiefshe might discover in her recklessness. Meanwhile Leah fumed, seeing throughShummy’s attention-getting ploy and knocking back some more liquor. Eventuallyshe persuaded Howard to call for his mother.An hour of searching finally uncovered Beauty, whom Beast convinced to returnhome. Ushering her into the Whore’s Cell—past Leah, who cursed drunkenly ather—and into bed, Beast emerged to find Leah vomiting. He soothed her next.Finally, he produced his manuscript of the Tao Teh King and recited from it toreturn their minds to a higher plane. As he read, he smirked inwardly. “Nextplease! Let’s all live up to ‘Never dull where Crowley is.’ ”15[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts015]The following day, Poupée’s health worsened visibly. Unable to absorb food, shewas literally wasting away. This was precisely the augury which the I Ching hadgiven for Poupée’s birth: Hexagram XLI, Diminution. Beast consulted herprogressed astrological chart and found Saturn and the sun both opposing Mars:this was bad, and he feared she might not live through the week. “I have beenhowling like a mad creature nearly all day,” he recorded in his journal. “I wantmy epitaph to be, ‘Half a woman made with half a god.’ ”16[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts016]To take his mind off his troubles, Beast immersed himself in writing andpainting. If he was lucky, he slept at odd times, but in the main he sufferedchronic insomnia. And, even though Poupée survived the next week withoutincident, Crowley’s symptoms continued. This was because the insomnia was notdue to stress but to his continuing abuse of heroin and cocaine.Crowley soon found himself with two expectant “wives” when Leah became pregnantagain that May.On June 21, Leah was with Beast on a train to meet Jane Wolfe. However, he lefther in Palermo and continued alone to his rendezvous in Tunis. Beast had becomeobsessed with the mystery of Jane Wolfe. Having reconsidered summoning Jane to asummer clime as inhospitable as Bou-Sâada’s, he had wired her to meet him inTunis instead. “I adore her name,” he anticipated her arrival. “I hope she ishungry and cruel as a wolf.” In his diary, he wrote,I am hers.… I die that She may live.… I drown in delight at the thought that Iwho have been Master of the Universe should lie beneath Her feet, Her slave, Hervictim, eager to be abased.17 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts017]His health failed in Tunis, and he recorded in his diary, “A most unpleasant dayof severe illness. I think I may have been poisoned by reading Conan Doyle.”18[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts018] More likely, his illnessstemmed from the same sanitary conditions at Cefalù that had given Leahdysentery a month earlier.When the appointed day came and went without Jane Wolfe’s arrival, Crowleyfilled himself with cocaine and wrote “Leah Sublime,” a poem dedicated to hisScarlet Woman. While not as subtle or artistic as the poems he wrote for Rose,it certainly holds a unique place in Crowley’s corpus, collecting all his filthinto one poem. Its most memorable (and polite) lines were:Stab your demonicalSmile to my brain!Soak me in cognacCunt and cocaine …19 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts019]By July 3, Crowley impatiently scribbled in his diary, “I shall certainly notwait for more than two weeks for her, one only has to wait three for Syphilisherself.” After a few more fruitless days, he gave up. Crowley returned toCefalù on July 10.At this time, Crowley was undergoing what Norman Mudd would later describe asthe “mystery of filth,” and Leah happily indulged his wishes. Thus, on July 22,Crowley experimented with masochism in a bedroom game wherein Leah became adominant, menacing tyrant, exclaiming at Crowley:So low art thou—crawl to my floor-blackened feet, and call them snow-puremarble.… You dog! to your slaves’ task! to your mock Love, you dog! You dirtydog! Do it, you dirty dog! To my soiled feet, lap them …20[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts020]While the actions of consenting adults are a private matter, this incident is ofbiographical interest because it sheds light on his perspective. As Gerald Yorkestated about AC’s sexuality: “Crowley didn’t enjoy his perversions! He performedthem to overcome his horror of them.”21[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts021] Thus he followed the path ofthesis, antithesis, and synthesis to deprogram his mind of Victorian mores.22[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts022]Sitting in her Bou-Sâada hotel room, Jane Wolfe cursed Crowley’s name. Havingleft home a month ago, she had still to reach her destination. Complicatingmatters was a cryptic cable from Palermo:COMME CEFALUNobody could shed light on the missive. She had always said Los Angeles was themodern Athens, and it seemed preferable to the Mediterranean. An actor with thePathé Motion Picture Company, a French company filming on location in Bou-Sâada,finally provided the translation. “It is in English,” he remarked to hersurprise. “It says ‘Come Cefalù.’ ” Thus Jane made her way via Algiers, Tunis,and Sicily to the Hotel des Palmes in Palermo. Directed to a second-floorwaiting room, she relaxed with a heavy sigh, closing her eyes and resting herhead in her palm. Forty days of delays and itinerary changes since leaving LosAngeles left her exhausted.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_066_r1.jpg]Actress Jane Wolfe (1875–1958). (photo credit 14.2)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c14-fig002a]A man’s high, thin voice pierced the silence. “Do what thou wilt shall be thewhole of the Law.” She opened her eyes to find AC and Leah in the room with her.In that instant, all their romantic illusions shattered.Jane’s first thought was “filth personified.” Leah was unwashed and ungroomed,with charcoal-blackened fingers. Crowley, with a striped suit, walking stick,and hat, presented a more wholesome picture, but her clairvoyant sight presentedher with a terrifying vision of a bird trapped in mud. Likewise, the actressmade a disappointing first impression on Crowley. After months of anticipatingthe arrival of his “movie star,” he discovered she was older than heanticipated; she was also more masculine, haggard, and unattractive than he hadhoped. As he wrote in his diary, “I am like the girl who was to meet a ‘darkdistinguished gentleman’ and did, he was a nigger with one eye.”23[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts023]Proceeding to the Abbey the next morning, Jane encountered more rude surprises.It was as filthy as its inhabitants. Finding Ninette five months along in herpregnancy with only one man in the Abbey, Jane deduced Crowley was the father.Having come to Cefalù expecting to be Crowley’s lover, she found the job filledtwice over … not that she wanted to be his lover, on closer inspection.As a newcomer to the Abbey, Jane had three days to adjust to the schedule. Shestayed for a time in the Whore’s Cell, but ultimately ended up in the Abbey’ssecond building. Called the Umbilicus, it was the nursery where Ninette stayed,babysitting and cooking. After three days, Crowley put Jane on a rigorousschedule of yogic exercises and had her typing his manuscripts. Despite hisconstantly belittling her previous visions—particularly her Persian Master namedSchmidt—Jane finally understood that Beast was merely breaking down herpreconceptions. After a week or so, she relaxed enough for a new task: to helppaint the Chamber of Nightmares.La Chambre des Cauchemars was Crowley’s name for the main ritual room afterdecorating it with three grotesque and disturbing murals. Its north wall, dubbedLa Nature Malade, depicted hell as “false intellectual and moral consciousness”;it bore scenes such as “Japanese Devil-Boy Insulting Visitors,” “Faithful on theGallows” and “The Long-Legged Lesbians.” The wall depicting heaven, subtitled“The Equinox of the Gods,” encapsulated theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]teachings and Holy Books with the theme “Aiwass gave Will as a Law to Mankindthrough the mind of The Beast 666.” The mural of earth, finally, depicted lovein terms of the base desires it spawned. “The purpose of these pictures is toenable people, by contemplation, to purify their minds,”24[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts024] Crowley wrote. Once unaffectedby this lurid sensuality, Crowley believed, the mind was clear of thelife-negative taboos and mores of Judeo-Christian culture.“There, in the corner, are Lesbians as large as life,” Crowley would tellvisitors. “Why do you feel shocked and turn away: or perhaps overtly turn tolook again? Because, though you may have thought of such things, you have beenafraid to face them. Drag all such thoughts into the light … ’tis only your mindthat feels any wrong.… Freud endeavors to break down such complexes in order toput the subconscious mind into a bourgeois respectability. That is wrong—thecomplexes should be broken down to give the sub-conscious will a chance toexpress itself freely.…”25 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts025]Poupée became so sick that Leah took her to the doctor in Palermo on October 8.Although the parents desperately attempted sex magick to cure her, Beast was sogrief-stricken that he broke off the operation. On October 11, Poupée went intothe hospital. The following day, Crowley passed what he considered his saddestbirthday. Waiting and worrying, he returned to Cefalù and tried to lose himselfin poetry and painting. It was useless.On October 14, Leah came home alone. Her heavy sobs said everything. Shatteredby grief, Crowley led her into the main temple and pronounced a blessing onPoupée’s soul. In her diary, Leah recorded the tragedy:A Thelemite doesn’t need to die with a doctor poking at him. He finishes up whathe has to do and then dies. That’s what Poupée did. She didn’t pay attention toanything or anybody. Her eyes grew filmy and she died with a grin on her face.Such a wise grin.26 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts026]Leah was inconsolable, her grief impenetrable. She would not heed Beast’s adviceto rest and began suffering nocturnal pains, followed on October 18 by heavyspotting. Although Beast sent Ninette after a midwife, it was too late. Besideslosing her daughter, Leah had miscarried. She was so far along in her pregnancythat they had to call in a surgeon. “I stood as if petrified in the studio whilein the next room the surgeon drew forth the dead from the living,” Crowleywrote. Learning that the unborn child would have been a boy, he added, “My brainwas benumbed. It was dead except in one part where slowly revolved a senselesswheel of pain.”27 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts027] In the endit was Leah, suffering physical and psychological loss, who mustered herremarkable inner strength to urge Beast to persevere in the Great Work despitethe tragedy.When Leah noticed that Ninette, who’d always envied her place beside Beast,experienced an uncomplicated pregnancy, she convinced herself that Ninette hadcaused her misfortune. On November 3, after another of Leah’s tirades, Beasthumored her and skimmed through Ninette’s diary. (At the Abbey, all residentsmade their magical records available to Beast for perusal and comment.) What heread made him feel physically ill. Her diary’s hostility and jealousy convincedhim that Ninette’s negativity had indeed claimed the lives of both infants. Heentered the temple and exorcized the shadow. Banishment was the only solution,so he left a note for Beauty:Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Initiation purges. There is excreted a stench and a pestilence. In your case twohave been killed outright, and the rest made ill. There are signs that theprocess may lead to purification and things made safe within a short time. Butwe cannot risk further damage; if the hate is still in course, it had bettercoil back on its source. Keep your diary going carefully. Go and live in Cefalùalone; go to the hospital alone; the day before you come out send up your diary,and I will reconsider things. I shall hope to see the ulcers healing. Do notanswer this; simply do as I say.Love is the law, love under will.66628 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts028]On November 5, Ninette left the Abbey and went into Palermo to have her baby.She gave birth on Friday, November 26, to a daughter, whom Crowley named AstarteLulu Panthea; he readmitted Shummy to the Abbey.C. F. Russell arrived at the Abbey on November 21, full of stories of hisexploits of the last two years: how, as a Pharmacist Mate First Class aboard theUSS Reina Mercedes in Annapolis, he injected forty grains of cocaine on November24, 1918, as a magical experiment, resulting in his December 12 discharge;29[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts029] how he made his way to Detroitin May 1919 and helped with the Great Work there; and how he applied for apassport on October 11, 1920—with Ryerson vouching for him—so he could come toItaly for study.30 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts030] Hissailor’s coarseness estranged him from the residents, prompting Beast todescribe him as “a husk of 100% American vulgarity which conceals a GreatAdept.”31 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts031] Jane Wolfe was notso kind:From the way Russell has done the odd jobs around here, I am bound to say heeither lacks intelligence, lives in another world entirely … or does not careespecially how a thing is done.32[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts032]Crowley nevertheless saw his potential. Shortly after arriving at the Abbey, hebecame a Probationer in theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]as Frater Genesthai, and Beast prepared to conduct, with him and Leah, the firstmajor magical operation since 1918’s Amalantrah Working.The Cephaloedium Working had three goals: to inspire Crowley to finish writing acommentary on The Book of the Law; to invoke Hermes and Apollo; and to obtaintrue understanding of the tarot trump “The Tower.” The participants includedLeah, who ceremonially wore a scarlet Abbai girt with a sword; Russell, who worea black robe with a gold lining; and Crowley, who wore orange and bore aJanus-headed wand entwined with four serpents. They began with a banquet of fishand yellow wine, then, after appropriate banishings, purifications andconsecrations, took an oath:Hear all that we, To Mega Therion 9°=2DA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]The Beast; Alostrael, The Scarlet Woman; and Genesthai 0°=0°A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]do now in The Presence of TAHUTI most solemnly swear to devote ourselves to theEstablishment of The Book of the Law as authored by Aiwaz 93 to 666 by the Wayof the Cephaloedium Working as in the record thereof it hath been written.After invoking the gods by song and dance in the tradition of the Paris Working,AC and Leah disrobed and got Russell high on ether. Their intent was to coax himto make love to Crowley, who would thereafter make love to Leah; scryings andprophecies would follow thereafter. Unfortunately, the plan failed. As Russellrecalled,Your Circean enchantment didn’t give me a bone-on—add that Ethyl Ether is noaphrodisiac—you were in bed between me and the Virgin (sic) Guardian of theSangraal who had to lean over you to do what she did and you played down in theRecord—in fact more than merely to shake the hand of a stranger faire gonflerson andouille.33 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts033]The working ultimately ended on a sour note, Beast deeming it a failure onJanuary 20, 1921.With the unhappy end of the Cephaloedium Working, Beast and Leah traveled toPalermo. With a vow to “give the body to whoever should desire it,”34[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts034] the lovers parted, AC headingto Paris to recruit new students while Leah stayed in town with their landlord,Baron Carlo la Calce. Monsieur Bourcier again let Crowley stay on credit in hisHôtel de Blois at 50 rue Vavin. Nina Hamnett, who saw Crowley regularly at thistime, found him despondent and miserable, shattered by Poupée’s death. Afterpassing the hospital where Poupée had been born, he retreated to the forest ofFontainebleau, a place that had always been special to him, and broke downsobbing.Hamnett introduced Crowley to budding writer and poet Mary Francis Butts(1890–1937), who contributed to The Little Review and The Transatlantic Review.One might call her literary and artistic interests hereditary: her grandfather,Thomas Butts, had been a patron of poet, artist, and Gnostic Catholic SaintWilliam Blake (1757–1827).35 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts035]Her father, likewise, befriended several pre-Raphaelite artists. Butts andCrowley shared a lot in common: Mary was very close to her father, who died in1904 when she was thirteen. Like Crowley, she lived on a small annuity from herinheritance but tended to over-spend. Also like Crowley, she attended college(from 1909 to 1912) without completing a degree. After a string of lesbianrelationships during the war years, Butts married Jewish writer and publisherJohn Rodker (1894–1955) in 1918, and had a child in November 1920. She had aserious and long-standing interest in the occult and had even spent time theprevious year studying Éliphas Lévi’s works at the British Museum. Fair andwinnowy, her beaming blue eyes, fiery red hair, and boundless energynevertheless made her seem immense. Of her, Crowley later wrote, “My relationswith her were never very intimate. We enjoyed exchanging views.”36[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts036]When she met Crowley in 1921 she was in the process of separating from herhusband and forging an emotional and spiritual bond with writer James AlexanderCecil Maitland (d. 1926). Maitland was “a lovable but dilapidated Scotch‘aristocrat’ ”37 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts037] whosegrandfather worked on the Revised Version of the Bible, and whose father was aCatholic clergyman. Interested in magic and the occult from an early age, he wasknown to draw chalk circles on the floor of his Belsize Park apartment andattempt various conjurations. Butts and Maitland had, the previous year,ritually bonded by cutting crosses on each other’s wrists, sucking and kissingthe other’s wound.Crowley instructed them both in basic techniques of magic, meditation, and yoga,and conducted several experiments with them in astral projection. Butts excelledat the latter, referring to herself as a “secular Isis.” Butts’s journals fromthis period include long entries detailing her magical practices, astralvisions, and spiritual meditations. On March 11 she took her I° initiation intoOTO,38 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts038] and on the 18th Crowleytaught her the “gnostic cross.”39[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts039] She approached Crowley withcaution, noting “Aleister is an assistance, not a good or an evil. It is a goodpractice to notice a phenomena and its antithesis.… In that case it dependedwhich way you looked.”40 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts040]However, she would later write of Crowley, “I believe the Beast to be atechnical expert of the highest order.”41[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts041] Her impressions of Thelemawere likewise favorable, noting in her diary, “I believe in ‘Do what thou wilt’etc.”42 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts042]When Crowley invited the couple to stay at the Abbey, they hesitated at first.As Butts noted in her journal, “Aleister Crowley must know by now that we areplaying for time with regard to Cefalù, i.e., that we won’t come to him unlessdriven there by poverty or are reassured as to his intentions.”43[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts043] Whatever their reservations,they were evidently assuaged, as Butts and Maitland would arrive that summer fora stay at the Abbey.Hamnett also introduced Crowley to John Wilson Navin Sullivan (1886–1937),former mathematical and scientific reviewer for the London Times and Athenaeum.His friend Aldous Huxley described him as having “a very clear, hard, acuteintelligence, and a very considerable knowledge, not merely on his ownsubjects—mathematics, physics and astronomy—but on literature and music. Astimulating companion.”44 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts044]Educated at University College, London, he had broad interests in science,mathematics, literature, and music, and contributed articles to newspapers andperiodicals. He even wrote a novel, An Attempt at Life.45[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts045] In the years to follow,Sullivan would establish himself as one of the foremost popularizers of science,combining his love of mathematics, physics, philosophy, and music into classicbooks like Aspects of Science, Beethoven: His Spiritual Development, and TheLimitations of Science.46 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts046] Hewas one of the few people in Britain to understand the theory of relativity whenit was first introduced, and when Einstein visited the University of London,Sullivan was the only journalist able to discuss it in Einstein’s nativeGerman.47 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts047] His interest in theintersection of science and aesthetics made him a natural foil for Crowley’sthinking; the following quote from Aspects of Science easily could have flowedfrom AC’s own pen:Mathematics, as much as music or any other art, is one of the means by which werise to a complete self-consciousness. The significance of mathematics residesprecisely in the fact that it is an art; by informing us of the nature of ourown minds it informs us of much that depends on our minds.48[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts048]They spent long nights playing chess and discussing mathematics. Sullivan had nointerest in the occult49 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts049] but,when he responded to Beast’s discussions of The Book of the Law by seeingnumerical theorems in its passages, Crowley excitedly invited him to the Abbeyto write a mathematical proof of Liber AL.Sullivan’s wife, (Violet) Sylvia Mannooch (b. 1896),50[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts050] was a beautiful, tragic figuretrapped in an unhappy marriage. They shared only a love of music, and Sullivan’spreoccupation with mathematics much eroded even this. Both realized theirrelationship was pointless. When Sullivan vowed to AC to find his true will,Sylvia became a greater hindrance. Crowley recalled, “He asked me point-blank totake her off his hands for a time.”51[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts051] Crowley agreed and told him,“You can have her back whenever you like by whistling for her.” It was a replayof his affair with Ratan Devi at the behest of her husband.As in the original liaison, Sylvia became pregnant. She and Beast planned toreturn to Cefalù, where Sullivan would meet them and write his precis on LiberAL. Sullivan, however, met them at the dock during lunch and demanded, “I wantSylvia back.”“Righto!” Crowley nodded his head, stuffing food in his mouth and swallowing.“I’ll have to get the cabin changed and take a few of Sylvia’s things out of mytrunk.”52 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts052] The scene was aperfect picture of irony, with Crowley agreeable, Sylvia enraged, and Sullivanflabbergasted. In the end, Crowley returned to Cefalù alone. Sylvia would die oftyphoid shortly thereafter.53 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts053]Over the years, the relationship between Fratres Merlin Peregrinus and Baphomethad grown strained: Crowley had lost respect for the head of OTO, findingReuss’s experience in the IX° to be unsatisfactory and nearly nonexistent. As ACwrote of Reuss, “He told me that he had applied it with success but twice in hiswhole life.”54 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts054] Likewise,Reuss’s own doubts about Crowley resulted in bitter correspondence wherein hedenounced The Book of the Law; however, when he visited Beast in Palermo, it wason civil terms. No record survives of this summit. However, when Reuss suffereda stroke shortly thereafter, Crowley claimed to have been named his successor asOuter Head of the Order, pending election by all the world heads. Four yearswould pass before the appointment was ratified.Beast returned to the Abbey on April 6, where the following two months passed inmiserable dullness. Although he concluded this signified the end of a magicalcycle—and the I Ching confirmed this—he was unsure what to do next. Everyone, itseemed, was poor, depressed, and ill. Around May 20, as the sun entered the signof Gemini, he and Leah conducted an operation of sex magick designed to releasewithin her the power of Babalon. Although, in Leah’s mind, the ritualtransformed her from simply being a Scarlet Woman, consort to the Beast, intoBabalon herself, for Crowley the lull continued.Then, on May 23, another inspiration seized Crowley. Sitting at his desk, heknew it was time to take the most awful obligation possible. He scribbled in hisdiary, “I am mortally afraid to do so. I fear I might be called upon to do someinsane act to prove my power to act without attachment.” Then, at 9:34 p.m., hismind became calm. “As God goes, I go,” he told himself. Discarding his clothes,he entered the temple with Leah at his side. There, before his Scarlet Woman andall the powers of the universe as his witness, Crowley took the Oath of anIpsissimus, (10°=1°), the final grade in theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]hierarchy. The oath began his final and greatest initiation, one that would notsee its conclusion until 1924. In his diary, he wrote:I am by insight and initiation an Ipsissimus; I’ll face the phantom of myself,and tell it so to its teeth. I will invoke Insanity itself, but having thoughtthe Truth, I will not flinch from fixing it in word and deed, whatever come ofit.Along with the grade came the obligation never to advertise its attainment. Thisvow Crowley kept his entire life, the only hint of his attainment appearing inMagick in Theory and Practice (1929), where, among a catalog of his attainmentsup to the grade of Magus, he wrote that his holy guardian angel “wrought also inme a Work of Wonder beyond this, but in this matter I am sworn to hold mypeace.”55 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts055]By 10:05 p.m., Crowley was back at his desk.Having had enough of Jane’s obstinate preconceptions and asinine visions, Beastdecided she needed a magical retirement. It would span a month and involve sixdaily meditations: in the first week, these would each last thirty minutes; inthe second week, the meditations would be an hour long; by the fourth week, shewould be meditating twelve hours a day. Wolfe reacted poorly, however, whenCrowley instructed her to go to the top of the rock of Cephaloedium for a month.“You’re crazy,” she told him.“A boat leaves for Palermo in the morning,” he replied calmly but firmly,pointing to the open door of the Whore’s Cell. “There’s the door.”When she grudgingly agreed to the retirement and Crowley told her she could takenothing with her—no books, games, visitors or other distractions—she objectedagain. “What am I supposed to do?”Beast smiled sagaciously. “You will have the sun, moon, stars, sky, sea, anduniverse to read and play with.”Unconvinced, she nevertheless began her retirement on June 13 on a secluded partof the beach designated by Crowley. Russell transported and pitched AC’sHimalayan tent, which she regarded disparagingly because the wardrobe trunk shebrought to Cefalù was nearly the same size. Beginning the retirement, she vowednot to speak, except to reply “Love is the law, love under will” when Russellbrought her meals—typically grapes, a loaf of bread, and a jug of water.Emotions washed over her that first day: she was nervous lest nothing happen.She missed the niceties of her Hollywood life and resented the rocks beneath herthat made her bed and floor uncomfortable. Although angry at Crowley, shenevertheless determined to succeed.Jane awoke the next morning feeling as if the ground beneath her was rocking andswaying. Looking out the door, she found the tent surrounded by the water of thehigh tide. Fortunately, Crowley and Russell had appeared to check on her andmoved the tent back to dry ground. After that, her retirement proceeded asscheduled. Although she grew calm, boredom persisted. To amuse herself betweenmeditations, she exercised and swam naked in the water. Finally, after nineteendays of solitude, her thoughts dissolved into “perfect calm, deep joy, renewalof strength of courage.”56 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts056]Looking about, she understood what Crowley meant about the world being her toy.She had found both herself and a fulfilling spirituality.At the end of the retirement, Jane returned to the Abbey looking better thanever. Not only had her disposition changed, but the exercise and diet trimmedoff sixteen pounds.Mary Butts and Cecil Maitland arrived at the Abbey on July 5, 1921, and wereenchanted by the summer weather and setting. Butts arrived having recentlyoutlined her objectives in studying magick:I. I want to study and enjoy, and to enter if I can into the fairy world, themythological world, and the world of the good ghost story.II. I want by various mystical practices and studies to produce my true nature,and enlarge my perceptions.III. I don’t only want to find my true will. I want to do it. So I want to learnhow to form a magical link between myself and the phenomena I am interested in.I want power.IV. I want to find out what is the essence of religion, study the various ideasof God under their images.V. I want to make this world into material for the art of writing.VI. I want to observe the pairs of opposites, remembering that which is below isas that which is above. From this I wish to formulate clearly, the hithertoincommunicable idea of a third perception. This is a perception of the nature ofthe universe as yet unknown to man, except by intuitions which cannot beretained, and by symbols whose meaning cannot be retained also. I want to fix itin man’s mind.VII. I want to write a book not about an early theocracy and fall of man, … buta book written about the subject, historically, under terms of human fallibilitywithout deification of Pythagoras or the writers of the Kabala.… A book to showthe relation of art to magic, and shew the artist as the true, because theoblique adept.57 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts057]In Thelemic parlance, it was her Will to be a writer, and she looked to magickto give her both discipline and subject matter for writing. Thus, while stayingat the Abbey, she worked on editing her novel Ashe of Rings (1925).58[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts058] However, writing was but oneof her activities. There were, of course, the Abbey’s mandated activities andlectures. But she also continued her experiments with astral projection andstudied Crowley’s unpublished works. These included Liber Aleph, his commentaryon The Book of the Law, and the third part of Book Four which would later becomeMagick in Theory and Practice. As she read Magick, Butts made a number ofrecommendations on the content and additional topics for the Master Therion tocover. In his Confessions, Crowley acknowledged his debt to her:I practically re-wrote the third part of Book Four. I showed the manuscripts toSoror Rhodon (Mary Butts) and asked her to criticize it thoroughly. I amextremely grateful to her for her help, especially in indicating a large numberof subjects which I had not discussed. At her suggestion, I wrote essay uponessay to cover every phase of the subject. The result has been the expansion ofthe manuscript into a vast volume, a complete treatise upon the theory andpractice of Magick, without any omissions.59[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts059]Judging from her Cefalù diaries, Butts struggled with many aspects of life atthe Abbey, her record punctuated by flashes of anger, disappointment, and doubt.She complained about the rationing of cigarettes, infrequent structuredteaching, uninhibited sexuality (even in the presence of children), and the factthat “both [Hirsig and Crowley] dope out of all reasonable proportion.”Privately, she also speculated that Poupée had died because Leah had neglectedher.60 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts060] Even while helping withMagick in Theory and Practice, she records a remark by Cecil Maitland regardingthe high esteem in which the Thelemites regarded Crowley: “it makes AC tragic,because he is a kind, wise, honourable, gentle man crucified by his utter beliefin his own teaching.”61 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts061]Nevertheless, she continued her magical work throughout, and offered suggestionson how to make the Abbey more inviting to other visitors.62[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts062]Reading Herodotus’ account of an Egyptian priestess copulating with a goat inthe course of a religious ceremony, Crowley pondered the occult significance ofthese “prodigies.” The unions of humans and animals was certainly sacred toancient cultures: the Egyptians venerated gods who had human bodies and animals’heads. Similar ideas appeared in Greek mythology, with the bull-headed Minotaurand the story of Leda and the swan. Other ancient religions around the worldtold similar tales. Thus Crowley suggested such a working. Leah agreed to act aspriestess. They got a goat, and the Scarlet Woman knelt naked on the ground,presenting herself to the indifferent beast. Crowley tried coaxing the goat tomount Leah, but the animal failed to respond to a human female. To save theritual from utter failure, Crowley took the goat’s place with Leah, as herecorded in his diary: “I atoned for the young He-goat at considerablelength.”63 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts063]On September 14, as their visit drew to a close, both Butts and Maitland signedA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]Probationers’ oaths. Oddly enough, they left for Paris two days later. Back inLondon, Butts continued her magical work and struggled with her ambivalence,writing, “ ‘Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.’ That is all right.But people are to be made aware of this by fear, coercion, bribery, etc., areligious movement re-enacted. The founder is to be Crowley and his gulled,doped women.”64 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts064] In the end,she concluded the Abbey was a sham. “I’d sooner be the writer I am capable ofbecoming than an illuminated adept, magician, magus, master of this temple oranother.”65 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts065]When Jane returned to the Abbey from her retirement, all were abuzz anticipatingthe arrival of Frank Bennett, VII°, Beast’s man from Australia. He was a seniormember in Crowley’s circle, both in terms of his fifty-five years of age and hiseleven years in theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg],and his visit posed a logistic puzzle: there was no room for him in the Whore’sCell, and the Umbilicus, as a nursery, was inappropriate for such an AugustBrother. Crowley asked Russell to give up his room for Bennett. The studentrefused, complaining that he needed to study and meditate. Jane, seeing Crowleybristle, quickly offered her room. At this point, however, the matter of a roomwas no longer the point. So the student sulked and the master stewed, untilBeast grabbed a towel and told Russell sharply, “Your work doesn’t matter atinker’s cuss. You’d better be out by the time I finish my bath.” However, hereturned from the beach to find Russell still entrenched in the room. ACultimately confronted him with the tack that had been so successful with Jane:he said he worried that Russell was working too hard and suggested he take aholiday from the Abbey for his own health.The student feared this meant banishment, so on July 18, the day after Bennettarrived, he climbed the rock of Cephaloedium and began a magical retirement.Cleaning his makeshift hut, he kept his mind active by counting the 273 handfulsof dirt and 219 small stones that he threw out. Then he brought in a stone slabto serve as an altar for the Thelemic Holy Books, a copy of the Stele ofRevealing, his magical knife, and the Greek Zodiacal cross that Frater Achad hadmade for him. Then, at 8 p.m., he did the Lesser Banishing Ritual and resolvednot to descend the rock for food or water for eight days. Less than an hourlater, he began acting like a Master of the Temple, interpreting every event asa particular dealing of God with his soul. Waking early the next morning, heproceeded with solar adorations and recitations of the Holy Books.Ninette, who considered Russell a child requiring gentle treatment, begged Beastto intervene. He simply shrugged his shoulders, “Let him come down. He’s upthere by no will of mine.” Crowley thought Russell had lost his mind. “He has nosense of proportion, and so mixes the planes that he attaches real importance tothe number of handfuls of dirt he finds in his hovel.”66[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts066] Ninette, however, carried arucksack of food and water up the rock. While Russell would neither talk noreat, he was grateful for the water. On July 24, after a week on the rock,Russell descended shortly after noon and slept on the nursery’s living roomfloor.67 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts067]As Crowley told the end of the story, the sound of his name being shoutedhoarsely awakened Beast from his lunchtime nap. He opened his eyes just in timeto see Russell, unshaven and bedraggled, drop a rucksack at his feet and run offwhooping. He had supposedly visited the barber for a shave but, after beinglathered, remembered his oath not to descend the rock for water and dashed outof the shop, shaving cream flying in all directions. When Crowley openedRussell’s rucksack, he found it full of incoherent diaries and concluded Russellhad lost his mind.Frank Bennett’s spiritual awakening occurred during a walk on the beach withLeah and Beast. The morning was cloudless and still, the sea a clear indigo.Although a poor swimmer, Bennett joined the other two in the water and afterwardsat naked with them in the shade, admiring the scenery. “Progradior,” Beastlaunched into a lecture, “I want to explain to you fully, and in a few words,what initiation means, what is meant when we talk of the Real Self, and what theReal Self is.” In speaking, he equated the holy guardian angel with thesubconscious mind: illumination began when one let it work without interferencefrom the conscious mind, for the conscious mind repressed impulses of thesubconscious, resulting in restriction and evil. “There is no sin butRestriction,” The Book of the Law said, and it applied here. The most ubiquitousurge, which was constantly repressed to the detriment to our mental and physicalhealth—and Freud concurred with this—was sex. Rather than treat it as anunfortunate and shameful accident of nature, AC saw it as a basic part ofhimself, not only physically but as a symbol of God’s ability to create.This was news to Bennett, who thought the holy guardian angel wassuper-conscious. If Crowley was right, then all he had to do was listen to hissubconscious. That was one meaning of “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole ofthe Law.” The revelation made his head reel. He next had a wild impulse. Ratherthan ignore it, he gave in. Bennett ran down the beach and jumped into thewater, joined shortly thereafter by Leah and Crowley. After the swim, Bennettexcitedly asked Beast, “Please tell me again what you said just now.”“How the devil should I remember?” he asked, but with Bennett’s reminders, hereconstructed the discussion as best he could. Bennett smiled with satisfaction.“You have given me the key to the inmost treasury of my soul.”Returning to the Abbey, he pondered his illumination, musing, “I wish I knewthis before. It would have saved me a lot of misery.” Going to bed at eleventhat night, the churning in his mind kept him awake, and his head throbbedpainfully with a pressure within, threatening to split. Suffering for fourhours, suffocating, he rose from his sweat-soaked bed, threw open his window,and pressed his hands to his head to ease the pain. Then, palms to temples,Bennett dashed out into the night, gasping for air like a drowning man. Finally,a voice deep within instructed, “Breathe deep.” When he did, his body relaxed.He felt the sweat coating his skin, the stones and thorns pressing into hisfeet. The pain dissolved, and the pressure folded upon itself. Bennett returnedto the Abbey thirty minutes after leaving and quickly fell asleep. “Absoluteblackness pervaded my whole being,” he recorded in his journal.Bennett stayed in his room the next day and went to bed early. Hisclaustrophobia returned that evening, but one thought penetrated the chaos inhis brain. Bennett grabbed a piece of paper and desperately scribbled it down.What fools we men are! We make for ourselves a prison, and erect mirrors thatcover all the four walls of this prison; and not being satisfied with this, wecover the ceiling with a mirror as well. And these are our five senses whichreflect themselves in hundreds of forms until we are so befogged that we believethat these reflections of ourselves—of man as Man and Bull—are all that is. Butthere are a few who have examined these mirrors and polished them, anddiscovered that the more the mirrors are polished the less reflection they give.Then a time has come when they have found that they are not mirrors at all, butonly veils, and that one can see through the veils.68[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts068]Thus he understood that one could find one’s holy guardian angel.On the third night of his trance, Bennett’s mind remained placid. He felt nopain or discomfort, and he understood Thelema better. In his diary he recordedwhat, in his mind, was conclusive proof of the Law’s importance: “Our Father,which art in Heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom Come, Thy WILL be done …”Frank Bennett understood.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_067_r1.jpg]Frater Progradior, Frank Bennett (1868–1930). (photo credit 14.3)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c14-fig003a]As 1921 drew to a close, the Abbey’s visitors returned to their homes. Butts andMaitland’s appearance reputedly shocked their Parisian friends, with NinaHamnett describing them looking “like two ghosts and were hardlyrecognizable.”69 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts069] Goldring’sdescription of them in 1925, from South Lodge, shows no sign of thehealth-wrecked drug fiends he claimed the Abbey made of them; Butts would liveon for another fifteen years, while Maitland would commit suicide in 1926, theyear after he and Butts parted company.Frank Bennett, meanwhile, advanced to theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]grade of Adeptus Major (6°=5°) and the OTO grade of IX° during his stay. Beastgave him a X° charter as head of the Australian OTO on October 5, and, inNovember, Bennett returned to Australia to set up branches of OTO andA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg].The year 1922 began with a visit from Ninette’s two sisters. Her twin, Mimi,thought Crowley impressive, while Helen Fraux found him loathsome. When Beastthrew out the latter sister for trying to poison the children’s minds, she wentto the Palermo police with all sorts of wild stories. A resulting visit andsearch of the Abbey by the sotto-prefetto turned up nothing to validate hercomplaints. Shortly thereafter, Russell married Mimi and prepared to leave.Beast asked if he would visit Australia and help Bennett set up the order there.This he did, the cocky sailor finding Bennett “puffed up like a frog with theimportance of his recently gained grade of Adeptus Major in theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]and IX° in the OTO.”70 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts070] Withouta meeting of the minds, they simply traded copies of Crowley manuscripts andparted. Russell arrived back in the United States on January 28, 1922;71[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts071] years later, he would foundhis own Crowley-derived magical organizations, the Choronzon Club and GBG.Winter rolled in damp and cold, and brought with it the first snow in Cefalù’shistory. The unheated villa was miserable, driving Crowley and Leah, dispiritedand impoverished, back to Paris that February while Jane, back at the Abbey,sold Crowley’s liquor for spare change. AC again called on the Bourciers at 50rue Vavin, where they stayed on credit. Unable to muster any enthusiasm, hisattempts to recruit new students found no takers. “For the first time in mylife, Paris disappointed me,” Crowley wrote.72[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts072]On February 14, Crowley left Paris and returned to Fontainebleau (while Leahreturned to London). Here he stayed at Au Cadran Bleu, near the hospital wherePoupée had been born, and again confronted the painful memories of his recentlosses:I was so happy and hopeful here two years ago; and now my little Poupée has beendead over a year and her little brother never came to birth; and my manhood isin part crushed.73 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts073]Two years before, he had first been searching for an Abbey. Now he was broken inspirit and wallet. Furthermore, he was facing the ugly truth about himself:despite his philosophy about drug use, he had become addicted to heroin.Crowley decided to break his drug habit, setting up a progressive method ofweaning himself: each day there was a time he called “Open Season,” when hecould take as much heroin or cocaine as he wanted. “Closed Season” was theremaining part of the day when drug use was prohibited. His goal was to reducegradually the length of Open Season until Closed Season was twenty-four hours.He also planned to reduce his heroin intake during Open Season. He began onFebruary 15. He had taken no drug since 8 the previous evening, and only onedose that morning. By 4 o’clock that afternoon, he encountered the Storm Fiend,his name for withdrawal: “The acute symptoms arise suddenly, usually on wakingup from a nap. They remind me of the ‘For God’s sake turn it off’ feeling ofhaving an electric current passing through one.”74[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts074] Despite taking a 2 milligramdose of strychnine to help fight withdrawal and eating to reduce his craving,his withdrawal ran the classic course: mucous lined his throat, and thebronchitis that first drove him to heroin use reappeared. He felt emotionallyblunt and indifferent. Throughout, Crowley recorded his rationalizations fortaking the drug: “A small dose—to show my indifference to these considerations”;“Simply because I feel rotten”; “I felt no craving today, but … I had so muchexpectation that I took 3 small doses.”75[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts075]While cocaine proved easier to quit, his heroin need persisted. And although hefailed to stop heroin altogether, he did substantially reduce his intake. OnMarch 20 he recorded his “triumph over temporal trials.”76[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts076] He was kidding himself in theway any addict rationalizes his or her behavior. Drug addiction would continueto weigh heavily on Crowley’s mind. Over two years later, he would write toNorman Mudd,I have thought the matter over very thoroughly in the last few weeks, and cangive you (at last) a considered judgement.1 I have never maintained that any man could stop at any time under anycondition.2 Favorable conditions are that a man should a) will to stop, b) know his TrueWill, c) be able to take steps to carry it out, d) be free from physicallydepressing stress.3 I’m all right for a and b. For c I should be all right if I were all right asto d.4 Given, therefore, that I am safely entrenched at Hardelot or some such place,I think there should be little or no trouble in stopping either suddenly orgradually, as may seem desirable.77[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts077]Yet the same letter contains more rationalization: “a little solid heroin (thefirst in that form for two months—immediate violent activity) have made mebetter than my normal good form. I have certainly recovered my drug-virginity;which is clear proof that I can stop at will, the moment physical conditionspermit of my throwing a little temporary strain on my constitution.” In the end,it would be the summer of 1924 before his drug addiction was broken.Back at the Abbey, Jane received instructions from Beast to spend two weeks in abrothel to get a healthy idea about sex. Interpreting this as a great spiritualordeal, she applied to the local brothel to find the madam only interested incareer whores. Undaunted, Jane propositioned la Calce; the landlord, however,had his eye on Ninette and promised to bring by some friends who might bewilling. Although he did bring one or two men to meet her, none returned for herfavors. Thus Jane, unwilling to walk the streets, resigned herself to failure.In May, Crowley joined Leah, who was waiting for him in London. Having nothingbut £10 and some Highland garb he had put into storage before the war, he pawnedhis watch and tried to raise money. His first thought was to sell his stock ofunsold books. Since Jacobi had published them, however, Chiswick Press hadchanged owners, and the new company refused to release the books because theyfound their imprint irregular. Try as he may, Crowley could not convince them torelease his books.He next called on English Review editor Austin Harrison (1873-1928), hoping toget back in touch with London’s editors and sell some manuscripts. Harrison wasthe same man who had introduced Crowley to Viereck in London before the war andwho had rejected Crowley’s “King of Terrors,’ thinking it was an unsubstantiatedfactual account.78 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts078] AlthoughCrowley was now unpopular in London, Harrison agreed to buy some pieces out offriendship and publish them pseudonymously. Some of them—the centennial articleon “Percy Bysshe Shelley,” “The Jewish Problem Re-Stated,” and “The Crisis inFreemasonry”—showed Crowley up on some soapbox or another, but failed toimpress. As Michael Fairfax, he offered the poems “Moon-Wane,” “The Rock,” and“To a New-Born Child.”79 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts079] Moreinteresting were two pieces he wrote on his newly enlightened view of drugaddiction. “The Drug Panic,” by a London Physician, was Crowley’s attack on therecent Dangerous Drugs Act, which made illegal the sale of drugs to whichCrowley was accustomed to purchasing from his local chemist. In a tellingautobiographical passage, Crowley complained, “The public is ignorant of theexistence of ‘a large class of very poor men’ who would die or go insane ifmorphine were withheld from them. Bronchitis and asthma, in particular, areextremely common among the lower Classes.…”80[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts080] Crowley had but littleexperience with morphine; in a 1932 letter he wrote, “I have not touchedmorphine in any form bar about a dozen minute doses by the mouth in 1917.”81[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts081] He claimed that ignoranceinspired the Dangerous Drugs Act and called instead for compulsory education.Crowley’s article “The Great Drug Delusion” (written under the pseudonym “a NewYork Specialist”) described his own drug delusion: “Though I obtained definitelytoxic results, I was always able to abandon the drug without a pang.”82[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts082] He again advocatedlegalization of drugs, claiming it would eliminate underground traffic. Towardthe end of the article appeared the germ of a new idea brewing in Crowley’smind:In the author’s private clinic, patients are not treated for their ‘habit’ atall. They are subjected to a process of moral reconstruction; as soon as this isaccomplished, the drug is automatically forgotten. Cures of this sort arenaturally permanent, whereas the possible suppression of the drug fails toremove the original causes of the habit, so that relapse is the rule.83[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts083]Of course, AC had no private clinic, and he treated no patients. But he had atheory: that drug use guided by morality and Will was harmless, and addictionoccurred from casual or indiscriminate use. While this was not his ownexperience, it was his interpretation of The Book of the Law’s “To worship metake wine and strange drugs whereof I will tell my prophet, & be drunk thereof!They shall not harm ye at all.”84[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts084] It worked on paper; he justneeded to test it.On May 24 he met with book publisher Grant Richards (1897–1948) and tried tosell him on a book idea. Richards’s firm had published books by Crowley’s old LeChat Blanc acquaintance Arnold Bennett, as well as G. K. Chesterton and GeorgeBernard Shaw. Offered Crowley’s autobiography, however, Richards demurred,doubting its marketability. Offered a shocker about drug addiction, Richardsagain declined, referring him to Hutchinson or Collins. On his way home, Crowleytherefore moved on to the firm William Collins. There, science fiction novelist,essayist, and literary advisor John Davys Beresford (1873–1947) liked the ideaof a drug shocker. Beresford, who started as an advertising writer, knew Crowleyfrom his days as the editor of What’s On:We had one remarkable contributor during my editorship, I may add, none otherthan Aleister Crowley, who was supplying a serial narrative something in themanner of Tom Hood, speckled with problems and puzzles, for the best solution ofwhich a money-prize was offered.85[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts085]Beresford had recently written articles on metaphysical topics for Harper’smagazine.86 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts086] Hisrecommendation, and Crowley’s forthcoming articles in the English Review,convinced Collins to take the book. On June 1, 1922, AC received a £60 advanceon the manuscript. He later admitted that, aside from a few chapter titles, “Ihad in fact no detailed idea of how the story would develop.”87[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts087]Crowley summoned Leah to his side and began dictating immediately. Intwenty-seven days, twelve hours, and forty-five minutes, Crowley dictated theentire 121,000-word text of The Diary of a Drug Fiend, a story of wretchedpharmacological excess and the redemption of its drug-crazed protagonists by thephilosophical code of Thelema. The book is inelegant and unimpressive; but,written in under a month, it was never intended as more than a potboiler.Throughout it appear thinly veiled caricatures of acquaintances and Abbeyresidents. For instance, Crowley modeled the hero of the story, Pendragon, afterCecil Maitland, who supposedly became an addict at the Abbey. Crowley himselfwas Mr. King Lamus. Most interesting was the book’s note to Part II:The Abbey of Thelema at “Telepylus” is a real place. It and its customs andmembers, with the surrounding scenery, are accurately described. The trainingthere given is suited to all conditions of spiritual distress, and for thediscovery and development of the “True Will” of any person. Those interested areinvited to communicate with the author of this book.88[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts088]When he wrote “The Great Drug Delusion,” his drug treatment clinic was just atheory. With this manuscript, Crowley prepared to make it a reality.When Crowley appeared in Collins’s office with the manuscript, the publishercouldn’t believe anyone could have written an entire novel since they lastspoke. But there it was on his desk. Impressive. When Crowley asked about hisautobiography, Collins considered the offer and paid him a £120 advance on themanuscript. They also offered to publish Crowley’s Simon Iff stories, promisingan advance by November 9, but this compilation never materialized.With the novel completed, Leah returned to the Abbey to recover from illness andto help Ninette, who was pregnant by their landlord. Crowley remained in Paris,visiting friends like writer Jane Burr (b. 1882–1958)89[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c14-nts089] and banker-patron of the artsOtto Kahn, hoping to find new students."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIFTEENADONIS“I shall kill myself and I shall kill you, too, if you don’t marry me,” RaoulLoveday insisted, thus becoming Betty May’s third husband in the summer of1922.1 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts001] They were wed at theregistry office in Oxford, where the groom was a student. Raoul was nervous,fumbled the wedding band, and dropped it on the floor. A photo of the newlyweds,taken in the gardens of St. John’s College, featured above Raoul’s head theapparition of a young man lying horizontally in slumber or death. All in all, itwas an ominous affair.Born Charles Frederick Loveday (1900–1923)—he would adopt the name “Raoul” whilea student at Oxford—he was a frail youth with an unhealthy pallor. Born inRangoon on July 3, 1900, he was one of two children to Royal Navy officer GeorgeLoveday (born c. 1859) and his wife, Amelia Ann Lewendon (b. 1859).2[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts002] Sickly since birth, malariastruck Raoul as a child while still living in Rangoon. They later moved to SouthLondon, raising their family at 112 Barry Road in East Dulwich.3[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts003]On Aug. 2, 1918, at age eighteen, he enlisted in the Inns of Court OfficersTraining Corps. Nicknamed “The Devil’s Own,” the Inns of Court were a volunteerbattalion, part of the London Territorial Force based in Berkhamsted,Hertfordshire, from September 1914 to June 1919.4[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts004] From there, Loveday attendedSt. John’s College, Oxford, where he studied history, played football (RaymondGreene said “he was very good”), wrote poetry, and became interested in theoccult.5 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts005] Betty May reportedthat his poetry had attracted critical attention, but Greene deemed it“remarkably bad.”6 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts006] One exampleappears in the journal Oxford Poetry:Sing now of LondonAt fall of dusk;A summer dragonfly—Crept from the husk.Dragonfly, on whose wingRun golden wires;So, down a street pavement,Lamps throw their fires.Dragonfly, whose wing is prickedBy many a spark;Electric eyes of taxisBright through the dark.Dragonfly, whose life isCold and brief as dew,Drone now for London dusk,Soon dead too.7 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts007]Loveday was also an early member of Oxford’s Hypocrites Club, whose latermembers included writers Evelyn Waugh (1903–1966), Anthony Powell (1905–2000),and Terence Lucy Greenidge (1902–1970). Originally the least fashionable ofOxford’s clubs—devoted to the discussion of philosophy—it soon developed araucous reputation. According to Evelyn Waugh, it was “notorious not only fordrunkenness but for flamboyance of dress and manner which was in some casespatently homosexual.”8 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts008] Lovedaywas in fact the club’s secretary;9[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts009] after one late night ofdrinking, he returned to Oxford after hours and tried to climb back into thecollege, managing only to impale himself on the gate railing, where he hungupside down by his thigh and nearly bled to death before help arrived. Hisextracurricular activities distracted the youth from his studies so much that hewas nearly sent down from St. John’s; to everyone’s surprise, he managed a firstclass in history, graduating in 1922.10[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts010][images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_068_r1.jpg]Raoul Loveday.

(photo credit 15.2) [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c15-fig002a]Betty May has been described by her friends as “A bad girl with a beautiful faceand a good heart.”11 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts011] Crowleyuncharitably called her “a half-crazy whore, who had been twice married and oncedivorced.”12 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts012] Born in Limehouseas Betty Marlow Golding,13 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts013] shegrew up in poverty. She worked as an artist’s model for a time, sitting forAugustus John, Jacob Kramer, and Jacob Epstein.14[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts014] Enjoying some celebrity, shemoved to Paris, became a heavy drug user, and claims to have been known amongApache robbers as the “Tiger Woman,” a name that stuck when she returned toEngland. Her first husband, an addict, left her a widow, and the second divorcedher over her own cocaine addiction before she was able to cure herself.15[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts015] Although she reports that shemet Raoul at the Harlequin, a Soho pub where she sang, Raoul’s sister gave aless romantic account: he attended an undergraduate’s party where all the menpresent placed their names in a hat to decide by lottery who would marry BettyMay. “Unlucky Raoul was the one,” she lamented.16[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts016] In any event, they marriedthree weeks later, in September.Loveday had discovered Crowley through reading The Oxford Book of Mystical Verseand struck up a correspondence with the poet.17[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts017] That fall, in 1922, he metBetty Bickers, wife of Sheridan Bickers, at the Harlequin. When she learned thatRaoul had been studying The Equinox for two years, she told him Crowley wasstaying with her at 31 Wellington Square, teaching her magick and givinglectures on Thelema. To Raoul’s delight, she arranged a meeting. Betty May, whohad been unimpressed with Crowley when she met him at the Café Royal in 1914,refused to accompany Raoul on the visit. So he went alone, and never came homethat night. Nor the next.A scraping at her third-story bedroom window woke Betty May out of a soundsleep. Switching on her light, she walked to the window, pulled aside thecurtain, and nearly cried out when she saw a face pressed up against the glass.Then she recognized the eyes that pleaded to her. They were Raoul’s. Betty threwopen the window to find her husband, covered with soot and stinking of ether,hanging from a drainpipe thirty feet off the ground. She grabbed his arms,pulled him inside, and undressed him. Although he passed out before he couldanswer any of her questions, answers were unnecessary. Raoul had obviously spentthree days with Crowley, who had exposed her husband to the vices that hadwrecked her previous marriages. Seduced by the romance of Betty’s bohemian days,Raoul was eager to experience the wild life that she now shunned. Crowleypointed the way for him. Raoul became devoted to mysticism and, even though hehad a £1,000 a year job lined up, lost his ambition for anything but magick.Betty’s fears came true when she answered her door one day to a portly,middle-aged bald man with a bottle of wine. “Do what thou wilt shall be thewhole of the Law,” he said.Raoul rushed up behind her and replied, “Love is the law, love under will.”The Beast smiled and politely kissed Betty’s stiff hand. He offered her thebottle and explained, “I’ve come to dinner.”She turned around to find Raoul simultaneously beaming at the Master and lookingsheepishly at his wife. Fury boiled over her face in the form of a furrowed browand tautly pressed lips. She grabbed her hat and coat and, passing AC in thedoorway, fired off one last shot. “I shan’t cook any meal for you.”She was scarcely two steps away when Crowley replied, “The day will come whenyou will cook all my meals for me.”Contrary to the preceding account of drain-climbing and menacing meals—drawnfrom Betty May’s memoirs18[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts018]—Crowley paints a strikinglydifferent picture of the couple. From his perspective, Betty wasn’t living theclean life that her memoirs claim she was, and the indulgent lifestyle to whichshe was exposing Raoul appalled Crowley. Recognizing the youth’s capacity formagick, AC wished to groom him as his successor, and so he invited the Lovedaysto Cefalù:I hope you will come p.d.q. and bring Betty. I honestly tell you that the besthope for your married life is to get out of the sordid atmosphere of ‘Bohemian’London.…Does it surprise you that the notoriously wicked A.C. should write thus? If so,you have not understood that he is a man of brutal commonsense and a loyalfriend. So come and live in the open air amid the beauty of Nature.… Beak Streetand Fitzroy Street are horrors unthinkable even in Rome; and Rome is a cesspoolcompared with Cefalù.The society of Scholars, of free women and of delightful children will indeed bea great change for Betty; but it is what she needs most. There is in her notonly a charming woman, but a good one; and she will develop unsuspected glories,given a proper environment. In London she has not one single decent influence,except your own; and however deeply and truly she may love you, she won’t beable to resist “la nostalgie de la boue” for ever.19[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts019]Raoul accepted enthusiastically, promising to join him later that month, andCrowley returned to the Abbey on November 4.In November, The Diary of a Drug Fiend appeared in bookstores. The pressresponded cooly to the book, the Times Literary Supplement calling it “aphantasmagoria of ecstasies, despairs, and above all verbiage,” and the New YorkTimes Book Review deeming it nothing more than a tract on Thelema.20[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts020] Few copies sold, and the bookwould ordinarily have vanished into obscurity had James Douglas of the SundayExpress not seen it. A proponent of the suppression of James Joyce’s Ulysses, hedubbed Crowley’s novel “A Book for Burning” in his November 19 article.I have therefore determined … to do my best to secure the immediate extirpationof The Diary of a Drug Fiend (Collins, 7/6 net) by Aleister Crowley. It is anovel describing the orgies of vice practised by a group of moral degenerateswho stimulate their degraded lusts by doses of cocaine and heroin. Althoughthere is an attempt to pretend that the book is merely a study of thedepravation caused by cocaine, in reality it is an ecstatic eulogy of the drugand of its effects upon the body and the mind. A cocaine trafficker wouldwelcome it as a recruiting agent which would bring him thousands of new victims.He called for the immediate suppression of this repulsive, blasphemous, obscenebook.The Sunday Express followed with a sensational front-page exposé:Black Record of Aleister CrowleyPreying on the DebasedHis AbbeyProfligacy and Vice in SicilyThe article reviewed the controversial aspects of his past: the suggestivetitles of books (such as The Honourable Adulterers), his Rites of Eleusis, andhis pro-German propaganda. It summed up Crowley’s literary record as “blasphemy,filth, and nonsense,” calling his books “either incomprehensible ordisgusting—generally both. His language is the language of a pervert, and hisideas are negligible.” Adding to the controversy was that a portrait of Crowley,by Ukrainian expatriate artist Jacob Kramer (1892–1962), was currently ondisplay at the Goupil Galleries. At the request of a Chelsea hostess, he agreedto do Crowley’s portrait; but after meeting his subject, Kramer avoided workingon it until, after much prodding, he produced it in a single sitting.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_069_r1.jpg]The Beast 666 by Jacob Kramer (1892–1962). (photo credit 15.3)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c15-fig003a]The article also gave “details” of Crowley’s orgies, which they claim involvedsmelly cakes made with goat’s blood. “Suffice it to say that they are horriblebeyond the misgivings of decent people.” The article then described theinhabitants of the Abbey:Three women he keeps there permanently for his orgies. All of them he broughtfrom America two or three years ago. One is a French-American governess, one anex-schoolmistress, and one a cinema actress from Los Angeles.Whenever he needs money, and cannot get it from fresh victims, he sends them onthe streets of Palermo or Naples to earn it for him. He served once a prisonsentence in America for procuring young girls for a similar purpose.The French-American governess has two children (of which he is the father), wholive in the midst of the debauchery. The children of the schoolmistress by himare dead.21 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts021]The source of these exaggerations and untruths was Mary Butts.Butts, seeing her lover and herself painted unflatteringly as the protagonistsof The Diary of a Drug Fiend, provided anonymous information to the SundayExpress as a means of striking back at Crowley. Butts also fictionalized detailsof Crowley’s abortive ritual with Leah and the goat: in her version, Leah andthe goat did copulate, and Crowley, at the moment the goat climaxed, slit itsthroat, spilling blood over Leah’s back. When the Scarlet Woman stood and lookedhelpless, asking “What should I do now?,” Butts, cool and collected, reputedlylit a cigarette and jibed, “If I were you, I’d take a bath.” Aside from anuncharacteristic portrait of Leah as a lost sheep, it also raised the questionof how an observer knows when a goat is climaxing. According to Butts’s journal,she was not even present for the ritual;22[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts022] she repeated it to the SundayExpress as hearsay and injected herself into the story as an observer to deliverthe punch line. Regardless, the story circulated widely and passed unchallengedas fact.23 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts023] Ironically, beforethe controversy over The Diary of a Drug Fiend finally died down, Butts’s firstbook, Speed the Plough and Other Stories (1923), would be listed alongsideCrowley’s in John Bull’s article “Books We’d Like to Burn.”24[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts024]Crowley chalked up James Douglas’s initial review to the inanity peculiar to theSunday Express, but the November 26 attack was pure libel. Alas, he was now sobroke that he managed to return to Cefalù only through a £20 advance from AustinHarrison; initiating libel proceedings was financially impossible, particularlyas defending the infamous Aleister Crowley would require a great barristerindeed. However, he planned to send Jane Wolfe, accused of being a prostitute,to London, thinking she would stand a better chance of winning damages. Even asmall settlement would allow Crowley to prepare his own large and expensivelawsuit.By the time the book was released in America the following summer, the pressthere remarked “Aleister Crowley has written a new book which is said to havemade a bigger sensation in London than Jurgen did in America.”25[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts025][images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_070_r1.jpg]An ad for the American edition of The Diary of a Drug Fiend. (photo credit 15.4)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c15-fig004a]Despite—or perhaps because of—the controversy, Éditions Kemplen of Paris wroteto Crowley on April 2, 1924, proposing a French translation. The press, however,was short-lived, and this edition never appeared.26[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts026]En route to the Abbey, the Lovedays broke camp in Paris to visit Nina Hamnett.When the artist learned that Raoul was heading for Cefalù to be Crowley’ssecretary, she became concerned. Raoul had been very ill, his handsome facestill corpse-like, and she believed the Mediterranean heat, mosquitoes, and foodwould delay his recovery. “If you go to Cefalù now, you’ll die,” she insisted,urging him to recuperate first. But Raoul pressed on, determined to find hisdestiny at the Abbey of Thelema.On Sunday night, November 26—the day the Sunday Express launched its front-pageassault on Crowley—the Lovedays arrived at the Abbey. Their first act asvisitors was to read and sign the Oath of Affiliates, stating that they agreedto live by the Abbey’s rules:I, willing to abide within the Abbey of Thelema, make Oath and sign: that I doutterly deny, abjure and condemn all allegiance soever to all gods and men,accepting the Law of Thelema as my sole Law:that I affirm The Book of the Law to be the Word of Truth and the Rule of Life:that I dedicate myself utterly and without stint my body and soul to the GreatWork which is to proclaim and execute the Law of Thelema:that I will accept unquestionably and irrevocably the conditions of life in theAbbey of Thelema, and uphold its ordinances and customs (as declared in theBooks LII, CI, CXCIV) and maintain the authority of the Scarlet Woman and of herLord the Beast 666.27 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts027]With the waiver signed, Beast formally accepted them as visitors to the Abbey.Given the Sunday Express articles, Raoul sent a reassuring note home:Dear Mum and Dad,Another line just to let you know how happy and comfortable we both are. Also tolet you know that the articles in the Sunday Express, about the man in an annexeof whose house we are staying, are absolute lies, and written by an enemy. Hewas in the Secret Service in America; and had to pretend to be pro-German: hencethey have a good opportunity to attack. An answer has been sent showing thatevery word is untrue. He has been as nice to us as anyone could be; and RobinsonSmith is his friend. I thought I’d just send you this so that you couldcontradict it and needn’t worry. Best wishes.Your loving son,Fred28 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts028]Betty also sent a letter confirming what their son had written:All the things you have read in the Sunday Express are absolutely untrue.Crowley is quite nice and this house is well conducted. I give you my word ofhonour and we are very happy and we are looking much better and feeling it. Weget up at 7.30 and go to bed at 8 o’clock so you see what a healthy life we arereally leading but when we come back you will see for yourself how well we look.I hope you are all well and not worrying a little bit.29[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts029]In all, they sent eight letters to Raoul’s parents, assuring them over and againthat the Sunday Express was lying about Crowley.Raoul loved the Abbey from the first morning he awoke to the sound of tom-tomsand praises to the rising sun. “I cannot express my feeling of exaltation as Istood there inhaling the sweet morning air.”30[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts030] He climbed rocks and performedthe rituals he had been studying, now under the tutelage of the Master.According to Betty May,Raoul spent most of the days playing chess with the ‘Beast’ in his study, orporing over books on magic. There were various magical incantations, includingthe killing of a cat because it was an ‘evil spirit,’ and the ‘Beast’ would, onstate occasions, appear for some ceremony clad in gorgeous robes and wielding aword or colored wand.31 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts031]He soon became anA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]Probationer, taking the magical name of Frater Aud (the magical light, whencethe term odic force). Raoul quickly ascended to the position of being Crowley’sfavorite pupil ever. Neuburg, for all his manifesting mediumship, and Achad,despite discovering the Key, had both strayed from the Path; but Raoul was abrilliant and devoted student, and AC felt they had a powerful magical currentin full swing.Betty, however, reacted unfavorably to life at the Abbey, and made lifemiserable for everyone by refusing to cooperate with the rules. At one point,she got so fed up with holding a basin for Crowley as he ate that she dumped thewater over his head; amidst the breathless silence that followed, Beast simplycontinued his meal nonchalantly. In another incident, Betty pulled a gun on him.Crowley admired her pluck and spirit, and he responded as the insidious jesterthat was so much a part of him: one day at dinner, he announced that they wouldsacrifice Betty at dawn. After the color drained from her face, she saw Raoulchuckling at the comment. She was so frightened that she sneaked away from theAbbey that night, and Raoul had to find her and assure her it was just a joke.In time, Betty warmed up to Beast. Particularly memorable was the day they bothclimbed the Rock of Cephaloedium. Betty was surprised at the deftness andagility of this fat forty-seven-year-old man, and comforted by his gentlereassurance: “Remember, it is I who will get hurt first.”One day, he suggested the Lovedays take a break from the Abbey’s rigors and getsome fresh air and exercise. Thus he sent them hiking to the monastery thirteenmiles away. On the return trip, they stopped by a spring to rest. Parched, Raouldipped his hand into the water. “Raoul,” his wife interrupted, “remember whatBeast said about drinking the water?” He had advised against it. Frater Audshrugged his shoulders, cupped water in his hands, and drank. He sighed deeplyand, seeing Betty’s surprise at his disregard for his Master’s directions,explained, “If I didn’t have a drink, I should have died.”Winter hit the Abbey hard in January 1923. The air was cool, the sky constantlyovercast, and the concrete walls and floor of the Abbey were icy slabs. Nosooner had Leah recovered than the “Cefalù plague” struck Crowley down withemphysema, asthma, and bronchitis. Shortly thereafter, Raoul suffered arecurrence of his childhood malaria, but nevertheless continued the Great Work,going on astral journeys and reporting his visions.When February came around and neither Crowley nor Raoul improved, they calledDr. Maggio, president of the district hospital. He diagnosed Raoul with a liverinfection. Although the doctor represented the best possible care, Crowley, notplacing his faith entirely in the hands of Aesculapians, calculated Raoul’shoroscope and its progressions; his face turned grim as he looked at theaspects. “It looks as if you might die on the 16th of February at 4:00.”On February 10, matters at the Abbey became tense, and a fight broke out betweenBetty and Ninette. The Tiger Woman had called Shummy a slob and refused to workwith her. The others appeared, Crowley siding with Betty, Leah defendingNinette, and Jane listening silently. In the end, Crowley suggested that, witheveryone sick lately, discipline had slipped and that they must all try harderto live together and pursue higher goals.Things erupted again the next day. Although Beast had banned newspapers from theAbbey—encouraging students to read literature, philosophy, and magic in theAbbey library instead—he agreed to rethink his policy and discuss it with Betty.When she failed to meet him as scheduled, he came to Raoul’s room and, in orderto get her attention, snatched the London paper from her hands. Betty reactedviolently, first screaming and cursing, then grabbing anything that wasn’tnailed down and throwing it at the Master Therion. His suggestions that theystep outside of the sick room and speak civilly only met with more flyingcrockery. When Crowley resorted to restraining her, she swung and kicked at himdefiantly. Finally Raoul, barely strong enough to stand, staggered between themand persuaded Betty to calm down.That evening, Betty packed her bags and left the Abbey, dropping into the mail anote that Raoul had written to his parents earlier that day:Forgive me for not having written before but I have had a very sharp bout ofmalaria which has left behind it a persistent diarrhoea. I have had this forabout ten days now and it has left me as weak as water. As you see I have had toget Betty to write this letter for me. The doctor here is giving me variousthings but I do not seem to be making much headway. I trust, however, that bythe time you get this letter I shall be quite well. Betty, herself, has beenunable to keep anything in her stomach for the last week but I think she is juston the turn now. I believe that the air or the water or something here, perhapsthe place, does not agree with me. If I can earn enough without having to spendit on the doctor or on the other million extras which surround one in a foreigncountry if one wants any comfort, if I can do this I think I shall come back.On the back of this letter, Betty had appended her own note:Dear Mrs. Loveday,Raoul doesn’t know I am writing and I hope you will not tell him anything I havewritten on this page to you. I really think Raoul is very very ill and if hedoesn’t come home soon he will be too weak to be moved.32[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts032]Betty went to Palermo, where she lodged a complaint against Crowley with theBritish consul. As it turns out, His Majesty’s Consul for the Compartimento ofSicily and the Sicilian Islands was Reginald Gambier MacBean (1859–1942),33[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts033] a Theosophist and Co-Mason whobecame the Italian Grand Master of the Ancient and Primitive Rite ofMemphis-Mizraim in July 1921. Although Spence suggests that this fact may haveworked in Crowley’s favor,34 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts034]it may actually have done quite the opposite: after John Yarker died in 1913,Crowley opposed the participation of Theosophist and Co-Mason James IngallWedgwood in the election of Yarker’s successor as Sovereign Grand Master Generalof the Rite,35 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts035] an act thatwould not have endeared Crowley to those closely allied camps. Furthermore—givenAC’s claim to have distilled the Memphis-Mizraim ceremonies into its rituals—OTOwould have been viewed as spurious by the Ancient and Primitive Rite. Indeed, inhis history of the Rite, MacBean wrote that he revived Memphis-Mizraim in Italyin order “to prevent a spurious revival of the Memphis Rite with political aimsin Italy, which would have compromised the regular Obedience of the Memphis Ritein Palermo.”36 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts036] Thus, Betty’scomplaint could have set into motion, or contributed to, a disastrous chain ofevents for ACThe next day, February 12, Leah found Betty and gave her a romantic note fromRaoul, wherein he begged his wife to return to his side. As she read the note,her anger dissolved. She dropped the charges and returned with Leah.They summoned Dr. Maggio again when Raoul took a turn for the worse on February14. This time, he revised his diagnosis as acute enteritis, an intestinalillness common in the Mediterranean: in 1905 this disease killed Crowley’s firstdaughter, Lilith, and incapacitated and nearly killed J. F. C. Fuller; at theAbbey, everyone suffered intestinal distress almost constantly. The diagnosiscaused the Lovedays to recall the day they stopped at the spring where Raouldrank the water despite Crowley’s warnings.Raoul’s condition worsened, so on February 16, Beast and Betty went into town tofetch Dr. Maggio. Returning to the Abbey up the mountain path, Betty faintedfrom exhaustion. Crowley knelt and gently revived her. When she was able tostand, he helped her to her feet and announced, “We will make adoration.” Shenodded quietly, and Crowley turned to face the sunset.Hail unto Thee who art Tum in Thy setting, even unto Thee who art Tum in Thyjoy, who travellest over the Heavens in Thy bark at the Down-going of the Sun.Tahuti standeth in His splendour at the prow, and Ra-Hoor abideth at the helm.Hail unto thee from the Abodes of Day!As he spoke the passage from “Liber Resh,” Betty noticed tears streaming downhis cheeks, and she understood the words were also a prayer for Raoul.They marched solemnly back toward the Abbey until Leah met them on the path, asgrim-faced as they. Betty grew concerned. “Is he worse?”Leah answered bluntly. “He’s dead.”Betty fainted again.Raoul had died at 4 o’clock, just as Crowley had predicted. Betty found him inbed, laying with his head canted on his arms, just like the deathly apparitionin their wedding picture. Dr. Maggio ascribed the cause of death to paralysis ofthe heart, and assured everyone that, even if they’d called him when Raoul firstgot sick, he was so weak that the outcome would not have changed.Within an hour of death, Raoul’s body was placed in a coffin; local law requiredthat the body be disposed of within twenty-four hours. So Crowley spent thenight reciting over the clay and rapping with his wand on the side of the box toprepare for his hasty burial. In the morning, Crowley donned his long white silkrobe and the star sapphire ring he had worn in Bou-Sâada with Neuburg. On hisbreast hung a topaz Rosy Cross, and on his head was a cornet inscribed with thename of the northern archangel Uriel. For Crowley, this was the only funeralover which he had ever presided, and the first funeral he had attended since hisfather died back in 1887.A mule-driven cart carried the coffin to the local Catholic cemetery as thelocal monks watched the solemn procession of the Master Therion and hisacolytes. Howard, dressed in a blue silk robe and crowned with a wreath offlowers, ran ahead excitedly. The mourners found him at the cemetery, running incircles and announcing, “We’re going to bury Raoul!” AC, Leah, Ninette, Jane,and Betty, all robed, gathered round the bier. Crowley struck his Tibetan belland conducted a Thelemic service, reciting the “Quia Patris” from his play TheShip; it had always been a poem of great import to Crowley, and he worked itinto many rituals, including the Gnostic Mass and the Paris Working. Today, itwas for Raoul’s funeral:Thou, who art I, beyond all I am,Who hast no nature and no name,Who art, when all but thou are gone,Thou, centre and secret of the Sun …37[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts037]In the end, the words that best summed up the tragedy of Raoul’s premature deathwere from Dr. Faustus: “ ’Tis magic, magic that hath ravished me.”38[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts038]Since Raoul was not a Catholic, he could not be interred in the cemetery;however, a piece of unconsecrated ground outside was made available. TheLovedays would later have their son’s body exhumed and shipped to England.The funeral concluded, Crowley staggered back to the Abbey, exhausted and sick.He collapsed in bed, where he remained for three weeks with a fever of 102degrees. Betty, meanwhile, returned to Palermo and awaited funds from London forher passage home. From Palermo, Betty sent Crowley a friendly note, beginningand ending with the Thelemic salutations, referring to him as “Beast,” andpromising to visit again if possible.39[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts039]“I don’t charge Crowley with causing Raoul’s death,” she would reflect. “Thatwould be silly.”40 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts040] However, bythe time Betty reached London and met reporters at the dock, venom replaced heramity. The Sunday Express paid her £80 for a story, and Betty May gave them agood one. A cat, she said, had wandered into the Abbey and Crowley caught it.During one of his rituals, he instructed Raoul to slit its throat, but theacolyte slipped and sliced its neck without killing it. The cat escaped and ranabout the room, spitting blood everywhere and breaking the protective magiccircle around them. Crowley finally caught and anesthetized the cat, permittingRaoul to finish the job. Leah, meanwhile, caught the blood in a chalice and gaveit to Raoul to drink. He did, and it is from this rite, overseen by Crowley,that her husband died. Although Crowley denied this story, his friend GeraldYorke conceded in later years that the sacrifice had indeed occurred, butemphasized that it was unrelated to Loveday’s cause of death.41[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts041]P. R. Stephensen, who would later become Crowley’s friend and publisher, calledthe stories that filled newspapers for the next two months a campaign ofvilification unparalleled in the history of journalism. It began in the February25, 1923, Sunday Express with a headline splashed across the front page:New Sinister Revelations of Aleister Crowley.Varsity Lad’s Death.Enticed to “Abbey”Deradful Ordeal of a Young Wife.Crowley’s Plans.The article described Raoul, without naming him, as “a boy of twenty-two.” Hiswife—the thrice married, cocaine-addicted pub singer whose bandit friends namedher the “Tiger Woman”—became a naive and defenseless maiden whose idyllicmarriage was destroyed by the manipulations of the depraved Aleister Crowley athis Abbey of iniquity. The abominations published in the Sunday Express, shesaid, only hinted at the real horrors that occurred at the Abbey. Betty’swarning that Crowley planned to sue the Sunday Express for £5,000 over thelibels printed in their attack on The Diary of a Drug Fiend—met withcocksureness:The “Sunday Express” promises Crowley that it intends to pursue itsinvestigations with the utmost ruthlessness, and that next Sunday it willendeavour to supply him with considerable further material on which to base anyaction which he may care to bring.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_071_r1.jpg]An artist’s conception of Betty May’s account of a cat being sacrificed at theAbbey. (photo credit 15.5) [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c15-fig005a]While the Sunday Express followed the article with an interview with Betty Mayon March 4, John Bull commandeered the bandwagon. In the following weeks, itslurid stories featured headlines that would be at home on any tabloid:A Wizard of Wickedness (March 17).The Wickedest Man in the World (March 24).King of Depravity Arrives (April 11).A Man We’d Like to Hang (May 19).The paper claimed Crowley was actually in London and called for his arrest. Itreported that as a mountaineer, Crowley had at one time run low on provisionsand chopped up two of his coolies for food. It called him “one of the mostshameless degenerates who ever boasted of his British birth.”42[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts042] These attacks generated somuch interest that even American newspapers picked up the story of Raoul’sdeath.When the onslaught began, Crowley was still too sick to care. Jane, however,arrived in London on February 28. Seeking legal counsel to sue the SundayExpress, she learned that she could not sue for defamation because the articledid not mention her name. Before long, an undercover reporter from John Bulltracked down this “unscrupulous harpy” and interviewed “the elusive anddangerous Jane Wolfe.” The result was “We Trap the Temptress,”43[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts043] an article disclosing how Janewas seeking new students for the Abbey, along with other equally horribletruths.Among those shocked by the news of Raoul’s death was dramatist and producerLance Sieveking (1896–1972). He had just written his novel The Psychology ofFlying and was in his second year at Cambridge. Like other students, he and hisfriends absorbed themselves in the newspaper accounts, trying to name Crowley’s“nameless rites” and imagine his “unimaginable horrors.” Ultimately, all theymanaged was to revolt each other with images far more twisted than any Crowleyor the press could suggest. Then, around Easter, students and perfect strangersbegan asking him, “I say, do tell me about Aleister Crowley. Is he really as badas they say?” Sieveking denied knowing Crowley, to the disbelief of hisinterrogators. This mystified him until he discovered The Diary of a Drug Fiendcontained the line, “I suppose every one has read The Psychology of Flying by L.de Giberne Sieveking” on page 24. Although the passage explained the connection,he found the remaining text incomprehensible. It would be years before hethought of Crowley again.Raoul’s death robbed Crowley of a friend, student, magical son, and secretary.While there was no replacing him, he still needed a secretary. Thus he summonedNorman Mudd, one of his most devoted and stalwart students.Mudd had changed a great deal since Crowley last saw him on Trinity’s campus in1910. After finishing his master’s degree, Mudd received two job offers, one atthe National Physical Laboratory and another as a professor at Grey UniversityCollege in Bloemfontein, South Africa. He chose the latter, hoping to leave thecountry, forget his college dealings with Crowley, and make a fresh start. Heran the Department of Applied Mathematics from 1911 to 1912, all the whileexperiencing fits of depression. In 1915 he lost an eye due to a gonorrhealinfection. From 1916 to 1917 he ran the Department of Pure Mathematics and wrotea criticism of Einstein’s theory of relativity. He nevertheless remainedunhappy. In 1920, a decade after he last saw AC, Mudd went on sabbatical to seekthe only man who’d ever made him feel he had a purpose in life: AleisterCrowley. Sailing from South Africa, he arrived in Southampton on December 13,1920,44 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts044] and began his quest.Finding the blue Equinox, he traveled to America, arriving aboard the Imperatoron January 18, 1921.45 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts045] Onreaching Detroit, he learned from the Thelemites there that, to hisdisappointment, AC had already returned to England, where Mudd thus returned onFebruary 7, 1921.46 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts046] A letterto his colleague, Leo Marquard, reveals Mudd’s state of mind at this time.Beginning and ending his letter with the standard Thelemic salutations, Muddwrote about the path of initiation:The taking up of this Path is what is referred to variously as the Second Birth,or being Born of the Water of the Spirit, or (by Dante) the Vita Nuova, or (bythe Egyptians) the Entrance on Light, or (by the Buddhists) The Noble AryanPath, or (by the Alchemists) the Great Work, and so on. Also each of thesegroups possesses and communicates to aspirants a body of wisdom and a set ofdisciplines which guide and protect the beginner and prevent his task from beingharder and more dangerous than is, in the nature of the case, unavoidable. Also,it is possible to investigate this Path in a purely scientific manner and topursue the Work without committing oneself to any definite creed orphilosophy.47 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts047]When he finally got hold of Crowley, he received an invitation to Cefalù. Thiscoincided with an invitation to organize the school of astronomy for theUniversity of South Africa. He turned down the job to visit the Abbey.48[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts048]Mudd would become Crowley’s biggest challenge: as an academician, he wasaccustomed to the logical rigors and proofs of mathematics, and refused toengage in any activity or initiation that compromised his objectivity.Nevertheless, he was Christian-reared and caught up in the passion of Crowley’sconvictions, eager to understand and spread the Word of Thelema. He longed todissect The Book of the Law and argue its philosophical and historical elementswith AC. All Crowley wanted was a secretary.Frater Omnia Pro Veritate (All for Truth), as Mudd was known in theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg],arrived the third week of April 1923. At the same time, two of Raoul’s friends,John Pigney and Claud Bosanquet, also came to the Abbey to determine forthemselves the circumstances of their classmate’s death. The pair only stayedlong enough to discover the facts and return home satisfied, if notdisappointed, with the truth.Raymond Greene (1901–1982) also came to Cefalù at this time. An acquaintance ofRaoul’s, Greene and two of his schoolmates had devised a plan for Greene to goto Cefalù, assassinate Crowley, and flee to the south coast, where his friendswould pick him up in a sailboat and take him to Morocco; from there, he wouldreturn home via Spain. Greene, however, doubted the stories about Crowley, andrefused to participate in such a plan. What finally convinced him was a letterthat he received from Crowley just before Easter:Dear Sir,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Forgive me if I suggest, from the little experience that I have in such matters,that when one is establishing a spy system it is rather important to preventone’s principal plan coming directly into the hands of the person whom you wantwatched.Love is the law, love under will.Yours truly,Aleister CrowleyKnight Guardian of the Sangraal49[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts049]Greene visited Italy that Easter, where Crowley met him in Naples to discussdrugs, sex, and libel. “Did Shelley bring libel actions?” AC asked. BeforeGreene could respond, he continued. “No. He came to Italy. Did Byron bring libelactions? No. He came to Italy. Did I bring libel actions?” By this time, Greenewas able to follow the answer in his mind. Crowley received Greene warmly, and avisit to Cefalù left him reporting to Raoul’s mother that Crowley was well-likedin the community, the children seemed clean and healthy, and that he saw nothingsuspicious about Raoul’s death.Then, just as Crowley prepared to get back to business, the Office of theCommisario summoned him. Accompanied by Mudd and Leah, Crowley learned that hehad one week to settle his affairs and leave the country.50[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c15-nts050]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXTEENECCENTRICS IN EXILEPoor and downtrodden, accused of murdering his best friend and favorite pupil,Crowley faced expulsion from his Abbey of Thelema at the Villa Santa Barbara. Apetition signed by local villagers sorry to see Crowley go did nothing to undothe expulsion order. He wrote his will on April 30, leaving his possessions toMudd, then pondered what to do tomorrow, when his deadline came to leave thecountry. Unsure where to go or what to do, he knew only that the Great Work hadto continue. So, on May 1, he consulted the I Ching. It advised that he go toTunis.Leah, convinced that a detective was following them, accompanied Crowley whileNorman, Ninette, and the children stayed behind, maintaining the Abbey untilmatters were rectified. They reached Tunis on May 2, and shortly thereafterended up twenty-five miles northeast in Au Souffle du Zéphyr, the cheapest hotelin La Marsa. Crowley’s journal at this time records:Another bad night: this time because a mouse ran across Leah’s face at 1:15 a.m.She started screaming and became violently hysterical. I copied her asfaithfully as I could.1 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts001]The image of Crowley shrieking hysterically with Leah is both funny and sad.They soon found themselves under a doctor’s care as their health suffered fromstress. Meanwhile, the Sunday Express triumphantly proclaimed:The Beast Told Go:Move by Fascisti against Crowley:Week’s Notice.2 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts002]Back at the Abbey, the remaining Thelemites fared their best. On May 19, at 7:26a.m., Ninette gave birth to la Calce’s daughter; the father contributed nothingto the child’s support and complained when Ninette was unable to pay the rent.“Carlo is a piece of shit,” Leah wrote Ninette in a supportive note. “I wishO.P.V. [Mudd] would tell him so.” Crowley, however, gladly took on the paternalrole. He named the child Isabella Isis Selene Hecate Artemis Diana Hera Jane,although Ninette would come to call her simply Mimi after her twin sister.Casting the child’s horoscope, he observed:Mars, rising above Luna, is rather threatening, but there are no close badaspects either to the Sun or Moon, so probably there is not much to worry about.There is no big complex to make the child distinguished. She is likely todevelop into a fairly ordinary little whore.3[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts003]To the Thelemite who venerated the whore Babalon, this last sentence was notintended as derogatory. As Crowley stressed in closing the letter: “Ever yourswith lots of love, Beast.” Elsewhere, he asked Mudd to “Tell Ninette that I loveher very dearly and enjoyed her letter immensely.”4[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts004]In another letter, Leah tried to keep morale up and family ties tight by adding,“Please tell Miss Lulette that Big Lion and Lala talk about her more than aboutanyone else.” Ninette similarly did her best to keep “Mama Lala” abreast ofdevelopments at the Abbey: Hansi had stripped someone’s tree of green apricots;Isabella had bedbugs in her crib; Lulette asked Beast to bring her back somechocolates; and Howard’s sagacity grew by leaps and bounds. In matters of theGreat Work, she took on Salvatore, their drug connection, as a Probationer.Regarding her own practice of pranayama, Ninette wrote, “I was doing it theother day outdoors whence Hansi came up. Lulette called to him, ‘shh, Hansi!Shummy’s doing polyoner.’ I had to stop and have a beneficial laugh.”5[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts005]Crowley spent the spring writing. After a series of drug experiments in May, hedictated the essay “Ethyl Oxide” to Leah. He also worked on his life story,which he cynically dubbed the Hag, or ‘autohagiography,’ i.e., the autobiographyof a saint. Even at this early stage, Crowley’s vision—projected at 600,000words long—was quite ambitious:The MS though lively is censor proof. It can be represented artfully inprosepctuses as the Confessions of A.C. A great fuss can be made about mailingcopies to subscribers in a plain wrapper and otherwise ensuring their delivery.…There should be no difficulty in selling outright 2000 at $10 a copy. Surplussubscriptions can be absorbed in a second Edition which can be in some waydifferent from the first—either abridged or edited or in some way sufficientlyaltered. During the issuing of the prospectuses the Author will undertake somefeat which will bring him great extra publicity.6[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts006]Work also progressed at this time on a commentary to The Book of the Law.Regarding this comment, Crowley wrote in 1946:Remember always that Commentary was written 25 years ago, and in a peculiarlyexalted state of mind which I can never regain; which is why I never dared touchit. Afraid even to read it!7 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts007]On June 17 he began his commentary on “Liber LXV, or the Book of the Heart Girtwith the Serpent.” Also at this time, he wrote “Eruption of Aetna”:Have not I spoken, even I, Benito,The big, the brave, the mighty Mussolini,The ultra-modern Cæsar, with my ‘VeniVidi, Vici’?—let all the world agree, too!Does a mere mountain think that it is free toStir up sedition? Shall such teeny-weenyVolcanoes venture to display their spleenyAnd socialist cant?—Subside, mosquito!8[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts008]It was the first in a series of anti-Mussolini poems Crowley wrote in responseto his expulsion, published later that year as Songs for Italy.Mudd had come to Tunis as early as June 20 to be closer to Crowley and help withthe Great Work. Unable to afford separate lodgings, they shared a room, givingthem ample time to talk. Mudd was so devoted a student and so dedicated anacademician that he took reams of notes on everything they discussed. Amongthese were Crowley’s plans: he would summon Frank Bennett back to the Abbey, andhe planned to contact Trotsky “to suggest that I be put in charge of aworld-wide campaign to eradicate Christianity”;9[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts009] neither Bennett nor Trotskywould come through.On July 22, Mudd’s mathematician friend joined them. Edmund Hugo Saayman(1897–1971) was born at Orange Free State in southern Africa, attending BoysHigh School in Riversdale and Grey University College in Bloemfontein, where heearned his BS degree.10 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts010] Hearrived in the United Kingdom in October 192111[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts011] as a Rhodes Scholar attendingNew College, Oxford. Here, he was supervised by prominent English mathematicianand number theorist G. H. Hardy (1877–1947).12[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts012] After his summer holiday withMudd, he would return to Oxford to marry Janet Stokes in 1924, receive his BAwith a third class in maths in 1925 and his MA in 1927.13[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts013] As a physics master at HighPavement School, Nottingham, and a part-time lecturer at Leicester UniversityCollege, he would publish several influential papers in physics.14[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts014]A few days later, Crowley moved into the luxurious Tunisia Palace on a LesserMagical Retirement.In July, Crowley’s article on “The Genius of Mr. James Joyce” appeared in TheNew Pearson’s.15 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts015] Frater Achad,meanwhile, was publishing his own books in Chicago: the first, QBL: The Bride’sReception (1923), was a boiled-down Thelemic version of Crowley’s ownkabbalistic essays from The Equinox. Although this was acceptable, his nextbook, Crystal Vision through Crystal Gazing (1923) angered Crowley because ofits unacknowledged extracts from The Vision and the Voice. On April 14, 1923,Jones completed the manuscript for his next book, The Egyptian Revival. In it,he claimed to restore the order of the paths on the Tree of Life by invertingtheir conventional arrangement. After finishing this book, he had a vision thatinspired the pinnacle of his kabbalistic work, The Anatomy of the Body of God.On Achad’s output, Crowley wrote:The books—even apart from the absurd new attribution proposed for the Paths—areso hopelessly bad in almost every way—English, style, sense, point of view, oheverything!—yet they may do good to the people they are written for.16[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts016]August and September became a flurry of activity, Crowley finishing his commenton “Liber LXV”‘ proceeding with the Hag, fuming about Achad’s Egyptian Revival,and wooing Aimée Gouraud. On August 16 he wrote “Tyrol,” another anti-Mussolinipoem. By August 25 he was planning a Golf Course Hotel that would nevermaterialize. When he learned at the end of the month that his South Africanpupil Adam Gray Murray was in town, Crowley summoned him to his side in London.Like Bennett, Murray failed to show.September began on a sour note for Crowley, who wrote in his diary for the 2nd:This a.m. read of the Bombardment of Corfu, killing some dozen or more Armenianchildren—refugees—in revenge for the murder of some Wop fools by some personsunknown some 1,500 miles away! What utter fools—as well as blackguards—statesmenare!Spent all day writing 6 sonnets (& some other verse) on the atrocity.On September 17, Crowley updated the Hag to include a chapter covering the Abbeyand his expulsion.The Thelemites’ situation became even more tumultuous when Norman Mudd realizedhe was in love with Leah. It was, in AC’s opinion, a breakdown in reason anddiscipline, and he responded by devising an Act of Truth by which Mudd couldregain his grip on reality. This “Act of Truth” concept was so important toCrowley’s magick that he would later devote a section to it in his Magickwithout Tears; it is Mudd, however, who gives the best explanation:All initiation must begin with an Act of Truth, a definite commitment whichaffirms and seals the faith of the Aspirant that success in the Great Work is ofa higher value than any other conceivable good.… It is therefore an absoluterule in this work of establishing among men the kingdom of the Aeon ofHeru-Ra-Ha, that every aspirant is required, right at the start, to make acrucial decision, to take an irrevocable step without receiving full informationas to its significance and without security. The clinging to safety in one formor another is the mark of a Slave. To break it quite simply and completely isthe only mode open to the aspirant of asserting the Kingly nature. This is thefirst necessity and the first ordeal is designed to accomplish it.17[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts017]Crowley, Saayman, and Leah witnessed Mudd’s written Act of Truth:Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.I, Omnia Pro Veritate, a Probationer ofA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]hereby call the Lords of Initiation to witness this mine Oath, which I subscribein the presence of The Beast 666, 9°=2°,A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]and of the Scarlet Woman Alostrael 8°=3°,A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg].I call upon them by the Power of the Act of Truth done by me shortly after theWinter Solstice of the Eighteenth Year of the Aeon, when I renounced my careerand my material possessions without reservation, that I might devote my energieswholly to the Great Work, that is, to the Establishment of the Law of Thelema asgiven by Aiwass through The Beast 666 (the man Aleister Crowley) in the Book ofthe Law (Liber Al s[ub] f[igura] XXXI) as in the MS which I have seen, and whichI here declare to command by allegiance, in loyal cooperation with The Beast itsProphet.I hereby acknowledge that most if not all men when in the condition known as‘being in love’ become temporarily unable to use their normal judgment.The Beast and Alostrael have told me that I, being by my own admission ‘in love’with Alostrael, have become, and am now unable to reason correctly, and todevote my energies to the Great Work.The Beast furthermore officially lays it upon me as a Probationer ofA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]to take this present Oath, by virtue of the clause in my Obligation pertinent tothe matter.Albeit unable to admit the justice of their view, I am resolved to adhere to theletter of my Oath, and to trust their statement that I am at present incapableof deciding rightly for myself in this matter.I hereby solemnly pledge myself to extirpate once and for all the consciousnessof the tendency to perceive the sensation of my being ‘in love’ with Alostrael.And I conjure the Lords of Initiation by the Password of the present Equinox,the Word [IHI AUD] that this Oath be of power to establish in me the MagicalLight and to make me wholly master of my animal and emotional impulses.Wherein if I fail, may the light of my body be darkened, and the virtue ofmanhood abide no more with me.Love is the law, love under will.18[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts018]Mudd signed the form, and the witnesses endorsed it. While Crowley hadoriginally planned to send Mudd away on a soul-searching retirement, he notedimprovement in Mudd’s disposition later that same day: “I am much less anxiousas to the issue than I was when I wrote the Act of Truth for him.”19[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts019] Mudd nevertheless decided totake eight days to meditate and learn by example from Crowley’s autobiography.“Well,” Mudd, with downcast eyes, said to Leah, “goodbye. Look after yourselfand the Beast, won’t you?”She nodded. “Love is the law …”“Love under will.”Leah clenched Mudd tightly, pressed her lips against his, and said, “I loveyou.” She repeated it twice.Mudd was a wretchedly frozen clod, feeling more awkward and unattractive thanever. Deep inside, his soul cried out, You’re a damned good comrade, and that’sall that matters. But tongue-tied, he only repeated himself lamely like a stuckrecord. “Love under will.”“You will come back to us, won’t you, and work together again?”He hoped so, but was unsure. “Well, anyhow, we will work.” With that, he left.20[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts020] Contemplating his love forLeah, his oath to forget her, and their parting words that could have been somuch more, he wept. Rather than clear his mind of the Scarlet Woman, it made himlove her more than ever.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_072_r1.jpg]Portrait of Norman Mudd by Aleister Crowley. (photo credit 16.1)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c16-fig001a]Applying logic to the problem, he produced a solution: The Book of the Law,their moral guidebook, demanded that the Scarlet Woman be loud and adulterous.This meant Leah had to be married: not to Beast, her lover, but to Mudd. Thus,having sex with Beast would make her an adulteress. Crowley, of course, rejectedthe idea, responding, “Adultery does not imply marriage, no more than whoredomimplies commerce.”21 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts021]By the end of October, Mudd’s fixation moved from Leah to The Book of the Law,and he and Beast corresponded freely on the subject. He viewed AC’s role asBeast logically, asking what he should have done upon receiving the book. Whatwere its instructions? How were the tenets of Thelema to be disseminated? Muddbelieved The Book of the Law was never intended for the masses, Aiwass callingit the law of princes and kings: “Therefore the kings of the earth shall beKings for ever: the slaves shall serve.”22[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts022] Thus, Crowley had erred inpublishing The Book of the Law, Mudd telling him, “You have assumed that youwere free to ‘broadcast’ CCXX [The Book of the Law] even to force it on theattention of the General Public.”23[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts023] Crowley’s real task, Muddbelieved, was to put The Book of the Law into the hands of politicians, to trainworld leaders in Thelema and magick, and to amass the wealth necessary to putover the Great Work. Furthermore, Mudd noted that after nearly twenty years,many explicit instructions in the text had not been carried out: writing thecomment, abstructing the Stele, and selecting an island. Thus, Crowley had soseriously fumbled The Book of the Law’s clear instructions that the SecretChiefs were now punishing him with misfortune.Although Crowley seriously considered Mudd’s observations, agreeing with mostand encouraging further comment, he disagreed on several points. According toThe Book of the Law, for instance, anyone could be a king. It referred to one’sspiritual, not political, nobility. In order to control Mudd’s excited exegeses,Crowley recorded, “I should warn Fra[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]O.P.V. once and for all that he is dangerously excited mentally and will becomedefinitely insane (legally speaking) unless he can control and slow down hischittam [Sanskrit, mind, mental activities].”24[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts024] During this contentiousexchange, Crowley penned what has become known as the “Short Comment”:The study of this Book is forbidden. It is wise to destroy this copy after thefirst reading.Whosoever disregards this does so at his own risk and peril. These are mostdire.Those who discuss the contents of this Book are to be shunned by all, as centresof pestilence.All questions of the Law are to be decided only by appeal to my writings, eachfor himself.There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt.Crowley ascribed so much importance to this brief text that he included it insubsequent editions of The Book of the Law. Regardless of whether one interpretsit as a tool of convenience or an inspired text, it silenced Mudd.25[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts025]In late October, AC and Leah hired a boy named Mohammed and drove to Nefta,where they rented a camel and set off into the desert. They were on a magicalretirement, seeking new inspiration or direction. They walked at night and sleptthrough the day, planning on a month of it. However, all three took ill andreturned to a Nefta hotel. Waiting for them they found Mudd, who had pawned thering Crowley had given him in order to get to Tunis.Setbacks aside, the trip proved valuable. While staying at the Hotel du Djerid,Crowley wrote the Djeridensis Comment, or Commentary D, to The Book of the Law;it was one of his major analyses of the text. Meanwhile, Leah experienced aseries of visions that Crowley believed demonstrated direct communication withthe Secret Chiefs. Her first vision began at 10:30 p.m. after taking laudanum.Without prompting from Crowley, she saw a street lined with houses, and thegeomantic symbol Via (the way or path) appeared in a white cresence. Crowleyreached for his ephemeris, noting the moon’s rising in Cancer. Via, he recalled,corresponded to water, Cancer, and the moon. The day, Monday, was even named forthe moon. “Repeat Gayatri26 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts026]while I write this up,” he instructed, and reached for his diary to scribblethese observations.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_073_r1.jpg]Aleister Crowley in Tunisia, 1923. (photo credit 16.2)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c16-fig002a]“Okay, shoot!” he prompted when ready, and she continued to describe a horsemanwearing jeweled armor and riding a white steed. Crowley equated him with theKnight of Cups, one of the watery tarot cards. Next, she saw two turtles drawinga boat, which reminded her of Lohengrin. Invoking the moon, she saw a womanhidden behind a lyre and fountain. The fountain, Crowley noted, represented theTwo of Cups—the aspect of Venus in Cancer—but the woman’s countenance was toobright to describe. When he asked, “What is her name?” the woman opened herhand—actually a bird’s claw—and dropped a crystal ball. Although unspoken, theword implied by her was NiLZA. Using the Hebrew Nun, English i, Latin L, ArabicZ, and Greek A, Crowley tallied the word to ninety, for the watery Queen of Cupstarot card.Leah finally vibrated the magical word Thelema to get a clearer image, but theimage went up in sparks and flame like a sun. Unintelligible images flooded hervision until she insisted, “I want to hear, not see!” Into her mind popped theresponse from Liber AL ii.9, “but there is that which remains.” She descended avalley into an elaborate chapel wherein a peacock, a symbol of the Knight ofCups, was worshiped. Its name was PIRA. Crowley tallied the name to 291(denoting a torrent of water, and the Angel of Aquarius, the water bearer).Leah, who was quick on her feet at gematria, suggested the spelling APIRA, whichyielded 292, a number of the moon.Finally, Leah encountered a white man, cast in blue light, and knew she hadreached the ruler of this vision. “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of theLaw,” she greeted. He responded by slaying Pira with a dorge, and the templeburst into an uproar. His name, in Greek, was FAB, and his number, 503, was thatof the chalice; appropriate since the chapel reminded Leah of the Sangraal.After he proved his knowledge and attainment, Crowley instructed her, “Enoughfor now. Return.”Planted firmly in this reality, Leah and Crowley analyzed the recurrent wateryimages of her vision, in harmony with the planetary position of the Moon (itselfa symbol of water) in the aqueous sign of Cancer the crab. As they spoke, theclouds opened and dumped torrents of rain on Nefta.The visions continued, but they desperately needed financial and spiritualsupport. Crowley instructed Mudd to send a summons to all his students:Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.These letters: to summon the______________________Aspirant to present himself inperson without delay or excuse before my Acting Chancellor Frater Omnia ProVeritate Prof. Norman Mudd, M.A. Camb. from him to receive my furtherInstructions as to his Training as a Kingly Man that he may discover and do hisTrue Will and fulfill his proper function in the Aeon of Heru-Ra-Ha.Witness my hand: TO MEGA THERION 666 9°=2°A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]LOGOS AIONOS THELEMA 9327 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts027]Alas, the summons scared off everyone but Windram’s student Adam Gray Murray. Hearrived at the Abbey on November 20 with a donation of two hundred lire.“Hip-hip-hoorah,” lonely Ninette wrote excitedly to Mudd. “Murray has arrivedfrom South Africa. He is a dear. He meets all requirements for being the mostenjoyable companion I could wish for. I hope he remains right here with me andyou never get a glimpse of him.”28[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts028]Meanwhile, Crowley described his financial dilemma to American book collectorand patron of the arts Montgomery Evans II (1901–1954):I have been living literally from hand to mouth for I don’t know how long. Thisfact is well known to my enemies who do not scruple to attack my honour and myproperty in every base way, knowing that I cannot take the proper legal action.If we had a business partner with a few thousand dollars, I and my secretarycould put everything on a sound basis very quickly, and incidentally vindicatemy reputation against the creatures who have been vile enough to publish allsorts of idiotic falsehoods about me.29[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts029]Thus the Thelemites, congregating at the end of 1923, parted ways in an attemptto salvage their life’s work.Crowley sailed to Marseilles, where he stayed at the Hotel de Blois and, onJanuary 2, 1924, met Frank Harris—the business partner alluded to above—forlunch in Nice. Harris was happy to see Crowley, and together they planned topurchase the Paris Evening Telegram. Both saw it as a handy means to a profit,and Crowley hoped that owning his own press would empower him to clear his name.Alas, neither one could amass their half of the necessary capital.When Leah recovered from another illness and arrived in Cefalù, she finally metMimi, who was now “shamelessly fat.”30[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts030] Another new, but slightlyolder, resident of the Abbey was Arturo Sabatini, a poor boy who hated his homeand hung around at the Abbey, hoping to join them. His eyes were damaged duringthe war, and he had spent his pension of two hundred lire a month to buy sweetwine and cigarettes for Ninette. He was pleasing company, and when she waslonely, Ninette would let him stay the night. Leah soon began instructing him,while Ninette practiced sex magick with him.Finally, there was Murray, the Abbey’s newest arrival and oldest member. Hisattitudes clashed with Leah’s, prompting him to say, “She said she was divinelyappointed by the Gods to teach me, but a woman cannot teach a man.” At longlast, however, Leah felt optimistic, glad to be back at Cefalù:There is no ‘back home.’ Though I had furniture, cut-glass, a salary, and a verygood housekeeper in the form of my mother, I never knew about home till I camehere. I have no personal possessions here—not even a lock on my door—and allsorts of people blow in and stay a while, people with whom I seem to havenothing in common—no privacy in the ordinary sense of the word—yet I am free asa bird and not a libertine! …Even if I had been deserted, neglected, abused, doped, etc. ad infinitum, inthis awful ‘Hell Hole of Devil Worshippers’ I should have started a pennantstand in Paris rather than to have gone back to my raised (?) salary as a musicsupervisor!31 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts031]Mudd remained in Tunis, trying unsuccessfully to raise money for passage toLondon, where he hoped to resolve the problem with Chiswick Press’s stock ofCrowley books and to publish “positive truth” in response to the Sunday Expresslibels. Feeling hopeless about his situation, he found a stamped postcard andwrote to Crowley, “Beloved Father, I haven’t eaten in thirty-six hours, and I amcompletely indifferent whether I eat again.” Crowley reported he was “in bedwith a bitch,” causing Mudd to shudder at the irony of his unrequited love forLeah. Faced with overwhelming monetary problems, his crusade in England to clearCrowley’s name went on indefinite hold.Crowley was but one of several mystics drawn to the sylvan glades of his belovedFontainebleau, including influential Greek-Armenian mystic George IvanovichGurdjieff (c. 1866–1949) and his disciple Pyotr Demianovich Ouspensky(1878–1947). Gurdjieff called his teachings the Fourth Way, developing the body,mind, and emotions in tandem in order to achieve spiritual awakening. Believinggroup work superior to solitary work, he established Schools of the Fourth Way,founding the Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man at the Château LePrieuré in Fontainebleau-Avon in October 1922. After Katherine Mansfield died oftuberculosis during a visit there, Gurdjieff was unfairly called “the man whokilled Katherine Mansfield,”32 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts032]thus giving him something in common with Crowley’s own tragedy with Loveday.Crowley called on Gurdjieff on February 10, 1924, but the master was out; so hesettled for a stimulating dinner with his right-hand man, former BritishIntelligence officer Major Frank Pinder. Crowley considered Pinder “a hell of afine fellow” and recorded the visit in his diary:Gurdjieff, their prophet, seems a tip-top man. Heard more sense and insight thanI’ve done for years. Pinder dines at 7:30. Oracle for my visit was “There arefew men: there are enough.” Later, a really wonderful evening with Pinder.Gurdjieff clearly a very advanced adept. My chief quarrels are over sex (I doubtwhether Pinder understands G’s true position) and their punishments, e.g.,depriving the offender of a meal or making him stand half an hour with his armsout. Childish and morally valueless.33[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts033]Years later, Crowley would meet Gurdjieff disciple C. Stanley Nott (1887–1978)and, through this connection, come to meet the mystic. In his account, Nottreported that Crowley arrived and told the boys stories of how he was teachinghis own son to be a devil, while Gurdjieff kept a close eye on him.34[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts034] In Yorke’s version, “theysniffed around one another like dogs.”35[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts035] A more colorful conclusion isrelayed by Webb: as Crowley prepared to leave that Sunday evening, Gurdjieffascended the staircase to the second floor halfway, turned, and asked, “Mister,now you go?” The Beast, heading toward the door, stopped, faced him, and repliedthat he was, in fact, leaving. “You have been a guest? And now you are no longerguest?” Crowley agreed with both statements. Gurdjieff, released from theconstraints of hospitality, grew red with the rage he had kept pent inside theentire weekend. “You filthy!” he spat. “You dirty inside! Never again you setfoot in my house.” Gurdjieff’s histrionic tirade rambled on as a puzzled Crowleycontinued on his way.36 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts036] Noneof Crowley’s diaries or letters, however, mention this incident; neither doGurdjieff’s.Separation proved hard on Crowley’s extended family. Ninette and Beast missedeach other, prompting the second concubine to write, “My well-loved Beast, 93. Iwrite to you tonight because I feel I must tell you I love you and long to bewith you.”37 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts037] Meanwhile, hisdaughter wrote separately:Dear Beast,My first tooth has come out. I am sending it to you. It is Lulette who iswriting it. Thank you for my box of candies.Beast, I love you. Soon I will come to you. Love to you, A.Lulu P.38 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts038]Although he had taken the oath of an Ipsissimus two years earlier (on May 23,1921), Crowley’s final initiation into the ultimate grade of theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]did not begin until the winter solstice (December 21, 1923); it climaxed inFebruary 1924 and concluded that March. A fox, an Eastern symbol of wisdom,served as his spirit familiar in this initiation; on February 21, it escortedCrowley into the upper realms of Air, through unimaginably huge caverns of ice,and into the lowest Spheres of Fire. As he recorded:At one period it was necessary for me to ascend from the most tenuous regions ofpure air through a series of vast caverns so devised that nothing human couldpossibly pass through them into the regions of pure fire. To accomplish this itwas necessary that I should be exhausted physically to the utmost pointcompatible with continued life.39[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts039]While he left few details on the nature of his ordeal, his letters show thatCrowley was sick from nervous prostration and recovering from two operations. Hewas so ill that, back at the Abbey, Ninette and Arturo performed a sex magickritual to hasten his recovery. He was also having dark moments of self-doubt. Atone point, he asked Mudd, “Have I ever done anything of any value, or am I amere trifler, existing by a series of shifts of one kind or another. A wastrel,a coward, man of straw?” Amused by the question, Mudd answered by quoting TheBook of the Law—“thou hast no right but to do thy will. Do that, and no othershall say nay”—to which Crowley responded, “You have probably saved my life.”40[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts040] At this time, he also ponderedhis continuing drug use. “Was the whole of my trouble really due to withdrawalof heroin, and my rapid recovery to cautious restocking?”41[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts041] Recognizing that he requiredthe drug medically because of his asthma, he conceded there was also apsychosomatic component to his condition. “My general conclusion on this part ofthe problem is that drugs are fundamentally useless—and treacherous, the Lordknows! They are just Emergency Rations.… the Asthmatic is in fact a MaladeImaginaire [imaginary invalid] in a certain sense.”42[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts042]Regardless, Crowley described his initiation:At this time he lay sick unto death. He was entirely alone; for They [i.e. theSecret Chiefs] would not even permit the presence of those few whom They hadthemselves appointed to aid him in this final initiation [Leah, Ninette, Mudd].In this last ordeal the earthly part of him was dissolved in water; the waterwas vaporized into air; the air was rarefied utterly, until he was free to makethe last effort, and to pass into the vast caverns of the Threshold which guardsthe Realm of Fire. Now naught human may come through those immensities. So inthat Fire he was consumed wholly, and as pure Spirit alone did he return, littleby little, during the months that followed, into the body and mind that hadperished in that great ordeal of which he can say no more than: I died.43[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts043]While the manner in which he was rarefied and destroyed by each of the fourelements is indescribable, Crowley recorded its result in his diary:I am beginning to realize faintly of how many and gross deceits I have beencleansed in my ascent into the Sphere of Fire. In particular, the ‘invincibleLove’ which Frater O.P.V. discovered in me is now quite ‘unassuaged of purpose’and ‘delivered from the lust of result’ flowing forth freely ‘under will’ as itshould; now therefore on its waters there shall bloom deathless the Lotus ofPurity whereupon Hoor-paar-kraat may stand and glow with Silence.…Now am I wholly entered within the Sphere of Fire, the Empyrean; and no othershall say nay.It has been a terrible ordeal.44[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts044]But Crowley, in his estimation, survived to become his very own self, theIpsissimus, looking on the world from the Crown of the Tree of Life.When Leah and Norman went to attend to their ailing master, she was nervousabout meeting Crowley. If his initiation was genuine, the man she loved was nomore: as a Magus, he had been the logos, the word Thelema, incorporated in humanform as the Beast. As an Ipsissimus, he was now a being of pure spirit, and shewas unsure how to approach him. Back in Cefalù, she had done a ritual to prepareherself for this meeting. As she described the rite, “All thoughts fled leavingme with, ‘My whole being calls out to you to see us thro’ this crisis.’ I usedthis as my opening speech and then the ideas flowed.”45[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts045] Gone were her fears of direconsequences for failing the Great Work; gone were her feelings of inferiority,for she was, after all, the Scarlet Woman. For the first time in ages, Leah feltconfident and happy.However, she also brought news that they risked losing the Abbey unless theypaid the rent. Thus Crowley called in debts and friendships, even going so faras to contact George Cecil Jones’s representative about obtaining an advanceagainst future payments of the trust fund from his mother’s death. Meanwhile,Leah wrote instructions for Frank Bennett to cable whatever money he had savedfor his voyage to the Abbey per Crowley’s earlier summons.Meanwhile, Crowley, in his mission to rehabilitate his name, wrote An OpenLetter to Lord Beaverbrook. It was the desperate gesture of a man who was nowtoo impecunious to travel to London, let alone hire a solicitor. As he remarkedbitterly to Holman Hunt—who worked for Crowley’s solicitors Parker, Garrett &Co46 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts046]—“The Sunday Express madesure that I was penniless before printing its lies.”47[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts047] He sent Mudd to take the essayto the Sunday Express and circulate it to London’s literati. Although Mudd waspoor and dressed in rags, Crowley felt the apparent ruin of a good man by theSunday Express would only help their case. Mudd soon wound up living in Chelsea.His room at 27 Redburn Street was uncomfortable, “a poor sort of affair.”48[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts048] He was working with JaneWolfe, who’d been in London since March 1923, and for a time became her lover.When Murray joined them, they sold their clothes to raise money for food andrent.With money coming in from various sources and the I Ching promising a greatchange, Crowley and Leah anticipated the end of April. Over the years, May wasalways a big month: they conceived Poupée in 1919; Crowley’s unborn son wasconceived a year later; in 1921, Crowley took his Ipsissimus oath; Collinscontracted The Diary of a Drug Fiend in 1922; and in 1923, Italy expelledCrowley. Just as things were looking up, they received a notice of eviction from50 rue Vavin.Although in the past Bourcier had allowed Crowley to stay at 50 rue Vavin oncredit, he had sold the establishment. The new owner honored no sucharrangement; on May 1, he ejected Crowley and Leah from the hotel and kept theirluggage in lieu of payment. Crowley angrily cursed the hotel for interferingwith the Great Work. Holed up at 6 rue Jolia, they spoke to police and lawyersfor several days. By May 8, they had retrieved most of their luggage, and thecursed hotel at 50 rue Vavin soon went bankrupt.Soon afterward, Crowley met Argentinian artist Xul Solar (1887–1963). OscarAgustín Alejandro Schulz Solari was a painter, poet, and visionary known forweaving mystical elements from kabbalah, astrology, tarot, I Ching, and Crowleyinto his works. His close friend, Argentinian writer Jorgé Luis Borges, calledhim “our William Blake.”49 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts049]Having spent the last dozen years studying modernist art in Europe, Solar wasstill early in his career when he arrived in Paris on April 29, 1924, to exhibitthree pieces at the Musée Galliera as part of a show organized by La Maison del’Amérique Latine and the Académie Internationale des Beaux-Arts. He also usedthis opportunity to track down Crowley, whom he had been seeking as a teacherfor some time. Solar found him in Chelles on May 14, and the following dayCrowley accepted him as a student, noting in his diary, “Xul Solar Signed Oathin Silence Diary.”50 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts050] Playingchess with AC later that evening, Solar remarked that “his True Will is to unifySouth America on Spiritual lines.”51[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts051] Solar had read The Equinox andtranslated Book Four, so Crowley had high hopes that he would producetranslations of the Holy Books and help to establish OTO in Argentina. Havingtested his astral visions and liked what he saw, AC tasked his new student withrecording astral visions for each of the sixty-four I Ching hexagrams. In aletter to Solar five years later, Crowley reminded him, “By the way, you owe mea complete set of visions for the 64 Yi symbols. Your record as the best seer Iever tested still stands today, and I should like to have a set of visions as amodel.”52 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts052] Solar eventually didproduce these visions as San Signos (Holy Signs), written in his inventedlanguage of Neo-criollo; only a few of these visions have ever been published.Solar returned to Buenos Aires shortly after meeting Crowley, becoming prominentamong the South American avant garde in the 1920s.53[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts053]Early that June, when Crowley apprised Frank Harris of his plans with the OpenLetter, Harris advised Crowley to hire a good solicitor. If he agreed to splitthe profit with his counsel, Harris claimed, Crowley could sue Lord Beaverbrookfor libel and receive $20,000 in damages. More than ever, AC felt the need toretaliate.He hired Herbert Clarke of rue St. Honoré to print three thousand copies of thefifteen-page An Open Letter to Lord Beaverbrook, a document that called for fullpublic investigation of the outrageous attack on one of England’s most prolificcontemporary poets. With Jane’s help, Mudd sent copies with cover letters tofriends and important people, including members of the House of Lords, ScotlandYard, the British press, George Bernard Shaw, Arnold Bennett, writer Miguel deUnamuno (1864–1936), and anarchist Emma Goldman (1869–1940). In his naiveenthusiasm, Mudd even asked the Bureau of Investigation for a letter ofrecommendation for Crowley’s espionage work during the Great War; the U.S.government, of course, sent no such document.54[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts054]Responses to the Open Letter were mixed. Augustus John promised his support, andphilosopher Bertrand Russell wrote:I received your letter and one from Dr. Crowley. The latter seems to show thathe is in a position to establish the falsehood of the libel … If you can put anywide-read newspaper to print a letter … asserting that the Sunday Express liedon this occasion, it would bring an action against the editor of the newspaperin question. Probably this is strategically the best way to goad the SundayExpress into action. For this purpose, you must find the right editor … I knownothing about Dr. Crowley, but should be glad to see the Beaverbrook press shownup.Bernard Shaw, knowing nothing of the matter, would not support Crowley. “Ireplied that no such proposition was ever made,” AC wrote. “He was asked tofight for the decency of public controversy.” Emma Goldman wrote helplessly:I regret I am too poor to be a help to anybody just now. Neither can I lend myname as support to any undertaking until I myself am on my feet.Similarly, Philip Heseltine (a.k.a. Peter Warlock, 1894–1930) wrote to Mudd, “Iam very sorry to hear that Crowley is at present in such straitenedcircumstances. I very much regret that, financially at any rate, I can donothing to help him, being in perhaps as bad a case myself.” Even those withmoney proved unsupportive. Otto Kahn, for instance, responded simply: “I regretto learn of the situation which Mr. Crowley describes, but as I leave for NewYork tomorrow morning, I am sorry that it will be impossible for me to see youduring my present stay in Europe.” Austin Harrison simply dismissed Crowley as a“moral wreck from the abuse of heroin.” Most discouraging was the reply Muddreceived from his father:Your letter and enclosure reached us last evening and both mother and I aredeeply concerned and very despondent about the whole affair. We hope you arequite sure of your facts, for the events referred to seem to relate to theperiod of your absence from this country when you were thousands of miles awayfrom your hero and therefore not fully cognizant of his doings. If you arerelying mainly on his word, I am afraid you are trusting on a very broken reed.You know we never liked him and have not the slightest sympathy with his cause.We have always looked on him as your evil genius right from your Cambridge days,and are terribly afraid that he will blight your whole life.55[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts055]In the end, the lukewarm response to the letter and Mudd’s own poverty renderedimpotent this plan to salvage Crowley’s name. It was the beginning of thecollapse of everything the Thelemites held dear.Back at Cefalù, Ninette’s sex magick with Arturo resulted in her pregnancy.Announcing it to Leah, she wrote, “I am the prospective mother of a kickinghealthy bastard, who should show its sex barring accident during the month ofMarch. I hope this will be a painful shock to no one, in spite of the warning Ireceived once of not to indulge in my natural pastime; I promise to let up a bitafter this one.”56 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts056]Meanwhile, fearing the Baron would make good on his threats to evict theThelemites from the Abbey, she and Murray pawned the Abbey’s furniture. Theyplaced Crowley’s books, manuscripts, paintings, and diaries in the care of aPalermo gentleman named Aguel, who began shipping them to Mudd via the AmericanExpress Company. After the first box reached London safely, Mudd eagerlyrequested shipment of the remaining dozen cases, postage due. These Aguel sentaboard the SS Suein Jarl. Alas, His Majesty’s Customs inspected the cases andfound some questionable Crowley pieces, including the patently obscene “LeahSublime,” his “A Book of Photographs,” and thirty-three copies of the homosexualBagh-i-Muattar. On July 8, Customs sent Mudd a “Notice of seizure of goodsprohibited to be imported under Section 42 of the Customs Consolidation Act1876.” They confiscated all twelve boxes. Mudd received the bad news on July 17and went into a panic: what would Beast do when he found out? On July 24, hisnerves frazzled, Mudd took a rest cure from the Great Work.When Crowley finally found out, he noted with displeasure, “Some lunaticdirectly inspired by the High Gods sent all my private papers and books toEngland! The Customs House has had a continuous spasm of Priapism ever since.”57[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts057] Writing to Inspector Draper ofScotland Yard, he claimed his research was clinical, intended for mentalpathologists. Customs disagreed. When Leah headed for London to help, sheexperienced considerable difficulty:I was refused entrance to England (though I was already seated in the train forLondon, having passed Customs and Immigrations inspections) for a rat-facedperson stage-whispered “Aleister Crowley” to a tall sandy Immigration clerk whoasked me to descend myself and accompany him. Not finding A.C. or even C. on myperson or in my baggage they announced after 3 hours or more … that they hadreceived telephone orders to send me back.58[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts058]In the end—March 1926—Customs would destroy the crates containing Crowley’sconfiscated Cefalù diaries, manuscripts, and rare books. This at least is whathas been reported in a number of sources. However, the story does not end there.Two years hence Crowley would write to his new disciple, Gerald Yorke, “Thetrouble about the Cefalù diaries—and all other MSS—is that any day now there maybe nothing to edit! … There are 3 cases still unopened and 10 or 11 more stillto come from Italy.” And, three weeks thereafter, he would write to this samepupil, “The cases have come (from Italy).” Finally, on Christmas Day of 1928, hewrote to Yorke,My marginal note was not intended to affirm that any given manuscripts have notbeen seized. It is in fact probable that duplicates of these diaries were in thecases, but I don’t care in the least about this. What I meant by my note wasthat these particular manuscripts had not been destroyed.… I am delighted withyour report about the Customs. It is deliciously characteristic that they shouldpreserve just those portions which they suppose to be obscene, and destroy therest. What other portion would they understand?59[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts059]While an early shipment of Crowley’s material was seized and destroyed in 1925,it appears a substantial amount survived.Leah returned to Crowley in Paris after her abortive London trip, and Mudd andMurray soon joined the ailing couple. Finances forced them all to share a roomat the Hotel du Maine, with Murray sleeping on the floor. “We are in desperatestraits,” Leah reported to Montgomery Evans.60[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts060] A day later, Crowleycollapsed. “My legs assumed independent control of the situation,” he noted. “Ihad a very amusing time watching them try to kick the bedstand to pieces.”61[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts061] Poverty had placed Crowley ina state of involuntary heroin withdrawal, breaking the habit that his Willmerely curtailed.Mudd and Murray fared no better on their return to London: they often wenthungry, and Jane was evicted for not paying her rent. In order to get by, Murraysoon began pocketingA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]donations sent from American disciples Frater Achad and Max Schneider (of whommore will follow).One last crisis completed the tragedy: after Leah’s sister Alma visited her andher eccentric lover that August, she proceeded to Cefalù, planning to take Hansiinto her custody. Alma Hirsig Bliss (b. 1875) was an artist specializing inminiatures. Loving art from a young age, she attended the Peter-Cooper Instituteand spent a year at the Art League. While studying in Paris, she discovered hermedium—miniatures—for which she became well known.62[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts062] Examples of her works are keptat the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Smithsonian American ArtMuseum.63 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts063] Sometime after 1920she married New Yorker Louis E. Bliss, who died shortly thereafter in June1923.64 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts064] In July 1924 shesailed aboard the SS Minnekahda, arriving in Plymouth, England, on the 12th,65[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts065] proceeding from there to visither sister and the Abbey.Forewarned, Crowley instructed Ninette, “Should Alma come to Cefalù, she is notto be admitted to the Abbey, or allowed to talk to the children. Don’t parleywith her: throw her out quick!” Alma arrived the same day as the letter, butNinette nevertheless let Alma in. By September 13 she had snuck off with Hansi.She returned to New York via Southampton, arriving with Hansi in October;66[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts066] the next year, an illustratedfeature on Alma pictured “her adopted child” beside one of him “as he appearedwhen his home was in Italy.”67 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts067]Seeing himself surrounded by misfortune, Crowley, much to Leah’s displeasure,sought a fresh magical current in Dorothy Olsen, a thirty-two-year-old Americanwho had joined theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]that summer in Chelles. Born in Chicago on September 6, 1892, she’d beensummering in France, Belgium, England, Spain, Norway, and Italy the last fewyears.68 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts068] When Beast announcedthat the Secret Chiefs were sending him and “Soror Astrid,” his new ScarletWoman, on a magical retirement in Tunis—possibly for several months—Leahcollapsed. Reluctant to surrender the rank of Scarlet Woman yet powerless toprevent the retirement, Leah convinced herself that she was Babalon incarnateand that Dorothy was her magical child. Two days before the autumnal equinox,Leah entered on one of the scraps of paper that constituted her diary at thistime, “I hereby renounce the title the Scarlet Woman and pass it on to the‘scarlet Concubine of his Desire,’ the daughter of Babalon.”69[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts069] Together, they received theequinoctial password “Om.”[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_074_r1.jpg]Dorothy Olsen (b. 1892). (photo credit 16.3)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c16-fig003a]That day, Crowley and Dorothy sailed for the Majestic Hotel, Tunis. There theybegan “a magical operation of the very highest class”70[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts070] in which Crowley wrote “ToMan,” otherwise known as “The Mediterranean Manifesto”:TO MANDo what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.My Term of Office upon the Earth being come in the year of the foundation of theTheosophical Society, I took upon myself, in my turn, the sin of the wholeWorld, that the Prophecies might be fulfilled, so that Mankind may take the NextStep from the Magical Formula of Osiris to that of Horus.And mine Hour being now upon me, I proclaim my Law.The Word of the Law is [images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L12_r1.jpg].

She had given up her crown asScarlet Woman. She was sick, and, furthermore, she was sick of being sick. As aThelemite, she not only awaited death but felt it was her Will to die. LikePoupée, she had finished her job and desired to move on.On September 24, she wrote her will, leaving her possessions to Mudd, with a fewexceptions: to Jane, the bravest woman she knew, Leah left her blue cape; toNinette, she left custody of Hansi; and her little red purse went to Lulette.She also left instructions for Mudd “to prosecute the swine who are responsiblefor my death,” namely Lord Beaverbrook, Alma Bliss, and H. Roy (the latestlandlord to seize Crowley’s things for nonpayment of rent). The next day shetelegrammed news of her impending death to her good friend Aimée Gouraud, whorushed to her side with food and reassurances. Despite her despair, Leahstressed, particularly to Aimée, that she did not blame Crowley:Understand that you are not to think that A.C. deserted me. He did not. Heliberated me. I die, not as you imagine through neglect by him but in service tothe Work which we united to do. He and I are One, nay are None.When you see him you will understand.71[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts071]On September 26, still convinced she was dying, Leah wrote a tender au revoir tothe man to whom she was hopelessly devoted:My beloved Beast,93.I am going to die tonight. There is very little I can say for now that theconspiracy of Silence is at an end, your monkey takes on the silence.I have always loved you, as you have me. That is why you have never failed me asI have never failed you. We have both misunderstood often but we always foundthat misunderstanding did not matter for it lead to understanding in our case,always at the right time. Only gods know what time means.You will not grieve over my death. You will rejoice, God that you are. Rememberthat Alostrael, Babalon … the Scarlet Woman, lives forever. Leah Hirsig died butthen I never knew her …I am yours, you are mine93 93/93Babalon72 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts072]Her only regret was that the Beast was so far away while she was on her deathbed. On September 28, she wrote in her diary:I should have liked, as a human creature, to have died in the arms of The Beast666, who, as will be noted in my very first diary (commencing Mar 21, 1919) wasand is my lover, my mate, my father, my child and everything else that Womanneeds in Man.73 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts073]Unable to pay rent, she lost her room, wandering rain-drenched Paris and finallycollapsing in the hallway of her hotel as onlookers speculated whether she wasill or merely drugged; a jeering crowd gathered until the police arrived.Death was all that remained for her. She felt she had fulfilled the prophecy ofThe Book of the Law, which warned that the Scarlet Woman would be “cast out frommen: as a shrinking and despised harlot shall she crawl through dusk wetstreets, and die cold and an-hungered.”74[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts074] She hoped to die on a Mondaybecause in that same scripture, it is written “he is ever a sun, and she amoon.”75 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts075] When Monday,September 29, came, she did not die; however, a telegram from Ninette devastatedher with news that Alma Bliss, with help from the American consul in Palermo,had fled to America with Hansi. “Alma Bliss,” Leah complained, “has communicatedwith both the governess and myself as though she had done a wonderful deed. Sheis quite crazy.”76 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts076]The next day, Mudd, having given up in his campaign with the Open Letter, joinedher in Paris. Good old Mudd, she thought: he’s always there when you need him.On October 3, she placed the Seal of Babalon on his penis; two days later, theycelebrated their informal Thelemic wedding, feasting on tea, bread, ham, grapes,and figs. They consummated the marriage on October 7 with an act of sex magick.“Who is your best girl?” Leah asked as they made love.“You,” he replied.“What is thy will?”He recalled the purpose of this act. “To help establish the Law of Thelema.”“Who are you?” she asked pointedly.“Omnia Pro Veritate.” This answer disappointed Leah. When next they made love,Leah described it in her diary: “With a man who does not know who he is but iscommonly called Norman Mudd.”77[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts077]Mudd soon returned to London, unable to scrounge up any further money or arriveat any other means of support. On November 19 he signed himself into theMetropolitan Asylums Board home for the homeless poor. He gave his age asthirty-five and his occupation as literary agent.Leah, meanwhile, remained in France, finding temporary work washing dishes,peeling potatoes, and carrying coals in a Montparnasse restaurant for thirteenhours a day, waiting for Beast and Astrid to pay her passage to Tunis.By now, the Abbey was practically empty, Ninette having given all but two largecases to Aguel. Only Ninette, Arturo, and the children remained; and the fouryoung ones—with a fifth on the way—kept her busy. Mimi was eighteen months old,and when she wasn’t wandering off and making her mother look for her, her upsetstomach kept her constantly screeching as if she was being skinned alive. Thisracket put the other kids on edge, Lulu often hiding in the Umbilicus for peace.Although Crowley constantly sent as much money as he could to the Abbey,finances were worse than ever. They had neither coffee nor red meat, and onlythe kind heart of the milkman kept milk coming. She was again behind on therent, and la Calce threatened to evict her January 1. Desperate, she triedselling Raoul’s shoes to raise money for the milkman or to buy coal.Arturo, who had by now left home and moved into the Abbey, did his best to help;however, his pension came irregularly, and boils on his thumb and foot made itdifficult for him to work. At one point they quarreled so bitterly about moneythat Ninette finally threw him out.After ten days, Arturo returned penitently with fresh bread, kerosene, coffee,tea, and sugar. He had played his last six cents on a lottery, won, and spent iton her. “Santa Claus never was so thoughtful,” she bubbled to Leah:God, what good these little things did me. That was a change, and my spiritsbounced up like a balloon, and the boy did enjoy our delight.… Dear me, Lala, doyou know what that coffee and French bread tasted like? Months without coffee.This insipid bread and milk has become intolerable. I drank it with as reverenta feeling as if it had been ambrosia sent down by the Gods.… Perhaps I am crazy,Lala, but I feel happy.78 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts078]The man she loved, and the woman she once loathed as her fiercest competitor,she missed dearly. “I need but one satisfaction,” she wrote again, “i.e., alittle Lala to laugh out loud with, and to swap stories about the last eightmonths. When will we see you again? … Don’t write such beautifully neat,good-looking pages next time you write, Lala, but be sociable and fill every bitof your paper with nonsense. Chat if you have no special anxiety on yourmind.”79 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts079]Crowley returned to Tunis from his desert trek with Dorothy Olsen late inDecember 1924, three months after it began, finding his business in limbo. Janehad stopped typing the Hag while she took a rest cure for colitis, placingCrowley’s autobiography on indefinite hold. AC wrote to Mudd emphasizingpracticality: “We are now doing our best to pick up the pieces. You must notexpect everything at once and you must forget about Magick altogether.”80[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts080]Shortly thereafter, an intense trance engulfed Crowley, who recorded his vision,incorporating “To Man,” in The Heart of the Master.81[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts081]When Dorothy became pregnant, Crowley summoned Leah to assist in herconvalescence. The former Scarlet Woman—herself pregnant by a new student namedGeorge Barron—dutifully bought a third-class ticket and hurried to their side,much to Dorothy’s displeasure. Crowley recorded one late-night episode in hisdiary:A single drink of rum (on top of a good deal of mental worry during the day) wasenough to induce in Dorothy Olsen an attack of acute mania. Lying in bed, closecuddled, I nearly asleep, she suddenly started to scratch my face without theleast warning, with a spat of the filthiest incoherent abuse of me and everyoneconnected with me.82 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts082]Leah’s services became unnecessary, however, for Dorothy miscarried, and theyall returned to Paris.Leah found herself alone again, but friends like Gérard Aumont, Aimée Gouraud,and George Barron helped her keep her head together. Her will to die subsided infavor of a new vitality as she came to terms with life with and without Crowley.Giving herself over to anger, she wrote to Sir Aleister Crowley, “The Sir meansas little to me as ‘Lord’ Beaverbrook—Aleister is a mere wish phantasm.… You areno more a Magus than you are a cunt. You seem to disregard all Holy Books etc.in your sexual stupidity.”83 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts083]In the end, she discovered the detachment to distinguish between Crowley theprophet—a vehicle of the divine word that she most fervently accepted—andCrowley the man, who was capable of inexplicable coldness. “I do in the mainconsider him merely a Word, but it’s damn hard when one has to have ‘human’dealings with what appears to be the rottenest kind of creature, to think of itas an Idea.”84 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts084]Meanwhile at Cefalù, Ninette’s next child, Richard, was born; while la Calce didnot evict her on January 1 as threatened, the possibility loomed constantly. AsLeah wrote, “Ninette is threatened with expatriation: where that is to I am sureI don’t know. Is she American or French? Evidently her birth certificate andpassport are among the Customs’ spoils. Great collection, that!”85[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts085]The Thelemites gathered again in June 1925, more motley and desperate than ever.Drab Leah had learned simultaneously to admire and dislike Crowley. Dorothy—who,like so many of Crowley’s lovers, drank heavily—was suspicious and jealous ofthe former Scarlet Woman. And Mudd, who’d been homeless and hungry in London,believed Crowley to be straying farther and farther from the obligation givenhim by the Secret Chiefs in The Book of the Law. All they had in common wastheir mission to spread the word.Bringing them together was the Conference of Grand Masters being held in thesecluded twelfth-century German city of Weida, Thuringia. Heinrich Tränker(1880–1956), head of OTO’s German branch as Frater Recnartus and founder of hisown organization the Collegium Pansophicum (or Pansophical Lodge), was hostingthis convocation of chiefs of major occult organizations for the summersolstice. The only snag in the plan was that OTO currently had no leader: Reuss,the Outer Head of the Order, had died in 1923, and the remaining administrativeheads (X°) needed to elect a new Frater Superior. Crowley reasonably expectedthe honor would fall to him: not only had he students acting as X° in America,Africa, and Australia, but Tränker had a vision of Crowley leading OTO, whichconvinced him that Baphomet was the intended successor. In response to Tränker’svision, Crowley had American student Max Schneider translate The Book of the Lawinto German and send it ahead. When Tränker read the manuscript, he concluded itwas demonically inspired; yet before he could condemn it too strongly, anothervision cleared up everything and restored his faith. In a letter to Tränker,Crowley wrote, “Frater Peregrinus [Reuss] in the last letters that we exchangeddefinitely designated me to succeed him.”86[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts086] Similarly, he wrote to C. S.Jones:I now feel at liberty to inform you that in the O.H.O.’s [Outer Head of theOrder] last letter to me he invited me to become his successor as O.H.O. andFrater Superior of the Order and my reply definitely accepted. I cannot give theexact dates of these letters, and cannot be sure that he died before receivingmy reply.87 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts087]No records survive to document Reuss’s nomination of Crowley, but one observernoted, “The only fact that we know is that Reuss died and the above two electedAC as O.H.O.”88 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts088]On June 21, Crowley arrived at the home of the man who paid their fares toGermany. Frater Saturnus, known in the mundane world as Karl Germer (1885–1962),was Tränker’s personal secretary. University educated, he received first- andsecond-class Iron Crosses during the Great War for “special services,” probablyspying. Germer and Tränker were both members of the Pansophical Society. In1923, Germer sold his Vienna property and founded the publishing house PansophiaVerlag in Munich. Tränker was general editor, Pansophist Otto Wilhelm Barth89[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts089] oversaw sales, and Germer didtranslations and put up the capital. By the end of 1924, Germer began thinkingabout publishing Crowley translations exclusively, although he had never methim.Soon thereafter, Crowley met the remaining Grand Masters. Albin Grau(1884–1942), known by the magical name Pacitus, had been Master of the Chair inTränker’s Pansophical Lodge, the first Grand Master of Fraternitas Saturni, anda member of Crowley’sA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg].A painter, he worked as a set designer, art director, and costume designer onUFA Studios silent films such as Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau’s (1888–1931) classicunauthorized Dracula adaptation, Nosferatu—Eine Symphonie des Grauens(Nosferatu—A Symphony of Horror, 1922).90[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts090] Other films utilizing Grau’stalents included The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1919), Dr. Mabuse the Gambler(1922), Warning Shadows (1922), and The Nibelungs (1924).Eugen Grosche (1888–1964) ran an antiquarian and occult bookstore in Berlin.Grosche’s mother had been housekeeper of Berlin’s TS, and when Tränkersupplanted Rudolf Steiner as secretary in 1921, he also tapped Grosche toestablish a Berlin lodge of the Pansophical Society. This he did under themagical name Gregor A. Gregorius.Dr. Henri Clemens Birven (1883–1969), despite an apparently French ancestry, wasborn in Aachen, Germany. Although he studied philosophy in Berlin—even writing adissertation on Kant—professionally he lectured on electrical engineering.Finding himself a prisoner of Russia during the Great War, he escaped throughChina and ultimately returned to Berlin, where he taught at the HumboldtschuleTegel, one of Berlin’s top secondary schools. By 1927 he would begin publishingthe occult journal Hain der Isis (Veil of Isis), which would include some ofCrowley’s writings.Martha Küntzel (1857–1941), occultist and devoted student of Thelema, was knownaffectionately to Crowley as “Little Sister.” Küntzel and her lover, PansophicalLodge and OTO member Otto Gebhardi, had been involved in the TS. However, theLaw of Thelema proved to be Küntzel’s path, which she followed with the utmostdevotion.Germer’s friend Oskar Hopfer was a Thuringian publisher and technical artist whohelped Crowley devise a new 777, which placed correspondences on the appropriatesphere or path of a drawing of the Tree of Life in favor of a tabular listing.He was probably also the one to publish Ein Zeugnis der Suchenden, or “TheTestament of a Seeker.” Penned by Crowley with help from Mudd and Tränker, itwas another anti-Theosophical broadsheet that proclaimed the Master Therion tobe the new World Teacher.These eight—Tränker, Germer, Grau, Grosche, Birven, Küntzel, Hopfer, andCrowley—made up the conference, which ironically took place in the nation fromwhich, a year previously, anthroposophist and former OTO member Rudolph Steinerwas driven by Nazi persecution. The conference’s unfolding revolved around theMasters’ mixed feelings about Crowley. While Germer, Tränker, Küntzel, andGrosche hailed him eagerly, his irresponsible references to the IX° in hiswritings angered the others; Grau disliked The Book of the Law and renounced EinZeugnis. A debate split the Masters on this issue, and a heated and bitterargument between Crowley and Tränker drove the wedge deeper. In the end, Grau,Hopfer, and Birven sided with Tränker, who, as cosignatory of Ein Zeugnis,repudiated the document. Mudd appealed to Grau’sA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]membership in an effort to win his support, but the politics proved terminal.The Masters split into three camps: those who sided with Tränker in rejectingCrowley’s teachings; moderates like Grosche, who regarded Crowley a teacher andincorporated Thelema into his philosophy but nevertheless rejected him as OHO;and finally, Karl Germer and the others, who accepted Crowley as FraterSuperior.The schism destroyed the Pansophical Lodge, which would ritually close anddissolve on Maundy Thursday 1926; neither Tränker nor Grau were heard fromagain. On May 8, 1926, Grosche founded the Fraternitas Saturni, a magicalbrotherhood that accepted Thelema but remained independent of the MasterTherion. A third of the Pansophists flocked to this new organization, which in1928 began publishing its own magical papers and the journal Saturn Gnosis. Withthe subsequent collapse of Pansophia Verlag, in 1927 Germer would establish apress devoted to Crowley’s writings: Thelema Verlag.The differences of opinion that split OTO into different factions that summersoon split apart the magical family Crowley had built around himself.That August of 1925, the subtle conflict between Crowley and C. S. Jones came toa head. Although Jones had endorsed Crowley as OHO, Crowley found hisincreasingly unorthodox books on the kabbalah intolerable. When Jones was unableto account for book sales in Detroit, Crowley grew suspicious, suspended Jones’sofficer status in OTO, and placed Max Schneider in charge of his personal stock.Schneider arrived in Detroit to find two trunks of Crowley’s rariora gone. Thedifference between them—Jones protesting his innocence, and Crowley believinghimself robbed—would never be resolved. Not until the 1950s would it bediscovered that the books were not stolen by Achad but lost track of in aDetroit warehouse.Jones continued on his own eccentric path. Around 1930 he became Mahaguru (head)of an organization called the Universal Brotherhood, which he had joined aftermoving to Chicago. Around this same time, he converted to Catholicism in aneffort to introduce English papists to Thelema. Finally, in his paper TheTeachings of the New Aeon, he attacked Crowley and Thelema:The Beast may be considered as his own worst enemy, but Aiwaz is quite evidentlythe enemy of mankind, and should be recognized as such, if this new system,deliberately calculated to bring about the self-destruction of the human race,is to be rightly evaluated.91 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts091]His expulsion from OTO followed shortly thereafter.Leah and Mudd left Weida to live with Martha Küntzel and Otto Gebhardi in theirsmall abode. On December 4, 1925, Leah gave birth to Barron’s son. Although thefather had left her high and dry, she was indifferent, naming the baby Al afterthe god name that was the key to The Book of the Law. His nickname was Bubby.Although Alostrael lived up to Thelemic principles, Crowley grew distrustful ofher and her self-determined title of Babalon. He finally eliminated her byinstructing all OTO members to shun her as a “center of pestilence” per theShort Comment to Liber AL. Disgusted, Leah renounced both the Beast and hertitle on December 26, 1929. She returned to America to be with Alma and Hansiand to resume her job as a schoolteacher. She died at Meringen, Switzerland, onFebruary 22, 1975.Mudd’s story is even more bizarre. Late in 1925 he concluded Crowley hadcompletely failed his commission from the Secret Chiefs and was no better than afalse prophet. Mudd declared himself, as the only person to understand The Bookof the Law, the World Teacher. Küntzel called him a saboteur and threw him outof her house. Crowley would eventually banish him from the order. Mudd returnedto his father on the Isle of Man and on February 24, 1926, formally withdrew hissignature from Ein Zeugnis der Suchenden. In a 1927 letter to Jane Wolfe, hewrote, “I have dropped all interest in anything that calls itself magick and anykind of work that insists on a capital W.”92[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts092] On September 6, 1930, he andLeah sent Crowley a letter renouncing their magical oaths; then he faded fromthe scene altogether. On May 6, 1934, at about age forty-five, he took a room at220 Arling Road in Guernsey, an English Channel Island. A month later, hebicycle-clipped his pant-cuffs, filled his trousers and pockets with stones, andwaded into the English Channel. The hotel proprietor reported Mudd missing onJune 16, and the police recovered his body from Portlet Bay around noon thatsame day. “I feel sure that he must have left a long, elaborate mathematicalproof as to why he had to do this,” Crowley later remarked.93[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c16-nts093] One of the greatest andeeriest ironies of Crowley’s corpus is that The Winged Beetle (1910), publishedjust after Mudd first entered Crowley’s circle, contains a poem dedicated tohim; it is titled “The Swimmer.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENTEENTHE FRENCH CONNECTIONAround November 1925, Crowley left Weida and began working on his incisive andinspirational Little Essays Toward Truth. After a bout of ptomaine laid him upin Marseilles, he attended a party and met Ernest Hemingway, who described himsimply as “a tall, gray, lantern-jawed man.”1[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts001] In January 1926, Crowleysettled into a villa at La Marsa, Tunis. Jane Wolfe joined him for five monthsat the beginning of February. At this time, Crowley was also corresponding witha young Tom Driberg (1905–1976), who, at age twenty, was more concerned aboutfinding an artificial stimulant to help him pass his exams than about the LabourParty for which he would later become a member of Parliament.2[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts002] Crowley invited him to Tunisand later to Paris, but their acquaintance was largely confined tocorrespondence.While Crowley was in Tunis, Karl Germer took his wife, Maria, on a trip to theAbbey of Thelema. On January 10, 1926, Ninette received them in the empty shellthat was once the stronghold of Thelema. Dirty and dilapidated, just abouteverything had been sold off. The living conditions appalled Germer. Although hestayed at the Abbey until at least February, he joined Crowley in Tunis thatApril, describing bluntly and exactly the conditions at the Abbey. Although thisconvinced AC that Lulu, now five years old, should come to Tunis for proper careand education, repeated complications and miscommunications prevented it.The positive reception of the Mediterranean Manifesto, coupled with therealization that publicity was the key to putting over the Great Work,encouraged Crowley to spend much of 1926 absorbed in his “World Teacher”campaign. “The Only way of getting proper publicity is to arrange for the WorldTeacher campaign,” Crowley wrote, hoping Evans or someone else with journalisticconnections would pick it up. This World Teacher campaign sought to use as itsspringboard the publicity that Annie Besant and Charles Leadbeater of the TSprepared to introduce the world to Jiddu Krishnamurti (1895-1986), the boy theyhad groomed to be the next messiah. Theosophy based its concept of the WorldTeacher on the Buddhist Maitreya, a future bodhisattva or enlightened being,which Leadbeater equated with Christ. Leadbeater discovered Krishnamurti as ayoung teenager on the beach of the TS headquarters at Adyar in 1909. Declaringhim the vessel for the expected World Teacher, Leadbeater and Besant adopted himand began preparing him for this role. In 1911 the Theosophists founded theOrder of the Star in the East to prepare for the World Teacher’s arrival, and in1926, Krishnamurti began a lecture tour of the United States as this WorldTeacher. Crowley planned to use the TS’s propaganda to declare himself, notKrishnamurti, the World Teacher. “If this is done as it should be, there isbound to be a big scrap with unlimited stories of excellent news value.”3[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts003] Thus, AC wrote defiantly toMontgomery Evans, “The World Teacher informs the public that Doctor Annie Besantis in error when she states that He will manifest through Mr. Krishnamurti inDecember, or at any other time.”4[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts004] Characteristically, Crowleywas full of unkind opinions:About Krishnamurti: There is no objection on my part to pæderasty as such. Thisis a totally different matter. It is the question of the following practice,which I class as black magical because it is unnecessary, uneconomical from themagical standpoint, and likely to arouse highly undesirable forces as being inopposition to the Law of Thelema.5[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts005]On H. P. Blavatsky’s successor, Crowley called Besant “totally devoid of allspiritual greatness, as of moral decency.”6[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts006]The TS was naturally on Crowley’s radar as it influenced every occultistcontemporary with Crowley, from Westcott and the rest of the GD to his ownstudents, like Frank Bennett. As strongly as Crowley admired its founder, H. P.Blavatsky, he disliked just as strongly, if not more so, her successors. WhenAnnie Besant introduced Co-Masonry to England in connection with the TS in 1902,Crowley was outraged. This reaction was only exacerbated when Yarker, in hislast years, befriended not only Crowley (and thereby OTO) but also Co-Masonry,contributing to its journal and receiving an extensive obituary;7[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts007] likewise when Co-Mason J. I.Wedgwood attended the first meeting to elect Yarker’s successor.8[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts008] When Crowley prepared hiscommented edition of Blavatsky’s Voice of the Silence as the supplement to theblue Equinox, he expected it not only to send tremors through the TS, but to“have the San Francisco earthquake looking like 30¢.”9[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts009] Indeed, at that time Crowleywent so far as to draft a manifesto to the TS, declaring himself Blavatsky’ssuccessor; seeking to turn weakness into strength, Crowley even argued(unconvincingly) in his document, “The fact that he has never compromisedhimself with any branch of the T.S. is highly significant.”10[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts010] Thus Crowley’s currentcampaign was an expression of his long-standing ideas regarding Theosophy.Mudd, who was still collaborating with Crowley at this time, would sneak intoLondon’s TS headquarters and pin the Mediterranean Manifesto to their bulletinboard. Crowley followed it up with several other broadsheets swiping at the TS.“The World Teacher to the Theosophical Society” read:The World-Teacher sayeth:Find, each of you, your own true Way in the Universe, and follow it with eagerjoy!There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt!Do that, and no other shall say nay.Greeting and Peace!ANKH-F-N-KHONSU,the Priest of the Princes.Next, “The Avenger to the Theosophical Society” was more to the point:You have done well to protest against the grotesque mummeries of the bottle-fedMessiah; you will still do wisely to beware of its Jesuitical wire-pullers. Theattempted usurpation is most sinister Black Magic of the Brothers of theLeft-hand Path.I need not remind you of the shameless and nauseating fraud by which the GrandOld Procuress worked herself into the presidency of your Society, of her blatantattempts to capture various rites of Freemasonry, and her imbecile parodies ofthe Romish heresy, of the obscene manusturpations practised by Leadbeater on thewretched Krishnamurti, with a view of making him a docile imbecile, in imitationof the traditions of the Dalai Lamas, or of a thousand other duplicities,tergiversations, and crimes. It is your daily shame to remember.April 1926 saw Driberg distributing these broadsheets for Crowley.If, as Dorothy Olsen reported, “At last this World Teacher business seems tohave caught fire everywhere and we are being interviewed by newspapers and thenewspapers seem to be taking it up as quite important news,”11[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts011] they must have been incidentalpresses since no articles survive among Crowley’s papers. In the end, thecampaign fizzled like many of AC’s other grand schemes. Likewise Krishnamurti,it turns out, was uninterested in his spiritual calling, declaring he was notthe World Teacher and precipitating an embarrassing crisis for the TS.Crowley published a most rare edition of The Book of the Law on April 9, thetwenty-second anniversary of the writing of its second chapter. It consisted ofphotographic reproductions of the original sixty-five handwritten pages, housedas loose sheets in a maroon leather box; the title leaf was printed in red andblack ink on handmade paper. He printed only eleven copies of this work, thefirst eight being presentation copies for Crowley, Dorothy, Leah, Jane, Karl, C.S. Jones, Otto Gebhardi, and student Dorothea Walker. Only three copies were forsale, one for each of three countries at £93, $418, and 2,542 reichsmarks.12[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts012] Leah returned her copy of thebook along with a scathing letter:I therefore return Copy No. 2 of your Book, signifying thereby that I revoke allmy recognition of you heretofore as Beast, or Priest of the Princes, or ashaving any authority whatsoever in respect of the Law of Thelema.13[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts013]Karl Germer, who received the unenviable job of selling the American edition ofthe book, emigrated to the United States with his wife, Maria, on June 12. Hechecked Crowley’s book stock in Detroit, confirming it was missing. Achad hadtaken a larger trunk of books to sell in Chicago, but the whereabouts of thesecond remained unknown. “Achad never handed over the storage checks for us togo seriously into the matter,” Germer recalled.14[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts014] So he got a job, cut backexpenses, and sent Crowley the better part of his income to keep the Great Workgoing: of his $190 monthly salary, he sent Crowley $100.Although Crowley bought a magical dagger to banish malignant forces andimpediments, turmoil nevertheless dogged him. Six days after joining Dorothy andJane in France that August, he had a major row with Dorothy. As Jane describedit in her diary, “Dorothy went on a mad ranting, raving explosion last nightwhich continued until 2:00 a.m.”15[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts015] Two days later, Crowley leftfor Bordeaux, realizing that Dorothy wasn’t his ideal Scarlet Woman after all.Although she remained his lover for a time, she left England on Crowley’sfifty-second birthday to continue the Great Work in Chicago.Once again, Beast went on the prowl for a suitable sex-magical partner. He foundmany candidates, including one Louis Eugene de Cayenne. Crowley’s January 2,1927, diary entry describes the extent of his quest: “Eugene and all his tribedisappeared, leaving me with nine mistresses in Paris.… I am now eliminatingthese one by one.”16 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts016] Alas,none of Crowley’s subsequent Scarlet Women would live up to the precedents setby seers like Rose Kelly, Mary Desti, and Roddie Minor, let alone the pillars ofstrength represented by Leila Waddell and Leah Hirsig.The most promising contender for the role of Scarlet Woman at this time was K.Margaret Binetti. Crowley met her at the end of August, and despite hispromiscuous sex magick couplings, they soon became engaged. Margaret lackedinterest in magic and the philosophical rationale behind his infidelity, andthis strained their relationship. Crowley soon reconsidered spending his lifewith the woman to whom he wrote “Lines on being seduced by Madame Binetti.”17[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts017] On February 6, 1927, he burnedthe talisman of Jupiter he had consecrated for her. “Her callous heartlessnessand hypocritical falsity doom her to dire ends,”18[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts018] he recorded in his diary, thencast out his net once again.In March 1927, Germer, now living in Boston, foundedThelema-Verlags-Gesellschaft to publish German translations of Crowley’scomplete works as quickly as possible. Its cofounders included Gebhardi, Hopfer,and Küntzel. In quick succession, they published Book Four, The Heart of theMaster, “The Three Schools of Magick,” and “The Message of the Master Therion.”Despite the press’s promise, this was otherwise a time of failure for Crowley.Hopfer’s color, diagrammatic revision of 777 was a great idea but would cost anunreasonable $100 per copy. Similarly, plans for a book on the oracle ofgeomancy, to sell with a box painted in flashing colors and filled with holysand from Mecca or Jerusalem, remained just an idea.Finally, on March 9, a final nail sealed the coffin on Crowley’s Cefalù period.Ninette wrote a letter complaining of her seven years in Cefalù, “Thinking toomuch, making resolutions and taking oaths, keeping none, violating my betterimpulses, have worn my nerves to shreds.” Then she bid Jane and Beast “aneternal Adieu.”19 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts019] The Abbey’sfinancial situation was dire, and although he wired Ninette £500, Crowleyrealized his dream of a Thelemic community was a lost cause. The best plan wasto get Ninette and the children back to France and cut their losses.Mrs. Kasimira Bass learned of Crowley from Thelemite Wilfred T. Smith whileliving in California. She was born on February 10, 1887, in Lemberg, Austria(modern-day Lviv in western Ukraine), a historically Polish city that becamepart of Austria in 1772. With an eight-year-old daughter, Marian, from herprevious marriage in Vienna, Kasimira de Helleparth emigrated to the UnitedStates aboard the SS Majestic, arriving in New York on December 12, 1922. Threedays later she married John F. Bass Jr. in Cleveland, Ohio. The fact that shesettled in Glendale, California, in December 1923 while her husband lived inChicago suggests that the marriage may have been arranged to help her obtaincitizenship.20 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts020] While living inSouthern California she met Smith, and while traveling in Europe she stopped inFrance to meet Crowley.AC took her to dinner and, to her surprise, proposed. Four times. He wanted tomarry her in Paris the next day. She was too stunned to answer. The next day,having met her daughter Marian, he proposed again. This time, she explained shehad to return to Poland (her birthplace had reverted from Austrian back toPolish rule from 1918 to 1939), but promised to return. Crowley wrote to Smith,“I thank you for the galleon of treasure which came under full sail into porthere last week. Unfortunately, she has chartered to make more distant shores.”21[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts021] Nevertheless, he hoped to takeher to Egypt, where he had had such stunning magical success with Rose.On October 1, Jane Wolfe, the last remaining member of the Cefalù community,sailed for New York. Crowley was sad to see her go, but she would carry on theGreat Work in America with Dorothy and Karl, and supervise students Max andLeota Schneider and W. T. Smith in California. She hoped to return to acting,but would soon find herself blacklisted for her connection to the notoriousAleister Crowley; after returning to Hollywood, she would have a role in onlyone other film, Under Strange Flags (1937).Gerald Joseph Yorke (1901–1983) stood in the Paris airport on New Year’s Eve1927, waiting to meet Aleister Crowley. He was born two months prematurely in1901, the second of three sons to landowner and industrialist Vincent WodehouseYorke (1869–1957) and Hon. Maud Evelyn Wyndham (1874–1963), daughter of HenryWyndham, the second Baron Leconfield.22[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts022] Attending Eton and graduatingwith distinction from Cambridge, he had played cricket for Gloucestershire in1925, making a first-class appearance in a game that season against Glamorgan.23[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts023] His youngest brother, HenryVincent (1905–1973), was an aspiring writer, his first novel Blindness (1926)having appeared the previous year; he would go on to renown under the pen nameHenry Green, his sixth book Loving (1945) making Time magazine’s list of the“100 Best English-Language Novels from 1923 to 2005.”24[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts024]After graduation, Gerald began to study The Equinox and Crowley’s other magicalwritings. He was bright enough to distrust the rumors circulating about Crowleyand judge the man for himself, so he contacted Crowley through J. G. Bayley andreceived an invitation to meet the Master in Paris. What he encounteredimpressed him immensely: Crowley struck Yorke as a brilliant and talented manwith tremendous unrealized potential. His unpublished manuscripts testified tothe many important lessons Crowley still had to teach the world … he only lackeda business manager to make a success of his work. Crowley took Yorke’senthusiasm as an offer and accepted. While The Book of the Law prophesied a richman from the west, he found instead a benefactor from Germany and a rich boyfrom Gloucestershire.In January 1928 Yorke took the name Volo Intellegere (I will to understand) uponjoining theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg],and he devoted his spare time to managing Crowley’s finances. He sold hisChinese paintings and ivories to raise money and, that spring, put £400 into apublication account to rehabilitate Crowley’s name and publish his works. Fromthis fund, Yorke paid Crowley a weekly allowance of £10. He also wrote the eightremainingA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]members—including Jacobi, Wolfe, Olsen, and Smith—to regularize their membershipsubscriptions and permit Crowley to continue writing without monetary concerns;of these, only Jacobi regularly contributed $20 a month to the cause, forcingCrowley to rely on the Germers for much of his support. Nevertheless, thispermitted Crowley a furnished flat at 55 Avenue de Suffren in Paris.Yorke also paid a typist to copy Crowley’s manuscripts for publication. One ofthese new projects was AC’s magnum opus, part three of Book Four, Magick inTheory and Practice. Of this manuscript, Crowley wrote to Yorke:Montague Summers appears to know what he is talking about. People generally dowant a book on Magick. There never has been an attempt at one, anyhow since theMiddle Ages, except Lévi’s.25 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts025]Alphonsus Joseph-Mary Augustus Montague Summers (1880–1948), occult scholar,offered a curious contrast to AC. Whereas the latter identified with theinfernal trappings of the Great Beast while explicating the holy quest for one’sdivine nature, the former was an ordained deacon of the Church of England whospecialized in demonology and black magic. Nevertheless the two men shared amutual respect. Éliphas Lévi, also cited in the above quote, Crowley claimed ashis previous incarnation, and a translation of his book, The Key of theMysteries, appeared as a supplement to The Equinox I(10). Crowley correctlystates the literary primacy of his book: whereas Montague Summers, A. E. Waite,and even Francis Barrett (The Magus, 1801) were primarily purveyors of medievaltraditions, Magick in Theory and Practice was the first modern textbook on thesubject in English. How big a market existed for such a book was another matterentirely.Alas, managing Crowley’s old stock of books was more complicated than Yorke hadimagined. While he hoped to inventory these books, Yorke found them scatteredaround the world: in Chicago with Achad and Olsen, in Naples with Aguel(presumably), in Leipzig with Küntzel, and in London with Pickford’s storage.The latter stock (early works of poetry), he discovered, had been damaged whenPickford’s storage facilities flooded; although Crowley valued these books atthousands of pounds, professional booksellers hired by Yorke estimated that evena good salesperson would be lucky to realize £200 on them. Yorke settled withPickford’s for the balance of past charges and £40 damages. He then paid theAmerican Express Company to ship Crowley’s remaining works from Naples toCrowley’s Paris address.Finally, Yorke kept AC’s pipe dreams in perspective: one such scheme involvedMetro-Goldwyn’s film adaptation of Maugham’s The Magician, which was opening onthe Grand Boulevard March 23. Since Crowley received no compensation as themodel of Oliver Haddo, he filed an injunction against showing the film. However,when representatives from the film company offered to pay Crowley, he refused.“The lawsuit is a pretext for a business deal,” he explained to Yorke. “I’mholding out for publicity and power.”26[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts026] Crowley wanted a contract toproduce a series of educational films on magick. Yorke was pessimistic about thescheme.I cannot say that I think you will get any damages from Metro-Goldwyn over TheMagician film. Your reputation is too bad to be damaged by that. Nor do I thinkthere is any hope for rehabilitation of character. To my mind, part of your“mission,” if I may use a word I mistrust, is to show that the code of morals ofwhat a Thelemite calls the Old Aeon has been superseded, and that now any act isright provided it is done in the right way, as in interpretation of True Will.It must have been your Will to be the Beast, and a whitewashed Beast is anuseless commercial article.27 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts027]He was right: when Crowley could have taken a quick financial settlement, hepushed too hard and got nothing at all from the film company.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_075_r1.jpg]Promotional leaflet for Metro-Goldwyn Pictures’ adaptation of The Magician.(photo credit 17.1) [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c17-fig001a]Kasimira Bass returned to Crowley that spring. While they didn’t run off andmarry, they did find bliss together. “She is the one possible magical partnerfor me, and she is perfect,” Crowley enthused. “Already, despite the greatestdifficulties, we have succeeded beyond all my hopes in awakening a current ofcreative energy of enormously high potential.”28[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts028] Although she began signing herletters to W. T. Smith as 156,29[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts029] she complained that herstandard of living fell below the expectations Crowley had given her. While hewas used to living hand to mouth with faith that the gods would provide for hisneeds, Kasimira had no such conviction. “This is her first experience of livingunder magical laws,” he commented on their finances, “so that the funny littleways of the Gods rather get on her nerves.”30[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts030] They soon began quarrelingover money and other petty matters. By June 6, Crowley’s glowing praise of hermagical talent declined to “Kasimira is that same cauliflower Ego whichdestroyed Achad.”31 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts031]During the summer of 1928, Ninette’s daughter Mimi was in the hospital fortwenty-four days with a fever, measles. and bronchitis. Public assistance was insorry shape there, and, penniless, Ninette could obtain no better care for herchild. She wrote desperately to Crowley and Kasimira, begging for help, but toCrowley’s frustration forgot to include her address. He had no way to respond.That season, Crowley met Lance Sieveking, whose book he cited in The Diary of aDrug Fiend. The young author was in St. Tropez recovering from his wife’sleaving him for another man. Crowley walked the beach with Sieveking, consolingand conversing; he later did Sieveking’s horoscope and put him in touch withYorke to work on Magick. Both Yorke and Sieveking agreed that no Englishpublisher would touch the manuscript; and even if one did, they believedScotland Yard and the Home Office would object and the Beaverbrook press wouldsuppress it. Although Yorke could have printed it privately, he feared theconsequences and encouraged Crowley to seek a U.S. printer.With £190 left in the publication fund, Yorke was now pulling out—from histrusteeship and from his editorship. His change of heart stemmed from personaldifficulties with The Book of the Law:The crux of the matter is a) I have tried to accept the Law of Thelema and theNew Aeon with you as [images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L06_r1.jpg] [Savior of theUniverse], Liber Legis [The Book of the Law] as the book, and Thelema as thelogos. I cannot accept it. Liber Legis and its claims have bothered methroughout, as it bothered you until it beat you, and I suspect still does.… Icannot therefore support a movement whose sole aim is to spread the teachingcontained in Liber Legis and the commentaries thereon.… Owing to my convictions,therefore, I cannot honestly assist in the practical handling of a publicationfund or the raising of money for that purpose.32[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts032]So Crowley hired Carl de Vidal Hunt (b. 1869) to prepare the public for hisbook. After becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1895, Hunt settled in LosAngeles,33 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts033] where he becamepart of the nascent motion picture industry, appearing in such early films asRoaring Camp (1916), The Marriage of Arthur (1916), and Jeremias (1922).34[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts034] While in his mid-fifties, hebecame a journalist, writing racy human interest stories that were syndicatedacross America.35 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts035] In Crowley’semploy, he published a story about Hollywood “film mother” Jane Wolfe’s stay atCefalù as a resident of the “mystery house” run by “Sir Aleister Crowley, highpriest of Thelema (oriental philosophy)”:Sir Aleister, known among his disciples as the “Beast,” is a Britisher, whospent his patrimony in search of the stoic philosophies of the East. He hadlived with the Yogis in the silent wastes of India and had published books onthe subject. Now he is a wanderer, barred even from his own country—but hisfriends declare him a genius.36[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts036]When publishers Turnbull became interested in taking Magick, Crowley gave them a£200 deposit; however, they returned his deposit at the end of October after herefused to let them edit problematic passages.About this time, Kasimira announced she was getting £3,000 for Beast’spublication fund. Yorke loaned her £200 against a promissory note, but it soonbecame clear that Kasimira was skimming money off the publication account. Yorkesuggested Crowley dump her. AC concurred, writing in his diary,K. has been acting outrageously for some days. She is stupidly jealous of mytalking to Yorke. She sulks and rages without sense. She complains of everythingin the most idiotic way. She interferes with every act one does. It isintolerable, save for the Magical Necessity.I definitely appeal to the Gods to let this Cup pass from me.37[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts037]Young Philadelphian art student Francis Israel Regardie (1907–1985) was bornIsrael Regudy in London on November 17, 1907, to a pair of poor Orthodox Jewishimmigrants from Russia: cigarette maker Barnet Regudy and his wife, PhoebePerry. The family name, Regudy, was mistakenly recorded as “Regardie” whenIsrael’s older brother joined the army, and the family adopted this spellingwhen it emigrated to Washington, D.C., in August 1921, where young Regardiestudied art. At age fifteen he also began studying H. P. Blavatsky, Easternscriptures, and yoga. When, at age eighteen, a lawyer friend read him Crowley’swritings on yoga from Book Four, their simplicity and clarity stunned him. As aresult, his yoga interests quickly extended to magick. He read every Crowleytitle he could find, and he contacted the author in 1926. Crowley put him intouch with Germer, whom he met in New York and thereby acquired a set of TheEquinox. Around this same time, he also received special dispensation as a minorto join the Washington College of the Societas Rosicruciana in America, takinghis 0=0 degree in March 1926 and his Zelator initiation in June 1927.38[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts038]When Crowley sought a new secretary during the summer of 1928, he wrote Regardieand offered him the job. He dearly wanted it but, as a minor, needed parentalpermission to obtain a passport. Knowing his parents would never let him studymysticism in France with Aleister Crowley, he told his father he had beeninvited to study with an artist in England.He sailed from New York, arriving at the noisy Gare St. Lazare station on themorning of October 12. Through the backdrop of French conversation he heard adistinctly British voice say, “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.”Regardie turned to face Crowley, tall and pudgy, dressed in blue-gray plusfours. They shook hands—firm, Regardie noticed—then gathered his luggage. Theytook a taxi to Crowley’s flat, where AC made them coffee in a glass apparatusheated by an alcohol lamp. Thus Regardie, henceforth known as Frater NChSh(Serpent) or Frater Scorpio, became Crowley’s new secretary. He was not yettwenty-one.In person, Crowley proved to be venerable. He played chess frequently becausehis phlebitis often kept him homebound. On weekends when Yorke visited, he wouldset each of them up at a chessboard; then, seated in his favorite chair, smokinga pipe of perique tobacco and warming a snifter of brandy, he would sit with hisback to them and call out his moves, playing them both simultaneously. Mostamazing was that he usually won.Crowley spent much of his energy teasing timid Regardie, trying to persuade himto be a bit more outgoing. At one point he suggested Regardie forget aboutmagick altogether and first hit the streets of Paris in order to becomeacquainted with every human vice. One evening he and Kasimira went out to seethe sights of Paris and watch a movie. There, away from Beast’s watchful eye,she confided in him: she was leaving Crowley and wanted Regardie to deliver themessage.Hearing the news, Crowley shrugged and calmly responded, “The Lord giveth, andthe Lord taketh away.” On November 3 he recorded in his diary simply, “Kasimirabolted.” In a candid note to Yorke, he wrote:Relieved from the strain of Kasimira, I have been able to start serious magickwith ritual precautions. The Climax of the first ceremony was marked, as itshould be, by the sudden arising of a violent wind; and subsequent ceremonieshave been equally notable.39 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts039]Shortly thereafter, the mage was furious to learn that his ex-fiancée hadpreviously been the lover of W. T. Smith, to whom he wrote:You send me a letter in which you tell me as plainly as anything can possibly dothat she has been your mistress. She presents me this letter and imagines that Iwill not understand anything by it and dismiss the whole thing for weeks andmonths until, in a burst of confidence, the cat comes out of the bag. I am nowlooking like Diogenes with a lantern of much greater power to find somebodywhose mistress she has not been.40[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts040]A year later, Kasimira Bass would be safe and happy, conducting business inSouth America, eventually finding her way back to the United States.Crowley was now paying Hunt £20 a month for his services. Besides preparing theBritish public for the appearance of Magick in Theory and Practice and editinghis Confessions, Hunt was responsible for arranging Crowley’s marriage to awealthy woman who would support his work. One potential wife, Cora Eaton, didnot work out but, on January 15, 1929, she married Karl Germer in Jersey City.Since Germer was supporting Crowley, the result was almost as if Crowley hadmarried her himself. Cora, however, was not as willing as Germer to hand overher money to the Master.By November 8, 1928, Crowley found a new mistress in Nicaraguan-born MariaTeresa Ferrari de Miramar. A dark, short divorcée, she was charmingly convivialdespite her poor grasp of English. Crowley called her “marvellous beyondwords,”41 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts041] and she certainlymade an impression: Jack Lindsay described her as “a fairly well-blown woman,oozing a helpless sexuality from every seam of her smartly cut suit, withshapely legs crossed and uncrossed.”42[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts042] Regardie’s first dinner withthe new Scarlet Woman was likewise memorable: while he was busy pondering whichutensil was proper to use for which portion of the meal, Crowley fell upon Marieand began humping her right on the floor.Her magical talents were also remarkable. She claimed to have conjured the devilon four occasions while dancing around bonfires in Nicaragua, and Crowleyattested to her abilities shortly after their meeting, “She has absolutely theright ideas of Magick and knows some Voudou.… We did proper ritualconsecrations, and arranged for the next Work.”43[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts043] Soon thereafter, AC noted inhis diary the consequences of their magical workings:The Magical Phenomena in this apartment are now acute. Lights and shadows,dancing sparks, noises as of people walking about, a large dark ghost in thebedroom lobby, short attacks of rheumatism (to 3 of us) and a Nameless Fearwhich seized Regardie.44 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts044]The following day, he also wrote about these manifestations to Yorke:The phenomena that have taken place in this apartment since the High Priestessof Voodoo [Marie de Miramar] displaced the woman from Samaria [Kasimira Bass]would be quite interesting to the Psychical Research Society, if any of them arenot in a coma.45 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts045]Visiting Paris in December 1928, Yorke recounts in his diary an impromptumagical working with Crowley, de Miramar, and Regardie. While Crowley banishedand recited the Bornless One invocation, Marie saw visions and did a dance toevoke a fire spirit.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_076_r1.jpg]Maria Theresa Ferrari de Mirimar and Aleister Crowley. (photo credit 17.2)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c17-fig002a]By this point, relations between Hunt and Crowley deteriorated. Hunt, realizinghe had his work cut out for him, complained to Yorke of Crowley’s “dormant,inarticulate, wheezy way of speaking what little he has to say.”46[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts046] Crowley, meanwhile, opinedHunt’s limitation is that he sees everything in terms of journalism. He isapparently unaware of the existence of the serious occult public. The troublewith him is that he is a cynic. If he could only believe in people and look fornoble motives instead of base ones.47[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts047]In Crowley’s mind, Hunt, with his irons in too many fires, was unable to devoteenough time to any.Their business dealings came to a head when Hunt asked Crowley to “fix” thehoroscopes of a couple to show them as perfectly compatible. “Hunt was bribed bythe Infanta Eulalia, the mother of Don Louis, to arrange a marriage by which herson should get about £24,000 a year settled on him for life,” Crowleyrecorded;48 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts048] to Hunt’sdispleasure, he refused to sell the Great Work. Before long, Crowley stoppedpaying him altogether.Hunt promised dire consequences if AC did not pay his salary. “It is a type ofblackmail well known in France,” Crowley scoffed,49[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts049] and his friend Gérard Aumontconcurred. Yorke also noted, “Hunt had written me what AC interpreted as ablackmail letter. It probably was the first step towards blackmail.”50[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts050] Nevertheless, Hunt took astack of Crowley’s news cuttings and the manuscript of Mortadello to thePrefecture. He also told the official that Crowley had been questioned regardingrumors that he had strangled three women in Sicily, and asked the authorities tolook into the matter.In response, Crowley alleged that Hunt had stolen his employer’s personalproperty, i.e. the manuscripts. Furthermore, AC argued, Hunt showed bad faith bygoing to the police with papers entrusted to him as Crowley’s agent. “His firstcapital was the pennies he stole off his dead mother’s eyes,” Crowley said.51[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts051] As with his Metro-Goldwynstunt, Crowley wasn’t out to ruin Hunt as much as he hoped to drum up publicityfor Magick.Learning of this conflict, Yorke was furious. He had planned to sink a fortuneinto printing Magick, and now AC threatened to ruin it with a spate of badpublicity. He fired off a virulent criticism:you are a bloody, not a divine, fool in attacking Hunt. To start with, he wasnot in our employ when he sent those papers to the Prefecture. He told me at thetime, and wrote to me afterwards, that he honestly thought it was impossible tohelp you, as you would not play up to the necessary parlour tricks, and thatyour past reputation was too much of a good thing. He could not, therefore,continue to take your money. He introduced you to good people, and can make agood showing that he worked for you. It was my honest opinion at the time thathe was doing his best, and I wrote and told him so at the time.52[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts052]Such blunt exchanges typified the Crowley-Yorke correspondence from this period.Referring to The Book of the Law ii.59–60, Yorke said their dealings should“Strike hard and low” when they disagree; if they were kingly men, brutallyhonest words would not hurt them.When, on December 14, 1928—nearly a year after he first met Crowley—Yorke becametrustee of the fund set up for Lola Zaza, he wrote AC’s oldest daughter andsuggested that she, now a woman of twenty-two making seventeen shillings a weekas a showroom assistant for a West End dressmaker, meet her father. She replied:I wrote to my uncle, and he said that I am old enough to choose for myself. Iwill give you certain books to read, he said, and they will help you think. So Iread parts of them. After all, an author’s work is a part of himself. So I havejudged him by his own works and what could be fairer? But the answer is no. Ireally have no time to spend on a man so rude or conceited. His works are a partof him and I am very sorry for the other part. What a hash he has made of it.53[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts053]Her polite refusal must have been a disappointment for Crowley, who sodesperately wanted a family. A few years later, on June 9, 1934, she would marryboot and shoe operative Frank Hill; she would outlive her husband, dying of amyocardial infarction at Battle Hospital, Reading, on March 9, 1990.54[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts054] She would never reconcile withher father.At age twenty-seven, Yorke became director of both Mexican Railways and H.Pontifex & Sons. He offered £800 toward the publication of Magick in Theory andPractice with a promise of another £1,000. By the end of December, Lecram Pressof Paris agreed to take the job. Crowley soon had an estimate in hand and aprospectus in press. He also decided on the book’s format: “By issuing Magick infour parts,” he told Yorke, “we save 12% buying tax.”55[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts055]AC believed this publication had set a powerful magical current into motion.Looking at the turmoil in his life—Kasimira leaving, Hunt threatening, plusminor events like Regardie getting sick and Marie becoming paranoid—he sawhimself under magical attack. His most important works always met withdifficulty going to press.On January 9, 1929, Kasimira and Marie encountered each other on a bus. Exactlywhat transpired between them is unclear, as Marie seemed prone to paranoia andexaggeration. Based on Marie’s report, Crowley described the incident asfollows:Having departed for Fontainebleau on Friday afternoon, Mdme de Miramar wentforth for her own base purposes … I think to the cinema … on Saturday afternoon.She was followed, I understand, more or less from the house or its vicinity byMrs. Bass. At any rate, Kasimira took her seat beside Mdme de Miramar on theomnibus, accosted her, and began a sort of cinema Roman conversation. She wasevidently quite furious at having lost her last chance in life.56[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts056]Fearing Kasimira might throw sulfuric acid on her, Marie ran. It convincedCrowley that Kasimira was plotting against him with Hunt.Domestic worries continued as an ailing Regardie entered the hospital. OnJanuary 13, 1929, he was back home again, but would soon thereafter contractgonorrhea from a prostitute.On the afternoon of January 17, an inspector from the Sûreté Générale called atCrowley’s flat to question Paris’s celebrated visitor. When Crowley opened hisdoor, the man walked right in and plopped down on a chair. “May I offer you aseat?” Crowley asked with mock politeness. He was immediately suspicious.The inspector rattled off a series of disconnected questions for Crowley toanswer: why did Regardie lack a carte d’identité (identification card)? Why didpeople refer to Crowley as the King of Depravity? Taking keen interest inCrowley’s Bunsen-powered coffee machine, he asked if it was a drug distillery.Did he take drugs? Was he ever expelled from the United States? Did he writepro-German propaganda during the war? Was he the head of a German occultorganization? Was he actually a German spy?Crowley did his best to set the inspector straight. This wasn’t the first timethe authorities got him wrong. As he recounted at this time,We have a very valuable witness in Aumont.… I once gave a little tea-party atthe Tunisia Palace Hotel, and somebody brought him along as interested inliterature. Within a few hours the police called upon him, and asked him if heknew who he had been having tea with, because it was a man who had strangledthree women in Sicily.57 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts057]The nature of these questions, however, demonstrated that Crowley’s colorfulreputation was finally catching up with him. Where had he lived for the pastyear?“I have a friend here in France,” Crowley answered, “Dr. Henri Birven, who callsme the Patriarch of Montparnasse. I first went to Montparnasse in 1899 andsettled down there in 1902. Since that date, I have lived constantly there.”Crowley paused and looked at the inspector askance; “the only exceptions beingwhen I was elsewhere.”58 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts058]Referring to his diary, Crowley gave the Inspector the address of every hotel hehad stayed at for the last year, plus the date and hour of his every move.Wearied by details, the inspector moved on. “People come to consult you. Andwhat do you advise them to do?”“That depends entirely upon the questions. My sheet anchor is common sense. Inany case, I should not advise them to do anything against the law, which Ihonestly respect as far as it will allow me to do so.”“And how much are you paid for your advice?”“I take no money for consultations.”He was incredulous. “None?”“None.”“Do you tell fortunes?”“No.”Stumped, he moved on to the kabbalah.“It takes seven years of uninterrupted study to even begin to know about it,”Crowley answered. To the bewilderment of the Inspector, he launched into a longdisquisition on the kabbalah.After a while, the inspector commented, “For the first time in my life, I don’tunderstand at all what is being said to me.”Crowley smiled. “This is very natural: I have been spending over fifty yearstrying to make myself clear, but nobody seems to benefit by my endeavors.”59[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts059]At that, the inspector became polite. When he concluded the interview, he seemedsatisfied that Crowley was a decent man.But on February 15, Crowley learned that the authorities had declined to renewhis identity card, issuing a refus de séjour despite his frequent visits since1920. The news came as a shock, and Crowley searched for a reason: that idiotinspector thought his coffee machine a cocaine distillery; or that miscreantHunt cried to his government contacts because Crowley refused to falsify thosehoroscopes to cement an arranged marriage; or perhaps Regardie’s sister, worriedabout her brother’s welfare, had asked the authorities to intervene. Perhaps allof these played a role. When Paris Midi reported Crowley had been expelled—notmerely having his identity card renewal denied—for being a German spy using OTOas his cover, matters only became worse.Crowley wrote to the British Embassy, but they would not intercede on hisbehalf.60 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts060] He then wired Yorketo come over and help clear up the mess. Yorke, reluctant to have himself or hisfamily dragged into the incident, declined. Instead, he urged AC not to startany trouble.Crowley called Yorke a coward, unwilling to stand up for truth and decency. Hewas also foolish to think he could hide from the press. If he didn’t rise upindignant, he would only look guilty. No, Crowley decided, he would rather defythe order, stay in Paris, and wind up in prison rather than buckle under andleave. If the government was going to arrest him, they’d have to press chargesand prove he had done something wrong, which he hadn’t. It was a Mexicanstandoff. The story and its newspaper coverage made Crowley a sensation inParis … just the thing to generate brisk sales for Magick.At the time this bombshell fell in Crowley’s lap, he was sick with a cold.Paris’s winter of 1929 was damp, shrouding the countryside with rain, snow, andfrost. A week after the refus de séjour, Crowley was so ill he spent the nextfive days in bed. Owing to illness, authorities allowed him to stay in Franceuntil he recuperated—which, Crowley planned, would not happen until he sawMagick through its publication.Meanwhile Regardie, fingered as an associate of Crowley’s, and Marie, alsolacking a valid carte d’identité, were asked to leave the country. The policetold Marie they were doing her a service by separating her from Crowley. OnMarch 9 Regardie and Marie left for England, only to be refused entry becauseMarie was neither a citizen nor possessed of a visa. Turned back, France deniedthem entry, forcing them to go to Belgium. They arrived in Brussels on March 11.Holed up in a foreign nation, Marie took advantage of the naive Frater Scorpioand seduced him.While Regardie spent the next weeks worrying what Crowley would do when he foundout, Beast was performing sex magick with a woman named Lina “to helpdeM[iramar] out of her trouble.”61[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts061] He spent his remaining timecorrecting proofs of Magick; on April 12 he held an advance copy of the book,his first major publication since the blue Equinox a decade earlier. Crowleyspent his last day in Paris speaking to reporters and being photographed. Heleft France on April 17 satisfied Magick would appear as scheduled.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_077_r1.jpg]Aleister Crowley at the time he left France in 1929. (photo credit 17.3)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c17-fig003a]Paris Midi had company in taking up his story. As he recorded in his diary,“Articles going on by the dozen. Hear that U.S.A. has already had lots of wildfables.”62 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts062] On April 17 the NewYork Times ran the headline “Paris to Expel A. Crowley.” On April 21, ReynoldsIllustrated Newspaper published an interview with Crowley, who expressedbewilderment at his treatment. “There is no accusation against me,” he told thereporter:My sweetheart was expelled.… When she demanded what it was the Frenchauthorities had against me they suggested that I was a trafficker in cocaine.This is ridiculous. Afterwards, they said: “It is not that. Perhaps that is nottrue. It is something else. The real reason is too terrible.”63[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts063]Meanwhile, back in England, John Bull gloated:Soon Hell will be the only place which will have you. You were driven out ofEngland, America deported you and so did Sicily. Now France has given youmarching orders. Since I exposed you for the seducer, devil doctor and debaucheddope fiend that you are, not a decent country will tolerate either you or yoursinister satellites.64 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts064]If Marie could not enter England because she was not a citizen, then thesolution was to make her a citizen. Thus Crowley proposed to marry her. It wassimply a matter of practicality: neither romance nor passion influenced thedecision. He even ignored the I Ching’s May 13 description of his proposedmarriage as “a rash act” (Kwan, hexagram XX), huffing to himself, “I knew that.”Delays crept in, however, as Crowley learned that, to marry in Brussels, heneeded a copy of his divorce papers from Scotland and a translator to renderthem into French. Realizing the requisite papers would take months to collect,Crowley applied, in vain, to the British Consul for permission to bring Marie toEngland on grounds of public morality. Reflecting on his persistent misfortunes,he remarked, “It is like sitting on the Baltoro Glacier waiting for twoconsecutive fine days which never turned up.”65[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts065]The publicity over Crowley’s “expulsion” incited people to deluge Scotland Yard,insisting they arrest Crowley for all the women he killed in France.Lieutenant-Colonel John Filis Carré Carter (1882–1944) of Scotland Yard’sSpecial Branch66 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts066] politelyquestioned young Yorke, knowing his involvement with AC. Yorke insisted Crowleywas not as bad as people made him out to be, and suggested, “Why not bring ACover and put these questions to him yourself?” Carter handed him £10 and said“Bring Crowley to London.”Crowley arrived on June 11 for dinner with Colonel Carter. They apparently gotalong well, for Crowley noted in his diary, “All clear” and thereafter referredto him as “ol’ Nick” and “Saint Nicholas.” Thereafter the two met occasionallyfor dinner.While in London, Crowley visited some of his acquaintances, including GwenOtter, Montgomery Evans II, and linguist Charles Kay Ogden (1889–1957). Observerart critic Paul George Konody (1872–1933) expressed interest in Crowley’s work,encouraging him to paint. Thus when James Cleugh, literary director of theAquila Press, mentioned that the press was for sale, Crowley planned to buy it,turn it into a gallery, and charge artists to exhibit their works. Major RobertThompson Thynne, whom he met at this time, promised to help with the scheme. Andalthough he still planned to sue John Bull, a publishing contract and £50advance from the Mandrake Press distracted him.The Mandrake Press was a small publishing house run by Edward Goldston(1892–1953) and Percy Reginald Stephensen (1901–1965). Goldston was anenterprising businessman who went from working in the Oriental department ofKegan Paul, Trench, Trübner and Company to running his own rare bookstore andpublishing house on Museum Street. Both his clients and his books were rich—in1925, for instance, he bought and sold the vellum Melk monastery copy of theGutenberg Bible—and Goldston shrewdly reinvested his profits into other privatepresses. Jack Lindsay (1900–1990), who sought a publisher for D. H. Lawrence’sartwork, united Goldston with Stephensen to form the Mandrake Press. Stephensen,an Australian nicknamed Inky, wasa thin and immensely energetic young man, with a sandy moustache, fierce, keeneyes and a quick, nervous manner. He was a Rhodes scholar at Oxford, where hisviews were rarely exactly coincident with those of the university authorities.67[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts067]In his school days, he had been a staunch defender of Communism. He latermarried but continued to spearhead various causes. In his native Australia heoperated for a time the Fanfrolico Press, and this background made him an idealbusiness partner for Goldston.Mandrake made a big splash by publishing and exhibiting Lawrence’s paintings attheir 41 Museum Street offices: the authorities had already suppressed his LadyChatterley’s Lover, and after newspapers attacked the exhibition, the policeraided the show and seized any artworks that showed pubic hair orgenitalia—about half the pieces. The final trial, held on August 8, ended withMandrake returning the paintings, stopping the exhibition, and destroying thebooks; however, no charges were pressed. Although losing Lawrence’s book struckthe small press hard, it also gave Mandrake a sensational launch. Through thepublicity, Mandrake signed twenty new titles between June and August.Stephensen, in the midst of a battle against censorship, was eager to take on adark horse like Crowley. A controversial figure whose theories of sexualliberation were sure to outrage the prudes who attacked the Lawrence exhibit wasjust what he wanted. The press offered to publish The Stratagem and OtherStories and talked of exhibiting his paintings. On June 28, AC signed a contractand received his £50 advance. He would use it to rent a cottage in Knockholt,Kent, which he would occupy that fall. Stephensen had found it for him; it wasthirty miles south of London and separated from Stephensen’s own weekend placeby a household of elderly spinsters.Telegrams were usually bad news, and the July 19 cable from Marie was noexception: she and Regardie were forced to leave Brussels. Crowley called on theGermers, who had returned to Berlin on July 4, and they met Marie the next day,taking her to Leipzig, where Sister Martha Küntzel put her up. Realizing thesituation had become untenable, Crowley on July 24 signed a power of attorneyallowing Yorke to conduct business for him. He also signed another contract withMandrake to bring out Moonchild, Golden Twigs, his autobiography, and a criticaltreatment of Crowley’s work. Then he left for Leipzig, fetched Marie, and madewedding plans. Crowley hoped that as a married person he could bring Lulu toEngland and legally adopt her. On August 16, 1929, at 11:20 a.m., Marie Teresade Miramar became Mrs. Aleister Crowley in a ceremony before the British consulin Germany. That evening they left for London, arriving the following night. “Noone to meet us,” AC lamented.Returning to work brought new problems. One of them emerged from Crowley’s visitto Germany, where he permitted Birven, who was publishing the magical magazineHain der Isis, to serialize a German translation of parts of Magick, as well theentirety of his article “The Psychology of Hashish” … in violation of hisMandrake contract. Meanwhile, Yorke, Goldston, and Stephensen all agreed thatCrowley needed to change the names of Moonchild’s characters, which AC hadmodeled after real-world people such as Yeats, Mathers, and Desti, before theycould publish it. Finally, on August 29, Crowley instructed Lecram Press to sendthe copies of Magick to Mandrake for distribution; however, December wouldarrive before the books.Nevertheless, Mandrake soon released new Crowley titles. The Stratagem and OtherStories came out September 10, followed on September 25 by Moonchild, whichboasted a dust jacket by artist Beresford Egan (1905–1984). Mandrake alsoreleased another book of lesser interest to the Crowley corpus: not only didMerry Go Down by Rab Noolas contain poetry by Victor Neuburg but Noolas was apseudonym for Philip Heseltine, better known as Peter Warlock (1894–1930). Hewas one of Stephensen’s drinking buddies who had helped with the FanfrolicoPress.The public eye also beheld Crowley in Betty May’s biography, Tiger Woman: MyStory. Published by Duckworth in 1929, it identified Crowley only as “TheMystic,” painting a kind picture of him. Most significantly, the book statedthat Raoul died not from drinking cat’s blood during a ritual but fromcontaminated water. When he lunched with Duckworth’s representative AnthonyPowell (1905–2000) one afternoon, Crowley complained just a bit about TigerWoman, his main gripe being the hard life of a magician. Powell would model Dr.Trelawney of his acclaimed twelve-volume novel sequence Dance to the Music ofTime (1951–1975) after Crowley.On October 9, Crowley moved to Ivy Cottage in Knockholt, Kent. He quickly becamepopular among the locals and could be seen walking down the streets in hiswinter jacket and scarf, bellowing old sailor’s songs. Stephensen visited often,playing chess and rummaging through Crowley’s room full of books, manuscripts,and press cuttings. It was here that Stephensen put aside his autobiographicalnovel Clean Earth to write a defense of the Beast, The Legend of AleisterCrowley. He hoped such a book, issued cheaply to sell, would promote sales offorthcoming books by Mandrake’s star author.Marie, meanwhile, became difficult. The new Mrs. Crowley drank heavily, and hersuspicious nature blossomed into rabid paranoia. The day before their move toKnockholt, she had made a scene; then, the day after they moved, Crowleyrecorded in his diary that Marie “had several bad attacks of delusion.” Two dayslater, during Crowley’s fifty-fourth birthday party with the Germers andStephensens, “Marie relapsed badly in P.M. & there was a most nerve-wrackingscene.”68 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts068] When, shortlythereafter, Marie worsened and began having fainting spells, Crowley sent her toa nursing home. “Seven hours’ rest worked wonders,” he noted.69[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts069] Crowley’s luck with women wasagain showing.Regardless, that October was important as the press got hold of Crowley’s newestbooks. While the Birmingham Post panned The Stratagem and Other Stories,Moonchild met with mixed reviews. The Aberdeen Press and Journal called it “oneof the most extraordinarily fantastic yet attractive novels we have read,”70[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts070] while the New Statesmanexpressed perplexity, writing, “Possibly the author may know what this nonsenseis all about.”71 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts071] Finally, theNew Age slammed its sensational jacket blurb:I had no idea that Mr. Crowley was one of the “most mysterious” of livingwriters, or even that he was mysterious. What does it mean, anyway? That hewrites mystery novels? That it is a mystery why he writes novels? That no oneknows who he is? Or what?72 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c17-nts072]Mandrake also released Crowley’s autobiography. Although the author titled itThe Spirit of Solitude, Stephensen “re-antichristened” it The Confessions ofAleister Crowley after St. Augustine’s autohagiography. It was so long thatMandrake planned to issue it in six volumes. The October 1929 invoice for volumeone cited printing costs of £167. The book was handsome, bound in oversize whitebuckram, and sold for two guineas.Unfortunately, October 1929 was the worst possible month to release expensive,privately printed books, for the stock market crash on Black Friday, October 28,meant slow book sales. Furthermore, the Germers lost a lot of money on the stockmarket, making support of Crowley more difficult.Stephensen attributed the difficulty in selling Crowley’s books to hisanonymity, which exceeded his notoriety. Since Mandrake had such success withits D. H. Lawrence exhibition, he planned to show Crowley’s artworks. WhenGoldston skeptically refused to fund the exhibit, Crowley’s people paid to shipand frame his paintings with reimbursement from Mandrake pending a successfulshow. On Friday, November 1, starting at 10 a.m., the public could pay £1 to seeAC’s artwork at the Mandrake offices. With many of Crowley’s works remainingsoiled and unframed, it was disappointing and, unlike the Lawrence exhibit,generated no interest.Goldston, convinced of Stephensen’s folly, finally closed the Mandrake officesfor the winter. Among Mandrake’s last official actions that December werereleasing Volume Two of the Confessions, working on Volume Three, andtransferring three thousand unbound copies of Magick in Theory and Practice toEngland for distribution. This last book was supposed to bear a talisman on itscover, but no engraver would take on so ignominious a task; but the fourpaperbound volumes did include a color plate reproducing the talisman."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTEENBEAST BITES BACKWhen the Oxford University Poetry Society invited Crowley to speak at theuniversity, AC hesitated at first. Nearly two decades earlier, the dons hadbanned his lectures at Cambridge; since then, his name had fallen into suchdisrepute that public opinion made him into a devil-worshiping madman, in muchthe same way that wealthy French baron Gilles de Rais (1404–1440) had beenaccused, tried, and executed on the extraordinary charges of satanism,kidnapping, and killing and eating six hundred children. Whether he was a serialkiller or victim of witchcraft hysteria is debated to this day. Identifying withthe idea of a falsely accused magician, AC accepted the invitation, telling clubsecretary (and future novelist) Arthur Calder-Marshall (1908–1992) that he wouldbe lecturing on Gilles de Rais.Alas, history repeated itself. When Oxford’s chaplain, Father Ronald ArbuthnottKnox (1888–1957),1 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts001] learned ofthe impending lecture by that notorious black magician Aleister Crowley—at whosedebased Abbey Oxford student Raoul Loveday had died—he canceled the talk. ThePoetry Society defiantly rented an off-campus room, planning to shuttle studentsto and from the lecture by bus, but Knox threatened to expel any students whoattended the talk. Poetry Society secretary Hugh Speaight, remembered as verysophisticated and well-schooled in contemporary arts,2[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts002] hoped to become a Dominicanmonk and was thus beaten just as Mudd had been twenty years earlier. He sent arueful cancellation to Crowley on January 30, 1930:Dear Mr. Crowley:I am writing to tell you that we have been unfortunately forced to cancel nextMonday’s meeting of the Poetry Society. It has come to our knowledge that ifyour proposed paper is delivered disciplinary action will be taken involving notonly myself but the rest of the Committee of the Society. In these circumstancesyou will, I trust, understand why we have had to cancel the meeting. I feel Imust apologize to you for the trouble I have caused you. I must confess that Ihad credited the University with more tolerance—or at any rate with a greatersense of humour.3 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts003]This must have been a bitter pill for Speaight, who, in his book of Catholicmeditations published the previous year, wrote, “censorship provides the sinnerwith one of his rare chances of winning a dream of martyrdom.”4[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts004][images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_078_r1.jpg]Oxford University Poetry Society secretary Hugh Speaight. (photo credit 18.1)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c18-fig001a]Crowley refused to give in this time, and decided to make his lecture availableto Oxford students even if he was forbidden to speak it. On February 1 he wroteto Stephensen:I authorize you to take whatever steps you consider advisable to secure thepublication of “The Banned Lecture” on the 3rd of February of the present year.5[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts005]Stephensen—a notorious Oxford alumnus because of his Communist views—ralliedbehind Crowley and arranged to typeset and print Crowley’s lecture on the dateof his proposed talk.Tremendous hype greeted February 3. In the pages of local papers like the OxfordMail, Daily Sketch, Birmingham Post, Birmingham Gazette, Manchester EveningChronicle, Manchester Guardian, Daily News, and Darlington Northern Echo,Crowley fumed to reporters, “I challenge anyone to show why I should not lecturein Oxford today. There is some underhand business behind this”; after anexasperated pause, he smiled. “The authorities are afraid that I may kill andeat eight hundred Oxford undergraduates.”6[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts006] Students with sandwich boardsmarched along Oxford’s High Street, announcing that copies of Crowley’sforbidden speech would go on sale tomorrow. Consequently, various rumors spreadaround the campus: that Calder-Marshall and Speaight were trying to form acoven; or that Father Knox had refused Speaight Communion in church for invitingCrowley.7 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts007] Thus The BannedLecture enjoyed brisk sales, with curious students who would otherwise neverhave attended the talk paying sixpence to see what all the fuss was about.Believing the current economy could not support a small press, and with Goldstongetting cold feet, Stephensen began seeking a prospective buyer for Mandrake. Hesuggested that Yorke and Germer begin a financial syndicate to produce and sellCrowley’s books. The proposal was ambitious: Germer and Yorke would acquireMandrake and rename it the Thelema Bookshop and Publishing Co. Ltd. They plannedto release The Vision and the Voice, Liber Aleph, the comment on The Book of theLaw, 100 Short Poems, Simple Simon (his Simon Iff short stories in two volumes),Golden Twigs (his Frazer-inspired short stories), The Legend of AleisterCrowley, Collected Short Stories, and the Hopfer color edition of 777. Alas,they lacked the capital for so large a venture.Thus they chose the cheaper option, to take over the press as a limitedliability company. Germer and Yorke negotiated a loan from Cora Germer, forwhich Yorke agreed to take out a life insurance policy should he die beforerepaying her.8 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts008] Then Yorkecontributed £1,000, Major Thynne £1,000, and Germer £500, to form Mandrake PressLtd. Painter, surgeon, and psychoanalyst Grace Winifred Pailthorpe (1883-1971)also put in £200 to £300 in exchange for publication of her Freudian book, WhatWe Put in Prison.9 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts009] Goldstonhappily relinquished the floundering press on March 28. Yorke, Stephensen,Thynne, and Thynne’s associate, Major J. C. S. McAllan, formed the board ofdirectors, and Regardie became bookkeeper.While Yorke and the others organized business that April, Crowley visitedGermany. He planned a fall exhibit of his paintings in Berlin; met with severalOTO members, including Henri Birven, whose Hain der Isis had debuted thatJanuary;10 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts010] and befriendedHanni Larissa Jaeger, a nineteen-year-old spitfire who shared Crowley’s interestin painting.11 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts011]When Germer got his license at the end of the month, he took Crowley for adrive, only to overturn the car into a ditch. In his diary, Crowley humorouslyrecorded the incident:What I said during yesterday’s accident. (1) “Ease her up!” He didn’t: so (2)“Are you mad?” He was: so (3) “Take care of the glass.” (4) “Let me lowermyself, so that you can get out.”12[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts012]When Maria joined him in Berlin, he took her shopping for birthday presents;when she treated him to another drunken row that evening, Crowley sent her backto Leipzig and, on May 5, returned himself to London.That May, the Mandrake Press Ltd. put out its first and only catalog. Itincluded Mandrake’s backlist along with some twenty proposed titles, only a fewof which ever appeared. In the following months, however, they did publish abroad range of titles: a translation of Gustave Flaubert’s Salammbô; D. H.Lawrence’s posthumous A Propos of Lady Chatterley’s Lover; and Liam O’Flaherty’s(1896–1984) The Ecstasy of Angus. Although finely produced, the books generatedlittle interest.On top of slow sales, Crowley’s constant presence in the office was a nuisance.He was suing Goldston for the promised but unpaid reimbursement for the cost ofshipping his paintings to London for the Mandrake exhibit (an act that severedGoldston entirely from the press and ensured that the third and future volumesof The Confessions would never appear). He was also attempting to ply another£500 from Cora Germer to purchase the Aquila Press, a venture he eventuallyabandoned. Plus, his many comments on the ongoing typesetting of volume three ofThe Confessions and the upcoming Legend of Aleister Crowley made Stephensenbelieve Crowley was trying to prevent the books from appearing. Stephensenfinally insisted that Crowley keep out of the offices and to cease extortingmoney out of his supporters.I want absolute carte blanche for Mandrake Press Ltd. to go ahead publishing, asand how I think fit, in consultation with Thynne & Yorke. I want you to regardMandrake Press Ltd. solely as your publishers, and not to prejudice the purelycommercial side of that purely publishing concern with any of your fits andstarts, Thelemite politics, earthquakes, and the other distracting phenomena ofart and nature, such as pin pricks, dogmatism, human chess, brawls, faux pas,bravado and braggadocio, pure bluff, brainwaves, and dementia precox, which tendto accompany your too personal intrusion into the world of practical affairs.13[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts013]Despite his joking tone, Stephensen was firm.So Crowley kicked back with a copy of the finished proofs to volume three of hisautobiography, enjoying the £500 he decided not to spend on the Aquila Press.When Yorke encouraged him to economize, Crowley made a diary entry in hisinimitable manner:Yorke niggling again, that one must cut one’s coat in accordance with one’scloth; whereas the meanest tailor knows that one must cut one’s cloth inaccordance with the size of the man.14[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts014]Crowley was doubtless full of himself because Mandrake was finally releasing TheLegend of Aleister Crowley.Although it was ready as early as October, Goldston delayed its publication.When the blue paperback finally appeared, the printer suppressed the “EpistleDedicatory to James Douglas (editor of the Sunday Express)” for fear of libel;its tone was most unfriendly:Investigation reveals that you had neither a sense of responsibility nor a senseof shame nor any substantial reason for attacking Crowley except your ownsquamous vanity. You had called for the suppression of his book in accents whichare more familiar now days than they then were. You followed up this clamourwith a campaign of personal vilification more severe than anything of its kindwhich has yet disgraced even modern gutter journalism.15[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts015]Interestingly enough, Crowley’s old chela Victor Neuburg reviewed the book anddefended Crowley in the August 24 Freethinker:although in some respects he was perhaps “not quite nice to know,” as the slangphrase goes, we do not think that it is quite fair to charge him with murder,cannibalism, black magical practices, moral aberrations, treachery, druggery; asis the custom amongst the cunninger and more degraded jackals of FleetStreet … Crowley is at least as important a figure as the late D. H. Lawrenceand Mr. James Joyce, both unquestionably men of genius; and when we remember thekind of thing said about these artists in our cheaper prints, we hesitate toacquiesce in the Sunday Newspaper verdict on Aleister Crowley.16[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts016]Crowley had been trying to exhibit his paintings in London; a jobber namedHanchant tried to arrange an exhibit at Aquila, but that fell through with thepurchase deal. When Crowley turned his hotel room into a gallery, his landlordevicted him. Thus Crowley packed 160 of his paintings and drawings for Berlin,where he hoped for a better reception. “Miss Jaeger fucks every one farewells,”Crowley recorded on his departure from London on August 1. His bon voyage partywas quite an affair, with “Marie drunk and vomiting all day.”17[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts017]He arrived in Berlin on August 2 and relegated his alcoholic wife to history,writing to Maria that he wanted nothing to do with her until she stoppeddrinking. (Yorke meanwhile sent her off to Hampstead.) AC renamed lusciousFräulein Jaeger as the Monster (he also gave her the magical name Anu) and beganpracticing sex magick with her. Germer, in his reckless manner, motored themabout Germany, including a visit to his therapist, Austrian psychoanalyst AlfredAdler (1870–1937), whom Crowley claimed to have helped with his patients.Regarding psychology, Crowley wrote,There are only three authors on the subject worth reading, the original Freud,Adler and Jung. Freud is completely obsessed with the nonsense about infantilesexual theories. There may possibly be children in Germany or Austriasufficiently morbid, but nothing of the sort ever crossed my own mind when I wasa child—nor have I ever met a child so morbid. Jung appears to me to have goneoff the rails by his innate incurable romanticism. To my mind, the best of thethree is Adler, whom, of course, I know personally; with him I did actually workwhen I was in Berlin. He could only come up from Vienna for a fortnight everyyear, and I handled some of his patients in his absence.18[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts018]Crowley took a manuscript from Adler for Mandrake to publish, thinking it wouldbe a boon for the troubled press whose greatest asset, D. H. Lawrence, had justdied; alas, Mandrake never managed to publish it.Another notable contact at this time was with writer and critic Aldous Huxley(1894–1963). Although best known for Brave New World (1932), his The Doors ofPerception (1954) would serve almost as a manifesto for the psychedelicrevolution of the 1960s. He was already an established writer when he andCrowley met. One can only imagine what they discussed, although on the heels oftheir meeting Crowley wrote to Regardie,Please send a copy of Clouds without Water to Aldous Huxley Esq., AthenaeumClub, Pall Mall (with prospectuses etc.) with my compliments—we had a gorgeous 3days with him in Berlin. Also please set up a figure [astrological chart] forhim. Godalming, 4 A.M., July 26 ’94.19[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts019]Mandrake had fallen on bad times, and Crowley’s absence brought proof correctionand other business to a standstill. Owing £2,000 and sitting on £4,000 worth ofunsold stock, Mandrake was in no position to repay its creditors. Stephensen,convinced that Thynne and Crowley were both diverting funds into their ownpockets, left the business: Packing up the page proofs for The ConfessionsVolume Three and Golden Twigs, he retreated to his little village in Kent andleft Mandrake to its fate. He soon returned to Australia and set up the EndeavorPress with Norman Lindsay.Mandrake would go into voluntary liquidation that winter, and ultimatelycollapse from lack of capital a year after Stephensen’s departure. AlthoughGrace Pailthorpe lost her investment in the press, she harbored no hardfeelings; when What We Put in Prison and in Preventive and Rescue Homes debutedin 1932, she mentioned Mandrake in the dedication. This book gained herworldwide acclaim and prompted the psychological treatment of criminals.In the midst of Mandrake’s struggle, Crowley was, as Yorke put it, “up to somestunt in Portugal.”20 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts020] Hisscheme was to travel round the world with Fraulein Jaeger on a shoestringbudget, writing a travelogue. AC detailed the plans in a letter to biographerand poet Herbert Gorman (1893–1954):The Monster & I have started to go round the world on £14.10.10. The questionhas arisen as to whether we shall not need some more between Lisbon, Madera, RioMonte Video, Buenos Aries, Volparaiso, the Galapagos Isl (where the turtles comefrom), the South Seas, China, India, &c, &c, &c & London.Style: as Confessions, but more cynical & romantic.So cable me a contract from one of your millionaire papers to write it all up.21[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts021]The steamship Alcantara carried them to Lisbon, where poet Fernando Pessoa(1888–1935) greeted them at the dock on September 2, 1930. Like Crowley, Pessoafound inspiration for his poems—like “Nirvana” (1906) and “The Circle” (1907)—inmediums, kabbalah, Rosicrucians, Theosophy, magic, and mysticism. He had ordereda copy of 777 from a London book dealer in 1917, and in November 1929 contactedMandrake Press to purchase the Confessions. When Pessoa identified an error inthe Confessions in Crowley’s natal chart and notified the press in a letterdated December 4, 1929, it prompted a personal reply from Crowley. Thus begantheir correspondence. Pessoa would even translate “Hymn to Pan” into Portugueseto include in his Presença 33 (1931). Crowley called him “a really good poet,the only man who has ever written Shakespearean Sonnets in the manner ofShakespeare. It is about the most remarkable literary phenomena in myexperience.”22 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts022]The wayfarers took a room at the Hotel de l’Europe. They bathed in the sea atEstoril beach, walked along the shore, and enjoyed the sights. One of these wasthe Boca de Inferno, or Mouth of Hell, in Cascaes, twenty-three miles fromLisbon. The fantastic rocks of this ravine leading out to sea, jutting straightup from the mouth of the Tagus, had been hollowed out by the waves. It soimpressed Crowley that he wrote in his diary, “I wish the west coast of Scotlandcould see it.”As they traveled, Crowley also trained the Monster to become his next ScarletWoman. Although she easily saw astral visions with the help of drugs, theydisturbed and frightened her. On September 16 she used alcohol during a ritualfor success in some moneymaking scheme: when she saw visions, she began sobbingand became hysterical; then said she was sick of magick and wanted to killherself. In the end, the manager interrupted the incident and ordered them toleave the hotel.Moving to Estoril the next day, Hanni seemed better; however, as Crowley bookeda room for them, she vanished. He searched the area, recording in his diary,“There is no news of her yet—6 p.m.” The next day, with still no word, he noted:“Worrying like the devil.” The next day, September 19, he resolved: “I am notgoing to get over this—unless she comes back.” He found her later that day inLisbon, where the American Consul advised her to go home. Crowley—seeing bothhis romance and travelogue crumbling—asked her to reconsider. Although shereturned with him that evening, she sailed for Germany early the next morning.Finding himself alone, Crowley vented his frustration in a letter to Maria, whocomplained that he did not visit during his last trip to London.Dear Maria,I did not ring you up when I passed through London because you answered my veryserious letter with the most trivial everyday nonsense.Also you have been trying to seduce Israel Regardie and I know not who else. Itis galling to my pride that some say you failed!Anyhow, you had better get a man who will stand for your secret drinking andyour scandalous behavior. I gave you a great chance in life, and you threw itaway. Tant pis!23 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts023]You should get a divorce. I admit what some dithering nincompoops are stillimbecile enough to call “misconduct” on 47 occasions since August 3rd—thefatigue of constant travel must excuse the smallness of the figure—with HanniJaeger of Berlin.It will be no good asking for alimony because we are all in the soup togetherwith the Rt. Hon. Lord Beaverbrook and the British Empire. Best of all to you!24[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts024]Crowley stuffed the letter into an envelope and set out on a walk. Passing theastonishing Mouth of Hell, inspiration struck.On September 23 at 6:36 p.m., the moment of the autumnal equinox, he left acryptic note at Boca de Inferno, weighted down by his cigarette case:L.G.P.I cannot live without you. The other “Boca de Inferno” will get me—it will notbe so hot as yours!Hjsos!TuLiYuThe signature was a joke on Crowley’s part: toodle-oo. (Pessoa would explain tothe press that this was one of Crowley’s previous incarnations, a Chinese sagewho lived some three thousand years before Christ; but he may well have beenperpetuating the joke.) The next day, Crowley received a note from Hanni. Itcontained only one sentence, yet said everything: “Love is the law, love underwill.” Crowley quietly left Portugal on September 24 to rendezvous with hislover in Germany.Meanwhile, Pessoa (according to plan) told the press that his friend AleisterCrowley had disappeared. When journalist Ferreira Gomes found the note at Hell’sMouth the next day, the Diario de Noticias and Noticias Illustrado carried thestory of Crowley’s mysterious disappearance. Papers throughout Europe quicklypicked it up, including the French magazine Détective, which ran a large articletitled “L’énigme de la Bouche d’Enfer” [“The Mystery of the Mouth of Hell”]. TheNew York Herald, Paris ran a photo of two silhouettes looking out at the seafrom Boca de Inferno; although the figures are unidentified, they are Crowleyand Hanni, photographed by the Beast’s friend, writer Herbert Gorman(1893–1954). However, British censors delayed the stories pending furtherinformation. Many papers nevertheless carried the news as it broke, helpingspread rumors that Crowley had been murdered, perhaps by a fanatic Catholicpriest.The case became even more mysterious when Portuguese officials stated that,according to their records, Crowley had left the country on September 23.Pessoa, however, insisted that he saw Aleister Crowley on the 23rd and twice onthe 24th. Thus, either Crowley left Portugal on the 23rd and returned the nextday, or there were two Crowleys, one who left Portugal and another who committedsuicide. “Famous Mystic or His?” ran a headline in the Empire News. The plotthickened when rumor had it that police raided Crowley’s posh Berlinheadquarters, finding information on a Soviet plan for world domination,suggesting Crowley was a wealthy secret agent who had run afoul.AC, who kept a low profile in Germany as the drama of his disappearanceunfolded, instructed Thynne and Yorke to milk this for all it was worth. Hannihad Regardie set up a bogus seance with Alfred Vout Peters (1867–1934), thewell-known London clairvoyant and trance medium who had attempted to contact therecently departed Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859–1930). “Students of magick shouldavoid all spiritualists as they should avoid syphilis,” Crowley warned Regardie;it was a double entendre, referring not only to mediums but also to theSerpent’s bout with venereal disease. On October 14, the Oxford Mail announcedthe seance to reach Crowley’s spirit. The Doyle Medium Jest, as Crowley calledit, began with a slow description of Crowley’s visit to Lisbon; eventually,Peters described Crowley’s walk in the countryside, where he stopped by Boca deInferno. Suddenly, he was pushed from behind. By whom? His enemies: either RomanCatholics or Freemasons. The body, Peters claimed, would never be found.Regardie’s management of the stunt and its ensuing publicity so pleased Hannithat she told Crowley, “Wait till I get to London. I’ll fuck that bastardsilly.”25 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts025]In order to milk money out of the publicity, Crowley pseudonymously sent thefollowing letter to Anthony Powell at Duckworth:My dear Powell,I am the beautiful German girl for whose love the infamous Aleister Crowleycommitted suicide.Posing as Hanni, AC offered to sell the manuscript of My Hymen, theeighty-thousand-word story of their elopement, for a £500 advance on a fifteenpercent royalty. Although this was the same deal they gave Betty May for herbiography Tiger Woman, they declined the offer.While Crowley traipsed across the continent with Hanni Jaeger, Yorke fumed inLondon. He thought Crowley irresponsible for leaving Marie penniless and beggingYorke for help. “If that woman starves, you can be sent to prison for notkeeping her since you married her,” Yorke threatened him at one time;26[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts026] later, he wrote withexasperation, “You are a callous old sinner at times.”27[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts027] The two argued passionatelyabout Marie, Yorke insisting that Crowley live up to his responsibility and ACaccusing Yorke of sleeping with his wife. Twas to no avail.Yorke ultimately resigned himself to accepting Crowley’s vagaries and tomaintaining a distance from him. In a note to himself, he wrote:It is a curious world. I cannot stand for A.C.’s behaviour in leaving Mariewithout a bean and refusing to support her. I cannot stand for his wasting otherpeople’s money the way he does, or for his taking money for one purpose andusing it for another. In his own mind of course he so associates himself withthe work that he thinks money spent on himself as money spent on the work.Possible theoretically, but won’t go down in practice. I cannot sincerely pullwith him in that side of his work. Yet I am heart and soul in the movement. Isee his actions as endangering the movement. Practically he has still to provehis point. Up till now his method has only led from one mess to another. It isup to him to prove his way. Meanwhile my best way to help the world is quietlyto do my best to prepare what I consider a decent solid foundation … But Icannot work with A.C. in the way he would like as I sincerely disapprove of hismethod.28 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts028]Yorke ultimately became a distant but staunch advocate of Crowley, supportinghis work without becoming involved in it. Developing an interest in Buddhism,much of his attention would go to the Dalai Lama, serving as his spokesman andpublishing his books.Thinking it was better for Marie to receive a token amount than for Crowley toface charges of not supporting her, Yorke paid her an allowance from thepublication fund, over which Crowley had given him power of attorney. Yorke paidher £60 by the time he received a telegram from Crowley, asking for thepublication fund money to help with his stunt. In response, Yorke wired back,“Tell 666 there are two of them. They both bounce.” Or, in vernacular, “Balls.”Incensed, Crowley revoked Yorke’s power of attorney and placed Regardie incharge. Thus, AC cast off the rich boy from Gloucestershire.Knowing only £30 remained in the account, Yorke advised the bank to acceptRegardie’s signature but warned that he would not be responsible for overdrawnchecks. He contends Regardie used the money on himself.29[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts029] Per Crowley’s instructions,Yorke then gave the diaries, books, photos, and other materials he had beenstoring to Crowley’s solicitor, Isidore Kerman (1905–1998).30[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts030] The only thing keeping Yorkefrom resigning his trusteeship was the fact that legal costs would come from thefund; as much as he wanted to sever business ties with Beast, he knew Crowleyneeded the money.AC seemed to be owning up to his responsibility when he offered Marie a portionof his trust payment. Since the law required Crowley to send the money to herhimself, Yorke sent him the balance of their storage settlement on October 25,assuming this money would go to Marie. However, Crowley spent it all. Yorkecould bear no more. In frustration, he suspended his financial dealings withCrowley. “You are funny when you propose disassociating yourself from mattersout of which you have been chucked,” AC responded. “You will do more wisely toask rehabilitation in a chastened spirit.”31[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts031]Life with Hanni Jaeger continued to be as stormy and intense as ever. Whenharmonious, it left Crowley in emotional and sexual bliss. But when theyclashed, it was fierce: she often moved out for the night, only to return thenext day. Further complicating things were her profound mood swings, bizarrebehavior, and physical symptoms that always subsided long enough for her toseduce him. Thus, when Hanni complained of abdominal pains after Halloween,Crowley found it difficult to take her seriously. When a man called to say Hanniwas in the hospital and would not be home that night, Crowley assumed she hadsimply found someone else with whom to sleep. He was alarmed to discover she wastruly in the hospital with kidney trouble. Despite her illness, constantseductions of Crowley—and just as many rows—studded Hanni’s return home. Some ofCrowley’s diary entries from this period are illuminating:November 22, 1930. She is violently excited all day—sexually & otherwise. Severemelancholic & erotic outbursts. There is absolutely no reason for any nervousupset of any kind; but she changes from mood to mood in the most sudden way.This attack is more prolonged & severe than any I have observed so far. And itis more than usually causeless. She ended by wanting to go out; when I objected,pretended to ring up the police—a too familiar trick. She then calmed down, & atlast woke up into an infantile state. I undressed her, & put her to bed in mypyjamas. In short, every possible phase—She has now called me in, to listen tohallucinations, real or no; e.g. “I don’t want you to go away behind the tree.”December 16, 1930. One of her sadistic tricks is to make herself sufferphysically from starvation, cold etc. in order to make me suffer from sympathy.E.g. she will ask for something she obviously needs (& could take withoutasking) & when supplied (as of course) she refuses it with violent rage, & thenmoans & screams because she hasn’t got it.Crowley summed up their antipathy by writing: “I love her. I’ve thought ofnothing else all day. I’ve even abused her to have an excuse to talk abouther!”32 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts032]They fought again two days before Christmas, and she again moved out. Depressed,Crowley dreamed of her on Christmas Eve and went home early from Christmasdinner with the Germers, hoping she might call. She did not. When, on boxingday, he found her at Romanisches Café (one of Berlin’s great coffeehouses), sheclaimed she had purchased a gift for him, but the waiter had lost or stolen it.Then she told Crowley of her plans “to stop eating, prostitute herself to getmoney for cigarettes & brandy & to hire a room with gas & a hot bath to open herveins in.”33 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts033] Two days latershe was again herself, but the magic was gone. Their rituals soon trailed off,she moved out, and they both moved on. When Crowley became sick in January 1931,he likened his intestinal difficulties to his soul’s purging of Hanni LarissaJaeger.Crowley later heard that the Monster had killed herself shortly after theyparted.34 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts034] However, atwenty-one-year-old Hanni Jaeger arrived in New York from Hamburg in late1931.35 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts035] It is entirelypossible that Crowley (along with his biographers) was tricked by her ownversion of the suicide stunt.Yorke continued urging Crowley to deal honorably with his wife by writing:I gave Maria dinner the other night, and found her in a very bad way. Rent ispaid up to the end of the month, but she is very short of food, and in a badnervous condition, talking to everyone of suicide. Her genuine attempts to findwork have met with very little success. She got one regular job, but lost itthrough being your wife when John Bull attacked you and the Mandrake Press earlyin January.… I tell her that from your letters to me you appear to want to treather decently and to make some allowance—you know she is not extravagant. But inpractice she receives nothing, and one cannot blame her for suspecting you ofprevarication.36 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts036]Given Crowley’s continued inaction, Marie finally sued for support in MarelybonePolice Court. Crowley responded by advising his solicitor of Marie’s drunkenscenes and paranoid outbursts. But as Regardie made brutally clear:Monster’s note about it being much better for the Great Work if you wereplaintiff is perfectly true. It is too bad that that wasn’t thought of severalmonths ago when Maria received your letter stating that you had committedadultery umpteen times and that only the rigours of travelling prevented thenumber being greater. The letter must have caused you a great deal of pleasurewhen written, but, alas, it prevents you even thinking of being plaintiff fordivorce now. One can’t have things both ways.37[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts037]Before the case ever came to court, Marie lost her resolve and wrote to Yorke:Alas everything is cruel to me. When you get this letter, I am died. I leavethis world without regret, because I know that now I go for ever take a dearrest. Please write after to Crowley that in my last moment I could not forgivehim. Farewell.38 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts038]On February 28, 1931, Marie also wrote to Colonel Carter, “Nobody is responsibleof my suicide only Aleister Crowley.”39[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts039] Carter had previously advisedCrowley, “I suggest that you had better cease knocking around the continent andcome back to your wife at once or you will be getting yourself into serioustrouble.…”40 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts040] Now he warnedYorke that Crowley could get two years in prison for wife desertion.Marie soon disappeared. She drifted to the Embankment, eventually winding up ina workhouse where she was certified insane and committed to Colney Hatch Asylumnear Southgate—the same place, ironically, that Rose went with alcoholicdementia. Because she was certified, Crowley could not sue for divorce. Mariabecame case number 23112, suffering from delusions that she was married to theGreat Beast 666, was the daughter of the King and Queen of England, and that shemarried her brother, the Prince of Wales. When Yorke visited Marie later in1931, he showed her doctor, to his great surprise, one of Crowley’s callingcards, which identified him as the Great Beast 666.The Great Work of 1931 revolved around planning an exhibit of Crowley’spaintings. Crowley was in touch with Karl Nierendorf (1889–1947), a Germandealer and promoter of modern art.41[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts041] Nierendorf claimed only threeother painters could be classed with Crowley, and believed the public would paytwenty-five thousand reichsmarks per painting. He offered to show the paintingsat his Porza Gallery in Berlin. As Yorke and Hanchant shipped the paintings fora planned February showing, Crowley wrote excitedly, “The great Nierendorf isshowing my pictures (Time will show whether this is a practical joke on Europeor on me).”42 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts042]The joke, it turns out, was on Crowley. On February 11 the exhibit waspostponed. Undaunted, Crowley spent the next months painting hard and organizingthe framing and storage of his works until the rescheduled exhibit. Many ofthose whom he sampled as potential Scarlet Women that spring and summer servedas models, but none of them fit the bill as Whore of Babalon. Despite continuedbouts with cold, asthma, and other ailments, Crowley’s search for a sexualpartner continued.On August 1, feeling sidetracked by his recent romances and painting, Crowleydid a ritual to get back on track with his prophetic mission. His partner inthis act of sex magick was Pola Henckels; of all his lovers at this time,Crowley noted she “may possibly be the one.”43[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts043] The ritual felt potent, andconvinced him that they’d generated a new current.Two days later, he met Bertha Busch.Crowley went walking on Monday, August 3. He saw Adlon and Bristol that morningand, at half-past noon, paused at the window of a travel agency on Unter denLinden. The woman who’d been watching him seized the opportunity to step forwardand speak. “Where are you going for your next trip?” He turned and faced thebeautiful thirty-six-year-old redhead who was trying to pick him up. Althoughher name was Bertha Busch, she preferred “Billie.” And although Crowley wastwenty years older, age did not dissuade her.Within three days, Crowley performed his first sex magical ritual with her. “Ilove Billie passionately & truly—& I must avoid her,” he soon wrote in hisdiary. “She might return my love.”44[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts044] His words were prophetic, forhe was soon bedridden with bronchial asthma; Billie came to his side, dubbed himher “Darling Boy,” and nursed him to health. On August 29, Crowley introducedBillie to the Germers over dinner. Karl, who had been growing more eccentricwith each passing month, explained “everything about Danish Butter to the amazedadmiration of all parties.”45 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts045]Although they passed a pleasant time, Germer disliked Billie: he found hercoarse and unworthy of the Beast. Despite this friction, Germer grudginglyagreed to pay the rent on their flat. They moved in September 15 and, at the endof the month, conducted a sex magick ritual to consecrate Billie as Crowley’snew Scarlet Woman.That October—despite Germany’s economic catastrophe and Germer’s own financialdistress—the art exhibit was on the verge of opening. Tension was high as Germerpaid for framing seventy-three paintings and drawings (ultimately fifty-one wereshown) and Crowley brought his copies of The Equinox, Konx Om Pax, The Legend ofAleister Crowley, Moonchild, The Diary of a Drug Fiend, and other books todisplay. The exhibit opened at the Gallery Neumann-Nierendorf on October 11 withmany newspapers, the New York Times included, photographing and interviewingCrowley about the show. In the exhibition’s catalog, Nierendorf—comparing him toDix, Nolde, Beckmann, Mueller, Schmidt-Rottluff, and Scholz—praised Crowley’sworks:there can be no doubt that the arranged exhibition is stimulating and moreimpressive than a lot of the English artwork we might otherwise have shown. Thepaintings are by the intensity of their desire and the primitiveness of theirexecution more closely related to German artists than to the rehash of customaryFrench recipes commonly knocked together on the other side of the Channeltoday.46 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts046]Crowley’s diary for the day notes “Show about normal.” Despite the warmresponse, whether anything sold is unknown.47[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts047] In the end, Crowley packed hispaintings and stored them with Martha Küntzel.One good thing resulted from the show, however. On its first day, Crowleyreceived a phone call from Gerald Hamilton (c. 1888–1970), who identifiedhimself as Berlin correspondent for the London Times. He wanted to interviewCrowley. Hamilton has been described as a strange wanderer: born in China, hewas a world traveler and a connoisseur of fine food, and described Crowley as a“bon bourgeois” sharing his fondness for good talk and good food. They had somuch in common that—despite Hamilton’s lack of interest in magick—they hit itoff well. By the time Germer discovered Hamilton was not really a presscorrespondent, it no longer mattered: the two men were close friends. Comparedto Germer’s antics, Hamilton was a godsend. Crowley filled his days“pentagramming off the Germers”48[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts048] until, that fall,“Karl … ditched Cora with his family and got a charming girl of thirty-one.”49[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts049]During the art exhibit, an associate of Martha Küntzel’s had a vision of theScarlet Woman pregnant. When, on October 22, Billie suffered again from whatCrowley dubbed the Nameless Fear—menstruation marked by heavy bleeding andpainful cramps—the prophecy seemed wrong. AC was nevertheless nervous. When thepain became worse on October 26, he called a physician, who diagnosed hercomplaint as a miscarriage. “I was utterly crushed by sorrow and anxiety allday,” Crowley recorded.50 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts050]Billie recovered by the end of the month, and that November their sex livesassumed wildly orgiastic dimensions, driven by an intense, violent passion thatbrought out the beast in both of them. Crowley’s diary entries make this clear:Monday, November 2. We went crazy. Instantly we got home I got down on S[carlet]W[oman]. She pissed gallons—we tore off our clothes & fucked & fucked & fucked.She tore my lips & my tongue—the blood streamed all over her face. We fucked.And suddenly she got a jealous fit about 3 cheap whores at Brunnigs & Istrangled her—Tuesday, November 3. Woke early & finished the fuck. Opus 59 very gently: bothexhausted.Tuesday November 10. S[carlet] W[oman] again rather upset at night—for no reasonunless too much Korn & cunnilingus before dinner.Wednesday November 11. A general orgie—including every possible device—from 3 to6.30.Thursday November 12. Recuperating—making vows of chastity—U.S.W. And while Iwas telephoning after lunch, she went into the study & waited for me with herbare bottom in the air … Opus 66.On December 6, Billie got drunk again on corn alcohol, and she and Crowley beganhumping on the sofa. When their landlady walked in, Billie sheepishly hid in thekitchen while Crowley retreated to his study. Billie surprised AC when shewalked into the study and drove a carving knife into him, just below theshoulder blade. “She then became violent,” he recalled.51[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts051] “I had to hold her down. So Ibled till Marie [the landlady] got a doctor, about 2 hrs. later.” Mostinteresting about this incident is Crowley’s reaction. When Hamilton heard aboutthe stabbing, he felt ill; and when Crowley wrote matter-of-factly that had thewound been a quarter inch lower it would have been fatal, Yorke was alarmed. YetCrowley responded, “I wish you would read my letters carefully. The wound wasnot dangerous though I lost quarts of blood, but it just missed being fatal,which is different.”52 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts052] Ratherthan making it a bone of contention, he took it in stride as a facet of theirrelationship. The day after the stabbing, he noted with relief in his diary,“Bill started to menstruate, thus explaining everything neatly.”53[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts053]Crowley shared Christmas dinner of 1931 with Karl, his mistress Hedy, andHamilton, along with novelist Christopher Isherwood (1904–1986) and poet StephenSpender (1909–1995). Throughout the meal, Billie threatened Crowley with thesilverware for misbehaving, and afterward slunk over and said,Nach dem Essen sollst Du rauchenoder deine Frau gebrauchen.54 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts054](“After dinner you should smoke, or use your wife.”) Crowley laughed and askedher to fetch his pipe.Hamilton and Isherwood were both homosexual and became close friends afterCrowley introduced them. That evening they took AC to the Cosy Corner, a smallblue-collar gay bar. Finding masculine and vain young men driven to prostitutionby the economic collapse of the Weimar republic, Crowley giggled, “I haven’tdone anything like this since I was in Port Said.” He bellied up to the bar andfixed his gaze on a bare-chested, sinewy man there. Beast, accustomed toBillie’s wild appetites, walked up and scratched him deeply on the chest. Theman prepared to pulverize Crowley, and only a large gift of money saved Crowleyfrom a pummeling. On the last day of 1931, AC again found himself in the companyof his gay friends at a ball of homosexuals. Crowley called it “Frightfullydull, pretentious, & grotesque. Left at 11:30.”55[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts055]Crowley’s friendship with Hamilton intensified when, on January 22, 1932, thestrange wanderer became a boarder in the spare room of Crowley’s flat. Thearrangement also gave Crowley another opportunity to earn money: sinceHamilton’s politics leaned leftward, and he had introduced Crowley to Germancommunist leaders such as Ernst Thaelmann (1886–1944), Beast worked as a Britishagent, submitting regular reports on Hamilton to Colonel Carter in ScotlandYard. In a letter to Yorke, Crowley cautioned,Hamilton leaves for London to-morrow night, and may probably call on you. If heshould learn that I am as I was born, my usefulness would be over; and if heshould even suspect that I have any relations with N[icholas Carter] beyondpulling his leg, there would be work for you within a week or two with thatembalmer. So please avoid discussing my politics, or, if forced to do so, saythat you regard me as at least 80 per cent Bolshevik. Do please take this mostseriously and be as cautious as you know how.56[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts056]Hamilton was good-humored about the arrangement; as Deacon suggests,57[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts057] he was probably spying onCrowley for the Germans.Living with Crowley, Hamilton witnessed the constant and frequently violentrelationship between Beast and Frau Busch. Early one afternoon, Hamilton camehome to find Billie trussed up like a chicken, with a note beside her warningthat under no circumstances should he untie her. On another occasion, Hamiltoncame home late one night to find broken crockery strewn all over and Billiesleeping, stark naked, in front of the long-extinguished hearth. Although theroom was freezing in the dead of winter, Hamilton left her undisturbed. He wentto Crowley’s room, where the master was sleeping fully clothed, shook him, andasked, “Is Billie sick?” Crowley sighed angrily. “Hasn’t that bitch gone to bedyet?” To Hamilton’s surprise, Crowley rolled out of bed, stomped into the livingroom, and gave Billie a stern kick. She leapt to her feet, and their obviousstruggle began anew. Hamilton watched, dumbfounded, as Crowley tried to hold herdown and reach for the rope simultaneously. “Don’t just stand there looking likea bloody gentleman,” Crowley cried. “Help me bind her!” Hamilton ignored boththeir pleas for assistance and left the flat, returning later with a doctor, whogave her morphine (the usual cure when she got this way). Crowley’s diary entryfor this evening is indeed cryptic: “Bill—whew! the best show yet. Started tofuck—she got sadistic—then savage—poor Hamilton!—(I had got her quiet when hecame in & woke her) doctor—morphia—hell till 6:30.”58[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts058]Finances picked up again that May 1, 1932, when Crowley heard the sad news thatRose had died in February; Lola Zaza was now receiving £232 annually from hermother’s estate, entitling Crowley to the full £165 annually from their jointtrust fund. However, this only guaranteed £3 a week for himself and Bill, andCrowley insisted he needed at least fifty a month to carry on his business.Before long, Crowley would petition Yorke thatthe trustees have it in their discretion to pay none, or any part, or the whole,of the income to any one of the beneficiaries. I made my application to you andFrater D.D.S. [George Cecil Jones] to let me have the whole amount while thingsremain in their exceedingly critical situation.… Lola is the only child of hermother who has quite an adequate income of at least £500 a year; and GeraldKelly is making very large sums out of his outrages upon the art which heprofesses and prostitutes.Yorke’s terse recollection of this matter: “We continued to pay Lola some or allor none in accordance with her needs.”59[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts059]At this time, Crowley’s literary career was looking up. A producer in Berlinnamed Ribbons wished to put on Mortadello if Crowley could get it translatedinto German; publisher Hans Weber hoped to issue translations of Crowley’sworks; and a filmmaker named Offuls wanted to make occult films based onCrowley’s work. AC was notorious for misspelling names, and “Offuls” is almostcertainly German—and later Hollywood—movie director Max Ophüls (1902–1957), whowas just beginning to gain international acclaim with his Liebelei (“LoveAffair,” 1932). To capitalize on these opportunities, AC planned a Germanpublication syndicate with Yorke and other backers. He hoped to publish full andcondensed versions of his Confessions, the plays Mortadello and Three Wishes,and several leftovers from the Mandrake plan, including a short storycollection, Liber Aleph, and Little Essays Toward Truth. He wrote eagerly, “Theplan is to put me over in Germany as they did for Bernard Shaw, Frank Harris andOscar Wilde. Then and only then will the English follow.”60[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts060]Once again he counted on Yorke to produce the capital necessary to pull off thedeal; but, stung by Mandrake’s collapse, Yorke was reluctant to place himself—orany of his acquaintances—at Crowley’s mercy. Although he contacted potentialfinanciers, none wished to invest in the Great Beast. When a much-anticipatedloan to Yorke fell through, Crowley was so disappointed and furious that heaccused Yorke of sabotaging the deal. He fired off several acrid letters toYorke, including the following:Every word you write is in an attempt to avoid your own responsibility. The £30,not yet here, means a reprieve until the end of the month, no more, and does notin the least remove the feeling that we are standing on the drop. You aretreating us as Boston treated Sacco & Vanzetti,61[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts061] and you apparently expectcompliments and gratitude.Now here is another ethical point, and one so deadly serious that I must copyyour words and rub it in: “If we start talking of the cat, I would suggest youqualify for its reception by involving a sick woman in your affairs when you arenot in a position to look after her properly.” You really wrote that base andvile sentence. It is before my eyes or I should find it hard to believe that anyman, however low, could ever admit. But I’m afraid that’s you all over. “What?He’s sick? He’s poor? He’s likely to die? His work is in danger? Hurrah. Thatlets me out.”Your one thought is to abandon the ship. “Alright, I’ll take the MSS and you candie in the gutter.” … Never mind. Go on with your little dinners and dances withpeople who don’t count and who are doomed anyway to perish in their ownstupidity.”62 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts062]That was just the beginning. Although Frater Volo Intellegere passed fromProbationer to Neophyte in November 1931, he failed, in AC’s estimation, toaccept the work of the order. Crowley expected him to sacrifice everything—hisfamily, fortune, and reputation—for the Great Work: namely helping the chosenProphet of Thelema do his job. His reluctance to do so, in Crowley’s mind, wascowardly, the sort of materialistic clinging that doomed the Babe of the Abyss.In an effort to return Yorke to his senses, Crowley wrote a series of insultingletters questioning Yorke’s motives, loyalty, and manhood.Yorke, however, was not about to throw away his life the way that Leah, Norman,Ninette, and others before him had. Perhaps he was materialistic, but he had alot to lose; at this point he was contemplating marriage and an extended trip toShanghai. While he admired Crowley as a great writer and teacher, Yorke had nointention of ruining himself to put over the Great Work.Yorke recalled the episode ending unresolved when “I told him to come to Londonand raise the money himself.”63[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts063] On May 29, Crowley insteadsent Billie to London to negotiate loans with Yorke. She arrived in old clothesand stayed in a cheap Fitzrovia hotel, with Yorke feeding and supporting her.“Without your presence, it is hopeless for her to raise money,” Yorke said,trying to convince him to come to London himself. “Do try and get it into yourhead that, however willing, I have not got the cash to support Bill.”64[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts064] Crowley maintained he couldnot make the trip without £200 to buy new clothes.Frustrated by Crowley’s refusal to tend to his own business, Bill spent much ofher time in suicidal tears. Yorke was aghast, thinking he was seeing Crowleydestroy Bill the way he did Marie. To complicate things, Crowley had written a£10 check without funds to cover it: an offense punishable by imprisonment. “Icannot see how sitting tight will help you,” he wrote again. “You will merelymope, play chess, drink, and develop toothache, asthma and other nervouscomplaints.”65 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts065] However,Crowley soon found himself evicted from his flat on June 17 for nonpayment, andhe set off five days later for London. It was the last time Crowley would resideoutside England.Crowley traveled north of London to the Colney Hatch asylum on July 5. Checkingon Marie, he spoke with her doctor, Alexander Cannon (1896–1963), a figure asodd as Crowley.Square and stout with a very large head, entirely bald except for patches ofgreying hair above the ears, he reminds you a little of an outsize Pickwick. Hisround clean-shaven face is pink but a trifle blotchy; his mouth pursed.… Blackcoat, striped trousers, spats, and the scarlet ribbon of one of the foreignorders of which his is a member—he prefers to be known as “His Excellency DoctorSir Alexander Cannon”—complete one of the most striking ensembles in Medicine.66[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts066]He earned both an MD and PhD from his schooling in Leeds, London, Vienna, andHong Kong, and wrote several texts for his profession. He also traveled in theOrient, studying under yogis and learning secrets of mediumship, teleportation,and magic. His book The Invisible Influence (1933) would contain an account ofhim levitating himself, his porters, and his luggage across a chasm in Tibet.67[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts067] Crowley noted he had “rather abug in his brain over hypnosis,” which he felt could be used to tap mankind’shidden powers.Cannon would go on to publish his eccentric theories in The Invisible Influence,with the result that, in December 1933, he would be asked to resign from ColneyHatch. Although he would find another post at Bexley Heath Mental Hospital, hewould devote much energy to teatime lectures and demonstrations of magic at theMayfair Hotel.For now, he said Mrs. Crowley’s case was hopeless, and he requested AC “to leaveMarie severely alone.”68 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts068]Despite differences of opinion between the man who claimed to have levitatedhimself across a fifty-foot river and the man who claimed to be the WorldTeacher as prophesied in the Book of Revelation, Crowley respected Cannon’srequest to leave Marie alone. Colney Hatch was her home for the next twentyyears, where she died during the 1950s.A series of disappointments marked the second half of the summer of 1932.Yorke’s plans to travel to Shanghai left Crowley financially high and dry. WhenAC’s landlord evicted him, seizing his possessions in lieu of unpaid rent, Yorkepaid £50 for the manuscripts and added them to his growing collection. Crowley’splan to put on a performance of Mortadello fell through when his collaborator,Ribbons, backed out. The metaphorical backbreaker came on September 7 whenCrowley read Nina Hamnett’s autobiography, Laughing Torso (1932). It had comeout while he was in Berlin, and this was his first chance to peruse it. Ninamentioned AC throughout, painting him in a kind light, and imagined her formerguru would be delighted. However, Crowley reacted with acrimony when he read thefollowing passage:Crowley had a temple in Cefalù in Sicily. He was supposed to practise BlackMagic there, and one day a baby was said to have disappeared mysteriously. Therewas also a goat there. This all pointed to Black Magic, so people said, and theinhabitants of the village were frightened of him.69[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts069]“Abominable libels,” he wrote in his diary,70[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts070] and took the book to hissolicitor. He demanded an injunction and planned to sue. While he was at it, healso sued Ribbons and Yorke for good measure.On September 7, Crowley filed for £40,000 in damages against Yorke, the sum hewould have made if Yorke hadn’t mismanaged his finances. Stunned, Yorke figuredthis could only be a ploy to keep him from leaving for Shanghai. It clarified toYorke that Crowley would stop at nothing to extract contributions from hisstudents. Thus Yorke resigned from theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg].He gave Kerman the diaries of two probationers he had been supervising—Mrs.French (Soror Maximus) and Mr. Vilette (Volo Vincere)—along with the remainingstock of Crowley’s books. He provided his own solicitors with a written accountof his dealings with Crowley, then left for China in the middle of September.The case never came to court.Despite the harsh words between them, Yorke and Crowley corresponded and visitedafter his return from Shanghai. Because Yorke was no longer a student, Crowleymade no further financial demands of him. Because he was free to support Crowleywhen and how he saw fit, Yorke continued to help both morally and financially.He saw something remarkably brilliant in Crowley and, despite their differingideologies, vowed to preserve Crowley’s legacy. Nevertheless, their past was aninvisible wall between them. It would be eleven years before they made peace. OnJune 6, 1944, Crowley would write to Yorke:1. It is dangerous to judge a man unless you have been able to put yourself inhis place. I want you to understand me first of all; to look through my eyes atwhat happened between us.2. I have always taken myself and my mission with absolute seriousness. Ibelieved in the chiefs and in my authority; also that those who opposed me wereasking for trouble. I was, if you like, 80% crazy in the same sense thatMohammed was, and I have often regretted that my common sense and my sense ofhumour prevented me from going over the line. But I was never 1/10th of 1%dishonest. Use your imagination. Suppose I had been a Spencer Lewis. What agarden path I could have led you down, and nothing would ever have persuaded youthat it wasn’t the path of the wise.3. When we first met, I was having my Indian Summer. No. 1 with Kasimira andHanni.… Plus I interpreted your motto as ‘I will to become a Master of theTemple’ in just that sense of the words that was true to me. I see now that youhad not really bound yourself by this oath, but I thought you had done so. Thecrux of this initiation, as you know, is to surrender—or, rather, toannihilate—“all that I have and all that I am.” When, therefore, it seemed to methat you were not taking your fences cleanly, I concluded that you were becomingdivided against yourself—whence, of course, Black Brothers and all the rest ofit—and jumped. What you read as abuse I had written as the Archbishop’s mostfatherly of rebukes.…4. About money … Do please try once more to put it on my boots. Remember that Ihad spent over £100,000 of my own money, directly or indirectly, on the GreatWork. This purchase of the egg without haggling was completely in my blood, sothat I simply could not understand how any serious aspirant could even think ofdoing otherwise … I am still utterly sure that this is a condition Number 1 offull attainment, but I realize that there are people who don’t see, and can’t bemade to see, the necessity.71 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts071]On August 17, 1932, in the midst of frustrations and litigations, AC met withLondon’s largest and most famous bookseller, William Alfred Foyle (1885–1963),and his daughter, Christina (1911–1999). Crowley’s was a familiar face to theFoyles, and they arranged to buy half the four hundred remaining copies ofMagick in Theory and Practice that Hanchant had remaindered, trimmed in size,and bound in a red hardcover sans the color plate. Foyle paid five shillingsapiece for the books, and scheduled AC to speak at its September 15 literaryluncheon.Miss Foyle began organizing her literary luncheons in 1930 when she was justnineteen. She hosted not only prominent writers like Shaw and Wells but alsopainters, actors, prime ministers, and other celebrities. They proved wildlysuccessful, not only providing great publicity but also keeping the businessafloat during the lean 1930s.72[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts072] Although people told her thatshe should be ashamed of herself for hosting a man of Crowley’s reputation, sheknew him as a frequent patron of her father’s bookstore. Having spent manyenjoyable hours visiting him in his Earls Court flat, she knew him to beharmless. Her attitude was more in line with Rose Macaulay, who said of theluncheon, “I don’t mind what he does, as long as he doesn’t turn himself into agoat.”Five hundred guests, including London’s social and literary elite, attendedFoyle’s Twenty-third Literary Luncheon at Grosvenor House. Crowley’s talk on“The Philosophy of Magick” was one of his most lucid.I am sorry if I am not as frivolous as might be required by the exigencies ofthe occasion, but Magick is a very serious subject, and I have a very seriousmessage to bring to you. It is very little understood what Magick is. It isconnected in the minds of some people with conjuring. In the minds of others itis connected with charlatanism. I want to tell you that Magick has been sincethe very earliest ages of humanity the tradition of the wise men. I want to tellyou what the essential doctrine of the magician is with regard to man’s place inthe universe and that it is given in The Book of the Law that “every man andevery woman is a star.” What is a star? Philosophers have always agreed aboutone thing—that is that the Universe to be intelligible at all must be consideredas one and homogeneous. Therefore you can understand the position of the mysticwho says that each of us is a member of the body of God. You can understand whatis written in the Bible, “Your bodies are the temples of the Holy Ghost.” It isupon these postulates that the general theory of Magick is founded.73[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts073]After the luncheon, women with autograph books lined up for an introduction tothe Wickedest Man in the World. He was elated with the outcome, writing in hisdiary, “Made a good speech!!!!!!”74[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts074] With the book released to thepublic, rather than subscribers, for the first time, the Occult Review finallyreviewed it. Neuburg also gave it a positive treatment in The Referee; in fact,he was so impressed that he briefly contacted Crowley again.After he became the Referee’s poetry editor in April 1933 Neuburg discoveredDylan Thomas and eventually passed on his tales of AC. Shortly thereafter,Thomas formed a second connection to Crowley when he took Betty May as a lover;her involvement in AC’s lawsuit against Nina Hamnett would soon follow.Unsurprisingly, several apocryphal tales have circulated wherein Dylan Thomasmeets the Beast. As one legendary account goes, some time later, in 1941 or1942, Thomas would find himself in pubs, retelling the stories he had heard fromNeuburg, such as the time Crowley turned him into a camel in the Sahara Desert.One evening, Thomas and his companion, Theodora, were waiting to meet someonewhen the patrons began discussing ghosts. “Dullan,” one finally called out,“tell us: have ye ever seen a ghost?”Thomas, who was normally very uneasy about paranormal events, replied jovially,“No, but Aleister Crowley appeared in my bathwater once.”The room fell silent. Only then did he realize that the Wickedest Man in theWorld himself was sitting at the end of the bar. Thomas dropped his head andabsorbed himself in doodling, as he often did when moody or uncomfortable.Eventually, Crowley walked up and presented Thomas with a scrap of paper. Uponit was a duplicate of his doodle. In response, Dylan grabbed Theodora’s handand, even though they hadn’t met their friend, whisked her out of the pub.Certainly more fiction than fact, it remains a popular “Crowley story.”On September 20, 1932, Isidore Kerman served a writ on Hamnett’s publisher,Constable and Co., to immediately cease production of Laughing Torso until thecourts heard Crowley’s libel complaint. Two days later in Vacation Court,Chancery, AC argued that Hamnett’s collection of anecdotes about him wereindecent, vulgar, and ignorant. They were entirely untrue, and he couldn’tunderstand how the book came to be written. Justice Lawrence ruled that theinjunction against Constable and Co. should stand until the October 5 hearing.Crowley claimed he, Kerman, Hamnett, and her publisher met thereafter and agreedto an out-of-court settlement of £1,000 and a published apology, but that “Ninagot a crook lawyer to start a fuss.”75[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts075] Lawyer Martin O’Connorconvinced Nina to defend herself. On October 5, the injunction Crowley v.Constable and Co., Limited and Others came to court. After four hours’ testimonyand fifteen minutes’ consideration, the injunction was defeated pending theoutcome of the libel suit. “Considering that he had by law to decide againstus,” Crowley commented, “he made it damned hot for O’Connor.”76[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts076] Even though the injunction wassettled, the libel case itself had only begun.AC moved into 20 Leicester Square on September 26 and began preparing a talk onpsychic rejuvenation. Harry Price (1881–1948) of the National Laboratory ofPsychical Research for the Scientific Investigation of Alleged AbnormalPhenomena had invited Crowley to give the lecture before the Society forPsychical Research on October 5. Admission was ten guineas a head, and thelecture, titled “Amrita,” was Crowley’s ploy to advertise OTO’s secret “tonic ofrejuvenation.” The basis of his claims rested in the youthful bursts of energyCrowley experienced during his retirement at Lake Pasquaney in 1916, when he wasexperimenting heavily with sex magick. While sworn not to reveal the sexualcomponents of this elixir, he accepted a few “patients” to receive the miracledrug at the rate of twenty-five guineas weekly.As Frau Busch increasingly frequented London’s pubs—including one named Cheerio,where a drugged prostitute reputedly bit her—her relationship with Crowleybecame less intimate. She faded from the picture at this time. Shortly after NewYear’s Day 1933, she entered Grosvenor Hospital for Women; shortly thereafter,Crowley noted in his diary that he was “Arranging Bill’s marriage.”77[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts077] She finally ran off with aformer middle-weight boxing champion, who supposedly beat her and forced her towalk the streets; because “it does not improve a woman’s allure … if her face isa purplish pulp,”78 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts078] she faredpoorly, for which her husband would beat her and send her back out again. Theseclaims about fallen friends were typical of Crowley, going back to the firsttime he claimed an impecunious Mathers was pimping his wife.On Saturday, January 7, 1933—after seeing Billie off to Brighton—Crowley walkedthe Paddington streets. Passing the Modern Book Co. at 23 Praed Street, he spieda copy of Moonchild in the window, along with a card reading “Aleister Crowley’sfirst novel, The Diary of a Drug Fiend, was withdrawn from circulation after anattack in the sensational press.” He was furious at the implication that hisfirst novel had been suppressed. Despite his efforts with the “Open Letter toLord Beaverbrook” and The Legend of Aleister Crowley, the public stillconsidered him a degenerate. “Libel!” he muttered to himself.That Tuesday, Crowley visited his solicitor and began a suit charging thebookseller, Mr. Gray, with libel. The case came to court on May 10, when JusticeBennett ruled in favor of Crowley, who received £50 and costs:There was not the smallest ground for suggesting that any book Mr. Crowley hadwritten was indecent or improper. Mr. Gray wanted the public to believe that thebook to which the label was attached was an indecent book.79[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts079]In order to produce documentation for his elixir of rejuvenation, Crowley beganrecording his physical state when taking this elixir. On January 23, 1933, hebegan the experiment, noting the condition of his asthma, weight, stricture, sexdrive, and other matters. After the first week, Crowley noted marginalimprovement in his asthma and his stricture “quite miraculously less,” althoughhe still suffered from broken sleep and a distended abdomen. On February 8, hehad sex for the first time in months, noting “These were difficult to performand quite unsatisfactory in result.”80[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts080]When he completed the experiment after five weeks, he decided that his activesex life and absence of stricture indicated success. “Thoughts all robust &juvenile e.g. I think naturally of ski if it snows; I want to walk rather thanride etc., etc. Irritated (7 a.m.) because I can’t go & take exercise!”81[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts081] Although Crowley judged hisexperiment a success, his diaries suggest otherwise: he was still unable tosleep, his asthma constantly left him coughing badly, and he spent February 19sick in bed all day.Another scheme at this time was to market Crowley’s distinctive sex attractionointment. Called “IT,” the perfume gave AC an unusual—but not unpleasant—scent.As with Amrita, the active ingredient of IT was Crowley’s sexual fluids. On June9, Crowley recorded in his diary, “IT worked wonders—all women after me!” Likethe previous scheme, IT never took off.That June, Crowley sold a series of articles to the Sunday Dispatch for £40. Inthem, he defended himself against accusations made about him in the press, andsought to educate readers on matters of the occult:I have been accused of being a ‘black magician.’ No more foolish statement wasever made about me. I despise the thing to such an extent that I can hardlybelieve in the existence of people so debased and idiotic as to practice it.…The “Black Mass” is a totally different matter. I could not celebrate it if Iwanted to, for I am not a consecrated priest of the Christian Church.82[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts082]These articles were evidently ghost-written by Dispatch feature writer IanCoster (b. 1903), who translated AC’s florid words into journalistic prose.Hoping to attract readers with a series of articles “by” the wickedest man inthe world, Coster was disappointed to find Crowley less wicked than expected,complaining, “He makes black magic as tame as a kids’ party” and “The only blackthings I discovered about him were his pipe and tobacco.”83[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts083]The Sunday Dispatch pieces were among several articles that ran in London papersin 1933, including the Referee and Empire News, to rehabilitate hisreputation.84 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts084] Although Crowleycould not undo the damage done by the Sunday Express and John Bull, he hoped toregain some credibility.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_079_r1.jpg]Crowley around the time of his 1933 lawsuit with Ethel Mannin. (photo credit18.2) [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c18-fig002a]At this time, Crowley read novelist and travel writer Ethel Mannin’s (1900–1984)memoirs, Confessions and Impressions (1930), where she described Crowley as“that high priest of black magic who likes nothing better than to be regarded asHis Satanic Majesty the Prince of Darkness, and who would take it as acompliment to be called an arch-devil.”85[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts085] This and similar passages sentCrowley into Kerman’s office, filing an injunction against the publisher andprinter. When the case appeared before Justice Farwell on July 25, 1933,Mannin’s solicitor, John W. Morris, argued that the book came out in 1930, andCrowley had voiced no objection to its contents. Constantine Gallop argued onCrowley’s behalf that he knew nothing at all about the book when it appeared,and that the passages about him were entirely untrue. Alas, Justice Farwelldeclined to grant the injunction.Meanwhile, AC’s students thrived in the United States. As early as May 1929,Jane Wolfe had begun preparing for an OTO lodge in Hollywood. Her circleincluded her voice teacher Regina Kahl, Max and Leota Schneider, and WilfredTalbot Smith (1885–1957), with whom Wolfe had had a brief affair. Smith was apale and short man who had signed Jones’s 1914 petition for a Vancouver OTOcharter from Reuss. In 1921 Crowley appointed him Grand Treasurer General ofBritish Columbia, honorary VII°, and Sovereign Grand Inspector General. When in1932 Crowley appointed Smith as his successor, he and Kahl (now his lover) tooka large house at 1746 Winona Boulevard in Los Angeles as their headquarters.Loving simple things in life—nature, literature, conversation, andhandiwork—Smith eagerly converted the attic into a temple.86[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts086]Crowley encouraged their public performances of the Gnostic Mass every Sunday,with the ambitious hope that the California group could find a priestess withlots of sex appeal and film the mass with Crowley as priest. The masses inSmith’s attic temple attracted a dozen or so observers, largely from a curiousgroup of science fiction writers. When the group began to recycle its profitsinto improving the temple, the perpetually penniless Crowley objected to havinghis contributions cut. Smith, meanwhile, insisted they needed a properlyequipped temple to attract people and money with a spectacular Gnostic Mass.Ultimately, their correspondence became petty, Crowley ridiculing Smith’sgrammar and accusing him of mismanaging the Great Work. Smith, who worked for apittance as a bookkeeper for the California Gas Company since 1922, objected tothe accusations:Christ, you are like a child.… Listen, I may write rotten letters as far asspelling and literary style, but I don’t misrepresent or exaggerate. I neversaid or intimated that 80 or 100 people attended the Mass. I merely said we hadtwo social affairs which that number attended.My attic temple is 36 by 16 feet, and at the most, if the floor would stand it,could not contain more than 30 people. I don’t sit on my arse all day, but leavethe house at 8 in the morning and return at 5:30 pm if I don’t stay at theoffice until 10:00 pm as I did twice last week. In my spare time, when not tooworn out, I endeavor to make social contacts in the hope that they may be of useto Us.…Three times I have built a temple on this continent. There is nothing to it, Iknow, for any dumb carpenter could have done the same if we had had the money topay him. The point is we did not have it.…You have not made much money out of your talent with a pen and paper. I have notmade money out of my talent with a hammer and nails. Perhaps together we may yetbecome bloated capitalists for the world’s good.87[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts087]Regina Agnes Kahl (1891–1945) came to Smith’s defense. Kahl was a mezzosopranoopera singer and music teacher who gave concerts in Los Angeles in the early1930s. In subsequent years, she would be civically active as a member of the LosFeliz Women’s Club and the Hollywood branch of the National League of AmericanPen Women (serving as its corresponding secretary before becoming itspresident), and even direct the Los Angeless Evening College Players’ productionof the Gertrude Tonkonog Broadway comedy Three Cornered Moon.88[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts088] As Smith’s lover, she wasdefensive; and as someone described as as “60% male,”89[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts089] she responded aggressively toCrowley:Dear 666,I don’t know how you judge devotion to a cause, but by your letter to [Jacobi],I take it it’s by a dollar and cent basis. If there’s one thing I hate aboutthis age of commercialism and ballyhoo, it is that gilt complex and I don’t givea damn who manifests it, it’s still the shits! If there is no other thing bredin the brethren of the house of Thelema in Los Angeles there is loyalty to ourhead here and devotion to the Master Therion—but when he gets the big idea thatwe are all sitting on our arses doing nothing he is mistaken and in my very bestAmerican slang “And how!”You can jolly well bet we are not doing a Christly lot of ballyhooing. We areleaving that to Amy [sic] McPherson90[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts090] and her kind. Being born inthis country of hot air and big noise, bluff and bullshit, I prefer to have nopart in that sort of propaganda.Personally for Leota, Jake and Wilfred especially, and the others as well asthey can, all are doing what can be done to put what we all consider thegreatest work of the age by the greatest genius to a mass of people who aresuffering for the need of a new ethics, true morality, sane values and spiritualoutlook. This is not to be done overnight by a publicity campaign a la BobScheuller method. The whole country is fed up to the gills with this crap now.We can only hope to succeed by loyalty and tenacity.…Now kick me out of the Order if you like, but you will still find me hanging onthe tail of theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]kite.91 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts091]Crowley responded evasively to this onslaught, dismissing most of what was flungat him. To Smith he wrote, “The letter from Regina is misspelt and overloadedwith filthy words. I cannot take any notice of such things.”92[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts092]IT wafted from Crowley on July 3 when he met Evelyn Pearl Brooksmith, née Driver(1899–1967). A thirty-four-year-old widow, Pearl, as she was known, lived at 40Cumberland Terrace with her son, John. She shared AC’s appreciation for strongdrink. She didn’t know him as Aleister Crowley until their second meeting onAugust 9. “She was staggered when I told her my name,” he wrote in his diary.Within a week they began practicing sex magick; he moved in with her mere dayslater, and they soon became engaged. On September 1, Crowley consecrated her ashis Scarlet Woman. “I feel the flame of fornication creeping up my body,” shetold him, and he took it as a perfect magical phrase; however, the events tofollow overshadowed this.On the autumnal equinox, after a ritual to obtain the word of the equinox, Pearlhad a vision of an Adept in the Himalayas. Several days later, Crowley recordedin his diary:Wednesday, September 27. Opus 24. Invoking the Essence of Godhead within theScarlet Woman. She became One with the Infinite White Light. Then, minorvisions.Opus 25 natural. S.W.’s Vision of Pan [Pan].Thursday, September 28. Vision of Rosy Light in room. (Only other case I had wasin Nefta).Brooksmith had a gift for visions, and she and the Beast enjoyed a terrificpsychic rapport. On one occasion, Crowley had a clairvoyant vision of hercottage and various people she knew; two days later, Pearl heard a voice tellher she was Kali. “The Goddess of lust and murder,” Crowley replied. “Yes,yes!”93 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts093] Despite her talents,AC commented little on her visions and even tired of them. After thirty years ofclairvoyant alcoholics, he had become jaded.On October 25, as Pearl’s menstruation completed its cycle, Crowley insistedthey curtail their constant sex “unless she was prepared to play up to herbody.” Although he desired no unwanted pregnancies, Pearl was unconcerned. “Allgreat Saviours have been bastards,” she replied, and their intimacy continuedunabated. In fact, they actively sought to have a child. On November 2, duringone sex magical act, Pearl had a vision of icy peaks jutting out of a sandyplain where a dark-haired, white-skinned woman offered Pearl a baby boy on awhite dish. A good omen, they concluded. On November 18, however, Crowley notedwith disappointment that Pearl began her period on schedule. “Alas! Yet it isbetter for all three to wait a little while.”When Pearl’s visions became more intense that December, Crowley distancedhimself:Tuesday, December 5. Opus 68 … S.W. goes on prolonged wild visions, veryuncontrolled, & is near the borderline. I don’t like it too well.He was too preoccupied to pay attention to hallucinations. His libel case overLaughing Torso was coming up, and frankly he was worried. His sex magick ritualswith Pearl were frequently for victory in his forthcoming legal battle, and hespent the autumn of 1933 repeatedly consulting the I Ching about the outcome ofthe trial. Seeking three character witnesses, he contacted his most respectableacquaintances: J. W. N. Sullivan, J. F. C. Fuller and J. D. Beresford. All threedeclined. Beresford, in fact, urged Crowley to drop the case. “I haven’t theleast doubt that some very extraordinary and damaging charges will be madeagainst you if you come into court.”94[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c18-nts094]Kerman agreed with Beresford. When he saw a copy of White Stains, he said thecase was as good as lost if the defense had it, as such a book had nojustification. Crowley, knowing most copies of the book had been destroyed,wasn’t worried. Thus Kerman, with Germer as Crowley’s only character witness,worked diligently to prepare the libel case against Constable and Co.Then, on December 18, Crowley heard from a man named Eddie Cruze, who offered toproduce damning evidence for the trial."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINETEENTHE BLACK MAGIC LIBEL CASEOn April 10, 1934—the thirtieth anniversary of writing chapter three of The Bookof the Law—Justice Swift and a special jury heard the case of Crowley v.Constable and Co., Limited and Others, informally known as the “Black MagicLibel Case.”1 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c19-nts001] J. P. Eddy andConstantine Gallop represented Aleister Crowley; Malcolm Hilbery represented thepublishers, Constable and Co.; and Martin O’Connor, one of the bar’s most famouspersonalities, represented author Nina Hamnett. For what promised to be the mostsensational trial in recent memory, droves of reporters and curiosity seekersturned out, ranging from a nineteen-year-old girl named Deirdre MacAlpine toeditor and author Anthony Powell, who worried that if Crowley won he would nextsue Duckworth over Tiger Woman.This trial did not disappoint, with newspapers devoting pages to its coverageover the ensuing four days. While the full transcript cannot be reproduced here,some gems of testimony passed Crowley’s lips in response to questions from boththe prosecution and the defense; selected highlights are reproduced.John Percy Eddy (1881–1975) was a former Daily Chronicle reporter who was calledto the bar in 1911. Serving as Judge of the High Court of Judicature in Madrasin 1929, he returned to the bar in England the following year. He published TheLaw of Distress the same year as this trial. Although not a brilliant orator, hewas known for his calm manner, his deliberate walk, and his plodding andpersistent advocacy.2 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c19-nts002] Hisopening statement summarized Crowley’s complaint: “The Laughing Torso purportsto be an account of the author’s own life, with intimate studies of her friendsand acquaintances. Mr. Crowley complains that in the book he is charged withhaving practiced that loathsome thing known as Black Magic. There is WhiteMagic, which is on the side of the angels, and rests on faith in the order anduniformity of Nature. Black Magic is a degrading thing, associated with thedegradation of religion, the invocation of devils, evil in its blackest forms,and even the sacrifices of children.” Crowley, Eddy explained, had fought blackmagic for years, stressing the importance of the Will. He was so serious, infact, that he started a community in an old farmhouse at Cefalù, Sicily, in 1920to study this principle. Hamnett’s depiction of the Abbey, however, wasdamaging. Eddy insisted, “No child disappeared mysteriously, and the only goaton the premises was kept for its milk.”“Are you familiar with the words ‘Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of theLaw’?” Eddy asked at one point.A smile crossed Crowley’s face in spite of himself. “I am.”“Did they have any reference to this house?”“They are the general principles on which I maintain all mankind should base itsconduct.”“What do they mean?”“The study of those words has occupied the last thirty years of my life,”Crowley explained proudly. “There is no end to what they mean, but the simplestapplication to practical conduct is this: That no man has a right to waste histime on doing things which are mere wishes or desires, but that he should devotehimself wholly to his true work in this world.”“Have those words anything to do with black magic?”“Only indirectly. They would forbid it, because black magic is suicidal.” Askedabout the difference between black and white magic, Crowley continued, “Inboxing you can fight according to the Queensberry rules or you can do the otherthing.”Malcolm Hilbery, for the defense, interjected, “Does that mean that hisdefinition of Black Magic is the same as all-in wrestling?” Laughter filled thecourtroom.“I approve some forms of magic and disapprove others,” AC elaborated.Eddy continued with his questions. “What is the form you disbelieve?”“That which is commonly known as black magic, which is not only foul andabominable, but, for the most part, criminal. To begin with, the basis of allblack magic is that utter stupidity of selfishness which cares nothing for therights of others. People so constituted are naturally quite unscrupulous. Inmany cases, black magic is an attempt to commit crime without incurring thepenalties of the law. The almost main instrument of black magic is murder,either for inheritance or for some other purpose, or in some way to gainpersonally out of it.”Malcolm Hilbery, hands in his pockets, questioned Crowley about hisidentification with To Mega Therion, the beast in the Book of Revelation. “Didyou take to yourself the designation of ‘The Beast 666’?”“Yes.”“Do you call yourself the ‘Master Therion’?”“Yes.”He nodded. “What does ‘Therion’ mean?”“Great wild beast.”“Do these titles convey a fair impression of your practice and outlook on life?”“It depends on what they mean.”“The Great Wild Beat and Beast 666 are out of the Apocalypse?”“It only means sunlight; 666 is the number of the sun,” he dismissed, thencracked a smile. “You can call me ‘Little Sunshine.’ ”At one point, Hilbery produced a book, to Crowley’s great surprise. He only knewof one or two other surviving copies. “Is White Stains a book of indescribablefilth?”Crowley remembered his lawyer’s warning that, if the defense had that book, hewould lose the case. In fact, Crowley identified himself as its author in hisConfessions, thus tipping off the defense.3[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c19-nts003] Early on in preparing theircase, Constable & Co.’s lawyers had tracked down a copy of White Stains,apparently borrowed from Scottish novelist Compton Mackenzie (1883–1972).4[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c19-nts004] When they finally read thebook, they declared, “I regard White Stains as an important find, especially asit is admitted by Crowley to have been written by him.”5[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c19-nts005]Crowley quickly tried to explain. “The book is a serious study of the progressof a man to the abyss of madness, disease and murder. There are moments when hedoes go down into all those abominations, and it is a warning to people againstgoing over.”“Have you made sonnets about unspeakable things?”“Yes. I have described in sonnet form certain pathological aberrations.”“White Stains is described as ‘Being the Literary Remains of George ArchibaldBishop, a Neuropath of the Second Empire.’ ”“Yes,” he agreed. “I think only one hundred copies were printed and handed tosome expert on the subject in Vienna.”“Was that done because you feared there might be a prosecution if they werepublished in this country?”“It was not,” he denied flatly. “It was a refutation of the doctrine that sexualperverts had no sense of moral responsibility and should not be punished. Imaintained that they had, and showed the way they got from bad to worse.”Crowley had argued the same point twenty years earlier when explaining to JohnQuinn that White Stains was written as a response to Krafft-Ebing.“You know it is an obscene book.”“I don’t know it. Until it got into your hands, it never got into any improperhands at all.”On April 11, the second day of the trial, Crowley’s cross-examination continued.Hilbery quoted Crowley’s articles in the Sunday Dispatch. “ ‘I have been shot atwith broad arrows. They have called me the worst man in the world. They haveaccused me of doing everything from murdering women and throwing their bodiesinto the Seine to drug peddling.’ Is that true?”“I hear a new canard about me every week. Any man of any distinction has rumorsabout him.”“Does any man of any distinction necessarily have it said about him that he isthe worst man in the world?”“Not necessarily: he has to be very distinguished for that.” Observers chuckled,and Crowley smiled.Hilbery asked pointedly, “Do you believe in the practice of bloody sacrifice?”“I believe in its efficacy.”“If you believe in its efficacy, you would believe in its being practiced?”Crowley scowled. “I do not approve of it at all.”“Do not approve it?” Referring to page 96 of Crowley’s Magick in Theory andPractice, he read:Those magicians who object to the use of blood have endeavoured to replace itwith incense. For such a purpose the incense of Abramelin may be burnt in largequantities. Dittany of Crete is also a valuable medium.… But the bloodysacrifice, though more dangerous, is most efficacious; and for nearly allpurposes human sacrifice is the best.From page 95 of the same book, Hilbery read:For the highest spiritual working one must accordingly choose that victim whichcontains the greatest and purest force. A male child of perfect innocence andhigh intelligence is the most satisfactory and suitable victim.A footnote that accompanied this text read, “It appears from the Magical Recordsof Frater Perdurabo that he made this particular sacrifice on an average about150 times every year between 1912 and 1928.”Crowley argued that the passages were statements about ancient practices, andnot meant seriously. What he did not explain was that his words were entirelyallegorical. “Sacrifice” meant to “make sacred,” and, to him, symbolized themost sacred act of all: sex. He referred not to the sacrifice of a life, but tomaking the sacred “elixir,” or combined sexual fluids of man and woman.Hilbery went on. “In March, 1923, did a Sunday newspaper publish about you anarticle headed, ‘Black Record of Aleister Crowley. Preying on the Debased.Profligacy and Vice in Sicily.’ ”Crowley agreed.“Have you taken any action about that?”“I have not.” When that article appeared, Crowley explained, he did not haveenough money to begin proceedings; he considered it a compliment to be“blackguarded in such an obviously filthy way.”Swift interposed at this point. “When you read, ‘it is hard to say withcertainty whether Crowley is man or beast,’ did you take any action?”“It was asked of Shelley whether he was a man or someone sent from Hell,” heanswered vaguely.“I am not trying Shelley. Did you take any steps to clear your character?”“I was 1,500 miles away,” Crowley replied. “I was ill. I was penniless.”Swift’s patience wore thin. “I didn’t ask about the state of your health. Didyou take any steps to clear your character?”“Yes.” Crowley said his solicitor advised that the action would last fourteendays and cost £10,000; thus, he could do nothing.“Now you see how absurd that advice was, because this case won’t take anythinglike fourteen days. It has now taken two whole days, and it will probably takethe whole of tomorrow. It may go into Friday, though I am not sure about that.It won’t last more than four days. I imagine you have not found £10,000, haveyou?”“You said yesterday that as a result of early experiments you invoked certainforces with the result that some people were attacked by unseen assailants,”Martin O’Connor asked Crowley on the morning of Thursday, April 12, when thethird day of the black magic libel case opened. “That is right, is it not?”“Yes.”“Will you try your magic now on my learned friend?” He pointed to Hilbery.Tempting though the prospect must have seemed, Crowley replied promptly, “Iwould not attack anybody.”“Is that because you are too considerate or because you are an impostor?” Hechuckled at his debunking of the magician.“I have never done willful harm to any human being.”“Try your magic now,” he taunted. “I am sure my learned friend will consent toyou doing so.”“I absolutely refuse.”Justice Swift intervened, stating, “We cannot turn this court into a temple, Mr.O’Connor.”O’Connor nodded. “There is one other question. You said, Mr. Crowley, ‘On alater occasion I succeeded in rendering myself invisible.’ Would you like to trythat on? You appreciate that if you do not I shall denounce you as an impostor.”“You can denounce me as anything you like,” Crowley replied. “It will not alterthe truth.”“Have you at any time practiced black magic?” J. P. Eddy asked of his client forclarification.“No. I have always written in condemnation of black magic.”“What is the object of the magic in which you believe?”“My particular branch is the raising of humanity to higher spiritualdevelopment.”When Crowley prepared to leave the stand, Justice Swift asked one last question.“I would like to ask if Mr. Crowley could give the court the shortest and, atthe same time, most comprehensive definition of magic which he knows.”He happily obliged, quoting his own work on the subject. “Magick is the scienceand art of causing change to occur in conformation with the Will. It is whitemagic if the Will is righteous and black magic if the Will is perverse.”“Does it involve the invocation of spirits?” Swift asked.“It may do so. It does involve the invocation of the Holy Guardian Angel, who isappointed by Almighty God to watch over each of us.”“Then it does involve invocation of the spirits?”“Of one spirit. God is a spirit, and they that worship Him must worship Him inspirit and in truth.”“Is magic, in your view, the art of controlling spirits to affect the course ofevents?”“That is part of magic, one small branch.”“If the object of the control is good then it is white magic?”“Yes.”“And if the object of the control is bad, it is black magic?”“Yes.”“When the object of the control is bad, what spirits do you invoke?”This was becoming technical, and Crowley tried to be clear. “You cannot invokeevil spirits; you must evoke them or call them out.”“When the object is bad, you evoke evil spirits?”“You put yourself in their power. In that case, it is possible to control, orbind, evil spirits for a good purpose, as we might if we use the dangerouselements of fire and electricity for heating and lighting, and so on.”“Thank you.”After two days of testimony, Crowley stepped down from the witness stand.Karl Germer appeared on the stand as a character witness for Crowley. WhenMartin O’Connor cross-examined Germer, he asked incredulously, “Have you everseen Mr. Crowley invoke spirits?”“Yes.”“What spirits?”He answered proudly, “The spirit of magnanimity.”“How do you know it was the spirit of magnanimity?”“I suppose you have got to be sensitive in order to perceive.”Justice Swift asked Germer, “Can you point to any difference between the spiritof magnanimity and the spirit of hospitality?”Karl mused and answered, “I think that is very easy.”O’Connor pressed him, “You are sure it was the spirit of magnanimity which came,and not the spirit of hospitality?”The highlight of this ridiculous bit of testimony, according to an observer, was“the unforgettable scene of an Irish barrister requesting a German witness toread an alleged obscene poem that Crowley had written in French.”6[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c19-nts006][images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_080_r1.jpg]Images from the trial (left to right): Aleister Crowley giving the sign ofsilence; Betty May; and Karl Germer. (photo credit 1.1)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c01-fig001a]It was Friday the 13th. As Justice Swift predicted, the trial entered its fourthday. Betty May had been called by the defense, and J. P. Eddy attemptedunsuccessfully to discredit her the same way the defense had discreditedCrowley. An unexpected incident, especially damaging to Crowley, came out ofthis questioning. “In regard to your position in this case,” Eddy proposed, “Iput it to you plainly that you are here as a ‘bought’ witness.”“I am here to help the jury,” Betty May replied.“I am suggesting, without making any imputation against the solicitors, that youwere obviously unwilling to come unless you were paid to come.”“No.” She said she received £20 at most from the defendants’ solicitors.“What was it for?”“It was for my expenses.”“What expenses?”“I lived in the country and they wanted me in London, and they had to pay myexpenses.”“In reply,” Eddy addressed the court, “she received a letter stating, ‘I amafraid I cannot send you as much as another £5. I am grateful for your help, butI thought previous remittances covered a good deal.’ ” The reading of thatletter staggered everyone—the witness and the defense included. Betty Mayadmitted she received £5 from Messrs. Waterhouse, the solicitors. Withoutmissing a beat, he handed another letter to the witness and asked, “Are youknown as ‘Bumble Toff’?”“Lots of people call me by that name.”“Do you know anyone by the name of ‘Poddle Diff’?”“Yes, he is an old friend of mine.”“Is that letter signed by an old friend of yours?”“I don’t know, I have not seen him for so long.”“Do you swear you have not received that letter addressed to ‘dear BumbleToff’?”Before she could answer, Hilbery voiced an objection, which Swift sustained.“The witness says she does not remember receiving the letter,” the Justiceruled. “There the matter must stop.” Betty returned the letter to Eddy.“Did you not discuss with ‘Poddle Diff’ the question of your giving evidence inthis case?” Eddy asked.“No,” she answered. “He had enough troubles of his own without troubling aboutmine.”With that, Eddy rested his unusual cross-examination.Hilbery reexamined Betty, who stated she hadn’t seen the letters produced byEddy for a long time: they’d been removed from a small box of her personalpapers. “Did you ever authorize anyone to extract those documents from your boxof private papers and give them to Mr. Crowley?” Hilbery asked.“Certainly not.”Justice Swift asked, “Are these the ones produced by Mr. Crowley?”“Yes,” she answered.“Do you know how Mr. Crowley got possession of your letters?” Swift probed.“I cannot imagine how he got them.”“Were there other letters in the case?” Hilbery asked her.“Yes. Everything was taken from the case but the case was left. The contentswere all stolen.”Martin O’Connor opened the case for Nina Hamnett’s defense with an attack notonly of Crowley’s credibility but his very beliefs. “It is appalling that, inthis enlightened age a court should be investigating magic which is arch-humbugpracticed by arch-rogues to rob weak-minded people. I hope this action will endfor all time the activities of this hypocritical rascal. As to his reputation,there is no one in fact or in fiction against whom so much inquity has beenalleged. I suggest the jury stop this case, say they have heard enough of Mr.Crowley, and return a verdict for the defendants.”Noticing two jurors talking, Swift interrupted O’Connor’s statement. The twojurors looked up at Swift inquisitively. “Members of the jury,” he explained tothem, “I thought that you were speaking to each other.” After a few sheepishlooks, he added, “There is no reason why you should not whisper to him.”The foreman asked, “May I be given an opportunity to do so?”“I have stopped learned counsel so that you might speak to each other, if youwant to do so.”The jurors conferred; the foreman addressed the bench. “It is unanimous amongstthe jury to know whether this is a correct time for us to intervene.”“You cannot stop the case as against the defendants. You may stop it against theplaintiff when Mr. Eddy has said everything he wants to say.”Feeling success imminent, O’Connor added nothing more and called no evidence,passing the trial back to Eddy to close. He did his best to argue Crowley’scase. Sticking to strictly legal ground, he pointed out that no evidencesupported the allegation that a baby had disappeared from the Abbey, or thatlocal peasants were afraid of Crowley. Moreover, Mrs. Sedgwick’s testimony onthe events at Cefalù was wholly unreliable. “No reasonable jury can do otherthan find a verdict in favor of Mr. Crowley. The defendants’ viewsnotwithstanding, the law of libel is available to everybody, whether he is ofgood or bad character.”When Eddy finished, Swift addressed the jury. “Thirty minutes ago you intimatedto me that you had made up your minds about this case and that you did not wantto hear any more about it. I pointed out to you that before you could stop it,Mr. Eddy was entitled to address you. I also pointed out that before I couldtake your verdict I must be satisfied that you understand the issues you aretrying.“I have nothing to say about the facts except this: I have been over forty yearsengaged in the administration of the law in one capacity or another. I thought Iknew of every conceivable form of wickedness. I thought that everything whichwas vicious and bad had been produced at one time or another before me. I havelearnt in this case that we can always learn something if we live long enough. Ihave never heard such dreadful, horrible, blasphemous, and abominable stuff asthat which has been produced by the man who describes himself to you as thegreatest living poet.“If you think that the plaintiff fails on the ground that he was never libeled,or that his reputation was never damaged, or if you think the defendants havejustified what was written, then your verdict should be fore the defendants. Areyou still of the same mind or do you want the case to go on? If there is anydoubt about the matter, the case must go on.”They returned a unanimous verdict for the defendants with costs. Crowley hadlost.In retrospect, Crowley v Constable and Co. was a truly bizarre case. It isdifficult today to imagine the events of this trial: the notorious self-styledGreat Beast—who explained to the court that this name simply meant “LittleSunshine”—testifying on the differences between white and black magic; theprosecution challenging Crowley either to magically attack Malcolm Hilbery or torender himself invisible in the courtroom; poor Karl Germer being chided aboutthe differences between the spirit of magnanimity and the spirit of hospitality;and a stupefied Betty May being asked on the stand to admit to irrelevant petnames like “Poodle Diff” and “Bumble Toff” from stolen letters. In the end, thetrial was much like Jones v. The Looking Glass over two decades earlier: Crowleywas a person of such notoriously bad character that he had no basis for claimingdamage from what, to the jury, appeared to be factual statements. In this case,Crowley’s past failures to take legal action to protect his reputation workedagainst him. Ultimately, Hamnett’s book did not accuse Crowley of black magicbut reported what villagers near the Abbey purportedly believed.“Case violated by collapse of Swift & Nina. General joy—the consternation ofConstable & Co. & co.,” Crowley mysteriously recorded in his diary for Fridaythe 13th of April—a decidedly unlucky day. He filed out of the courtroom pastthe reporters who would plaster his name and face all over their papers. Hisonly remark, to the puzzlement of the paparazzi, was a quote from RudyardKipling’s “If”:If you can meet Triumph and DisasterAnd treat those two impostors just the same.After the trial, Robin Thynne introduced Crowley to his nineteen-year-oldmistress, Deirdre Patricia Maureen Doherty (b. 1915).7[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c19-nts007] Granddaughter and legal wardof Newlyn painter of children Thomas Cooper Gotch (1854-1931; Royal Society ofBritish Artists, Royal Institute of Painters in Watercolour), she had been sentto London to stay with a relative, Lord Justice Slesser. For her amusement,Slesser suggested she watch a trial in progress: Crowley v. Constable and Co.While they were, for the time being, casual acquaintances, “the girl Pat,” asCrowley would come to know her, would give AC the thing which neither Bill norPearl nor any other Scarlet Woman could: an heir."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTYTHE WAR OF THE ROSES (AND THE BATTLE OF THE BOOK)Even as his solicitors lodged a notice of appeal for the so-called “Black MagicLibel” case, Crowley felt repercussions from the trial. Arraigned on charges offeloniously receiving stolen letters—four originals and one copy—he pleaded notguilty and was released from the Marylebone police station on £10 bail until histrial. Although Kerman announced, “Mr. Crowley has a complete answer to thischarge,” Captain Eddie Cruze, from whom Crowley had purchased the letters to useagainst the Tiger Woman in court, was nowhere to be found despite a warrant forhis arrest.Judge Whiteley tried the case at the Old Bailey on July 24 and 25. AlthoughBetty (May) Sedgwick testified that Cruze had stolen the letters from herSeymour Street residence, Constantine Gallop (c. 1893–1967)1[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c20-nts001] argued on Crowley’s behalfthat she had given Cruze the letters as a guarantee of money she had promisedhim; and, since they were therefore his letters, he was free to pass them alongto Crowley.“Is this the first time there has been any charge against you in any place inthe world?” Gallop asked Crowley.“Yes,” he agreed.“Apart from the criticism justly or unjustly leveled against you for your book,has anything ever been leveled against your character in any court?”“Not in any court.”“Were you plaintiff in the action Constable and Another?”“I was and I am,” Crowley answered, alluding to his appeal.“In the course of that action, did you hear that Mrs. Sedgwick would probably becalled as a witness against you?”“Yes.” He testified that in December 1933 he learned that Cruze knew all abouther plans. “Betty May was preparing to commit perjury. That I already knew fromseveral sources.… I wanted to know whether these letters did prove the plans ofMrs. Sedgwick.” He paid £5 for the letters.“Did you at any time suspect that these letters had been stolen?”“No.”The jury deliberated half an hour before reaching a verdict. Believing BettyMay’s letters to be valueless, and hence useless as a security, they disbelievedCrowley’s story and found him guilty. Because of his clean record, JudgeWhiteley let him off lightly. “These letters ought not to have been used, oughtnever have been in your possession, or handed to your solicitor at all. However,they were used, and no harm had in fact been done; therefore I am not going tosend you to prison.” Whitely put AC on probation for two years and ordered himto pay fifty guineas toward costs for the prosecution.2[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c20-nts002]“Thank you, my Lord,” Crowley replied. In the back of his mind, however, he wasscreaming: “Idiots! Even a scapegoat is liable to butt.” He planned an appeal,but advised against it by both his lawyer and the I Ching, he dropped it.On November 8, however, Crowley’s appeal of the “Black Magic Trial” made it tocourt. After three days of testimony, Lord Justices Greer, Slesser, and Rochedecided that, although the case was well argued, it was unfair to take theobjectionable passages out of context, where they were clearly not libelous.They sustained Swift’s judgment and dismissed the case.3[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c20-nts003]The day after losing his appeal, Crowley, sick with pneumonia, was evicted fromhis room in Grosvenor Square. All told, 1934 had been a bad year.Another unfortunate upshot of Crowley’s popularity in the daily law reports wasthat his creditors now knew where to find him. On February 14, 1935, Crowleyfaced the Official Receiver as case number 38 in bankruptcy court, withliabilities from thirty-eight unsecured loans and ten partly secured loanstotaling £4,695. AC described himself as an author and psychiatrist. When askedwhy, during the years in which he was affluent, he never paid income tax,Crowley replied that he never received any forms, nor was he ever asked to paytaxes. Questioned about his lifestyle, he remarked that he always bought themost expensive clothing and paid £25 per pound for tobacco. Although he valuedhis stock of books at £20,000 and his life story at £2,000, he claimed to beunable to sell them because of a boycott of his works in England and the damagedone to his reputation by recent lawsuits. For these reasons, he had earned only£78 in book sales and £135 from articles since January 1932; loans and hisfamily trust covered his remaining expenses. He also blamed his insolvency onmismanagement by Yorke. “The assets comprised a large claim in a pending actionagainst a person now said to be in Shanghai,” Crowley reported, claiming thatonce the suit was settled he would again be solvent.At that, Yorke’s representatives, who attended the trial in case Yorke wasdragged into this, informed the Receiver that the claim to which Crowleyreferred was two years old and that he had made no attempts in that time topursue it. The receiver invited Crowley’s creditors to help him bring his caseto court and thereby reclaim their money. None took up the gauntlet.It was settled: Crowley was bankrupt. Finding he had no household furniture,creditors seized his manuscripts and diaries. (Fortunately, his trust fundpayments were not subject to this ruling.) Not until 1939 did he pay dividendson his debts, amounting to two pence on the pound.4[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c20-nts004]The last time Hayter Preston saw Aleister Crowley—in May 1914—they were arguingover Victor Neuburg. He never expected to hear from AC again, so his invitationto dine at the Old Ship in Brighton was too curious to pass up. Crowley’smotives, however, became clear once he pitched an article to Preston for theReferee. Nevertheless, he accepted and, after considerable editing, “MyWanderings in Search of the Absolute” appeared in the March 10, 1935, edition.It was a digest of Crowley’s early life, focusing on travel and mysticism.5[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c20-nts005]The next working day, AC strolled into the Referee offices wearing his blackHomburg hat. “These,” he said, depositing a stack of manuscripts on the editor’sdesk, “are the future installments of my article.” Crowley became livid whentold that the Referee wanted no other articles. He claimed Preston hadcontracted a series of articles, and if that agreement was broken, he would suefor breach of contract.And sue he did. As with his other lawsuits at this time, Crowley lost.Martha Küntzel had been overjoyed when Adolf Hitler became Führer on August 19,1933. She had considered Hitler her Magical Son, and intended to convert him toThelema because The Book of the Law claimed that the first nation to accept itwould rule the world. Although she attempted to get a copy of The Book of theLaw to Hitler in the 1920s—and Crowley heavily annotated a copy of HitlerSpeaks,6 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c20-nts006] claiming referencesto Thelema were interspersed throughout its pages—this was certainly not thecase. Hitler’s ideology was formed long before Küntzel entered the picture. TheNazis began gunning for magicians in 1933, first banning fortune-telling, nextconfiscating occult books and outlawing secret societies, and finallyimprisoning high-ranking occultists, including those from Freemasonry to theFraternitas Saturni. Eventually, Küntzel’s own papers—including the stock ofCrowley paintings stored with her after the Berlin exhibit—were seized anddestroyed. Although AC initially supported the idea of converting a politicalleader to Thelema, his support of Hitler quickly dissipated when the chancellorshowed his true colors.When the British Home Office refused to extend Karl Germer’s temporary visa, itforced him to return to Germany on February 2, 1935. He was arrested at arelative’s house in Leipzig on February 13, charged with having illegal Masonicconnections. He was taken first to Berlin, then to Esterwegen, a camp on theDutch frontier.Cora sought help from the American consul, but when she sent him a telegram fromthe States, the Nazis intercepted it and placed Karl in solitary confinement. Hemaintained his sanity by reciting the Thelemic Holy Books from memory andaspiring to his holy guardian angel. Cora’s constant inquiries to the Americanconsul finally resulted in Germer’s release on August 1. That he was a Germanand had served as a major during the Great War helped.A condition of his release forbade Germer to leave Germany and required him toreport his residence and movements regularly. Thus Karl took an apartment nearBelgium and reported it as per his parole, but also took another residence underan assumed name. One October night, he sneaked across the border to Belgium.Although he returned to England on a Belgian refugee passport, Germer wasultimately forced back to Belgium, where he stored his belongings and worked foran exporter of farm machinery in Brussels.On April 14, 1934—the day after Crowley lost his court case against Constableand Company—W. T. Smith incorporated the Church of Thelema. This act was a boneof contention because Crowley wanted his American students to incorporate OTO,while Smith and Jacobi both argued that a church would net them tax-exemptstatus.In June 1935, Smith wrote to Crowley about an influx of students to their group.C. F. Russell had set up his own OTO spin-off groups, “The Choronzon Club” and“G[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]B[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]G[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg],”which advertised a shortcut to initiation. “It appears that, in a few shortweeks, one may become 7°=4° or more,” Smith wrote.7[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c20-nts007] It had started five yearspreviously—in spring 1930—when Russell wrote a series of articles for Chicago’sThe Occult Digest.8 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c20-nts008] Coincidingwith his first article, “Viens,” in May 1930, he began running a banner ad thatread:SPECIAL NOTICE TO ADVANCED STUDENTSWe will disclose a short cut to INITIATION to ALL those who are willing toperform THE GREAT WORK! Here is the TEST. Can you do exactly as you are told,just one simple easy thing and KEEP SILENT FOREVER about your success? Then sendyour name and address with one dollar to C. F. Russell, Secretary.CHORONZON CLUB, P. O. Box 181, ChicagoMAKE SURE YOU KNOW YOUR OWN MIND BEFORE YOU ANSWER!This ad ran for twenty-six months, from May 1930 to June 1932. The followingmonth he switched to a new banner ad which ran until February 1933:THERE IS A SHORTCUT TO INITIATIONThe ANCIENT WAY to the Adeptship and beyond the ULTIMATE ATTAINMENT is nowopened to Members of the CHORONZON CLUB by a scientific technic based on theSupreme Secret of all PRACTICAL MAGICK. The enrollment fee is one dollar. Thefinal fee is six dollars. There are absolutely no further fees, dues or alms ofany kind. Our business is to Initiate, not to make money. If you are willing todo exactly as you are told and can keep silence, apply today to any Member inyour own town or send your application with the enrollment fee directly to:MR. C. F. RUSSELL, Secretary, P. O. Box 181, Chicago.After that, he ran a series of shorter classified ads that ran until December1933.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_081_r1.jpg]C. F. Russell’s later advertisements in The Occult Digest for the Choronzon Club(clockwise from upper left: June, September, October, and November/December,1933). (photo credit 22.1) [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c22-fig001a]From what Smith had gathered, the system provided financial incentives forpeople to initiate more members and set up more lodges: while membership cost$1, the Lodgemasters split the $6 Neophyte initiation fee with Russell inChicago. The group boasted five hundred members in Denver alone. However,Russell announced the beginning of the order’s five years of silence thatsummer: no more initiations would take place, and all typescript instructionswere to be returned or destroyed. In response, members flocked to Crowley’sgroup.Appalled by the details of Russell’s activities, Crowley asked Jane Wolfe totalk sense into him. When Russell refused to cooperate, Crowley expelled himfrom OTO and circulated the following encyclical:To those whom it may concern,The Master Therion warns all aspirants to the Sacred Wisdom and the Magick ofLight that initiation cannot be bought or even conferred. It must be won bypersonal endeavour. Members of the true Order of theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]are pledged to zeal and service to those whom they supervise, and to accept noreward of any kind for such service. Nor does the Order receive any feeswhatsoever when degrees of initiation are conferred by its authority.He especially warns all persons against C.F. Russell of Chicago, Illinois, andhis agents. He is a thief, swindler, and blackmailer. He has stolen the propertyof the Order, and used it to enable him to pose as its representative and so tocarry on his swindles upon would-be initiates. Russell is a man of no education;he cannot even spell correctly. Steps have already been taken to prosecute himfor his frauds.Therion.Aleister Crowley.9 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c20-nts009]That fall, far from the depredations of the German war machine, OTO took itsfirst steps in California. On September 21 at 7 p.m., Jane Wolfe escorted sevenaspirants into the desert. Here, Smith, Schneider, Jacobi, and Kahl conductedthe 0° initiation, admitting the seven seekers into the OTO grade of Minerval.Afterwards, Smith announced the name of their lodge: Agape. It was the Greekword for “love,” and, like thelema, added to 93.At this time, a war that had nothing to do with Hitler or Europe raged. Thebattlefield was the United States, but the combatants never faced each other,and no casualties resulted. Sounding like the 1910 Mathers v. Crowley case, bothsides of the skirmish—the Fraternitas Rosae Crucis (FRC) and the Ancient andMystical Order Rosæ Crucis (AMORC)—deemed themselves the “true” RosicrucianOrder and their opponents “Black Magicians.”The Pennsylvania-based FRC was descended from Paschal Beverly Randolph(1825–1875), whose psychosexual doctrines in Eulis!10[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c20-nts010] and other books influenced OTOsystem of sex magic. Randolph had received a charter from the SocietasRosicruciana, and over the years the mantle of leadership passed to Freeman B.Dowd then to R. Swinburne Clymer (1878–1966). Now Clymer was slugging it outwith a Mr. Lewis.Before H. Spencer Lewis (1883–1939) founded AMORC in 1915, he was simply HarveyLewis, illustrator for a New York mystery magazine. He was initiated into aFrench Rosicrucian tradition in 1909, then founded his own branch in the UnitedStates. As mentioned previously, he met Crowley in New York in 1918, shortlybefore moving the AMORC headquarters to California, where it has flourished eversince. Crowley had recognized Lewis as an honorary VII° and in 1921 TheodorReuss issued a “Gauge of Amity” stating that OTO and AMORC worked alongcooperative lines. Since his degree was honorary, Lewis took no initiation orinstruction; it was simply Crowley’s (and, later, Reuss’s) recognition ofLewis’s other accomplishments to which the VII° corresponded. Lewis admittedlydrew on Crowley, Eckartshausen and Franz Hartmann as sources of information, andeven borrowed the GD’s Rosy Cross and the Thelemic motto “Love is the law, loveunder will.” In his Militia (1933), Lewis claimed his authority derived fromOTO.Clymer, having read and thoroughly misunderstood Crowley, accused Lewis offollowing the tenets of a black sex magician. Ironically, Clymer’s organization,descended from Randolph—who was, in turn, one source of OTO’s sex magicalteachings—denied and shunned Randolph’s doctrines and branded them evil. Todiscredit Lewis as head of a competing Rosicrucian organization, Clymer issued atwo-volume diatribe titled The Rosicrucian Fraternity in America.11[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c20-nts011] Its sole purpose was to exposeLewis and the people connected to him. Lewis responded to these attacks bypublishing Audi Alteram Partem—also known as White Book “D”—sending copies tovarious libraries and adding another stack of paper to the fire.12[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c20-nts012] Next, Crowley added gasoline.In Crowley’s opinion, Lewis’s sole authority stemmed from OTO. Reuss had givenLewis a diploma and, now that Crowley was OHO, Lewis was acting “entirelywithout my knowledge and approval, in complete disregard of, and in oppositionto, my principles.”13 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c20-nts013] Thesolution was simple: Since Lewis owed everything he had to OTO, Crowley proposedthat he give it all back to OTO. The entirety of AMORC and its property wasvalued at £150,000 (about $7 million by contemporary standards). Crowley therebyhoped to run AMORC honestly and to dispense authentic teachings. To get his way,he was prepared to go to the Federal Trade Commission and if necessary to go toCalifornia himself.Correspondence proved fruitless. Lewis argued that even if Crowley did controlOTO and the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim, AMORC was Rosicrucian, not Masonic.Furthermore, American Masons recognized neither OTO nor Memphis-Mizraim. In theend, Lewis saw Crowley making claims without documentation of his authority,running a spurious British order—and he claimed to have correspondence withReuss and Krumm-Heller to prove it. Crowley, however, was also in contact withKrumm-Heller, writing:Spencer Louis [sic] was never a disciple, either of Reuss or myself in any senseof the term. He had been knocking about for years trying to run a fakeRosicrucian Order. He cast about everywhere for authority and when I first methim in New York in 1918 E.V., he was showing a charter supposed to be from theFrench Rosicrucians in Toulouse. He devoted so much time to the conquest of theinnermost secrets of nature that he had not been able to spend any to learnFrench. Now even in New York there are a few people who know French and thisridiculous forgery made him a general laughing stock so that he withdrew it.Now in the last 2 or 3 years of his life Peregrinus Reuss was sick, impoverishedand desperate. He was anxious at any cost to find people to carry on his work.He, accordingly, handed out honorary diplomas up to the 95th degree andsometimes very foolishly the 96th. That is how people like Spencer Lewis andTränker get their standing.…It is amusing to notice that my own personal seal is on the documents quoted byLewis as his authority and the words ‘Ordo Templi Orientis’ are sprawled allover the document … Either he had no authority at all or he had mine. If he hadnone he can be prosecuted, if he had mine he must account for the 900,000dollars odd which he had amassed in the last few years.14[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c20-nts014]To get the wheels moving, Crowley circulated this document:MEMORANDUMAleister Crowley is the head of the O.T.O. (Ordo Templi Orientis).His authority is sole and supreme, and the property of the Order is vested inhimself and his Grand Officers, who are his nominees.The Order is international in scope.A Mr. H. Lewis Spencer has been in control of an Order with headquarters inCalifornia under the title of AMORC. His authority is, however, derived from theO.T.O.The property of the AMORC is, therefore, by the Constitution of the Order,legally the property of Mr. Aleister Crowley.The real and personal property of the AMORC is estimated at $900,000 by hisex-Grand Treasurer, and its annual income is said to amount to about $350,000.Mr. Crowley proposes to go to California and claim the property.…There should be no difficulty in getting lawyers in San Francisco or Los Angelesto undertake the prosecution of the claim on a contingent basis.…[Mr. Crowley’s] ultimate aim is to establish the Order on a large scale in theU.S.A. and elsewhere, on a basis of the most scrupulous honesty.We require $5,000 to finance Mr. Crowley’s journey.The details of this proposition, with documentary corroboration, will be shownto interested parties on application, and if a satisfactory basis of action canbe agreed, the terms of the loan will be discussed by us on his behalf.15[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c20-nts015]When Lewis suffered a stroke around this time, Crowley wrote to Smith, “This iswhere you jump in and file a claim on my behalf to the whole property of theAMORC.”16 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c20-nts016] Alas, like so manyof AC’s schemes, this never transpired.Over the past two years, Crowley and Pearl tried desperately to conceive a childtogether. Yet AC’s diary notes with disappointment the start of her everyperiod. Then, on January 14, 1936, Pearl went into the hospital. The followingday, doctors removed her uterus and fallopians. While Crowley loved her andstood by her, he realized she could never be the mother of his child.As fate would have it, Patricia Doherty reentered the picture. Her relationshipwith the much older Thynne ended with his death in 1935. She mournfully traveledabroad, returning to England in spring 1936. She looked up Crowley and resumed aplatonic friendship with him … until that summer when out of the blue he askedher to bear his child. She agreed, and on May 2, 1937, Deirdre produced anheir.17 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c20-nts017]Crowley inaugurated 1936 with yet another pastime: cooking. Though he had been abit of a chef in the past, this time he was serious. He planned to start “TheExotic Restaurant”—another pipe dream. Nevertheless, he delighted the palates ofhis many friends, with Louis Wilkinson ranking him among the best cooks in theworld and Clifford Bax reporting AC’s to be “the most delicious curry which Ihave tasted.”18 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c20-nts018] This samecurry was reputedly so spicy that decades ago it sent Eckenstein headlong into asnowbank in search of relief.His first dinner for Charles Richard Cammell—remembered today as a poet of bothchildren’s verse and of World War I—was a gastronomic spectacle. They’d met at aluncheon with their mutual friend Gwen Otter where Crowley impressed Cammell bycorrectly guessing his sun sign. “How did you guess?” the dumbfounded poetasked.“I didn’t guess,” Crowley replied blankly. “I knew.”Shortly thereafter, AC called him with a dinner invitation. Asked if he likedcurry, the poet, a connoisseur of spicy food, taunted Crowley with the response,“Yes, but very mild please.” Crowley, of course, conjured his most infernalcurry, which to his surprise Cammell devoured with impunity. Astonished that hisliquid fire had failed to burn a hole in Cammell’s tender tongue, he finallyasked, “Did you like it?”“It was delicious,” Cammell remarked.“Not too hot?”“No, not at all. In fact, it was rather mild.”Mild? “Would you like more?”“Please, and make it plenty.”This was all too much. “I suppose you’d like some vodka after your wine.”“Yes,” he nodded, “I would.”19 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c20-nts019]With that, Cammell passed into the ranks of Crowley’s closest friends.The Great Beast seemed to be vanishing into a purely mythical status. His lastbook had appeared in 1930 when Mandrake Press was still a going concern. Sincethen he had published almost nothing. Only the newspapers kept him in the publiceye. Thus Crowley began working in the spring of 1936 on a republication of TheBook of the Law that would do the book justice. He wanted to publish the textalong with a complete account of its receipt and a thorough commentary on itscontents—just as Aiwass had instructed him to do thirty-two years ago. Afacsimile of the original pages, again according to Aiwass’s instructions, wouldbe included. However, such a tome was more than just The Book of the Law, andonly one title fit this sweeping collection of papers. Crowley prepared topublish it as The Equinox, Volume III Number 3, otherwise known as The Equinoxof the Gods.This new Equinox was a different breed from its predecessor. It had nocontributions from other authors; neither poetry, plays, nor short stories; noserialized features; no book reviews; and most significantly, no plan of regularpublication. He had no idea how often he could bring issues out. Thus TheEquinox became an irregular publication, each issue a self-contained book withits own title and format. Crowley designed a prospectus and subscription formfor the book in June. On the 25th, after minor difficulties with his printer,the four-page flyer was completed.On April 8, 9 and 10, 1904 e.v.20[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c20-nts020] this book was dictated to 666(Aleister Crowley) by Aiwass, a Being whose nature he does not fully understand,but who described Himself as “the Minister of Hoor-Paar-Kraat” (the Lord ofSilence)The contents of the book prove to strict scientific demonstration that Hepossesses knowledge and power quite beyond anything that has been hithertoassociated with human faculties.The circumstances of the dictation are described in The Equinox, Vol I, No. vii:but a fuller account, with an outline of the proof of the character of the book,is now here to be issued.The book announces a New Law for mankind.It replaces the moral and religious sanctions of the past, which have everywherebroken down, by a principle valid for each man and woman in the world, andself-evidently indefeasible.The spiritual Revolution announced by the book has already taken place: hardly acountry where it is not openly manifest.Ignorance of the true meaning of this new Law has led to gross anarchy. Itsconscious adoption in its proper sense is the sole cure for the political,social and racial unrest which have brought about the World War, the catastropheof Europe and America, and the threatening attitude of China, India and Islam.Its solution of the fundamental problems of mathematics and philosophy willestablish a new epoch in history.But it must not be supposed that so potent an instrument of energy can be usedwithout danger.I summon, therefore, by the power and authority entrusted to me, every greatspirit and mind now on this planet incarnate to take effective hold of thistranscendent force, and apply it to the advancement of the welfare of the humanrace.For as the experience of these two and thirty years has shown too terribly, thebook cannot be ignored. It has leavened Mankind unaware: and Man must makethereof the Bread of Life. Its ferment has begun to work on the grape ofthought: Man must obtain therefrom the Wine of Ecstasy.Come then, all ye, in the Name of the Lord of the Aeon, the Crowned andConquering Child, Heru-Ra-Ha: I call ye to partake this Sacrament.Know—will—dare—and be silent!The book was priced at eleven shillings (eleven being a key number in Crowley’smagick), with an autumnal equinox publication date.Within two days of receiving the prospectuses, he sent out nearly three hundredcopies. He sold twenty-five books to poet and occultist Michael Juste, who,under his given name Michael Houghton (died. c. 1956), was the proprietor ofLondon’s Atlantis Bookshop, which he, an Eastern European refugee, founded in1922. By June 29 subscription checks began coming. On July 9, Simpkin Marshallagreed to distribute the book. Things were going his way.While Crowley got his destiny firmly in hand, Pearl was quickly losing her grip.Her uncontrollable visions from the early part of their relationship became whatCrowley called “almost constant hallucinations.” On May 12 he recorded in hisdiary that she was “showing serious symptoms of insanity.” Granted that afterthree years of trying to conceive a child with Crowley, she’d just had ahysterectomy and was experiencing tremendous hormonal and psychological changes.Then, on June 14, a woman she had never seen before—Elsie Morris—came by andinsisted Crowley had gotten her pregnant that January; while Crowleynonchalantly replied, “Possible, but I paid 5 shillings at the time,”21[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c20-nts021] it rubbed Pearl’s nose in herperceived biological inadequacy. Then there was Pat (Deirdre MacAlpine), who wasout to have the baby she could never have. Pearl was more than jealous: sheresented and loathed Pat for being able to give Crowley the one precious thingshe could not.A firm kick awakened AC on June 25. Another soon followed before he realizedthat Pearl was thrashing about in her sleep, bedeviled by a nightmare. Havingworked late that night, he was too exhausted to do anything but wait for theepisode to subside; but after forty-five minutes, he crawled out of bed and intohis sitting room. Then Pearl burst in, gesticulating and shouting, “You shan’tsleep all night unless you come back to bed!” Crowley was speechless. When shestarted crying and apologizing, he thought it was just as bad. When he finallyslipped into sleep at 4 o’clock, he told himself, “This won’t do.”Alas the violent dreams continued, infrequent at first but growing more commonas the weeks passed. By August they occurred regularly:August 1, 1936. A hellish night. Kicked out—much harder kicking thanbefore—slept in chair? No! She started screaming & rushed in.August 2. To sleep. More violence.August 3. Pat to lunch. Foul remarks by Pearl.August 4. Kicked more violently than ever: much of it awake and deliberate.August 7. New nightmare of Pearl’s.August 19. 3rd Anniversary of Pearl … Pearl gave adequate demonstration of thekicking, moaning & muttering. Perhaps people will believe me in future.August 21. Pearl till 3 a.m. wakened by sudden & violent physical attack. Sheremembers nothing before finding herself in the room remaking the bed.Pearl had snapped, and Crowley felt he might also.On August 30 he moved out of what he called the “Doomed Bastion” and into Room 6on 56 Welbeck Street. His new landlord was Allan Burnett-Rae, whom Crowley hadmet a few years previously at the Mayfair Hotel during one of Dr. Cannon’s teas.Crowley wore the same knickerbocker suit he had worn then—it, his books, asthmamachine, and incense burner were his only remaining worldly possessions.Alas, trouble followed. “Pearl started her Macbeth act,” Crowley wrote in hisdiary for September 3. “Had to throw her out. She fought like a tiger-cat. Hellto pay in house.” Tenants’ complaints resulted in Burnett-Rae storming upstairsand pounding on the door; judging from the noise, he assumed Beast was beatingher. “Crowley!” he demanded. “Open this door!” When Pearl opened the door andapologetically explained that Mr. Crowley was having a nightmare, he believednone of it and insisted they see him in the morning.Crowley and Pearl rose early the next day and ordered tea in their room. Whenthe waiter arrived, Pearl screamed at him, “Go and shit yourself!” Crowley didhis best to calm her before meeting their landlord. Burnett-Rae hadn’t evendressed when they called on him. Taking the rap for Pearl, Crowley explained tohim that he had, in fact, had a nightmare. They were rare, and he promised itwould never happen again. Convinced Crowley had been beating her, Burnett-Raeinsisted they pay their rent immediately or be expelled. Crowley spoke vaguelyof money from American supporters and a family trust, and Burnett-Rae preparedfor the unpleasant business of eviction.After the meeting, AC sent Pearl away for a bit so he could continue his magicalwork. Then he met again with his landlord, paid him cash for the rent, andcleared things up about Pearl. Burnett-Rae told Crowley he could stay—he wouldeven tolerate his incense—if Crowley promised to stop sending his helper Adolpheout for pigs’ trotters in the dead of night. Crowley agreed.This, combined with failing health, marked the beginning of Pearl’s inexorablepassing out of Crowley’s life.As the autumnal equinox approached that September, Crowley was quite busy.Despite previous failures in both Berlin and London, Crowley sought a play orfilm deal for Mortadello. Asked to produce the play, athlete, actor, scholar,and civil rights activist Paul Robeson (1898–1976) smiled and politely shook hishead; he later confided in Cammell, “There are certain lines and gestures whichthe British public would not care to see enacted between a Negro and a whitewoman. As for the American stage, why, if I were to produce it there, somebodyin the audience would stand up and shoot me with a revolver.”22[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c20-nts022]By September 18, despite difficulties with papermakers and printers, Crowleyheld an advance copy of The Equinox of the Gods, his first book in six years.Germer, visiting from Brussels, bought dinner for the celebration. On September23, 1936, the book was officially released. Selling at one guinea, it was anopulent volume: the pages were large—quarto in size—on handmade Japanese paper.The white buckram cover was stamped with gilt lettering. In a pocket in the backof the book was a facsimile reproduction of the manuscript of The Book of theLaw. Its contents included an extract from “Aha!,” the text of The Book of theLaw, a brief account of Crowley’s life, and the comment that emerged from theCephaloedium Working. Although some typos marred this edition, one has becomelegendary: The plate of the Stele of Revealing was ironically mislabeled “TheStele of Revelling.” The book sold well, and Crowley contemplated the need for asecond printing.The autumnal equinox was indeed a special day for Crowley. His new book was out.That morning, he had a vision of four adepts representing four races of manpresenting him with the Word of the Equinox. Then, celebrating with Pat thatday, he first learned that she was pregnant.Internal strife wracked Agape Lodge in California. Regina had entered an asylumlate in 1935, shortly after Smith tried to seduce her. Schneider, who neverseemed to be around anymore, blamed the Lodgemaster for her fate. Then, inAugust 1936, Jacobi flipped. It began on Thursday night, August 13, when Smithreceived an anonymous phone tip: Jacobi was under investigation by hisemployers, the gas company, for living openly with a woman and for belonging toan immoral order wherein candidates for initiation were stripped naked. He wascertain to lose his job.23 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c20-nts023]Smith, of course, immediately phoned Jacobi (Jake) with the information.The next night, members of Agape Lodge anxiously awaited Jacobi’s arrival. Aletter arrived special delivery in his stead, stating he had severed hisrelations with his friends and OTO. Although Smith contacted Jacobi, urging himto stick to his principles and speak to his boss, they heard nothing from himuntil August 20. “Regina saw him last night, and he would hardly open the carwindow to talk to her,” Smith reported. “In almost a frantic way, he told her hewas through with us all, and did not want to see any of us again, that he wouldsend all of the books of the order to you, a copy of Oo and I°.”24[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c20-nts024]Outraged by this news and by Schneider’s lurid reports about Smith, Crowleypromptly sent a vicious letter to the Agape Lodgemaster, accusing him of runningOTO as a racket to sell sex. He declared the Lodge at Winona Boulevardoff-limits until matters were cleared up and said, “If you have a defense, youbetter cable me.”25 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c20-nts025] AlthoughSmith promptly cabled Crowley that he was astounded beyond measure—denying thecharges, professing his loyalty, and promising to write fully—AC simply rebukedhim for sending such a long and costly telegram. Regarding charges oftrafficking in sex, Smith wrote to Crowley, “in the last 20 years, up to lastSunday as a matter of fact, I have defended so many of the same and otherattacks on yourself that I got quite hardened and merely considered thesource.”26 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c20-nts026]When Jane Wolfe sided with Smith and repudiated Max’s report, Schneider brokeoff from the Lodge, taking most of the students with him. Before long, othermembers—presumably warned off by Schneider—began avoiding the Lodge. On November7, Smith wrote to Crowley that he was suspending the Lodge until they had abetter core of initiates to work with.Back in 1934, Crowley’s former secretary Israel Regardie had joined the StellaMatutina branch of the GD with Crowley’s blessing. His introduction came fromoccultist Dion Fortune (1890–1946), who had long admired Regardie’s first twobooks, writing glowing appraisals of them in the Occult Review. Although Waitehad considerably revised, polished, and Christianized the rituals from theiroriginal Isis-Urania form, they deeply impressed Regardie.In the following years he published GD influenced books like My RosicrucianAdventure (1936) and The Golden Dawn (1936). The latter four-volume setcontained the complete rituals and instructions of the Outer Order of the GD,and it quickly became a classic. Crowley, however, considered the book “puretheft”—particularly ironic since Crowley pirated much of “The Temple of Solomonthe King” from Mathers.Crowley, noting Regardie’s pen name “Francis,” wrote a glib letter to “Frank,”chiding his former pupil about his Jewish faith and inferiority complex.Regardie took criticism poorly, and the jeering struck his insecurities like asledgehammer. He rifled off a nasty retort, beginning with “Darling Alice, Youreally are a contemptible bitch!”27[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c20-nts027] It infuriated the Beast;perhaps, as Crowley’s letter triggered Regardie’s insecurities, something aboutthis struck a nerve in him. In response, AC circulated a cruel letter aboutRegardie:Israel Regudy was born in the neighborhood of Mile End Road, in one of thevilest slums in London.Of this fact he was morbidly conscious, and his racial and social shameembittered his life from the start.“Regardie” is the blunder of a recruiting sergeant in Washington on the occasionof his brother enlisting in the United States Army. Regudy adopted this error assounding less Jewish. “Francis” which he has now taken appears to be a pureinvention.About the year 1924 he began to study the work of, and corresponded with, Mr.Aleister Crowley. He put up so plausible an appeal that the latter gentlemanpaid his passage from America and accepted him as a regular student of Magic.Apart from his inferiority complex, he was found to be suffering from severechronic constipation, and measures were taken to cure him of this and also hisingrained habit of onanism.The cure in the latter case was successful, but Regudy abused his freedom bygoing under some railway arches and acquiring an intractable gonorrhoea.28[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c20-nts028]This incident so embittered Regardie that he never again communicated withCrowley. Thirty years would pass before he overcame his resentment and regainedhis appreciation for Crowley.With the popularity of the phonograph, Crowley spent that autumn cutting somewax 78 rpm records of himself reciting poetry and invocations. On November 18and 19 he did the first and second Enochian Calls, followed on the 23rd by the“Anthem” from “The Ship” and “Hymn to Pan.” On December 1 he recorded “Hymn forJuly 4” and some other pieces. “I did make a record of the ‘Hymn to Pan,’ ”Crowley reported, “5 minutes all, but for 2 or 3 seconds continuous roaring andraging, so my lungs are not quite done for. The magical effect of that recordingwill soon be seen in London.”29[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c20-nts029]That winter he returned to the more familiar role of teacher, appearing at theEiffel Tower on Wednesday, January 13, 1937, to give his first of four lectureson “Yoga for Yellowbellies.” Crowley thought the talk went well, but it was anuncharacteristic understatement. His talks on yoga, given twenty-seven yearsafter he wrote about it in Book Four, rank among the best available expositions:lucid, direct, and good-humored.The remaining talks followed on January 20, January 25, and February 3. Sofavorable was the response that Crowley ran a second series of four lectures,“Yoga for Yahoos.” Beginning at the Eiffel Tower on February 17, the talks wereevery bit as sublime and witty as their predecessors—perhaps too clever. Duringhis second lecture on February 24, Crowley found his audience staring blankly athim; Cammell thought they couldn’t distinguish his learned words from deadpanone-liners. To remedy this, Crowley paused at odd intervals and blurted out, “Tohell with the Archbishop of Canterbury!” Instead of waking the audience, he onlyconfused them more. The third and fourth lectures followed on successiveWednesdays. Crowley offered the lectures to Daily Express reporter Tom Driberg,but the paper passed on the opportunity to print them. Someday, he thought, hewould have to publish them himself.Although May 2, 1937, was one of the happiest days in Crowley’s life, hisdiaries are curiously silent on the matter. With no miscarriages orcomplications, Pat MacAlpine gave birth to a healthy baby boy atNewcastle-on-Tyne. Crowley had the heir he had sought. Contrary to popularrumor, he did not name the boy Mustapha because on seeing the mother for thefirst time he said, “I must ’ave ’er.” The mother named him Randall GairDoherty, although Crowley would carry on the tradition that left AC with hisfather’s name, nicknaming the boy Aleister Ataturk.30[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c20-nts030] A celebration followed thenext day.Since the start of 1937, Crowley was absorbed in the study of the Chinese oracleof I Ching, making some incisive observations and arriving at new theories. OnJune 7 Crowley recovered his I Ching sticks—a set of six turtle shell rectangleswith a solid line on one side and a broken line on the other. This apparatus,which diverged from the traditional method of using fifty-one yarrow wands toproduce a series of six broken, unbroken, and moving lines, provided a quick anddirty way of casting a hexagram. From this point on, Crowley consulted the IChing daily for a general hexagram, and deferred to the Chinese oracle for manyother decisions.On June 9, Crowley met Clifford Bax for lunch at the Royal Automobile Club.Although over thirty years had passed since he and Bax first met at St. Moritz,when Crowley was a newlywed and Bax but a boy, they were still good friends.“What has happened to the Queen of Heaven?” Bax would ask Crowley, who drylyrequested, “Year and name, please.”That afternoon, three ladies escorted Bax to lunch. The first, artist LeslieBlanche,31 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c20-nts031] Bax introduced as“la Comtesse de Roussy de Sales,” but Crowley knew Bax was merely attempting totitillate him. Next was Meum Stewart,32[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c20-nts032] who spent much of the lunchasking for details about Raoul Loveday’s death. The last of these women, olderand more staid, was Lady Harris.Marguerite Frieda Harris, née Bloxham (1877–1962), was the daughter of CharingCross Hospital’s consulting surgeon John Astley Bloxham (1843–1926) and wife ofSir Percy Harris (1876–1952), a member of Parliament. It was only a few yearsago, in 1932, that Percy Harris was created a baronet, thus making his wife“Lady Harris” (although she preferred to eschew the formal title). She was alsoan artist, having illustrated her book Winchelsea: A Legend (1926) and havingexhibited at the New English Art Club in 1929 under the name Jesus Chutney.33[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c20-nts033] Lady Harris also professed aninterest in magick: having at one time been an adherent of Mary Baker Eddy’sChristian Science, she would, at other points in her life, study Anthroposophy,Co-Masonry, Thelema, and Indian mysticism.34[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c20-nts034] As her friend, sculptor EdwardBainbridge Copnall (1903–1973), described her, “She had an alive and virilebrain, though she was inclined to be very absent-minded, and a most amusingsense of humour and a love of the bizarre.”35[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c20-nts035] Bax had invited her at thelast minute as an afterthought, and she failed to impress AC, who recorded theirmeeting only scantily in his diary. Nobody imagined that she would play a rolein Crowley’s life every bit as important as Allan Bennett, George Cecil Jones,J. F. C. Fuller, Victor Neuburg, Leah Hirsig, Gerald Yorke, or Karl Germer.For the next few weeks, the I Ching was right on the money for Crowley. When, onJune 25, he met Bobby Barefoot, he asked for a symbol for their relationship.Kwai, hexagram forty-three, came the response. Crowley interpreted thiscorrectly as “Plain fucking and no more.” She became one of several womenCrowley bounced between in his sixty-second year. On August 9, AC got the firsthexagram, and Frieda Harris contacted him again through Leslie Blanche. WhenCrowley received the second hexagram the next day, he noted in his diary, “Ithink I and II coming like this should announce a totally new current prepared,without my will or knowledge, by the Gods.”36[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c20-nts036]That fall found Crowley in a publishing frenzy. He not only corrected pageproofs for his next book, The Heart of the Master, but was also preparing asecond printing of The Equinox of the Gods. When Simpkin Marshall threatened torenege on their agreement to distribute the reissue, on December 10 AC changedhis personal British Monomark Corporation box BM JPKH to the commercial addressBCM/ANKH through which to sell this and future books. The second printing of TheEquinox of the Gods would appear in two formats: a standard issue uniform inpaper and binding with the first edition; and a less elaborate subscriber’sedition of 250 copies on machine-made paper with cloth-backed boards, priced ateleven shillings. The production cost of both editions was roughly £400; thoseexpenses not covered by subscriptions were paid by Pearl and OTO donations fromCalifornia.Crowley’s publication announcement for this edition of The Equinox of the Godswas more dramatic than that for the first printing:THE FIRST PUBLICATIONnine months before the outbreak of the Balkan War, which broke up the Near East,When this was done, it was done without proper perfection. Its commands as tohow the work ought to be done were not wholly obeyed.… Yet, even so, theintrinsic power of the truth of the Law and the impact of publication weresufficient to shake the world, so that a critical war broke out, and the mindsof men were moved in a mysterious manner.THE SECOND PUBLICATIONnine months before the outbreak of the World War, which broke up the West.The second blow was struck by the re-publication of the Book in September, 1913,and this time … caused a catastrophe to civilisation. At this hour, the MasterTherion is concealed, collecting his forces for a final blow. When the Book ofthe Law and its Comment is published … in perfect obedience to theinstructions … the result will be incalculably effective. The event willestablish the kingdom of the Crowned and Conquering Child over the whole earth,and all men shall bow to the Law, which is love under will.”Magick, pp 112–113, written in 1922 published in 1929.THE THIRD PUBLICATIONnine months before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War which is breaking upthe Far East.THE FOURTH PUBLICATION6:22 a.m., December 22, 1937 e.v.Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.The world is stricken to-day by an epidemic of madness.… On every side we areconfronted by evidence of insanity which is sweeping across the earth like apestilence.Murder and terror in Soviet Russia; Concentration Camps and persecution inGermany; war fever and blood lust in Italy and Japan; civil war in Spain;economic crisis in U.S.A.; recurrent strikes and labour discontent inFrance—there is no corner of the Globe untouched!What is the cause?The old standards of human conduct, the ancient religions which have servedhumanity for thousands of years, have broken down.…The old order has broken down, and mankind is searching frantically for aformula which will take its place—a standard of human conduct independent oftradition and dogma which will stand up to the stress of modern conditions, andcreate a new engine for the further progress of mankind.The Bible, the Koran and other codes are proving incapable of resisting theshattering effect of modern thought; humanity is drifting rudderless through astormy sea of doubt and despair. Belief is bewildered. Conviction is shaken. Butthere is a way out!A universal law for all nations, classes and races is here. It is the Charter ofUniversal Freedom.“The Law of Thelema,” revealed in Cairo in 1904, has come to replace the outworncreeds, the local codes; to help the peoples of the world to march on to a newera of peace and happiness.Its power has been made evident time after time. On three occasions itspublication has been followed by disaster—catastrophes to awaken mankind to itsmessage. For the fourth time the Law of Thelema has been published.…The prospectus following gives particulars of the book “The Equinox of the Gods”which contains in facsimile the manuscript of the “Book of the Law” of Thelema,and an account of how it came into existence.You cannot afford to neglect the powerful message which it propounds, and theguidance it gives for your future and the future of the world.Crowley was proud of this book as he believed its proper publication would causesuch social and political upheaval that the Law of Thelema would sweep theworld. On December 13 he presented an advance copy of the book to hisseven-month-old son.On December 21, he prepared to make a dream come true. The first time hepublished The Equinox of the Gods, he had a vision of adepts representing theearth’s different races presenting him with the Word of the Equinox. Crowleywanted to return the favor by presenting a representative for each race with hisown word.A representative for the white race was easy enough to find: Crowley choseYorke. That evening, the two of them dined and embarked on a pub-crawl andgin-soak, accompanied by Daily Express reporter Tom Driberg. On their bizarretrek, they added a black dancing girl, a Bengali Muslim, a Jew, and a Malayan totheir party along the way. The challenge, according to Yorke, was to keep theparty going until 6 o’clock the next morning; this, presumably, they did bycrashing a party at the Erskine. Crowley called it “a terribly dull party,brightening when we got rid of most of ’em and started whiskey.”At 6:22 a.m., Crowley and Yorke took the group of puzzled strangers toCleopatra’s Needle on the Embankment. There, as the sun entered Capricorn,Crowley made a brief speech: “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.I, Ankh-f-n-Khonsu, the Priest of the Princes, present you, as representativesof your race, with The Book of the Law. It is the charter of universal freedomfor every man and woman in the world. Love is the law, love under will.” Hepresented each of them with a copy of the book, officially marking itspublication. After the confused recipients staggered back to their homes,Crowley went to bed. “It was one of the craziest evenings I have ever spent,”Yorke remarked. The next morning, Crowley’s diary noted “Hangover very bad.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-ONETHE BOOK OF THOTH“An Englishman, a Jew, an Indian, a Negro, a Malayan—no, it’s not one of thosesaloon-bar jokes—assembled on the Embankment by Cleopatra’s Needle soon after 6a.m. yesterday.…” Thus Tom Driberg, using the pen name William Hickey, began hisDaily Express article on the bizarre republication of The Equinox of the Gods.It ran in the December 23 edition of the newspaper. Despite the free publicity,this reissue sold poorly. Crowley reports that only forty copies of the book gotout;1 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts001] after Crowley’s death,the unbound sheets sold in editions by Samuel Weiser and Thelema Publications.2[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts002]He was now aged sixty-two—“Old Crow,” as Gerald Yorke affectionately calledhim—and his asthma grew increasingly worse. More so than in his youth, Crowleyrealized the time limits to publishing his backlog of writing. Ditto for hisopportunities to have children and train pupils. Thus he began a frenziedschedule of publishing, procreation, and searching for a successor. Theseactivities would dominate the rest of his life.Crowley’s next project was a one-shilling edition of The Book of the Law. Earlyin February 1938 he checked proofs of the prospectus; a month later, proofs ofthe book itself. Many preorders came in, and on March 19 Crowley distributedadvance copies. It officially appeared on March 21, the vernal equinox of 1938.It was a small paperback with white wrappers, later reprinted in America withblue wrappers. Despite brisk sales, Crowley had an ample stock to circulateuntil his death.One copy, warmly inscribed with thanks for support and friendship in thepublication of his most important work, went to Cammell. The poet curiously readthis book until he reached the dreaded chapter three and could read no further.He confronted Crowley for printing such inexcusable blasphemy. Shaken andlamentful, Old Crow pleaded that he was simply the book’s stenographer, not itsauthor, and that he had acted on orders to publish the book in unaltered form.Cammell found Crowley’s excuses lame. Despite his love of books, he wascompelled to burn the volume—per the commentary’s instructions—and felt greatrelief when he did.3 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts003] In lateryears another recipient, Madame Wellington Koo, would write, “Instead ofdestroying your Book of the Law, I venture to return it to you in case you mightbe short of copies.”4 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts004]Back in February, Crowley had written of Frieda Harris, “She is seriously on thePath.”5 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts005] His May 3 diary added,“She is now quite definitely a pupil.” Within a week she affiliated to OTO for£106 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts006] and joined theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]with the motto TzBA (which in Hebrew meant “Host” and added up to ninety-three).Later that summer, she bought a copy of The Equinox I(8) from Crowley for £1. Itcontained Crowley’s description of the tarot cards, which prompted discussionson the subject. That August, Crowley suggested that Soror Tzaba design a deck.“I don’t know anything about tarot cards,” she pleaded. He assured her, “It willbe easy.” They’d start with an existing deck of cards and simply embellish thedesigns based on descriptions in The Equinox. He estimated six months’ work, andshe readily agreed.Looking back over forty years of study, Crowley found the descriptions in TheEquinox woefully inadequate. Frieda suggested he redesign the deck and write abook on the subject while she painted the cards to his specifications. ACaverred:You are under a complete misapprehension about this tarot business. My originalidea was simply to get hold of the best available old pack and have themre-drawn with occasional corrections and emendations. I expected to stick veryclosely to the Equinox description. As you will remember very well, I thoughtthe whole thing could have been finished easily by Christmas.… it is entirelydue to your genius that things are otherwise. It is you who have goaded me intogetting the heart out of the whole business and taking each card separately asan individual masterpiece. The result is that any given card is somethingimmensely beyond anything that I have ever contemplated.7[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts007]As a final carrot, Harris offered Crowley a stipend in exchange for lessons inmagick. This, she reasoned, would better enable her to execute the new cards.That August they began the task, originally projected for an optimistic sixmonths but which kept them both hard at work for five years. Crowley and Harriswere both perfectionists: He with a very specific vision of what he wanted eachcard to look like, and she determined to meet his high standards.8[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts008] In a lighthearted mood, Friedawrote AC, “All day yesterday I wore three pair of glasses and squinted at asmall map and at my design.… My eyes fell out and my hair went white and today Ican’t see at all and I’ve had to go to bed and am now writing with my eyes tiedup in hot tea.…”9 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts009] In a moreserious letter about card XX, “The Aeon,” however, she revealed that her humordid not greatly exaggerate the truth:My Guardian Angel shouts to do it the best you can and not second best in ahurry and you must hit a perfect structure to build the pictures on. Theelemental Cherubims are quite jolly but the Little Lady has twisted and turned’till I am insane with wiggling lines and I’ve done about forty drawings ofher.10 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts010]Aside from Frieda Harris, several others became involved in Thelema in 1938.California’s Agape Lodge admitted several new members that January, includingtwenty-year-old Phyllis Evelina Pratt (1917–2004), who would become involved notonly in OTO, but also inA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]as Soror Meral; she would eventually advance to IX° in OTO and remain a fixtureon the scene for the rest of her life, being one of those instrumental incarrying Crowley’s teachings on to a new generation.11[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts011] Joining with her was hersweetheart (and future husband), twenty-two-year-old Paul Seckler, who could goon to officiate at initiations, act in Regina Kahl’s production of “PetrifiedForest” for the Adult Evening College, and serve three years in San QuentinState Prison from 1940 to 1943 after he was convicted of grand theft auto.12[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts012] Luther L. Carroll, who tookover as Deacon in the Gnostic Mass, also acted in Kahl’s productions and becameanA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]Probationer on March 18, 1939.13[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts013] Finally, American discipleLouis Turley Culling (1894–1973), a member of both OTO andA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg],helped Crowley seek lawyers to denounce AMORC.14[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts014]Meanwhile, Crowley admitted Arthur Day to the grade of Minerval on August 24; hebecame a frequent visitor and promised to affiliate to the Vo for £17 15s. ACalso contacted psychologist and Co-Mason and Martinist Grunddal Sjallung(1895–1976), recognizing him as Frater Galahad, Grand Master X° of the DanishOTO; this was one of the rare occasions Crowley took interest in OTO in othercountries.15 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts015]Another new student was John Bland Jameson (born c. 1915) of the Theatre ArtsClub. From all accounts he was a dilettante, unemployed and living a wild lifeof dining, parties, and travel. Although he attended Cambridge’s drama school,stage fright blocked his graduation. He was interested in magick, having longcollected Crowley’s works, and wrote AC on May 11, 1938, to invite him to lunch.As a result, Jameson became his student. Furthermore, as the actor was awayduring July and August—playing in the Cornish Shakespearean Festival—he sublethis large flat on 6 Hasker Street to Crowley. After his return in August,Jameson became a Probationer with the agreement that, if Crowley was satisfiedwith his progress in a year, Jameson would become his successor.Around August 16, Jameson paid a £100 founders’ share in Crowley’s newestscheme: a clinic that, for a minimum fee of £50, would provide rejuvenationthrough massage, ultraviolet radiation, and OTO’s elixir of life. The clinic wasbut one of many tricks filling Crowley’s sleeves: If he could raise £2,000, hewould go to America and seize control of AMORC, guaranteeing an annual income of£80,000. He also sought producers for Mortadello and The Three Wishes, andpursued other magical plans aside from the tarot. “The orchard has many apples,”he told Jameson, “though one cannot tell which tree shall ripen first.”16[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts016]As the autumnal equinox approached, Crowley prepared to publish The Heart of theMaster. Written in 1924, it was originally published in the 1925 Germanperiodical Pansophia, which was not distributed much outside of the smallmembership of the Collegium Pansophicum.17[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts017] AC devoted September toreviewing its proofs and binding and on the 21st received eleven special copiesof the book. Two days later the OTO publication officially appeared in itsflashing colors of yellow and purple.September also marked nine months since publication of The Equinox of the Gods.As expected, the news from Europe looked worse and worse:September 11. Grave news on BBC. Will there be immediate war?September 21. WAR.September 26. Hitler’s speech. War seems certain.September 27. I.W.E. [Küntzel] raving against Czechs: these people are reallyinsane.Then, on September 29, the bottom fell through at the Munich Conference, andBritain and France yielded to Nazi demands. In disgust, Crowley jotted in redink on a copy of The Equinox of the Gods’s prospectus that publication occurred“Nine months before the Betrayal, which stripped Britain of the last rags ofhonour, prestige and security, and will break up civilization.”Crowley’s various romantic forays stabilized for a time with a runner namedPeggy Wetton. On October 7 and 8 they began a series of sex magick workings tobeget another son for Crowley. “She claims that this worked right away,” Crowleynoted in his diary,18 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts018] but atthe end of December, Crowley recorded her miscarriage. After a kitchen fireburned Peggy’s hand and sent her into the hospital, Crowley conducted sex magickworkings with someone named Josephine Blackley to heal her arm. Peggy Wettonfaded from the scene shortly thereafter.Crowley spent autumn of 1938 working on more books. He busily dictateddescriptions of the tarot cards, beginning with their traditional designs andbuilding on or revising them in accordance with forty years’ study of magick andmysticism. Frieda, meanwhile, continued the arduous task of painting the cards.Since she lived in the country and communicated with Crowley by mail, workproceeded slowly. Crowley was a hard task-master, supplying very specificdescriptions (and sometimes sketches) of the cards, rejecting even the slightestdeviation from his ideal. The artist on some occasions went through as many asseven revisions before an acceptable card was produced, much to her frustration.Fortunately her dedication and patience won out. She respected Crowley’slearning, and he admired her ability to interpret and render his descriptions inher own style.Meanwhile his secretary, Nora Knott, prepared typescripts of “Yoga forYellowbellies” and “Yoga for Yahoos.” He had long considered these primecandidates for publication, and now planned their release as Eight Lectures onYoga. On December 15 he began dictating a manuscript on the I Ching.Little Essays toward Truth, a collection of Crowley’s philosophical writings,became his next book to go to press. He took it and a £10 deposit to the printeron November 4. The prospectus was ready by the 18th, and Crowley was soon takingorders for the book. He designed the dust jacket on December 3, and two dayslater Soror Tzaba rendered it to his specifications. OTO published thefive-shilling book on December 22, 1938, at 12:13 p.m. as the sun entered thesign of Capricorn: precisely the winter solstice.At the end of 1938, Jameson dashed in to appoint Crowley power of attorney, thendashed out again for business in Switzerland. Various ailments laid AC out forthe first two months of 1939 despite frequent treatments for his asthma. WhenJameson returned from Switzerland on January 17 they began petty and openbickering. The conflict came to a head in mid-February when Crowley moved outand Jameson entered a nursing home for surgery.Spring of 1939 saw Old Crow as busy as ever. On the evening of Wednesday, March17 (two days after Germany occupied Czechoslovakia), he gave a talk anddemonstration titled “Travelling on the Astral Plane” at 32 Fairhazel Gardens.He also designed the cover for his yoga book and began correcting its pageproofs. By April 3, Crowley had a sample copy of Eight Lectures on Yoga, by theMahatma Guru Sri Paramahansa Shivaji. Of his pseudonym, Crowley wrote, “The nameis, of course, a little slap of mine at the swinish scoundrels who conferhigh-sounding titles on themselves, and write books about a subject which theydo not understand at all.”19 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts019]He was referring to His Holiness Mahatma Sri Agamya Guru Paramahamsa, with whomhe was associated at the dawn of his Equinox period in London. Eight Lectures onYoga was a large-sized book, constituting the next issue of The Equinox: Volume3, Number 4.20 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts020]That May, Crowley had another manuscript and prospectus ready for the printer:his interpretation of the Chinese classic King Khang King. It resulted in a slimedition, with Crowley inscribing each of the specially bound copies with adifferent drawing, rendering each one unique.In June, Crowley continued working on the tarot. When he found himself without asecretary, Lady Harris herself visited AC and took dictation so the Great Workcould proceed. She continued until mid-July, when he finished the forty numberedand sixteen court cards of the tarot’s minor arcana. That August, AC beganmaking headway on the twenty-two major arcana cards.In America, Agape Lodge continued to grow. New members included Brother Floyd E.Wade and Sister Margaret Arnold. The senior members busied themselves with theirnew property: Roy Leffingwell’s Rancho Royal, on fifty desert acres inCalifornia’s Rainbow Valley. Roy Edward Leffingwell (1886–1952) was aprofessional composer who, during the 1930s, had hosted morning radio shows onLos Angeles stations KECA, KPAC, KFI, and KIEV.21[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts021] Born November 30, 1886, inGrand Rapids, Michigan, he had worked in various cities before settling in theLos Angeles area in the early 1920s.22[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts022] He took his Minervalinitiation into OTO on February 24, 1938, became anA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]probationer on September 23, 1938,23[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts023] and would in Crowley’slifetime ultimately advance to the IX° in OTO. His wife, Reea, would join OTOsome eighteen months after him.Smith, Kahl, and the Leffingwells—Roy, Reea, and their son—took a two-daypilgrimage at the end of August to the property, which they renamed AgapeValley. Although Smith wanted to consecrate the land to the Great Work, the onlyritual he knew was the Gnostic Mass. So, with no paraphernalia, they improvised:a circle of small stones constituted the temple, and a large rock became thealtar. An old army overcoat that they found on the land became Smith’s robe; awreath of leaves became his crown, and a stick his lance. Leffingwell acted asDeacon, using a water glass for the chalice and a cracked dinner plate for thepaten. Kahl was Priestess. They lit some dry leaves for incense and did theritual, Smith adding his benediction, “Be this valley and the hills, the earththereof and the water, the air and the fire, consecrated to the Great Work andthe establishment of the Law of Thelema.”24[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts024] The ceremony was especiallypotent for the small group. As Leffingwell recalled,Wilfred so intense, so reverent, so impressed with the solemnity of the ritualthat it literally tore him apart. Regina couldn’t go through her love chant dueto emotional choke up. Wilfred, in an old army overcoat and some ridiculousleaves on his bald head, looking, acting, feeling every inch the Priest. Thefinest rendition of the Mass I ever saw.25[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts025]Life in Britain changed drastically as the Nazis continued their invasions andpersecutions. The British prepared for the worst by blacking out their windowsat night with screens and blankets to make houses difficult for bombers to spot.Tension ran high, and Crowley wrote Küntzel disparagingly about Germany:Over there you have no idea of what the world is thinking. As for the ravingsabout the Jews, they are simply unintelligible. Almost the whole of life inGermany above brutality, stupidity and cruelty, servility, and blood-thirst wasJewish. Germans are far below Jews, generally speaking, as monkeys below men;but I have always been fond of monkeys and don’t want to offend them bycomparing any German to one.26 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts026]Britain, he warned, would “knock Hitler for a six.” He never heard from heragain; Küntzel reportedly died of old age in Germany in December 1941.27[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts027]On August 31 women and children evacuated London; it would be nearly three weeksbefore he learned that Deirdre and Ataturk were safe in Yugoslavia. The dayafter the evacuation, September 1, Germany invaded Poland with the result thatBritain and France declared war. The next day, Crowley noted in his diary,“First air raid (perhaps). No noises here.”In a flurry of patriotism, Crowley composed a poem in honor of his homeland andsent it to the printer. The four-page card England, Stand Fast! appeared,courtesy of OTO, at 10:50 p.m. on September 23, the autumnal equinox. On October8, the day the Third Reich annexed western Poland, Crowley sent copies of hispoem to the BBC and others to whip up patriotism.Three days after the declaration of war, AC contacted England’s NavalIntelligence Division (NID) offering to serve his war-torn homeland:Sir,I have the honour to apply for employment. At the end of 1914, being incapableof active service owing to phlebitis, I went to New York, where I saw Captain(later Commodore) Gaunt, R.N., to whom I reported directly or indirectly untilthe Armistice. My work was to get in touch with the most important leaders ofGerman opinion in the United States, especially George Sylvester Viereck,Professor Hugo Münsterberg, and Graf von Vernstorff, to supply them with falseinformation and to wreck their propaganda by inducing them to commitpsychological blunders: all with the object of inducing the United States toenter the war on our side. As soon as they did so, I was able to report directlyfor their Department of Justice, principally in discovering spy activities.In 1927, I began work for the Special Branch, this time to watch and report onCommunist activities, especially in Berlin, where I lived almost continuouslyfor three years.With regard to my qualifications, I speak several languages, though none of themvery well except French. But I have spent many years in the study of psychology,especially morbid psychology. In particular, I have a sympathetic understandingof Americans, so that they do not feel for me that distrust and aversion whichis the lot of so many English. My reputation as a writer in America is veryconsiderable, and I have maintained for the last 25 years close connection withseveral of the most important leaders of thought in that country.I have also great sympathetic understanding of Eastern modes of thought, whetherof the Mohammedean, Hindu or Chinese type; it was in fact at one time proposedthat I should be detailed to counteract the influence of Gandhi over hisco-religionists; but this came to nothing, as the situation was cleared upotherwise.Your obedient servant,Aleister Crowley28 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts028]The mention of Gandhi is most interesting, as reference to this proposedactivity turns up nowhere else. Two days later, Crowley completed an NIDapplication. When they declined to hire him, Crowley attributed it to hisadvanced age of sixty-four.29 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts029]Nevertheless, AC passed several bits of information to the NID, which gratefullythanked him. He claimed to have met with the NID and suggested a magical gesturethat opposed the Nazi swastika: V for Victory (more on this will follow). Healso suggested air-dropping magical English propaganda to demoralize theGermans.Over the years he had met several agents of Britain’s counterintelligence. GuyKnowles, who’d accompanied him on the K2 expedition, was an MI6 agent. TomDriberg, who was also an agent, had introduced Crowley to two others: horrorwriter Dennis Wheatley (1897–1977),30[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts030] to whom Crowley inscribed acopy of Mortadello in May 1934 and who would join MI5 in 1943; and his wife,Joan, whom Crowley remembered from Foyle luncheons as wearing silly hats. DennisWheatley was close friends with Maxwell Knight, who met Crowley at theWheatley’s and described him as “a well-dressed, middle-aged eccentric with themanner of an Oxford don.”James Bond creator Ian Fleming (1908–1964) was also an MI5 agent acquainted withCrowley—probably through Knight, who was the model of the Bond character M.Fleming tried unsuccessfully to convince his superiors to use the Enochianalphabet as a code for planting bogus information. And when England planned tocapture Hitler’s deputy, Rudolf Hess (1894–1987), by setting him up with a bogusBritish astrologer, Fleming and Knight both cast Crowley in the role;unfortunately, AC was too familiar to the Germans, so they used an unknown.After Hess was captured, Fleming urged his superiors to let Crowley interviewhim, convinced that the Nazis based their activities on occult knowledge thatonly a master would know how to extract. Unfortunately, Fleming’s superiorsnixed the plan.Another agent of Crowley’s acquaintance was Second Viscount and Fourth BaronTredegar, Lord Evan Frederick Morgan (1893–1949), an eccentric Welsh dilettante:a poet, painter, musician, occultist, and collector of objects d’art.31[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts031] As part of MI8, the RadioSecurity Service,32 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts032] he andWing-Commander (later Right Honourable Sir) George Stanley Waller (b. 1911)launched a disastrous response to Nazi spy pigeons. Their plan—for the Royal AirForce to drop hundreds of pigeons along the south coast of England to confusethe enemy—bombed when the jets’ slipstreams sucked up the birds and defeatheredthem. Tredegar was ultimately arrested and imprisoned in the Tower of London fortreason because he took his date to his office and divulged details of his work;ultimately MI5 intervened to arrange his release.Tredegar’s arrest typified MI5 security. All agents took oaths of secrecy andwere expected to describe their jobs as “work in a rather dull department in thewar office.” Even today MI5 is secretive of its World War II activities. Thus,although he assisted MI5 agents, little is known about the exact servicesCrowley provided the government.On December 7, Crowley returned to his literary pursuits and prepared anothermanuscript. On the 11th, he sent Temperance: A Tract for the Times, a collectionof five poems, to Apex Printing Service. One hundred copies of the book wereofficially released on December 22 at 6:06 p.m., with copies sold, as with hisother recent titles, through BCM/ANKH.New hardships marked the beginning of 1940. On January 8, England beganrationing bacon, butter, and sugar. Deirdre, meanwhile, was still in Yugoslavia,seriously ill with septicemia, while Ataturk recovered from the flu; after theirrecovery they would leave Europe altogether and seek solace with Pat’sgrandmother in Jerusalem. When Germany invaded the Netherlands, Belgium,Luxembourg, and France in May, Germer wrote to Crowley that he expectedimmediate arrest. This is, in fact, what happened: he was apprehended inBelgium, where he was reputedly trying to revive magick, and sent to a Frenchconcentration camp.Crowley himself hardly fared better. Late that spring, AC began sufferingdebilitating attacks of asthma that kept him up at night and forced him tocancel and postpone work. His usual medications were no longer helping torelieve the symptoms. As his diaries record:Wednesday June 12. Really bad attack of asthma.Friday June 14. Inflamed throat still bad. Asthma much worse.Saturday June 15. Throat—shade better. Asthma very bad indeed.Sunday June 16. Throat better: asthma very much worse. Almost continuous.Monday June 17. Throat still improves: asthma still bad.Wednesday June 19. Asthma all day.Thursday June 20. Asthma still v bad.And so it continued until July 19, when his doctor, C. H. Cranshaw, prescribedheroin. The dosage, between a sixth and a quarter of a gram (a standard medicaldosage), was Crowley’s first since he kicked the habit in the mid-1920s. Hence,he recorded in his diary, “I’m quite dopy!” It is worth noting that, contrary topopular belief that Crowley was a lifelong addict, his first use of heroin wasin 1919 at age forty-four. At that time, the drug was legal and his physicianhad prescribed it for asthma. An addiction naturally developed, but Crowleytried repeatedly—and ultimately successfully—to cure himself. His 1925 diary isthe last time he mentions heroin; and P. R. Stephensen attested that, between1929 and 1930, Crowley took no drugs at all.33[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts033] Now, at age sixty-four, hereceived another heroin prescription for his asthma. It was twenty years sincehis first prescription and was again for purely medical reasons.Beginning with this 1940 reintroduction to the drug, Crowley took his first steptoward renewed heroin dependency. Given his age and the state of his health, itwas simpler for Crowley to register himself with the government and medicatehimself as his asthma warranted. On July 23, 1940, his diary expressed hiscaution: “Another very bad night. Used 2 tablets heroin: but oh! such lots ofAsthmosana.”34 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts034]The Battle of Britain began in July, with ninety German bombers shot down overEngland. Although outnumbered and overpowered, the British air force scored amajor victory in this air battle. Germany responded with the Blitz. Air-raid andall-clear sirens filled Crowley’s days that August, and explosions vigorouslyshook his home in Richmond. Initially infrequent, the raids soon escalated tomultiple daily occurrences. Crowley first tried to intellectualize the raidsrather than feel threatened, writing to Montgomery Evans:The raids last summer were exciting, not alarming. There was nothing one coulddo about it, so I slept quietly through everything. But they were sointeresting—guessing what any particular noise might mean and (sometimes)spectacular that they made it difficult to concentrate on Work, and I just hadto finish the tarot book.35 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts035]After a full day of air raids on September 18, however, Crowley wrote in hisdiary, “11:35. Great air fuss, but not much fun! Too near here.” Five minuteslater, an explosion went off nearby, its echoes resounding for a full minute. Atthis time, Crowley wrote Evans, “Had a certain bomb fallen 20 yards furtherwest, I should have not got your letter of Sept. 25, but London would have beena more wholesome place.…”36 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts036]The strain of worsening asthma and bombings wracked Crowley’s body. One night,AC’s landlord phoned Cammell, stammering, “Mr. Crowley is very ill, and I’mworried. With his breathing the way it is, I don’t think his heart will hold outthrough the night. He’s asking for you; could you come?” What Cammell foundshocked him: illness had withered Crowley’s stout and portly frame into to awiry skeleton; that night, sleeplessly straining for air, he looked jaundicedand mummified. His eyes were like embers, bloodshot from hours of congestion.And when occasional words of gratitude or humor wheezed from his weary lungs,Cammell cringed. Meanwhile, a stream of German bombers flew overhead. AlthoughEngland had only a few antiaircraft guns, a huge one at the nearby railway firedcontinuously. As explosions shook Crowley’s home, Cammell pondered how simplydeath could snatch these two old men.A brilliant explosion filled the sky with a light visible even through theblackout curtains. A screeching sound followed, and Cammell, his vigilinterrupted, knew a bomber had been hit. Dashing down the rickety stairs and outthe front door, he watched its flaming wreckage strike the Twickenham bank,until the cheer “Hooray!” startled him. Cammell turned to see that Old Crow haddashed down the stairs two at a time behind him. The Crowley who hovered on thebrink of death now hopped about, waving his arms in the air. The friends watchedday break over the wreck’s yellow and mauve flames, then went inside and drank atoast.37 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts037]His doctor put it simply: get out of London or die of heart failure. With the IChing’s advice, Crowley decided to stay in Torquay until the stressful bombingsstopped. Setting out on the fall equinox, he arrived September 25. Crowleycalled the town “my ancestral temple,”38[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts038] for it was here, fifty yearsago, that his tutor Archibald Douglas taught him the facts of life, and herethat Alec discovered the awful mysteries of love and sex in the open countryair. “Torquay is anything but gray and shapeless,” he enthused upon arrival. “Itis astonishingly beautiful. Flowers bloom afresh daily in my garden, and thewoods, the hills, the harbour and the sea are just a constant benediction. Thismorning, one of the loveliest dawns I have seen anywhere in the world.”39[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts039] Ironically, Crowley’s nursehere was a Plymouth sister.Yorke sent Crowley a secretary named Mrs. Martin so he could continue his work,and by October 23 he finished his descriptions of the twenty-two major tarotcards. “Polished off the last bit of the blasted tarot book and took it to betyped,” he wrote in his diary. “Later, discovered that I still have to do theother fifty-six cards. SHIT.” It would be a year and a half before Crowley wasfinished, writing to Yorke:Anyway, nearly killing myself in the process I finished the Court and smallcards. They needed what was practically rewriting in parts, as I have foundidentities between certain cards and (a) the Yi (b) the Geomantic figures. Thisis exceedingly important from the point of view of official science, as itdemonstrates beyond doubt that these independent systems reach the sameconclusions, and therefore that they all represent a reality in Nature, not anarbitrary set of artificial conventions. I assure you that one day this will bethe corner-stone of the scientific acceptance of the fact of Magick.40[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts040]While science and magick are no nearer an intersection today than they werethen, Crowley rightly assesses the importance of his work. Just as Magick inTheory and Practice was the first modern textbook on magick—standing today asthe definitive text of its kind—so would the Book of Thoth (as it would benamed, after the Egyptian god of magic) be a quantum leap in the tarot’sconceptualization. It would be the crystallization of everything Crowley hadlearned over the course of an entire lifetime’s study and practice of magick.For the moment, however, Crowley became sick for three months with acute lobarpneumonia. His asthma machine, which gave him little relief nowadays, brokedown, and he received an injection of atropine to dry up his bronchialsecretions. Then, on December 14, he swallowed a tooth; this was the beginningof dental problems for him.As he recovered, Crowley resurrected his interest in chess. He had recentlyattended London’s chess club, facing seasoned players like M. A. Sutherland;41[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts041] but in Torquay’s chess clubshe easily beat all comers. One incident epitomized for Crowley the club’smentality: they had been discussing Lord Haw-Haw, the Anglo-American whobroadcast anti-British propaganda from within Germany (and who would be triedand executed for treason after the war) when one person responded, “Isn’t thatthe fellow in the Tower?” Crowley wrote in his diary,42[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts042] “When I told the ignorantbastards that he was William Joyce, one said ‘Isn’t that the fellow that wrotethe dirty book?’ ”43 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts043]Ironically, within the year, AC would find himself the subject of one ofHaw-Haw’s attacks.Miscellaneous difficulties haunted Crowley for the first couple of months of1941. Lawyers contacted him demanding past rent; a difficult new secretary,Sophia Burt, appeared on the scene. Tooth decay threatened to turn into anabscess and improved only temporarily with tincture of iodine. Insomnia forcedhim to take Luminal, and the police fined him for turning on his lights onsleepless nights during the blackout.Around this time, Crowley contributed his expertise in magick to the war effort.If the Nazis could wield crushing power through the ancient symbol of theswastika, then England could certainly use more powerful magick to win the war.Hence a magical antidote to the swastika became his quest. Crowley’s firstsuggestion was the poem “Thumbs Up!” The corresponding gesture, popular amongpilots, was phallic, and Crowley wished to publish the poem with an equallyphallic pantacle on the cover. However, he desired a more potent symbol. “Howcan I put it over pictorially or graphically?” he pondered. “I want positiveritual affirmation, like Liber Resh, ‘saying will,’ and so on.”44[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts044]Soon afterward, he found this even more potent formula “to bring victory … [and]a way to put it across.”45 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts045]Crowley decided on the letter V: in Hebrew, vav is phallic in both image andmeaning; it literally meant “nail,” and Crowley thought this symbolized thenails in Hitler’s coffin. Furthermore, V suggested AC’s Magister Templi motto,V.V.V.V.V. And, according to the GD formula of LVX, V also designated theEgyptian deities of Apophis and Typhon; these deities suggested the tarot card“The Devil,” appropriate since the V also symbolizes a pair of horns. The V forApophis sign occurred in the Adeptus Minor (5°=6°) ritual, which is appropriatesince V is the number five in the Roman numeral system but six in gematria. Italso suggested the famous “Veni, vidi, vici” (“I came, I saw, I conquered”). Butmost importantly, Crowley recognized “V for Victory.” “Seabrook should bethrilled,” he wrote, “in view of his story about ‘Wow!’ ”46[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts046]Although “V for Victory” has been attributed to BBC broadcasts by Victor deLavaleye or David Ritchie, Crowley maintained he invented the gesture as amagical counterattack to the Nazi swastika; then, using his MI5 connections, hesuggested it to NID and had it accepted by Churchill. As he wrote to Yorke,The V sign. My object is to disclaim connection with my B.B.C. friend. The platein Eqx I 3 and to face p 374 of Magick is entitled “The Signs of the Grades,”caption to photographs “The L.V.X. signs.” Each photo is marked L - Isismourning, the Swastika. V - Apophis, the Trident. X -Osiris risen - thePentagram. Dates at least from the ’80sG[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]D[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg],but I have “Squatter’s Right” as first to publish it.47[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts047]Since Crowley demonstrates his primacy in publishing the V-sign, the second partof his claim—his intelligence connections—are of interest. He was on casual andfriendly terms with high-ranking naval officers, and the Director of NavalIntelligence had personally requested Crowley to apply to him. Shortly afterdeveloping this scheme, AC began meeting with Major Penny of the Air Ministry,presumably about putting it over. In various letters at this time he refers toanonymously “sneaking” his idea past the BBC.48[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts048]On March 14, Crowley cast a general hexagram for the day as he usually did. “TaYu,” the fourteenth hexagram, was his oracle. It denoted “great happenings.”When his mail arrived, Crowley sorted through the day’s parcels and came uponone that made him stop cold. The handwriting was distinctly familiar. Thecorners of his face curled up into a tremendous smile. Karl had written. “GreatHappenings/Havings indeed,” he wrote in his diary. “A letter from Germer, who issafe after all. The happiest evening of my life! Even the birth of littleAtaturk is not in the same class, for that I expected. This is astirring/stunning joy!” Germer had been liberated from a French concentrationcamp on February 18 when Cora obtained a nonquota visa for him through thePresident’s Committee for Refugees. Germer sailed for America on March 31, andapplied for his U.S. citizenship papers the following month.Although he escaped physically unscathed, Germer carried the psychological scarsof persecution in the form of paranoia. “Since 1942,” he wrote, “every one of mytelephones is tapped. The house in which we lived in New York was wired.Microphones had been installed in the walls. We left NY. But in this house it isthe same.”49 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts049] His suspicionsbecame so intense that the Germers never spoke in their own home.Crowley was nevertheless overjoyed that his dear friend was alive. On May 5 heappointed Germer Grand Secretary General of OTO, and on July 19 appointed him asCrowley’s representative in the United States. Germer was also Crowley’s chosensuccessor.A new magical current was sweeping into AC’s life. Ideas formed in his mind, andthe I Ching encouraged him to pursue them; so on March 16 he announced to LouisWilkinson, “I’m starting an Abbey of Thelema.”50[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts050] After twenty years, Crowley’sdesire for a Thelemic community endured. The next day he looked ataccommodations in Barton Brow, just outside Torquay and thirty miles fromPlymouth; on the 18th, he rented a house as his new Abbey.Once settled in, Crowley resumed work on his war poetry, completing “ThumbsUp!,” his national anthem of free England, on April 9. He kept long hours, onetime working twenty hours in one day and giving himself an asthma attack. Hebegan taking digitalis for his overworked heart.The Abbey maintained but a vague existence, with Crowley and Grace M. Horner(whom Crowley dubbed Charis, Greek for “grace”) signing the followingproclamation on April 20:We, the undersigned members of the Abbey of Thelema at Barton Brow Barton Cross,declare ourselves completely satisfied with the conduct & conditions thereofduring the passage of the Sun through Aries.51[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts051]Despite his satisfaction, Crowley wanted more. He wrote to Wilkinson, “The Abbeyis a bit stagnant: I do wish you would find a couple of suitable people, or asingle man, to join.”52 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts052]In the same letter, written two days after air raids destroyed Britain’s Houseof Commons, Crowley described the wartime conditions at Barton Brow:Raids over here almost every night; this house is constantly shaken.… They wentfor it last night, there was also a dogfight, complete with crash, right overthese moors. There is more accident than most people suppose. Twice, close tome, people have been killed by bombs jettisoned in despair from limping ’planes.In the end, however, lack of finances doomed the Abbey.A new current of growth also infused the Agape Lodge in California, with newmembers including rocket scientist Jack Parsons and, most recently, collegestudent Grady McMurtry.John Whiteside Parsons (1914–1952) was born with the forename Marvel but knownas “Jack” to his friends. Standing six-foot-two, he was an eccentric andhandsome young scientist developing explosives at the California Institute ofTechnology under a government contract. Born in Los Angeles to a wealthy andwell-connected family, Parsons had grown up in a Pasadena mansion and wascaptivated from an early age by images of rockets in science fiction pulpmagazines like Amazing Stories. He began launching homemade rockets from hisback yard in the 1920s and later worked for the Hercules Powder Company,manufacturers of various explosives. By the 1930s he was part of a rag-tag groupof people performing rocketry experiments at Caltech. Parsons—together with hiscolleagues, who were disparagingly nicknamed the “Suicide Squad”—effectivelyestablished rocketry as a science, founded the Jet Propulsion Laboratory(JPL),53 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts053] developed solidrocket fuels, and invented jet-assisted takeoff (JATO). Parsons also had along-standing interest in the occult. He attended events at Agape Lodge as earlyas 1939, and with his wife, Helen (1910–2003),54[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts054] was initiated on February 15,1941. Taking the motto “Thelema Obtentum Procedero Amoris Nuptiae,” his devotionto the Great Work made W. T. Smith remark to Crowley, “I think I have at longlast a really excellent man.”55[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts055]Grady Louis McMurtry (1918–1985) met Parsons at a meeting of the Los AngelesScience Fantasy Society,56 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts056]where Parsons struck up a conversation with him on science fiction, poetry, andmagick. McMurtry was initiated into Agape Lodge shortly thereafter on June 13,1941. Born in Big Cabin, Oklahoma, to an alcoholic mother and a father who wasrepeatedly imprisoned for bank robbery, McMurtry was raised by his maternalgrandfather and other relatives, relocating frequently throughout childhood tovarious parts of Oklahoma and the Midwest. He attended Valley Center High Schoolin Kansas, graduating in 1937. He enrolled in the ROTC and began studyingengineering at Pasadena Junior College. Months before joining Agape Lodge, hehad quit school without taking a degree. Although he lacked a plan for what todo next, he shared Parsons’s enthusiasm for poetry and Thelema.57[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts057]With the Lodge now burgeoning, the members planned fund-raising to bring Crowleyto America, where he could live out his last years in southern California’scomfortable climate, surrounded by students and supporters. On May 6, Smith wentto the U.S. Department of Immigration and Naturalization to sponsor Crowley’svisit.Amidst frequent air raids, Lady Harris planned an exhibition of the tarotpaintings at the Nicholson and Venn galleries in Oxford. That May, inspectingher budget and proposed show catalog, Crowley objected vehemently:I never saw such horror. No title, no lay-out, no word of what the show wasabout. Utterly obscure, full of bad grammar & misspelling, ill-typed,single-spaced, full of italics a full meal for 6 hungry printers! Pages & pages(20 typescript—over 6,000 words!!) of complete obfuscation. No hint of whatterms like Tetragrammaton, Sephiroth & their kind may mean. She had also sentThe Juggler—the one trump that must be done again, & in any case very unsuitableindeed for wrapper—to be reproduced very expensively so that printing & papermust be cheap!!! I have no memory of so black a rage as has consumed me for thelast 5 hours. All this though I had long ago prepared a proper catalogue,approved by Louis Wilkinson & other sensible people who understand such things;clear, modest, cheap to produce.58[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts058]Frieda responded with a letter asking Crowley to avoid Oxford during theexhibition, lest his reputation prejudice and frighten off potential supporters,and allow her to pass off the cards as her own work:The opposition against you in Oxford is very strong. My business is to get moneyto publish those cards if possible and this is nearly impossible in the presentwar conditions. I have been successful through using what influence I possess ingetting at people with money to come and see the Exhibition. This is using mysocial position fully. If they suspected that the cards were inspired by theArch Magician of Black Magic (what do they mean?) they would withdraw theirpatronage. I have had this conveyed to me politely and impolitely. Therefore ifyou come to the Private View or show up in any prominence this attempt to launchthe cards is doomed and all the work and money lost. Can you be so large-mindedand detached as to keep away until the thing is launched?59[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts059]Oxford was, after all, the campus that banned his Gilles de Rais lecture adecade earlier. The day of the exhibition, Crowley telegrammed a wry answer:HEARTIEST ACQUIESCENCE APPROVAL THERION.It was just as well, because a quick series of moves—seven in two weeks—hadupset his life. As an undischarged bankrupt and the “Wickedest Man in theWorld,” Crowley had difficulty locating a landlord. He remained philosophicalabout it all, anticipating his move to California. He simply put his things intostorage. “Burnt my boats magically,” he wrote in his diary, “by deciding todiscard anything not wanted for Rainbow Valley in the Palomar Mountains.”60[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts060]By June 7, in the middle of the tarot exhibition, he grew agitated. He hadreceived no word from Frieda whether the show was a success or failure, andfinally wired her two days later. While awaiting her reply, he happened byMichael Houghton’s Atlantis Bookshop. There in the window was a postcard fromFrieda Harris noting that the show was “Cancelled owing to war.” The postmark,Crowley noted indignantly, was June 3. Yet she never informed him. Crowley wentto Oxford himself to get to the bottom of this, but found nothing more than “ascared and hostile youth in dull desolation” who “refused all information.”61[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts061] Returning empty-handed,Crowley found Frieda’s reply telegram awaiting him. It offered little by way ofinformation, but a June 16 visit from her clarified everything: when Crowley’sinvolvement in the tarot project became known, Nicholson and Venn canceled theshow with no warning. Harris quickly rented the largest room at the RandolphHotel down the street, exhibiting the cards there and attracting “so many peoplethat I had to leave the gallery open at night in Oxford to allow theundergraduates to look at them.”62[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts062]That June, Crowley went to Whiteley’s, his storage company, and instructed themto sell all his possessions except for his books and papers. “Why?” heexplained, “Because I must either die or get to California.… In neither caseshall I need furniture and other perishable goods.”63[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts063] Shortly thereafter, in newaccommodations at 14 Lassall Gardens, he prepared his next book—the anti-Nazipentagram—for the printer. On June 22, the fateful day Germany invaded Russia,he officially named it Thumbs Up! The next day, he took it to Apex Printing forpublication.When the proofs of Thumbs Up! arrived on July 1, Crowley was busy seeking a newhome and courting the press with “England, Stand Fast!” “I think the poem byAleister Crowley is vigorous and certainly patriotic,” wrote Beverly Baxter ofAllied Newspapers Ltd. “At the same time, there is very little space innewspapers, and there is practically no chance of a poem being printed.”64[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts064] It was the same all around.Driberg, whom AC considered a shoo-in with the Daily Express, replied, “But howdo I know if the government wants England to stand fast?” And H. L. Mencken toldCrowley, “I daren’t show it to an American editor. He’d die of laughing.”65[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts065] Nevertheless, Crowley alsowrote of Thumbs Up! at this time, “So far, good and enthusiastic response; e.g.,C. E. M. Joad, John Cooper Powys, Louis Wilkinson, Harold Mortlake, and othermore or less prominent people. Navy quite thrilled!” and later “Thumbs Up! hasextracted praise and thanksgiving from U.S. Embassy, Naval blokes, Joad, JohnCooper Powys, Ralph Straus and so on. Joad specially nice about it. I’mencouraged.”66 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts066] Thus AC took onother projects: having Sun Engraving make blocks of Frieda’s tarot cards;looking for a composer to render his songs into French; and meeting with theU.S. consul about obtaining a passport for his pilgrimage to California.On July 28, Crowley received an irate letter from Cammell. A month earlier hiswife, Ionia, had sent samples of her handmade tweeds to AC, who promptly soldthem to his various acquaintances and kept the money. Ionia sought remuneration,and although Crowley laughed it off at first, the matter became a bone ofcontention that tore a rift in their friendship. Although Cammell continued toadmire Crowley’s talent as a poet, his unfriendly behavior mystified him.Standing by his wife, Cammell decided honor prohibited their friendship. Theywould never speak again.The notorious fascist and Nazi propaganda broadcaster William Joyce(1906–1946),67 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts067] known as LordHaw-Haw, attacked Crowley during one of his broadcasts, chiding that Englandought to replace its prayer intercessions with Crowley conducting a Black Massat Westminster Abbey. AC, who felt his character had been tarnished enough,worried that the attack would undermine his V-Sign campaign. “Thanks to LordHaw-Haw, it is now quite generally known that I invented this campaign,” Crowleybemoaned. “Of course, I am denying strenuously that I ever had anything to doabout it, as the bloke who slipped it over on the idiots at the BBC would getinto the most hellish trouble if it were found out that he knows me.”68[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts068]On August 17, Crowley sent his newly revised Thumbs Up! manuscript to ChiswickPress. He had asked Frieda to draw the cover, but notes in his diary: “FHwouldn’t draw any V cover, sent me a nice tie instead.”69[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts069] She ultimately relented andprovided the artwork of Crowley’s “Mark of the Beast” magical sigil. AlthoughChiswick Press turned out an advance copy of Thumbs Up! within three days, italso demanded advance payment before delivering the completed job. Crowleyfumed, “I told them they could sell the edition for waste paper and I would getanother printer.”70 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts070] Theyallowed him to pick up the finished product a day later.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_082_r1.jpg]Crowley’s “Mark of the Beast” from Thumbs Up! (photo credit 21.1)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c21-fig001a]Even as the book appeared, he was designing its reprint. As Yorke suggested, hedropped the magical “mumbo-jumbo” and his name; its eight pages would have nocover, its title page simply reading “Thumbs Up! Five poems by the author of theV-Sign for free distribution among the soldiers and workers of the soldiers offreedom.”71 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts071] This edition wouldarrive on September 19.Response to the book was apparently positive, for Crowley wrote ebulliently toYorke, “Navy quite thrilled. If I can get really big success, it will put me ina position to ask for an interview with Winston to put up to him the 2nd half ofmy V plan. This might be the war engine in AL iii.7–8.”72[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts072] The interview never came topass, leaving us to ponder what Crowley had in mind.At the end of August, AC and Yorke took a brief foray into the past to thepoet’s forty-year-old haunts at Cambridge. Visiting Trinity Chapel—something henever did as a student—he exorcized one of his ghosts by mounting the high altarand proclaiming, “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.” The visitwas wonderful and Yorke’s company delightful.Reminiscing concluded, Crowley returned to work. When his lover, Alice Upham,suggested he send a copy of Thumbs Up! to Charles de Gaulle, AC, although heliked the idea, remarked, “OK, but I had better write a poem in French for FreeFrance.”73 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts073] This he wrote thefollowing day.Crowley turned sixty-six that October. Since sixty-six was the sum of thenumbers from one to eleven, and eleven was such a significant number in hismagick, he wanted something more special than the presents and letters hereceived from Pearl, Frieda, Alice, Karl. and former student J. G. Bayley. So,taking The Book of the Law in hand, he rededicated his life to the Great Work.Sliding the book back onto the shelf, Frieda’s rejected tarot card for the Aeonslipped down from the shelf overhead. Picturing the Stele of Revealing, the cardsymbolized the beginning of the Aeon of Horus and was as good an omen as Crowleyhad ever seen.Shortly thereafter, he decided that the war-torn world needed a concisestatement of the Law of Thelema: an epigrammatic explanation of “Do what thouwilt shall be the whole of the Law”; a proclamation of the basic rights of everyhuman being as given in The Book of the Law. Declaring that the enemy wasdepriving people of their basic rights, AC gave this project the working titleof “War Aims.”“Oh for a title for my War Aims!” he lamented. “Can’t use ‘Rights of Man.’ Iwant to keep monosyllabic … ‘Words of the Way of the Will’?” He brainstormed onpossible terms: “Watch-Words Law Plan Sketch Step Strict Path Clue Key RuleGuard Bawe Curve Straight Line Snake.” Finally on November 6 he came up with thename: Oz. The word was Hebrew for goat—an animal renowned for its independenceand perseverence—and added up to seventy-seven (denoting strength and theinfluence of Kether, the highest emanation on the Tree of Life). Thus the WarAims became Liber Oz, and its summary of human rights required 220 words (220being the number of verses in The Book of the Law). Ultimately, he drew on thelanguage of one of the OTO rituals he had revised in 1918–1919:OZ: LIBER LXXVII“the law of the strong:this is our lawand the joy of the world.”—AL. II.21“Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.” —AL. I. 40.“thou hast no right but to do thy will.Do that, and no other shall say nay.” —AL. I. 42–3.“Every man and every woman is a star.” —AL. I. 3THERE IS NO GOD BUT MAN1. Man has the right to live by his own law. to live in the way that he wills todo: to work as he will: to play as he will: to rest as he will: to die when andhow he will.2. Man has the right to eat what he will: to drink what he will: to dwell wherehe will: to move as he will on the face of the earth.3. Man has the right to think what he will: to speak what he will: to write whathe will: to draw, paint, carve, etch, mould, build as he will: to dress as hewill.4. Man has the right to love as he will: — “take your fill and will of love asye will, when, where, and with whom ye will.” —AL. I. 51.5. Man has the right to kill those who would thwart these rights.“the slaves shall serve.” —AL. II. 58.“Love is the law, love under will.” —AL. I. 57.That evening he made up a dummy for a postcard bearing this message. His printerestimated two hundred copies at £3 3s.This project troubled his friends. Frieda Harris and Ethel Archer both sentletters discouraging Crowley from publishing the statement; despite theinsistence of patriots on defending to the death people’s rights, point five ofLiber Oz gave them pause. He nevertheless determined to see the project throughbecause it was more than just a postcard: it was a powerful magical act. OnlyBayley, anA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]student from thirty years ago and now returned to the fold, offered to help paythe costs. Appropriately, the proofs were completed on Crowley’s magicalbirthday: the anniversary of his initiation into the GD. In the end, fiftycopies bore Frieda’s artwork for “The Devil” (the fifteenth tarot trump) on oneside and the proclamation on the other, while 250 had “The Aeon” (the twentiethtrump). To magically affirm the publication, AC sent cards to everyone he couldthink of, including figureheads of various walks of life: H. G. Wells forliterature; journalist Lord Edward Donegall (1903–1975), the Sixth Marquis ofChichester, for the press; Ivor Back for medicine; Gerald Kelly for art; J. F.C. Fuller for the army; Admiral Sir Roger John Brownlow Keyes (1872–1945),Conservative member of Parliament, for the navy; F. W. Hylton for agriculture;and Frederic Maugham (1866–1958), Lord Chancellor and First Viscount Maugham,for law. To Louis Wilkinson he wrote, “I think this publication may turn out tobe a Magical Gesture; you may therefore look out for a Revolution (in one formor another) at the Autumnal Equinox.”74[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts074]Five days later, the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor and the United States declaredwar on Japan.As 1941 came to a close, winter came in cold and snowy. Crowley succumbed toillness and depression for the remainder of the season. On top of apleurisy-inflamed chest, worsening asthma, and a fibrillating heart, he was nowtaking heroin regularly, as prescribed by his physician, Cranshaw. As the winterwore on and the Sunday Dispatch ran a premature obituary on Crowley, heremarked, “I want a vast empty heaven to laugh into for several eternities.”75[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts075] Nevertheless, he wrote hiswill and sent Germer a letter naming him his legatee and successor as OHO.In January of 1942 a creative spasm inspired Crowley to write about “ ‘ourinbred fucked-out families’ who are strangling us,”76[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts076] resulting in the humorouspolitical poem “Landed Gentry.” He celebrated the January 30 completion of hisfirst draft with a recital for his friends, who responded with laughter andcheers. As an encore, Crowley read an old favorite, “The City of God.” When hefinished, he smiled sentimentally and wept. After all these years the poem hadlost none of its power.On February 12 he found two more rhymes for “acity,” added them to “LandedGentry,” and officially completed it. The next month, he met Mr. Green of theChiswick Press to print it in waistcoat pocket–size format. Green, fearingtrouble from the censor, would not take the job; nor would any other printer.Green did, however, estimate the tarot book, set in twelve-point type, quartoformat, at £239 for one hundred copies or £281 for two hundred. That much moneywas unavailable, and Crowley knew he would have to set the book up in stagesonce funds became available.With the tarot book slowly working its way to press, Crowley forged ahead withanother book of poetry: his “greatest hits” with additional new material. He wasdecidedly cagey about the title, Olla. While it was Latin for “vase,” he toldEthel Archer, “The meaning of Olla is, roughly, ‘stew,’ a Spanish dish.”77[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts077] Yet to Wilkinson, heattributed the name to Catullus’s “particularly foul” epigram: Ipsa olera ollalegit (“the pot gathers its own herbs”).78[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts078] In this instance, “Olla”referred to the vagina. Knowing Crowley, this last meaning is likely the correctone. Regardless, much of his energy went into composing new poems.As spring warmed things up, Crowley’s spirits lightened accordingly. He awokeEaster Sunday, stretched, and said, “Hail Eastre—goddess of Spring!”79[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts079] At about that time, GeraldHamilton, who was again sharing his flat, passed his open door. “Is that you,Gerald?” he called out. “Where are you going?”“To mass and communion at St. James’s,” Ham answered.“Well, I hope your god tastes nice; you’re such a bloody gourmet.”80[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts080]Circumstances incessantly delayed AC’s California move: first, he could notafford passage; then the visa procedure for British citizens changed. The kickercame when Crowley cabled Germer that he was collecting together the order’sarchives. The message arrived as COLLECTING ARCHIES FRATERNITY. The Germerspuzzled long and hard over this one, until one day Cora discovered that archieswas slang for antiaircraft guns. Karl sat back, pondered this a while, anddeclared, “So, that makes it clear in a way, does it not?”81[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts081]Crowley sent Germer the following retraction on April 2: EQUINOX WORD KUSISMEANING GREAT MOTHER GODDESS STOP ARCHIVES NOT ARCHIES STOP PERIQUE EARLIESTSTOP HUNDRED RECEIVED STOP LOVE CROWLEY. The message contained the equinox word,the spelling correction, a request for more perique tobacco, and anacknowledgment of Germer’s latest contribution to the Great Work. Britishcensors, however, questioned Crowley about the cryptic telegram at least twicebefore sending it; then, on April 12, the American censor refused the telegramoutright. Forced to submit another, Crowley responded with an ever moreridiculous telegram on July 18:MEDICAL METEOROLOGICAL MIX-UP MORTALLY MENACES MAGNANIMOUS MORIBUND MAGUSMUSTN’T MARCH MAIDENHEAD. MAY MARRIAGE MOVE MARY MOTHER MAIDEN MULTIPLYMELLIFLUOUS MUNIFICENCES. MACGREGOR.To his surprise, they accepted it.By then, however, the damage was done. With the war waging in Europe andAmerican citizens of Japanese descent being interred, official paranoia raged.The FBI was investigating persons visiting the U.S. from enemy nations, and onMarch 3 began a file on Germer. Karl was guilty of buying Crowley’s books; hisoccult bookseller told the FBI that Germer admired Hitler’s ideology and thatCrowley was Hitler’s advisor on black magic. These ridiculous claims confirmedthe FBI’s assessment of AC as “a notorious moral pervert.”82[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts082] Thus Germer’s efforts toobtain a visa for Crowley looked suspicious. When that “cryptic” telegramarrived, the FBI repressed it and sealed their fates: despite supportingdocumentation from his doctor, C. H. Cranshaw, Crowley would never receive anAmerican visa, and Germer would remain under investigation until July 1944.The only bright spot for the order was Roy Leffingwell’s plans to turn hisproperty—Rancho Royal off Route 1 in Barstow, California—into a turkey farm anddonate all profits to the tarot publication fund. Crowley’s only complaint wasover the ranch’s logo: Roy preferred to replace the A with a stylized Westernstar, to which Crowley took exception:“Call yourself a cabalist? Bah! Poo! Here you are, with the Word in all itsbeauty and perfection, handed to you on a golden plate, the Key Word, the Wordof Words, the Heart of the whole system of Thelema, and you deliberatelymutilate it, deform it, make the title look like a fad, all for the sake of ameasly two-penny ha’-penny mouldy, mangy Judeo-Christian two-bit pentagram. Howartificial and how incomplete it looks, your Rancho Roy*l. No, no, no. Infuture, please, it’s Rancho RoyAL.”83[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts083]Crowley spent the next weeks moving from residence to residence, seeking a moreor less permanent home. This inconvenience, however, was trivial compared to histension with Frieda over the tarot. Although rationing inflated the cost ofprinting either the book or the cards, they remained committed to seeing thework through, often at cross purposes.For instance, when he received a £15 contribution for printing the cards, ACsent it to Sun Engraving with instructions to add one more trump to the platesthey were making. When he learned that two plates cost £20, he sent anadditional £5 of his own money to get two cards done. All this was news toFrieda, who preferred the savings in printing four cards at a time. When shelearned that Crowley had ordered two more plates set up, she feared she waslosing control of the project and took all her originals back from SunEngraving. She informed Crowley that she would permit nothing lest her businessmanager approved.On May 18, with the approval of Frieda’s manager, AC gave Green the tarot bookmanuscript with instructions to set up Part One.That summer, Agape Lodge moved into a Victorian-style mansion at 1003 SouthOrange Grove in Pasadena, California, to their neighbors’ dismay. This,Parsons’s inheritance, was timely, as the owner of their former abode planned todemolish the building and erect a hotel. The mansion had three floors, sixteenrooms, five baths, and a cellar: just the place for the burgeoning lodge.Coinciding with the move, Smith left his job at the gas company, donating the$1,200 that he received from his employers to the household’s general fund.If Crowley’s sources are to be trusted, they celebrated the move in grand style.“Have had to listen to things that really appalled me,” Crowley complained.“That the Lodge was actually termed a whorehouse is the least. But what a lowclass of a whorehouse!”84 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts084] ToCrowley’s dismay, the Agape Lodge also appeared to have stopped initiations andperformances of the Gnostic Mass. Despite Crowley’s inquiries about the statusof the group, he received only conflicting reports—one rumor had Smith claimingthe exaltedA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]grades of Magister Templi and Magus. Another had Smith using his influence toinduce women initiates into bed with him. Upon learning that Smith was sleepingwith Soror Grimaud—Parsons’s wife—and had gotten her pregnant, Crowley decidedit was time for a shakedown. Smith had to go.Crowley had sent a copy of La Gauloise (“The Gallic One”)—his “England, StandFast!” for the French—to Charles de Gaulle and received a flattering letter fromde Gaulle’s aide that May. Encouraged, he revised the poem and gave it toChiswick Press at the end of June for a print run of one thousand copies. Thesehe distributed all over London. He wanted it broadcast on the BBC, but theyinsisted it first be put to music. Fortunately, Roy Leffingwell offered hisarranging talents. Minor revisions followed when, on July 10, Germer pointed outtwo grammatical errors. “And after 5 Frenchmen had OK’d me, a German spots it!”Crowley laughed. “Symbolic? I fear so.”85[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts085] Next, he changed the name“from ‘Free’ to ‘Fighting’ French,” and thus finished “La Gauloise.”Later in 1942 he received the music for “La Gauloise” from Leffingwell andarranged for a French baritone to record it. He retitled the song “L’Etincelle”(“The Spark”) and anonymously sent the recording to the BBC, which played it onDecember 10. Later, AC would report even greater success with the song toLeffingwell: “McMurtry took your tune to Normandy, and there is a great premiereof La Gauloise in a town and on a date unnamed for security’s sake.”86[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts086]While Crowley worked on war poetry, Frieda rallied support for the tarot byappearing on radio talk shows and at lectures. On July 1 the Berkeley Galleriesin London exhibited the cards. Despite their agreement to present the workanonymously, the exhibition credited her as the artist … with no mention ofCrowley. In addition, a new catalog for the show was put together, containing anumber of serious errors that AC considered amateurish and feared woulddisrcredit the work. “No word of credit to the Order,” he complained. “She hasno self-respect.” He nevertheless found comfort in knowing the deck wasunmistakably his design: the XX (The Aeon) card he identified as the Crowleycoat of arms, and the Ace of Disks, which traditionally bore the artist’ssignature, was inscribed with the name TO MEGA THERION.87[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts087]An August 4 exhibit at the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours on ConduitStreet followed the Berkeley Galleries exhibition. Learning of this show,Crowley remarked, “Again, she didn’t tell me.”88[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c21-nts088] He feared Frieda was stealingall the credit for their work, and his friends encouraged this perception. ThusCrowley appeared unexpectedly at the exhibit’s opening on August 4, confrontinga stupefied Frieda Harris, who stammered something about how she had just senthim a letter about the show. Coolly, he replied, “I knew about it on Saturdaymorning.” It was difficult to stay angry at her, however. Aside from the“abominable Mercury” on the program’s cover, Crowley thought the show wasperfect. Aside from printing, the tarot project was essentially done (barringminor details). When Crowley moved into 93 Jermyn Street, just off London’sPiccadilly Circus, that November, Frieda began weaning Crowley off his £2 weeklystipend; since Germer had sent Crowley around £800 in 1942 alone, he managed.On November 4 Old Crow dug out his poem “The Fun of the Fair.” Lamenting that itnever appeared as scheduled in the October 1914 English Review, he decided topublish it for Christmas. Dedicating it to Karl’s new wife, Sascha—whom hemarried on September 23, about two months after Cora’s death—he sent themanuscript to Louis Wilkinson for an introduction, then to Chiswick Press forprinting. He tried to sneak “Landed Gentry” into Fun of the Fair, but Chiswickstill rejected it. He finally made copies at a local duplicating place and wouldinsert them loose into the booklet himself.Toward the end of the month he wrote a prospectus for the poem, claiming “Thisbook will be as expensive and nice as this prospectus is cheap and nasty.” Healso had a photographer named Churchill take his portrait for the booklet. ByNovember 30 the proofs and the photographs were ready. Three weeks later, onDecember 22, 1942, at 11:31 a.m.—the winter solstice—Crowley ceremoniallypublished The Fun of the Fair. It was published by OTO, whose address was givenas “Rancho RoyAL, Route I, Barstow, Cal., USA and at 93 Jermyn Street, LondonSW1.”[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_083_r1.jpg]Crowley’s portrait from Fun of the Fair (1942).

Withthis tragedy, Crowley’s American publication fund vanished.In other order business, Crowley entrusted Jane Wolfe, his disciple oftwenty-three years, to carry out orders to depose Smith. Although she haddefended the lodge master in the past, she obediently complied with AC’s wishes,writing Smith on January 13:Pursuant to instructions from Baphomet, it is my duty to inform you that, forthe time being, you will be relieved from your function in the Lodge, and thatyou will retire from the Community House at 1003 South Orange Grove Avenue,Pasadena. Your full reinstatement will follow the achievement of some definitepersonal action conceived and executed by yourself alone to the advancement ofthe work of the Order.4 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts004]The other lodge members, as loyal to Smith as they were to Crowley, objected.Parsons begged Baphomet to reconsider, stressing that the lodge was coming alongwell and that this division of authority would upset everything. Even Smithbegan a vitriolic exchange with Crowley on his own behalf:In 1936 I was a whoremonger, dishonest, a black magician.… Now I am a clown,vile, and have a swelled head. Personally, I cannot take these criticisms tooseriously because I do not take myself too seriously because the accusations areso positively stupid and false.… You seem so often to be responsible for thecontinual disturbances. Just as we are trying our hardest to get out a smallmonthly publication of dignity and quality which we hope will please you, got aquotation on it, figured how we can squeeze it into our expenses, you let flyanother charge of buckshot or tell somebody else to. I say, “Hell, what’s theuse!”, write a few strongly worded letters, throw them in the fire, clench myteeth, and make another effort. Oh, yes, feeble if you will: We are not allA.C.s.5 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts005]Crowley responded by criticizing Smith for sending lodge reports irregularly andfor lacking the proper stature to act as priest in the Gnostic Mass. AC, whosought a Hollywood production of the rite, imagined someone with more stagepresence. “I do not think that in 20 years or more you contributed more than£150 at the very outside.”6 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts006]This accusation was completely false, and ignited an angry spate of hostilitybetween them. “Wherever Smith was,” Crowley complained, “there was a fermentabout A objecting to B sleeping with C because D wanted E to sleep with F and soon through the alphabet about six times round. In the early days in California,the only letters I ever got were asking me to settle all sorts of rather dirtycomplications.”7 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts007]Yet another problem arose that spring when the FBI scrutinized Jack Parsons’sOTO membership. Because he worked on classified projects for the government, histies to a group “alleged to have been involved in immoral activities”8[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts008] concerned them. Parsonsexplained that the Church of Thelema, which he had joined three yearspreviously, was a small fraternity modeled after England’s Order of OrientalTemplars. Their ideologies, he assured them, opposed communism and fascism, andagreed entirely with the war effort. “We are entirely tolerant and concernedwith the brotherhood of all mankind, and dedicated to individual freedom andliberty.” The investigators searched the lodge with Smith’s permission,including his correspondence with AC, and found nothing subversive.Crowley pushed on with Olla for the first months of 1943, hoping for itsceremonial publication on the spring equinox. When informed in February thatChiswick couldn’t possibly have an entire book ready by then, AC decided, “Fine,we’ll do The City of God instead. It will save me a lot of immediate cash.”9[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts009] It would also make a nicecompanion to “The Fun of the Fair.” So, Churchill prepared a new set of photoproofs, and on March 13, Crowley finished the dedication and preface. By then,however, it was too late to set up and print The City of God by the equinox;they were already quite busy with the tarot book. Anxious to release the book onan auspicious date, Crowley took the delays ungraciously. “Chiswick Press calmlyannounces ‘City’ not ready ’till Wednesday next!” he noted in his journal forApril 15, 1943. “What bastards of bastards!”10[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts010] The book finally appeared onApril 20, in a format uniform with the gray paper covers of Fun of the Fair andin a limited edition of two hundred. From there, he continued with other bookprojects.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_084_r1.jpg]Crowley from The City of God (1943). (photo credit 22.1)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c22-fig001a]While revising his text for the small tarot cards that summer, the solution tohis problems with Smith occurred to him: it was, in a word, apotheosis. W. T.Smith was not a man but a god. AC decided that Smith’s astrological chartindicated a latent deity within him, and that realizing his divinity wouldrequire a protracted Great Magical Retirement, during which time he could havecontact with nobody but Germer. While Smith retired to the desert to live in ashack, meditating until the god within him spoke, Parsons would take charge ofAgape Lodge. Crowley sent these instructions to Smith as “Liber Apotheosis” andtelegrammed instructions to Agape Lodge that Smith was off limits under threatof expulsion. Proud of his scheme to dump Smith and appoint young Jack Parsonsas the new lodge master, Crowley bragged to Max Schneider, “I had Machiavelliunder my pillow and dreamed it.”11[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts011]Smith recognized “Apotheosis” as an inelegant plan to depose him yet had nochoice but to comply. Frater 132 withdrew to the desert on June 3, bringing theletters Crowley had sent him over the years. At age fifty-eight—having devotedthe last thirty-seven years of his life to seeking occult wisdom, twenty-nineyears after helping Achad found the original Agape Lodge in Vancouver—he finallygave up. On August 13, Wilfred T. Smith left the desert for the mundane world.12[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts012]Having moved to Piccadilly Circus under the assumption that the bombings inLondon had stopped, Old Crow was dismayed when they resumed that spring. Bysummer they got so bad that Hamilton left the city. Lord Evan Tredegar, an MI5acquaintance and student of magick who was pouring his wealth into properlyoutfitting a temple, invited AC to stay with him. On June 17, 1943, having sent“Apotheosis” to California, he left for Tredegar Park. The lord was working onhis own tarot book, and the occultists passed time comparing notes. Of his host,Crowley wrote, “He’s one of the very few people I know who can throw a party,”and “Tredegar owns 121,000 acres in S. Wales (mostly coal) and whole streets inLondon (mostly bombed).”13 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts013]During his stay, AC also befriended Cordelia Sutherland (1894–1980). Born EmilyCordelia Landers, she married John J. Sutherland at Middlesex in 1926 and workedfor the past fourteen years as Tredegar’s housekeeper, secretary, and manager.14[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts014] Being released when Tredegarsold his country home, she began a long correspondence with AC, occasionallysending powdered chocolate and plover’s eggs his way. After staying for twoweeks in Tredegar’s best room, Crowley returned to London to continue his tarotwork.At the end of October a gray and withered Crowley answered a knock on the doorof his 93 Jermyn Street apartment. Standing before him was a young American armycaptain with round glasses, a mustache, and a smirk. “News from the frontindeed!” Crowley remarked.15 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts015]Grady McMurtry—along with the rest of his ROTC class—had been called to activeduty in February 1942. Since the Italian government had surrendered to theAllies on September 3, 1943, McMurtry was on leave from the 1803rd and decidedto visit the master. During his visits in the following weeks—when he and ACgenerally talked late into the night—he met Yorke, Harris, and Wilkinson.Although his visits only numbered about six in all, he endeared himself greatlyto AC, loaning him £50 and buying copies of his books. He was young yetlevel-headed, a breath of reason amidst the California madness. Crowley seizedthe opportunity to advance him to the IX°, skipping the II° through the VIII°.As a IX° member, Grady needed a magical motto but uncertain about a fitting one,he deferred to AC. Agonizing over the matter, Crowley came up with the Greekmotto “Hymenaeus Alpha,” which added up to the mystical number 777.At this time, Crowley offered McMurtry a fifty percent share of the tarot bookin exchange for a $200 investment. AC figured he could defray the prohibitivecost of publishing Olla by having Chiswick buy an extra-large stock of paper forthe tarot book at a better discount and use the surplus to print Olla. By theend of March 1944, McMurtry accepted the offer.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_085_r1.jpg]Grady Louis McMurtry (1918–1985). (photo credit 22.2)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c22-fig002a]As 1943 drew to a close, AC’s projects became even more ambitious and consuming.Besides Olla and the tarot he encouraged his friends to ask him for letters ofinstruction on remedial points of magick; these he hoped to collect and publishunder the working title of Aleister Explains Everything. Questions posed toCrowley ranged from “Do angels cut themselves shaving?” to “Why accept sorevolting a book as Liber AL?” Its writing filled most of the months to followand would take years to complete.Early in 1944 some metaphysical literature distributed by Dr. William BernardCrow (1895–1976) caught his attention. Crow was a lecturer in biology forseveral colleges, the latest being South West Essex Technical College. Educatedat the University of London, he was a fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine,Linnean Society, and Zoological Society of London.16[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts016] He wrote extensively not onlyon biology but also on many occult topics17[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts017] and was a contributor to theOccult Review.18 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts018] He was alsoconnected with various spiritual groups like the Institute for Cosmic Studiesand the Ancient Orthodox Catholic Church; on June 13, 1943, he was consecratedbishop as Mar Basilius Abdullah III, enabling him to act as autocephalous headof his own church, the Order of the Holy Wisdom or Ekklesia Agiae Sophiae. Thepurpose of this church was to teach the “Orthodox Catholic Faith” to occultistsin their own vernacular. According to one of his fliers, the church incorporatedthe traditions of the Hindus, kabbalists, gnostics, Zoroastrians, Rosicrucians,Druids, Buddhists and Sufis.When Crowley sent him comments in early February, a correspondence ensued. Crowwas a serious and knowledgeable student of the occult, was curious aboutCrowley’s Memphis-Mizraim lineage, and wished to work the Gnostic Mass. Beforelong, Crow’s advisor, Hugh George de Willmott Newman (b. 1905), also known asthe Archbishop Mar Georgius I, Metropolitan of Glastonbury in the Catholicate ofthe West,19 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts019] contacted Crowleyto negotiate an authorization. The EGC and Gnostic Mass were particularly sacredto Crowley, and he felt Crow out carefully before granting anything. Crowley wasamused by these episcopi vagantes, or wandering bishops: Crow reportedly kept astatue of Buddha that he called St. Jehosaphat.20[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts020] Newman, meanwhile, signed hisname with numerous titles and initials.The Beast yawned elaborately. Mottoes and titles had long since failed toimpress him, ever since he filled pages of The Equinox with all the titlesconferred upon him after the Mathers lawsuit. Masonic authority and succession,another of their concerns, were subjects that bored Crowley even more. Henevertheless strived to set them on the right path. About the EGC, Crowley said,“I never wrote any rituals of ordination and such things, and I am certainly notgoing to start at my time of life. The people in America go on perfectly wellwithout anything of the sort.”21[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts021] Regarding the Mass, headvised, “Keep one eye fixed firm on Hollywood. You mustn’t have a Priest with asqueak or a drone or a drawling, and you mustn’t cast some frightful hag as theVirgin Harlot. The furniture, robes, etc. may at first be severely plain, but aspestilence is the pretentious, the theatrical or the tawdry.”22[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts022]Crow pursued this for a while, distributing flyers to drum up interest in theMass, but he and Newman eventually parted. In Crowley’s mind the doctor had aways to go. “You are quite wrong in thinking that The Wizard of Oz has anythingto do with me,” he told Crow. “That was the title of a film which I did not see,but I could not change the title of my book because … Hollywood chose to pinchthe word.”23 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts023] To be fair, L.Frank Baum’s (1856–1919) The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, on which the movie isbased, came out in 1900, the year of the GD revolt against Mathers and overforty years before Crowley penned Liber Oz. Ironically, a few years later thefilm came to Hastings while Crowley was living at Netherwood House; AC very muchwanted to see it, only to be told by the proprietress, “It wouldn’t interest youat all, it’s a children’s thing.”24[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts024]The year 1944 started off with a bang as intense air raids frequently shookCrowley’s abode. As he wrote to Louis Wilkinson, “My nerves just went with abang.”25 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts025] His diaries recordmany episodes, including the following:Blast knocked house about quite a little. Other tenants behaved very well (i.e.,they go to the kitchen & huddle, & ‘make cheerful talk’: They cannot bear to bealone: it comforts them to hold each others’ hands! They depressed me almostmore than the company of such people normally does).26[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts026]Shortly after he received an eviction notice on February 16, a bomb landed 250yards southwest of 93 Jermyn, leveling most of King and Duke streets. Duckingoutside to look, Crowley stepped into a hailstorm of rubble and shrapnel. Whenhe sought shelter indoors and started upstairs, an explosion blew the lock offthe door and knocked him over.Although Crowley tried fairly successfully to maintain a normal lifestyle, theconstant raids took their toll. Driven north of London on April 8, he took aroom at the famous Bell Inn at Aston Clinton, Buckinghamshire. It was a statelyseventeenth century country hotel with twenty rooms, huge bathtubs, a large openfire, and a talented cook; Crowley however felt far from his friends, bored, andlonely.That spring he prepared an eight-page prospectus for the tarot book, officiallydubbed The Book of Thoth, and began selling subscriptions in May. Heenthusiastically claimed “These cards, with the explanatory Essay, are destinedto be the Atlas and Practical manual of all Magick for the next 2,000 years.”27[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts27] He found takers in McMurtry,Sutherland, Tredegar, and Bayley as well as E. N. Fitzgerald, Dion Fortune, andothers. Yorke even contributed £100 toward publication costs. These prospectuseswere the source of some concern after they were mailed, owing to wartimerationing. As AC wrote:it seems that I may have technically infringed one of those fool regulationsabout sending out prospectuses free of charge, but luckily The Book of Thoth isNo 5 of Vol III of The Equinox, which constitutes it a periodical and thereforenot subject to the paper control at all. Of course it is very trivial andtechnical: but considering how I have been framed up in the past, and how manywolves are out after my blood, I must confess to more than a littleapprehension.28 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts028]Crowley needn’t have worried, as his publication appeared without incident.Although The Book of Thoth gives a publication date on the spring equinox of1944, Crowley was still signing the unbound sheets that August; indeed, hearranged with legendary bookbinders Sangorski and Sutcliffe to bind the books asorders arrived; hence not all copies were bound at the same time. Nevertheless,the signed and numbered edition did appear that year. In November, Crowleyexpressed delight at the initial sales of the book: “To my amazement I have soldover fifty copies of The Book of Thoth. If you had told me six months ago Iwould have said, in my most optimistic mood, that I could get rid of a dozen.”29[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts029] It was a spectacular book,with eleven copies bound in half morocco leather and the rest inquarter-leather, gilt-samped with the OTO logo and seal of Ankh-f-n-Khonsu onthe spine. It was printed on mold-made paper, which was not only elegant butalso exempt from wartime paper restrictions. The book contained nine colorplates of the cards, technical appendices, and a bibliographic note (by Crowleybut attributed to Martha Küntzel). Authorship was attributed to “The MasterTherion,” with Frieda Harris listed as artist executant. Crowley inscribed hercopy,To my dearest Sister TzBA 93,My admired accomplice in the perpetration of this atrocity.…To Mega Therion 66630 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts030]The book has since become the definitive work on the tarot and has enjoyed manyreprintings. Although test printings of several cards were made at this time,the deck was was not printed in either collaborator’s lifetime despite repeatedattempts. The first color edition was produced by Llewellyn in 1971.31[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts031]The fall of 1944 was also notable not for anything that Crowley accomplished butfor a fascinating glimpse of what could have been. The American OTO members werestill hoping to import Old Crow to California, and a new twist developed: JeanSchneider was working as a housekeeper for film director Orson Welles(1915–1985). She sent AC the book for Citizen Kane; although the 1941 film—whichWelles wrote, directed, and performed in—is considered by many the best movieever made, it was a financial failure in its theatrical release. Schneiderhinted that Welles was interested in magick. In December she sent the telegramGAVE ORSON WELLES MORTADELLO. Crowley must have been excited, as this was theplay he had been shopping around to producers for years. He also asked her togive him “Across the Gulf” and The Three Wishes to consider for screenplays.32[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts032] Alas, no movie deals wereforthcoming.During his last visit, McMurtry accompanied Crowley on a drive along the Seineup to the cathedral town of Chartres. AC had already called him “the mostserious and intelligent of the younger lot.… This singles you out as the properman to take charge of affairs when the time is ripe. It is supremely importantthat you should understand fully the 9th degree.…”33[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts033] Now—having participated in theInvasion of Normandy and the liberation of France and Belgium—McMurtry was againvisiting. As they drove, they discussed the future of OTO, Crowley spoke for thefirst time of the office of Caliph. Denoting the successor to a prophet inIslam, such a position exists in none of the official OTO documents, itscharter, the blue Equinox, or anywhere else. Thus, when Crowley later referredto the Caliphate in an October 16 letter to McMurtry, the puzzled servicemanreplied, “As for the Caliphate, I remember no concrete proposal—just a vaguereference once.”34 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts034] Crowleyresponded at length:“The Caliphate.” You must realize that no matter how closely we may seeeye-to-eye on any objective subject, I have to think on totally differentpremises where the Order is concerned. One of the (startlingly few) commandsgiven to me was this: “Trust not a stranger: fail not of an heir.” This has beenthe very devil for me. Frater Saturnus is of course the natural Caliph; butthere are many details concerning the actual policy or working which hit hisblind spots. In any case, he can only be a stopgap, because of his age; I haveto look for his successor. It has been hell; so many have come up with amazingpromise, only to go on the rocks.…But—now here is where you have missed my point altogether—I do not think of youas lying on a grassy hillside with a lot of dear sweet lovely woolly lambs,capering to your flute! On the contrary. Your actual life, or “blooding,” is thesort of initiation which I regard as the first essential for a Caliph. For—say20 years hence—the Outer Head of the Order must, among other things, have hadthe experience of war as it is an actual fact to-day.35[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts035]Just as Crowley left behind a son and a publishing program, he also planned aline of succession. He gave McMurtry “more solid instruction in IX° than I evergave before to any one.”36 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts036] Hewas grooming McMurtry for bigger things.“It is infinitely dark, dull, damp, depressing, dirty, drear, dead anddecomposing in this hideous hell-hole,” he wrote of the Bell Inn when thebombings and loneliness became too much,37[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts037] and he asked Louis Wilkinsonto help him find a new home. It turned out that his son, Oliver, knew E. C.Vernon Symonds through the Hastings Court Players. Symonds was an ex-alcoholic,actor, and playwright who in 1930 wrote The Legend of Abd-El-Krim.38[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts038] He and his wife Kathleen, whowent by the name “Johnny,” had turned a gloomy Victorian mansion into an“intellectual guest house” named Netherwood. They tempted various luminaries tocome for a visit and offer a talk to the other guests in exchange for a freeroom and meals. Some of their speakers included philosopher and broadcaster C.E. M. Joad (1891–1953), geneticist and evolutionary biologist J. B. S. Haldane(1892–1964), aristocrat and communist Edith Hajós Bone (1889–1975), andmathematician and biologist Jacob Bronowski (1908–1974). In addition, a youngJulian Bream (b. 1933) occasionally played classical guitar for the guests.39[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts039]Surrounded by four wooded acres and located on the Ridge, the highest point ofHastings at an elevation of five hundred feet, it offered panoramic views of thetown, the sea, and Crowley’s childhood haunt, Beachy Head. It was the perfectplace for an aging magician to retire, with Symonds’s house rules reading:Guests are requested not to tease the Ghosts.Guests are requested to be as quiet as possible while dying of fright.Breakfast will be served at 9 a.m. to the survivors of the Night.The Hastings Borough Cemetery is five minutes walk away (ten minutes if carryingbody), but it is only one minute as the Ghost flies.Guests are requested not to dig graves on lawns, but to make full use of newlyfilled graves under trees.Guests are requested not to remove corpses from graves or to cut down bodiesfrom trees.The Office has a certain amount of used clothing for sale, the property ofguests who have no longer any use for earthly raiment.40[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts040]Also staying at Netherwood House was world-famed chess champion Edward MackenzieJackson (1867–1959), eleven-time winner of the Hastings Chess ClubChampionship.41 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts041] There was alsoanother skilled player named Kirk.In advance of his arrival, Crowley reputedly telegrammed Netherwood House toexpect a consignment of frozen meat. This rather perplexed the Symondses, whohad placed no such order. All became clear when Crowley arrived on the appointedday in an ambulance. bearing his belongings, He insisted on having room number13.42 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts042] He moved in on January17, 1945, lining his small room with his books and paintings. In gratitude, hesent a box of cigars to Oliver. When Oliver smoked them all before realizingthey were the world’s most expensive cigars, Crowley sent him a second box.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_086_r1.jpg]Netherwood House, The Ridge, Hastings, where Crowley spent his last years.(photo credit 22.3) [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c22-fig003a]Kenneth Grant (b. 1924) had a dream in 1939 of a powerful magical symbol and itsassociated name, spelled variously A’ashik, Oshik, or Aossic. Becoming a youngstudent of magick three years later, he adopted the emblem and nomen. He hadtried in vain to reach Crowley through the address given in Magick, which wasover a decade old at the time. Then, when The Book of Thoth appeared in 1944,Michael Houghton refused to give him AC’s current address, fearing young Grantto be “mentally unstable”;43 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts043]Grant presumed that Houghton merely wanted to recruit him into his own Societyof Hidden Masters.44 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts044] Hepersevered and finally tracked down Crowley at the Bell Inn, where he firstvisited and met the master in late 1944. During these years, Grant had,volunteered for the army at age eighteen and by age twenty was invalided fromservice for an unspecified medical condition.45[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts045]Through the winter of 1945, Grant sent letters and books to Crowley. Thus whenCrowley decided at the end of February that he needed a secretary, this eageryoung student, as Regardie before him, seemed the logical choice. What Grantlacked in secretarial skills he made up for in exuberance. “I made a bargainwith Symonds,” Crowley wrote. “It’s supposed to cost me £1.0.0 a week to havehim here.”46 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts046] Accepting theoffer, Grant arranged to join Crowley on March 9. On the appointed day he wiredCrowley that he had been delayed and would arrive on Sunday, March 11. Hefinally appeared on March 12.Using ether as an aid, Crowley taught Grant astral projection until he couldobtain similar, although less spectacular, results without drugs.47[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts047] He was a good student, andCrowley saw great promise in him. “I am trying to get him to look after me andmy work,” he wrote to Louis Wilkinson. “A definite gift from the Gods.”48[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts048] Grant, however, was far fromhome and pining for his lady love; in addition, as he recalls, “I was unableever to acquire a practical approach to mundane affairs … which so exasperatedCrowley.”49 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts049] Thus, AC’spatience for Grant wore thin. When Grant disingenuously tried convincing hisemployer to return to London, Crowley mused, “The murderer’s puzzle, how to getrid of the body, has been on my nerves for the last two days.”50[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts050] Two weeks later, Crowley’stongue sharpened and, during an argument with Grant, he blurted, “You are themost consummate BORE that the world has yet known. And this at 20!”51[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts051] Later, however, Crowleyreflected, “I feel that I may have treated him too severely.”52[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts052]On April 11, Crowley certified McMurtry a IX° member of OTO and owner oftwenty-five percent of the copyright of “Aleister Explains Everything,” nowofficially Magick without Tears. A greater honor fell on him when Crowleyexpressed his umbrage over the situation in California and the contradictoryaccounts he received by mail. “I may be the world’s greatest magician, but Ineed some facts to go on!”“Well,” Grady suggested, “you know me, and I know them. When I get home, I’llsurvey the situation and write you a report.” Crowley thereupon appointed himSovereign Grand Inspector General of the Order.53[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts053]The months that followed were tumultuous: President Roosevelt died on April 12during his fourth term in office, Russian troops entered Berlin eight dayslater, Mussolini was assassinated on April 28, and Hitler committed suicideshortly thereafter. The Allies announced victory in Europe on May 8.Days after Hitler was announced dead, AC gave Grant the sketch that hadaccompanied his commentary on “The Voice of the Silence” in the blue Equinox.Then, on May 14, Grant announced that he was returning to London. This angeredCrowley, but also came as a bit of a relief.In London he had been A1; here he broke down altogether. Memory went west; youcouldn’t trust him to do anything; he would leave me with the impression that hehad done it when he had shelved it or forgotten altogether. Then, silly thingslike signing & posting letters that should have come to me fair-copied forrevision & signature. He got worse every week.54[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts054]After returning to London, Grant helped AC oversee business there. May 16, theday of Grant’s departure, would be the last time he would see Crowley alive.That June, AC complained to Wilkinson that he was still “dog-tired trying toclean up after Grant!”55 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts055]It was difficult for Crowley to fault him for wanting to be with his love.Looking back over his own romantic conquests, Crowley listed eighty names hecould recall and saw how devoid of true love most of them were. “Henceforth,” hesolemnly vowed, “I, Perdurabo, whose benign bum now permits him to stroll thestreets of Hastings, shall never fail to tip my hat to every courting couple Iencounter.”56 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts056]During the goings-on with Grant and McMurtry, the Occult Review published asix-page appreciation of AC titled “Aleister Crowley, Poet and Occultist.” Itsauthor, Frederick Henry Amphlett Micklewright (1908–1992), was an Anglicanpriest (1935) and fellow of the Royal Historical Society who had been educatedat Oxford and the Anglican theological college Ripon Hall. Interested in unusualforms of religion, he contributed a series of articles to the Occult Reviewduring the 1940s; his article on Crowley was quite laudatory:It is not always the case that the poems of occultists are essential to anunderstanding of their work. But Aleister Crowley is fundamentally an artist. Heis a creative personality, expressing his individuality in terms of rhythm. Hissense of the rhythmic, which ultimately implies the sense of a fundamentalbeauty, is aptly expressed whether in prose or in verse; his art is a necessaryentrance to an understanding of his occultism.57[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts057]Crowley might have missed the article had W. B. Crow not asked if he’d seen thelatest issue. Crowley responded, “I have not seen a copy of the Occult Review,unless by accident, since [Ralph] Shirley left it [in 1925]. I did not know thatit printed anything serious at all nowadays.”58[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts058] Even so, it appears from hisdiary that AC did not see the article until 1946. He was very pleased, writingto Crow that Amphlett Micklewright “has done a supreme thing; he has shown acoherent and consistent pattern in my work from first to last.… He has shown mewhat I didn’t know about myself.”59[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts059] He told his student FrederickMellinger that it was the “best thing that’s happened to me in 100 years!”60[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts060]The world would never be the same after July 16, 1945. That day, the firstatomic bomb test occurred in New Mexico; weeks later on August 6, the UnitedStates dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima. Crowley pondered if this was the warengine mentioned in The Book of the Law, writing to Louis Wilkinson, “The‘Atomic Bomb’ is interesting, not only because of Liber AL III.7–8, but becauseone of the men who were working on it was for some time at the Abbey inCefalù.”61 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts061] After the secondbomb fell on Nagasaki, AC left a cryptic entry in his diary:O.T.O. Ophidian vibrations. Non-filterable virus. X-ray dermatitis. “Gallopingcancer.” Amrita. NUITh Nitrogen Uranium Iodine (& sea-life) Theriumm = New Atom666. Atomic No.: 93. H A D 6 plus 5 A D = He.62[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts062]A cold, black sky scowled at the world on New Year’s Day 1946. Professor E. M.Butler looked out her train window at the turbulent sea, too nervous to prepareto interview Aleister Crowley for her book The Myth of the Magus. Crowley’sreputation was as enormous as it was sinister, and she feared the inclementweather was somehow wound up with his evil.Eliza Marian Butler (1885–1959) was the third of seven Anglo-Irish children toTheobald Fitzwalter Butler (1845–1914) and Catherine Elizabeth Barraclough (d.1946). Educated at Newnham College (Cambridge) and Bonn University, she became alecturer at her alma mater in 1914, where she would remain for much of hercareer, writing books on language and literature, especially German. From 1936she was professor of German at Manchester University, but returned to Cambridgein 1945, where she remained until her 1951 retirement. She would be ProfessorEmeritus at Cambridge and receive an honorary doctorate in literature fromOxford in 1958.63 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts063]She was surprised to arrive at Hastings to find not the Prince of Darkness but apolite and friendly scarecrow of a septuagenarian. “Do what thou wilt shall bethe whole of the Law,” he greeted her. “And a Happy New Year to you, MissButler.” After Crowley’s lunchtime discussion of Thelema failed to impress her,they retired to his room for cognac and the interview. She did it in twosessions: from lunch until high tea, then again that evening.Butler had a structuralist model of the myth of the magus, much as ClaudeLévi-Strauss (1908–2009) had developed the traditional pattern of the hero myth.According to her research, great magi usually claimed a supernatural birth, witha childhood surrounded by portents and perils, and so on. Crowley denied thesetraits but admitted having undergone initiations. He cited the GD and hiscontact with Aiwass as instances of these. When Butler asked about a period ofquesting to distant lands for occult knowledge, Crowley listed his voyages toMexico, India, Ceylon, Burma, Egypt, and China.“Have you had a contest with a rival magician?” she asked him.“Never,” he answered proudly. “I have no rival.”When asked about having blinding visions of beauty, glory, and truth, Crowleyreadily agreed. He took up The Book of the Law and read:Behold! the rituals of the old time are black. Let the evil ones be cast away;let the good be purged by the prophet! Then shall this Knowledge go aright. I amthe flame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core of every star. I amLife and the giver of Life, yet therefore is the knowledge of me the knowledgeof death. I am the Magician and the Exorcist.When Butler looked up from her note-taking, she saw him crying. Wiping his eyeswith his hand, he whispered, “It was a revelation of love.”Crowley was a gentleman, escorting her back to her hotel and paying for hermeals at Netherwood; he would later send her Frieda Harris’s “Punch and Judy”sketches as a gift. Butler nevertheless sneaked away from Netherwood early thenext morning, shuddering as if she had just vacated a shunned house; she laterconfessed to Yorke that the Beast had frightened her. His statement “Magic isnot a way of life, it is the way of life” echoed menacingly in her head, and shewrote only a couple of sentences about him in The Myth of the Magus.Ironically, AC described their meeting in an entirely different light:“Professor Butler of Newnham came … and talked (and made me talk) with suchsympathy, consideration, and understanding that the day was a dream of joy!”64[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts064] It was a pleasant change fromhis incessant sickness and chronic depression.He spent the next months correcting Olla, sending the finished proofs to Guys onMarch 25. When he wrote his old friend Augustus John to request a sketch for thebook, the artist gladly obliged and planned to visit that summer. “So glad tohear you keep signing ‘do what thou wilt,’ ” he wrote. “How right you are.”65[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts065] With that settled, Crowleytook up one other project: prodding Wilkinson to edit a popular edition of TheBook of the Law and its comment.After Helen jilted him in 1945, Jack Parsons transferred his affections to hersister, Sara Elizabeth Northrup (1924–1997). Known as Betty, she was a studentat the University of Southern California, although she soon dropped out andmoved in with Jack, becoming his partner in sex magick rituals.In August of 1945, L. Ron Hubbard appeared on the scene. He had not yet writtenon Scientology, for which he is best known; at this time he was known simply asa science fiction writer and naval lieutenant. Lafayette Ronald Hubbard(1911–1986) was born in Tilden, Nebraska, to a military family and moved arounda lot as a child. He attended George Washington University but, more interestedin contributing to the school newspaper and literary journals, he left after twoyears without taking a degree. During the 1930s he published several novels anddozens of short stories in pulp magazines like Astounding Science Fiction andUnknown Worlds, becoming well-known in the science fiction and fantasycommunities. He had entered the navy in 1941 and served for four years. Whenscience fiction illustrator Lou Goldstone, a frequent visitor to the mansion onOrange Grove, introduced him to Agape Lodge, Parsons, a fan of science fiction,befriended Hubbard. Together with Betty, they soon founded the company “AlliedEnterprises” to buy yachts on the east coast and sail them to California, wherethey could be resold at a profit.66[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts066]Their friendship became strained, however, when Hubbard, although married, begansleeping with Betty. As Parsons described:About three months ago I met Ron … a writer and explorer of whom I had known forsome time.… He is a gentleman; he has red hair, green eyes, is honest andintelligent, and we have become great friends. He moved in with me about twomonths ago, and although Betty and I are still friendly, she has transferred hersexual affections to Ron.Although Ron has no formal training in magick, he has an extraordinary amount ofexperience and understanding in the field. From some of his experiences I deducethat he is in direct touch with some higher intelligence, possibly his guardianangel. Ron appears to have some sort of highly developed astral vision. Hedescribed his angel as a beautiful winged woman with red hair, whom he calls theEmpress, and who has guided him through his life, and saved him many times.67[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts067]Twice jilted, Parsons began on January 4, 1946, a series of rituals known as theBabalon Working. He wished to summon an air elemental and thereby cause Babalonto be born in this world. The workings involved a variety of systems, includingthe Enochian tablet of air, the invoking ritual of the pentagram and theAugoeides. In the Mojave Desert on January 18, while conducting another of therituals with Hubbard, Parsons watched the setting sun and declared flatly, “Itis done.” Returning to Agape Lodge, Parsons found a new visitor there: MarjorieCameron. He concluded his ritual had been a success.Marjorie Cameron Parsons Kimmel (1922–1995) was born on April 22, 1922, in BellePlaine, Iowa.68 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts068] She was thefirst of four children to a churchgoing family whose father, Hill L. Cameron(1902–1962), was a railroad worker.69[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts069] After graduating fromDavenport High School in 1940—finding her artistic and mystical bent at oddswith her small-town community—she enlisted in the Navy, where she worked in aphotographic unit and drew maps. During the war she learned that her brotherJames, a tail-gunner, had been injured in action and rushed back home to Iowa tobe by his side; declared AWOL, she was confined to base from the time of herreturn until her honorable discharge in 1945. From there she, along with herfamily, resettled in Pasadena. No longer a map-drawer, she began working as afashion illustrator. Shortly thereafter she met Jack Parsons.70[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts070]For the next nine days, Parsons performed a series of invocations of Babalon,for which Hubbard acted as scribe. Shortly thereafter, on February 28, Parsonswas back in the Mojave Desert, where he received The Book of Babalon, ostensiblythe fourth chapter to The Book of the Law. When Cameron became pregnant, Parsonsconcluded she would give birth to Babalon.Describing his success to Crowley, Parsons attributed his devastating success to“the IX° working with the girl who answered my elemental summons.… I have beenin direct touch with One who is most Holy and Beautiful, mentioned in The Bookof the Law.”71 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts071] AC’s reply waslukewarm:I am particularly interested in what you have written to me about the elemental,because for some little time past I have been endeavoring to intervenepersonally in this matter on your behalf. I would however have you recall Lévi’saphorism: ‘The love of the Magus for such things is insensate and destroyshim.’72 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts072]With Germer, he was more candid: “Apparently he … is producing a Moonchild. Iget fairly frantic when I contemplate the idiocy of these louts.”73[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts073] In the midst of escalatingproblems with Agape Lodge, Crowley gave McMurtry the following document:This is to authorize Frater Hymenaeus Alpha (Capt. Grady L. McMurtry) to takecharge of the whole work of the Order in California to reform the Organizationin pursuance of his report of January 25, ’46 e.v. subject to the approval ofFrater Saturnus (Karl J. Germer). This authorization is to be used only inemergency.74 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts074]He followed this letter with another stating, “These presents are to appointFrater Hymenaeus Alpha, Grady Louis McMurtry IX° O.T.O., as Our representativein the United States of America and his authority is to be considered as Ours,subject to the approval, revision, or veto of Our Viceroy, Karl Johannes GermerIX° O.T.O.”75 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts075] These documentsassured Crowley that if everything in Pasadena crashed, McMurtry was empoweredto step in and put it back together. “I think it is best to leave as much inyour hands as possible,” Crowley told him, “as you are more or less on the spotand appear to be full of youth and energy as ever.”76[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts076]The time soon arrived for Allied Enterprises to purchase its first yacht, andJack agreed that Ron and Betty would take $10,000 of his money to the EastCoast, buy the boat, and sail it back to California. Unbeknownst to Parsons,Hubbard had asked the Chief of Naval Personnel for permission to sail to SouthAmerica and China; he had no intention of returning. After a couple of weekspassed with no word from his partners, Parsons deduced this for himself. Not tobe taken in, Jack took a train to Miami and discovered that Allied Enterpriseshad purchased three boats in all: a yacht plus two schooners that they bought onmortgages exceeding $12,000. He tracked down the schooners but could find notrace of Ron or Betty.Several days later, a phone call from Howard Bond’s Yacht Harbor informedParsons that Ron and Betty’s yacht had sailed at 5 o’clock earlier thatafternoon. It was now 8 p.m. and he could do little about the situation. So heevoked Bartzabel, the spirit of Mars, to stop his dishonest partners. As if inresponse, a squall struck the yacht off the coast, tearing off its sails andforcing it back to port, where Parsons had them arrested. The Circuit Court ofDade County, Florida, slapped them with a restraining order that prevented theirselling the boats or leaving Miami until the courts settled the charges. At thistime, Jack wrote despondently to his “Dear Father” at Netherwood:Here I am in Miami pursuing the children of my folly. I have them well tied up.They cannot move without going to jail. However, most of the money has alreadybeen dissipated. I will be lucky to salvage $3,000 to $5,000.77[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts077]On July 11, Hubbard and Northrup agreed to a deal drawn up by Parsons’s lawyer:Jack got the yacht and one of the schooners. Ron and Betty kept the otherschooner, split his legal costs, and signed a promissory note of $2,900. Parsonsreturned to Pasadena, feeling fleeced but having salvaged as much as he possiblycould. Hubbard would later claim that he was working undercover for the FBI tobreak up an immoral secret society.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_087_r1.jpg]Jack Parsons (1914–1952). (photo credit 22.4)[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c22-fig004a]Lilliput magazine wanted Aleister Crowley to contribute an article to their Juneissue and sent their assistant editor, John Symonds (1914–2006), to meet withhim on Friday, May 3. Symonds was born on March 12, 1914, in Battersea, London,to a single mother, Lithuanian Jewish immigrant Lily Sapzells, who ran aboarding house in Margate. He was estranged from his father, architect andantiques expert Robert Wemyss Symonds, who had married and refused toacknowledge John as his son. Spending his spare time in the British Museumreading room, Symonds’s first job was as a journalist for the Picture Post,where he befriended Dylan Thomas and poet-novelist Stephen Spender, whom Crowleyhad met back in 1931. During the war he was exempted from military service andedited Lilliput magazine; in 1946 he completed his first novel, the gothicfantasy William Waste.78 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts078]Clifford Bax had encouraged him to visit Crowley, saying, “He will die soon andthen you would have lost your chance.” Symonds—living at 84 Boundary Road,Hampstead, the very house where Victor Neuburg had died in 1940—already had aninterest in AC. So he and astrologer Rupert Gleadow (1909–1974) journeyed toNetherwood. Crowley greeted them in the drawing room with his customary “Do whatthou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.” As Symonds and Gleadow checked himout, AC incited them by stating his disbelief in astrology. At one point, heexamined his small, bony arm and explained that he needed an injection ofheroin. “Do you mind?” he asked.“Not at all,” Symonds answered. “Can I help?”Smirking, Crowley related the squeamish reaction of a visiting army officer—mostlikely either McMurtry or Mellinger—when he went to the bathroom to injecthimself. “I left the bedroom door open, and from behind the bathroom door I bentdown to the keyhole and began to squeal like a stuck pig. When I came out, Ifound my poor friend had almost fainted.”79[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts079]Their visit ended with Crowley asking him, “Do you play chess?”“No,” answered Symonds. “I don’t, but I know how to.”“I wish I did,” he deadpanned. “I’ve been trying to learn for the last sixtyyears,” then presented each of them with a copy of the blue paper-covered Bookof the Law published by the Church of Thelema.Shortly thereafter, Lilliput received his story “The Young Man and the PostOffice” (printed as “How to Tell an Englishman from an American”).80[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts080]His publication plans forged ahead, with Lady Harris designing a cover for Olla,which was due out that summer. Crowley realized this plan was optimistic and,receiving the proofs on June 6, knew its publication date would be later thananticipated. He nevertheless proceeded with other projects. “My main object inthis revived burst of activity is to get my principal works publishedsomehow—anyhow—so as to have them in a definite form while I still encumber thisplanet,” Crowley explained to John Symonds,81[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts081] who had offered to helphowever he could. Although Symonds preferred Magick without Tears, AC wanted thelong-completed Liber Aleph to be his next book in print, with a Christmasrelease date every bit as tentative as that for Olla.82[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts082]His worsening eyesight, however, interrupted the Great Work. As far back asApril, he had complained to McMurtry, “My eyes are really bothering me so muchthat I feel totally unable to deal with your letter as I should like.”83[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts083] Glasses did not help. A Londonoptician, Dr. McGowan, diagnosed him with amblyopia or “lazy eye,” and insistedCrowley quit smoking “immediately and forever” in order to save his vision. Thatnoon, Crowley ceremonially renounced tobacco. Although optical and dentalproblems continued to plague Crowley, his vision had improved so much by July 20that he “Decided to risk half a pipe at 6 p.m. chiefly to make sure that thisdid not bring about an immediate relapse.”84[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts084] By September, Crowley happilynoted, “Eyes quite o.k. so far, despite moderate resumption of smoking.”85[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts085]When Augustus John did Crowley’s portrait that summer, it was the first time hehad seen the mage in decades. Frankly, the sight of his shrunken friend, withvacant eyes staring out of his wrinkled, gray head, frightened John; only hissharp mind retained its youthful vigor. “A glorious sketch!” Crowleycongratulated the artist, who offered to help Crowley by arranging forcollotyping by Chiswick Press himself.He gave the Olla proofs a final inspection, setting its publication date forDecember 22. He printed fifty prospectuses and on December 11 sold the firstcopy. On December 22, 1946, at 10:54 a.m., the moment of the winter solstice,Olla: An Anthology of Sixty Years of Song was officially published in an editionof five hundred copies. The book listed Symonds’s 121 Adelaide Road address asOTO’s place of publication. “I think of it as a unique publication,” Crowleyremarked. “I doubt whether anyone else can boast—if it is a boast—of 60 years ofsong.”86 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts086] The Occult Reviewconcurred, devoting four pages to reviewing what would be the last book he wouldpublish. In his review, Nicholas Sylvester introduced Crowley as “one of theforemost, as well as one of the most logical, investigators in the field” ofmagic, and said of Olla, “This collection of poems is the work of a greatoccultist and a great poet,” predicting “it may well prove that he will beremembered in the future as a poet of outstanding genius and ability.”87[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts087]Crowley continued making regular payments to his Hastings printer, who promisedto have page proofs of Liber Aleph ready by the end of May.When James Laver (1899–1975)—art historian, museum curator, and author of bookson many subjects, including a recent one on the prophet Nostradamus88[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts088]—accepted Crowley’s invitationand visited him at Netherwood on March 27, he found the Mage sickly. He was on aspecial diet and left his boiled egg uneaten in favor of brandy and perique.Blood dotted his shirt sleeves, and only an injection of heroin cleared his dulleyes and perked him up. During their conversations on magick, Crowley made theinsightful comment, “Ah, you realize that magick is something we do toourselves. But it is more convenient to assume the objective existence of anangel who gives us new knowledge than to allege that our invocation has awakeneda supernormal power in ourselves.”89[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts089] In his diary, Crowley recordedthe day, “Most delightful interview, A.C. at his best.”90[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts090]Arnold Crowther (1909–1974) was another in the carnival of visitors who—in thetradition of Symonds, Butler, and Laver—came to Netherwood to see the quicklydecaying mage, Aleister Crowley. Crowther was neither a disciple nor detractor;and, although he was a magician, it was not in the same manner as the Beast. Hismagic was sleight of hand, and he only knew of Crowley through the media and adiscarded copy of Magick in Theory and Practice that had been given to himduring one of his World War II performances for the army. He was also aventriloquist, puppeteer, and puppet-maker who entertained the like of PrincessElizabeth and Princess Margaret at Buckingham Palace.91[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts091] When, after one of his shows,someone asked him, “Are you that awful man?,” he realized the similarity betweenthe names Arnold Crowther and Aleister Crowley. His curiosity piqued, hearranged to visit on May 1. He brought with him his friend Gerald BrousseauGardner (1884–1964), a retired civil servant fascinated by magic and witchcraft.In later years, Crowther would become inolved in Gardner’s revival of paganism.Gardner was born near Liverpool to a middle-class family, proprietors of theUnited Kingdom’s oldest hardwood importers, Joseph Gardner & Sons. He spent muchof his life living abroad in exotic locations like the Canary Islands, Ceylon,Borneo, and Malaya. The cultures to which he was exposed—particularly theirmagical practices and their weaponry—fascinated him. Becoming an amateuranthropologist, he published a book on Keris and Other Malay Weapons in 1936.92[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts092] That same year, at agefifty-two, he retired and settled back in England. Here, he joined the FolkoreSociety and contributed to its journal, and also became involved in groups basedon Rosicrucianism and witchcraft.93[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts093]May 1, 1947, was the first of four visits for Gardner, who got along well withCrowley. Beast admitted him into OTO as Brother Scire (“To know”), advancing himto VII° and authorizing him to get OTO going again in England. “We are getting aCamp of Minerval started during the summer if plans go as at present arranged,”Crowley reported excitedly to Germer.94[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts094] Alas, Gardner never used hischarter, explaining, “I tried to start an order, but I got ill and had to leavethe country.”95 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts095]Two years later, Gardner would publish the novel High Magic’s Aid throughAtlantis Bookshop. Since the eighteenth-century Witchcraft Act made the practiceof witchcraft illegal, the title page bore as a pseudonym a garbled version ofGardner’s OTO motto: Scire O.T.O. 4°=7°. Although it was a novel, itsdescription of a witch cult intrigued his readers. “A.C. read part of the MS,and highly approved,” Gardner reported. “He wanted me to put the witch part infull.”96 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts096] The book was, infact, a springboard for introducing witchcraft to the world. Gardner, accordingto apocryphal reports, had paid Crowley $1,500, or £300, to write a pagangrimoire—the Book of Shadows—for his witchcraft revival;97[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts097] however, no record of such anarrangement exists in Crowley’s letters or diaries. The truth, according tolong-time friend and student Doreen Valiente, is that Gardner borrowed liberallyfrom various works, including Leland’s Gospel of the Witches98[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts098] and the works of his friendAC.99 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts099]Gardnerian witchcraft, particularly its early forms, clearly draws heavily fromCrowley. The symbolic great rite comes from OTO’s VI° ritual; the pagancatchphrase “Perfect love and perfect trust” is drawn from “The Revival ofMagick,” and the Wiccan III° initiation—the highest in the Craft—is essentiallya Gnostic Mass. And, for all its evocative beauty, the Charge of the Goddess islargely a paraphrase of The Book of the Law. Even Gardner himself, in a cageyway, admits the lineage of his witchcraft movement: in his second book,Witchcraft Today, he writes:The great question which people ask is: “How do you know the cult is old?”… Theonly man I can think of who could have invented the rites was the late AleisterCrowley. When I met him he was most interested to hear that I was a member, andsaid he had been inside when he was very young, but would not say whether he hadrewritten anything or not.… There are indeed certain expressions and certainwords which smack of Crowley.100[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts100]Gardner’s relationship with Crowley has become quite a fish story over theyears, but the simplest account is still the accepted truth: Gardner met Crowleythrough Arnold Crowther; they met four times in all; Crowley gave Gardnerauthority, which he valued but never used, to operate an OTO body; and Gardnerwas so impressed with Crowley’s writings that he borrowed sections whendeveloping the rituals for his coven.101[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts101]“A miracle has just happened,” AC wrote excitedly to E. N. Fitzgerald. “The girlPat and Aleister Ataturk, who I had long since given up for dead, are in London.She phoned me last night. I am delirious with joy. They come here Thursday.”102[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts102] Pat and Aleister Ataturk, whojust turned ten on May 2, came out from Cornwall to visit Crowley for three daysin the middle of May. The visit pleased AC, who, old and lonely, missed hisfamily. He was so happy to see them that on May 22 Crowley instructed members ofOTO to ensure Ataturk’s care and education after his father died. He also seizedthe opportunity to write his son a fatherly letter while he still had thechance. His advice provides great insight into Crowley’s mind, and is quoted infull:Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.My dear son,This is the first letter that your father has ever written to you, so you canimagine that it will be very important, and you should keep it and lay it byyour heart.First of all, let me tell you how intensely happy your reappearance has made me.I feel that I must devote a great deal of my time to watching over your career.I was very pleased to hear that you had decided to learn to read, and that, ofcourse, means learning to write. A word of warning about this. In these lastyears, children have been taught to write script, as they call it, which is avery bad thing. You must write in such a way that it impresses your personalityon the reader.On top of that, I wanted to tell you something about yourself. One of yourAncestors was Duke of a place called La Querouaille in Brittany, and he cameover to England with the Duke of Richmond, who was the original heir to theEnglish throne, to help him turn out the usurper, known to history as RichardIII. Since then, our family has made its mark on the world on several occasions,though never anything very brilliant. Now, I want you to take this veryseriously. I want you to be very proud of yourself for belonging to such afamily. Owing to the French Revolution and various other catastrophes, theDukedom is no longer in existence legally, but morally it is so, and I want youto learn to behave as a Duke would behave. You must be high-minded, generous,noble, and, above all, without fear. For that last reason, you must never tell alie, for to do so shows that you are afraid of the person to whom you tell it,and I want you to be afraid of nobody. I think that is all about now.Now with regard to your education. I want particularly to insist on learningLatin, and I will give you my reasons. Firstly, anyone who knows Latin gains agreater command of and understanding of the English language than he wouldotherwise possess. He will be able to reason out for himself the meanings ofwords with which he is unfamiliar. Secondly, if you are well-grounded in Latin,you are halfway to a knowledge of French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese, forall these languages, as well as English, are derived from Latin. Thirdly, themost important of all, much of the unconscious part of your mind has been formedby the writing of Latin and Greek authors. This implies that you should alsolearn a certain amount of Greek. One of the wisest men of olden time gave thisinstruction to his pupils: “Know thyself,” and learning Latin helps you to dothis for the reason I have already explained above. I regard this as veryimportant indeed. There are a great many people going about today who tell youthat Latin is no use to you in the ordinary affairs of life, and that is quitetrue if you are going to be some commonplace person like a tradesman or a bankclerk. But you are a gentleman, and if you want to be an educated gentlemen, youmust know Latin.There is another matter that I want to put before you. It will be a very goodplan if you learn to play chess. For one thing, it is a very good training forthe mind, and, for another, it is the only game, of all the games worth playing,which lasts you throughout your life. You can get as much pleasure out of itwhen you are 60 as when you are 20.I think that is all I have to say to you today, and I shall expect you to managesomehow to write me an answer. You see, much of the time we shall not be able tocommunicate face to face, and there will be a good many questions that you willwant to ask me, which you cannot do unless you write good English.That reminds me. There is one more point that I want to impress to you. The bestmodels of English writings are Shakespeare and the Old Testament, especially theBook of Job, the Psalms and Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Solomon. Itwill be a very good thing for you to commit as much as you can both of thesebooks and of the best plays of Shakespeare to memory, so that they form thefoundation of your style. In writing English, the most important quality thatyou can acquire is style. That makes all the difference to anyone who reads whatyou write, whether you use the best phrases in the best way. You will have todevote some time to grammar and syntax, and also to logic. Logic is the scienceand the art of using words, and it teaches you to think correctly without makingblunders in reasoning, which nowadays everyone is liable to do just because theyhave not got the training which I am proposing to give you.Now, my dear son, I will close this long letter in the eager hope you willfollow my advice in all respects.Love is the law, love under will.Your affectionate father.103 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts103]Also visiting that summer was Harvard scholar Richard David Ellmann (1918–1987),who had a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to write a biography of Yeats.Born in Highland Park, Michigan, to Jewish Romanian immigrant James IsaacEllmann and Ukrainian immigrant Jeantte Barsook, Ellman graduated from YaleUniversity with exceptional distinction in English and received his MA in 1941.His position as an instructor at Harvard was interrupted by the United States’sentry into the war and his army enlistment. In 1945 he found himself in Londonwith the Office of Strategic Services, where that September he met W. B. Yeats’swidow. Impressed with Ellmann’s knowledge of Yeats, she granted him access toher archive. Thus he began writing what would be Yale University’s firstdoctoral dissertation on a twentieth-century writer.104[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts104] Clifford Bax had passed AC’saddress along to Ellmann, who wished to interview Crowley about his “magicalwar” with Yeats in the GD days. The result of this interview was a colorfularticle titled, “Black Magic against White: Aleister Crowley versus W. B.Yeats.”105 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts105]As his health deteriorated, AC had difficulty making more than an occasionaldiary entry or remembering names and dates. Reuss’s advice echoed in his mind,“Trust not a stranger: fail not of an heir.” He had already hastily awarded IX°honors to several students, ensuring the secret would survive his death. Now hewrote to McMurtry:It seems a long time since I heard from you. This is a great mistake: I willtell you why in strict confidence. In the event of my death Frater Saturnus isof course my successor, but after his death the terrible burden ofresponsibility might very easily fall upon your shoulders; for this reason Ishould like you to keep closely in touch with me.I am sending you a bound copy of “Olla” to remind you of me.…106[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts106]Shortly thereafter, he wrote similarly to Frederick Mellinger (1890–1970):Any time you can spare a moment think of me, and remember that you can bring nogreater happiness into my life than by dropping me a brief note: never mindwhether there is anything to say or not.I am very anxious indeed that you should keep in close touch with me, if onlybecause I think it quite possible that after Frater Saturnus and myself havemoved on into the next stage, you may find yourself saddled with the wholeresponsibility of carrying on the work of the Order. It is most important thatyou should have paid the greatest attention to practiced experience of everyside of the work, because whenever you become the supreme head of everything youwill find that people write to you from everywhere and anywhere asking all sortsof the most impossible questions, and you have to answer them not merely withtact and discretion, but with detailed knowledge.Please remember this above all things … you never know at what moment you mayfind yourself in a position of supreme responsibility, and you must not shirk itor dodge it.…107 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts107]Mellinger was an actor in both his German homeland and in the United States, towhich he emigrated as a Jewish refugee. He had a long-standing interest in theoccult, publishing in 1933 while still in Germany Zeichen und Wunder: Ein Führerdurch die Welt der Magie (Signs and Wonders: A Guide to the World of Magic).108[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts108] He became a U.S. citizen inthe mid-to-late 1930s and traveled to Europe on occasional military assignments.Living in Los Angeles he had various bit parts in Hollywood films109[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts109] and in 1940 met W. T. Smith.They became instant friends, and Mellinger joined both OTO and theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]under Smith’s sponsorship. In 1945, with Germer’s financial help, he returned toGermany and visited Crowley at Hastings. Judging from the above-quoted letter,he certainly made an impression. However, in the years following Crowley’sdeath, he would remain on the periphery of the Thelemic circle.Although it may appear that Crowley was willing to give the IX° to anyone, hehad a definite plan in mind. He described it to Germer:You seem in doubt too about the succession. There has never been any questionabout this. Since your re-appearance you are the only successor of whom I haveever thought since that moment. I have, however, had the idea that in view ofthe dispersion of so many members, you might find it useful to appoint atriumvirate to work under you. My idea was Mellinger, MacMurtrie [sic] and, Isuppose, Roy.… I shall leave it entirely to you to decide about your triumvirateafter my death.110 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts110]After writing his letter to McMurtry, Crowley prepared his last will andtestament. Then, before he even finished correcting the proofs of Liber Alephthat August, he added Golden Twigs to the print queue.[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_088_r1.jpg]Karl Johannes Germer (1885–1962), Crowley’s successor in OTO. (photo credit22.5) [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_app1_r1.htm#c22-fig005a]As AC grew progressively ill that summer, the Netherwood housekeepers prayed forhis own sake that he would die soon. Karl planned to come to Hastings thatautumn to care for Crowley, but British authorities denied him a visa. Thus,when Lady Harris found Crowley dirty and neglected, she asked him if he had anymoney for a trained nurse. “I have over £400 in banknotes in the strongbox undermy bed,” he explained, “but that’s not for my personal use. It’s money fromAmerica, earmarked for the order.” Especially now, when publishing his works wasso important, Crowley refused to dip into his publication fund. So, thatSeptember, Frieda hired a nurse herself. In addition, Mr. H. Watson of the RidgeStores also helped look after him.When Crowley turned seventy-two in October, his grip on life was slipping. “Ihave myself been very ill, confined to bed for six months or more,” he wrote.111[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts111] Wilkinson noticed the lightfading in his eyes. Laying pathetically helpless in bed, he reflecteddespondently on his life and realized he hadn’t obtained the recognition he felthe deserved; he hadn’t completed the Great Work he had set out to accomplish. Hewas only a front-page sensation for the newspapers to trot out whenevercirculation slipped. Even now, he insisted that reporters were hiding in thebushes, waiting for him to die. With a sigh, he remarked, “This is a good worldto leave.”Louis replied, “Don’t talk that way.”“You are my greatest friend, Louis.” Crowley smiled sadly. “I’m sorry you havewasted your time visiting a log.” Those were his last words to his oldestfriend.On the anniversary of his GD initiation, Crowley sent a cable to Karl:GERMER:PERDURABO BORN 49 YEARS AGO. THERION SENDS DEEPEST LOVE HIGHEST BLESSINGYOURSELVES AND THELEMITES, THE UNIVERSE.To Frieda, Louis, and Karl—the ones who really mattered—Crowley had said hispiece and given his farewells.His condition became so severe that Pat and her children, including Ataturk,came to his side on the last day of November. Frederick Mellinger and his wifealso made the journey, finding Crowley disoriented and unsure of where he was.When he finally passed, the stillness of the day was interrupted by a peal ofthunder and a gust of wind that blew the curtains across the room. “It was thegods greeting him,” recalled Deirdre.On Monday, December 1, 1947, at 11 a.m., Aleister Crowley died of myocardialdegeneration and chronic bronchitis. In his pocket was an Abramelin talisman“for a great treasure” and an old letter, tattered from repeated unfoldings andfoldings. Dated September 10, 1939, it read: “The Director of Naval Intelligencepresents his compliments and would be glad if you could find it convenient tocall at the Admiralty for an interview.”Wilkinson took the phone call at Netherwood, where he was staying to arrangeCrowley’s funeral. Lifting the receiver to his ear, he greeted, “Hello,” thenfirmly replied, “I’m sorry, but the funeral is a private affair.” Since hisdeath, everyone was calling for details of the evil Aleister Crowley’s demise;Wilkinson grew intolerant of the reporters, remembering how his friend, shortlybefore death, believed they were waiting outside his window for him to die. Howright he was. The newspapers said it all in their headlines:Black Magician Crowley Dies: “Wickedest Man in Britain.”World’s Worst Man Dies.Awful Aleister.Rascal’s Regress.Aleister Crowley Dies; Once the “Invisible” Man.Mystic’s Potion to Prolong Life Fails.“Worst Man in the World” Dies, Leaves Weird Pictures.112[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts112]Crowley gained no respect while living and received even less in death. When itwas discoverd that his attending physician, William Brown Thomson (c.1889–1947), of 12 Park Way in Greenford, died within twenty-four hours of hispatient,113 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts113] rumors of a cursefueled further headlines, like “Crowley’s Doctor Dies: ‘Curse Put on Him.’ ”114[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts114] The fact that Thomson wasfifty-eight years old did nothing to deflect conspiracy theories of postmortemrevenge.Crowley’s will named Frieda Harris, Louis Wilkinson, and Karl Germer as hisexecutors, charged with settling his debts. Revoking all previous bequests, heleft his copyrights to OTO, which was to ensure Pat and Ataturk’s care. He namedWilkinson and Symonds his literary executors, charging them to collect hisliterary remains and ship them to Germer in New York. He asked that no religiousservice be performed at his funeral, wishing instead for Yorke or Wilkinson toread selections from his works.Friday afternoon of December 5 was cold and dank. Mourners and spectatorsgathered inside the chapel at the Brighton cemetery where, at 2:45, Crowley’sflower-covered coffin was solemnly brought.Carrying a copy of The Book of the Law and Magick, Louis Wilkinson took therostrum and looked out at the group of fifteen mourners, including, according tothe press, “five well-dressed women and six youths in need of haircuts.”115[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts115] Among those he recognized wereGerald Yorke, Frieda Harris, John Symonds, J. G. Bayley, Pat and AleisterMacAlpine, and Kenneth Grant and his wife, Steffi. Yorke counted threereporters.Wilkinson, tall and dignified, began without hesitation. “Do what thou wiltshall be the whole of the Law.” Deep and articulate, his voice filled the chapelas he read “Hymn to Pan,” excerpts from The Book of the Law, the Collects fromthe Gnostic Mass, and the “Quia Patris” from “The Ship,” which Crowley had readat Raoul Loveday’s funeral:Thou who art I, beyond all I am,Who has no nature, and no name,Who art, when all but thou are gone,Thou, centre and secret of the Sun,Thou, hidden spring of all things knownAnd unknown, Thou aloof, alone,Thou, the true fire within the reedBrooding and breeding, source and seedOf life, love, liberty and light,Thou beyond speech and beyond sight,Thee I invoke, my faint fresh fireKindling as mine intents aspire.Thee I invoke, abiding one,Thee, centre and secret of the Sun,And that most holy mysteryOf which the vehicle am I!Appear, most awful and most mild,As it is lawful, to thy child!For of the Father and the SonThe Holy Spirit is the norm:Male-female, quintessential, one,Man-being veiled in Woman-form.Glory and worship in the Highest,Thou Dove, mankind that deifiest,Being that race—most royally runTo spring sunshine through winter storm!Glory and worship be to Thee,Sap of the world-ash, wonder tree!Glory to Thee from gilded tomb!Glory to Thee from waiting womb!Glory to thee from virgin vowed!Glory to Thee from Earth unploughed!Glory to Thee, true UnityOf the eternal Trinity!Glory to Thee, thou sire and damAnd Self of I am that I am.Glory to Thee, beyond all term,Thy spring of sperm, thy seed and germ!Glory to Thee, eternal Sun,Thou One in Three, Thou Three in One!Glory and worship be to Thee,Sap of the world-ash, wonder-tree!Mourners’ ecstatic or tearful interjections of “Io Pan!” and “Do what thou wiltshall be the whole of the Law” punctuated the recital. The reporters just lookedat each other, nonplussed.Wilkinson closed the book and solemnly ended with “Love is the law, love underwill.” He sat down, and Pat threw a spray of roses on the coffin. Rollersturned, and the coffin entered the furnace.116[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#c22-nts116]Reporters formed a gauntlet around mourners as they left the chapel, barking outquestions and jotting down quotes to include in the next edition of theirtabloids. “Beware what you write,” Symonds said, locking eyes with one reporter.“Crowley may strike at you from wherever he is.” The heavens released adownpour, and Wilkinson, riding back to Hastings, remarked of the weather, “Justwhat Crowley would have liked.”Unable to fathom the meaning of the funeral, reporters described Crowley’s lastrites as a Black Mass, running headlines likeCremating “Great Beast”Desecrated by Black MagicThe scandalized Brighton Town Council met to discuss this spectacle and assuredthe public that such a thing would never happen again.They were right."},{"pageContent":"EPILOGUEHe was wasted in England. In Persia or India or Japan, millions would havefollowed him.—Andrew Green1 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#epl-nts001]His poetry undoubtedly ranks among the finest ever written.—Hereward Carrington2 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#epl-nts002]Crowley’s story after death was as colorful as it was in life.Karl Germer accepted Crowley’s nomination as Outer Head of the Order and tookover OTO business. With the help of Yorke and Harris he sought high-rankingBritish members to identify the new X° for Ireland, Iona, and all the Britains.Symonds, whose address appeared in Olla as the order’s, acted as anadministrative assistant to Germer but was not actually an OTO member. E. N.Fitzgerald had received the IX° from Crowley, but according to Germer, “He doesnot however know what it is about.”3[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#epl-nts003] Therefore the nodwent—briefly—to Gerald Gardner, who had been chartered by Crowley to operate anOTO camp. But Gardner reported, “owing to ill health I so far haven’t been ableto get anything going. I’ve had some people interested, but some of them weresent to Germany with the army of occupation, and others lived far away, and sonothing happened.”4 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#epl-nts004] Andnothing ever would. Agape Lodge remained the only active OTO body under Germer.Since he never performed nor liked rituals, and discouraged the lodges frominitiating new members, Agape struggled to endure. Germer instead focused onseeing Liber Aleph and Golden Twigs, which were in press at the time ofCrowley’s death, to publication. The difficulty of conducting transatlanticbusiness forced him to abandon the projects by November 1948.Yorke pleaded with Germer, “Please do not send me Power of Attorney to act onyour behalf.… It would not be honest for me having refused to have officialbusiness relations with him [Crowley] since at least 1932 to take them up afterhis death.”5 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#epl-nts005] Yorke, however,did spend his life keeping his vow to preserve Crowley’s papers, oftenpurchasing them from creditors, forgotten storage facilities, solicitors,auction houses, and acquaintances. These materials he readily shared withGermer, who, possessing the bulk of Crowley’s papers, lent material to Yorke tocopy. Both men believed that only a later generation would understand andappreciate Crowley’s literary legacy, and they hoped someday to store archivalcopies of all his papers on each continent. Yorke’s collection is currently keptat the Warburg Institute, part of the postgraduate School for Advanced Studiesat the University of London, and is the world’s largest public archive ofCrowleyana.Frieda Harris, meanwhile, published a booklet commemorating Crowley’s funeral.Titled The Last Ritual, it contained the text of his funeral and boasted anoriginal cover by Harris; she asked for a contribution of $1 per copy to defrayprinting costs. One year after his death she carried out another of Crowley’slast wishes by arranging a curry party in his honor. Held at 7:30 p.m. onDecember 1, the dinner party attracted about fourteen of AC’s acquaintances, whoretired afterward to Yorke’s home for the evening.Not all of Crowley’s acquaintances remained so loyal, however.“Now that Crowley is safely dead, do you think his story can be told?” JohnSymonds voiced the question which typified the unfortunately common reaction toCrowley’s death. Symonds went on to write The Great Beast (1951), a sensationaland critical portrayal of Crowley’s life. At least one publisher turned the bookdown for fear of libel, but London publishers Rider eventually bought it. Thoseloyal to AC saw it as a betrayal of trust, and Yorke’s catalog of the book’sinaccuracies is a lengthy and damning document. Nevertheless, the book remainedthe primary source of information on Crowley throughout the second half of thetwentieth century; ironically, its sensational tone may well have contributed toCrowley’s enduring propularity.Longtime student and friend J. G. Bayley pulled an equally remarkableabout-face. Although he had joined theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]in 1910, visited Crowley regularly in his last years, and paid his respects atthe funeral, he wrote Germer a surprising letter two years after Crowley’sdeath:Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Thanks for your letter of the 13th ulto. I don’t want to engage in any longrigmarole about Crowley.… I could go on reeling off dozens of other people whohad despicable, abominable, criminal tricks played on them by that scoundrel.Love is the law, love under will.Yours Fraternally,L.O.V.6 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#epl-nts006]Particularly ironic is the bracketing of his condemnation with Thelemicsalutations and hisA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]motto.In 1942, C. S. Jones—the once-beloved Frater Achad—was teaching kabbalah andmagick to Under the Volcano (1947) author Malcolm Lowry (1909–1957). Jonessought to mend his fences with Crowley, who saw no way his erstwhile magical soncould compensate for what he regarded as twenty years of egoism and insanity.Thus Jones sought to build his own magical universe on the ashes of his formermaster. On April 8, 1948—four months after Crowley’s death, and forty-four yearsto the day after Crowley received The Book of the Law—“An Open Letter fromFrater Achad” announced that the 2,160-year reign of the Aeon of Horus had endedprematurely, replaced by the Aeon of Maat, the daughter, of which Achad was thechosen prophet.7 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#epl-nts007] Despite hislifelong love of Thelema and ceremonial magic, Jones reportedly embracedCatholicism on his deathbed.8 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#epl-nts008]As Agape Lodge fell into abeyance, Jack Parsons sold his mansion to a developer,took the Oath of the Abyss in 1949, and wrote to Germer in mid-1952:No doubt you will be delighted to hear from an adept who has undertaken theoperation of his H.G.A. in accord with our traditions.The operation began auspiciously with a chromatic display of psychosomaticsymptoms, and progressed rapidly to acute psychosis. The operator has alternatedsatisfactorily between manic hysteria and depressing melancholy stupor onapproximately 40 cycles, and satisfactory progress has been maintained in socialostracism, economic collapses and mental disassociation.9[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#epl-nts009]On Friday, June 20, 1952, Parsons was working alone in his coach-houselaboratory when, at 5:08 p.m., an explosion blew out the doors and walls of thestable, reducing the building to rubble. The police soon found Ruth VirginiaParsons at the home of an invalid friend, notifying her of her son’s death.After the officers left, Mrs. Parsons sat down and swallowed a bottle ofsleeping pills, her handicapped friend helpless to do anything but watch whileMrs. Parsons slipped into death.An inquest later determined that, as experienced as Parsons was in handlingexplosives, it was an accident. The press later reported evidence to thecontrary, but authorities never followed up; thus it is the belief of many, hiswidow Cameron included, that he was murdered.10[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#epl-nts010] Given the way Parsons died, apassage from his Book of Babalon sounds eerily prophetic:And in that day my work will be accomplished, and I shall be blown away upon theBreath of the Father, even as it is prophesied. And thus I labour lonely andoutcast and abominable, an he-goat upon the muck heaps of the world.…Meanwhile in England, Kenneth Grant had continued to study Crowley’s doctrines,and applied for a charter to operate the first three degrees of OTO. Germergranted this until 1955, when Grant announced the formation of the New IsisLodge of OTO. He claimed to have contacted an intelligence from atrans-Plutonian planet and received secret instructions to reorganize OTO;instructions that were secret, Grant claimed, even to the OHO. Germer repudiatedthe manifesto and, when Grant persisted in this direction, expelled him on July20, 1955:NOTIFICATION OF EXPULSIONDo what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.You are notified that the very small and limited authority I gave you at onetime to establish a Camp of O.T.O. in the valley of London is withdrawn, and Iformally expel you from membership in the Ordo Templi Orientis.Love is the law, love under will.SaturnusKarl Germer X° and FraterSuperior of O.T.O.11 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#epl-nts011]Undeterred, Grant continued working his version of magick, drawing not only fromCrowley but also from Eastern tantra and the work of his friend, artist AustinSpare.12 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#epl-nts012] He also published aseries of articles, monographs, and books on these subjects from the 1950s untilthe present day.13 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#epl-nts013]Germer had one other student worth mentioning, the Brazilian Marcelo Ramos Motta(1931–1987). Germer admitted him into OTO andA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg],and together they published Crowley’s Liber Aleph (1961). Although Germer hadreleased Magick without Tears in mimeographed form seven years earlier, LiberAleph represented a fine typeset edition of one of Crowley’s masterpieces.Germer died shortly thereafter in 1962. He named no successor, and his widownotified few of his passing, leaving OTO leaderless.Fortunately, the late 1960s era of flower power, psychedelics, free love andTranscendental Meditation made Crowley fashionable. He appeared on the Beatles’Sergeant Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967) album cover and in the pages ofRobert Heinlein’s science fiction classic Stranger in a Strange Land (1961), andquickly became a pop-culture icon. Regrettably, Crowley’s popularity alsoattracted the attention of some ignoble peers. When Anton LaVey founded hisChurch of Satan in 1966, he cited Crowley as an influence; thus, even though ACrejected Satanists and black magicians, the media again categorized him as both.Similarly, after a group of admirers known as the Solar Lodge locked one oftheir boys, Anthony Gibbons, in a wooden box in the Southern Californiadesert—his punishment for playing with matches and burning down theircompound—the press linked Crowley’s name to the incident.14[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#epl-nts014]McMurtry had been out of touch with his fellow Agape Lodge members, but when helearned of Germer’s death and the sad state of OTO, he knew something needed tobe done. Remembering that Crowley had named him Caliph and had given himauthority to assume control or restart OTO in an emergency, McMurtry declaredthe situation an emergency and resuscitated the order. He gathered the survivingmembers of Agape Lodge to legally incorporate OTO in the 1970s and quicklyestablished initiations, lodges, and camps worldwide.15[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#epl-nts015]Because of the unresolved issue of Germer’s OTO successor, two other peopleclaimed the mantle of OHO. Kenneth Grant, despite his expulsion from OTO in1955, began calling himself the OHO when he and Symonds coedited The Confessionsof Aleister Crowley (1969). He argued control not by succession but by virtue ofhaving that magical spark of inspiration that he believed Germer lacked. Much asCrowley had claimed that Mathers had lost contact with the Secret Chiefs, so didGrant claim that heirship of Thelema had passed over Germer to him. Of all OHOcontenders, he made the greatest effort to expand and build upon Crowley’s workrather than confine himself to the letter of the law. During the 1970s he wasone of a handful of people editing material by Crowley and Austin Spare, and hewas practically alone in offering new contributions to the literature of magick.While his system differs considerably from Crowley’s, he gets high marks fororiginality. Indeed, Henrik Bogdan called him “the perhaps most original andprolific author of the post-modern occultist genre,” while Martin P. Starrdescribed Grant’s work as “fashioned out of the stuff of dreams.”16[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#epl-nts016] However, his manner ofexegesis—relying on complex numerologies, webs of symbolism, and codedlanguage—is difficult for the beginner, and his later books are progressivelymore bizarre.17 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#epl-nts017] His worksnevertheless remain in demand.Motta, learning of Germer’s death, believed it appropriate to single-handedlyorganize a convocation of IX° members to elect a new OHO. His dedication to thetask came off as belligerence, however, and he quickly alienated the AmericanOTO members who were closest to Germer. When this happened, Motta proclaimedhimself OHO, convinced he was entitled to a percentage of Crowley’s book sales.He began publishing volume five of The Equinox, in its pages attacking everyonewho ever published or wrote anything about Crowley. His position becameincreasingly extreme and his opinions so vehement that he alienated most of hisfollowers, and his organization, the Society Ordo Templi Orientis, dwindled insize by 1984 to four members.A 1985 lawsuit between McMurtry and Motta resulted in the OTO headed byMcMurtry—descended from the only chartered organization in operation atCrowley’s death and throughout Germer’s reign—being recognized as owner ofCrowley’s copyrights. (A similar ruling was made in the United Kingdom in 2002.)McMurtry died shortly before the 1985 ruling—and Motta shortly thereafter—andthe remaining members of OTO met to elect the next Caliph and OHO, perMcMurtry’s wishes. Over the years, OTO has made great strides in preserving andpublishing authoritative versions of Crowley’s existing works, many of whichhave been out of print or unpublished, and have amassed a sizable archive basedon Germer’s surviving papers. It has also won several libel cases, demonstratingthat it would not tolerate the abuse that typified Crowley’s life. Today theorganization claims over three thousand members worldwide.Aleister Crowley stands as one of the most remarkable and innovative figures ofhis century: a man of fervent belief, he devoted his life and squandered hisfortune seeking a glimpse of spiritual truth and sharing that vision with anyonewilling to listen. Tragically, he spent his last years discredited,impoverished, and far from his family and friends in London. Yet he wasultimately successful in a way few people are: despite adverse or indifferentresponses to his message, Crowley never doubted the correctness of his vision orhis role as its advocate. Thus he lived every moment of his life based on hisconvictions regardless of their personal cost, whether to his fortune,friendships, or reputation. The best summation of the man may be by Crowleyhimself:I wish therefore that you would realize that my universe is very much largerthan yours.… Some time ago I thought of writing a book on internationally famouspeople with whom I had been intimate. The number ran to over 80. Am I wrong tosuppose that you never met such people?Take another point: have you visited the monuments of antiquity; have you seenthe majority of the great paintings and sculptures? Have you discussed all sortsof intimate matters with natives of every civilized quarter of the globe?Perhaps more than any of the above in importance, have you made your way alonein parts of the earth never before trodden by any human foot—perhaps in hostileand nearly always inhospitable country? You may think it pompous of me tomention these matters, but the fact is that they don’t matter unless you thinkthey don’t matter.The point that I am trying to get you to realize is that any statement or actionof mine is enormously modified by my having had these experiences.18[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#epl-nts018]Perhaps immodest, the contentions in this letter are nevertheless accurate.Crowley’s substantive merit bears explanation, as much of what made himinnovative actually anticipated many things that are commonplace today. Theemphasis here will be on magick for two reasons: first, Crowley’s otheraccomplishments have been discussed earlier in this text. Also, magick is theavenue through which most people first encounter Crowley.As a practical system, magick introduced many innovations to the Masonic andRosicrucian traditions from which Crowley borrowed. Most notable is itssyncretic quality. While magical traditions have often been eclectic (see Pike’sMorals and Dogma [1871] or Blavatsky’s Isis Unveiled [1877] for examples),19[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#epl-nts019] Crowley was much broader andmore systematic.Consider the Eastern mystical traditions of Hinduism, Buddhism, andConfucianism. Crowley’s magical alma mater, the GD, offered only minor nodstoward these paths: its technique of moon breathing was borrowed from the hathayoga practice of pranayama and the belief in the body’s subtle energy channels,or nadis. Likewise, the system of tattva visions is adapted from the Hindusystem of five elements (tattvas). The likely source for both teachings isPrasad’s book Nature’s Finer Forces,20[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#epl-nts020] which was very influential onthe GD founders. After the 1900 disintegration of the London temple, Crowley’sown travels to the East gave him a far better grasp of the indigenous spiritualtraditions of India and China. By the time The Equinox I(4) (1910) and the firstpart of Book Four (1911) appeared, Crowley had seamlessly integrated a broadrange of yogic, divinatory, and meditative techniques into his teachings. Toappreciate how innovative this was, note that Legge’s translation of the I Chingfirst appeared in 1882,21 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#epl-nts021] andwhen Allan Bennett returned to London in 1908 as the Buddhist monk AnandaMetteya, he was considered the first Buddhist missionary to England.Crowley’s syncretism didn’t end with Eastern mysticism. A glance at therecommended reading list from “One Star in Sight” reveals the extent to which heintegrated disparate perspectives. It covers classics of Hinduism (Upanishads,Bhagavad-Gita, Hathayoga Pradipika), Buddhism (Dhammapada), Taoism (Tao TehKing), gnosticism (Pistis Sophia, The Divine Pymander), Zoroastrianism (TheOracles of Zoroaster), Pythagoreanism (The Golden Verses of Pythagoras),Christian mysticism (The Spiritual Guide of Molinos), Jewish mysticism (KabbalaDenudata), alchemy (Scrutinium Chymicum), mythology (The Golden Ass), psychology(Varieties of Religious Experience), and anthropology (The Golden Bough). Nordid he shun the rationalism of the great philosophers, encouraging students tostudy the likes of George Bishop Berkeley (1685–1753), David Hume (1711–1776),and Immanuel Kant (1724–1804).The crowning achievement of this cross-cultural approach is the correspondencescollected in 777 (1909). Although built on the notes of his GD mentors Mathersand Bennett, Crowley expanded the contents considerably. Similarly, Crowley’ssummation of his lifelong study in a new interpretation of the tarot resulted ina deck that remains unchallenged as the deepest ever produced. In laying out theparallels between all systems of symbolism, Crowley prefigured the structuralismof Claude Lévi-Strauss (1908–2009)22[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#epl-nts022] and Joseph Campbell’s(1904–1987) elaboration of the myth cycle of the hero.23[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#epl-nts023] He also anticipated theeclecticism that is part and parcel of the so-called New Age or alternativereligion movement, in which as much as ten percent of the populationparticipates.24 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#epl-nts024]Given the quantity of information available today on the world’s esoterictraditions, Crowley’s reading list does show its age. At its time, however, itwas so innovative as to invite ridicule—which the yellow press obliginglysupplied. Indeed, subsequent secret societies (such as Dion Fortune’s Fraternityof the Inner Light and W. E. Butler’s Servants of the Light) are overshadowed bythe enormity of Crowley’s intellectual achievement in crafting an all-inclusivesystem of attainment.While these syncretistic tendencies provided an inviting field day forintellectuals, Crowley’s approach was also notable for its pragmatism. As Yeatsdiscovered to his dismay, the synthesis promised by the TS was purelyintellectual; its extreme discomfort with practical work (i.e. magic) was whatultimately drove Yeats to switch his allegiance to the GD. Crowley likewisestripped away the window dressing to get at the heart of various teachings,extracting the practical tools for enlightenment. Crowley and George CecilJones’s distillation of the GD initiation rituals into “Liber Pyramidos” is butone example of this approach. Refreshingly, Crowley—unlike most gurus—challengedhis students to disbelieve him, to experiment and discover for themselves thoseformulae and practices that worked best for them.Another innovation was Crowley’s attempt to apply the rigors of the scientificmethod to a decidedly nonscientific pursuit. From the beginning, The Equinoxdescribed its contents as “The method of science, the aim of religion.” Asscientists kept lab notes, Crowley advocated keeping a magical record tofacilitate tracking the success of magical rituals and the conditions underwhich they were conducted. Likewise, replication was emphasized in order toestablish which methods were most successful. The structured practices andcurriculum of theA[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]A[images/Kacz_9781583945766_epub_L02_r1.jpg]also provided uniformity among his students’ experiments, facilitatingreplication among different practitioners. Finally, in 1929, his magnum opusprovided an operational definition of magick as “the Science and Art of causingChange to occur in conformity with Will.”25[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#epl-nts025] What he proposed didn’tcompletely incorporate the methods of empirical science, but it was a bold stepin that direction.So far, this discussion has focused on Crowley’s innovations as the proponent ofa method of spiritual attainment—a method applicable to the practices of anyfaith. But Crowley was also the prophet of the belief system he called Thelema.While the presence of a revealed holy text gives Thelema the outward appearanceof a religion, its principles are more like a philosophy or spiritualperspective that, like Buddhism, can overlay any particular creed. Indeed, thecentral principle of Thelema—which directs each person to discover the specificrole he or she plays in the cosmic scheme—is compatible with any religiousbelief (although other portions of Liber AL admittedly could be a morechallenging fit).An inviting trait of Thelema is its nonconformity. The epigram “Do what thouwilt shall be the whole of the Law” is a statement of moral relativism.Depending on one’s True Will, what’s right for one person may not be right foranother. It exhorts Thelemites to celebrate their individuality (and theindividuality of others). At its core, it rejects the orthodoxy and schism thatdominated young Crowley’s childhood.26[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#epl-nts026] Partly because its roots liein secret societies, and partly because it presupposes a motive forenlightenment among its adherents, Thelema does not engage in the distastefulstrong-arm proselytizing that is the bane of faiths that encourage testifyingand conversion.Given all his merits and innovations, the natural question is, why wasn’tCrowley more successful than his contemporaries? Crowley’s life story ispeppered with the names of mystics and spiritual philosophers who achievedgreater renown both during their lifetimes and since their deaths: the TS (H. P.Blavatsky, Annie Besant, Charles W. Leadbeater), Anthroposophy (Rudolf Steiner),the Fourth Way (G. I. Gurdjieff, A. R. Orage), AMORC (H. Spencer Lewis), andScientology (L. Ron Hubbard). Why, then, was Crowley so obscure, somisunderstood? There are several reasons.First, Crowley’s books were expensive productions printed in small quantitieswith limited distribution. Even though he priced his works at cost to enhancetheir affordability, his choice of lavish papers and bindings kept them out ofreach for most. Indeed, his audience was largely limited to the affluent (whocould afford the books) and the persistent (who would go to the trouble offinding his works).In addition, most of Crowley’s books are written for what may be termed“hard-core” students. Like any specialist literature, Crowley’s was difficultfor the layperson to approach. His most widely available book, Magick in Theoryand Practice, refers so often to The Equinox or even to unpublished works thatit is a daunting read to anyone who isn’t familiar with his entire corpus. It’snot that Crowley was incapable of writing for a wider audience—see The Revivalof Magick and Other Essays for proof—but that his books of magick were writtenfor a specialized audience.Finally, Crowley was the victim of his own unfortunate choice of terminology.However justifiable his reason for adopting terms like “magick,” “the GreatBeast,” and “Thelema,” the effect was to put people off. The word “magic”suffered from such negative connotations and confusion with stage magic andtrickery that Crowley adopted the spelling “magick” to distinguish what he wastalking about. But even with the k, “magick” produced a knee-jerk associationwith medieval demonology. Consider the times: séances and spiritualists were allthe rage, and Harry Houdini was busy exposing frauds and charlatans.27[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#epl-nts027] In this climate, Crowley’srituals were popularly perceived as spiritualism. They were, in fact, oftenmistakenly called séances, and thereby classed alongside the fakes andpretenders against which he railed.Calling himself “the Great Beast” didn’t help. Despite what AC believed thisfigure from Revelation represented—a solar icon for the Magus of a New Aeon—mostpeople connected it with the devil. The situation is akin to the similarlyunfortunate choice among modern Pagans and Wiccans to reclaim the terms witchand witchcraft. Argue as they may (like Crowley) that the terms mean somethingother than the popular or consensual definitions, centuries of preconceptionsare not easily overturned. Thus today’s witches perpetually complain about theportrayal of witchcraft in books, movies and television just as Thelemites facea similar uphill battle in convincing the man on the street that the Great BeastAleister Crowley was not a devil-worshipper.In a similar way, Crowley’s very message invited misunderstanding. By naming hisphilosophy after the Greek word for will, thelema, Crowley (or Aiwass, if youprefer) guaranteed the term would be received with confusion by a good number ofpeople. This could be clarified by referencing the primary principle of Thelema:“Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.” This same confused personcould understandably conclude Thelema to be a libertarian creed, and wouldbecome only more confused to be told “ ‘Do what thou wilt’ doesn’t mean ‘Do whatyou like.’ ” Indeed, so much of The Book of the Law’s meaning lies not in itsliteral interpretation but in the highly codified meaning of its words that oneis tempted to call it a stylistic forebear of James Joyce’s Finnegans Wake(1939)—although Joyce never met or read AC.28[Kacz_9781583945766_epub_nts02_r1.htm#epl-nts028]Combined, these factors—small and expensive print runs, high expectations forhis audience’s reading level, and the adoption of unsettling or confusingterminology—helped guarantee his circle was confined to a small but devotedgroup of admirers.Crowley’s admirers have grown steadily in number since the 1970s, and it’s easyto see why. He was a fascinating mix of audacity and titillation, mystery anddiscovery, eccentricity and substance; a misfit in his own time but a forebearof social changes that would not occur until well after his death. Half acentury before Timothy Leary told the flower children to “Tune in, turn on, dropout,” AC had experimented with drugs as an adjunct to consciousness expansion.By the time the Beatles had discovered meditation as a consciousness-alteringalternative to drugs, Frater Perdurabo had already been there too. When thebirth control pill sexually liberated a generation, they found Beast had kept alight on in the window. And before the 1980s were dubbed the “Me Generation,”the prophet To Mega Therion had made a religion out of individuality. Rock musicoffers a prime example of AC’s persistent presence in our culture, as he hasbeen embraced by psychedelic rock in the 1960s, hard rock in the 1970s, heavymetal in the 1980s, goth and industrial music in the 1990s, and progressivemetal in the twenty-first century. In our jaded modern age, magick offers anopportunity for adventure and discovery in the only uncharted domain thatdoesn’t require a space shuttle: the spirit. Crowley may be gone, but lookaround: the spirit of Frater Perdurabo endures."},{"pageContent":"NOTESThroughout, Confessions refers to Aleister Crowley’s The Confessions of AleisterCrowley (edited by John Symonds and Kenneth Grant, London: Jonathan Cape, 1969);the unexpurgated Confessions refers to the full work prepared and edited byHymenaeus Beta.

Martin Booth says that Champney came under official observation, theschool closed shortly thereafter, and, impoverished, he applied for aid underthe Clerical Disabilities Act in 1899 (A Magick Life: The Biography of AleisterCrowley, London: Hodder & Stoughton, 2000, p. 23). Conversely, Lawrence Sutin’sDo What Thou Wilt (2000) contends that Champney remained headmaster for anothertwelve years, after which the still-thriving school relocated to Bexhill (DoWhat Thou Wilt: A Life of Aleister Crowley, New York: St. Martin’s Press, 2000,p. 30). Available evidence suggests that the truth may lie somewhere inbetween:The school did not close but was taken over, renamed and ultimately relocated.A. G. Brown, who knew Champney, says Champney “ran the brethren’s school atCambridge which my father [A. J. H. Brown] subsequently took over andtransferred to Bexhill about 1898” (http://mybrethren.org/bios/frambios.htm[http://mybrethren.org/bios/frambios.htm], accessed Apr 23 2010). Indeed, ArthurJohn Henry Brown (1866–1934) is associated wtih the Ebor School inBexhill-on-Sea (College of Preceptors, The Calendar, for the Year 1900, London:Francis Hodgson, p. 200), which was located in Bexhill as early as 1897 (seeEducation Outlook 1897, v. 50), and possibly earlier.114 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-nts114a] Certifed record of death,13 Sep 1888, GRO, Croydon, Surrey.115 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-nts115a] Line 285.116 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-nts116a] Confessions, 73.117 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-nts117a] The bicycle had only beeninvented some twenty-nine years earlier, in 1862, and quickly became a popularalternative to the horse drawn carriage or train.118 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-nts118a] 1891 census, GRO, RG12,piece 1703, 70: 33.

His guess of “Heart of Jesus Girt About Bya Serpent” is wrong. Skinner, in Magical Diaries of Aleister Crowley,incorrectly gives the name “Parzival.” Crowley actually recorded his motto,Christeos Luciftias, in his notebook currently with Special Collections,Northwestern University Library. In Enochian, Christeos is “let there be,” whileLuciftias is “brightness” or “light.” Its obvious Latin analogue Lucifer was nota name of the devil in mystic circles as it is in popular parlance. The nameliterally means “light bringer” and was an ancient name of Venus as the MorningStar. In its older, pre-Christian form, Lucifer was similar to Prometheus, theGreek god who brought fire and light to mankind. It is in this sense of the wordthat H. P. Blavatsky named the Theosophical Society’s magazine Lucifer.57 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_c03_r1.htm#c03-nts057a] Abramelin diary, HRHRC.58 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_c03_r1.htm#c03-nts058a] W. B.

The purpose of a mask for Crowley was tomaintain anonymity: Mathers wanted his representative to act for him in mediares, and not to be associated with any individual within the order. Further, thenotion of masks is an adaptation of the GD instructional document Z1. As Mathersexplained in a letter to M. W. Blackden on April 26, 1900: “to mark hisimpersonality in this matter, I distinguished him by a symbol, and not by aname, and advised him further to wear a mask of Osiris as laid down in Z, shouldthe same be necessary; so as completely to separate and distinguish between hisindividuality and the office with which I had invested him.

The poem “Venus,” op. cit., has the note “Written inthe temple of the L.I.L., No. 9, Central America.” Finally, in Temple of Solomonthe King, Crowley writes, “At the End of the Century: At the End of the Year: Atthe Hour of Midnight: Did I complete and bring to perfection the Work of L.I.L.”(45).21 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_c04_r1.htm#c04-nts021a] Rough working notes of therituals of LIL are pencilled into the back of Crowley’s Jan–May 1901 diary inthe Yorke Collection.22 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_c04_r1.htm#c04-nts022a] These experiments aredescribed in part in The Equinox 1910, 1(4): 107 et seq.23 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_c04_r1.htm#c04-nts023a] See, e.g., Ezequiel Ordóñez,Observaciones relativas a los volcanes de México (México: Imprenta del GobiernoFederal, 1894).

Itwas written in response to Jennings’s immensely popular—but not veryhistorical—book, The Rosicrucians: Their Rites and Mysteries; with Chapters onthe Ancient Fire and Serpent-Worshipers, and Explanations of the Mystic SymbolsRepresented in the Monuments and Talismans of the Primeval Philosophers (London:J.C.

There are some difference in these accounts:While Crowley says he attended Durga Puja, the article refers to the nationalholiday of Diwali, the Hindu festival of light (although it’s possible these twofestivals may have overlapped). AC describes firing once, but two of the sixassailants were shot in the stomach and admitted in serious condition to theChandney Hospital. While the newspaper account suggests that the unidentifiedEuropean fired twice, Crowley writes in his Collected Works, “the apprehensionthat six savages will rob and murder you is immediately allayed by the passageof a leaden bullet […] through the bodies of two of the ringleaders” (v. 3,229). This may make sense of the report that the bullet passed through thestomach and back one of the men, Sheik Nanka, while the other had a bullet thatentered his stomach and lodged in his back.

French violinist-composer Émile Sauret was a child prodigy who beganperforming in Vienna before age eight. His Gradus ad Parnassum du violiniste(Leipzig, 1896) reports that he studied with Vieuxtemps and Wieniawski andplayed on several occasions to the court of Napoleon III. Although he toured theworld, there is no record of him residing or teaching in Sydney; however, from1908 he settled in London and taught at Trinity College of Music. See Roger J.V. Cotte, “Sauret, Emile,” Grove Music Online, www.oxfordmusiconline.com[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com] (accessed Oct 23 2009). Hungarian violinist-teacher Leopold Auer studied at the Budapest and ViennaConservatories from age eight, and went on to a successful career as a performerand orchestra leader. On Anton Rubinstein’s recommendation, he succeededWieniawski in 1868 as violin teacher at the St. Petersburgh Conservatory, wherehe remained until 1917. As one of the most sought-after violin teachers in theworld, he taught in London during the summers of 1906–1911, and in February 1918sailed for New York, where he continued to teach and perform. One of hisstudents, Clara Rockmore, famously went on to become the world’s foremosttheremin player. Leila Waddell had opportunity to study with Auer during hissummers teaching in London, or possibly after he moved to New York.

He gave the impressionof a punctiliously correct Britisher in conventional evening clothes–a big manof heavily athletic build, who looked as if he had spent most of his lifeoutdoors. But the conventionality was only on the surface. On being presented toeach member of the party, instead of murmuring the usual ‘How do you do?’ hesaid:“DO WHAT THOU WILT SHALL BE THE WHOLE OF THE LAW.”And thereafter, for the entire evening, he sat like an incarnation of Buddha,staring straight before him, saying nothing at all. The women of the party, Inoticed, seemed strangely fascinated by this man—a fascination mingled with asort of repulsion and fear.

Crowley expounded his motivesmore fully in his “Affidavit” as follows: “My object was fourfold: (a) todiscredit the German cause by committing the enemy to manifest absurdities andinfamies, (b) to induce the Germans to give me their full confidence, (c) toarouse the indignation of the Americans, (d) to warn England of certain of herown weaknesses by exposing them.”32 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_c12_r1.htm#c12-nts032a] “The Criminal Methods ofCaptain Guy Gaunt, C.M.G., Naval Attaché of the British Embassy: How the BritishSecret Service Rifles United States Mail,” The Fatherland, 24 May 1916, 4(16):243–6.33 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_c12_r1.htm#c12-nts033a] Guy Gaunt, The Yield of theYears: A Story of Adventure Afloat and Ashore (London: Hutchinson & Co, 1940),139.34 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_c12_r1.htm#c12-nts034a] AC to Gerald Yorke, 20 Apr1929, Yorke Collection.

Captain Gauntreplied cordially, but as if The Fatherland were not worth notice”(“Affidavit”). Gaunt’s reference to would-be saboteur Franz von Papen (1879–1969) isinteresting, as Crowley claimed in his “Memorandum” that he reported to Gaunt onthe activities of von Papen’s rival, German spy Franz von Rintelen (1877–1949).Indeed, Crowley’s later acquaintance, George Langelaan (1908–1972)—a Britishwriter best known for science-fiction classic “The Fly” (1957)—reported thatCrowley was indeed a spy, and that by winning the confidence of the Germans inAmerica, he had access to members of their inner circle.

At this party, Leah and AC stared at eachother for a while until Crowley came over and offered them wine. Dockerill,feeling unnerved, tried persuading her sister to leave; Hirsig, however,insisted on remaining, telling her sister to go home and that she would see herlater.

I would he might come forth “his pleasure on the earth to doamong the living.”I gladly offer my body to his Manes, if he need a vehicle of flesh for newexpression. I could never have done quite that for any other spirit—I have beenfaithful to my own Genius.It is maddening to think that I might have known him in the flesh; he died in1903, May 8, eleven months before the First day of the Writing of the book ofthe Law. Just six months after I had met Rodin.I feel very specially that I should consecrate my house to him, not toBeardsley, a quite inferior type deriving from pifflers like Burne-Jones, andthe over-elaborate school of Japanese, while he snivelled and recanteddisgustingly when his health gave way.So, by the Power and Authority invested in Me, I Baphomet 729 ordain theinsertion of the name of PAUL GAUGUIN among the More Memorable Saints in theGnostic Mass.12 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_c14_r1.htm#c14-nts012a] W.

Sullivan depicts their relationship in his autobiographical novel, But forthe Grace of God, calling himself “Julian” and her “Sybil.” In his account,Sybil was an aspiring composer married to Greek scholar Richard Sauncers, whodid not love her. They eventually divorced; although Julian desperately lovedher, Sybil refused to marry him, preferring each of them to retain their“freedom.” As Sullivan wrote, “I see now that this was a disastrous decision forboth of us” (183). This may refer to her affair with Crowley and her subsequentaffair with poet Vivian Locke-Ellis [see 1922–1923: The Collected Letters ofKatherine Mansfield, ed. Vincent O’Sullivan, Vol. 5. (Oxford: Oxford Univ.Press, 2008), 323]. After months of wandering about Paris, Florence, and theRiviera, Julian realized that her ex-husband was right: “Nothing could makeSybil happy. The central core of her was something I could never touch. I wouldnever even be able to understand her” (193). She was later stricken with anunspecified illness and died.54 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_c14_r1.htm#c14-nts054a] AC to Heinrich Tränker, An.XX Sol 26° Capricorn (16–17 Jan 1924), Yorke Collection.

In Bright Young People: The Lost Generation of London’s Jazz Age (New York:Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2009), D. J. Taylor quotes an early impression of theHypocrites Club by the Oxford undergraduate magazine Isis: “The Hypocrites areperhaps the most entertaining people in the University. They express their soulsin terms of shirts and gray flannel trousers and find outlet for their artisticability on the walls of their clubrooms. To talk to they are rather alarming.They have succeeded in picking up the whole series of intellectual catch-phraseswith which they proceed to dazzle their friends and frighten theiracquaintances: and they are the only people I have ever met who have reducedrudeness to a fine art” (p. 30). However, according to Lebedoff, “Thediscussions of philosophy that had formerly made up the principal entertainmentwere supplanted by drunken and licentious revels” when Waugh and his friendsjoined and transformed the club [David Lebedoff, The Same Man: George Orwell andEveyln Waugh in Love and War (New York: Random House, 2008), 29].9 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_c15_r1.htm#c15-nts009a] As Waugh noted upon hiselection to this post, “My predecessor in the office, Loveday, had left theuniversity suddenly to study black magic.” Evelyn Waugh, Brideshead Revisited:The Sacred and Profane Memories of Captain Charles Ryder, a Novel (Boston:Little, Brown, 1945), 180.10 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_c15_r1.htm#c15-nts010a] Greene, Moments of Being,20.

Neither was he a hater of cats, for Yorke states that, in lateryears, Crowley kept one as a pet. In a letter to Roger Staples dated September25, 1963, Yorke wrote, “Symonds is wholly incorrect about the death of Lovedayand the sacrificed cat at Cefalù. He would follow the newspaper accounts of theday which were mostly fabrication by Betty May.” However, on November 3, 1963,Yorke conceded to Staples (private collection), “The cat was indeed sacrificed.It had been making a nuisance of itself by keeping the Cefalù inhabitants awakeat nights. So AC used it for a blood sacrifice—a thing he rarely did. I onlyknow of it, one goat, two pigeons and a few sparrows … and once a toad rituallycrucified.

He was involved in New Southgate politics in the early 1930s,and was the Conservative and Municipal Reform candidate as a councillor in 1933.Later in that decade, he became associated with the National Association ofCycle Traders (NACT), writing The History of the Bicycle (1938); compiling TheNational Association of Cycle & Motor Cycle Traders: Its Aims, Objects andBenefits (1938) and Cycle Traders Unite! (1939); and issuing on its behalf aJoint Memorandum (1942). He was also associated with the Incorporated Instituteof Cycle Traders and Repairers (IICTR)—founded by Arthur Gillott in1941—appearing as the publisher of its 1942 publications.

Crow consecrated Newman a bishop on April 10, 1944, right around the timeCrowley made contact with Crow. Although in later years Newman was no longer “incommunion” with Crow, in his travels he cross-consecrated numerous otherepiscopi vagantes (in other words, the two bishops consecrated each other),“with a view to ‘combining the lines of succession’ under the apparentmisconception that a person is consecrated a bishop of a particular line ofsuccession rather than a bishop of the Church of God” (Brandreth, EpiscopiVagantes, 51). Consequently, Newman’s episcopal name, Mar Georgius I, isdescribed as “ubiquitous” because it turns up in the line of apostolicsuccession of many modern day wandering bishops.20 [Kacz_9781583945766_epub_c22_r1.htm#c22-nts020a] Some have argued that thename “Jehosaphat” derives from or is a transliteration error of the Sanskritword bodhisattva (enlightened being), a title of the Buddha.
