It must ever be so, because ultimately we are each auniverse unto our self. The ‘whatever-it-is-we-are’ was alone when it incarnatedinto this corporeal dimension; and it will be alone at the timeless instant weshuffle off this mortal coil. But as we labor through the measured ticks ofspace-time on this side of the pylons of birth and death our‘whatever-it-is-we-are’ is surrounded and assailed by a vast assortment of other‘whatever-it-is-we-ares’ – other monads of consciousness who are also universesunto themselves – and some of these other universes are fellow magicians.Magick is also (first and foremost) a self-transformational art. It may be themagician’s intent to effect changes in his or her outer life circumstances,i.e., ‘I want the girl next door to fall in love with me…’ but the success ofany magical operation designed to bring about that romantic outcome will mostassuredly be in large part the consequences of the magician becoming transformedinto the type of person the girl next door falls in love with.I’m sure there are knowledgeable and skilled magicians who will disagree with mysweeping assertion that the only thing I can change with Magick is myself. It isof course a statement that is impossible for me to prove or disprove, andfrankly I’m not inclined or motivated to try. I’m not trying to establish ordefend magical doctrine. I simply know that for me – at this season of my life –at this moment in my magical career – the thing that needs to change the most inmy world is me.I have to confess, the prospect of magick being a form of consciously directedself-evolution was not what initially attracted to me to the art so many yearsago. Naturally, I told myself that I was doing all this to gain ‘enlightenment’– to achieve ‘spiritual liberation,’ but in truth it was the allure of wearing ablack-hooded robe and strutting around in darkened temples brandishing my wandand sword against terrible demons cowering in terrified obedience before myradiant adeptship.Man! Would I look cool doing that!No matter how noble and altruistic my conscious pretenses were, Lon MiloDuQuette (the post-adolescent magician) inwardly desired power – power to masterthe cruel and chaotic circumstances of my life – power to right the wrongs I waswitnessing in the world around me – power to set things straight and in harmonywith my own (obviously already enlightened) vision of personal, moral, social,political, and spiritual absolutes.As comically deluded as I might have been, there is of course nothingfundamentally wrong with such youthful and militant idealism – nothing wrongwith wanting to change the world for the better and setting to work to do justthat. I guess the biggest flaw in my aspirational game-plan was that I wasoverlooking the fact that in order for me to use magick to begin making thesechanges I would first have to consciously evolve into a real magician. As luckwould have it, I would early in my career come under the influence and tutelageof magicians who would each in their unique way (either by positive example,negative example, or admonition) make sure I never forgot this fundamental factof life.Foremost among my senior mentors were Phyllis Secker (Soror Meral), Grady L.McMurtry (Hymenaeus Alpha, 777), Helen Parsons-Smith (Soror Grimaud), andFrancis (Israel) Regardie. All of these dear people are now deceased.McMurtry and Regardie trained directly under Aleister Crowley, and Seckler hadbeen the student of Jane Wolfe, a student of Crowley’s and a one-time residentof Crowley’s famous Abbey of Thelema in Sicily. Parsons-Smith was the doublewidow of Jack Parsons (the famed magician and rocket scientist) and Wilfred T.Smith – both were, at different times, Masters of Agape Lodge, O.T.O. inSouthern California.These colorful people kept me from being entirely alone in the early years of myquest. Because of their efforts (and more often despite their efforts) I was inthe mid 1970s baptized in the magick fire of Thelema. With their encouragement,cynicism, and guidance, I formally took up the disciplines of Crowley’s magicalorders, the A.A. and Ordo Templi Orients.My A.A. work began under the guidance of Seckler and was (or should have been)an entirely private affair. My O.T.O. experience, on the other hand, required meto work in a more public manner and with other magicians all over the world –sometimes many other magicians. In fact, an important aspect of the O.T.O.’smagical curriculum is the development of the individual magician’s ability towork in concert (and survive) within the complexities of a uniquely organizedsociety populated by cast of militantly independent magicians (some of whom areas intractable, imperfect and flawed as myself!). It’s a very important part ofthe magical training of an O.T.O. initiate.As you might expect, Crowley didn’t make the O.T.O. ordeal an easy one. In fact,I’ve known more promising magicians to wreck on the shoals of the Order’ssocietal challenges than for any other reason. More often than not, however, Iusually come to see the wisdom and genius of Crowley’s magical vetting process.Whether or not they have established a formal A.A. relationship, a great manyO.T.O. initiates and others who consider themselves Thelemic magicians embark onthe study and practice of the various rituals Crowley developed for theedification of A.A. magicians. The systematic practice of these rituals vis avis the magician’s personal initiatory climb up the Tree of Life ofconsciousness is generally viewed in Thelemic circles as “doing the work.”The work is certainly there to do. The rituals and a few commentaries arepublished in a plethora of sources. One of the finest collections is found inthe magnificently ponderous Liber ABA, Book IV1, but for many years most of usrelied almost exclusively on those ritual ‘Libers’ that appeared in theAppendices of Magick in Theory and Practice.Armed with little more than these Libers and the roadmap of the Tree of Life,four generations of magicians have set out alone on the Thelemic path of return;dissecting, cross-referencing, and trying to make sense of the bewilderingsubtleties of Crowley’s evolving thought, and then attempting to transfer thatunderstanding to the temple environment in coherent ceremonies that can beperformed by (and for the benefit of) one person. To say it is a challenge tothe lone magician would be a ‘beastly’ understatement.Yes. Magick is a lonely art. But does it always need to be that lonely?I don’tbelieve so – and neither does my Brother Rodney Orpheus. People – even magicians– sometimes need other people. There are moments in my life when I don’t knowwhat I am, where I am, or who I am unless I can see myself momentarily reflectedin the souls of others around me.The term “Thelemic group ritual” may sound like an oxymoron, but it needn’t beone. As Brother Orpheus reveals, many of Crowley’s most significant ritualsstarted out as group operations. For me, it is profoundly helpful (at times evennecessary) to see the complex dynamics of my own inner magical mechanismsportrayed as different ‘officers’ in a ritual. I can, and of course musteventually integrate all these officers into myself, but first I have to knowwho they are, what they do, and what they mean to me. That is most easily andelegantly done by seeing them operate in a group drama.I took one look at Rodney’s group treatments of the Ritual of the Mark of theBeast and the Invocation of Horus and was thrown back in my chair in stunnedadmiration, “My gods! Why hasn’t someone done this before?” This might soundlike a rhetorical question, but in fact it does indeed have an answer. Thereason someone hasn’t done this before is because there are presently very fewindividuals living today who are qualified by education and experience to do so,and even fewer with the writing talent and communication skills to bring it allto life on the printed page. Brother Orpheus is the incarnation of both theseaspects of genius. Whether he is expanding upon classic Crowley rituals orcreating and developing his own Thelemic ceremonies, the magician reader can beconfident he or she is in good hands.Magick may be a lonely art, but that doesn’t mean we must always be alone on ourjourney – and it doesn’t mean we won’t always need friends.Love is the law, love under will.PrefaceNo man is an island. However looking at the plethora of self-help bookslittering the New Age Spirituality section of the average bookstore you’d beforgiven for thinking we were all islands awash in a sea of our own obsessivebehavior. While it is true that our approach to the gods must be an intenselypersonal journey, and that each individual must find their own path, it is alsoclearly true that mankind is a social animal, with a hard-wired need to shareexperience and work together towards a common goal.Generally speaking there have been two major evolutionary factors in humanity’srise to dominance of the Earth:1. our ability to manipulate our environment so that it can fit us better, usingtools and constructing clothing and shelter2. our ability to work together in communities, sharing work out to those bestfitted to do it, and communicating our individual thoughts to each other toeducate and instructIn my own previous work Abrahadabra I concentrated very much on the first ofthese two things - giving people tools to use for their own individualdevelopment. However I have noticed since then that alongside spiritualdevelopment comes a desire to share those experiences, and deepen them in thesharing. From this desire springs the phenomenon of cults, magical orders, andorganised religions. Even the most introspective and individual of religioussystems inevitably gives rise to the collective experience.Both my first book and this one are based on the principles of Thelema. Thelemais a spiritual system designed by Aleister Crowley about a hundred years ago,which has become increasingly popular in recent years. It is ideally suited tospiritual practices in the post-Einstein modern world since it asserts thatthere is no absolute moral dogma, no big god in the sky that we have to bow downto, and no evil demon who will make us burn in hell for our sins. As Crowley soaptly summed it up:> “There is no grace: there is no guilt:> This is the Law: DO WHAT THOU WILT!”Ironically of course, this means that you don’t actually have to call yourself aThelemite to work with the Thelemic system. Thelema allows you to be what youwant, and believe what you want, while still being able to focus on thepractical application of your spiritual belief. This practical application iswhat Crowley refers to as Magick - the Science and Art of causing Change tooccur in conformity with Will. So even if you don’t identify yourself with beinga Thelemite as such, you can still easily and happily work with the ritualsgiven in this book. Whether you call yourself a Gnostic, a Wiccan, a Buddhist,or even a Christian, you will absolutely be able to work with the the materialgiven here and achieve great results.To many beginners, Thelema seems to be one of the most individually-orientedspiritual systems, since it is fundamentally based on the primacy of the Will ofeach individual person. Yet the very first principle of Thelema - Do what thouwilt shall be the whole of the Law - emphasises not the self, but the other.When I say this phrase I am not talking about my Will, I’m talking about yours.I am affirming that you have the right to do your Will. It is a statement thatabove all is about my relationship with other people, not about myself alone.No matter how individual we are, we’re still human beings, we still need toshare our experiences and deepen it in interaction with others. Many people willsee this as a contradiction in terms, because they think that there must alwaysbe a big difference between the desire of an individual and the dynamic of agroup. However many Thelemites would refute this thesis, and state that the onlyworthwhile group is one made up of people working together voluntarily towards acommon goal. However it’s certainly not easy, which is why Thelemic magicalorders like O.T.O. exist - to provide a solid framework for Thelemites to workwithin.Aleister Crowley, in a letter to his successor Karl Germer in 1942, shows thathe too had an awareness of this issue. He says:> “The broad base of public association is the Gnostic Mass... The other rituals> will have to tail along as best they can... Of course, the minor secrets in> them have their special magical value, so that they will always maintain a> certain use to certain types of mind. Also, the actual magical effect on the> candidate may be of the greatest value to him, and the training and discipline> are always useful.”He was specifically referring to the O.T.O. initiation rituals here, but thegeneral point stands. There is no doubt that the Gnostic Mass is the pinnacle ofCrowley’s achievement when it comes to group ritual working, and he would nodoubt feel extremely gratified and proud that it is now celebrated on a weeklybasis by O.T.O. bodies across the globe. However Crowley also wrote aconsiderable number of other group rites that have been largely overlooked andalso “may be of the greatest value” to us.When I first got involved in Thelema in the 1970s, the number of Thelemites inthe world was probably in the low hundreds, scattered all over the globe. Veryfew of them ever met, and if they did it was infrequent at best. So there wasreally no need for a book on Thelemic group ritual, and the books that werepublished on Thelema reflected that, being largely aimed at the solo magician.Since then, only thirty years later, that situation has changed dramatically,and continues to change.Globally there are now tens of thousands of Thelemites, with O.T.O. alonecurrently having around 4000 members, and growing year on year. Almost everymajor world city has at least one Thelemic group. In the past years sincepublishing my first book I’ve visited many O.T.O. bodies around the world, ofall sizes and levels of experience. All of them have been formed of peoplecoming together to try to create a true Thelemic community and to explore themysteries of the human experience together. O.T.O., in common with most magicalorders, is based on a series of initiation rites, which gradually reveal themysteries of the cycle of existence to the initiate. However, since initiationrites tend to occur fairly infrequently (usually about once a year at most foreach member of the group) practically speaking in most cases they cannot providethe kind of regular group magical experience that a spiritual community needs,especially in a smaller local group. So the most frequent question I’m asked bynew (and not so new) magical groups when I visit is “Well, we have a group ofpeople here, so what do we do now?” Hence this book.Rituals only manifest magical power when they are performed. Without thatexperiential component they are, quite literally, meaningless. Reading a ritualand thinking you know what it means is like reading a love poem and thinking youknow what love is. Anyone who has read the text of the Gnostic Mass, and thenattended a performance of it, will know what I mean. Reading alone cannot bringover even a fraction of the beauty, power, and intensity of great ritualperformance.So in collating and editing the rituals presented here, performance has been mynumber one priority. Many of the rites have either never been published properlybefore, or when they have been, evidence suggests that they were rarely, ifever, performed beforehand. Many were clearly left unfinished or containedsignificant internal errors. Accordingly in many cases they’ve had to be greatlyamended to make them performable. Crowley scholars looking for an exactreproduction of his unpublished notes are therefore likely to be disappointed.In making edits I have however tried to stick as closely as possible to theoriginal texts, and where I’ve had to add dialogue I’ve borrowed from Crowley’sown writings rather than add my own. I’ve tried to ensure that the end resultremains faithful to the authors’ original intent, while also making thempractical and workable.Another important thing to remember about the performance of ritual: you don’thave to be some sort of expert to start doing magick! Even if you are a completebeginner to this stuff, don’t let that stop you. Many of the rituals here wereoriginally written to be performed by people with little or no magicalbackground or deep knowledge. That’s actually kind of the point: you learn aboutritual by actually doing it. Doing one good ritual will teach you more thanreading one hundred bad books. So don’t assume you have to have a library ofoccult tomes, or need to be trained for years by some ancient magical Orderbefore starting this stuff. Just get together with this book and a couple offriends and get going. Your performance might not win any Oscars, but it willget results, and you’ll learn a lot in the process.Although this is a specifically Thelemic compendium, and based largely on theworks of Aleister Crowley, it should be borne in mind that no man is an islandin time either. While researching these rites it has become ever more apparentto me that our work today is a continuation of a current that rolls throughoutthe centuries, from Ancient Egypt, through the Greek Mysteries, Roman Mithraism,Gnosticism, the Knights Templar, medieval demonology, the Rosicrucians, and manymore. I think it’s important that we honour these our ancestors, and respect thesacrifices they made to communicate this Hidden Tradition to us, often againstgreat odds. Accordingly in this book you’ll also find rituals originatingseveral centuries ago, but which have a strong historical connection to modernThelema, and updated for performance in the world today.In some cases, especially in the sections of the book dealing with Goetia andGnosticism, I’ve rewritten some historical rituals to conform with Thelemicideas. Whereas I’d like to think that this is an innovation on my part, there isalready quite a precedent for it, not least by Gerald B. Gardner. Gardner was aVII° member of O.T.O. and combined parts of the Book of the Law and the GnosticMass with older ritual texts to create his revived witch cult rites, withCrowley’s encouragement; and it was these synthetic rites that led to thedevelopment of modern-day Wicca.However this isn’t just a book listing the texts of a bunch of rituals. There’sa lot more to working in a group than simply getting together to recite a fewmystical sentences once a week. A group’s power lies in more than being acollection of individuals, it is also in the relationships that exist betweenindividuals. So throughout the book I’ve tried to point out how important it isto foster healthy group dynamics. In this occult world of ours it’s very easyfor emotions to run high, which can lead to disastrous consequences ifrelationships are not carefully nurtured. On the other hand, it can also lead tosome of the deepest and most fulfilling relationships you’ll ever have withanother group of people, and for that reason if no other has much to recommendit.I am indebted to Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior O.T.O. for first bringingCrowley’s unpublished ritual notes to my attention and thus providing theoriginal inspiration for this book, and for his research assistance during thewriting of it; Brother Lon Milo DuQuette for his unflagging support; Bishops TauApiryon and Helena for bringing together so much wisdom; David Rankine forsharing his profound knowledge of Goetia; Brother Richard Kaczinski fornitpicking in all the best ways; Brother Adrian Dobbie and Ulysses Black fordesign and layout, not an easy job in a book like this; the members ofQuetzalcoatl Lodge (Brazil), Southern Cross Oasis (Australia), Tamesa Oasis,Tamion Camp, and Ameth Lodge (UK) for beta testing; all of the people around theworld who wrote to tell me how much my first book meant to them; and last butmost certainly not least, my Sister Cathryn Orchard for research, illustrations,feedback, and love. It would take a whole other book to describe fully how muchI owe you.I am also indebted to Richard M. Stallman, Tim Berners-Lee, Mark Shuttleworthand the Ubuntu team, the LibreOffice team, the Internet Sacred Text Archive, andto the Free Open Source Software community at large, for not only providing mewith the tools to create this book, but also creating a truly Thelemiccommonwealth of mutual respect, information sharing, and aid that is a model formodern society.This book is not a comprehensive list of all Thelemic group rituals that exist,nor should it be. Thelema is a young religion, only a century old, and we arestill creating it every day. By all means work with the rituals here, but Iencourage you to examine them closely and learn how to extend and (hopefully)improve them. We’re all learning (even me) and it would give me no greaterpleasure than to see people using this work as a springboard to even greaterefforts in the future.Rodney OrpheusManchester, Europe, 2010A Note on SafetyMagical rituals frequently make use of items that can be dangerous if misused:candles and other naked flames; daggers, swords, and other slashing and piercingweapons; water; and of course, those heavy, ungainly things we call our bodies.All of these things have killed and seriously injured people in the past, andit’s up to you to make sure that you don’t join their number in the future. Eachtime you add another person to your magical group you exponentially increase thelikelihood of an accident happening. Don’t just think that an accident mighthappen: the law of averages says that sooner or later it will happen! I’m a verycareful person, yet I myself have had to be rushed to hospital in an ambulancewhen I was (accidentally) stabbed during a group ritual. I really don’t wantthat to happen again - to me or anyone else.To that end here are some important safety notes. And I do mean important -these are rules, not suggestions. Following these rules is not optional in agroup setting! So when you start to work with any magical group, discuss theserules first, make sure everyone is aware of them, and that everyone agrees withthem. If someone doesn’t agree, then don’t argue about it, just make it clearthat they need to leave the temple. That’s all there is to it.1. Always have a fire extinguisher in the temple, and make sure that everyoneknows where it is, and how to operate it. Only use it if the fire is very smallor someone is actually alight. In general it’s better to concentrate on gettingeveryone out of the building safely than try to fight a fire. Possessions arereplaceable, you are not.2. Make sure there is a clear exit route in case of emergency, and that everyoneknows where it is.3. Don’t wear robes with big floppy sleeves and then reach over naked flames.Don’t wear hairspray either. I’ve seen more than one person set themselves onfire during a ritual for just those reasons.4. If you’re working in some else’s temple, or outdoors in a forest, make surethat you have permission to use naked flames. If you don’t, lose the candles andcharcoal and use battery torches instead.5. Make sure that all burning items are in secure fireproof holders. Do not usesmall tea lights unless you have special candle holders to put them in - themetal surround that they come with is not a candle holder and can achieveridiculous temperatures if left unattended. Don’t leave smouldering charcoallaying around either, it can flare up and do some serious high temperaturedamage if you’re not careful, especially outdoors. A forest fire is a very badthing indeed, you really don’t want to be stuck in the middle of one.6. No sharp blades! Daggers and swords are called weapons for a reason: they aredesigned to kill people. All blades in temple must be blunted. I don’t care howproud you may be of your original 18th century samurai sword, if it can cut meand hurt me, it doesn’t belong in the same room as me. So either blunt it ordump it. There can be no exceptions to this rule.7. Whereas flagellation has a long and noble history both as a spiritual and asexual technique, if a ritual calls for whipping to be used, please go easy.There’s no need to hurt someone, and in many countries beating someone until youcause a mark or draw blood is illegal and can have you thrown in prison even ifthey fully consent. If in doubt, keep it symbolic.8. Don’t draw blood in a public setting. There are some Thelemic rituals thatcall for blood-letting (most notably the Mass of the Phoenix) but this should bekept private, partly for the legal reasons stated above, but more importantlyfor reasons of hygiene. There are many pathogens borne by blood, don’t pass themaround. You don’t want to catch some nasty disease, or cause someone else tocatch it.9. Don’t flail your arms around, or spin round without looking. You’d be amazedat how many times I’ve seen someone get smacked in the face accidentally duringa ritual. Remember that you will frequently be working in a confined space withseveral other people moving around, so move slowly and watch what you’re doing.10. Don’t mix electricity and water. The result isn’t nice.11. When in doubt, safety first. If you think something might be unsafe, thenassume that it is and don’t do it.12. Remember it’s not just your safety you are dealing with during any groupritual, it’s other people’s safety as well. You might be prepared to take a riskwith your own body, but you have no right to put someone else at risk too.Chapter OneThe Ritual of the Mark of the BeastAleister Crowley wrote a great number of magical rituals during his long andprolific career, but arguably his finest ritual is Liber V vel Reguli, which wasoriginally published in Crowley’s masterpiece Magick in Theory and Practice in1929. This rite, also known as the Mark of the Beast ritual, is a version of oneof the most fundamental rituals in the Hermetic magical tradition, the PentagramRitual.Pentagram rituals belong to a class of ritual generally known as “Banishing”rituals, although that’s rather a misleading term, since they don’t really just“banish” things. They are designed to set up a neutral ritual space that amagician can work in, and to invoke energy into the magician in order to powerthe Will. A pentagram ritual is an entirely self-contained magical operation,and the regular practice of doing one of these pentagram rituals is highlyrecommended to beginning magicians.Pentagram rituals were first popularised in the late 19th century by the GoldenDawn magical order, where Aleister Crowley received much of his early training.The Golden Dawn and its followers make much of the theory that all magical workshould be opened and closed by a pentagram ritual being performed. This is farfrom being the universal law that some people might claim, and although it cancertainly be beneficial in some cases, is rarely necessary. It also tends toreduce the pentagram ritual from the position of being a perfectly fineinvocation in itself to being something that’s little more than a prelude toother magical work, which is a terrible shame.Aleister Crowley was a huge fan of the pentagram ritual, and taught the GoldenDawn version of it to all of his early students. However as time went on Crowleyrightly saw that the G.D.’s pentagram ritual, despite its popularity, had someserious technical faults, and for many years attempted to amend and improve it.His first attempt was a ritual called the Star Ruby, published in the Book ofLies around 1912, and later even more amended.Even that didn’t seem to be enough for Crowley though, and in the 1920’s hebegan work on the Mark of the Beast ritual, an even more radical revision of thePentagram ritual. The O.T.O. Archives contain an early typescript of the ritualmade by Crowley in about 1926, complete with several notes by him and one of hisyoung students at the time, Gerald Yorke. The version presented in thetypescript is obviously a work in progress, and contains sections later excisedor radically changed in the final published version. In particular, in contrastto the final solo version of Liber Reguli, this early draft was intended to be aritual for group working.We know that Crowley had been using some kind of Pentagram ritual as part ofO.T.O. group workings in 1921, when he wrote to the head of the American O.T.O.,Charles Stansfeld Jones:> “We are having great success every night with rituals, the order being> Pentagram, Creed, Collects, then anything special as occasion dictates,> Benediction and O.T.O. applause. The effect has been magnificent.”Crowley to Jones, January 25, 1921The Creed, Collects, and Benediction were taken from the text of Liber XV, TheGnostic Mass, which was designed from the outset as a group rite, howeverPentagram rituals up until this point were primarily designed for solopractitioners. I think it quite likely then that the Mark of the Beast ritualmay have been designed by Crowley around this period as an attempt to remedythis and create a more group-oriented Pentagram ritual.The group sections in Crowley’s early recension of the Mark of the Beast ritualare fairly minimal, being confined to a chorus adding Thelemic affirmations tothe beginning/ending section of the rite (the “Qabalistic Cross” sections). Thebulk of the rite is basically a fairly standard pentagram ritual performed byone person. As such it’s not really an ideal group working, which is probablywhy Crowley dropped the group parts when he published it in 1929. However I dothink that with the group sections added back in, it could be very useful as aritual to open or close a general Lodge meeting, and a good way to get peopleinvolved in the performance of this excellent rite.If your group is holding regular meetings or classes that don’t have a majorritual component, one good exercise might be to have one member of the group(called the Magician in the ritual) perform this at the start or end of theevening, rotating this principal role at every meeting so that each member ofthe group gets to do the “starring role” at least once. Be careful not to fallinto the trap of having the same person or couple of people do the principalrole each time. If someone says “You know it better than me, so you should do itevery time” then that’s a message that they need to be taught how to do itbetter! The last thing any group needs is a couple of experienced people doingeverything and not leaving room for new members to learn and flourish. So doplease resist that temptation at all costs. Remember that one of the foundationstones of Thelema is that “every man and every woman is a star”, so make sureeveryone has a chance to shine.The original typescript of the Mark of the Beast ritual has several points withquestion marks after them, and in a couple of places has several variations ofthe symbols marked out; clearly showing that Crowley didn’t consider itcomplete, and was still trying to work out how it should all fit together. Ispent some considerable time trying to reconstruct a working version of the ritefrom the original Crowley typescript notes, but eventually realised that ifCrowley couldn’t do it then I probably couldn’t either.In the end I decided to just use the published version from Magick in Theory andPractice, since clearly that was what Crowley considered the final revision; butwith the addition of the original group parts from the early version. As soon asI added those back in and made a couple of minor tweaks, suddenly the ritualbegan to make sense as a viable group rite.This synthetic version also has the advantage that if you already know thestandard solo version of the Mark of the Beast ritual, it’s quite easy toperform the role of the Magician in a group setting without having to shiftgears radically; and conversely, being part of a group performance of it helpsyou learn it as a ritual for your own solo workings.Note that in this ritual the pentagrams are drawn “averse”, or upside-down towhat is general usage in most Pentagram rituals. Contrary to popular belief,this does not imply that they are “evil” or “negative” in any way - reallythere’s no such thing as the “correct” way to draw a pentagram, it’s purely aconvention. The pentagram is a star, and stars in the sky have no up or down,right way or averse way, they just are. I suspect that Crowley drew them thisway because conventionally the single point upright pentagram symbolicallyrefers to the divine spirit conquering matter, whereas the two points upwardversion refers to the divine descending into matter. Since the Mark of the Beastritual is essentially about bringing divine energy down to the earth (as isinvocation generally), then using the pentagrams in this form makes logicalsense.An interesting feature of this ritual is that it uses the so-called InvokingPentagrams, rather than the Banishing Pentagrams used in most other Pentagramrituals. Frankly I don’t consider it particularly important either way since allPentagram rituals are essentially invocations of divine energy regardless ofwhich pentagram you use or what way up you draw it.

Pointing the wand to the centre of the Pentagram, let him call upon BABALON!> [See Atu XI again - Babalon is the Goddess riding on the Beast.]17. Let all give the sign Mulier. The feet are widely separated, and the armsraised so as to suggest a crescent. The head is thrown back (attitude ofBaphomet, Isis in Welcome, the Microcosm of Vitruvius). (See Book 4, Part II).18. Let the Magician break into the dance, tracing a centripetal spiralwiddershins, enriched by revolutions upon his axis as he passeth each quarter,until he come to the centre of the circle.

Let him raise the wand, trace the Mark of the Beast, and cry AIWAZ!> [Crowley’s notes say: Trace the mark where Sol is Hadit, Luna Nuit, and the> Testes 666 and 156.

Over a period of a few days Aleister hadbeen performing rituals to introduce his new bride to magick, a subject aboutwhich she knew nothing. Much to his surprise, each time he did so Rose wouldfall into a trance and receive instructions that they should invoke the Egyptiangod Horus. She gave detailed instructions as to the setting of the ritual, whichwas quite different to what Aleister had been used to from his training in theGolden Dawn; but he reluctantly went ahead with it at noon on March 19th as hehad been instructed. He was not impressed with the results, but Rose told him heshould perform it again at midnight as well. This time, the rite was a hugesuccess, and Aleister was informed (presumably again via the mediumship of Rose)that “The Equinox of the Gods had come”, and that he was to prepare a link“between the solar-spiritual force and mankind”.It was this ritual that led to the writing of The Book of the Law in the sameroom a few days later on April 8-10, and the inauguration of what would becomethe Thelemic system of magick. So if your and your companions are planning tostart performing rituals together, or to establish yourselves as a group, thisis a fitting ritual to start work with; it’s relatively simple to perform andvery powerful.It may not be obvious at first glance that this is a group ritual, and indeedsince then it has frequently been performed as a solo rite; but it should beremembered that the setup instructions do specify “white robes” plural, and thatthere were two people involved in the original performance, both Aleister andRose Crowley. We can assume that Aleister was the one saying all the words,while Rose acted as the Seer, or focus for the divine energy, and spoke with thevoice of the God. Although she may not have had any experience with magickbefore she was clearly fully able to play a vital role in the performance ofthis ritual. There’s an important lesson there: that even if you are completelyinexperienced you may be perfectly capable of performing powerful and importantmagick; so never let lack of experience stop you from doing what you need to do.Something else that may not be obvious is that this was written as a divinatoryrite - the idea was to invoke Horus so that he could transmit a message that waswaiting for Aleister. In practice this rite can still be used for divinatorypurposes by us today, but I think it needs to be borne in mind that we aren’tthe Crowleys, nor is this still the dawn of the New Aeon of Thelema - the NewAeon that this ritual initially heralded is here now and we are in the midst ofit. We are already living through the results of the original performance ofthis ritual and the message transmitted by it. As such, I think it’s morefitting for us to use it as a commemorative or celebratory ritual.Whereas the rite was presumably originally written for recitation by one persononly, it lends itself easily to adaptation for a larger group, and the version Igive here is built around the classic call and response format. Call andresponse is a great way to run any group ritual, especially in a group wheresome are less experienced than others - one person can lead the invocation witheveryone else joining in the response. This format is a very common ritualtechnique across many different cultures and religions around the world, fromAfrican shamanism to High Christian Masses. However you shouldn’t assume thatbecause one person leads and the others follow that this means that only oneperson is “active” in the rite - everyone is an active participant and addspower to the invocation.The ritual contains rich visual imagery, much of it derived from the classicalEgyptian myths about Horus. Each participant should try to visualise what isbeing described during the rite, in order to formulate the god’s presence morestrongly. Studying a book on Egyptian myths beforehand might be very useful. E.A. Wallis Budge’s Gods of the Egyptians came out in the same year as this ritualwas originally written, and although it’s not considered to be the mostscholarly work these days, it is a good snapshot of the prevailing wisdom at thetime, and is easily available.If one person is going to perform most of the Horus invocation, it may be anidea for them to be robed as described in the later section of the text i.e. awhite robe edged in gold with a red descending triangle affixed to the chest; ahead wrapping in white and gold; a sword; and a wand of some sort.The original text simply ends with the line “The Adoration - Impromptu”;presumably the idea was that by this stage the Seer would be sufficientlyovercome that Horus would take over and direct the ritual himself from there. InMagick, Chapter 19, On Dramatic Rituals, Crowley writes:> “Following the climax there should always be an unrehearsed ceremony, an> impromptu. The most satisfactory form of this is the dance. In such ceremonies> appropriate libations may be freely used.”I’m far from convinced that this is a good universal rule. In my experience,“impromptu” can be a rather dangerous word in a group ritual situation.Impromptu sections can sometimes degenerate into egoistic posturing orgrandstanding by one or more members of the group; or equally bad, into a bunchof people looking at each other sheepishly wondering what to do next that won’tbe totally embarrassing for each of them. For these reasons I usually try not toleave any loose ends like this in a group setting. I’d suggest that rather thanleaving the Adoration to be completely impromptu, that the group decidebeforehand roughly what format the Adoration should take, and stick to it.Possibilities for the Adoration could include:1. Have a statue of Horus in the temple, or an altar dedicated to him. Then atthe end of the ritual, have each person come before it and place an offeringthere - this could be a garland of flowers, an offering of food or drink, orperhaps to anoint the statue with a small amount of holy oil.2. Simply have each person stand, sit, or kneel in silent meditation, eitherwith their eyes closed or perhaps focused on an image of the god, or on a copyof the Stele of Revealing.The Adoration period doesn’t have to be too long, but I would recommend that itbe at least a few minutes. A good ten minutes or more would be ideal - after thepreceding invocations you’ll probably need that amount of time just to deal withthe energy coursing through your system.During this period of adoration, each person should attempt to communicate withHorus, build up an image of him in their mind, feel his energy coursing throughtheir body, etc. If there’s something that they particularly desire the god’shelp with, now would be a good time to focus on that magical intention too.Remember that in this rite, the participants are invoking Horus into themselves(see the last paragraph of the invocation, where it says “Come thou forth anddwell in me”). So you are adoring the god incarnating inside yourself, andthrough that adoration attaining direct communication with his essence.The Invocation of HorusParticipants: Two or more.

Crowley never published it, andthus the version that has come down to us isn’t quite as polished as somethinglike the Mark of the Beast. However it’s still fairly complete and veryworkable.A litany is another form of “call and response” ritual, where the officersrecite various invocatory statements and the other participants respond with arepeated phrase or phrases, as we saw in the Invocation of Horus earlier.This ritual requires a main opening officer, noted in the text as M.A., aCongregation (to perform the responses), and preferably several other officerswho take on the various Egyptian god forms. This ideally would require onefemale to play the role of Nepthys and three males to play Harpocrates, Horusand Osiris respectively. Optionally one female can be chosen to play Isis,although she doesn’t actually have any speech in the rite. However it might beuseful to have someone attired as this goddess to act as a focus (see note onthis below). If your group is small the M.A. could perform all the calls, withthe other members present performing the appropriate responses.It’s not stated anywhere in the ritual notes we have what M.A. stands for - itprobably means Major Adept. It’s not really vital for us to know, since thetitle used isn’t significant within the context of this ritual. In practice itjust means “the person running the ritual”. This might be the leader of yourgroup, but it doesn’t have to be.It’s important to bear in mind that the leader of a magical group might be theoverall administrator and decision maker for the group’s progress, but theleadership of specific magical workings can and should be passed around themembership of the group. And during the time of the ritual performance itself,whoever is in the lead role is the leader until the ritual is over. It doesn’tmatter if it’s the most timid and least experienced member of the group, if theyare performing the role of M.A. (or any other lead role in a ritual) they are incharge until the end of the working, and should be respected as such; as long asthey stay within the rules of the constitution of the group, and within thelimits of the safety instructions. So don’t go second-guessing the ritual leaderin the middle of a working, it’s not usually very helpful.However there’s another side of that you should remember: no-one in a groupshould ever have absolute power. The group should have a set of clear rules andguidelines for how people are expected to comport themselves, and whereauthority begins and ends. If a group you join don’t have their basicconstitution written down and available to all the members, then suggest thatthey should. Rules like these don’t have to be particularly complex, they can bejust a couple of simple sentences spelling out the basic attitude that the groupexpects of everyone. And I do mean everyone, there should never be one rule forthe members and a different rule for the leaders.The group must also have a clearly understood set of safety procedures, andstick to them. If anyone ever tries to force you to ignore the safety proceduresI’ve given at the beginning of the book, do feel confident to simply stand upand refuse. No-one has the right to put you in danger, no matter what spuriousmagical reasons they might come up with. And under no account ever join anygroup where the leader is expected to hold absolute power over the othermembers. I don’t care how exalted and wise he or she is, or whether they reallyare the Son of God - we’re all the Children of the Gods, so this isn’t much of abig deal when you get down to it. Your life is every bit as important as theirs.It’s not the job of a magical group leader to dictate your morality or yoursexuality, or what you say and do in your daily life. It’s their job to run amagical group, and that’s all. A good rule of thumb is that if the members of agroup - and that means all the members, including the leaders - don’t treat eachother with mutual respect, it’s not a group you should be in.But back to the ritual...As regards attire and general setup, nothing is specified in the survivingtypescript. So really it can be as simple or complex as desired. Normal magicalrobes could be worn, but better still the officers could be dressed in costumestraditionally associated with ancient Egypt or with the gods they are playing.Setting up statues of the gods invoked, or Egyptian hangings and pictures helpsto set the mood; and having some incense burning is a good thing in almost anyritual. Feel free to use your imagination with this one, and build a good, butfitting, setting for the performance - your efforts will be well rewarded.The ritual itself is basically in two parts: an introductory dialogue and thelitanies proper. In the introduction, the M.A. asks certain questions which arereplied to by the Brothers present or by the Sisters present. This dialoguebetween them sets up the focus of the rite and prepares the participants for theinvocation that follows.In the original text the speech given here for Osiris was not associated withany god. However the text itself in that section clearly identifies the speakeras Osiris, so I’ve taken the liberty of adding him in formally.Unfortunately, although the ritual is quite beautiful, it doesn’t really end; itjust stops, with no resolution or climactic point - a common problem with manyof Crowley’s group rituals. During testing, participants often reported thatwhen they reached the last litany they felt “all dressed up with nowhere to go”.I suspect that the typescript we have here may actually be missing another pagewith more text for the rite, or some explanation of it.Since the intent of the operation is clearly to invoke the goddess Isis, andinvocation means to call spirit into something material, I think it pertinent toask into what exactly is Isis to be invoked? We need some sort of material basisto contain the Holy Spirit, yet the ritual as it comes down to us makes nomention of such a thing. We have several options:1. Invoke the goddess into a fixed inanimate object, such as a statue, which canthen be used an a visible object of worship or meditation in the future2. Invoke the goddess into an appropriate necklace, ring, or other piece ofjewellery which can be worn as a talisman, and thus keep the influence of thegoddess near at all times3. If there are enough participants, nominate one to play the role of Isis, andhave the Holy Spirit invoked into them. That person can then use the power ofthe Goddess to bless the participants in turn; or perhaps to act as an oracle,by drawing Tarot cards, casting a Yi King hexagram, or other appropriatedivinatory mechanism.So before setting up the ritual decide which of these options is going to fitbest with your group and prepare accordingly. If you are going to elect oneperson to play the role of Isis, a nice addition might to have that personrecite one of Crowley’s better poetic works, Isis am I, at the climax of theritual; either before or after generating the oracle or blessing the people. Ifthe person playing Isis can learn the poem by heart, it might make sense to havethem recite it immediately after the last litany, at the moment of supremepossession; otherwise it might be better to have them read it a little whilelater, after the work of the goddess is done.Invocation Of The Holy Spirit (Isis)Participants: Minimum two, though four would be better.

The object> of them is almost invariably the invocation of a God, that God conceived in a> more or less material and personal fashion. These Rituals are therefore well> suited for such persons as are capable of understanding the spirit of Magick> as opposed to the letter.- Aleister Crowley, MagickThis rite first appeared in The Equinox Vol I, Number 10 in 1913 as one of twopieces under the heading of Two Fragments of Ritual. An introductory note givesit as being a translation of an ancient German manuscript found amongst thepapers of Adam Weishaupt, founder of the Illuminati. This is a typical AleisterCrowley joke - it’s fairly obvious that both rituals were actually written byCrowley himself.This particular ritual is supposedly to invoke HICE, which is the Coptic form ofthe Egyptian goddess Isis. As you can see from the previous chapters Crowleyclearly enjoyed invoking this particular deity. However in this case the ritualis presented in the form of a dramatic presentation for three performers whobetween them play several Egyptian gods, and enact a variation of an Egyptianmyth cycle in which Typhon and Apophis conspire to kill Osiris, who the goddessIsis then brings back to life in the person of their child Horus, who in turnseeks to avenge his father’s death. As such, I think the title of the ritual isextremely misleading - it’s not just Isis or HICE that is being invoked here,but an entire pantheon of Egyptian deities.Apophis, or Apep, is the Egyptian serpent demon of destruction, who lived in theUnderworld and attacked and swallowed the sun every night, using his hypnoticgaze to paralyse his victims. Typhon was a similar Greek demon, a destructivemonster with a hundred serpent heads, whose eyes dripped venom, and mouthsbreathed red-hot lava. Isis was the mother goddess, whose name means literally“She of the Throne”; she is a goddess of nature, caring, and wisdom. Isis wasmarried to her brother Osiris, Lord of the Dead (sister/brother relationshipsare common in divine pantheons all over the world). Osiris was also the god ofthe grain, which is planted in the dark ground in winter and springs up aliveagain later. Horus was the hawk-headed child of Isis and Osiris, a strongwarlike deity who was brought up to avenge the death of his father.This whole ritual is of the nature of a “passion play” - the symbolicre-enactment of a primal myth of the gods. As such, it hearkens back to anearlier tradition in ancient Egypt, where the temples of Osiris would perform asimilar re-enactment of this story starting around November 13th, the day thatgrain was planted. This tradition later inspired the Christian Passion Play,which is a dramatic re-enactment of the death and rebirth of Jesus, put on byearly Christians as a way of bringing the story of Christ to the common people.So in this ritual we have the foundation for a Thelemic Passion Play which couldbe performed as a public celebratory rite, perhaps as an Equinox or Solsticecelebration. If your group has the opportunity to put on a Thelemic working forthe public (perhaps at a pagan meeting, alternative religious convention, orsomething similar), this ritual is well worth considering.The original title of the ritual says that it can be used to invoke “any otherdivine one”. I suppose in the sense that the rite refers to the solar death andrebirth myth it is a common background story, but calling it a rite to invokeany divine one is pushing it a bit. Crowley was very much influenced bypioneering anthropologist J.G. Frazer’s massive twelve volume study ofcomparative religion The Golden Bough (even going so far as to write acollection of short stories based on it called Golden Twigs). It containedFrazer’s theory that the myth of the dying and resurrected solar god was auniversal one shared across many cultures in slightly varying forms. Althoughthere is some surface veracity in it, most modern scholars agree that Frazer’stheory isn’t really that universal outside of a relatively small culturalregion, and that even then he may have interpreted things in a rather loosemanner to fit his theory (a problem that Crowley himself sometimes suffered from- as do we all). So rather than this being a universal ritual as such, I see itas being very specifically based on the Isis/Osiris/Horus story. That the myththat lies behind it is one that resonates strongly with many people is a bonuspoint.The ritual is a lot simpler to learn and stage than some of Crowley’s othermystic dramas such as The Rites of Eleusis or The Ship. In comparison to thoseit’s a fairly short ritual with relatively few lines and a small cast - which isquite remarkable considering the excessive wordiness of some of Crowley’searlier attempts at portraying the solar death and rebirth myth. The story toldis quite easy to follow even for someone with no prior knowledge of Thelema ormagick. In this we may see an evolution of Crowley’s thought away from thecomplex, dense poetry of his youth to a more mature and simplified form. InMagick, published sixteen years later, he would write:> ...the story of the God should be dramatised by a well-skilled poet accustomed> to this form of composition. Lengthy speeches and invocations should be> avoided, but action should be very full.In the original rite printed in The Equinox the three principal players werereferred to by different titles than I have used here. The original titles werefar too confusing and played no real purpose in the ritual at all. Instead Ihave used the titles of First Adept, Second Adept, and Third Adept, and added inbrackets which god they are playing at each point in the ritual, which makes therite much easier to understand and perform. Also for the sake of clarity I havereformatted the opening sequence, which made no logical sense in the originalversion.First Adept plays the roles of Apophis and Isis, and is thus ideally taken by awoman. Second Adept plays Typhon and is probably best done by a man. Third Adeptplays Osiris and Horus and thus is also best played by a male.The ritual specifies lots of striking of the Third Adept with a rod and ascourge (i.e. a wooden cane and a whip) - please take care to not actually hurtanyone. In particular, please bear in mind that in some countries it is illegalto beat or whip someone in any way that leaves a mark or breaks the skin even ifthe other person fully consents to the beating. Remember that you are acting outthe role of gods, you’re not actually literally supposed to be doing the thingsmentioned in the text.

Arise in the duskFrom thy chamber of mystery and musk!Come with me, though weary the way,To bring back his life to the rended clay!See! are not these the hands that woveDelight, and these the arms that stroveWith me? And these the feet, the thighsThat were lovely in mine eyes?Lo! I lament. I gather in my carThine head, Asar.And this—is this not the trunk he rended?But—oh! oh! oh!—the task transcended,Where is the holy idol that stoodFor the god of thy queen’s beatitude?Here is the tent—but where is the pole?Here is the body—but where is the soul?Nepti, sister, the work is undoneFor lack of the needed One!Lo! I lament.

It was originallywritten by one of the early Thelemites, Howard E. White (Frater Ad Alta), underthe direction of Charles Stansfield Jones (Frater Achad), and had its premierepublic performance at the Vancouver Labour Temple, November 27th, 1914, withJones as Magus and White as Assistant Magus. The performance was an attempt toincrease interest in British Columbia Lodge No. 1, the first O.T.O. body to beestablished in North America. Apparently it was successful, for they put on asecond performance in June of the next year, selling fifty-five tickets.I say the ritual is non-Crowleyan, but perhaps that’s pushing it a bit, sincemuch of it was clearly inspired by and derived from Crowley’s own work - so notsurprisingly when they sent it to Crowley for his opinion he was apparently muchimpressed, replying to Jones:> I am more than pleased at your letter just received with ritual enclosed. It> is very fine. Mr. White is to be congratulated heartily; no criticism seems> necessary. I hope you will arrange to repeat this all the time, say every new> moon or every full moon, so as to build up a regular force. You should also> have a solar ritual to balance it, to be done at each time the Sun enters a> new sign, with special festivity at the Equinoxes and solstices.> In this way you can establish a regular cult; and if you do them in a truly> magical manner, you create a vortex of force which will suck in all the people> you want. The time is just ripe for a natural religion. People like rites and> ceremonies, and they are tired of hypothetical gods. Insist on the real> benefits of the Sun, the Mother-force, the Father-force, and so on, and show> that by celebrating these benefits worthily the worshippers unite themselves> more fully with the current of life. Let the religion be Joy, but with a> worthy and dignified sorrow in death itself, and treat death as an ordeal, an> initiation... In short, be the founder of a new and greater Pagan cult.We can see from this that Crowley envisioned O.T.O. bodies to be performing atleast two major rituals a month: one lunar and one solar. From my own experiencein running magical groups I think this is a pretty good target to aim at. Havinga fairly sizable ritual every fortnight or so means you don’t have too much timepressure on a small group, yet means that you also don’t have too long a periodwith people sitting around with nothing to do. If you want to follow thisschedule you could use one or more of the Isis rituals given in the last fewchapters for your lunar rites, and have the Invocation of Horus, The Bacchanal(see Chapter 7), or perhaps the Gnostic Mass as your solar rites.A large chunk of the middle section of this ritual is derived from the “Cancer”section of Liber 963: The Treasure House of Images by J.F.C Fuller from TheEquinox Vol 1, 3, split up for three part working. Fuller was a British Armyofficer and one of the very first Thelemites, later to achieve fame as an experton mechanised warfare, and supposedly inventor of the Blitzkrieg system used tonotable effect by the German military in the 1930s. Much to Crowley’s chagrin wecan assume, since Crowley detested the Nazis with a passion.Another part that is certainly not by Aleister Crowley is the use of Ave Marianear the climax of the ritual. Some people, especially those from a RomanCatholic background, might find this odd in a Rite of Isis; but it isn’t really,since so much of Marian iconography is directly taken from Isis worship.Historian Will Durant wrote in his monumental The Story of Civilization:> Early Christians sometimes worshiped before the statues of Isis suckling the> infant Horus, seeing in them another form of the ancient and noble myth by> which woman (i.e., the female principle), creating all things, becomes at last> the Mother of God.Since the Christians stole the Mother Goddess in the first place in order tocreate the myth of Mary, Queen of Heaven, I think it only fitting that we borrowher back now and again. Quite apart from that, there are several lovely musicalsettings of this prayer that can be used to add atmosphere to the ritual,perhaps the most famous of which is that by Charles Gounod, who set the prayerto music from Bach’s Well Tempered Clavier.The original opening of this ritual is very much based on the Golden Dawn styleof working, as transmitted by Crowley through the pages of the early numbers ofThe Equinox, the magical journal he had been publishing for several years.However by 1914 Crowley himself was already beginning to move away from thisstyle of ritual towards a less wordy, more ecstatic approach based on poetry andmusic, and the main body of the ritual is more closely modelled on that style,featuring excerpts from several different poems by Crowley.Evidence suggests that Jones and White were never really happy with the originalopening, as it was rewritten three times. The one reproduced here is based onthe second version, which according to Crowley archivist Gerald Yorke waswritten by Crowley as a replacement for the first opening that White hadwritten. I think this unlikely, it just doesn’t sound like the kind of thingCrowley would have written at this period of his life, when he had pretty muchabandoned the Golden Dawn style of ritual working that this opening is based on.Also since he had written to Jones that “no criticism seems necessary” it wouldseem pretty illogical to then go on to rewrite the entire opening! I think itmuch more likely that this second opening was written by Jones (possibly inconjunction with White) since the original typescript has Jones’ handwrittennotes all over it, and it reads more like it was written by someone who had beenfollowing Crowley’s writing in The Equinox slavishly.Regardless of who actually wrote it, and how much editing was done on it,somewhere in the whole process confusion crept in, because the temple directionsas given in the opening became completely reversed compared to the setup in themain body of the ritual, leading to a fairly unworkable mess if you try to dothe rite as written. Consequently I’ve had to edit it again to sort out thedirections, so the “original” opening as given here is actually slightlydifferent to the version in the typescript.This opening is quite complex and features not only both the entire LesserPentagram and Hexagram rituals, but also some extra Fire and Spirit pentagramsthrown in for good measure. The Golden Dawn made much of these different typesof pentagrams and hexagrams for different purposes, but to be honest I find themcompletely extraneous and rather contrived. However if you wish to use theserituals and symbols as written, be my guest - the full original Lesser ritualsof the Pentagram and Hexagram are reproduced in the Appendix to this book.Personally I haven’t used any of this Golden Dawn derived stuff in decades, andI’ve never missed it.Another problem with the original opening is that it is stylistically verydifferent than the main body of the rite. The opening is based on Biblicaldivine and angelic names, and sonorous King James Version speeches, whereas themain section is very pagan and poetic. Consequently I’ve written a RevisedOpening (yes, a fourth version!) that I hope is a little more focused andharmonises better with the main ritual text – and more closely follows Crowley’sinjunction to concentrate on the pagan aspects. It also has the additionalbenefit of being much shorter and simpler - the main ritual already has plentyof text and action, so I think the whole operation benefits from having asimplified opening, especially for public performance.Whether or not the ritual is really suitable for public performance is debatableI think. It certainly has a lot going on within it, but may be a littlelong-winded to really keep people’s attention focused, especially if the openingis performed as written - Pentagram rituals don’t tend to work very well in apublic setting. I would definitely recommend that you use the Revised Opening inpublic, and omit the optional Pentagram part.However despite originally being a bit overburdened with formalities the ritualis quite beautiful, and certainly recommended if your group wants to get theirteeth into a bigger, more complex working.Note that the original piece was written for three specific male Officers ofB.C. Lodge No. 1 playing the Magi. In the interest of preserving historicalaccuracy I have left the text with male pronouns in place, but of course infuture performances any or all of the Officers may be played by women; in whichcase simply change the pronouns to suit.The ritual specifies that the officers should each wear a Nemmes. This is theclassic Egyptian headdress so beloved of the Golden Dawn rites. If you’re notsure how to make one, have a look round the Internet for instructions, or simplydo without, it’s not essential.A Rite of IsisParticipants: Minimum four.Time required: About an hourSetup: Relatively complexWords: A lotEquipment:• Magus• White and gold robe• Nemmes (optional)• Bowl of consecrated water• Assistant Magus• White robe• Nemmes (optional)• Magus of Fire:• Black robe, with red triangle upon the breast(or just plain black)• Lighted candle• Soror Luna• White robe or Egyptian dress• Altar with• Statue of Isis• Four candles, unlit at start• Blue lamp• Bell• North and South small altars each having a candle• Altar of Incense with• Three candles, unlit at start• Censer, charcoal & incense• Musician or music playback system• Veil in the Eastern part of the temple (optional)Original OpeningIn the East is the Altar having upon it a statue of Isis and four candles, andabove it a blue lamp burning.

Since that time however his worship has beenlargely forgotten. However he is mentioned in a Thelemic context in severalplaces in the works of Aleister Crowley, most notably in the Gnostic Mass, wherethe Priest invokes him in the words “Kurie Meithras” (Lord Mithras). In hisConfessions Crowley describes a conversation with the discarnate wizardAmalantrah about the true derivation of Baphomet:> I had taken the name Baphomet as my motto in the O.T.O. For six years and more> I had tried to discover the proper way to spell this name. I knew that it must> have eight letters, and also that the numerical and literal correspondences> must be such as to express the meaning of the name in such a ways as to> confirm what scholarship had found out about it, and also to clear up those> problems which archaeologists had so far failed to solve. Here, then, was an> ideal test of the integrity and capacity of the Camel’s Wizard. I flung the> question in his face. “If you possess the superior knowledge which you claim,> you can tell me how to spell Baphomet!” The Camel knew nothing of the Hebrew> and little of the Greek. She had no idea that a conventional system existed by> which one could check the accuracy of any given orthography. Her Wizard> answered my question without hesitation. “Wrong,” said I, “there must be eight> letters.” “True,” he answered, “there is an R at the end.” The answer struck> me in the midriff. One theory of the name is that it represents the words Beta> alpha phi eta mu eta tau epsilon omicron sigma, the baptism of wisdom;> another, that it is a corruption of a title meaning “Father Mithras”. Needless> to say, the suffix R supported the latter theory. I added up the word as spelt> by the Wizard. It totalled 729. This number had never appeared in my> Cabbalistic working and therefore meant nothing to me. It however justified> itself as being the cube of nine. The word chi eta phi alpha sigma, the mystic> title given by Christ to Peter as the cornerstone of the Church, has this same> value. So far, the Wizard had shown great qualities! He had cleared up the> etymological problem and shown why the Templars should have given the name> Baphomet to their so-called idol. Baphomet was Father Mithras, the cubical> stone which was the corner of the Temple.(The Camel mentioned in the text was Roddie Minor, a girlfriend of Crowley’s whohad contacted Amalantrah via mediumship in 1918.)We can thus see that Mithras plays an important background role in the Thelemiccanon, particularly in relationship to O.T.O. So although the following ritualwas not written by Aleister Crowley (it pre-dates him by a couple of thousandyears) I think that any Thelemic group performing it will find that it fits inextremely well with our magical current.Although widespread across the Roman Empire, the worship of Mithras appears tohave emerged in Persia sometime between 2000 BCE and 1 CE. We know that itsurvived there after the fall of the Roman Empire (Mithraic festivals were stillbeing held in Iran up until the 20th century), so one plausible explanation forthe connection of Mithras and Baphomet is that when the Templars basedthemselves in the Middle East during the Crusades they stumbled upon, and wereinfluenced by, a surviving cult of Mithras. Mithraism was a religion that wastraditionally practised by soldiers, since Mithras was a deity of victory andconquest whose initiates were male only, so it certainly would have beenattractive to a group of warrior-monks far from home and sworn not to touchwomen.Thanks to the success of the Roman Empire’s military there are manywell-preserved temples to Mithras still around today. Thus we have a fairly goodidea of how original Mithraic temples were laid out. I think it very useful totry to recreate this temple layout wherever possible. The Mithras creation mythstates that he was born inside a rock (which was actually the cosmos, as seenfrom outside), and Mithraic temples or Mithraeums (or Mithrea) were thustraditionally built inside caves or underground cellars, though a windowlessroom could also be used. Mithraeums weren’t traditionally very large, usuallyonly about 25 metres by 10 metres, and holding about 20-30 initiates at a time -so even a large modern living room could be turned into a reasonable facsimileof a Mithraeum.The temple should be quite dark, perhaps with just a few candles or very lowambient lighting. The interior of the temple is a rectangular room with an altarset up at one end (the “East” of the temple), with benches running down each ofthe two long sides for the worshippers to sit or recline on. There should alsobe tables containing wheat, bread, beer, “bull’s blood” wine, or othertraditional foodstuffs sacred to Mithras. Also set up in the East should be animage of Mithras, known as the Tauroctony. There is a very formalised depictionof Mithras found in his temples all over the world, where the god is slaying abull surrounded by various holy animals. See the illustration for details. EveryMithraic temple should feature a version of this image, either as a statue or asa two-dimensional reproduction.[images/00035.jpg]The Tauroctony depicts the central mystery of Mithras. The god Ahura Mazda senta raven to Mithras to order him to kill the sacred bull. Mithras was reluctantto do so, but knew he must comply, hence in this scene of slaying Mithras isalways shown as having his head averted from the killing he is doing. Recentstudies have shown that a desire to kill other men is quite rare in most humans,and in the past it was extremely difficult to get soldiers to kill people inconflict with this basic reluctance (that’s why the military spends so much timeand energy training soldiers to follow orders). So the portrayal of Mithras’reluctance to kill may have had a strong resonance with the soldiers who invokedhim. From the sacrificed bull’s body grew useful plants & herbs, from its bloodcame the vine, and from its semen came all useful animals - hence in manyTauroctonies the bull’s wound has leaves or grain coming out of it.To either side of Mithras there are two other humanoid figures - Cautes andCautopates, who carry torches, one held aloft, the other pointing down, whorepresent the sunrise and the sunset. Although Mithras used to be generallythought of as a solar deity, he’s not at all - he’s a starry deity who manifestson Earth using the energy of our sun. You can see this by looking inside thecape of Mithras, which depicts the night sky, specifically the constellation ofPerseus. It seems likely that one of the hidden teachings of the Mithraic cultwas that Mithras was thought to inhabit this constellation, “the secret sunbehind the sun”.The animals portrayed in the scene are representations of other starconstellations. The bull itself is Taurus, who is being attacked by the Dog(Canis Minor), the Snake (Hydra), the Scorpion (Scorpio), and the Raven(Corvus). Also frequently shown are a lion and a cup, representing Leo andAquarius, which were the signs at the solstices during the Age of Taurus. Fewpeople realise that because of a “wobble” in the Earth’s orbit, the positions ofthe stars in the sky change (over a very long period of time admittedly). Thisis known as the Precession of the Equinoxes, and astrologically is seen asheralding huge changes in society and the human race. The last few astrologicalperiods like this were:• Age of Cancer (ca. 8600 BCE - 6450 BCE): domestication• Age of Gemini (ca. 6450 BCE - 4300 BCE): invention of writing, trade• Age of Taurus (ca. 4300 BCE - 2150 BCE): Ancient Egypt and pyramids, bullworship• Age of Aries (ca. 2150 BCE - 1 CE): Iron Age, solar cults• Age of Pisces (ca. 1 CE - present day): Christianity, IslamWe know that Mithraism started sometime after 2000 CE, at the end of the Age ofTaurus, the sign of the bull, so the Tauroctony, or slaying of the bull, maywell have begun as a myth dealing with the change from the age of bull worshipto the Age of Aries, with its emphasis on fire, iron, and the power of thevirile sun (symbolised by the sword which Mithas carries to slay the bull). It’scertainly fairly obvious that the astronomy (and astrology, which was the samething back then) played a very large role in Mithraic belief.Today we are once more in the midst of a great change in astrological Age, as weenter the Age of Aquarius, and overthrow the patriarchal monotheistic beliefs ofthe Piscean Age. Mithras is thus an excellent god for Thelemites to invoke, inhis role as the destroyer of the outmoded ways of the past Age, and the bringerin of the New Age. Also Mithras is a god of the stars, and our religion is onewhere stars play a primary role. “Every man and every woman is a star” afterall. Perhaps it’s time for a new Aquarian Tauroctony, where Mithras slays not abull, but a fish?Mithraism was a mystery religion, in which the secrets were gradually giventhrough a graded system of initiation (similar to the modern-day O.T.O. forexample). There were seven Degrees of initiation, the first four of which wereopen to everyone, the latter three by special invitation only. These Degreeswere:1. Corax (Raven - Mercury)2. Nymphus (Bridegroom - Venus)3. Miles (Soldier - Mars)4. Leo (Lion - Jupiter)5. Perseus (Persian - Moon)6. Heliodromus (Sun-courier - Sun)7. Pater (Father - Saturn)[images/00021.jpg]The symbols of each Degree were often painted on the floor of the Mithraeum, inthe form of a ladder that the initiates must “ascend”. At each initiation thecandidate would have to undergo ordeals, based on cold, heat, and fasting. Fewdetails of these rites have come down to us, but we do know that at least oneritual (possibly that of Corax) included the Pater of the temple firing a bow ata rock, recreating the “water miracle” of Mithras when he made water flow from arock in this manner. We can assume that during this rite the candidate wasbaptised with water, especially since every temple of Mithras had a well orsacred spring near the doorway at the West end.Augustine, writing at the end of the fourth century, also mentions the use ofwater in Mithraic initiation:> “But what kind of play is that which is played for them in the Cave with> veiled eyes? For they have their eyes veiled... Some like birds flap their> wings imitating the cry of ravens; others again roar like lions; while others> with hands bound with the entrails of fowls are made to leap over trenches> filled with water, and then some one comes and severs the bond, and calls> himself their liberator.”The binding of the hands with bird entrails again might be a reference to theCorax rite of initiation, since in many initiatory systems the candidates’ firstentrance to the temple is with their hands bound.Tertullian in his work On the Crown, written about 210 CE, talks about Soldiersof Mithras:> “For when this Soldier is initiated in the Cave - in the Camp of Darkness as> may well be said - and a crown is offered him at the sword’s point - as though> it were a mimicry of martyrdom - and then placed on his head, he is bidden to> put up his hand and change it from his head to, it may be, his shoulder,> declaring that Mithra is his Crown.> And henceforth he never allows a crown or wreath to be put on him; and this he> has as a mark whereby to prove himself, if on any occasion he should be tried> concerning his mystery; immediately he is recognised as a Soldier of Mithra,> if he cast down the crown, and declare that his Crown is his God.”I assume this to be a reference to the third degree of initiation, that ofMiles, the Soldier.We also know that in the initiation to the Degree of Leo the candidate was notbaptised with water, but with honey (since water was not fitting in such a“fiery” Degree), and honey was placed in the initiate’s mouth to symbolise pureand cleansing words.The classical pagan philosopher Porphyry writes:> The theologers have used ‘honey’ in many different symbolic ways owing to its> being a same deduced from many powers, and especially because it has both a> purifying and preservative virtue; for by honey many things are preserved from> decay, and with honey long open wounds are purified. Moreover it is sweet to> taste, and collected from ‘flowers’ by ‘bees’ who happen to be ‘ox-born.’> When, therefore, they pour into the hands of those who are receiving the> Leontic initiation, honey for washing instead of water, they bid them keep> their hands pure from everything that causes pain or harm, or brings> defilement; just as when the purifying medium is fire, they bring the> candidate appropriate means of washing, declining water as inimical to fire.> > Moreover it is with honey too they purify their tongues from every sin.> > Further, when they bring honey to the Persian, as to the ‘Keeper of the> Fruits,’ they symbolically signify the power of keeping or preserving.The “Persian” here being the Degree above that of the Leo - this last line mayrefer to part of the initiation of that Degree, or to a ritual act performed tothat officer during other rites.Porphyry goes on to quote Eubulus who states that the highest initiates in theMithraic religion were apparently vegetarians, and that they believed inreincarnation of souls:> The first and most highly trained of them neither eat nor kill anything> possessed of soul, but adhere to the ancient rule of abstinence from animals.> The second use flesh, but do not slay tame creatures. While the third though> they eat domesticated animals do not use all of them as do the rest of the> people.> For the chief doctrine of all of them is that of metempsychosis. And this they> also seem to make clear in the Mysteries of Mithra; for they are accustomed to> indicate us that is the grade or nature to which we belong by means of animal> forms, thus mystically symbolizing the nature which we have in common with the> animals.> > Thus they call the initiates who take part in the actual rites Lions…, and the> subordinates Ravens. In the case of the Fathers moreover the same symbolism is> used, for they are called Eagles and Hawks.> These are the distinguishing marks of the three great grades; in addition, he> who receives the initiations in the Lion-grade is dressed in many> animal-forms.Note that the seven Degrees of Mithraism are here divided into “three greatgrades”. The first of these grades would appear to contain the I°-III°, thesecond grade contain the next three Degrees, starting with the Leo Degree, andthe final grade be composed of the Fathers of the temples.Apart from the above, we have little evidence of what actually occurred in aMithraeum. One notable exception is a work published in the late 19th century bynoted occultist, translator, and writer G.R.S. Mead under the title A MithraicRitual. The work itself was discovered in the Paris Magic Papyrus 574(Supplement grec de la Bibliotheque nationale), and is thought to date from the4th century, although it appears that it may have originated as early as 100-150CE. It is of Egyptian origin, most likely from a temple at Thebes. As such itcontains Egyptian magical themes as well as Mithraic ones, and seems to be acombination of the two currents. How much of it is Mithaic and how much Egyptianis still a matter of some academic dispute, but for our purposes it works, andthat’s enough.Mead’s introduction to the ritual states:> ...the most likely supposition is that we have before us (when the latter> insertions are removed) a Ritual translated or paraphrased into Greek, and> adapted for use in Egypt, and that, too, for picked members of the most> esoteric circles. For our Ritual is not for the initiation of a neophyte of> the lower grades, but for a candidate who is to self-initiate himself in the> solitary mystery of apotheosis, whereby he became a true “Father” of the> inmost rites, one possessing face to face knowledge and gnosis.> ...It is exceedingly probable, therefore, that we have in this Ritual of> initiation certain theurgic practices of Egyptian tradition combined with the> traditional Mithraic invocations done into Greek.Although G.R.S. Mead gives this as a solo self-initiation ritual I think this isunlikely. The cult of Mithras was a mystery religion in which candidates wereled to initiation by those already of higher Degrees in the system. It’s verypossible that this was a ritual of initiation to one of the higher Degrees(perhaps Heliodromus or even Pater), or it may well have been some kind ofmeditative rite performed in the presence of the whole temple.The ritual as written contains a great deal of instruction as to what should bevisualised during its performance. There are many of these visualisations and itseems likely that the participant(s) may have been guided through them by theFather of the Temple or a ritual assistant. Accordingly I have adapted this workto serve as a group ritual, which is the way I think it may have been designedoriginally.I have recreated it with three parts: Pater, Postulant, and People.The Pater isthe Father of the Temple (this could be changed to Mater if the part is beingperformed by a woman), and serves to introduce the ritual working and guide theparticipants in visualisation; the Postulant does most of the direct invocationof Mithras; and the People back this up with sounds and chanting to energise theworking. When there are only two people performing the rite the Postulant mayalso perform the parts given to the People. As a solo rite it could be performedwithout the Pater’s speech at all, if the solo celebrant either reads ormemorises the visualisations and performs them in the appropriate places.However I strongly recommend at least three people in this working, and it couldbe successfully used with a group as large as thirty.Note that the personal pronouns used in the ritual are male, but don’t have tobe: Son may be changed to Daughter etc. where appropriate.In several places in the ritual unarticulated sounds are made, which in theoriginal Greek text are described as surigmoj and poppusmoj. The closest Englishtranslations are hissings and poppings. According to Mead:> The first denotes a shrill piping sound or hissing, the Latin stridor. It is> used of such different sounds as the rattling of ropes, the trumpeting of> elephants and a singing in the ears.> The second is used of a clicking or clucking with the lips and tongue, and of> the whistling, cheeping, chirruping, warbling or trilling of birds. It is used> of the smack of a loud kiss and also of the cry “hush.” Both Aristophanes and> Pliny tell us that it was used as a protection against, or rather a reverent> greeting of, lightning; and the latter adds that this was a universal custom.Basically it would appear that by surigmoj they were attempting to explain whatwe would now call white noise; and by poppusmoj some kind of clicking with thetongue or smacking of the lips as is used by certain African languages.Participants will have to work out for themselves how best to recreate theseduring the rite. In the text I have rendered the hissing with a triple S (asdoes Mead) and the popping as a triple P.The text mentions amulets, which were very important in classical magick, and itis recommended that the participants either create or bring amulets to be usedand thus consecrated during the rite. Also percussion, particularly of ametallic or booming nature might come in handy. Gongs, sistrums, or cowbells ofgold, brass, iron, or steel would be perfect, as well as large drums preferablywith animal skin heads (both to get that primeval atmosphere, and as“sacrifices” to Mithras).A Mithraic LiturgyParticipants: 3-30Time required: An hour or so to perform.Setup: Fairly simple, though can be made more complex if desired - see notes onthe traditional Mithraic temple design.Words: Quite a lot.Equipment:• Percussion instruments or other noise-making items• Food & drink• Amulet (preferably each person attending should bring one of these)• TauroctonyThe Father’s PrayerPater: O Providence, O Fortune, bestow on me Thy Grace - imparting these theMysteries a Father only may hand on, and that, too, to a Son alone - hisImmortality - a Son initiate, worthy of this our Craft, with which Sun Mithras,the Great God, commanded me to be endowed by His Archangel; so that I, Eagle asI am, by mine own self alone, may soar to Heaven, and contemplate all things.The Invocatory Utterance (Logos)Postulant: O Primal Origin of my origination; Thou Primal Substance of mysubstance; First Breath of breath, the breath that is in me; First Fire,God-given for the Blending of the blendings in me, First Fire of fire in me;First Water of my water, the water in me; Primal Earth-essence of the earthyessence in me; Thou Perfect Body of me - N.N. son of N.N.

For thou shalt see as though it were a Pipedepending from His Disk; and toward the regions Westward, as though it were aninfinite East Wind. But if the other Wind, toward the regions of the East shouldbe in service, in the like fashion shalt thou see, toward the regions of thatside, the converse of the sight.And thou shalt see the Gods gazing intently on thee and bearing down upon thee.Then straightway lay thy dexter finger on thy lips and say:The First UtterancePater: Silence!

The Bacchae of Euripides is a magnificent example of such a Ritual; so> also, though in a less degree, is the Mass.- Aleister Crowley, MagickWe have seen in the preceding chapter how the two thousand year old religion ofMithraism became one of the antecedents to the work we are doing today, but it’sfar from the only example. Although Thelema is one of the most modern religionsaround, its roots are from many cultures and mysteries. One of the beauties ofour system is that we have this incredibly varied history that has been passeddown to us, and that we can still connect to and draw from today. So here isanother of our magical roots - the Bacchanal.The Bacchanalia were originally annual festivals held to celebrate theGraeco-Roman god Bacchus, and (in contrast to the Mithraic religion) wereoriginally a secret mystery cult almost entirely composed of women. Over timethey became so popular that they were held several times a month, and men wereeventually admitted also, though frequently only if they dressed as women. Theywere characterised by liberal consumption of wine, accompanied by dancing andchanting: wine, women, and song taken to its ultimate extreme. In many ways notunlike a modern day rave or rock festival - except these were a lot moreextreme. People who think that the youth of today are much more wild anduninhibited than their forebears have a lot to learn about history.Yet the Bacchanal was not just about getting drunk and having a good time - itwas about loosing the artificial boundaries of everyday life and returning to aprimal state where we can reconnect ourselves with the natural world around us.In that sense these were deeply spiritual practices, with a strongtransformatory effect on those who participated. Also there were practicalmagical effects too, for as the playwright Euripides wrote:> This god too hath prophetic power, for there is no small prophecy inspired by> Bacchic frenzy; for whenever the god in his full might enters the human frame,> he makes his frantic votaries foretell the future. Likewise he hath some share> in Ares’ rights; for oft, or ever a weapon is touched, a panic seizes an army> when it is marshalled in array; and this too is a frenzy sent by Dionysus.[The Bacchantes / Euripides; translated by Edward P. Coleridge, 1891.]So who was Bacchus (or Dionysus as he was often known), this god who could causeordinary housewives to desert their families and revel in the woods by night?Mythologically he was the son of the God Zeus, though according to some accountshe had two mothers: the first being Persephone, Queen of the Underworld. Afterhis birth to her he was torn apart by Titans, who left nothing but his heart;Zeus then blasted the Titans into ash, which he mixed with the flesh of Dionysusto create the human race. Humans thus partake of both natures, that of thedivine Dionysus, and the material Titans.Zeus then implanted the heart of Dionysus into the womb of the mortal womanSemele, who bore him, giving him his title of Dithyrambos, or twice-born. Afterthat he was hidden in Zeus’ thigh for a while to keep him safe, and then raisedby woodland nymphs. (It should be noted that “thigh” was often used in earliertimes as a euphemism for another prominent part of the male anatomy). Perhapsunsurprisingly, he was a disturbed child. He wandered the Mediterranean regionfor some time in madness, until he came to Phrygia (modern-day Turkey), where hewas “cured” by his grandmother Cybele. After that he was just prone toandrogyny, random acts of violence and slaying, continual drunkenness, andleading masses of people to desert their families to follow him into wantonrevelling and the killing and dismembering of wild animals; so obviously thecure worked.Bacchus had a great affinity with trees and fruit, and while on his travelsdiscovered how to cultivate vines and create wine, and for this invention he wasjustly celebrated far and wide. Farmers would pray to him for a good harvest,and his earliest shrines seem to have been representations of his image carvedinto sacred trees. Also on his travels he met and married Ariadne, daughter ofKing Minos of Crete (whose famous thread had led Theseus through the Labyrinth).He topped this off by then descending to the Underworld and rescuing his mother,to give her a good retirement among the gods on Mount Olympus. And so the wildyouth became the noble family man, as so many do.We can see the classic death and rebirth theme in the life of Dionysus - notonly is he killed and returned to life, but he later goes to the Underworld andbrings his mother out of death. Although it might be tempting to see this as asolar myth, it may be more accurate to see it as the life-cycle of the crops,which die in Winter to fertilise the land and be renewed in Spring. In thissense there are parallels to the life of Osiris, also a god of vegetation whowas dismembered and reborn. And of course, the later myth of Jesus of Nazareth,who was also supposedly killed, went to the Underworld, and was reborn. It seemslikely that much of the myth of Jesus was actually derived from that of Bacchus.Aleister Crowley wrote in Chapter 7 of The Book of Lies:> The legend of ‘Christ’ is only a corruption and perversion of other legends.> Especially of Dionysus: compare the account of Christ before Herod/Pilate in> the Gospels, and of Dionysus before Pentheus in ‘The Bacchae’.And in Magick, chapter 1:> ...the identity of this legend with the course of Nature, its madness, its> prodigality, its intoxication, its joy, and above all its sublime persistence> through the cycles of Life and Death. The pagan reader must labour to> understand this in Pater’s “Greek Studies”, and the Christian reader will> recognise it, incident for incident, in the story of Christ. This legend is> but the dramatization of Spring.> The magician who wishes to invoke Bacchus by this method must therefore> arrange a ceremony in which he takes the part of Bacchus, undergoes all His> trials, and emerges triumphant from beyond death. He must, however, be warned> against mistaking the symbolism. In this case, for example, the doctrine of> individual immortality has been dragged in, to the destruction of truth. It is> not that utterly worthless part of man, his individual consciousness as John> Smith, which defies death - that consciousness which dies and is reborn in> every thought. That which persists (if anything persist) is his real John> Smithiness, a quality of which he was probably never conscious in his life.The myth of Dionysus was originally celebrated in two festivals, one rural andone urban. The rural festival was celebrated around the Winter Solstice, whereasthe city celebrations where held around the Spring Equinox. The main public ritewas the pompe, or procession, in which the worshippers carried carved images ofthe phallus, long loaves of bread, jars of water and jars of wine. Then wouldcome dancing and singing, and choruses would perform ‘Dithyrambs’, hymns aboutthe life of Dionysus sung by a chorus of up to fifty people dancing in circles.These often took a call and response style, with the chorus leader taking on themain role and the rest of the chorus following.The Bacchantes loved music of all sorts, and used an incredible variety ofinstruments, especially drums, cymbals, and flutes. Basically if it could make anoise and you could dance to it, it was in. They also liked to clothe themselvesin whatever they found in the woodlands. Deer skins, goat skins, and bull’shides were a favorite, and easily obtained, since the revellers also liked totear any deer, goats and bulls they came across apart with their bare hands andeat the raw flesh as a way of getting closer to the spirit of Dionysus. Theyalso wove crowns of ivy and bindweed for themselves, and each carried a stavetopped with a pine-cone, called a Thyrsus.The Thyrsus was traditionally made from the hollow stalk of the giant fennelplant, or ferula. The asafoetida variety of giant fennel grows up to 2 metrestall, which gives an idea of possible length of the Thyrsus, and 5-8 centimetreswide; since it was also hollow it would thus make a low resonant sound whenbanged on the floor. Asafoetida is closely related to the now extinct variety ofgiant fennel Silphium, an important medicinal plant in ancient times, and whichmay have been the one originally used in the Bacchanal.A giant fennel stalk was also used by Prometheus to bring down fire from heavento assist the evolution of mankind. This is referenced in the Gnostic Mass, inthe Priest’s Anthem:> Thou, the true fire within the reed> Brooding and breeding, source and seed> Of life, love, liberty, and lightIf you want to make your own Thyrsus and can’t get hold of a giant fennel stalk,perhaps thick bamboo would be a good substitute.Obviously there is a phallic reference in the Thyrsus, the hollow reed toppedwith the pine cone representing male fertility. Also pine cones with seeds stillin will rattle like a shaker (similar to poles with bottle tops nailed to themthat modern-day Morris Dancers use). Sometimes the pine cones at the top werealso filled with honey, which would run down the shaft during the rites (perhapsnot a good idea if you’re doing this indoors...).Crowley depicted Dionysus on the card of the The Fool in his Tarot pack, andwrote in The Book of Thoth:> The legend of Bacchus is, first of all, that he was Diphues, double-natured,> and this appears to mean more bisexual than hermaphroditic. His madness is> also a phase of his intoxication, for he is pre-eminently the god of the vine.> He goes dancing through Asia, surrounded by various companions, all insane> with enthusiasm; they carry staffs headed with pine cones and entwined with> ivy; they also clash cymbals, and in some legends are furnished with swords,> or twined about with serpents. All the half-gods of the forest are the male> companions of the Maenad women.> > ...In the worship of Bacchus there was a representative of the god, and he was> chosen for his quality as a young and virile, but effeminate man.

Euripides’s play is notable for not only describing the worship ofBacchus in some detail, but also for its emphasis on the role of women, and itspsychological depth - common themes in his work. The ritual following is mainlyderived from excerpts from The Bacchae, edited into ceremonial form. As suchit’s not an original ritual text, though it is certainly contemporary andperfect for setting the scene that we need.[images/00048.jpg]The Bacchae contains many descriptions of how the Bacchantes, or Maenads as theywere sometimes known, worshipped. For example, at one point this exchange takesplace as the set up for a joke:PENTHEUS Is it by night or day thou performest these devotions?DIONYSUS By night mostly; darkness lends solemnity.This gives us some useful background information, as well giving the audience agood laugh - the worship of Dionysus was anything but solemn!The ritual below was originally compiled by Cathryn Orchard, to whom I amgrateful for permission to include it here. It uses text taken from bothEuripides and Crowley, to form a harmonic synthesis of ancient and modern.The BacchanalParticipants: Minimum 4, but can have a Chorus of up to 50 or moreTime required: About half an hourSetup: Moderate, though can be made more complex as required.

This needs Prudence!> - Aleister Crowley, MagickMention magick to most people and chances are they’ll think it’s all aboutstanding in a circle, and reciting strange phrases to call up demons from hell.Of course it very rarely is - unless you’re working with Goetia. Goetia ispretty much classical medieval demon evocation at its finest. It’s not the onlyexample of such – there are many medieval grimoires still extant, of varyingdegrees of usefulness; but Goetia is generally considered the pinnacle of theart and science of evocation within the Western Esoteric tradition.Many magicians wouldn’t naturally associate Goetia with group working - forexample the translation published by Crowley in 1904 doesn’t specify anythingabout requiring more than one person. In fact, several modern commentators havestated that they think that Goetia should only be performed alone. Although itcan be done by one person alone, it can also be very efficacious with more thanone; even if you have a primary Magician doing the main evocations, just havingsomeone else to act as Assistant to keep the incense burning, take notes, etc.can be extremely useful. Usually in medieval grimoires, the presence of one ormore Assistants is assumed, so for most of its long history it most certainlyhas been performed as a group operation. Goetia is also a vital part of theoriginal preparation of The Brazen Head ritual (see next chapter) which is verymuch a group working.Goetia is traditionally associated with King Solomon, the supposedly wisest manin the world according to the Judeo-Christian Bible, but it seems highlyunlikely that it was actually written by him. The earliest complete versions weknow of date from the seventeenth century, well over two thousand years afterSolomon died. Most likely it was attributed to him so people possessing a copycould say that it was a holy text, and thus save themselves from getting burntat the stake for witchcraft. The list of demons given in the book is similar tothe Steganographia of Trithemius, from around 1500 CE, and Johann Weyer’sPseudomonarchia Daemonum from 1563 CE, so it does seem to have been somethingthat was frequently worked and passed down from magician to magician for quitesome time.The Crowley publication of The Goetia was translated by S. L. Mathers (one ofthe original founders of the Golden Dawn occult order) in 1903, based on Sloanemanuscripts 2731 & 3648 in the British Library. In common with much of Mathers’other research it contained significant errors and omissions, but Crowleyappears to have found it very effective and continued to use it throughout hislife, although being Crowley it seems he simplified it greatly from its originalcomplex structure.A major innovation by Crowley was the use of the Enochian language of Dr. JohnDee. I do not intend to go deeply into Enochian in this book as it’s anexceedingly complex and involved magical system that could easily fill severalbooks on its own. It is based on the use of the “language of the angels”, asynthetic language derived from magical work done by Dee and his assistantEdward Kelly during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I of England. For more detailedinformation on Enochian I refer the reader to Lon Milo DuQuette’s excellent bookon the subject Enochian Vision Magick.Crowley translated many of the evocations of Goetia into the Enochian languagein his publication, and evidence suggests that eventually he even replaced theoriginal Conjurations entirely with the First and Second Enochian Keys. For theversion given here, I have followed this practice for the Conjurations, but keptthe rest of the working in English. The original Conjurations, although verypowerful in their own right, are based on language and events from the OldTestament of the Judeo-Christian Bible, which of course had great meaning toWestern European medieval magicians, but are unlikely to mean much to modernyoung Thelemites, who may never have even opened a Bible in their lives.Most modern books on Goetia have tended to focus on “authenticity” in gettingtheir subject matter as close as possible to the original manuscripts. Whilethis is a laudable ideal, it often doesn’t make for the most practical ofsystems. As we have seen above, Goetia has gone through many revisions since the17th century as magicians have adapted it. For this book I have kept the basicstructure of the rite very close to the original, but greatly streamlined therather wordy text.Most people have some awareness of “traditional” demonic theory - that there isa Heaven and Hell, and that the good guys go to Heaven and the bad guys go toHell. Traditionally Goetic demons are supposed to be “fallen angels” (such asBelial), who rebelled against Jehovah and were banished to Hell; or sometimesthey were older pagan Gods and Goddesses that were turned into demons when theywere conquered by the early Jewish tribes (such as Bael or Asteroth). Thesedemons resent their fallen state and will do anything to get back into Heaven -and that’s where the magician comes in. By working with a magician who is closeto God, the demons earn good karma, and get closer to redemption. As you ascendto the Divine, so do they if they are associated with you. So there is nothing“evil” about dealing with Goetia, it’s actually quite the contrary. The JewishBible reveres Solomon as holy and wise, and even the Christian Bible quotesJesus as controlling demons in the name of Beelzebub (Matthew: 24-27).Of course all of the above is based on the view of Earth being some kind ofkindergarten where God watches us and decides whether to reward us or punish usfor all eternity when we finally die. Personally I don’t hold with this beliefand I’m sure many of my readers don’t hold it either. So where does that leavedemons? If there’s no “Hell” where do they live? Honestly, I don’t know; but Isuspect they live in our unconscious minds. Crowley suspected something similar,and in the introductory section to his edition of the The Goetia added an essaynamed The Initiated Interpretation of Magick where he put forward the followingtheory:> • Our perception of reality is composed of changes in our brain chemistry> • Therefore our personal reality lies within the brain, not outside it> • Magical effects are illusory products of brain changes> • Many non-magical effects are also illusions of the brain> • Therefore magick is as real as many other everyday things that we perceive> as realityThat deals with why magick works in general. Take a moment to think about this,then move on the next set of theorums, which deal with Goetia in particular:> • Goetic magick creates magical effects> • Magical effects exist within the brain> • Therefore Goetic Spirits are portions of the human brain> • Evoking a Spirit stimulates a specific area of the brain> • General control of the brain (names of God)> • Control over brain in detail (rank of Spirit)> • Control of specific area of brain (name of Spirit)> • This area is also stimulated by sight (seal of the Spirit) & smell (incense)I think Crowley may have been on to something here, but there are some problemswith this interpretation, most notably that it assumes that magick is entirelyhappening inside one person’s head only, and has no way of affecting the outsideworld directly. However experience shows us that Goetic magical working doeshave an effect on the outside world, so there’s something missing in Crowley’stheories.Since Crowley’s time however we have had the benefit of some excellent researchdone into the nature of consciousness and change by two of my favouritescientists: Julian Jaynes and Rupert Sheldrake. Using their work as a basis, Ipresent an expanded interpretation of what might be happening (you can call itthe Jaynes-Sheldrake-Orpheus model if you like):> • Certain areas of our brains are normally inaccessible to our consciousness> (e.g. Wernicke’s Area)> • By magical stimulation of these areas we are able to “speak” to the thought> processes within them> • Through this communication we can access different modes of thought, and> increase the brain’s processing capability> • These areas can inspire new ideas and cause us to respond to our environment> in different ways> • Changes in one person’s consciousness can cause corresponding changes across> the entire speciesFor more detail on this, I recommend the reader study The Origin ofConsciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind by Julian Jaynes, and A NewScience of Life by Rupert Sheldrake. Be warned that they aren’t easy reading,especially Jaynes’ book.Note that you IN-voke (call from outside into you) a god or goddess, but E-voke(call out from within you) a demon.Practically speaking however, it’s really irrelevant whether you believe indemons with pitchforks that come from Hell, or whether you believe it’s justpart of your own unconscious mind. What is important is that these spirits areas real as anything else in the world, have their own personalities, and areentirely capable of acting independently of you; and that’s what makes them souseful. Instead of you having to worry about every little detail of stuff, youcan instruct the Spirits to handle it for you, and go on about your life,knowing that the Spirits are doing the dirty work for you.However it’s important to remember that just because demons may be part of yourown unconscious doesn’t mean that you can dispense with the required parts ofthe ritual given here - you’d be surprised how little you really know about thesubtle workings of the inside of your own head.So how do we do this evocation then?Preliminaries> What is the theory implied in such rituals as those of the Goetia?

Which one we decide to evoke will depend greatly on what we’re tryingto achieve. So before going any further you need to sit down and write downexactly what it is you need. And I do mean exactly. Demons thrive on vaguenessand ambiguity. They are lazy workers who will take any opportunity to wiggle outof having to do something. And they are incredible rules lawyers - they’llhappily argue for hours over what a certain thing says, if it means they can getaway with not doing some work. So don’t leave them any wiggle room - figure outin detail precisely what you need done, and precisely when it needs to be done.Dot every i and cross every t, down to the last word and the last minute.Demons are not your friends, and don’t ever catch yourself thinking that. Theyare more like business partners, who are happy to do whatever needs to be doneproviding it’s in the contract. But a contract is only good as long as it isbased on mutual respect. If you want these Goetic forces to obey you, yourprinciples should be noble and correct at all times. Yes, you could use Goetiato go out and mess with people you don’t like, but you’re not likely to get muchrespect from the demons you send to do the job. They might not have much of amoral sense, but they expect you to have one. So at all times, remember yourbasic Thelemic principles: every man and every woman is a star, and love is thelaw, love under will. If you go against principles such these, your Goeticmagick is likely to get seriously messed up. I strongly advise against doinganything to force other people to bend to your desires; that means thatgenerally it’s a bad idea to ask demons to make someone fall in love with you,or to kill someone, or any similar practice. It’s perfectly legitimate to useGoetia to aid you, but not at someone else’s expense. This goes double for theuse of Goetia against fellow initiates of your magical group – that’s a recipefor disaster, for you as well as them.You need to write down what it is you want to achieve, and the practical stepsnecessary to achieve it. Note that “Make me rich” isn’t really very detailed,and would be a perfect example of a very bad thing to write down. Better wouldbe something like “Help me get a job that pays well doing something that I love”would be better, but still leaves lots of room for confusion - that’s the kindof request that a demon would look at and immediately think “Ah, she wants to bea porn star, let’s make that happen!” So learn to specify what it is you reallyneed.Note that I say what you need, not what you want, since these are often twocompletely different things. You might think you want free beer for the rest ofyour life, but you may realise you were wrong a few years later when you’relaying in hospital waiting for a new liver. So try to think ahead about what itis your life really requires, and work towards that.If you’re doing Goetia as a group endeavor, it’s also important that everyone inthe group be informed of the purpose of the rite, and to be in agreement withit. You don’t want to be asking the demon to do something, only to have someonesay “Hang on, I’m not so sure about that...” So do take care that everyone is inabsolute agreement.Another important thing to remember is to put in a time limit for the demon todo the work. This should be reasonably realistic, but not so far away that itgets too vague. Also demons don’t wear watches, so try to use times they canunderstand: “one solar day” is better than “24 hours”, and “one lunar month”better than 4 weeks. For example, if you’re doing your ritual at the time of theFull Moon, then something like “by the next time the Moon is Full” is a perfectway to express the time limit. What makes a good time frame depends on thesituation, but a maximum of three months is probably as far as you want toextend anything. If the thing you want requires a longer time frame to come topass, try to break it up into chunks so you can track how it progresses.Choosing your DemonOnce you’ve figured out precisely what you want, you need to figure out whichdemon will be most effective in delivering that aim. There are 72 to choosefrom, each with various talents and abilities. Some of these medieval talentsmay seem rather quaint and outdated today - for example Leraje’s talent formaking arrow wounds putrefy may not be particularly useful to most readers ofthis book. However it’s important to remember that in many cases their talentsare still relevant when translated into modern day usage. So examine thedescriptions given of each Spirit closely to see which one seems closest to thething you need.Demonic society appears to be rather hierarchical, and each of the Spirits ofGoetia is somewhat of an aristocrat in that society - these aren’t your commonor garden demons. They have titles and often command entire demonic legions oftheir own. It’s important to check what rank is held by the demon that youchoose. Their titles and attributions are (in approximate order of rank from topto bottom):> • King: Sol (Gold)> • Prince or Prelate: Jupiter (Tin)> • Duke: Venus (Copper)> • Marquis: Luna (Silver)> • Earl: Mars (Iron)> • President: Mercury (alloy containing Silver)> • Knight: Saturn (Lead)Generally speaking the lower in rank they are the easier they should be tocommand, so you might not want to start with a King or Prince. Aim for somethinglower in the hierarchy first. However remember that even a Knight or a Presidentis not exactly working-class. These guys won’t be doing the work themselves,most of them have entire legions of servitors under their command. Conversely,even the highest demonic power is still subservient to the angels, who in turnrank below the gods. That’s a vital principle to remember - in a classicoperation of evocation you first connect with the divine powers, and then in thename of the gods you command angels who in turn command demonic princes, who inturn command the lesser servitors.For all evocations the moon should be 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, or 14 days old (i.e.waxing, not waning). From the time of the Full Moon to the time of the New Moonyou should not perform Goetic evocation. It’s never specified why, in theoriginal text, but I assume it’s because traditionally the time of the waxingMoon is a more positive time for doing magick.The time of day at which you will do your evocation depends on which rank yourdemon holds:> • King: 09.00-Noon & 15.00-Sunset> • Prince or Prelate: any time> • Duke: Sunrise-Noon in clear weather> • Marquis: 15.00-21.00 & 21.00-Sunrise> • Earl: any time, as long as the place has no people or noise (e.g. deep in> the woods)> • President: any time except Twilight & Night (unless you are also invoking> his King)> • Knight: Dawn-Sunrise & 16.00-SunsetProcedureIf you take a look at a traditional book on Goetia you’ll see a huge amount oftext that basically tends to go on and on. But let’s look beyond all the flowerylanguage and look at the basic structure of Goetia. It’s a very formal system,and it’s important that when you come to do it that you follow the structurevery clearly and precisely. Briefly it works as follows:1. Set up the temple2. Ritual bath & purification3. Preliminary Invocation (prayers according to your work)4. Conjuration(s)5. Constraint (if necessary)6. Deliver command to Spirit7. License to depart8. Prayer of thanksLet’s start with point 1, setting up the temple. Every Goetic temple needs thefollowing equipment:1. Magick circle2. Triangle of Art3. Crystal ball, magick mirror, or bowl of water4. Seal of the Spirit (& container for later)5. Robe6. Hexagram7. Pentagram8. Wand9. Ring10. Incense & burner11. Vessel of BrassThe magick circle is traditionally three metres in diameter. You can make one bypainting a circle on the floor or on a piece of carpet that you can roll uplater; or just use a long cord spread around you to make a circle you can standwithin. Inside the perimeter of the circle you need to inscribe “the Holy Namesof God”. These can be any gods or goddesses that you feel an affinity with - ifyou’ve been doing some of the other rituals in this book you may already havebuilt up a relationship with some of the deities you’ve invoked. If so, usethem, they will be your magical protectors during your evocations. You’ll bestaying inside this circle all the way through the evocation.Outside the circle lies the Triangle of Art. This is the place where the Spiritwill appear when evoked. It’s an equilateral triangle, with each side normallyabout a meter in length. It should have more divine names around the outside(though I usually don’t bother with this), and the names of your protector angelin the inner corners. The traditional Triangle of Art has the name MI-CHA-ELwritten around the inside. You may wish to substitute the name of your own HolyGuardian Angel (if known) or perhaps AIWASS, the Angel that delivered the Bookof the Law, would be fitting for a Thelemic magician. Another good option wouldbe to use the name MEI-TH-RAS instead, since the archangel Michael was basicallya Judeo-Christianre-interpretation of Mithras anyway.Within the Triangle draw another smaller circle, preferably in green, this isyour “target zone” for evocation. Needless to say, you do not stand in thisTriangle, it’s where the Spirit goes, not you. Within this circle you shouldplace a magick mirror (traditionally a concave black mirror, but any smallmirror should do), a bowl of water, or perhaps a crystal ball. This serves togive the demon something to manifest through during the evocation.Each of the Spirits of the Goetia has its own Seal. You need to draw this out on“virgin parchment” - which simply means paper that hasn’t been used before,nothing to do with real virgins, I assure you! You’ll be using this as avisualisation tool during the ritual itself, and afterwards if you need to callthe Spirit again. So you’ll need to prepare something to keep the Seal in afterthe rite, you don’t want it getting damaged accidentally. In a very real sense,it’s the representation of the Spirit in your world, so look after it.The traditional magical robe is just a plain white over-the-head garment. Linenwas originally specified in most medieval books, but you have to remember thatthey didn’t have a lot of other light material to work with in Europe back then;today we have a lot more choice in textiles. You can make one yourself, or justgo to your local Arab dress emporium and buy a very nice one for very littlemoney. If you are a member of a magical order, for example if you’re an initiateof O.T.O. you could wear the robe of your Degree. The advantage of this it thatit helps to show your authority as a magician, and demons respect that they aredealing with a “professional”.The Hexagram, composed of two interlocking triangles, is the representation ofthe union of man and divine. Again, it serves to show the authority of themagician, and your connection with the gods. It may be embroidered on to therobe, or simply drawn on paper and pinned to it. The original text says itshould be fastened to the “skirt” of the robe, which can be anywhere from thechest down really. Initiates of the III Degree of O.T.O. will not require this.The Pentagram is to be engraved on a small disk traditionally made of silver orgold. However you could also use the metal attributed to the Spirit you will beevoking, which might be iron, copper, lead etc. On one side of the disk engravea simple pentagram shape, on the other side engrave the sigil of the Spiritagain. If you can’t engrave, you could paint it - however I do recommend thepurchase of a cheap electric engraving tool, you’ll be amazed at how much funyou can have with one of these things! Attach a ribbon to the disk when you’redone, you’ll be wearing it during the evocation.The Wand is the symbol of your Will. Traditionally it should be the length ofyour forearm, measured from the tips of your fingers to the elbow. You caneasily make one of these yourself, or just go buy a length of dowel rod fromyour local hardware store. Rub some oil into it to keep it in good condition.The Ring was traditionally made of iron, possibly with brass engraving. It had apentagram engraved upon it, possibly with the name of God written around it orinside it. Again you could use whatever god name is most appropriate to yourpersonal system. If in doubt, a powerful commanding god would be most advisable,for example Ra-Hoor-Khuit. The ring is used to control recalcitrant demons -note that during the ritual you are told to stretch out your hand whencommanding the spirit, so presumably the ring would be on your hand while doingso.For any kind of evocation you’ll need incense - and I don’t mean a couple ofjoss sticks. You’ll probably need something very strong and heavy for the fullmedieval feel. Abramelin incense is ideal, or Frankincense at a pinch. Order agoodly amount from your local occult/new age supply store, and some charcoaldisks to go with it. The quality of Abramelin incense sold by many occult supplystores does vary considerably however, so you may have to shop around. Get anincense burner that’s a decent size and that’s well insulated so that it isn’tgoing to burn a hole in your table when you set it down. For the rite somepeople like to put the incense and burner in the Triangle, but if the smoke runsout during the ritual you can’t get back at it to add some more incense; so youmight prefer to keep your burner in the circle with you instead (just don’tleave it on the floor where you can step on it!).The “Vessel of Brass” is one of the more unusual items - it’s used to threatenand, if need be, punish a recalcitrant Spirit. In design it’s supposed to be asmall brass bottle with a lead cap that can be melted to seal it shut. The ideais that if the Spirit does not do what it’s supposed to do, you’ll put its Sealinside the bottle, melt the lead cap to close it permanently, and then, I guess,never touch it again; something like the “Genie in the Bottle” story of The Bookof the One Thousand and One Nights fame. Frankly I’ve always found that simplythreatening to burn the Seal and never contact the Spirit again is usually morethan enough to get things moving, but your mileage may vary.The OperationPreparation> [So, time for the Operation itself.

The mostnotorious example of this in popular culture must be Mickey Mouse’s problems asa Sorcerer’s Apprentice in the Walt Disney cartoon Fantasia. Needless to say,don’t try this at home kids. For one thing, making brooms sweep the floor bythemselves might still be a touch too difficult for your powers.A simpler form of this type of animation was the creation of a talking head inorder to advise magicians and be a focus of their power. One of the chargeslevelled against the Knights Templar was that they had created an idol calledBaphomet that they worshipped in the form of a head. In The Temple and the LodgeBaigent & Leigh state:> ...when the officers of the French king burst into the Paris Temple on 13> October 1307, there was found a silver reliquary in the shape of a head,> containing the skull of a woman. It bore a label denoting it as ‘Caput LVIIIm’> – ‘Head 58m’. This might at first seem a mere grisly coincidence. But in the> list of charges drawn up by the Inquisition against the Templars on 12 August> 1308, there appears the following:> • Item, that in each province they had idols, namely heads...> • Item, that they adored these heads...> • Item, that they said the head could save them.> • Item, that [it could] make riches...> • Item, that it made the trees flower.> • Item, that [it made] the land germinate...In the Chinon Parchment, the authentic record of the Templar trials recentlyrediscovered in the Vatican Secret Archives, it appears that the Templar KnightHugo de Pérraud claimed to have seen the head of an idol in the possession ofBrother Peter Alemandin, Preceptor of Montpellier, while on a visit there.The legendary head of John the Baptist, severed at the whim of Salome, was oftenrumoured to have been later animated (whether by its own power or by another)and used as an oracle - Grant Morrison’s graphic novel The Invisibles containsan hilarious modern take on this story. Jewish mysticism has long had itstradition of the Golem, a creature of dust animated to serve its master, anobvious reference to the creation of Adam in the biblical book of Genesis. Atthe turn of the first millennium (in the Christian calendar) the occultist PopeSylvester II was reputed to have possession of a brazen head which would givehim oracular advice.Aleister Crowley was clearly influenced by many of these myths in his writing ofThe Brazen Head. In this ritual an image is graven to provide a focus for thegroup and to be used as an oracle. The creation of such a focus object, oregregore, can be an extremely useful way for a new group to direct theirenergies, or for an already existing group to re-direct themselves. Also thehead can be used as an oracle and provide guidance in situations where themembers of the group may be unsure of theirway forward.Crowley’s rite of The Brazen Head isn’t so much a ritual itself as the structurefor a rite, but that’s a good thing in this case. In many ways the magicalenergy is in the creation and animation of the head itself, and once that’sdone, all that is needed is to create the correct ritual environment for it tospeak to the group.Crowley uses as an animating spirit in his ritual the Goetic demon Belial.You’ve already come across traditional Goetia in the preceding chapter, but thisritual is based on a peculiar passage in the text, as follows:> These be the 72 Mighty Kings and Princes which King Solomon Commanded into a> Vessel of Brass, together with their Legions. Of whom BELIAL, BILETH, ASMODAY,> and GAAP, were Chief. And it is to be noted that Solomon did this because of> their pride, for he never declared other reason why he thus bound them. And> when he had thus bound them up and sealed the Vessel, he by Divine Power did> chase them all into a deep Lake or Hole in Babylon. And they of Babylon,> wondering to see such a thing, they did then go wholly into the Lake, to break> the Vessel open, expecting to find great store of Treasure therein. But when> they had broken it open, out flew the Chief Spirits immediately, with their> Legions following them; and they were all restored to their former places> except BELIAL, who entered into a certain Image, and thence gave answers unto> those who did offer Sacrifices unto him, and did worship the Image as their> God, etc.You’ll also remember that the Goetia specifically states near the end thatSpirits can not only be evoked into the Triangle of Art, but also into a Vesselof Brass. That Vessel is usually portrayed as a type of bottle, but there’s noreason why it has to be - a Vessel to contain Spirits can be of almost any sizeor shape. We can see from the passage above that the Vessel Belial entered intowas an Image, or statue. This ritual of The Brazen Head (brazen meaning made ofbrass) is designed to mimic that event, and have a Spirit enter permanently intoan Image created by you and your magical group, there to act as an oracle andhelper.Clearly Belial is appropriate to a rite of this nature, having done this sort ofthing before. Feel free to use him as well - note that even if someone else mayhave him trapped in a Vessel before, you can still do the same thing. That mayseem a little illogical - if he’s already “trapped” somewhere else, how can hecome to serve you too? In reality when we entrap a spirit in this way it’s notlike imprisoning a material creature, it’s rather more like constraining therelationship between us, the Spirit, and the universe we inhabit.There’s no reason why you can’t use any other spirit, Goetic or otherwise - theimportant thing is to find one that is suitable for your particular group.You’ve already got a working version of the Goetia in this book, so have a lookthrough the description of the spirits in the appendix. You could also thinkabout planetary spirits, or nature spirits associated with a particulargeographical region where you reside. If your group is situated near an areawith some ancient magical history then using that genus loci (spirit of theplace) is often an excellent choice.A group I worked with had as its spiritual guardian the Goetic demon Halphas andhad embodied him within the broken blade of a dagger contributed by one of themembers (who had previously been attacked with it in a bar brawl and broken itoff while it was in his assailant’s hand, but that’s another story). The reasonthat our group picked Halphas was because we were trying to build up a new localbody in a new location and Halphas has as his speciality the building up oftowers and warriors, so it seemed fitting.Before your group starts this process of choosing an animating spirit, a usefulprerequisite is a discussion of what your group’s goals and ideals are, what youall want to achieve, and why. I think it’s important that the entire group takepart in this, even if the leader/founder has a very clear idea beforehand whattheir direction should be. And it’s vital that such a discussion stick to clearsimple principles and doesn’t get distracted by trivial details.It’s easy for such a discussion to become an argument or lead to resentment ifthere are minor disagreements – don’t let this happen! Remember that you’re allthere for a purpose that supersedes tiny trivial disagreements, and to keep thatover-riding purpose in mind. If your group is a part of a bigger organizationthen it can be very helpful to consult the founding documents, constitution etc.of your Order, since your purpose needs to be in complete harmony with thosedocuments before you even think of anything else. Take your time over thisprocess, it’s really worth making sure that the entire group is moving in thesame direction before and during the creation of your head.Crowley’s rite uses a bronze head (hence the title), cast from a wax mould intraditional style. If a member of the group is capable of doing this, or willingto expend the effort to learn, you are likely to end up with an extremelypleasing and impressive bust. However many groups aren’t going to be capable ofsuch a feat, but alternatives are possible, such as using papier mache or evenmodelling clay - with the right treatment they can be surprisingly imposing,although may need careful handling. You could also use a ready-made bust orstatuette - I’ve seen people use a standard small statue of Baphomet bought in astore as a fairly effective egregore in the past.I would recommend the creation of a head though if possible, since the processof creation itself will tend to make a stronger connection with the group,symbolizing the creation of the group as an entity itself.If one person in the group will sculpt it, then it would be perhaps useful foreach member to contribute something that can be contained within it during theprocess of creation. Each member could contribute a small piece of paper withtheir (magical) name written on it, or with one word or sentence that sums uptheir aspirations for the group, which could then be encased in the head, orceremonially burnt and the ashes mixed in with the sculpting material. Anotheroption would be for each member to contribute spit, blood, hair, or other partof their vitality to help animate the head. Or to contribute a piece of earthfrom outside their home etc. - there are many possibilities. Note that these areall only suggestions, you could just use a ready-made object with strongsymbolic value to the group and proceed from there. One group I know used asmall statue that mysteriously appeared in the street outside their temple aftera celebration, and seemed connected with their workings.Once the head has been created, polished, painted, or otherwise made ready, itneeds to be consecrated to its purpose. This purpose would normally be somethinglike being an oracle or servitor for the group. This should be done using someform of evocation such as the mechanism shown in the previous chapter on Goetia:put the head into the Triangle of Art and evoke the spirit into it, then commandthe spirit to re-appear within the head in the future when called. You couldalso easily adapt any other evocatory rite, such as that of Bartzabel whichwe’ll come to in a later section of this book.Once the head is consecrated its job is not over - in fact it is just beginning.The group may want to make a regular weekly or monthly ritual to re-consecratethe head, or to use it as an oracle, or as a repository of power that themembers of the group can draw upon - the possibilities are endless. I’d suggestusing Crowley’s rite as a foundation of all subsequent ritual meetings to dowith the egregore, and add extra features as appropriate to the subject at hand.The group could simply sit in silent communion with the head for 20 minutes, ormusic could be played. The sounds of traditional religious instruments such asbullroarers, singing bowls, and sistrums can provide a good carrier for messagesfrom the head’s indwelling consciousness.Crowley specifies that the head should have two membranes, corresponding to theear and the mouth, one for “hearing” the requests of the group, and one forreplying. This seems to imply that Crowley’s original Head was designed to befitted with a two-way radio, so that “the High Pontifex” could be outside thetemple and hear and reply to what was going on within the temple, as the voiceof the Head. This idea of giving a high priest some kind of access to speak asthe god or demon was supposedly a standard device of ancient temples. It can bevery effective within the highly charged atmosphere of a magical ritual, even ifthe Postulants know consciously what’s going on. If you play role-playing games,think of the way that a Game Master takes on the voices of major Non-PlayerCharacters in order to advance the plot, and you’ll be heading in the rightdirection.Another possibility is to have the head equipped with some kind of automaticsound making apparatus, that can “speak” with the voice of the spirit inside.Now, no-one is expecting that the head will actually form English sentences inthe air around it, but it can be amazingly effective if it is capable ofcreating sounds of some sort, no matter how odd those sounds might be. I haveheard of the creation of heads in an outdoor shrine with membranes and tubesthat were agitated by the wind and created eerie sounds that under ritualconditions really did appear to be the voices of the gods. A similar effect canbe produced indoors by placing it near an air conditioner or fan. Groups withmore geeky members might try to experiment with embedded electronic tonegenerators that can produce low level pink noise or other pseudo-random sounds(or even lights). If need be you can easily create random white noise by simplyplaying a radio or television set on a channel where there is no signalbroadcast. If you do this, keep it at a low volume level, since high levels ofwhite noise can be extremely unpleasant (and even dangerous) over time. If yournoise generator has tone controls, turn down the high frequency tones, and boostthe bass a little to make the noise more “pink”. Some people find that noisesuch as this creates a very powerful effect; whereas others find it extremelyirritating and confusing.The third possibility is the simplest one: that the Head produces no physicalsound at all, and thus the “voice” of the spirit is simply a direct telepathiccommunication with the Priestess and/or the Postulants. This is certainly theeasiest system to start with and requires no special technical preparation;definitely the way I’d recommend for most groups.The ritual specifies “a Virgin Priestess dedicated to the Service of theDAIMON”. This is reminiscent of a similar line introducing the Priestess inCrowley’s Liber XV – The Gnostic Mass. In that ritual it says that the Priestess“should be actually Virgo Intacta or specially dedicated to the service of theGreat Order”, which these days is usually taken to mean that she has beeninitiated to the Degree of a Dame Knight of the East & West within O.T.O.However in the case of this operation I think any female member of the group whowished to volunteer for the office is acceptable. Perhaps some small ritual andoath of dedication could be performed before the group when she fully acceptsthe office. Actual physical virginity need not be a fixed requirement.The Priestess may also act as a Pythoness, or voice of the Spirit. She mayinterpret what the Spirit tells her and communicate this message to thePostulants. Care must be taken that she does not allow her own prejudices to getin the way, but transmit clearly what the Spirit is saying. To this end, sheshould spend as much time as possible with the Head, learning to communicatewith the Spirit and building a relationship with it over time. She should alsonot know what questions the Postulants are asking - so I suggest that allquestions are written down secretly by the Postulants before the rite begins,and the contents not shared with anyone else in the group.The other officer is the role of the Warder of the Portal, played by a “youngboy”. This need not actually be played by a male child, but can be playedsuccessfully by an adult man in his role as the personification of innocence. Itis highly advisable that children below the Age of Majority (usually 18 yearsold) are not used in this or any other rite, it can lead to serious legalissues. Do carefully check local laws on this before inviting any child into amagical temple for any reason.The ritual text implies that the Priestess receives gifts and sacrifices onbehalf of the Head. The diagram shows that there’s a black Offertory clothbetween the place of the Postulant and the altar, but there’s nothing to say howexactly it’s to be used, except that it is be to used for Offerings. Sacrificesbeing rather messy things generally, I suppose it’s reasonable to assume thatthe Virgin Priestess has some sort of bowl or dish to receive them on, ratherthan placing them directly on to cloth. Probably it’s best if the Priestessherself should perform any sacrifice needed, not the Postulants.Offerings acceptable to such a Head would depend on its nature – standard typesof offerings might be food or drink, especially corn or wine and fruits of theearth; or perhaps appropriate flowers such as sunflowers for a Solar spirit orroses for a Venusian one. Crowley’s diagram gives as examples of offerings goldand jewels, and that may also be reasonable depending on the particular spiritin the Head (though perhaps a little expensive).Sacrifices are different to offerings, and tend to require life energy fromhigher in the food chain, particularly of blood, so a cut of meat from abutcher, or a small amount of blood from the members of the group might beappropriate. A raw egg is also an easy and effective sacrifice of this type.Note that some kind of metaphorical “sacrifice” (as in “I’m sacrificing my timeand energy here”) is not acceptable. It needs to be something material thatliterally embodies life.Many people living in the Western World have moral objections to bloodsacrifice, but it’s been a standard part of magical and religious practice sincetime immemorial. Personally I have no issue with it, and have attended ritualswhere animal sacrifice was performed. Ironically I was once lectured on howhorrible killing an animal like this was by someone who was eating a hamburgerat the time, and who failed entirely to see the irony (I’m a vegetarian).If you do intend to actually sacrifice an animal (which I do not recommendunless you have a very good idea of what you’re doing), please do treat it withrespect and make sure no suffering is involved. Also be aware that in manyplaces it may be against the law to slay an animal without an appropriatelicense. If in doubt, use the ideas above regarding butcher’s blood or eggs.The Brazen HeadParticipants: Minimum three: a Priestess, a Warder of the Portal, andPostulants. The rite works well with a medium size group.Time required: Requires considerable preparation the first time. After that, 20minutes to perform.Setup: Fairly complex.Words: Minimal.Equipment:• Artificial head or materials to construct one• Altar• Veil (optional)• Censer & incense, and candle• Vessel & water• Black cloth and (optionally) bowl or dish to receive offerings• Throne (for Priestess)• Seat (for Warder of the Portal)• White robes for Priestess and WarderSee Goetia p. 31 paragraph 2. Belial entered into an Image of Brass and gaveanswers unto them that did sacrifice unto Him, and did worship the Image astheir God.> [Crowley is referring to the passage I’ve already reproduced in the> introduction above - no need to go looking for it.]> Belial is the 68th Spirit: a King mighty and powerful, created next after> Lucifer, as they pretended; yet evidently before God, since His Nature is to> deny God.> He appeareth in the form of Two Beautiful Angels seated in a Chariot of Fire.> He speaketh with a Comely Voice, saying that he “fell” first from among the> worthier sort, that were before Michael and other heavenly Angels. Id est: He> was the leader of the “Old Nobility” who resisted the usurpation of the> upstart Jehovah.

Nor even so,> unless constrained by the Will of the Exorcist.> [Note here that Crowley is fully aware that Belial does not speak the truth> except when fully constrained. So if you’re going to use Belial as your own> animating spirit, you’d better bear in mind that many of the messages the> group receives from him may be falsehoods! And don’t fall into the trap of> then assuming that if he says one thing and is a liar, then the opposite of> what he says must be true.

In many other respects, also, He is mine ownespecial DAIMON. Let me therefore cause men to pay honour to Him, as unto aGreat King!> [Crowley here calls Belial his “especial DAIMON” or Guardian. Of course in> later life the angel Aiwass would come to supplant Belial in most of this kind> of working for Crowley, and that is perhaps one possibility for a Thelemic> group to use instead.It might be aiming a little high though!]The Considerations concerning this Procedure of Art Magick aforesaid1. Let there be a Temple wrought in Ninefold Disposition, as Luna is in theHouse of Sol, and He combineth those Natures.> [Nine is the number of the Moon, and Crowley advises a temple where everything> is based around the number nine for Belial. This strikes me as a rather> strange setup, since Belial isn’t really particularly lunar or solar that I> can see, despite Crowley’s note.> If your particular egregore spirit was more Mercurial for example, you might> want to set the temple up based on the number eight, or if Venusian, the> number seven, and so on. You could do this by having an appropriate number of> candles, for example. See Liber 777 or the appendices of Book 4 for more> details on the planetary numbers. To be honest, I think this to be a little> more complex than really necessary. Personally I’d just use enough candles to> light the temple.]2. There shall be therein a Magical Circle for the Image of Brass wherein He mayenter and abide, receiving Offerings, and giving Answers; Sacrifices, andbestowing Favours.> [Crowley’s use of English might be slightly confusing at first glance here:> what he is saying is that the Spirit resides within the Head, which in turn> sits upon an altar; the altar is placed within a large Magick Circle drawn on> the floor of the temple. This Head receives Offerings and gives Answers in> return; or receives Sacrifices and bestows Favours. So if you just want> information, make an offering. However if you want the Head to actually do> something that has a material effect, a sacrifice is called for.]3. There shall be a Magical Triangle wherein the Worshipper or Postulant maykneel, when as he would adore and consult or beseech Him.> [The triangle shown in Crowley’s original diagram has a somewhat nebulous> form, so it clearly isn’t designed to have the same purpose as a classical> magical triangle in a temple. I think it’s more intended to just denote the> place where the people may congregate, and as such I didn’t think it> necessarily would even need to be a triangle at all. Also I’m personally not a> big fan of kneeling to spirits, I’d recommend a more confident approach –> standing or sitting might be more appropriate.]4. Within the Circle shall be an Altar of open brass work, but its topa plate ofthin Iron.> [That’s a tall order for an altar - I think you can happily make do with> something simpler if need be. I’m sure the Spirit won’t mind. A simple> solution is a standard wooden altar with an iron trivet on top. A trivet is> small metal tripod with a round plate on top, used for placing pots on, and> easily obtainable from any hardware store. Note that the iron & brass> combination mentioned is the same as that of the Ring used to command the> demons in Goetia.]5. Upon this Iron shall be deeply engraven the Sigillum of Belial, with theNames, Forms, Numbers, and other Symbols thereunto appropriate.> [Obviously this sigil would be different if you’re using a different spirit.> See the illustrations of the demonic sigils in the Goetia for examples of> these. If you don’t have a metal plate to top the altar with you could paint> this on wood or card, but as mentioned earlier, iron is traditionally used for> commanding spirits.]6. Into the lines of this Graving aforesaid shall be fitted the Base of theImage of this No-God Belial.> [The term No-God that Crowley uses here is quite fascinating. I think he is> trying to make us wary of allowing the spirit in the Head to be taken as being> some kind of divinity. We must treat it with respect, but not allow it to> command us. It’s an easy trap to fall into, that of assuming that if something> gives us knowledge or success, that it must be superior to us, or able to rule> over our own internal divinity. Be vigilant that you don’t fall into such a> trap. The Spirit serves you, not the other way round.]7. This Image shall be of molten Bronze after the fashion of the Head of a Man,such as the Magus TO MEGA THERION shall by His Art devise, design, model, andexecute in Red and Yellow Wax.> [This is another easy line to get confused - Crowley isn’t saying make a Head> that looks like TO MEGA THERION! He’s just referring to himself in the third> person as the artist sculpting a head of his own design. So the line actually> means that you should make a Head that looks like a human person of whatever> type you can personally devise.> Crowley uses his own magical motto of Magus TO MEGA THERION here, since he was> originally writing this ritual for his own use.> The Red and Yellow wax is used to create a mould for casting the bronze, using> the Lost-wax method (see any good bronze casting textbook for more details on> this process). I have no idea why the wax needs to be red and yellow - maybe> that’s all that Crowley had available at the time. If you’re using a different> method of creating a Head, then just ignore these instructions.]8. Within the circle, as a Veil upon the Brass Work of the Altar, shall be acertain membrane invisibly virtuous in this kind that the High Pontifex of theDAIMON albeit distant by a league and leagues and half a league from the Imago,shall hear clearly all sounds within the Circle. And within the Imago itselfshall be contrived by the Art Magick of Reginaldus de Gouraldus an Organ ofSpeech, so that the Magus or Pontifex may be able to reply to the Postulant, orto direct that which shall be done before the Circle.> [See introductory note on the Head’s sound transmission abilities. I assume> that Reginaldus de Gouraldus is simply a Latinised version of the name of an> engineer that Crowley figured could build this thing. It appears that> Crowley’s idea was for the altar to contain a hidden microphone to transmit> sound to a Magus sitting in another room outside the temple, plus an amplifier> and speaker to transmit speech from him back into the temple.]9. Upon the Circle shall be a Censer and Offertory together with a Vessel ofPure Water.> [The Vessel and Censer are used to respectively purify and consecrate the> Postulants. They may be placed on the main altar or on two small tables in> front of it. The Offertory is the place where the offerings are to be placed> during the rite, either on the main altar before the Head, or on a special> table near the Postulants - see below.]10. The Temple shall be directed by a Virgin Priestess dedicated to the Serviceof the DAIMON. She shall in her Office receive gifts and sacrifices, purify andconsecrate the Postulant, shewing forth unto him how rightly he may attain tothat which he seeketh. To aid Her, a young boy as Warder of the Portal.> [From this point on Crowley doesn’t clarify what the actual procedure of the> rite should be. One possible method is as follows:]The Priestess and Warder of the Portal are within the temple.1. The Postulants outside the temple write down the questions they wish to askand things they wish done on pieces of paper, and fold them. They knock whenthey are ready to be admitted2. The Warder of the Portal admits the Postulants to the temple.3. As they enter, they give their Offerings to the enthroned Priestess, whoplaces them on the black Offertory cloth.4. The Warder performs the opening ceremony, and opens the Veil before the Head.5. The Priestess proceeds to purify each Postulant in turn with water from theVessel, and consecrate each in turn with the smoke of the incense in the Censer.A formula similar to that in the Gnostic Mass could be used, with the Priestessmaking three crosses over the bodies of the Postulants. The Warder should attendthe Priestess ready to pass her the implements as she requires them.6. The Priestess takes the folded papers with the questions from the Postulants.The Postulants take their seats.7. The Priestess asks the Postulants to concentrate on their questions. Shetakes the folded pieces of paper and burns them in the flame.8. She seats herself on her throne, and listens to the voice of the Spirit forthe answers to the questions posed. As the Spirit moves her, she may answer orprophesy to the Postulants, or the Spirit may communicate directly with them.9. When all is done, the Postulants offer up their thanks to the Spirit. TheWarder sprinkles water on the forehead of the Priestess, to ensure herconsciousness is fully returned to her.10. The Warder closes the temple and ushers out the Postulants.> [Opening and closing the temple may be done by any standard Pentagram ritual,> or simply by using words such as “I declare this Temple (open/closed) in the> name of Heru-Ra-Ha, for the work of magical communication with the Spirit> (name of spirit) embodied herein.”]11. And so may all go to the Establishment of the Law of Thelema, andof theKingdom of Heru-Ra-Ha!> [This was the original end note in Crowley’s typescript. It could be used to> end the ritual as part of the closing (see previous note).][images/00064.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"Chapter TenAn Evocation of BartzabelThe Spirit of MarsThe Formulae of the Magick of Light, let them be puissant in the Evocation ofthe Spirit BartzabelThe Evocation of Bartzabel was first performed on the 9th of May 1910 byAleister Crowley and several other members of the A.A. and is historically aninteresting rite in many ways. It shows Crowley very much in a transitionalphase as regards to ritual working. Whereas it is based on traditional,long-winded evocation techniques, being similar to what Crowley had learned fromThe Goetia and in the Golden Dawn, the ritual also included innovations thatwere fairly unique at the time within the Western esoteric tradition. As Crowleylater wrote in Chapter 67 of his Confessions:> In the Triangle was Frater Omnia Vincam, to serve as a material basis through> which the spirit might manifest. Here was a startling innovation in tradition.> I wrote, moreover, a ritual on entirely new principles.I retained the> Cabbalistic names and formulae, but wrote most of the invocation in poetry.> The idea was to work up the magical enthusiasm through the exhilaration> induced by music.The use of a material basis to evoke a spirit into is hardly new. From timeimmemorial magicians have been evoking spirits into talismans and fetishes, orusing blood or incense to draw spirits down to earth. Crowley went one stepfurther, and decided to use a human being. Instead of evoking a spirit into aninanimate object, or evoking it to visible appearance in a cloud of incensesmoke, Crowley decided that the best thing to do was to give the spirit a realbody (at least temporarily), and then talk to it and get answers to hisquestions from the spirit while it was inside that body.Invoking gods and goddesses into human beings isn’t unusual of course - in asense that’s what powers almost every form of magick. But generally it wasalways considered vaguely dangerous to have anything “lower” than deities insidea human form. However when you actually look at what’s going on here, there aretwo important points to note.As mentioned in previous chapters, one way of looking at ritual is that weinvoke gods from the universe outside us into ourselves, whereas we evokespirits from our unconscious minds out into the universe in material form. Assuch, they are already inside us, but hidden. So we’re not really puttingsomething into our heads that isn’t there already in some form. We may becalling up deep-rooted complexes into our consciousness, which can bepsychologically dangerous (at least in the short term), but can also be verytherapeutic. Of course we need to do this in a carefully controlled way, in afully controlled environment - which is what a ritual essentially is.Also of course, many so-called spirits or demons are actually just the gods andgoddesses of older religions that have been “transmuted” or denigrated by laterreligious belief - such as the “demon” Astaroth in the Goetia, which was clearlyoriginally based on Astarte, the fertility goddess of the Phoenicians, herselfderived from the Mesopotamian goddess Ishtar. The early Biblical writers turnedher into a female demon of lust because her unbridled female sexuality didn’treally sit well with their conception of one big angry male god punishingeveryone. The Bible tries to hide the fact that Solomon, supposedly the wisestof all men, and a great Biblical hero, actually worshipped Ashtoreth and builtsacred groves to her. Fortunately for us, the writers of the Bible did not do avery good job of hiding this information - for example in 2 Kings we read thatone of Solomon’s successors as King of Israel wasn’t too happy about whatSolomon had achieved and smashed the shrines he had built:> 13. And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right> hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had builded> for Ashtoreth... did the king defile.> > 14. And he brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and filled> their places with the bones of men.The “mount of corruption” mentioned is the Mount of Olives near Jerusalem, whereSolomon built temples to various pagan gods and goddesses. The most notable ofthese shrines was probably the Garden of Gethsemane, later made famous as theplace where the legendary Jesus of Nazareth supposedly spent his last nightbefore the crucifixion. Why Jesus spent his last night on Earth in a pagangoddess shrine is not explained, but this is the kind of background stuff theydon’t teach at Christian Sunday Schools, and you can probably figure out why...One might ask then, how come Astoreth can be both an ancient pagan goddess and amedieval Judeo-Christian demon? Which one is she really? I guess the answer tothat is both, given the particular cultural matrix that most of the readers ofthis book have been brought up within. We’ve been brought up in a society wherethe “background reality” is that unbridled lust is “sinful” and belongs to theDevil (whoever he may be); and even though we may have consciously rejected thatridiculous idea of sin, unconsciously our brains are often still hard-wired intoa Judeo-Christian mindset. Most of our basic emotions and reactions are learnedresponses that are programmed into us in the first few years of our lives, andthese programmed responses rarely, if ever, change, regardless of how much wemight wish it. Magick is actually one of the (very) few methods we can use tochange this basic brain wiring, but even then it’s not easy and requires a lotof time and work. So I suppose the difference between invoking the Goddess formof Asteroth, and evoking the “demonic” form is really a matter of how we areapproaching the interface between our interior selves and our exterior reality.That was a fairly long digression from the main plot, but I think it’s importantto show that what many would consider to be “traditional magical wisdom” canoften actually be little more than superstitious belief, passed down withoutquestion from generation to generation. It’s important that we examine thesethings closely, through the twin lenses of logic and history, so that we canunderstand what’s really going on beneath the surface.So for the reasons given above, evocation of a spirit into a person, despitebeing “untraditional”, is not really as dangerous and strange as it might atfirst appear. However it’s certainly still not something that should beattempted lightly, and it requires a great deal of trust in the ability andsincerity of the adepts performing the ritual. For this reason I do notrecommend trying this ritual as it is written unless you are absolutely surethat your group can really handle it (and in 30 years of doing magick I cancount on my fingers the number of people I’ve met that I’d trust that much). Itis quite easy to adapt this ritual so that instead of a person as a MaterialBasis you can use a talisman if you want the spirit’s power permanently embodiedin something; or use a bowl of water or a magick mirror (as in Goetia) if youjust want the spirit to appear for a short time while you talk to it, ask itquestions, or ask it to perform a task for you.The other great innovation that Aleister Crowley claimed for this rite was inthe use of poetry. It did certainly show a departure from the Golden Dawn way ofworking that Crowley had been taught – the Golden Dawn was an Order wherein theynever used one word when twenty-five would do. Medieval grimoire writers hadalways enjoyed verbosity, and the Golden Dawn followed the time-honouredprinciple that if a lot of words is good, then double the words must be twice asgood. Here we see Crowley starting to realise that it wasn’t the amount of wordsthat was important, but the amount of spiritual intensity raised by theparticipants. This realisation would come to its full fruition a couple of yearslater when he was visited by Theodor Reuss, Outer Head of O.T.O. and became afull member of that Order. From that moment on Crowley set about simplifying andclarifying ritual technique, which led to the masterpieces of succinct ritualthat are the O.T.O. initiation rituals and the Gnostic Mass.Crowley writes about this process he was going through later in Magick(referring to himself in the third person):> Various considerations impelled Him to attempt conjurations in the English> language. There already existed one example, the charm of the witches in> Macbeth; although this was perhaps not meant seriously, its effect is> indubitable.> He has found iambic tetrameters enriched with many rimes both internal and> external very useful. “The Wizard Way” (Equinox I,I) gives a good idea of the> sort of thing. So does the Evocation of Bartzabel in Equinox I,IX.In a way it’s amazing that Crowley didn’t realise this sooner, since he hadalready been a poet for many years, but he had tended to separate his poeticworks and his magical works. I think at least part of the influence here wasLeila Waddell, an Australian violinist living in Britain that Crowley had becomebesotted with around this time. Music was an innate part of her magicaltechnique, and it was slowly becoming clear to Crowley that ritual music, dance,and verse was highly effective. Unfortunately, I don’t think that the poetryCrowley composed for this rite was anywhere near his best, but when recited withthe correct intent it is definitely powerful.Another innovation that we can see in hindsight is that this is one of Crowley’searliest attempts to “Thelemicise” traditional magical workings. Although TheBook of the Law had been written in 1904, it had taken several years for Crowleyto really begin to accept its principles himself, particularly its problematicand violent Third Chapter dedicated to Ra-Hoor-Khuit. In this ritual I think wecan see Crowley unconsciously attempting to magically close the distance betweenhimself and this current of Force and Fire.When Aleister Crowley did this working, the purpose was for divination. Once thespirit had appeared, questions were asked of it. Divination by spirit in thisway can often be very useful, but it can also often be rather tricky. In thiscase the latter seems to have applied. The answers that the original adepts gotwere particularly obscure, and Crowley scholars are still puzzling over themtrying to make some sense of what was said. However some of the answers arequite enlightening from a technical ritual perspective. For example at one pointit seems that Victor Neuburg, the person acting as Material Basis in thisworking, doesn’t look very happy and Crowley (the Chief Magus) asks:> Speak. Hast thou not suffered torments from Graphiel? Speak plain.To which the spirit replies:> I don’t want to be imprisoned in this form. What dost thou want?Continuing on, the spirit says a few random things, then finally admits he haslied. After that, he is clearly reluctant to speak, and tries really hard to getout of giving any answers at all. Crowley keeps asking more and more obscurequestions about magick and the spirit doesn’t seem to want to answer them, orperhaps is unable to, being only a fairly lowly spirit of Mars. The only clearanswer that was given was right at the end of the ritual when one of the otherparticipants, Commander Marston of the British Royal Navy (called AFK in thetext) asks:> AFK. Shall nations of Earth rise up against one another?> B. When?> AFK. Soon.> B. Yes.> CM. When?> B. Within 5 years. Turkey or Germany.Given that this rite was performed in 1910, and both Turkey and Germany went towar against Britain in 1914, that’s certainly remarkably accurate. I think it’simportant to remember that Bartzabel is a Martial spirit, and clearly felt agreat deal more comfortable answering questions about war than about anythingelse. Asking him questions about advanced magical doctrine was akin to asking aplumber to pontificate about nuclear physics. Despite this, Crowley pronouncedthe ritual a great success.On the subject of divination, perhaps it would be appropriate here to quote alittle more of what Crowley had to say on the subject:> I may here remark that I have always been able to foretell the future by> various methods of divination. Some give more satisfactory results than> others, some are better suited to one class of inquiry, some to another. In> all cases, constant practice, constant checking up of one’s results, critical> study of the conditions, elimination of one’s personal bias, and so on,> increase one’s accuracy. I am always experimenting and have taught myself to> get absolutely reliable results from several methods... but there is some sort> of curse on me as there was on Cassandra. I can foretell the issue of any> given situation, and feel the utmost confidence in the correctness of my> conclusion, but though I can and do act on these indications, when they> concern my own conduct I cannot use my power to benefit myself in any of the> obvious ways.You would do well to remember this in any working of divination you may do.Many years later, one of the truly great Thelemites, Jack Parsons, made a muchmore effective use of this ritual on July 5, 1945, when he evoked Bartzabel toget his revenge on L. Ron Hubbard (yes, that L. Ron Hubbard, founder ofScientology). Some time before he invented Scientology Hubbard had been livingwith Jack Parsons in Pasadena, where Agape Lodge O.T.O. was based, althoughHubbard never actually became a member of the Order. The two men quarrelled andHubbard ended up taking a boat that partly belonged to Parsons and sailing offon it. Parsons retaliated by using a solo version of this ritual to evokeBartzabel and employ it to force Hubbard to return with the boat - andapparently succeeded admirably according to a letter he wrote to Crowley aboutthe incident:> Hubbard attempted to escape me by sailing at 5 p.m. and I performed a full> invocation to Bartzabel within the circle at 8 p.m... At the same time, so far> as I can check, his ship was struck by a sudden squall off the coast, which> ripped off his sails and forced him back to port, where I took the boat in> custody.Near the end of her life I discussed this incident with Parson’s widow, MarjorieCameron Parsons, who had lived and worked with both men. Her opinion on thewhole thing was:> Ron? Let me tell you about Ron... Ron was an asshole. But he was a smart> asshole.Parsons was a smart magician too. He realised the value of using Bartzabel forthe kind of purpose he was most fitted to i.e. anger, fighting, force, andcausing trouble. A much more fitting task for Bartzabel than sitting aroundtalking about the future. So bear that in mind during your magical workings: usethe correct tool for the task you want to accomplish!An Evocation of Bartzabel the Spirit of MarsParticipants: 3-4Time required: About an hourSetup: Fairly complexWords: A goodly amountEquipment: • Circle on floor, with pentagon and Tau within• Five candles in pentagrams• Triangle of Art• Altar in the centre, with• Square of Mars and Seal of Mars• Statue of Ra-Hoor-Khuit (optional)• Rope• Burin (sharp engraving tool)• Anointing Oil• Lamen of Mars (on ribbon or cord for hanging round neck)• Torch (a lighter or matches)• Book & Pen (or preferably a digital recording device)• Statue of Isis (outside the circle in the East - optional)• Statue of Khem (outside the circle in the West - optional)• Censer & incense (inside the circle in the South)• Cup (inside the circle in the North)• Chief Magus• Robe• Uraeus crown and nemmes(Egyptian style headress - optional)• Lamen of the Heireus (optional)• 1st Talisman of Mars• Spear• Sword• Bell• Assistant Magus (sometime referred to as 2nd Magus)• Robe• Nemmes (optional)• 3rd Talisman of Mars• Magus Adjuvant (sometimes referred to as 3rd Magus)• Robe• Nemmes (optional)• 5th Talisman of Mars• If using human Material Basis• Mask• Red robe• Lamen of MarsThe Ceremony consists of Five Parts:1.

The Supreme Ritual is theother fragment. In this rite we see Crowley fully manifesting his theory of theuse of poetry to create spiritual intoxication that had been one of the featuresof the Evocation of Bartzabel - The Supreme Ritual goes a step further, and isbasically one long poem in action.Crowley wrote about his change in attitude towards ritual in a letter to JackParsons in February 1946 (quoted in Martin Starr’s excellent biographical workThe Unknown God):> ...To follow out fully all the formulae of technical ceremonial is really too> much like hard work, though for that very reason of course it is enormously> valuable. At the same time one must consider that the whole tempo of the world> has changed since the 15th century or thereabouts... These considerations> alone made me very happy when I was initiated into a method which produced> equally good results without all this how-d’you-do.It is easy to see in the following ritual the huge leap in technique thatCrowley had made in just a short few months of being initiated into the highestDegrees of O.T.O..The ritual is also notable for its distinct lack of paraphernalia. Here Crowleystrips everything down to its absolute basics: the interaction between twopeople, who between them raise divine energy. In a sense it is based on thetried and trusted Dionysian formula of “wine, woman, and song.” This obviouslyimplies that there may also be a sexual component to the ritual, although thisis never expressed openly. I leave it to you, the reader, to make up your ownmind on that question.Although it is not specified directly in the text, I think it safe to assumethat the ritual is designed for one female officer and one male. If you wish toreplace this with a ritual featuring two members of the same gender you may haveto make appropriate adjustments.At two points in the ritual the female officer may play music. This indicatesthat the ritual was probably originally written with the violinist Leila Waddellin mind for the female role, and presumably Crowley himself in the male role. Itis true that many magicians are also fairly accomplished musicians, but notnecessarily so. If you aren’t a skilled musician, or if your chosen musicalinstrument is the tuba, it might be hard to create the desired ambiancerequired. Music is required however, being one of the three sacraments mentionedin the ritual itself. You could always use a very simple musical instrument,such as a sistrum - it’s hard to play that wrong (though some magicians I knowdo have difficulty even with that). Another viable and easy solution is tosimply use pre-recorded music, which has the added advantage of leaving yourhands free for other things.It seems likely Crowley wrote this not long after being initiated to the secretsof the IXº of O.T.O. and it contains one of his few public allusions to thatDegree.Note that there is no specific magical intention given within the text of therite - it appears to be solely for the purpose of “intoxicating the soul”.However there is no doubt that significant magical energy could be raised fromthe interplay of the forces during this opus, and so it could thus perhaps beadapted for particular material purposes.The Supreme RitualParticipants: TwoTime required: About an hourSetup: SimpleWords: MediumEquipment:• Feast• Altar• Vessel of wine• Robes (optional)• Incense (optional)• A device for playing music• A small dagger• Anointing oilLet a feast be made by the Officers of the Temple. This Temple, into which theythen retire, may be any convenient place. An altar is necessary; also a vesselof wine; otherwise as may be appointed by them: e.g. the robes, etc., as said inLiber Legis.> [Robes etc. would appear to be a reference to Chapter I, verse 61 of the Book> of the Law: “...if under the night stars in the desert thou presently burnest> mine incense before me ...ye shall wear rich jewels ...I charge you earnestly> to come before me in a single robe, and covered with a rich headdress. I love> you! I yearn to you! Pale or purple, veiled or voluptuous...” All of these> phrases might be taken as appropriate instructions for optional additions.]The officers are two in number, and seek Nuit and Hadit through Babalon and theBeast. To conceal themselves, they are disguised as Isis and Osiris.> [Nuit and Hadit are the ultimate female and male deities. Babalon and the> Beast are equally a duo of female and male divine forces, but in a less> exalted form. We can see the conception as being that the two officers invoke> Babalon and the Beast first, then through their intercession achieve a> connection to the Most High.> The reference to them being “disguised as Isis and Osiris” is misleading, I> think intentionally so. This doesn’t mean that you dress up as these Egyptian> deities. Rather it refers to the O and I used throughout the text.

I engaged a young Indian girl to> look after me and settled down to steady work at Magick. I had an introduction> to an old man named Don Jesus de Medina, a descendant of the great duke of> Armada fame, and one of the highest chiefs of Scottish rite free-masonry. My> Cabbalistic knowledge being already profound by current standards, he thought> me worthy of the highest initiation in his power to confer; special powers> were obtained in view of my limited sojourn, and I was pushed rapidly through> and admitted to the thirty-third and last degree before I left the country.> I had also a certain amount of latitude granted by Mathers to initiate> suitable people in partibus. I, therefore, established an entirely new Order> of my own, called L.I.L.: the ’Lamp of the Invisible Light’. Don Jesus became> its first High Priest. In the Order L.I.L., the letters L.P.D. are the> monograms of the mysteries. An explanation of these letters is given by Dumas> in the prologues of his Memoirs of a Physician, and Eliphas Levi discusses> them at some length. I, however, remembered them directly from my incarnation> as Cagliostro.

Much of the symbolism is derived from passages taken fromthe Judeo-Christian Bible, as was (and still is) common in Masonic initiation.It’s notable that many of the biblical passages are drawn from the Book ofRevelations. It appears Crowley was already much influenced by notions of theApocalypse. However Crowley also adds Egyptian touches similar to what he wasfamiliar with from his own Golden Dawn initiations.As Crowley mentions in the Confessions, the letters LPD play an important rolein the ceremony. These letters were originally found inscribed near to the Sealof Cagliostro (whom Crowley claimed as an earlier incarnation), pictured below.Eliphas Levi describes the Seal in his History of Magick:[images/00051.jpg]Seal of Cagliostro> “As explained by the cabalistic letters of the names Acharat and Althotas, it> expresses the chief characteristics of the Great Arcanum and the Great Work.> It is a serpent pierced by an arrow, thus representing the letter Aleph, an> image of the union between active and passive, spirit and life, will and> light. The arrow is that of the antique Apollo, while the serpent is the> python of fable, the green dragon of Hermetic philosophy. The letter Aleph> represents equilibrated unity. This pantacle is reproduced under various forms> in the talismans of old magic.... The arrow signifies the active principle,> will, magical action, the coagulation of the dissolvent, the fixation of the> volatile by projection and the penetration of earth by fire. The union of the> two is the universal balance, the Great Arcanum, the Great Work, the> equilibrium of Jachin and Boaz. The initials L.P.D., which accompany this> figure, signify Liberty, Power, Duty, and also Light, Proportion, Density;> Law, Principle and Right. The Freemasons have changed the order of these> initials, and in the form of L.·.D.·.P.: . they render them as Liberte de> Penser, Liberty of Thought, inscribing these on a symbolical bridge, but for> those who are not initiated they substitute Liberte de Passer, Liberty of> Passage. In the records of the prosecution of Cagliostro it is said that his> examination elicited another meaning as follows: Lilia destrue pedibus:> Trample the lilies under foot; and in support of this version may be cited a> Masonic medal of the sixteenth or seventeenth century, depicting a branch of> lilies severed by sword, having these words on the exergue: Talem dabit ultio> messem - Revenge shall give this harvest.Crowley was heavily influenced by Levi’s work at this time (he would later cometo believe that he was Levi’s reincarnation as well), as can be seen by theaddition of several passages from Levi’s work in this ritual; most notably theElemental Prayers. These Elemental Prayers serve as invocations to the spiritsof the elements during the ritual, inviting the salamanders (fire), undines(water), slyphs (air), and gnomes (earth) to participate in consecrating thecandidate.Unfortunately it appears that Crowley’s experiment in setting up L.I.L. neverworked out. A few years later he set up the A.A. in which the letters LPD tookon even more significance (see Crowley’s Probationer Oath form reprinted in TheLaw is for All and other places); and later still he joined O.T.O. These twoorders formed the great bulk of his work for the rest of his life. Since thenthis initiation rite has become something of an orphan without a home, and assuch, open to us to study and perform.As an initiation ritual, this piece is somewhat different from the others I’vegiven in the book. It has a very different purpose for one thing - it’s designedto initiate and consecrate a candidate into working in a group. The wordinitiation is derived from Latin roots meaning to begin something new and toparticipate in secret rites, and initiation is an almost essential prerequisiteto good magical group working. Initiation helps bind the new candidate to thegroup, and serves to transmit in a tightly focused manner the essential beliefsand principles that the group adheres to. In turn that means that an initiationritual needs to be very well designed and performed by those already in thegroup.A good initiation rite needs to contain all of the following:> • A candidate for initiation (obviously)> • Initiation officers who are confirmed members of the group already, and> aware of its principles> • A strong dramatic setting> • Some kind of ordeal that the candidate must pass through> • A secret that is passed to the candidate during the ritual> • Moral or ethical teaching that the group espouses> • Oaths of loyalty to the group and its principles> • Fulfilment or enlightenment of the candidate> Building a ritual that contains all of these things in a coherent form is noeasy task, and I don’t recommend that you try. Even before you can start youneed to figure out exactly what the principles of the group are, and of courseyou have the problem of who has the authority to perform the initiation in thefirst place.I strongly recommend that readers apply for initiation in an established,successful, long-running Order - I joined O.T.O. myself over twenty years agoand I’m very happy I did, it changed my life utterly in an extremely positiveway. If the group you are working with is already part of an established magicalOrder such as O.T.O. then there’s really no need to work this rite. However I dounderstand that some people would rather work with their own small group, so ifyou are forming your own group you could use this rite as a template for yourown initiation ritual with only small changes required. Alternately, if you areconsidering initiation into an established group then this should give you someidea of what initiation is about.The ritual as written requires just one officer plus the candidate. However Irecommend that there be two officers, the second officer leading the candidatearound the temple and acting to prompt the candidate on his answers during theinitiation. This makes the ritual a lot more fluid in practice. The candidatewill certainly require prompting at several points, so when doing this, do besure to prompt her clearly - don’t whisper, but give answers in a slow, clearvoice. During initiation candidates tend to be rather nervous and won’t pick upwhispers too well.Once you have used the ritual a few times to initiate people into your group,those initiates can of course attend new initiations as spectators, so you mightend up with several people in the temple during an initiation. If so, one ofthem could also be deputised to read the Elemental Prayers during the rite.This rite makes the candidate “an High Priest”. There is evidence to suggestthat in later life Aleister Crowley would probably not have used this titlequite so freely; in a letter to Frater Achad in 1919 in reference to the GnosticCatholic Church (Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica) Crowley says:> ...you can’t elect a priest... I am ordained priest and consecrated Bishop and> Archbishop by the laying on of hands. Nothing else is valid.Since this laying on of hands occurred some years after Crowley wrote thisritual of L.I.L., even by his own reckoning he did not have the spiritualauthority to consecrate someone as an High Priest at the time he was puttingthis ritual together. Crowley was still fairly young and inexperienced when hefirst wrote this ritual (he was in his mid-Twenties) and to be honest I don’tthink he fully understood the concept of priesthood at that time - it probablyjust sounded fairly impressive to him, so he stuck it in. The fact that theinitiation didn’t seem to have the effect he originally intended would seem tobear out the theory that his decision in this case may have been flawed.By the same logic if you do decide to use this rite for your group you mightwant to replace “High Priest” with “New Initiate” instead. It’s a much moreaccurate term in the context of the ritual, so I’d definitely advise such asubstitution.“High Priest” in the original Biblical sense of the word meant someone whoperforms sacrifices to the gods, particularly animal sacrifice, and there is areference to this custom within the rite. Although modern Christianity tries towhitewash it, early Jewish religion was heavily based on animal sacrifice - theBiblical story of Cain and Abel is all about the fact that Jehovah prefersanimal sacrifice to vegetable sacrifice. I personally have nothing morallyagainst animal sacrifice; it’s no different than eating a hamburger after all -and it could be argued that sacrificial animals are at least treatedrespectfully while they are alive. However I certainly don’t encourage readersto go out and start biting the heads off chickens after having undergone thisrite. Animal sacrifice requires a great deal of training and skill, not tomention that in many places there are laws against it. The sacrifice performedduring this ritual itself is a good example of modern Western sacrificialpractice - the new initiate sacrifices the life energy embodied within theflower, salt and other items on the altar to the Gods.I’ve excised one section near the end where the Adept talks a couple ofparagraphs of Qabalistic nonsense - it’s not useful in the context of the rite,and serves no real practical purpose. For reference the excised section is:> The secret meaning of the first is “the Blood of the Lamb”. For the Greek> Letters L P D combined give W D M in Coptic, and these again give the Hebrew> Word “Dam”, blood, which by Temurah yield Car = Lamb. L.V.X. is the mystic> expansion of the Cross or Hebrew Tau and if this letter is inserted in the> midst of Car we have KThR, Kether the Crown.> The Age of the Priesthood is 114 years, from L.P.D. and it refers to the> mourning of Isis over the Slain Osiris, that is, to the lamentation of the> priesthood over their country. For Daleth Mem Ayin means “tear”. The> Corresponding Sign of Greeting: The Priests weep or sigh heavily. The Answer> is 65 and the elder Priest is glad, saying “Adonai hath shone in His Palace”,> the other is glad also, and replies “Keep Silence”.If you really like it you can add it back in; I’d recommend that you give it onpaper to the Candidates as part of their studies after the ritual is over.The Ritual of Consecration of an High Priest of L.I.L.Participants: Minimum threeTime required: About an hourSetup: Relatively complexWords: Quite a lotEquipment:• Coffin (a simple chest or blanket box would do so long as you can put someonein it and close the lid.

A hundredyears ago this Biblical language and its context was familiar to everyone andconsidered the height of mystical expression. However to many young peoplecoming into Thelemic magick today, the Bible is little more than meaninglessdrivel. We’re living in a New Aeon where the lofty phrases mentioned in theoriginal rite no longer hold power over the people we’re trying to initiate.So in order to make the ritual a little more relevant I thought I’d try to builda new version of this ritual, somewhat in the manner which Crowley might havedone if he’d been writing it ten or twenty years later. We’ve already seen howCrowley’s attitude towards ritual changed throughout his life after hisexperience with Rose in Cairo, and again after the Evocation of Bartzabel andhis subsequent involvement with O.T.O. When Crowley originally joined O.T.O. itsinitiation rituals were extremely close to those of traditional Freemasonry;recognising that they had great power in their structure, but were full ofirrelevant Biblical references, Crowley rewrote them to harmonise fully with theprinciples and language of the Book of the Law.Crowley never bothered to update the L.I.L. ritual, since by that time L.I.L.was completely moribund; so I’ve completed the job by putting it through aprocess of “Thelemicisation” in a similar way to which Crowley altered andimproved the O.T.O. rituals. I’ve taken out all of the Judeo-Christian elements,and replaced the Biblical quotes with sections from Liber Tzaddi, one of theThelemic Holy Books that particularly deals with the process of initiation. I’vealso replaced kneeling with standing in many places, as more fitting to thesubject matter of Liber Tzaddi, and tweaked and simplified a few other smallbits as well. The result is an almost entirely new ritual based on Crowley’soriginal framework, and still using words written by him; but focused now ondealing with the direct initiation of a candidate into a working Thelemic group.If you are forming a new magical group, you could still use the original versionof this ritual as your main initiation rite, as mentioned in the last chapter;but I would recommend using this version instead.I’ve also taken out the concept that the ritual is a consecration of “an HighPriest”. As mentioned in the last chapter, after becoming a Bishop of theGnostic Catholic Church (E.G.C.) Crowley’s opinion on priesthood seems to havechanged significantly from the opinions of his youth. Crowley reorganised E.G.C.along Thelemic lines, writing the Gnostic Mass and aligning the Church moreclosely with O.T.O. practice. The consecration of an E.G.C. Bishop became partof the O.T.O. Seventh Degree ritual, and the ordination of a Priest or Priestessnow occurs within the O.T.O. Degree of Knight of the East and West.So to avert possible confusion I have modified this rite to work better as ageneral purpose initiation ritual without getting into any considerations ofpriesthood. It certainly doesn’t lose anything in the process, quite theopposite I think; concentrating it on being solely an initation ritual makes itmuch more focused on its original purpose.You may wish to change the Sign of True Esotericism to a private recognitionsign better suited to your own group’s purpose.

It simply ceased to exist after the13th century. That didn’t happen by accident, but by one of the biggestgenocidal campaigns in history.Over the past centuries many religions have been persecuted by the ChristianChurch, but the war waged against the Gnostics during the medieval periodoutweighs pretty much all the others. Not only did the Christian Church tortureand kill approximately half a million Gnostic adherents, they did everythingthey could to destroy their teachings and writings as well. For that reasonlittle of the authentic Gnostic rites has come down to us, and indeed forseveral centuries the religion was almost totally forgotten.However during the 19th century an archivist at the Library of Orleans namedJules Doinel discovered a peculiar manuscript dealing with Gnostic ideas. It hadbeen written in 1022 by Canon Stephen of Orleans, a teacher of Gnostic ideas whowas burned for heresy shortly after writing the manuscript.Doinel was a Freemason deeply interested in esotericism, and in Gnosticism hebelieved he had found the “missing link” behind the mysteries of Masonry. Thisbelief was confirmed to him in a vision during which the spirit of Jesusappeared to him and charged him with reviving the ancient Gnostic religion. Thiswas later followed by many seances in which Doinel was contacted by the spiritsof past Gnostic Bishops and given instructions in how to rebuild the GnosticChurch. He did this in 1890, and consecrated several new Bishops and “Sophias”(female Bishops), including the famous Tarot expert Gerard Encausse, who wroteunder the name of Papus. Encausse would later join the fledgling Ordo TempliOrientis in 1908, and in turn consecrate its Outer Head, Theodor Reuss, as aBishop of the Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica (Gnostic Catholic Church). Reussbecame Patriarch of E.G.C. and made it an official part of O.T.O. from thenonwards; and it still forms an important part of O.T.O today.In turn, Theodor Reuss consecrated Aleister Crowley as a Bishop of the GnosticChurch, and in 1913 Crowley composed its central public and private rite: LiberXV - The Gnostic Mass. The Gnostic Mass is rightly judged to be one of thegreatest Eucharistic rites of all time, and O.T.O. bodies all over the worldperform it regularly - I heartily recommend all readers of this book to attendone at least once in their lives, it’s a wonderful experience. However it’s nota simple rite to perform; it requires a fairly large amount of temple equipmentand five highly trained officers to be done properly. It’s so deep that no lessthan two complete books have already been written about it, as well as a hugeamount of other supplementary material being available on the Internet. I’vetaught classes on it for well over a decade, and I’m still learning more aboutit all the time.However Gnosticism is certainly one of the most important roots of modern-dayThelema, so I think it important that we have at least one Gnostic riterepresented in this book for your group to work with. Consequently for thisritual I have gone back to the source and looked at Jules Doinel’s originalrituals of the Gnostic Church. Doinel wrote three major rituals for his Church,based on his idea of original medieval Gnostic ideas: the Consolamentum, orBaptism of the Spirit; the Appareilamentum, which was a type of confession andabsolution ritual; and the Fraction du Pain, or Breaking of Bread, which was theGnostic equivalent of the Roman Catholic Eucharist.The Catholic Encyclopedia has this to say about the Gnostic Eucharist:> “It is remarkable that so little is known of the Gnostic substitute for the> Eucharist. In a number of passages we read of the breaking of the bread, but> in what this consisted is not easy to determine. The use of salt in this rite> seems to have been important (Clement, Hom. xiv), for we read distinctly how> St. Peter broke the bread of the Eucharist and ‘putting salt thereon, he gave> first to the mother and then to us.’> ...What formula of consecration was used we do not know, but the bread was> certainly signed with the Cross.”Although the Roman Catholic Church describes this as a “substitute” for theEucharist, it would appear that the Gnostics certainly considered it to be areal Eucharist. Not much else is known about the original Gnostic Eucharisthowever, which has led to some problems for those of us who would attempt torevive and expand on the Gnostic religion in the modern day.Doinel’s ceremony probably didn’t have a whole lot to do with the originalGnostic “Breaking of Bread” ritual, but it is a fascinating Eucharistic ritualin its own right, and an obvious predecessor to Crowley’s Gnostic Mass. Thisrite does not pretend to have anything like the sublimity and depth of Liber XV,but it does have the advantage of requiring fewer officers and less setup.For this Thelemic recension of the Breaking of Bread ritual I have kept theoriginal structure of Doinel’s rite fairly intact, but replaced the words withmodern Thelemic equivalents, largely derived from the Book of the Law - soalthough the words spoken have very little in common with Doinel’s text, theactual mechanism of the performance of this Mass is almost identical. The onlyoriginal words currently remaining in the ritual are the Latin ValentinianPrayer which the Congregation performs at the beginning of the ceremony and thechant they perform near the end, and which I left intact to help theCongregation feel connected to our Gnostic forebears.The original ritual was designed to be performed by any of the “Pneumatics” or“Perfecti” of Doinel’s Gnostic Church. In order to become one of these PerfectInitiates the candidate would undergo the ceremony of the Consolamentum, andthus be considered effectively baptised and confirmed within the Church. In thisversion I have entitled the lead role “Cleric”, which may be a woman or manacting in the role of Priestess or Priest. In a Thelemic context this wouldideally be someone who is an ordained Priestess or Priest of Ecclesia GnosticaCatholica, or a Novice training to be one. There is no reason why others cannotperform this role in order to understand how a basic Thelemic Eucharistic ritualworks; however it could be argued that Baptism and Confirmation into E.G.C.would assist in making a “magical link” to Doinel’s original Gnostic Church.The Doinel rite had a Deacon and Deaconess who carried the bread and wine andacted as ritual assistants. For the current version I have followed Crowley’spractice in the Gnostic Mass and replaced them with two officers referred to asthe Children. Please note the capitalisation of the word Children! Children inthis context does not mean you should use real under-18 children. The roles ofthe Children in this ritual (and in the Gnostic Mass) can be, and in my opinionshould be, played by adults. The Children within the Mass are roles based on theChildren portrayed in the Tarot card of the Sun - representations of divineinnocence and the birth of new life.One of the major advantages of this ritual as opposed to many other Eucharisticrituals, is the easiness of setup. The only temple paraphernalia required are analtar, two candles, a chafing dish, and a copy of the Book of the Law; plus apaten (plate) with Cakes of Light, and a Cup of wine (or a tray with individualgoblets of wine if you prefer). The Cakes of Light should be made as given inthe Book of the Law, but the original Gnostic custom of using simple bread andsalt would be an adequate substitute if Thelemic Cakes are not available.A chafing dish is mentioned in the original Doinel ritual, so I’ve kept it inhere as well. This is a small dish with a spirit lamp or candle burnerunderneath used for keeping food warm, such as you often see in Asianrestaurants. These can usually be easily found in cookware shops, or you coulduse an incense burner or something similar in a pinch. It is used for correctlydisposing of any leftover bits of the consecrated Cakes of Light at the end ofthe ritual, by burning them to ash. One nice touch might be to keep the ash fromone ritual to use as an ingredient when making Cakes of Light for the next one.An interesting point to note is that both the early Gnostics and the 19thcentury Gnostic revivalists did not use the word “altar”, but had a simple tableinstead, since they believed that there was no intrinsic holiness in materialthings. I have chosen to use the term altar for aesthetic reasons more thananything else - you may of course use a table if you wish. I usually just use atable and call it an altar, which works fine for me.In Book 4 Crowley speaks about the ideal conditions for the consumption of theEucharist:> “Chastity is a condition; fasting for some hours previous is a condition; an> earnest and continual aspiration is a condition.”Officers and members of the Congregation should bear these conditions in mind.Although they are by no means essential to the performance of the ritual, youmight find that they assist in the consumption of the power generated during it.Breaking of BreadParticipants: Minimum four. The rite works well with a medium to large sizegroup.Time required: Less than half an hourSetup: SimpleWords: Relatively simpleEquipment:• Altar with:• Two candles• Book of the Law• Chafing dish• Three white robes• Red, blue, or purple stole for Cleric• Two black sashes or belts for Children• Paten with Cakes of Light (or bread & salt)• Cup with wine (or tray with goblets of wine)• Missals for congregationOpeningIn the East is a small altar, upon which are two candles, and the Book of theLaw open between them.The Cleric is robed in white, with a red stole (if male) or blue stole (iffemale). Consecrated Bishops of E.G.C. may replace this with a purple stole.The Children are robed in white, with black sashes or belts. The Positive Childcarries the Paten with the Cakes of Light (or bread & salt substitute); theNegative Child carries the Cup.All three officers stand to the West of the altar, facing the Congregation; theNegative Child is to the right of the Cleric, the Positive Child to the left.The Congregation are robed in white and are seated along the North and Southsides of the temple.When they are all seated, the Cleric leads them in the Valentinian Prayer:Beati vos EonesVera vita vividi;Vos EmanationesPleromatis lucidi;Adeste visionesStolis albis candidi.> [O Ye Blessed AeonsAnimate by the True Life;O Ye EmanationsThe Pleroma fills> thee with Light;Come, Ye Sacred VisionsShining in Garments of White.]The Cleric makes a cross over the Congregation and says:Above, the gemmed azure isThe naked splendour of Nuit;She bends in ecstasy to kissThe secret ardours of Hadit.The winged globe, the starry blue,Are mine, O Ankh-af-na-khonsu!Consecration of the ElementsThe Children present the Cup and Paten to the Cleric.(Cleric strikes breast)By Bes-na-Maut my breast I beat;(Cleric makes a cross over the Cup and Paten)By wise Ta-Nech I weave my spell.(Cleric raises hands to the heavens)> Show thy star-splendour, O Nuit!(Cleric crosses arms over breast)Bid me within thine House to dwell,O winged snake of light, Hadit!Abide with me, Ra-Hoor-Khuit!The Congregation chants in response:So mote it be.The Cleric says: Then saith the prophet and slave of the beauteous one: Who amI, and what shall be the sign? So she answered him, bending down, a lambentflame of blue, all-touching, all penetrant, her lovely hands upon the blackearth, & her lithe body arched for love, and her soft feet not hurting thelittle flowers: Thou knowest! And the sign shall be my ecstasy, theconsciousness of the continuity of existence, the omnipresence of my body.(Cleric takes a Cake of Light and breaks it over the Paten)This burn: of this make cakes & eat unto me.The Cleric elevates the Cake above head height, and says:TOUTO ESTI TO SOMA MOU.(The Cleric places the Cake on the paten, kneels before it and adores)The Cleric rises, takes the Cup, elevates it, and says:TOUTO ESTI TO POTÊRION TOU HAIMATOS MOU.(The Cleric kneels again and adores; then eats a fragment of the Cake and drinksof the Cup. There is a brief pause, while music plays.)CommunionThe Cleric rises and says:Now, therefore, I am known to ye by my name Nuit, and to him by a secret namewhich I will give him when at last he knoweth me. Since I am Infinite Space, andthe Infinite Stars thereof, do ye also thus.(The Children advance and stop before each of the Congregation, offering to eachone the Cakes and the Cup.After the last of the Congregation has partaken of the bread and wine, there isan additional pause for meditation, during which the music continues to play.The Children return to their initial places before the altar.)The Cleric extends hands and says:Come forth, o children, under the stars, & take your fill of love! I am aboveyou and in you. My ecstasy is in yours. My joy is to see your joy.(The remains of the Cakes are then burned on a chafing dish.The Children place the Paten and Cup on the Altar, and cross their arms overtheir breasts.)The Congregation chant together:Hail, hail KingdomOf eternal Clarity.Hail, hail Fullnessof Divinity!Where Matter becomes MotionO deep and endless SeaMystery of Silence,Of Love, and of Beauty!The Cleric makes a cross over the Congregation and says:The unveiling of the company of heaven.Every man and every woman is a star.(The Cleric retires, escorted by the Children, who carry with them the twocandles from the altar.)[images/00098.jpg]Chapter FifteenThe Mass of BabalonIt’s become a commonplace saying in modern magical circles that writing your ownrituals is always preferable to doing stuff that’s written by other people, orthat somehow rituals written by other people won’t resonate with you as much asthose written by yourself. This is, of course, complete nonsense. It’s likesaying that building your own car is preferable to buying one made in a factory.Even professional mechanics usually buy factory-built cars, because a car is avery sophisticated piece of machinery, in which each part is highly dependent onevery other part, and requires a great deal of specialist knowledge to getright. Rituals are not dissimilar in that respect. Writing good ones takesknowledge, research, talent, and time. Lots of time - some of the ones givenhere took years to write, even for a genius like Aleister Crowley.So no, I certainly don’t subscribe to the theory that home-brewed is better. Ifin doubt, leave it to the professionals. However I’m also fully aware that thereare only fifteen rituals given in this book, and although that’s enough to keepeven a very active group busy for at least a year or two, you may eventuallywant to extend beyond them.You may have noticed in working through the book that rituals tend to followcertain set structures. If you have not noticed this, grab a notepad and pen,and go back through the book looking for common structural themes. Note thatwe’re not looking for common words here, but the stuff that lies below thewords, the framework of the rituals themselves. To continue the car metaphor, weneed to be looking at the engine and the chassis, not the paint job. We need toanalyse rituals in this way in order to understand the formula used by eachritual in order to achieve its goals.In the previous chapter on the Breaking of Bread ritual you can see the classicEucharistic ritual formula at work, which can be broken down into three stages:1. divine energy is invoked into a person (the Priestess or Priest).2. that person transmits the energy into food.3. the other people then consume the food and the divine energy contained withinit.All masses follow this formula - the long and ornate Gnostic Mass is at heartjust this process, with a lot of (very beautiful) window dressing on top. Sincethe publication of my last book, the Mass of Baphomet has become quite popularin Thelemic circles, which is very gratifying; and this can be used as a“construction kit” for quickly and easily building your own rituals.Let’s look at the ritual procedure for a standard eucharistic ceremony:1. Choose the deity you will be invoking. This can be pretty much any deity youwant. Usually it’s best to pick something you know and can relate to, butsometimes you should try to explore energies that are a little out of theordinary for you, so it’s important to be as well-rounded as you can in yourchoices. Don’t just aim for the obvious.2. Choose a sacrament appropriate to the work. The classic eucharisticsacraments are bread and wine, representing the body and blood; but you may wantto pick a food or drink that is traditionally associated with the goddess or godyou will be invoking.3. Choose roles for the ritual. In any Mass you will need at least one person toact in the priestly role to invoke the divine energy into the sacrament - youmight have more than one depending on the ritual. You will also probably needsome kind of assistant or assistants to deal with other things not directlyconnected with the main invocation - banishing, statement of intent, making surethat the other participants know what they are doing and when to do it. Otherroles may be added as required, but try to make sure they have some actualpurpose, don’t just give out titles for the sake of it.4. Prepare the temple. You will need incense appropriate to the ritual, charcoaland burner; a plate, paten, cup or other container to hold the sacrament; robes;candles; furnishings, statues, or pictures appropriate to the deity to beinvoked. And of course a place to work in - this could be someone’s living room,the local Masonic Lodge, or the nearest piece of private woodland. Just makesure you have legal permission to do the things you want to do there, and thatyou won’t get disturbed.5. Start your ritual with a statement of intent, banishing, whateverintroductory thing that will prepare the space and the people in it - usuallyperformed by whoever is in the the assistant role.6. Recite some words. You don’t need many, but you do need some in order to setthe scene, and get the ball rolling. If you are a good writer you could trywriting your own, but in my experience that’s not usually the best idea. I’vehad to sit through some truly awful occult poetry in my time, and I bet a lot ofmy readers are nodding and agreeing with that, so I’m certainly not going toencourage people to write more. Even Crowley, who was a damn good magical writermost times, wrote some ghastly and exceedingly verbose ritual poetry. So if indoubt, keep it short and simple. And steal. Steal shamelessly from everywhereyou can. As T.S. Elliot (who was a good writer) said: “Immature poets imitate;mature poets steal”. And don’t be ashamed either - huge chunks of early Wiccanrituals in the 1950s were lifted straight out of the Gnostic Mass and the Bookof the Law, and they seemed to have worked out fine. The main thing is that thewords should be very evocative and help the participants get into the correctstate of mind. So something very descriptive of the deity and the environmentthey are traditionally associated with is always useful.7. Raise the magical energy. This can be done by poetry, chanting, mantra,music, dance, sexuality, or any combination of the above - whatever you decidewill get the divine energy into the room and into the people who have taken onthe priestly role. I’ve used all of these in various combinations in the past,and they all work. Mantra is certainly the easiest if you want to get everyonefully involved.8. Get the divine energy into the Priest(ess).9. Get that energy from the Priest(ess) into the Sacrament. Physically this isusually done by the laying on of hands.10. Get the Sacrament containing the energy into the People i.e. eating anddrinking.11. Finish off. Close with thanks, feasting, hoovering, banishing, whateverseems appropriate to the work.Notice that the last few sections, which would seem to be where all the complexmagical action is, are actually the simplest. That’s because generally if you dothe preparation right, and get everyone involved in the ritual energy, theneverything else after that is usually pretty automatic; because that’s the waywe’re wired up as human beings. If you push all the right buttons, you’ll getthe right effect.The Mass of Baphomet as given in Abrahadabra uses the formula laid out above inthe following way:1. Choose the deity• In this case we have the famous goat-headed horned Templar deity known asBaphomet2. Choose a sacrament appropriate to the work.• Normally wine or Cakes of Light for Baphomet, or something else as appropriate3. Choose roles for the ritual.• In this case we have two Officers, one priest, called the Manifester, and oneassistant called the Banisher.4. Prepare the temple.• Baphomet is normally described as sitting on a blasted heath at night, so afairly simple temple setup is fine (or do it outdoors) preferably after dark.5. Start your ritual.• A simple pentagram ritual is a classic opening.6. Recite some words.• The Thelemic Holy Book Liber A’Ash deals specifically with invoking Baphometso that’s perfect.7. Raise the magical energy.• In order the keep the rite as simple and easy to learn as possible it uses amantra of just three vowels: I A O8. Get the divine energy into the Priest(ess).• Done by visualising the Manifester in the traditional image of Baphomet9. Get that energy from the Priest(ess) into the Sacrament.• Laying on of hands10. Get the Sacrament containing the energy into the People i.e. eating anddrinking.• No explanation necessary here.11. Finish off.• Repeat the Pentagram ritual used at the beginningAnd that’s it! Although this is a very simple ritual it has proven itselfextremely effective and is in regular use around the world today. I’ve seen itperformed in small bedrooms, large halls, and outdoors in the forest - itssimplicity means that it’s very flexible. Because it was built on the frameworklaid out above, we can be sure we have a well-tested example that proves thatthis formula works, and so we can easily build entirely new and very functionalrites by just adapting the same formula to invoke other divine energies.Let’s take a case study to show how this can be done. Say your group decides toinvoke the goddess Babalon, an important and popular goddess in the Thelemicpantheon. How should we go about it? Well, part 1 is already done, we havealready decided on our deity. Now we need to go to part 2 - choosing asacrament. What sacrament would be appropriate? Here’s where we need to startdoing some research on Babalon. A good place to start would be Liber Cheth, aThelemic Holy Book entirely devoted to Babalon. Let’s pick out a few usefulverses:> 1. This is the secret of the Holy Graal, that is the sacred vessel of our Lady> the Scarlet Woman, Babalon the Mother of Abominations, the bride of Chaos,> that rideth upon our Lord the Beast.> 2. Thou shalt drain out thy blood that is thy life into the golden cup of her> fornication.> ...> 11. For if thou dost not this with thy will, then shall We do this despite thy> will. So that thou attain to the Sacrament of the Graal in the Chapel of> Abominations.> ...> 14. Then shall every gain be a new sacrament, and it shall not defile thee;> thou shalt revel with the wanton in the market-place, and the virgins shall> fling roses upon thee, and the merchants bend their knees and bring thee gold> and spices. Also young boys shall pour wonderful wines for thee, and the> singers and the dancers shall sing and dance for thee.The first thing we notice right from the opening line is that the Holy Graalwhich contains the blood of the worshippers is an important part of the imagery.Also in verse 14 the sacrament is mentioned, and wonderful wines being pouredfor you. That sounds like what we’re looking for. So let’s get a cup torepresent the Graal, and red wine to represent the blood. Right away we have asacrament ready to go.Next section: roles in the ritual. We’ll need someone to incarnate the energy ofBabalon. Clearly she’s an extremely feminine goddess, so a woman would be theobvious choice, though a man could also do the job in a pinch. And Babaloncertainly has a lot of wanton sensual energy, so it should be someone who canhandle that (though you’d be surprised at how some people’s hidden inner naturecan come out in situations like these). Verse 14 also mentions virgins thatfling roses, merchants that bring gold and spices, young boys pouring wine, andsingers and dancers. Those sound like things that we could turn into otherritual roles. Perhaps we could have an assistant role of Cup Bearer, who bringsthe wine in to the ritual, and decants and serves it to the people after theGoddess has blessed it. Or we could have the part of Virgin, who brings rosesand strews them around the temple. The Role of Merchant might be an interestingone - perhaps as well as wine we could have small spicy treats as part of thesacrament? Or even have small golden trinkets that could be blessed by thegoddess and handed out as talismans to the people? That would give us fourelemental items:> • Fire: spices> • Water: wine> • Air: roses> • Earth: goldOr we can just decide to stick with wine as the sacrament, and have roses,spices, and gold on the altar during the rite, for simplicity’s sake; whichbrings us neatly to the next section, preparing the temple.Let’s look for references in the text that we could use... Verse 11 says that“thou attain to the Sacrament of the Graal in the Chapel of Abominations.” Thatsounds like a good setting. What would a Chapel of Abominations look like?Probably vaguely satanic and not too pleasant I’m guessing. So you coulddecorate in high Gothic style, maybe add some bones or surrealist paintings,candles in big candlesticks for effect of course, lots of wall hangings... youget the idea. Let’s look at some of the imagery: verse 6 mentions the City ofthe Pyramids, so perhaps a picture of pyramids might be good. Angels arementioned there too, so angelic images might be nice. Dogs and vultures arementioned in verse 10, so they are creatures associated with her – probably bestnot to bring real dogs and vultures into the temple, but statues of them couldbe interesting. Of course there’s also classic Babalon imagery in AleisterCrowley’s Tarot pack - the Lust card features Babalon riding The Beast, so thatwould make a great altar piece.With a little more research we can find other texts that may be useful. Forexample, we could always try the the Book of Revelation in the Bible:The Book of Revelations 17: 3-6> So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit> upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads> and ten horns.> And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold> and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of> abominations and filthiness of her fornication.> And upon her forehead was a name written: Mystery, Babalon The Great, The> Mother of Harlots and Abominations of the Earth.> And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood> of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her I wondered with great admiration.According to this Babalon wears purple and scarlet, and wears lots of gold andjewels, so that sounds like a good idea for what kind of attire the Priestessshould wear.Now we should have enough information to build up a fairly complete templestructure, so let’s move on to the next section: words. We already have quite abit of verbiage in the two books referenced above, but some more to choose fromis always good. So back to doing some research...Babalon is also a goddess that appears throughout the Enochian magical system.John Dee and Edward Kelley contacted her in the 16th century in the 7th EnochianAethyr, called Deo, where she communicated the following:The Daughter of Fortitude> I am the daughter of Fortitude, and ravished every hour from my youth. For> behold I am Understanding and science dwelleth in me; and the heavens oppress> me. They cover and desire me with infinite appetite; for none that are earthly> have embraced me, for I am shadowed with the Circle of the Stars and covered> with the morning clouds. My feet are swifter than the winds, and my hands are> sweeter than the morning dew. My garments are from the beginning, and my> dwelling place is in myself. The Lion knoweth not where I walk, neither do the> beast of the fields understand me. I am deflowered, yet a virgin; I sanctify> and am not sanctified. Happy is he that embraceth me: for in the night season> I am sweet, and in the day full of pleasure. My company is a harmony of many> symbols and my lips sweeter than health itself. I am a harlot for such as> ravish me, and a virgin with such as know me not. For lo, I am loved of many,> and I am a lover to many; and as many as come unto me as they should do, have> entertainment.> Purge your streets, O ye sons of men, and wash your houses clean; make> yourselves holy, and put on righteousness. Cast out your old strumpets, and> burn their clothes; abstain from the company of other women that are defiled,> that are sluttish, and not so handsome and beautiful as I, and then will I> come and dwell amongst you: and behold, I will bring forth children unto you,> and they shall be the Sons of Comfort. I will open my garments, and stand> naked before you, that your love may be more enflamed toward me.That’s certainly very resonant and rich in imagery, so could be very useful asinvocatory text. It’s spoken by Babalon herself, so might be something thePriestess could say during the rite.Aleister Crowley also explored the Enochian Aethyrs extensively, andhad thisvision concerning Babalon in the 12th Aethyr during a workingat Bou-Sada onDecember 4-5, 1909 which he published in his diary called The Vision & TheVoice. The text is spoken by the figure of the Charioteer from the Tarot card ofthe The Chariot, and begins:> Let him look upon the cup whose blood is mingled therein, for the wine of the> cup is the blood of the saints.> ...O Babylon, Babylon, thou mighty Mother, that ridest upon the crown’d beast,> let me be drunken upon the wine of thy fornications; let thy kisses wanton me> unto death, that even I, thy cup-bearer,may understand.That last line is interesting, because it refers to the speaker as beingBabalon’s cup-bearer. We already thought of perhaps having a role in the ritualof Cup Bearer so let’s have him do this whole speech at some point in theritual. That gives us two definite officer roles: a Priestess and a Cup Bearer.We could add more roles if we want, but let’s keep things simple to start with.Two sounds like enough officers for a small group.Once we have decided on that, we will need to design how the temple layout isset up. In the Mark of the Beast ritual the station of Babalon is in the West,so that might be a good place for the Priestess to be seated during the mainpart of the rite. We could then put an altar in the middle, with the Graal, andsome roses etc. and have the Cup Bearer seated in the East. Have the rest of theparticipants along the North and South sides of the temple. Add in thefurnishings we spoke of earlier and now we have the full temple ready to go.We’ll need to decide on how to build the actual format of the ritual. As anopening we could use the Mark of the Beast ritual. That’s quite fitting sinceBabalon is usually depicted riding on the Beast, so there’s a strong connectionthere. Another option would be to use Crowley’s poem to Babalon from The Book ofOaths which might work well as an opening section to a Babalon ritual:Babalon> Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.> Rue not now guilt the Devil’s dagger who draw!> I swear toward the West> On BABALON’S bold breast.> I swear toward the South> On her mad merry mouth.> I swear towards the East> On her Cup fiery-fleeced.> I swear towards the North> On Her Disk savage-swarth.> I swear toward the Height> On Her five fingers’ Spite.> I swear towards the Deep> On Her soul’s smiling sleep.> I swear towards the Centre> By Her and Him that sent Her.> I swear this Oath> Of Troth> To BABALON –> My own> Sister, and Scarlet> Harlot;> I am Her Priest> The BEAST,> To bring to birth> On earth> My word of awe,> The Law> Of Will, above> Its Love.> To BABALON> Alone> This tempered Oath> Of Troth> In Her chaste Cup> Seal up!We could even use both if we really wanted, or just stick with one to keep itsimple. Then we could follow it with the speech of the Charioteer from the 12thAethyr, as mentioned above. That should be more than enough opening work.Now we come to the crux of the whole affair - the raising of the magical energy.Liber Cheth makes much of there being singing and dancing, so that might be whatwe need here, as fitting to the wanton sensuality that we need. In a previouschapter on the Supreme Ritual we were introduced to the song given in The Vision& The Voice, 2nd Aethyr. In the vision of that Aethyr Babalon appears strongly,and Crowley describes this rather remarkable song thus:The Song of the 2nd Aethyr> So sweet is this song that no one could resist it. For in it is all the> passionate ache for the moonlight, and the great hunger of the sea, and the> terror of desolate places, - all things that lure men to the unattainable.> Omari tessala marax,> tessala dodi phornepax.> amri radara poliax> armana piliu.> amri radara piliu son’;> mari narya barbiton> madara anaphax sarpedon> andala hriliu.> [Translation:> I am the harlot that shaketh Death.> This shaking giveth the Peace of Satiate Lust.> Immortality jetteth from my skull,> And music from my vulva.> Immortality jetteth from my vulva also,> For my Whoredom is a sweet scent like a seven-stringed instrument,> Played unto God the Invisible, the all-ruler,> That goeth along giving the shrill scream of orgasm.]That sounds like a good Babalon invocation to me. And it would make a greatchant for the people - it’s only eight lines, so it could be used like a mantra.For music we could use sistrums perhaps, or some appropriate instrumentalrecorded music that might go with the chant - something sensual and rhythmicwould work well, perhaps Indian or Middle Eastern music, or if you preferWestern classical music, Ravel’s Bolero.As regards dancing, the first thing that enters my mind given the atmosphere weare building here might be belly-dancing. If your group has someone who isskilled in that practice, then by all means add it in. You could either haveseveral members of the group dance in whichever way they might feel comfortablewith, or perhaps just have the officer playing Babalon dance while everyone elseis chanting.Another option might be to have the Cup Bearer read out Liber Cheth before thechant, or even as a counterpoint to it - a very effective technique if donewell.While all that is going on, the participants need to keep focused on the truepurpose of the rite, to invoke Babalon into the body of the Priestess. You canaid this by having each member perhaps be given rose petals and in turn scatterthem at the feet of the Priestess. Or perhaps have the Priestess hold the LustTarot card in her lap or to her breast, as a focal point. Each participant needsto call on Babalon while they chant and concentrate on bringing Her energy intothe body of the Priestess.Eventually the Priestess is going to be filled with the essence of Babalon.There’s no way to describe when she will know when this point occurs, but trustme on this, she’ll know. Once that moment arrives she should raise her hands andsignal for the Cup Bearer to bring her the decanter of wine and perhaps kneelbefore her while she lays her hands on it. Once that’s done all that remains isfor the Cup Bearer to pour the wine for the people and for them to drink of Heressence.Then have the Cup Bearer close the temple with another recitation of the Babalonpoem to finish.And there we have it - one full Babalon group invocation built from scratchbefore your very eyes. And quite a complex and full-featured one at that. So nowlet’s build a proper script for it...The Mass of BabalonParticipants: Minimum three. The rite works well with a small to medium sizegroup.Time required: About half an hourSetup: MediumWords: MediumEquipment: • Altar with• Cup with wine• Rose petals (optional)• Incense & burner• Individual goblets for the people• Two seats• Priestess• Purple and scarlet attire• Jewels• Cup Bearer• DaggerIn the West is the throne of the Priestess. In the centre is the Altar. Thethrone of the Cup Bearer is to the East. The People sit along the North andSouth sides of the temple.The Cup Bearer rises, faces West, draws his dagger, and opens the temple withthe Poem to Babalon; moving around the appropriate quarters, pointing to themwith the dagger, and strewing rose petals as he recites. After swearing towardsWest, South, East, and North, he returns to face West and swears to the Height,Deep, and Centre.Cup Bearer: Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Rue not now guilt the Devil’s dagger who draw!I swear toward the WestOn BABALON’S bold breast.I swear toward the SouthOn her mad merry mouth.I swear towards the EastOn her Cup fiery-fleeced.I swear towards the NorthOn Her Disk savage-swarth.I swear toward the HeightOn Her five fingers’ Spite.I swear towards the DeepOn Her soul’s smiling sleep.I swear towards the CentreBy Her and Him that sent Her.I swear this OathOf TrothTo BABALON –My ownSister, and ScarletHarlot;I am Her PriestThe BEAST,To bring to birthOn earthMy word of awe,The LawOf Will, aboveIts Love.To BABALONAloneThis tempered OathOf TrothIn Her chaste CupSeal up!(The Cup Bearer returns to his seat and recites The Speech of the Charioteer:)Let him look upon the cup whose blood is mingled therein, for the wine of thecup is the blood of the saints. Glory unto the Scarlet Woman, Babalon the Motherof Abominations, that rideth upon the Beast, for she hath spilt their blood inevery corner of the earth and lo! she hath mingled it in the cup of herwhoredom.With the breath of her kisses hath she fermented it, and it hath become the wineof the Sacrament, the wine of the Sabbath; and in the Holy Assembly hath shepoured it out for her worshippers, and they had become drunken thereon, so thatface to face they beheld my Father. Thus are they made worthy to becomepartakers of the Mystery of this holy vessel, for the blood is the life. Sositteth she from age to age, and the righteous are never weary of her kisses,and by her murders and fornications she seduceth the world. Therein ismanifested the glory of my Father, who is truth......This is the Mystery of Babylon, the Mother of abominations, and this is themystery of her adulteries, for she hath yielded up herself to everything thatliveth, and hath become a partaker in its mystery. And because she hath madeherself the servant of each, therefore is she become the mistress of all. Not asyet canst thou comprehend her glory.Beautiful art thou, O Babylon, and desirable, for thou hast given thyself toeverything that liveth, and thy weakness hath subdued their strength. For inthat union thou didst understand. Therefore art thou called Understanding, OBabylon, Lady of the Night!This is that which is written, “O my God, in one last rapture let me attain tothe union with the many.” For she is Love, and her love is one, and she hathdivided the one love into infinite loves, and each love is one, and equal to TheOne, and therefore is she passed “from the assembly and the law and theenlightenment unto the anarchy of solitude and darkness. For ever thus must sheveil the brilliance of Her Self.” O Babylon, Babylon, thou mighty Mother, thatridest upon the crown’d beast, let me be drunken upon the wine of thyfornications; let thy kisses wanton me unto death, that even I, thy cup-bearer,may understand.(Music is played, and dancing begins. The People chant together the Song of the2nd Aethyr as a mantra.)People: Omari tessala marax,tessala dodi phornepax.amri radara poliaxarmana piliu.amri radara piliu son’;mari narya barbitonmadara anaphax sarpedonandala hriliu.(During this the Cup Bearer recites Liber Cheth, and all continue to chant andcall upon the essence of Babalon to descend into the temple, and into the bodyof the Priestesss.)Cup Bearer: 1. This is the secret of the Holy Graal, that is the sacred vesselof our Lady the Scarlet Woman, Babalon the Mother of Abominations, the bride ofChaos, that rideth upon our Lord the Beast.2. Thou shalt drain out thy blood that is thy life into the golden cup of herfornication.3. Thou shalt mingle thy life with the universal life. Thou shalt keep not backone drop.4. Then shall thy brain be dumb, and thy heart beat no more, and all thy lifeshall go from thee; and thou shalt be cast out upon the midden, and the birds ofthe air shall feast upon thy flesh, and thy bones shall whiten in the sun.5. Then shall the winds gather themselves together, and bear thee up as it werea little heap of dust in a sheet that hath four corners, and they shall give itunto the guardians of the abyss.6. And because there is no life therein, the guardians of the abyss shall bidthe angels of the winds pass by. And the angels shall lay thy dust in the Cityof the Pyramids, and the name thereof shall be no more.7. Now therefore that thou mayest achieve this ritual of the Holy Graal, do thoudivest thyself of all thy goods.8. Thou hast wealth; give it unto them that have need thereof, yet no desiretoward it.9. Thou hast health; slay thyself in the fervour of thine abandonment unto OurLady. Let thy flesh hang loose upon thy bones, and thine eyes glare with thyquenchless lust unto the Infinite, with thy passion for the Unknown, for Herthat is beyond Knowledge the accursed one.10. Thou hast love; tear thy mother from thine heart, and spit in the face ofthy father. Let thy foot trample the belly of thy wife, and let the babe at herbreast be the prey of dogs and vultures.11. For if thou dost not this with thy will, then shall We do this despite thywill. So that thou attain to the Sacrament of the Graal in the Chapel ofAbominations.12. And behold! if by stealth thou keep unto thyself one thought of thine, thenshalt thou be cast out into the abyss for ever; and thou shalt be the lonelyone, the eater of dung, the afflicted in the Day of Be-with-Us.13. Yea! verily this is the Truth, this is the Truth, this is the Truth. Untothee shall be granted joy and health and wealth and wisdom when thou art nolonger thou.14. Then shall every gain be a new sacrament, and it shall not defile thee; thoushalt revel with the wanton in the market-place, and the virgins shall flingroses upon thee, and the merchants bend their knees and bring thee gold andspices. Also young boys shall pour wonderful wines for thee, and the singers andthe dancers shall sing and dance for thee.15. Yet shalt thou not be therein, for thou shalt be forgotten, dust lost indust.16. Nor shall the aeon itself avail thee in this; for from the dust shall awhite ash be prepared by Hermes the Invisible.17. And this is the wrath of God, that these things should be thus.18. And this is the grace of God, that these things should be thus.19. Wherefore I charge you that ye come unto me in the Beginning; for if ye takebut one step in this Path, ye must arrive inevitably at the end thereof.20. This Path is beyond Life and Death; it is also beyond Love; but that ye knownot, for ye know not Love.21. And the end thereof is known not even unto Our Lady or to the Beast whereonShe rideth; nor unto the Virgin her daughter nor unto Chaos her lawful Lord; butunto the Crowned Child is it known? It is not known if it be known.1. Therefore unto Hadit and unto Nuit be the glory in the End and the Beginning;yea, in the End and the Beginning.Priestess: I am the daughter of Fortitude, and ravished every hour from myyouth. For behold I am Understanding and science dwelleth in me; and the heavensoppress me.

She indicates tothe Cup Bearer to bring forward the Wine and the Cup so that she may lay herhands on them.)Priestess: Hriliu!(All stop the chant. The Cup Bearer pours wine for the People. All drink.The Cup Bearer replaces the Cup upon the altar, and closes the temple with thePoem to Babalon as before.)Cup Bearer: Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Rue not now guilt the Devil’s dagger who draw!I swear toward the WestOn BABALON’S bold breast.I swear toward the SouthOn her mad merry mouth.I swear towards the EastOn her Cup fiery-fleeced.I swear towards the NorthOn Her Disk savage-swarth.I swear toward the HeightOn Her five fingers’ Spite.I swear towards the DeepOn Her soul’s smiling sleep.I swear towards the CentreBy Her and Him that sent Her.I swear this OathOf TrothTo BABALON –My ownSister, and ScarletHarlot;I am Her PriestThe BEAST,To bring to birthOn earthMy word of awe,The LawOf Will, aboveIts Love.To BABALONAloneThis tempered OathOf TrothIn Her chaste CupSeal up!Appendix IRituals from Liber OThe following rituals of the Pentagram and Hexagram are generally considered thefoundation of practical Western magick in the tradition of the Golden Dawnmagical Order, and as such you’ll see them repeated verbatim in hundreds ofmagical books published over the past century. Aleister Crowley received much ofhis basic magical training within the portals of the Golden Dawn, and thus whenhe set up his own spin-off version of that Order (known as A.A.) one of thefirst books of instruction he wrote was Liber O, which contained these rituals.The original inspiration for these rituals seems to have been a note by EliphasLevi in his 19th century classic work Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie(Teachings and Ritual of High Magic, usually incorrectly translated asTranscendental Magic). Levi writes:> The sign of the Cross adopted by the Christians does not exclusively belong to> them. It is also Kabbalistic and represents the oppositions and tetradic> equilibrium of the Elements. There were originally two methods of making the> Cross; one reserved for the priests and initiates, the other set apart for the> neophytes and profane. Thus, for example, the initiate, raising his hand to> his forehead said: ‘Thine is’, then brought his hand to his breast, saying:> ‘the Kingdom’, then, transferred his hand to the left shoulder saying:> ‘Justice’, and finally, to the right shoulder, saying: ‘and Mercy’. Then,> joining his hands together, added: ‘through the generating age’. TIBI SUNT> MALCHUT ET GEBURAH ET CHESED PER AEONAS - a sign of the cross which is> absolutely and splendidly Kabbalistic, and which the profanations of the> Gnosis have entirely lost to the official and militant church. The sign made> in this manner should precede and terminate the Conjuration of the Four.This translation is not a particularly good one, but you get the ideaI hope.From this little note it appears that the Golden Dawn constructed or adapted theso-called “banishing” rituals which have become the standard until today.You’ll find references to these foundation rituals in many of the group ritualsin this book, especially in the ones that Crowley wrote in his early years afterleaving the G.D. However Crowley himself grew to realise that these rituals wereseriously flawed, and several times attempted to write better versions,culminating in the Ritual of the Mark of the Beast given in Chapter 1.Bizarrely, although Crowley reworked and replaced these rituals almost entirelyafter around 1912, many Thelemites today seem to think they are still relevant -I personally don’t consider them of any value except as historical curiosities,and I haven’t used them in years. However since they are referenced in some ofthe older rites I’ve given here, I’ve thought it useful to reprint them. Idefinitely recommend more modern variations of these rites, such as Crowley’sStar Ruby or Mark of the Beast rituals; or my own Nu-Sphere Ritual or Rite ofthe Infinite Stars (published in my previous book Abrahadabra).These older rituals, like much Golden Dawn material, are frequently overlycomplex. Instead of having just one pentagram the Golden Dawn decided to havetwo for each element - one “invoking” pentagram and one “banishing” for Earth,Air, Water, and Fire. That made eight. Then they figured that adding Spirit asan element might be a good way to get a couple more. Not to be outdone theydecided not only to have those ten but to add another couple by splitting Spiritinto “Spirit Active” and “Spirit Passive” - for what reason I have absolutely noidea.It also leads to serious internal contradictions - for example the “BanishingPentagram of Air” is the same as the “Invoking Pentagram of Water”, andvice-versa. I utterly fail to see how getting rid of one element can be the sameas calling in another. On the other hand, mathematically there are only fivelines multiplied by two directions in a pentagram figure i.e. ten vectors intotal, so it’s not surprising that they ended up with such a mess once they hadmanufactured twelve pentagrams.I cannot see any practical reason for all these pentagrams, or for thedifference between invoking and banishing ones. One for each basic elementshould really be more than enough, but here we are. Luckily in most pentagramrituals only the banishing pentagram of Earth is used, so in many cases youwon’t need all of these anyway. It is true that the Mark of the Beast ritualuses the invoking pentagrams though, so you do need to know how each of theserelates to the other.As regards the Hexagram ritual given below, the Golden Dawn went into completeoverdrive with this one, and instead of just giving alternate directions indrawing the hexagrams, actually used different shapes entirely for each element.I find this to be not only unnecessary, but rather silly and pointless. I’venever understood the necessity of using Hexagram rituals at all and when I’veused “banishing” rituals I’ve always found that a simple Pentagram ritual ismore than satisfactory as a prelude and epilogue to any ritual - and even thenit’s not usually really necessary.Traditionally since the time of the G.D. Western magicians have been repeatingthe superstition that every ritual should start and end with a “banishing”, andusually they have taught that it should be the so-called Lesser Banishing Ritualof the Pentagram. Of course, such banishings were never part of traditionalmagical practice before the Golden Dawn, and Crowley himself pretty muchabandoned the practice eventually. For example in Liber XV - The Gnostic Mass,there’s no mention of a Pentagram ritual being required, nor in any of the otherrituals of this period (including the O.T.O. initiation rituals). InsteadCrowley employed a technique which might be termed “affirmation of intent”; i.e.the participants together focused on the intent of the ritual they were about toperform, affirmed their purpose in coming together, and their ability and rightto perform the work. An excellent example of this process can be seen at thebeginning of the section of the Gnostic Mass called The Ceremony of the Introit,where the Deacon leads the People in the Step & Sign, and then in the recitationof the Gnostic Creed. This method of beginning a ritual is very common acrossmany religious traditions throughout history.Crowley in later life also dispensed with the banishing at the end of a ritualentirely in many cases, especially in invocatory rituals that had as theirpurpose the establishment of Thelemic power. The Gnostic Mass is again a perfectexample of this, as are many of the rituals in this book. It makes sense really- why spend all that time bringing divine energy down to Earth, only toimmediately send it all away again?As time goes on I’ve learned to appreciate this technique more and more, andfrequently employ it instead of the traditional “Pentagram sandwich” technique,especially in many of the invocations in this book. But at the end of the day,you need to use the methods that work for you, so here are the basic Golden DawnPentagram and Hexagram rituals just in case you need them.Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram(i) Touching the forehead, say Ateh (Unto Thee).(ii) Touching the breast, say Malkuth (The Kingdom).(iii) Touching the right shoulder, say ve-Geburah (and the Power).(iv) Touching the left shoulder, say ve-Gedulah (and the Glory).(v) Clasping the hands upon the breast, say le-Olahm, Amen (To the Ages, Amen).(vi) Turning to the East, make a pentagram (that of Earth)with the proper weapon (usually the Wand). Say (i.e. vibrate) I H V H.(vii) Turning to the South, the same, but say A D N I.(viii) Turning to the West, the same, but say A H I H.(ix) Turning to the North, the same, but say A G L A.(Pronounce: Yeh-ho-vah, Ad-oh-nye, Eh-hee-eh, Ahg-lah).(x) Extending the arms in the form of a Cross, say:(xi) Before me Raphael;(xii) Behind me Gabriel;(xiii) On my right hand Michael;(xiv) On my left hand Auriel;(xv) For about me flames the Pentagram,(xvi) And in the Column stands the six-rayed Star.(xvii-xxi) Repeat (i) to (v), the “Qabalistic Cross.”[images/00038.jpg]The Banishing Pentagram of EarthLesser Banishing Ritual of the HexagramThis ritual is to be performed after the “Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram”.(i) Stand upright, feet together, left arm at side, right across body, holdingthe wand or other weapon upright in the median line. Then face East and say:(ii) I.N.R.I.Yod. Nun. Resh. Yod.Virgo, Isis, Mighty Mother.Scorpio, Apophis, Destroyer.Sol, Osiris, Slain and Risen.Isis, Apophis, Osiris, IAO.(iii) Extend the arms in the form of a cross, and say: “The Sign of OsirisSlain.”(iv) Raise the right arm to point upwards, keeping the elbow square, and lowerthe left arm to point downwards, keeping the elbow square, while turning thehead over the left shoulder looking down so that the eyes follow the leftforearm, and say, “The Sign of the Mourning of Isis.”(v) Raise the arms at an angle of sixty degrees to each other above the head,which is thrown back, and say, “The Sign of Apophis and Typhon.”(vi) Cross the arms on the breast, and bow the head and say, “The Sign of OsirisRisen.”(vii) Extend the arms again as in (iii) and cross them again as in (vi) saying:“L.V.X., Lux, the Light of the Cross”.(viii) With the magical weapon trace the Hexagram of Fire in the East, saying,“ARARITA”.This Word consists of the initials of a sentence which means “One is HisBeginning: One is His Individuality: His Permutation is One.” This hexagramconsists of two equilateral triangles, both apices pointed upwards. Begin at thetop of the upper triangle and trace it in a dextro-rotary direction. The top ofthe lower triangle should coincide with the central point of theupper triangle.(ix) Trace the Hexagram of Earth in the South, saying “ARARITA”.This Hexagram has the apex of the lower triangle pointing downwards, and itshould be capable of inscription in a circle.(x) Trace the Hexagram of Air in the West, saying “ARARITA”.This Hexagram is like that of Earth; but the bases of the triangles coincide,forming a diamond.(xi) Trace the hexagram of Water in the North, saying “ARARITA”.This hexagram has the lower triangle placed above the upper, so that theirapices coincide.(xii) Repeat (i-vii)[images/00024.jpg]Appendix IIThe 72 Spirits of the GoetiaI have updated the standard medieval descriptions of the spirits of the Goetiainto modern language, and have categorised their various qualities to make iteasier for ritualists to find and understand which one might be best for theirpurposes.

Crowley claimed that these emanated from beyond his normalconsciousness and thus contained many secrets of mystic illumination. I haveused these three particular texts as source material for the rubric of some ofthe rituals in this book, so it is only fitting if I print them in theirentirety here for you to study.Liber Stellae RubeaeA secret ritual of Apep, the Heart of IAO-OAI, delivered unto V.V.V.V.V. for hisuse in a certain matter of Liber Legis, and written down under the figure LXVI1. Apep deifieth Asar.2. Let excellent virgins evoke rejoicing, son of Night!3. This is the book of the most secret cult of the Ruby Star. It shall be givento none, save to the shameless in deed as in word.4. No man shall understand this writing - it is too subtle for the sons of men.5. If the Ruby Star have shed its blood upon thee; if in the season of the moonthou hast invoked by the Iod and the Pe, then mayest thou partake of this mostsecret sacrament.6. One shall instruct another, with no care for the matters of men’s thought.7. There shall be a fair altar in the midst, extended upon a black stone.8. At the head of the altar gold, and twin images in green of the Master.9. In the midst a cup of green wine.10. At the foot the Star of Ruby.11. The altar shall be entirely bare.12. First, the ritual of the Flaming Star.13. Next, the ritual of the Seal.14. Next, the infernal adorations of OAI15. Mu pa telai,Tu wa melaia, a, a.Tu fu tulu!Tu fu tuluPa, Sa, Ga.16. Qwi Mu telaiYa Pu melai;u, u, u.‘Se gu malai;Pe fu telai,Fu tu lu.17. O chi balaeWa pa malae: -Ut! Ut! Ut!Ge; fu latrai,Le fu malaiKut! Hut! Nut!18. Al OAIRel moaiTi - Ti - Ti!Wa la pelaiTu fu lataiWi, Ni, Bi.19. Also thou shalt excite the wheels with the five wounds and the five wounds.20. Then thou shalt excite the wheels with the two and the third in the midst;even Saturn and Jupiter, Sun and Moon, Mars and Venus, and Mercury.21. Then the five - and the sixth.22. Also the altar shall fume before the master with incense that hath no smoke.23. That which is to be denied shall be denied; that which is to be trampledshall be trampled; that which is to be spat upon shall be spat upon.24. These things shall be burnt in the outer fire.25. Then again the master shall speak as he will soft words, and with music andwhat else he will bring forward the Victim.26. Also he shall slay a young child upon the altar, and the blood shall coverthe altar with perfume as of roses.27. Then shall the master appear as He should appear - in His glory.28. He shall stretch himself upon the altar, and awake it into life, and intodeath.29. (For so we conceal that life which is beyond.)30. The temple shall be darkened, save for the fire and the lamp of the altar.31. There shall he kindle a great fire and a devouring.32. Also he shall smite the altar with his scourge, and blood shall flowtherefrom.33. Also he shall have made roses bloom thereon.34. In the end he shall offer up the Vast Sacrifice, at the moment when the Godlicks up the flame upon the altar.35. All these things shalt thou perform strictly, observing the time.36. And the Beloved shall abide with Thee.37. Thou shalt not disclose the interior world of this rite unto any one:therefore have I written it in symbols that cannot be understood.38. I who reveal the ritual am IAO and OAI; the Right and the Averse.39. These are alike unto me.40. Now the Veil of this operation is called Shame, and the Glory abidethwithin.41. Thou shalt comfort the heart of the secret stone with the warm blood. Thoushalt make a subtle decoction of delight, and the Watchers shall drink thereof.42. I, Apep the Serpent, am the heart of IAO. Isis shall await Asar, and I inthe midst.43. Also the Priestess shall seek another altar, and perform my ceremoniesthereon.44. There shall be no hymn nor dithyramb in my praise and the praise of therite, seeing that it is utterly beyond.45. Thou shalt assure thyself of the stability of the altar.46. In this rite thou shalt be alone.47. I will give thee another ceremony whereby many shall rejoice.48. Before all let the Oath be taken firmly as thou raisest up the altar fromthe black earth.49. In the words that Thou knowest.50. For I also swear unto thee by my body and soul that shall never be parted insunder that I dwell within thee coiled and ready to spring.51. I will give thee the kingdoms of the earth, O thou Who hast mastered thekingdoms of the East and of the West.52. I am Apep, O thou slain One. Thou shalt slay thyself upon mine altar: I willhave thy blood to drink.53. For I am a mighty vampire, and my children shall suck up the wine of theearth which is blood.54. Thou shalt replenish thy veins from the chalice of heaven.55. Thou shalt be secret, a fear to the world.56. Thou shalt be exalted, and none shall see thee; exalted, and none shallsuspect thee.57. For there are two glories diverse, and thou who hast won the first shaltenjoy the second.58. I leap with joy within thee; my head is arisen to strike.59. O the lust, the sheer rapture, of the life of the snake in the spine!60. Mightier than God or man, I am in them, and pervade them.61. Follow out these my words.62. Fear nothing.Fear nothing.Fear nothing.63. For I am nothing, and me thou shalt fear, O my virgin, my prophet withinwhose bowels I rejoice.64. Thou shalt fear with the fear of love: I will overcome thee.65. Thou shalt be very nigh to death.66. But I will overcome thee; the New Life shall illumine thee with the Lightthat is beyond the Stars.67. Thinkest thou? I, the force that have created all, am not to be despised.68. And I will slay thee in my lust.69. Thou shalt scream with the joy and the pain and the fear and the love - sothat the LOGOS of a new God leaps out among the Stars.70. There shall be no sound heard but this thy lion-roar of rapture; yea, thisthy lion-roar of rapture.Liber TzaddivelHamus HermeticusSub FiguraXC0. In the name of the Lord of Initiation, Amen.1. I fly and I alight as an hawk: of mother-of-emerald are my mighty-sweepingwings.2. I swoop down upon the black earth; and it gladdens into green at my coming.3. Children of Earth! rejoice! rejoice exceedingly; for your salvation is athand.4. The end of sorrow is come; I will ravish you away into mine unutterable joy.5. I will kiss you, and bring you to the bridal: I will spread a feast beforeyou in the house of happiness.6. I am not come to rebuke you, or to enslave you.7. I bid you not turn from your voluptuous ways, from your idleness, from yourfollies.8. But I bring you joy to your pleasure, peace to your languor, wisdom to yourfolly.9. All that ye do is right, if so be that ye enjoy it.10. I am come against sorrow, against weariness, against them that seek toenslave you.11. I pour you lustral wine, that giveth you delight both at the sunset and thedawn.12. Come with me, and I will give you all that is desirable upon the earth.13. Because I give you that of which Earth and its joys are but as shadows.14. They flee away, but my joy abideth even unto the end.15. I have hidden myself beneath a mask: I am a black and terrible God.16. With courage conquering fear shall ye approach me: ye shall lay down yourheads upon mine altar, expecting the sweep of the sword.17. But the first kiss of love shall be radiant on your lips; and all mydarkness and terror shall turn to light and joy.18. Only those who fear shall fail. Those who have bent their backs to the yokeof slavery until they can no longer stand upright; them will I despise.19. But you who have defied the law; you who have conquered by subtlety orforce; you will I take unto me, even I will take you unto me.20. I ask you to sacrifice nothing at mine altar; I am the God who giveth all.21. Light, Life, Love; Force, Fantasy, Fire; these do I bring you: mine handsare full of these.22. There is joy in the setting-out; there is joy in the journey; there is joyin the goal.23. Only if ye are sorrowful, or weary, or angry, or discomforted; then ye mayknow that ye have lost the golden thread, the thread wherewith I guide you tothe heart of the groves of Eleusis.24. My disciples are proud and beautiful; they are strong and swift; they ruletheir way like mighty conquerors.25. The weak, the timid, the imperfect, the cowardly, the poor, the tearful -these are mine enemies, and I am come to destroy them.26. This also is compassion: an end to the sickness of earth. A rooting-out ofthe weeds: a watering of the flowers.27. O my children, ye are more beautiful than the flowers: ye must not fade inyour season.28. I love you; I would sprinkle you with the divine dew of immortality.29. This immortality is no vain hope beyond the grave: I offer you the certainconsciousness of bliss.30. I offer it at once, on earth; before an hour hath struck upon the bell, yeshall be with Me in the Abodes that are beyond Decay.31. Also I give you power earthly and joy earthly; wealth, and health, andlength of days. Adoration and love shall cling to your feet, and twine aroundyour heart.32. Only your mouths shall drink of a delicious wine - the wine of Iacchus; theyshall reach ever to the heavenly kiss of the Beautiful God.33. I reveal unto you a great mystery. Ye stand between the abyss of height andthe abyss of depth.34. In either awaits you a Companion; and that Companion is Yourself.35. Ye can have no other Companion.36. Many have arisen, being wise. They have said “Seek out the glittering Imagein the place ever golden, and unite yourselves with It.”37. Many have arisen, being foolish. They have said, “Stoop down unto the darklysplendid world, and be wedded to that Blind Creature of the Slime.”38. I who am beyond Wisdom and Folly, arise and say unto you: achieve bothweddings! Unite yourselves with both!39. Beware, beware, I say, lest ye seek after the one and lose the other!40. My adepts stand upright; their head above the heavens, their feet below thehells.41. But since one is naturally attracted to the Angel, another to the Demon, letthe first strengthen the lower link, the last attach more firmly to the higher.42. Thus shall equilibrium become perfect. I will aid my disciples; as fast asthey acquire this balanced power and joy so faster will I push them.43. They shall in their turn speak from this Invisible Throne; their words shallillumine the worlds.44. They shall be masters of majesty and might; they shall be beautiful andjoyous; they shall be clothed with victory and splendour; they shall stand uponthe firm foundation; the kingdom shall be theirs; yea, the kingdom shall betheirs.In the name of the Lord of Initiation. Amen.Liber ChethvelVallum AbiegniSub FiguraCLVI1. This is the secret of the Holy Graal, that is the sacred vessel of our Ladythe Scarlet Woman, Babalon the Mother of Abominations, the bride of Chaos, thatrideth upon our Lord the Beast.2. Thou shalt drain out thy blood that is thy life into the golden cup of herfornication.3. Thou shalt mingle thy life with the universal life. Thou shalt keep not backone drop.4. Then shall thy brain be dumb, and thy heart beat no more, and all thy lifeshall go from thee; and thou shalt be cast out upon the midden, and the birds ofthe air shall feast upon thy flesh, and thy bones shall whiten in the sun.5. Then shall the winds gather themselves together, and bear thee up as it werea little heap of dust in a sheet that hath four corners, and they shall give itunto the guardians of the abyss.6. And because there is no life therein, the guardians of the abyss shall bidthe angels of the winds pass by. And the angels shall lay thy dust in the Cityof the Pyramids, and the name thereof shall be no more.7. Now therefore that thou mayest achieve this ritual of the Holy Graal, do thoudivest thyself of all thy goods.8. Thou hast wealth; give it unto them that have need thereof, yet no desiretoward it.9. Thou hast health; slay thyself in the fervour of thine abandonment unto OurLady. Let thy flesh hang loose upon thy bones, and thine eyes glare with thyquenchless lust unto the Infinite, with thy passion for the Unknown, for Herthat is beyond Knowledge the accursed one.10. Thou hast love; tear thy mother from thine heart, and spit in the face ofthy father. Let thy foot trample the belly of thy wife, and let the babe at herbreast be the prey of dogs and vultures.11. For if thou dost not this with thy will, then shall We do this despite thywill. So that thou attain to the Sacrament of the Graal in the Chapel ofAbominations.12. And behold! if by stealth thou keep unto thyself one thought of thine, thenshalt thou be cast out into the abyss for ever; and thou shalt be the lonelyone, the eater of dung, the afflicted in the Day of Be-with-Us.13. Yea! verily this is the Truth, this is the Truth, this is the Truth. Untothee shall be granted joy and health and wealth and wisdom when thou art nolonger thou.14. Then shall every gain be a new sacrament, and it shall not defile thee; thoushalt revel with the wanton in the market-place, and the virgins shall flingroses upon thee, and the merchants bend their knees and bring thee gold andspices. Also young boys shall pour wonderful wines for thee, and the singers andthe dancers shall sing and dance for thee.15. Yet shalt thou not be therein, for thou shalt be forgotten, dust lost indust.16. Nor shall the aeon itself avail thee in this; for from the dust shalla whiteash be prepared by Hermes the Invisible.17. And this is the wrath of God, that these things should be thus.18. And this is the grace of God, that these things should be thus.19. Wherefore I charge you that ye come unto me in the Beginning; for if ye takebut one step in this Path, ye must arrive inevitably at the end thereof.20. This Path is beyond Life and Death; it is also beyond Love; but that ye knownot, for ye know not Love.21. And the end thereof is known not even unto Our Lady or to the Beast whereonShe rideth; nor unto the Virgin her daughter nor unto Chaos her lawful Lord; butunto the Crowned Child is it known? It is not known if it be known.22. Therefore unto Hadit and unto Nuit be the glory in the End and theBeginning; yea, in the End and the Beginning.Appendix IVRitual JOath of Obligation ofa Neophyte of the Golden DawnI (name of aspirant), in the presence of the Lord of the Universe and of thisHall of Neophytes of the Order of The Golden Dawn in the Outer, regularlyassembled under warrant from the Greatly Honored Chiefs of the Second Order, doof my own free will and accord hereby and hereon most solemnly pledge myself tokeep secret this Order, its name, the name of its members, and the proceedingswhich take place at its meetings, from all and every person in the whole worldwho is outside the pale of the Order, and not even to discuss these withinitiates, unless he or they are in possession of the password for the timebeing.

Le Prélat, revêtu de l’étole(quand sa grâce le Patriarche officie, il est couvert du très auguste Pallium),élève les mains sur les espèces en disant:Eon Jesus prisquam pateretur mystice,accepit panem et vinum in stanciaset venerabiles manus suas, et,elevatis oculis in coelum, fregit (l’évêque rompt le pain),benedixit (l’évêque forme le Tau sur le pain et la coupe)et dedit discipulis uais, dicens (tout le monde se prosterne)Accipite et manducate et bibit omnes!Le diacre portant le plateau et la diaconesse portant la coupe précèdent SaSeigneurie qui s’avance vers les Parfaits. L’orgue joue une marche religieuse etlente.L’évêque, prenant le pain, l’élève au-dessus de l’assemblée en disant:Touto estin to soma pneumatikon tou Christou.Puis il repose le pain sur le plateau, s’agenouille et adore.Il se relève, prend la coupe et l’élève en disant:Calix meus inebrians quàm proeclaus est!Calicem Salutaris accipiam et nomen Domini invocabo.Il s’agenouille et adore.Il se relève, rompt un fragment du corps spirituel de Jésus et le mange. Il boità la coupe du sang.Pause. Orgues.Il s’avance ensuite vers chaque Parfait et tend le pain et la coupe à chacun.Silence. Orgues. Adoration.De retour à l’autel, l’évêque étendant les mains dit:Que la grâce du très saint Plérôme soit toujours avec vous!Les restes des espèces consacrées sont brûlés sur un réchaud, car le corpspneumatique du Seigneur ne doit pas être profané.Après quoi, Sa Seigneurie donne la bénédiction gnostique et se retire entre lesdeux assistants qui portent les flambeaux.The Ritual of the Breaking of the BreadTranslated by Rodney OrpheusThe Perfect having come together, the women with their heads covered with awhite veil and the men girded with a white cord, they kneel to receive theblessing of his Eminence, the Bishop. They rise and the choir sings thecanticle:Beati, vos ÆonesVera vita vividi;Vos EmanationesPleromatis lucidi;Adeste visionesStolis albis candidi.The Gospel of John rests between two candles on a table draped in linen. TheBishop and the Deacon and Deaconess stand before the table. Once the canticle iscompleted, his Eminence recites the Lord’s Prayer in Greek.Pater hêmôn ho en tois ouranois:Hagiasthêtô to onoma sou;Elthetô hê basileia sou;Genêthêtô to thelêma sou,Hôs en ouranôi kai epi gês;Ton arton hêmôn ton epiousion dos hêmin sêmeron;Kai aphes hêmin ta opheilêmata hêmôn,Hôs kai hêmeis aphêkamen tois opheiletais hêmôn;Kai mê eisenenkêis hêmas eis peirasmon,Alla hrusai hêmas apo tou ponêrou.Hoti sou estin hê basileia,Kai hê dynamis, kai hê doxa,Eis tous aiônas. Amên.The assembly answers:Amen.The Deacon presents the chalice and the bread to the Bishop. The Prelate puts onthe Stole (when his Grace the Patriarch officiates, he is covered with the veryaugust Pallium), raises the hands over those present and says:Eon Jesus prisquam pateretur mystice, accepit panem et vinumin stancias etvenerabiles manus suas, et, elevatis oculis in coelum, fregit(The Bishop breaks the bread)benedixit(The Bishop makes the shape of the Tau over the bread and the chalice)et dedit discipulis uais, dicens:(All prostrate themselves)Accipite et manducate et bibit omnes!The Deacon carrying the plate and the Deaconess carrying the chalice precede hisEminence who advances towards the Perfect. The organ plays a slow religiousmarch.The Bishop, taking the bread, raises it above the assembly while saying:Touto estin to soma pneumatikon tou Christou.Then he puts the bread back onto the plate, kneels and adores.He rises, takes the chalice and raises it while saying:Calix meus inebrians quàm proeclaus est!Calicem Salutaris accipiam et nomen Domini invocabo.He kneels and adores.He rises and breaks a fragment of the spiritual body of Jesus and eats it. Hedrinks from the cup of blood.Pause. Organ plays.He then advances towards each of the Perfect in turn and offers the bread andthe cup to each.Silence. Organ. Adoration.Upon returning to the altar, the Bishop, extending his hands, proclaims:May the grace of the most holy Pleroma be with you always!The remains of the consecrated host are burned in the chafing-dish, for theessence of the body of the Lord should not be profaned.After this his Eminence gives the Gnostic benediction and retires between thetwo assistants who carry the candles.Appendix VICakes of LightIngredients:1. Wine leavings, or if these are difficult to find, substitute two litres (halfa gallon) of port wine2. One & a half cups of whole-wheat flour3. Honey (to taste)4. One & a half tablespoons of olive oil5. Abramelin oil (to taste - not much!)6. Other ingredient (see AL III, 23 & 24)Procedure:Wine leavings are a by-product of the wine manufacturing process, and may beobtained from a vineyard if you have one locally. Otherwise, buy a good portwine and reduce it. Heat the wine at the lowest heat possible. Steam should berising, but it should never boil. Let it simmer for approximately five hours. Atthe end you should have about a quarter of an inch (half a centimetre) of goo atthe bottom of the pot.Preheat the oven to a very high temperature.In a mixing bowl add the flour, honey, wine leavings/goo, olive oil, andAbramelin oil. Knead until it becomes cookie dough - this takes a while. Addmore flour if it’s too sticky. You can get Abramelin oil from an occult supplyshop - or ask your local O.T.O. body, frequently someone there will know how tomake it or procure it.Roll out the dough on to a floured surface. Flour the rolling pin and your handstoo. When the dough has been flattened out, take a small ball of it and add inthe Other Ingredient. Make the result into a small cake and bake in a very hotoven until it is black, or carcinate it with a bunsen burner (or any similarmethod for reducing it to ash).Allow this cake to cool, then crumble a small amount of the resultant ash intothe main dough. Do not add any of the raw Other Ingredient directly into themain dough, only use the burnt ash for this. Effectively you will be adding onlya homeopathic, carcinated amount of the Other Ingredient to the final mix.Reduce the oven temperature to 150°C (approximately 300°F, or Gas Mark 2).Take the dough mixture and cut into cakes using a small circular cutter- a pillbottle top or lipstick top is ideal.Place cakes on floured sheet and bake them in the oven for no more than fiveminutes. Usually 3-4 minutes is enough. The cakes won’t look done when you takethem out - just let them cool for a while and they’ll be fine, hardening as theycool.BibliographyApiryon, T, and Helena.
