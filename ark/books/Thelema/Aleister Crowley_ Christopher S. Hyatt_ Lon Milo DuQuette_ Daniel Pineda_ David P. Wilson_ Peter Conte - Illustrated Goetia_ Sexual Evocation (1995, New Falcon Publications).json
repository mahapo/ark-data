Humble thyself before thy Self, yet fear neither man norspirit. Fear is failure, and the forerunner of failure: and courage is thebeginning of virtue.”— Liber Librae XXXNew Falcon Publications herein reissues Aleister Crowley’s Illustrated Goetia.Those who work the Black Arts are thrilled.Those new to this world, enter.If you desire power over others, the attainment of love and riches, betterhealth, workings of sex-magic, and the excitement and danger of the Black Arts,this edition of the Goetia is for you. Along with the classical ritual text, itis packed with words of wisdom from coauthors Christopher Hyatt and Lon DuQuetteborne from personal experience of bringing forth these denizens of the pit tovisible appearance. Artist David Wilson has provided illustrations of hisvisions of these spirits and redrawn the seals originally included in Crowley’s1904 edition of the Goetia.Listed are the 72 Kings, Spirits, and Demons who can be bent to your Will, ifyou have the courage to summon them. They are described as Fallen Angels, havingpowers and abilities beyond the scope of what is thought possible of any humanbeing. Frightful in appearance, vile in behavior, and controllable only by themost powerful conjuror, the spirits of the Goetia are everything you wouldexpect from one of the most infamous texts on magical evocation.In this war, the battleground is the Circle and the Triangle.You will develop force of will, arrogance, cunning, selfishness,single-mindedness, obstinacy, greed, hunger, desire, fearlessness, intuition,and the power of wrath equal to these demons themselves. Being deficient in anyof these qualities will lead to a most painful and horrific disaster, butchances are you already have all these interesting personality traits, and whatyou seek is dominion over the Fallen and yourself.The smell of fear whets the appetites of the demons, loosening them from theadamantine chain formed by a proper conjuration. Any lack of focus or inabilityto fully become the exorcist you aspire to be, amuses the Spirits at yourexpense. Remember, they always show up when you call them, even if you don’trealize it. Regardless of how strange, or uneventful your experiments go, alwaysfinish the ritual.Many of these “infernal spirits” resent your calling them into the Triangle ofArt. It binds them temporarily to manifest according to your commands, and themagic itself binds them permanently to your spiritual destiny. They’ll doanything to ruin your ability to exert authority over them, from appearing inthe most disgusting forms, to emitting foul odors and fire from their mouths inan attempt to sicken and scare you. They’ll manipulate your mind, trying tocause doubt and wavering determination, but you must constrain them. They’llargue, plead, and whine their case of being unable to deliver on your demands,but you must force their obedience by maintaining control of yourself. They’lltry anything they can to repel your power over them, and the stronger you arethe more severe will be your trials.The efforts of the hosts of Hell to deter you from the call of destiny will beall for naught if you will but stand tall and command them with confidence. AsMaster of the Circle, you are the singularly most powerful force in the Universeat the time o f your ritual. Rule with a vengeance that forbids defeat, and asCrowley might say to you, “kick their ass, grab the goods, and have fun doingit.”Now don’t think that you can just go home and conjure away. You need a plan;there can be no “winging it” in the approach to dealing with these spirits.Thankfully the Goetia provides you with an ornate method that you can eitherfollow out to the letter or modify to suit your circumstance. Nonetheless, thereare certain guidelines and requirements that must be adhered to in all cases.This kind of power takes some time, effort, and a specific apparatus to control.There are security issues. Without the correct setup things could get very uglyindeed.Like in the case of the young magician who evoked the 15th spirit named Eligoswithout properly purifying and consecrating his workspace. The sigil jumped outof the triangle as a tree fell over, nearly crushing one of his assistants. Hehad to reinforce his link with the Holy Guardian Angel and risk being obsessedby the demon, while stepping outside the circle in order to recover the sigilthat had traveled about ten feet from its proper place. The spirit took controlof his vocal chords for a short time and began answering questions that thosepresent hadn’t yet asked. If the assistants were not highly trained initiatesand possessed of the utmost spiritual purity, it would have been much worse.They were all professionals, and that’s why that night is a success story andnot a tragic tale of just how bad things can get.Much like working in a chemistry lab, if you follow the prescribed method youwon’t run into anything you can’t handle. But unfortunately, most magicians skippast the preliminaries and drop the potassium right into a nice tall glass ofwater, thinking it will just fizz like a remedy for indigestion.You have to look, act, and speak the part of the Goetic Magician, as well ashave solid intention in all of your actions during the ritual. In short, youhave to be REAL.Taking the easy way in dealing with demons is to live the life of the averageperson— dressing up and going out for a night on the town to mingle with thefractured reflections of your own psychic complexes. Just take a look at theheadlines of tabloid magazines (masquerading as news publications), about therich, famous, and unintelligent (read career politicians and other societalleeches), who just can’t seem to do the right thing no matter how obvious it isto the rest of us. There are plenty of human demons roaming the streets,blogging on the Net, legislating on Capitol Hill, and skulking through thecorridors of the White House. But dealing with them is not the same as evokingthe Goetia, is it?Aleister Crowley, the Great Beast 666, the Prophet of Thelema, and the“Wickedest Man in the World,” debunked the charlatans, ignored the criticisms ofhis ineffectual contemporaries, and remains the one name out of the past tocapture and hold our fascinated attentions. In 1904 he commissioned S. L.MacGregor Mathers, a co-founder of the Order of the Golden Dawn, to translatethe first book of the Lesser Key of Solomon. Crowley then edited it into TheBook of the Goetia of Solomon the King. He eliminated those parts of the text hedeemed nonessential and kept what worked for him. He also added the EnochianCalls to his edition.Crowley didn’t consider the Goetia any more dangerous than the next system ofMagick, with the stipulation that ONLY doing the Goetia might sully your Magicalself and lock you qn to the level of the demons you want to deal with. Judge aman by the company he keeps. Balance is the foundation of both good Magick and agood life.Crowley, therefore, demands that you, the Magician, do the working known as “theattainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel.” Hecalled this the “Next Step” and saw it as part of his spiritual mission toeducate humanity on this point as thoroughly as possible. See Chapter Seven onthe Preliminary Invocation of the Goetia. [index_split_032.html#filepos120382]Learn what this is all about. Crowley was a prolific writer who explained theintricacies of his method for accomplishing the Great Work in his many books.Get your hands on them, read them, study them, practice them, and you will notbe disappointed.Also worthy are the works of Christopher S. Hyatt, Ph.D. (founder, publisher,and editor of New Falcon Publications), who has written many books that allowyou to advance in your quest for self-awareness. The Psychopath’s Bible, theBlack Books, Undoing Yourself with Energized Meditation, and Secrets of WesternTantra: The Sexuality of the Middle Path are four works that top the list. Thisedition of Aleister Crowley’s Illustrated Goetia: Sexual Evocation was one ofhis pride and joys. Lon DuQuette wrote for many years with Dr. Hyatt and haswritten a number of important books of his own since.You might ask yourself this question: Why, with all of the other styles ofMagical Workings available out there, should I do the Goetia? Here is theanswer. The results from the Goetia can be proven scientifically. It eitherdelivers what you want or it doesn’t. There’s no middle ground.The last chapter of this book by Hyatt and DuQuette teaches the ways of tranceand Sex Magick. Fun, Demons, and Sex? Well, yes and no. Sex is sex, and withsome talent and the right attitude, you can do that anywhere at anytime. SexualMagick takes both skill and knowledge of a very specific kind. There are manybooks on the subject. Buy them, read them, and practice what you learn. As itstates in the Book of the Law; “Success is thy proof’ (CCXX III, 42).Trance helps you to open yourself up to receive the information for which youare conjuring the Demon. The mirror exercise in Chapter Ten may scare the hellout o f you, but it sure is exciting, and, yes, that’s you in the mirror.The actual Sexual Workings require two people, the Medium and the Operator, whoTOTALLY trust each other. The two of you must be in sync. Although you couldjust jump into this with a stranger, the effect might not be what you expect.The major problem will always be ensuring that both partners are working onattaining the same thing, yet are detached from result. If possible, practicewith someone who shares your values and vision. You can’t give the Demons mixedsignals or they’re going to go to town on the two of you.The Medium must be as open as possible, to the point of oblivion, to gamerinformation from the Spirit in the Triangle. He or she, as the Receiver, istotally defenseless, being totally dependent on the Operator for protection. TheMaster of the Circle, as the Operator, is to keep an eye on the Demon, makingsure that it isn’t about to create any problems for the two of you.There might be situations where you are invited to participate in a groupworking of the Goetia. It must be a carefully chosen group of experiencedmagicians as described earlier, trustworthy people you know (remember that theinitiatory traditions insist that we qualify our friends). For a great exampleof group Goetic-style evocation, see Crowley’s Liber 325: The Bartzabel Working.Chapter Six presents you with “minimum requirements” for this or any Working.The Temple must be clean. That means soap and water, a little elbow grease,incense, and maybe a little salt in the comers which will keep any negativityout of them. Oh, and the room has to be empty. Don’t cheat yourself here; themoment you begin to make the preparations, the ritual has already begun andeverything said earlier about intention and focus applies.The OTHER Temple of your body, mind, and spirit will also need to be dulycleansed and purified. A Magical bath with the correct mindset, clear of thedaily grind and personal life problems, will go a long way toward preparing youfor the work ahead. Having all your tools available in the Circle and knowingall of your incantations, especially the Lesser Banishing Ritual of thePentagram (given here in the Appendix), are all important elements of a safe andfruitful operation. There are no time-outs while you fumble with your notes, somake sure you are familiar with the material BEFORE calling on one of the Fallento do your bidding. Trying to look up a crucial piece of wording as the Demon,delighted by the disruption, prepares to wreak havoc, is not the best of ideas.The Circle must be cast in a Ceremonial rather than a Wicean design. A mistakehere is a real security risk. It marks the difference between High and LowMagick. Don’t judge one to be better than the other. They’re just differentgeographies of the same Occult World. In both methods, the concept of the Circlecontains power, and that power emanates from you. To learn the Ceremonial Magickstyle of the Circle read Crowley’s Magick, Liber ABA, or Israel Regardie’s, TheComplete Golden Dawn System of Magic (available from New Falcon Publications).Whether in the Circle or out on the street, a good magician carries and projectsthis energy from himself outward.Take pride in how your Temple area looks. if you don’t set up the design of theTemple correctly, disaster awaits you. You could use masking tape for the Circleand the Triangle, but in the sweltering heat of a humid August the tape maybegin to curdle, and said Demon will have its opportunity to rip on out of thatTriangle as the tape detaches itself. The lesson here is, of course, don’t becheap. In Magick one must “buy a perfectly black hen, without haggling.” Draw onthe floor a permanent set up that has personal significance for you. You can usewhat is offered in this book or put in the names of the God Forces that you areaccustomed to. Whatever you do, look sharp and act strongly.In order to assume the role of Master of the circle, it is important to wear abeautiful robe that has been laundered and neatly kept. Some jewelry is also inorder. What good is being an Occultist if you can’t strut your stuff and flashall that impressive bling? You’ll need a Pentagram of Solomon to wear; this canbe had at the local Occult store, or by mail order, or you can create your own.As this is a required piece of equipment, you have no choice but to acquire one.The other piece of jewelry is the most important part of your magical persona,the Ring. The Ring protects the Magician from the foul odors, fiery breaths, andnegative vibes directed at you from the Demon. It doesn’t have to be of aMagical design. Anything that looks good to you and, more so, screams out to theworld “This is me, deal with it!” is correct. You can mix and match metals andstones. Remember, a Ring is only as powerful as the Magician wearing it. Thebook says that you can use a piece of paper with the correct design on it, butits important not to be cheap as you are risking your life when you do this sortof thing. The Ring is a symbol of your immense power and is to be worn withpride. Feel like something special? Well, you are. Now that you’re all dressedup and raring to go, let’s conjure.Or not. You have to ask yourself, “Is this Ritual really necessary?” If you canattain your goal on your own by hard work and natural abilities, then do so. Youdon’t want to get a reputation among the Fallen Angels as a poser. They’ll takea lackluster view of you, and, when ordered to perform your tasks, demonstrate alack of oomph in doing so.You must ask yourself before any Ritual these four questions: Can I justify myactions? Do I feel strongly about attaining my goal? Can I focus my Will withoutany doubts about what I am doing? Do I have the Courage to step into the Circleand do it? If you can answer these questions in the affirmative, then continuein your working of Magic Art.The Sigils, as redrawn by David Wilson, appear on each demon’s personal page.You’ll use them to dial up the spirits. Follow Crowley’s recipe on how to dothis. The other value of the Sigils is that you can go (if possible) to whereyou’d like the Demon to perform and help out by mentally projecting the Sigil atthe person or place that’s the target. It’s up to you to make sure that thingswill happen. Just don’t lie back in an easy chair and wait. You’re the Generalof this army, and you must lead.It’s also useful to get to know the Demons. A careful reading of the massiveChapter Eight will help, as will any additional research you do. Did you knowthat the Demons are stars in many movies, antagonists in books, andpersonalities on the nightly news? You can really get a gist of their traits byobserving them in the many computer games which use them that may or may notreflect their true behavior.The Demons also represent the various aspects of our subconscious minds. Wedon’t know what goes on in there and most are afraid to look. By performing theGoetia rituals, we are exploring ourselves. Anything that you can learn aboutthe science and operation of the brain and mind will give you more ammo in yourMagical quest.A word of warning to you: The study of the Psychology of the mind is useful. Thestudy of your mind by the Psychologist is dangerous. If you’re going to stepthrough the curtain and consort with demons and declare yourself a Magician, the“Norms” out there are going lock you away. Read The Psychopath’s Bible torealize the pitfalls of being different. You’re not really different than theyare. You just won’t lie to yourself about wanting power and being unafraid aboutgetting it. Also, don’t be afraid of that voice in your head. It’s yourIntuition. Well, sometimes it’s the Demon’s voice, but ultimately it’s stillyou.Learn to keep that big mouth shut and listen. Pythagoras had his would-befollowers take a vow of silence that would last up to five years. Silence is thelast of the Four Powers of the Sphinx, and Harporcrates, the Lord of Silence, isalso the lord of defense.A mob in ancient India was chasing down a youth who had openly proclaimed thesecrets of the Universe. When he finally outran them, he went to his Guru andasked him how he had survived living alongside such barbarians for so manyyears. The Guru answered, “I know who to share my stories with.”You can be your own best friend or your own worst enemy. In the end there’s onlyyou."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONEThe Nature of EvilThe purpose of this section is to stimulate, through metaphor and analogy, anunderstanding of Goetic operations and the concept of Evil. Through metaphor, wecan only paint a picture. The shapes and colors can only be realized throughmeditation on the metaphors and doing the work itself. There is no substitutefor the latter, and, while many have not practiced Goetic evocation asclassically described, they have evoked “unawares,” over and over again, thesame powerful forces and demons which have both helped and hindered them.Like many of you I have “made up” my own rituals and have given my own names tothese forces. At times I have given them proper names such as John, my neighbor,when his T.V. is too loud. At other times I have called these forces mother,friend, the system “It” or “me.”Sometimes I have benefited from “calling” these “Names” and sometimes I havesuffered. Yet, neither benefit nor pain has caused me to reject the “howlings”1[index_split_011.html#filepos44320] and simply seek the comfort of “High Magick”alone. If I stand for anything, it is the acceptance of everything, (except,perhaps, for the hypocrisy demonstrated by many magicians and mystics who seekthe light by running away from darkness).Goetia is sometimes thought of as a wild card, something that can get out ofcontrol, something which expresses the operator’s lower desires to controlothers and improve his own personal life. And in fact this potential loss ofcontrol, this danger, the desire for self improvement and great power is exactlywhat attracts many people to Goetia while horrifying and repelling others. Manylabel Goetia as simply evil.Finding evil is a easy job. Just look at your friend, wife, husband, mother,father or for that matter the “guy” next door. The practice of Goetia is thatother guy, something dark, mysterious and powerful, something which tells theworld that you are interested in yourself, interested in mastery as well assurrender (see Chapter Two in Sex Magick, Tantra and Tarot: The Way of TheSecret Lover, New Falcon Publications, 1996 for an explanation of surrender andmastery).Those who have disowned themselves and fear themselves often consider Goeticpractices to be evil of the worst kind. Goetia is often thought of as aninvitation to madness, the releasing of devouring and frightful forces. WhatGoetia is—is the releasing of yourself from your own fears and illusions bydirect confrontation. Goetic evocation is an invitation to flirt with theambiguous relationship of “mind” and “matter.” Remember, no one knows the truenature or actions of either and thus all arguments as to the “reality” of Goeticspirits are speculative and open to revision.The question remains: What is evil? Some experts believe it is the intentionaldoing of harm without redemption. While this definition might provide theseexperts with a sense of comfort it provides me with little. It is too easy toplay with words and ideas. For example according to this definition, Hitlermight not be considered evil since some people believe that without hispersecution of the Jews, Israel would not have been founded in the late forties.There is always some “good” which our “cause” and “order” crazed mind can findto rationalize or justify a horrible or unfortunate event.Evil is an “externalization” and “objectification” of something fearful,horrifying, or different. Evil can be a label for something as simple as aperson or an object that frustrates us. Evil is pain. Evil is the enemy. Evil isthe Gods of other men. Evil is the night terrors. Evil is the overwhelmingfeeling of falling apart. Yet all these images are non-sense. Evil like otherideas exists because we as humans exist. Nature knows not Evil, neither Good,nor for that matter Law. These are creations of the human mind, “explanations”which help us quiet the “terrors of the night.” The human mind requires thebelief in “its” idea of “order” for the sole purposes of the human mind. Thusthe nature of evil is the human mind.Each of us are full of doubts, frustrations, fears and anxieties. These demonsof the soul are the hidden parts of our self. They are the disowned self, muchlike Goetia is the often disowned part of Magick. We normally don’t present ourdark side to others. Rarely, will anyone tell you their weak points let alonetheir deepest concerns. It is much easier and frequently less painful to finddarkness outside of oneself.What I present to the world, or for that matter what anyone presents, is at besta well-crafted ideal image, something desired, hoped for, something my brain andculture have helped create. Our mask is an illusion, a piece of the truth, anecessary one, but none the less only a piece of the truth."},{"pageContent":"CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY AND GOETIA EVOCATIONPsychology, particularly therapeutic psychology, deals with people’s fears anddoubts. Psychologists label many of these fears as pathology. Psychologists havecarefully followed in the footsteps of the Priest, who in his non-scientific butsimple way labelled these things as evil or demonic possession. The averageclinical psychologist is no more scientific than the priest.In the depths of the psychotherapeutic cave, the therapist assists the patientin evoking the rejected and hidden parts of his psyche. The greatest danger forthe therapist, and for the patient, is the therapist’s counter-transference.When this counter-transference remains unconscious or gets “out of control,”therapy becomes dangerous and ineffective. The complexes (demons) of both thetherapist and the patient are mixing in an archaic cauldron. All sorts ofdangers are thought to be lurking. Sex becomes a strong possibility; so areviolent outbreaks. Remember, these dangers are thought to be a result of thetherapist’s (the operator) losing control of the contents of his own unconsciousprocesses, idealized fantasies, unfulfilled wishes and disowned attributes. Oncethis happens, it is believed that both the therapist and patient are adrift on astormy sea in a sinking lifeboat.The horrors and fears of counter-transference are so great that many State Lawsexplicitly prohibit “dual relationships” between therapist and patient.; i.e.,the therapist and patient may not become involved in relationships outside thesafety of the therapeutic model. Dual relationships are thought of as a crossingof role boundaries between the therapist and patient. It is believed that strictboundaries are necessary between the patient and therapist in order for thepatient’s cure. This is based on the theory that the patient’s disease wascaused by the breaking of proper boundaries in childhood.The psychotherapeutic situation contains boundaries, strict ones set down bylaw, historical precedent, and theory.The therapist becomes a mirror for the patient upon which the patient’s highestaspirations and ideals as well as his disowned “shadowy” qualities can beprojected. It is believed by some that the “working through” of both the “dark”and “ideal” illusions are fundamental to the patient seeing himself as well asothers correctly, instead of the images and distorted fantasies originating andfixed in childhood.The disappointment the patient feels when his illusions are crushed can beoverwhelming. When his illusions of the therapist are crushed, his ownself-illusions are threatened. The patient is both angry and depressed. If thetherapist is a good “operator,” he knows how to help the patient “crush” hisillusions. He helps the patient free himself from his projections and splits. Heknows how to help the patient realize that the therapist has both “good” and“bad” qualities and that these diverse qualities can reside in the same personat the same time. The therapist does not have to be worshipped or rejected.Either/Or is the disease. Once the patient realizes this, he also “knows” thatthe same truth applies to himself. He is neither his ideal nor his darkness.These obvious realizations, however, cannot occur in a cool and objective way;for resolution to occur it often manifests in the heat, and sometimesexhaustion, o f intense emotion. Power and force are necessary, and whether thismanifests in extreme feeling or behavior or simply in moods and “neurotic” testsmatters little. It matters only that they must manifest themselves, and theoperator, by the definition of the situation, must stimulate them and in someway control them. He often stimulates them by breaking a taboo either in fact orby implication. He often teases and bribes the patient to be “naughty.”Sometimes the patient is the operator and the therapist is the receiver. Infact, these roles change, but not in a simple way. The therapist sometimes is“blank”—just receiving from the patient. At other times, the therapist is“active” while the patient receives images and conveys them back to thetherapist in disguised forms.What you have just read may sound contradictory: strict boundaries, deliberateviolations of boundaries, the situation itself eliciting tests of boundaries,firm boundaries, fluid boundaries. In some sense it all sounds quite “crazy:”projection, illusion, reality, boundaries, violations of trust freeing a personfrom the prison of his soul. Yet while sounding strange and often unscientific,if performed properly the desired results can occur. And what again are thedesired results? One person helping another achieve what he most desperatelywants and at the same time most desperately fears: control over his own life,freedom from devastating and repetitive illusions, freedom from reliving thepast over and over again in the present. Real therapy teaches the patient how toembrace the whole of life, rejecting nothing, seeing the limitations of hisideals as well as the utility of his weaknesses. Real therapy teaches the art ofviolation, the breaking of taboos, opening the gates of both heaven and hell.Real therapy teaches style."},{"pageContent":"TABOOSBoundaries can be thought of as taboos. (See Taboo: Sex, Religion and Magic, NewFalcon Publications, 2000.) Taboos are acts, places and things which no one,except maybe the priest, can touch without punishment. Taboos are “dirty.”People who break taboos are thought of as dirty, evil people. Yet, in oursociety is it not the “dirty” the dark which attracts attention? The garbagecollector is highly paid for removing the leftovers of living. The bank clerkwho handles hundreds of thousands of “dirty” dollars is paid less than thegarbage collector. What is the nature of dirt, the common, which at the sametime is valued and despised by so many? Money can do the bidding of anyone whohas it. Money itself is only a shared illusion. It has no value except whatpeople give it and it has no power except by what people do with it. Thefluidity, malleability and indifference of money gives it a power unlike almostany other power in the world. Money sets boundaries and destroys them. Moneyitself doesn’t care. And in this sense money is similar to the Goetia demons.They will work for anyone who knows how to use them. This is one of the horrorspeople attribute to Goetic workings. You “don’t have to be respectable” forGoetia to work for you. Unlike other magical workings there is no implicationthat the operator has to be “good” and “holy” to achieve results. This idea initself violates our model of “right” and “wrong,” “just” and “unjust.” In theGoetic world like in the real world the “bad” can and do prosper. Thus ourbelief in the moral order of the Universe appears violated by the simpleexistence of Spirits who will do the bidding of anyone.Goetic evocation is the rejected “less respectable” side of magick. It is thework of the garbage collector. But it is also the most intimate side of themagick. It teaches the establishment of boundaries, of testing, of bribing, oflying and deceit. It provides the. operator and the receiver with visions,suggestions and insights,. It actualizes the hidden, the dark, the greedy, theneedy, the powerful and beautiful.Goetic evocation can be very disappointing, sometimes even horrifying, but itcan never be boring. Unlike a child who determines the value of its knowledge bythe approval or disapproval of a “higher authority” we learn the value of ourGoetic work by the success or failure of our own work. Goetic Spirits are notthe master of the magician but his servant. We do not rely on the “Spirits” perse to tell us that we did well. Goetia work is more “scientific” than otherforms of magick in terms of our ability to measure its effects and, to someextent, replicate our results.Goetic workings can also be potentiated by the use of hypnosis and sex. Tranceand “exhaustion” resulting from sexual ecstasy are perfect methods for preparingthe mind to receive more meaningful and powerful information.In this book on Goetia, we have provided the student with a simple to use texton how to begin and become expert at Goetia evocation. We have included imagesof the Goetia Spirits, not to limit the student, but to stimulate his or herimagination. We have organized the text in such a way that the student doesn’thave to flip through dozens of pages to find what he wants or needs.Equally important, we have provided a technique for the sexual working of theGoetia Spirits. This is a very powerful and sensual method. I have no doubt thatsome readers will be terrified and horrified at the potential power thesetechniques will release. We feel, however, that if you desire to practice magickyou should practice it to its fullest. Safeguards have been provided, and thereal dangers lie more in the mind than in the use of the methods.1 [index_split_009.html#filepos30025]“Goetia means ‘howling’; but is thetechnical word employed to cover all the operations of that Magick which dealswith gross, malignant or unenlightened forces.”— Aleister Crowley"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWOThe Initiated Interpretation of Ceremonial Magickby Aleister CrowleyIt is loftily amusing to the student of Magical literature who is not quite afool—and rare is such a combination!—to note the criticism directed by thePhilistine against the citadel ofhis science. Truly, since our childhood has ingrained into us not only literalbelief in the Bible, but also substantial belief in Alf Laylah wa Laylah (AThousand and One Arabian Nights), and only adolescence can cure us, we are onlytoo liable, in the rush and energy of dawning manhood, to overturn roughly andrashly both these classics, to regard them both on the same level, asinteresting documents from the standpoint of folk-lore and anthropology, and asnothing more.Even when we learn that the Bible, by a profound and minute study of the text,may be forced to yield up Qabalistic arcana of cosmic scope and importance, weare too often slow to apply a similar restorative to the companion volume, evenif we are the luck holders of Burton’s veritable edition.To me, then, it remains to raise the Alf Laylah wa Laylah into its proper placeonce more.I am not concerned to deny the objective reality of all “magical” phenomena; ifthey are illusions, they are at least as real as many unquestioned facts ofdaily life; and, if we follow Herbert Spencer, they are at least evidence ofsome cause.2Now, this fact is our base. What is the cause of my illusion of seeing a spiritin the triangle of Art?Every smatterer, every expert in psychology, will answer: “That cause lies inyour brain.”English children (pace the Education Act) are taught that the Universe lies ininfinite Space; Hindu children, in the Akasa, which is the same thing.Those Europeans who go a little deeper learn from Fichte, that the phenomenalUniverse is the creation of the Ego; Hindus, or Europeans studying under Hindugurus, are told, that by Akasa is meant the Chitakasa. The Chitakasa is situatedin the “Third Eye,” i.e., in the brain. By assuming higher dimensions of space,we can assimilate this fact to Realism; but we have no need to take so muchtrouble.This being true for the ordinary Universe, that all sense-impressions aredependent on changes in the brain,3 we must include illusions, which are afterall sense-impressions as much as “realities” are, in the class of “phenomenadependent on brain-changes.”Magical phenomena, however, come under a special sub-class, since they arewilled, and their cause is the series of “real” phenomena called the operationsof ceremonial Magic.These consist of:(1) Sight.> > > The circle, square, triangle, vessels, lamps robes, implements, etc.(2) Sound.> > > The invocations.(3) Smell.> > > The perfumes.(4) Taste.> > > The Sacraments.(5) Touch.> > > As under (1).(6) Mind.> > > The combination of all these and reflection on their significance.These unusual impressions (1-5) produce unusual brain-changes; hence theirsummary (6) is of unusual kind. Its projection back into the apparentlyphenomenal world is therefore unusual.Herein then consists the reality of the operations and effects of ceremonialmagic,4 and I conceive that the apology is ample, as far as the “effects” referonly to those phenomena which appear to the magician himself, the appearance ofthe spirit, his conversation, possible shocks from imprudence, and so on, evento ecstasy on the one hand, and death or madness on the other.But can any of the effects described in this our book Goetia5 be obtained, andif so, can you give a rational explanation of the circumstances? Say you so?I can, and will.The spirits of the Goetia are portions of the human brain.Their seals therefore represent (Mr. Spencer’s projected cube) methods ofstimulating or regulating those particular spots (through the eye).The names of God are vibrations calculated to establish: 1. (a) General control of the brain. (Establishment of functions relative to the subtle world.) 2. (b) Control over the brain in detail. (Rank or type of the Spirit.) 3. (c) Control of one special portion. (Name of the Spirit.)The perfumes aid this through smell. Usually the perfume will only tend tocontrol a large area; but there is an attribution of perfumes to letters of thealphabet enabling one, by a Qabalistic formula, to spell out the Spirit’s name.I need not enter into more particular discussion of these points; theintelligent reader can easily fill in what is lacking.If, then, I say, with Solomon:“The Spirit Cimieries teaches logic,” what I mean is:“Those portions of my brain which subserve the logical faculty may be stimulatedand developed by following out the processes called ‘The Invocation ofCimieries.’ ”And this is a purely materialistic rational statement; it is independent of anyobjective hierarchy at all. Philosophy has nothing to say; and Science can onlysuspend judgment, pending a proper and methodical investigation of the factsalleged.Unfortunately, we cannot stop there. Solomon promises us that we can (1) obtaininformation; (2) destroy our enemies; (3) understand the voices of nature; (4)obtain treasure; (5) heal diseases, etc. I have taken these five powers atrandom; considerations of space forbid me to explain all. 1. (1) Brings up facts from sub-consciousness. 2. (2) Here we come to an interesting fact. It is curious to note the contrast between the noble means and the apparently vile ends of magical rituals. The latter are disguises for sublime truths. “To destroy our enemies” is to realize the illusion of duality, to excite compassion.(Ah! Mr. Waite, the world of Magic is a mirror, wherein who sees muck is muck.) 1. (3) A careful naturalist will understand much from the voices of the animals he has studied long. Even a child knows the difference of a cat’s miauling and purring. The faculty may be greatly developed. 2. (4) Business capacity may be stimulated. 3. (5) Abnormal states of the body may be corrected, and the involved tissues brought back to tone, in obedience to currents started from the brain.So for all other phenomena. There is no effect which is truly and necessarilymiraculous.Our Ceremonial Magic fines down, then, to a series of minute, though of courseempirical, physiological experiments, and whoso will carry them throughintelligently need not fear the result.I have all the health, and treasure, and logic, I need; I have no time to waste.“There is a lion in the way.” For me these practices are useless; but for thebenefit of others less fortunate I give them to the world, together with thisexplanation of, and apology for, them.I trust that the explanation will enable many students who have hitherto, by apuerile objectivity in their view of the question, obtained no results, tosucceed; that the apology may impress upon our scornful men of science that thestudy of the bacillus should give place to that of the baculum, the little tothe great—how great one only realizes when one identifies the wand with theMahalingam, up which Brahma flew at the rate of 84,000 yojanas a second for84,000 mahakalpas6, down which Vishnu flew at the rate of 84,000 croces ofyojanas a second for 84,000 crores of mahakalpas—yet neither reached an end.But I reach an end.Boleskine House,Foyers, N.B.2 This, incidentally, is perhaps the greatest argument we possess, pushed to itsextreme, against the Advaitist theories.3 Thought is a secretion of the brain (Weissmann).

On a scale of spiritual practices one might findGoetia sandwiched somewhere between “Pacts with the Devil” and “addiction to theOuija board.”This attitude is understandable. After all, Goetia is the intentionalconjuration of spiritual beings who are, by definition, Fallen Angels, EvilSpirits and Demons!From their infernal abodes these naughty Spirits are called forth to act aspersonal servants to the Goetic magician to extend his power and execute hiswill on Earth. The magician must be ever vigilant to the wiles of the Spirits.If he is unskilled or loses control even for an instant, he runs the risk ofbeing obsessed, possessed or even destroyed. This sounds uncomfortably likeBlack Magick.Such behavior is certainly beneath the altruistic purity of purpose thatcharacterize the quest and disciplines of High Magick and can serve only tobring out the lowest qualities of the practitioner’s character...So goes the argument against Goetic evocation and, so far as it goes, it is apoint well taken.Yes, the Spirits in question are of the “infernal” variety. But exactly whatdoes that mean? If we embrace, for a moment, the popular nomenclature of HighMagick, “infernal” relates to the subconscious stratum of the human psyche.Spirits inhabiting these regions would then be the personifications of powers orenergies that lie buried in our subconscious minds—qualities of ourconsciousness that we have disowned. They are Fallen because they have slippedfrom the conscious control of the deity—ourselves.Yes, they are dangerous because while they remain unmastered they can surfaceunbidden and wreak all the havoc modern psychology blames on “things hidden inthe subconscious mind.”To the charge that such practices bring out the worst qualities in the magician’s character, the Goetic practitioner pleads “guilty,” pointing out that this isprecisely the purpose of this variety of evocation. If these disowned qualitiesare not brought forth, identified and controlled, the magician, like the rest ofhumanity, is doomed to be at the mercy and the caprice of his own subconsciousdemons, never being allowed the opportunity to subdue these denizens of hispsychic menagerie.But are the Spirits of the Goetia simply subjective components of the magician’smind, or is there really an independent objective quality to their natures? Thisfundamental question may never receive a satisfactory answer due to the factthat no one really understands the nature of “matter.” But one thing is certain:one who has never experienced a Goetic Evocation is not qualified to voice eventhe most educated opinion on the subject. It is one thing to be well-read on asubject; it is quite another to be part of the subject itself. It is anunfortunate fact that there are many individuals who make magick their lifewithout making their life magick. Even the most talented and brilliantexpounders of the Art sometimes lose sight of this and focus instead onhistorical or technical aspects of the subject to such a degree that they ignorecompletely its relevance to their daily life and happiness.In light of this, I feel it would be helpful to relate the circumstancessurrounding my first Goetic evocation. I beg the reader’s attention to whatfollows because I feel that it contains many of the major components necessaryfor a successful Goetic Evocation. (I have omitted the name of my former “magickteacher” as it would be recognized by a great many readers.)"},{"pageContent":"WITH MY BACK AGAINST A WALLIt was 1975 and I had never been so desperate in my life. My decision to end a “successful” fourteen year career in music had been one of life and death—mine.It was either continue a lifestyle that was destroying my health and myrelationship with my wife and young son, or risk not being able to support them.I was trained for nothing practical. Even my college education, such as it was,was as a Drama major. The pocket change I was still earning from recordingroyalties and guitar lessons wasn’t enough to feed us let alone pay the rent andthe bills. I had no job, no car, no money, no prospects... no hope.One of the few bright spots that characterized this period was my discovery ofthe writings of Aleister Crowley and my involvement the disciplines ofceremonial magick.Since the mid-60’s I had been a student of Eastern Mysticism and WesternHermeticism, and my interests had finally brought me into contact with a magicalsociety that I had believed long extinct. I passionately involved myself in thisgroup and subsequently became the student of one of its senior officers.A charming woman in her fifties, she continually impressed me with what Iperceived to be her balanced, logical approach to the subject of magick. Herteacher had been a personal student of Aleister Crowley and had even been aresident at his (in)famous Abbey of Thelema in Cefalu Sicily in the 1920’s. Iwas thrilled to be a link in such an historic magical chain and my spiritualpractices became the entire focus of my life. Periodically my teacher reviewedmy diaries and we maintained constant correspondence. I also visited her asoften as I could.However, my deteriorating situation on the material plane was a source of majoranxiety and the distraction inevitably began to affect my ability to concentrateon my “spiritual” practices.What was the use of all this study if I couldn’t use it in a practical way toimprove my life? My teacher cautioned me not to mix my planes. “If you need ajob, go out and get a job.” she wrote. “Learn to walk before you attempt torun.” Performing magick to help get a job was, in her words, “low magick” andwould distract from the Great Work that I was pledged to perform.I could not make it clear to her that I was trying to improve my situation bynormal means, but I also felt the need to magically “lubricate” the situation.Obviously there was a great stumbling block before me and, after all, didn’t theesoteric Wisdom of the Ages teach us to look first in ourselves for suchobstacles?I was familiar with The Lesser Key of Solomon—The Goetia7—and it seemed to methat many of the seventy-two Spirits (if one considered them actual entities,capable of effecting change on the material plane) could provide such help. Iwanted to perform a Goetic evocation for the purpose of improving the conditionsof my material life.This suggestion to my teacher evoked in her an almost hysterical response. Shetold me in no uncertain terms that I was not ready to practice any form ofGoetic evocation. She stressed that only magicians who had already achieved thehighest levels of illumination were qualified to do so. “Once you achieve theKnowledge and Conversation of your Holy Guardian Angel you will see all of thisas unnecessary.”But how could I obtain the mental and emotional equilibrium necessary to achievesuch lofty spiritual heights while my life remained so screwed up? Is itrequired by the Gods that illumination comes only to the illuminated?I did not wish to be disrespectful to her yet I was sensing a real blind spot inour relationship.When I asked her if she had ever performed a Goetic evocation she answered,“Certainly not! That is Low Magick.”7 The Book of the Goetia of Solomon the King Translated into the English Tongueby a Dead Hand and Adorned with Divers Other Matters Germane Delightful to theWise, the Whole Edited, Verified, Introduced and Commented by AleisterCrowley—Society for the Propagation of Religious Truth, Boleskine, Foyers,Inverness, Scotland, 1904."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURFirst EvocationFor for the next nine months I continued my disciplines of “High Magick,” risingin the pre-dawn hours for yoga, pranayama and ceremonial work with the pentagramand hexagram rituals. I enjoyed the work very much and kept a detailed magicaldiary and dream records. I constructed and consecrated my magical weapons, mixedthe Holy Oil of Abramelin and memorized the recommended texts. My teacher seemedpleased with my progress.By the Fall of 1976, my situation in the “real” world had degenerated terribly.I didn’t have a car or a telephone and that made job hunting difficult. Thetemporary positions I did manage to secure were so far away that what littlethey paid was all but taken up by the expense of getting there.To say that I was distracted by my anxiety would be a cruel understatement. Myself esteem was at an all-time low and I began to entertain thoughts too dark torelate. My back was against the wall.As a last resort and against my teacher’s instructions, I decided to perform aGoetic evocation with the expressed purpose of turning my life around andachieving some level of mastery over my existence. I wrote in my diary, “I mustsucceed, because the consequences of failure at this point are unthinkable.”I turned my attention to the only Goetic text available to me at that time. Iwent down the list of the Spirits and their attributes and settled on # 55:"},{"pageContent":"OROBAS> > The Fifty-fifth Spirit is Orobas.

He governs 20 Legions of Spirits.Orobas seemed ideal for my needs. First I lacked the “dignity” to properly carefor myself and my family. (At the time I had no idea what “prelacies” meant.)Second, in order to pull my life together I would need the favor of both friendsand foes. Third, because of my studies, I needed confidence in my divinatoryabilities and a good understanding of the Holy Qabalah. Finally I needed aSpirit in whom I could trust. Orobas seemed like the perfect Magical side-kick.Orobas it would be.Next I had to come to grips with the Temple set up, equipment and the method ofevocation.The Temple was easy. I could use my son’s bedroom (the only bedroom in ourlittle apartment). Using thin masking tape, I created a circle about nine feetin diameter on the floor. Upon the circle I placed the Holy Names; for me theseincluded the names from the Thelemic Pantheon: Nuit, Hadit, Ra-Hoor Khuit,Babalon, Therion. I made the Triangle from posterboard and enclosed it with whatI felt were appropriate names (Thelema, Agape and Abrahadabra).The equipment was improvised and not at all the glamorous magical accoutermentsI had always pictured: an inexpensive Indian incense burner smoked in theTriangle near a paper facsimile of the seal of Orobas; I scratched the samefigure upon the medallion that hung from my neck (the flip side engraved withthe pentagram of Solomon); a cup of water for purification; a candle forconsecration; Oil of Abramelin to anoint myself and the Temple, and, of course,my magick book.I had a real problem with the conjurations as they appeared in The Lesser Key ofSolomon. I was sure that it would be unnecessary for me to mindlessly parrot thetedious series of conjurations precisely as they are written in the text. Theendless intonations are obviously intended to do two things: (1) reinforce theoperator’ s belief that he has a “divine right” to call forth and control theSpirit and (2) put the operator in an altered state of consciousness whereby hecan see and communicate with the Spirit. I was confident that I could achieveboth these states without the tiresome archaic language and the references toOld Testament characters for whom I had neither emotional attachment norrespect.I resolved to simply perform a thorough banishing, then open the Temple withCrowley’s Preliminary Invocation of the Goetia (see Chapter Seven[index_split_032.html#filepos120382]), which I had already memorized as part ofthe ceremonies of the consecration of my magical weapons. Then, “intoxicated” bythe Barbarous Words of Evocation, I would simply concentrate upon the Triangleand call forth Orobas extempore.The Charge was to be a simple one. Orobas was to immediately do whatever wasnecessary to help me gain Control over my life. I needed to attain the dignityto safeguard the well being of myself and my wife and child; Orobas was toremain as my familiar, executing my orders without bringing harm to me or myloved ones. In return I would be a kind master and promise, if he remainedobedient and faithful, to exalt his seal and his name and redeem his spirit evenas my spirit is redeemed.All being ready in the bedroom Temple, I prepared myself to evoke Orobas.It had been unseasonably warm all day and by late afternoon (when I was ready tooperate) the Temple was very hot. After a long ceremonial bath I put on my robewith the obligatory “By the figurative mystery of this holy vestment...” andtook my position in the circle.I removed the stopper from the vial of Oil of Abramelin (by tradition the mostpowerful of Holy Oils, made from 8 parts cinnamon oil, 4 parts myrrh oil, 2parts oil of galangal, 7 parts olive oil). I anointed the top of my head, thenmy forehead, throat, heart, solar plexus, navel and groin areas. Wherever ittouched my skin, the oil burned like fire and made me excitedly conscious of mypsychic centers.With my Almond Wand I performed the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagramthen proceeded with the Preliminary Invocation of the Goetia. This completed, Ibegan to concentrate upon the seal in the Triangle and “call” Orobas.I don’t know what I expected. Nothing was happening. I called Orobas again, thistime more forcefully. Still nothing. Disappointment began to settle upon me andI started to feel all the frustration that had brought me to this point. Ibecame impatient and angry. I pointed my Wand toward the Triangle and shouted,“get in the Triangle God damn it or I’ll burn your little-ass seal to a crisp.If you aren’t for me you’re against me and I would just as soon annihilate youthan argue with you.”For the first time in my life I had “someone” to vent all my anger andfrustration upon. It felt good. It felt very good to yell at and threatensomeone or something I held responsible for all my ills.I don’t know how long I raved at that empty cardboard Triangle but suddenly Ifelt silly. I stopped and took a deep breath. I felt my heart pounding in mythroat and I was covered with sweat. In the hot, heavy calm something washappening. I didn’t see anything but something definitely was in the room withme. It was like the feeling you get when you are awakened from a nap sensing youare not alone, only to discover that your dog is staring at you.It was in the Triangle. I didn’t see it with my eyes like a cartoon or hologram.I saw it like one “sees” an idea—as if it were projected upon the inside back ofmy skull: a little horse with large sad eyes staring at me like an abused packanimal. Orobas.I now felt self-conscious, almost embarrassed. Its presence was as objectivelyperceptible as if another conscious Being stood before me. A Being with anindependent existence and feelings. I sensed also that it unquestionablyresented being confined in the Triangle.So stunned was I that for a moment I forgot everything. I completely lost myattitude of superior indignation. Now I was fearful that I would be unable tocontrol the situation. “As long as I stare at the Triangle with all myconcentrated will,” I thought, “I will stay in control.”No sooner had this thought crossed my mind than a bead of sweat from my brow ranover the bridge of my nose and into my right eye. I blinked several times, thenrubbed both eyes with the fingers of my left hand. Suddenly my eyes began to bumso badly that I couldn’t keep them open. I instantly realized what I had done.The sweat from my forehead was saturated with Oil of Abramelin. My fingers werecovered in it. I was rubbing concentrated cinnamon oil into my own eyes!The pain was excruciating and getting worse by the second. I was completelyblinded. I panicked. I couldn’t go on with the evocation like this nor could Irisk further breach of procedure by breaking the Circle. The old rage returned.With my eyes squeezed tightly together I turned toward the Triangle and spat amindless curse at Orobas. I blamed this all on him and vowed to arrange aneternity of confinement and torment if he didn’t remain in the Triangle.I knew that I had no choice but to blindly find my way to the bathroom and washmy eyes. Then the most extraordinary thing happened. I could see. I could seeeverything. Even with my eyes on “fire” and pressed closed, I could “see” theentire Temple. I saw the incense burning; I saw the Circle; I could even seemyself as if from behind and above; I saw Orobas standing in the Triangle.I was in so much pain that I wasn’t at all impressed with this new “magicalvision.” I had to do something quickly about my eyes. I pointed my wand at theSpirit and barked “stay!” Orobas immediately reclined and remained motionlessand peaceful as if he were the little donkey in a nativity scene.I left the Circle and ran to the bathroom adjacent to the bedroom. I quicklypulled my robe over my head and got into the shower. It was difficult to open myeyes so I held them open with my fingers and allowed the cold water to spraydirectly on them. I don’t know how long I stood there before I felt some reliefbut it seemed forever.As I toweled myself dry and put my robe back on the absurdity of my situationbecame embarrassingly amusing. The picture of me, a grown man, blindly stumblingout of a “Magic Circle” hurling hysterical curses at a demon (that in allprobability was just an idea held in a Triangle by my imagination), suddenlybecame too funny for words.I looked into the bathroom mirror at my bright red blood-shot eyes and wet hairhanging over my ears and started to laugh hysterically. Some magician.I felt better now—relieved—as if I experienced a discharge of energy that hadbeen knotted up inside me all my life. Now I couldn’t wait to finish theoperation.Back in the Circle all the nervousness that I felt earlier was gone. Withcold-blooded resolve I picked up my Wand and addressed Orobas once again. Thistime there was a clear two-way communication. I mentally spoke my words and“heard” Orobas’ response simultaneously:“I called you forth in good faith. Why did you bum my eyes?”“You burned your own eyes. Only an idiot would put cinnamon oil on his foreheadin this heat.”“If you ever do anything like that again I will destroy you.”“Then I apologize for that which I did not do. Why am I here?”“Is everything the book tells me about you true?”“It is...and more.”“Then I tell you, my life is crap. I need to get control of it. I need the‘dignity’ to be able to properly care for my family. I need action now. I chargeyou to muster all the spirits under your control to immediately set to work tocorrect my situation. I want to see some positive sign today that you areworking for me.”“But today is too soon.” Orobas said calmly. “It is unfair to ask me to work sofast. Give me at least two weeks to show you a sign.”“He’s right.” I thought to myself. “I am asking too much. Maybe I should givehim more time. If I don’t see any results today, then I will have to admit thatthis operation is a failure. How will that make me feel? I’m depressed already.I don’t know if I could take one more failure. Failure in life, failure inMagick. Maybe I should give him a month—no—six months—yes—six months—something’s bound to happen in six months—then I’ll be able to say the operationwas a success...”I stopped myself in mid-sentence. These are not my thoughts, they’re his\\ Thisis the classic negotiation process of the Spirits. This is how the magiciancould be talked into pacts and other such silliness. If I allowed him to go onhe could talk me into anything and make me think it was my own idea! It was sosubtle yet so obvious. I had to regain control of the conversation.“No! No more time. I need to see positive proof you are fulfilling your chargeand I need to see it today. If I don’t, I swear by these red eyes that I willrecast the Circle and Triangle for the purpose of burning your seal andannihilating you. On the other hand, if you fulfill your charge I will exalt youand your name. Your seal will live in metal or stone for a thousand years, andyou will be redeemed even as I am redeemed. Is that clear?”“It is clear.”I sent him off with an ad lib license to depart and when I could no longer sensehis presence I banished the Temple and disassembled the Circle and Triangle.The entire procedure took a little over an hour. My wife and son were amusingthemselves in the living room and were completely unaware of the adventure I hadjust experienced on the other side of the door.“What happened to your eyes?” was the only question I was forced to deal withand the entire event almost immediately took on the dimensions of a distantmemory.I got a drink of water and stretched out on the floor to digest what had justhappened when we were all startled by the rumblings of what was obviously an oldcar with a very bad muffler. It coughed and choked to a stop directly in frontof our apartment and the driver got out and pounded loudly on our door.It was “Mad Bob,” one of our oldest and dearest friends. He had been out of thecountry for several years so we were surprised and delighted to see him again.After surviving his lusty bear-hugs we asked him to come in but he said hecouldn’t stay. He reached into his pocket and took out the keys to his jalopyand tossed them on the couch.“The car is yours! I’m going to Guatemala. I need to be in Long Beach in a halfan hour, give me a ride.”If this wasn’t the sign I asked Orobas for it was damned good facsimile. We gotinto my “new” car and drove to Long Beach where I dropped Mad Bob off to beginhis Guatemala adventure. My adventure was just beginning as well.On the way home, I converted the pennies in the ashtray to a quarter and boughta local newspaper. At home I combed the “Help Wanted” columns and circled threeentry-level positions at companies I could now reach in my car. The followingday I applied in person at all three and was hired by the third. Three monthsand three promotions later, I found myself in the engineering department of alarge medical device laboratory making a “dignified” wage. During that sameperiod, because of a chain of extraordinary events, I was consecrated Bishop ofEcclesia Gnostica Catholica. This “Prelacy” was entirely unexpected and hasbecome one of the most important aspects of my adult life.Soon after getting my job, I cast the Circle and Triangle and called Orobasagain. This time to thank him and tell him I recognized his faithful executionof my charge. I engraved his siigil beautifully upon an attractive tin platethat, barring a direct nuclear hit or a supernova of the Sun, will last athousand years.I have called up many of the 72 Spirits over the ensuing years but I havetroubled Orobas only a handful of times since (only in times of absolutedesperation and after I have exhausted all other means of helping myself). Heremains a loyal familiar and has never yet failed in his ability to fulfill hisinstructions.The reader can invoke coincidence and argue that all the events subsequent to myevocation were in the process of happening to me anyway. And to this I will notargue. But as much as my left brain interprets such phenomena subjectively—inthe terms of psychology, my right brain will always be convinced that there isan objective and independent reality to the Spirits.As a matter of fact, some of the most competent and experienced Goetic magicianstoday dismiss the purely psychological explanation as naive. They point outexamples of evocations characterized by objects being moved or thrown across theroom, power surges, or electric or electronic devices activated or deactivated,and even instances of the Spirit (operating on the magician’s instructions)“appearing” before third parties who are unaware of the operation.Regardless of which theory you embrace, the fact remains that individualscontinue to experience perceptible changes in their lives that are identical tothe changes they wish to affect by Goetic evocation.I confess that not every evocation I have performed has been as successful asthe Orobas working. On several occasions the “disobedient Spirit” necessitatedseveral conjurations (complete with threats, curses and sigil torture) beforethe desired result was achieved. Some evocations, I have to admit, have beendismal failures. But even they have yielded much important information. As amatter of fact, I have learned more from the disasters than the triumphs becauseby reviewing my notes of these events I have been able to draw a profile of whatis necessary for success:1. Justification. Is this evocation necessary? Do I deserve the desired objectof the operation? Have I done everything I can on the material plane to achievethis result? Or am I lying to myself about my motives and needs?You must be completely convinced that your demands are absolutely justified.(And don’t think we are invoking the great demon “morality” here. An unnecessarymotive is an unworthy motive—pure and simple) When you are truly justified inyour demands then you have the momentum of the entire universe behind you.2. Emotion. Unless there is an emotional link to the desired result of theoperation, the magician is not tapping that strata of himself (or the spiritualworld) where the Spirits of the Goetia reside. The first time you really see aGoetic Spirit you will feel like you have pulled it out of your gut and thrownit in the TriangleThis is why evocations for the sake of experiment or entertainment seldomachieve satisfactory results and operations of desperation or profound personalneed often do.3. Will. It is not enough to be emotionally charged concerning the object of theoperation if you are not prepared to do anything about it. The ceremony ofevocation must be the unambiguous expression of your absolute Will to effectthis change and your willingness to plumb the depths of Hell to see that it isdone.4. Courage. “Fear is failure and the forerunner of failure.” and Goeticevocations can be very frightening indeed. But if you are justified in yourneed; if it means so much to you that you are charging the ceremony with pure,raw emotion', if all this is truly your Will—then courage will become yourimpregnable Circle.By the same token cowardice will be your undoing. If it is truly your Will toinjure your enemy, why go to the trouble to perform a Goetic Evocation when itwould be much more effective “magick” to simply confront the person and punchthem in the nose. If you think you are going to escape the consequences of thisact by sending a Goetic Spirit to do it for you may be unpleasantly surprised."},{"pageContent":"A WARNINGWe have also observed, it is sad to say, that the efficacy of the Art does notalways manifest in a positive way in every practitioner’s life. Often, eitherbecause of inherent character flaws or preexisting pathologies, the “Spirits”end up running the magician instead of the other way around. It is easy to seethat of all branches of ceremonial magick Goetic evocation is among the mostlikely to be abused, misused and misunderstood.In retrospect I now see why my teacher was so reluctant to encourage me as ayoung student to experiment with the Goetia. In her long career she had seenmore Goetic disasters than successes and had chosen, probably wisely, to avoidthe system altogether.Often immature dabblers, realizing how easy and effective evocation can be,forego all other aspects of magick including the all important quest for theKnowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. They make Goetia thecenterpiece of their magical lives and gather together impressionable,weak-willed individuals to form a “lodge.” Impressed by phenomenon that the“master” can easily produce, these individuals often become more his victimsthan his students. Gone unchecked these relationships eventually become that ofmaster and slave. Unfortunately sincere students often base their entire opinionof ceremonial magick by the pathetic and sophomoric shenanigans of such groups.The Operator-Receiver technique (usually done with a Magick Mirror in theTriangle) is a very effective and historically valid method of evocation. Wefeel, however, that the reader is well advised not to seek preliminary Goeticinstruction from a group or from individuals who offer to “operate” an evocationwhile you “receive” the vision. Although this technique is very effective,unless you have absolute confidence in the motives and mental health of your“operator” you are better off working alone or with a trusted and willingpartner of your choice.The exercises of sexual evocation included later in the book are to be done bytwo individuals who know and trust each other intimately. Individuals who useSex Magick, Goetic evocation or indeed, any “magical” lures as “pick up”techniques are all but shouting to the world they are unable to get a sexpartner any other way. These are the last people on earth from whom anyoneshould want to be taught Magick."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVEHistory> > If the eye could see the demons that people the universe, existence would be> > impossible.— Talmud, Berakot, 6The format of Goetic evocation contains perhaps the most colorful andrecognizable elements of any type of Western ceremonial magick. The magician,robed and armed stands inside the Magick Circle protected from the malice of theSpirits by the innumerable Holy Names scrawled thereupon. Several feet awaystands the Spirit trapped inside the Triangle of the Art. With his Wand upraisedthe magician issues his commands and the Spirit reluctantly obeys. This is thestuff of “Sword and Sorcerer” movies. Yet this is precisely the method, and ithas come down to us in a most extraordinary way.Sixteenth and seventeenth Century Europe abounded with a myriad of practitionersof the magical arts who, for the most part, were inspired by the colorful imagesof Middle-Eastern magic.We must keep in mind that for many years much of Iberian Peninsula was occupiedby the Moslems. Ironically, even though Islamic law dictates strictproscriptions against unorthodox spiritual practices, the occupation forcestolerated a handful of Spanish communities where a certain level of spiritualfreedom flourished.These pockets of liberality attracted not only the innovative practitioners ofthe “Black Arts,” but also the Jewish Qabalists whose wisdom was, for the firsttime, committed to writing. This period was to profoundly influence theRenaissance and subsequently the entire “Hermetic” traditions of WesternCivilization.It is from this tradition that the concept of “Solomonic” magic was developed.Spirits (genies) trapped in bottles, magic carpets, great treasures protected bydemons—all reminiscent of A Thousand and One Arabian Nights.The text that has become known as the Goetia is the first book of what iscommonly referred to as the Lemegeton, a collection of five texts traditionallyattributed to King Solomon. The most popular versions (including the one Crowleyhired S.L. MacGregor Mathers to translate) are drawn primarily from translationsof Sloane Manuscripts nos. 2731 and 3648 in the possession of the BritishLibrary.Few individuals today are so naive as to believe that the author was indeed thelegendary Hebrew King. Indeed, there is no evidence to demonstrate that the fivetexts are even the work of a single author or that the authors were evenpracticing magicians. In fact, by the very nature of the translations it isobvious that the scribe or scribes were decidedly hostile toward the art. Manyof the Spirits are clearly the Gods and Goddesses of older religions who were“banished” to the infernal regions by the new Order. Many of the Dukesespecially seem to have been originally female in character (a most dangerousspiritual idea to lonely monastic scribes prone to fantasies).Magic books attributed to King Solomon circulated throughout Europe since atleast the middle of the Sixteenth Century. Sloane 2731 dates from 1687 and mostlikely is the result of one practitioner’s desire to have his favorite“Solomonic” works bound conveniently into one volume.It also appears that he used the opportunity to update the texts by revising thelanguage and using the vernacular of the day. As archaic as the language appearsto us today, The Lemegeton represents a “new, improved” Seventeenth Centuryversion of far older material. How old we cannot say.8[index_split_020.html#filepos103962]The Magical Revival of the late 1800s resulted in new translations and theLemegeton and the Goetia emerged from near complete obscurity and into the lightof relative obscurity and students and practitioners of the occult have beentantalized by its mysteries ever since.Modern editions of the Goetia remain in print and continue to sell very well(almost every student of magick worth his/her salt owns at least one copy), yetrelatively few individuals actually have participated in a Goetic evocation. Thereasons are many but perhaps the single most compelling excuse is rooted in themistaken belief that in order to succeed in evocation one must conform exactlywith the procedures and conjurations outlined in the text.The seemingly endless pages of tedious, archaic and parochial conjurations,constraints, exorcisms and curses continue to bewilder and discourage 99% ofwould-be Goetic magicians. And that is precisely what they are meant to do!"},{"pageContent":"THEORYThe Universe was very simple from the traditional Goetic magician’s point ofview. Above him was God, the creator of the world and the ultimate source of hisauthority. Below the magician was an “infernal” world, inhabited by demonspirits who were once “Angels of the Lord” but now exiled from heaven aspunishment for their pride and disobedience. Their “fall” established theinterdependent threefold “world” in which we find ourselves; Heaven, Earth, andHell.Like the Titans of Greek Mythology, the Infernal Spirits (not God) areresponsible for the maintenance of the material world including the“earthly-fleshly” nature of Man.As a resident of the Earth, the magician stands between the Divine and theInfernal Worlds. If he is pious before the eyes of his “God” then he has theDivine authority to order and control the lower spirits.To achieve this authoritative state of mind the magicians of old recited lengthylitanies of affirmations and self-aggrandizements, itemizing their high moralsand examples of their religious piety. (“You obeyed Moses, you obeyed Aaron,you’ll obey me too!”)Once he had convinced himself that he had the authority to command the Spirit,the magician next had to achieve the subjective state of mind whereby he couldactually “see” it. This he induced by the use of “magic words” which he recitedmuch like a mantra. In this way, he created a strange and mystic atmosphere inwhich nothing was impossible and anything could happen.Standing in the Circle, protected by the Divine names with which he had alignedhimself, the magician (pumped up by affirmations and“intoxicated” by the magicwords) concentrated upon the Triangle until the Spirit appeared. The universallyholy virtues of all things triune was enough to trap the Spirit in the Trianglelong enough to receive the Charge from the magician. After receiving his ordersthe Spirit was given License to Depart to go forth and do the magician’sbidding.The text of the Goetia is filled with the details of such operations—page afterpage of formal Conjurations, Constraints, Invocations, Curses, Greater Curses,Addresses to the Spirit on his arrival and departure, etc."},{"pageContent":"PRACTICEThere exist today, Goetic magicians (both solitary practitioners and organizedgroups) who operate strictly “by the book.” The Circle, the Triangle and all thediagrams are constructed exactly as illustrated in the Goetia. They recite (ormost often read) the conjurations, constraints and curses exactly as written inthe 1687 text. Ceremonies of some of these magicians are a thrill to behold and,without a doubt, the Art will forever be perpetuated in its classic form becauseof their dedicated labor.It must be pointed out, however, that there is absolutely no necessity (norparticular advantage) to blindly conforming with the Conjuration scripts of theancient texts. The Spirits are no more impressed if you say “thee” and “thine”than they are if you say “you” and “yours.”Aleister Crowley was aware of this and crafted several versions of his ownconjurations. In fact, as we shall see later, in his own copy of the Goetia hesimply hand copied the Second Key of the Enochian system. It is our opinion (andthat of other Crowley scholars) that for personal Goetic conjurations Crowleymost likely in his later years discarded the traditional conjurations and simplyrecited the First and Second Enochian Calls.It is also our opinion that the most effective conjurations are of themagician’s own design. We encourage the reader, once the fundamentals of thesystem are thoroughly grasped, to create your own conjuration which, like yourTemple, equipment, and procedures, is uniquely yours.8 [index_split_018.html#filepos98238] For the convenience of the modern readerwe have also put the translated material in Chapter Eight in modern vernacularand, where obvious, returned certain Spirits to their original gender."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXMinimum RequirementsEven though we believe that the Conjurations and certain other components of theSloane material are anachronistically superfluous to modern Goetic evocation, weare notsuggesting that the basic elements of the system are not sound. On the contrary,the fundamentals of the classic procedure are extremely important. We do feel itis very important to encourage the reader to break free from the superstitiousidea that magick will only work by blind conformity to any dictated procedure(new or old). The understanding of what is truly necessary and what is not iswhat separates the real magician from a character in a role-playing game."},{"pageContent":"THE TEMPLEThe Temple need only be a room large enough to accommodate the Circle andTriangle. A living room, a bedroom or a similar area where privacy can beachieved is sufficient. If there is other furniture in the room care must betaken to clear the room of clutter and any appearance of disorder. (Often a roomis more efficiently banished by a good dusting and vacuuming than by thebanishing ritual itself.)"},{"pageContent":"THE CIRCLEIn a very real sense the Circle is not the chalk or tape on the floor but theaura of the magician himself. It not only defines and circumscribes all that heor she is, it stands as a fortress against all that is “outside.”The Circle is the magician’s universe and the center of the Circle is the pointof supreme balance, the fulcrum from which he moves the worlds. For the purposeof Goetic evocation the Circle is not optional. It is a fundamental requirementin the Temple for it is the safety zone in which the magician can stand withcomplete confidence to command the forces trapped in the Triangle.Upon the floor of your Temple draw, tape, paint, scratch or otherwise create aCircle approximately nine feet in diameter. Approximately six inches inside thecircumference draw another Circle. In the space between the circles place theHoly Names of your choice.It would be presumptuous for us to suggest to the reader what Holy Names aremost appropriate. It is each magician’s quest to determine for him/herself which“Deity or Deities” are harmonious with the magician’s own magical universe. TheCircle itself is a perfect symbol of divinity. A simple unbroken line with nonames at all can be sufficient for individuals whose realization of thisabstraction is profound. I have used on occasion a thin silk cord which, afterthe ceremony (when I felt it advantagous to stay in the Circle for hours ordays), I have wrapped around myself as a belt.The classic Circle was that of a coiled serpent upon whose body was written—inHebrew—the Deity, Angel, and Archangel Names attributed to the first nineSephiroth of the Tree of Life. The space between the circles was bright, deepyellow. The lettering was in black. The classic Circle also enclosed fourHexagrams positioned at the quarters and was surrounded by four Pentagramspositioned at the cross-quarters.Examples of traditional and modern magical Circles can be found in the Appendix."},{"pageContent":"THE TRIANGLELike the Circle, the Triangle is not optional. It is the area in which theSpirit appears and is compelled to obedience. (See the Appendix[index_split_124.html#filepos276160].)In the East (or in the indicated direction of the particular Spirit in question)about two feet from the Circle, draw, tape, paint, scratch or otherwise create aTriangle, each side measuring three feet. The Triangle’s base shall be towardthe Circle. Upon each side of the Triangle place the Three Holy Names of yourchoice.The classic Goetic Triangle was surrounded by three names: ANAPHAXETON (GreatGod of all the Heavenly Host) to the left, PRIMEUMATON (the First and the Last)at the base, and TETRAGRAMMATON (the ineffable God name Y.H.V.H.) to the right.Inside the classic Triangle, at the points, were placed the letters MI-CHA-EL(the Archangel Michael). In the center was a circle. The circle in the center ofthe Triangle was green (the remainder of the inside was white) and the names onthe outside of were written in red.As mentioned earlier, the names around the Circle are entirely the prerogativeof each magician. You might ask yourself what qualities, virtues, or powers youhold sacred in your own magical disciplines: LOVE-WILL-UNION;FAITH-HOPE-CHARITY; SAT-CHIT-ANANDA; or words, numbers or formulae whichrepresent such things, could work nicely if they are meaningful to you. Thealmost infinite metaphysical virtues of a triangle make it a perfect device toconfine and control that which has never been confined and controlled by you.For many magicians a simple Triangle with a circle in the center suffices quitenicely (with or without the surrounding names).Incense may also be placed inside the Triangle but once the Temple is opened andthe Spirit conjured the magician should not leave the Circle or reach into theTriangle."},{"pageContent":"THE SEAL OF THE SPIRITUpon the circle of the Triangle will rest the Seal or Sigil of the Spirit drawnupon parchment. These symbols are derived from the traditional Lemegetonmaterial and theoretically are the living representations of the Spirits. Sometexts dictate that it be made of virgin calf-skin parchment and the drawing donewith the blood of an owl or some other beast. Such heroics we feel were intendedas “fool traps” and are unnecessary for modern workings. But if you would feelbetter about the operation if you used the virgin calfskin, please go ahead.After the ceremony you should take pains to house the Seal in a specialcontainer. You should never be careless with an “activated” Seal or forget whereyou put it. Depending upon the purpose of the evocation you may wish to carrythe Seal upon your person or attach it to an object relating to the operation.I have learned from bitter experience that it is unwise to have two operators ina single operation or to give or loan an activated Seal to another person. It ishard enough to keep your own Will directed toward the one purpose of theoperation. I have found it impossible for two individuals to be so unified intheir magical resolve as to gain joint control over a Goetic Spirit. (This doesnot apply to an operation utilizing an operator and a receiver or to sexualGoetia workings such as are described later in this book.)"},{"pageContent":"THE HEXAGRAM OF SOLOMONThe Golden Dawn defined the Hexagram as “...a powerful symbol representing theoperation of the Seven Planets under the presidency of the Sephiroth...” Thisvery recognizable symbol of Judaism, sometimes called the Shield of David, is amost appropriate emblem of the Divine Macrocosm (The big world of God,represented in ancient times by the Sun surrounded by the six then-knownPlanets, (see Appendix [index_split_124.html#filepos276160]).The Goetic magician wears the Hexagram on the skirt of his or her robe to act asa shield or badge of authority. By displaying the Hexagram to the Spirit themagician proves he or she is part of and representative of the Macrocosmic Orderwith full power to exercise that authority. Upon seeing the Hexagram the Spirits(by tradition) are compelled to take on human form.The classic Hexagram was painted upon calfskin parchment and was covered withlinen.Modern magicians should feel free to make the Hexagram as ornate or as simple asthey see fit but by no means should omit this very important magical device."},{"pageContent":"THE PENTAGRAM OF SOLOMONThe Golden Dawn defined the Pentagram as ..a powerful symbol representing theoperation of the Eternal Spirit and the Four Elements under the Presidency ofthe letters of the Name Yeheshuah...” (see Appendix[index_split_124.html#filepos276160]).In contrast to the Hexagram, the Pentagram is the symbol of the Microcosm (thelittle world of Man) represented by the four elements of Fire, Water, Air andEarth governed by the Fifth element of Spirit.As Hexagram affirms that the magician is in harmony with the Macrocosmic Orderthe Pentagram affirms that he is Master of the Microcosmic Order. By wearingthese two symbols the magician is reminded that he or she is positioned betweenHeaven and Hell, Executor of the Gods and Master of the Demons.The Goetia says that the Pentagram should be engraved upon a medallion of silveror gold and worn around the neck. On the flip side of the medallion should beengraved the Seal of the Spirit being evoked.Many modern magicians prefer to construct the medallion from the Spirit’sappropriate metal (gold for Kings, copper for Dukes, etc.). The Pentagramengraved upon the front side, the Spirit’s Seal on the back."},{"pageContent":"OTHER REQUIREMENTSTHE WANDThe Greater Key of Solomon describes the Wand and many other magical weapons ingreat detail. It is accurate to say that to follow the instructions for theirconstruction to the letter would require many months (if not years) toaccomplish. It is generally agreed that such instructions are red herringsdesigned to discourage the dull and unworthy.The Wand is the weapon of the magician’s will and is the instrument with whichhe conjures. (The Sword, while effective for banishing and intimidation, is notthe weapon for Conjuration.) Usually the Wand is approximately the length of themagician’s arm measured from the finger tips to the elbow. Traditionally it ismade of a straight branch of Almond or Hazel wood and is approximately thediameter of the magician’s little finger."},{"pageContent":"THE MAGIC RING OR DISCThere are Goetic magicians who say the Magic Ring is an unnecessary addition tothe list of magical weapons. And, personally, I have never encountered anySpirit from whom I have needed to protect myself against their “stinkingsulphurous fumes and flaming breath.” Nevertheless I have always had the Ring athand when evoking any of the Spirits for whom the text says the Ring isrequired, (see Appendix [index_split_124.html#filepos276160]).One of the most adept Goetic magicians I have ever met related a remarkable taleof his experience with the Magic Ring.While evoking Astaroth9 [index_split_031.html#filepos120078], he became soenamored by the Spirit’s beauty that he forgot the purpose of the evocation. Hesaid that the Temple was filled with an intoxicating perfume which seem to issuefrom her lovely mouth and that as she spoke to him his only thought was that hehad to somehow make physical love to her.It was only by accident that his eyes fell upon the Magic Ring and he recognizedthe need for him to hold it up before his face—not to protect himself from thestinking breath of a monster but to help himself “snap out of it” before he waslured from the Circle to try to make love to the Spirit in the Triangle.The above experience and that of others indicate that the Magic Ring should beincluded in the Goetic magician’s arsenal of weapons.The original text says it is made of gold or silver (of course) and was brightyellow with black lettering. But we feel that any material, even paper, will beeffective."},{"pageContent":"THE BRASS BOTTLEAccording to tradition Solomon sealed up the Evil Spirits in a “Vessel of Brass”and sealed it with a leaden seal. While the occasion seldom arises for its use,a small brass bottle can be employed if necessary against disobedient Spirits asa threat or a punishment device. The Seal of the Spirit is placed inside thebottle and a lead cap placed upon the top. In cases of extreme disobedience thelead cap can be melted into place. [Once, to threaten a particularly hostileSpirit, I placed his Seal in the bottle; rested the lead cap on the mouth of thebottle; placed the bottle on an unlighted piece of self igniting charcoal;placed the charcoal upon a bed of match heads in the censer; and placed thecenser in the Triangle with pieces of stick incense burning perpetually justinches over this whole assembly. The idea being that if even one burning incensestick were to drop an ash still containing a little coal, it would ignite thematch heads, igniting the charcoal, heating up the brass bottle, eventuallymelting the lead seal into place. I (and my remarkably understanding wife) keptthe incense sticks burning for three days before the task I had charged theSpirit with was finally executed.]"},{"pageContent":"THE ROBEThe classic outfit includes a long linen robe (white), a cap or a mitre and beltmade from a lion’s skin upon which are written all the names which are upon theCircle.Any robe that holds for you magical significance is appropriate for Goeticevocation.

Below is an annotated version of The Preliminary Invocationof the Goetia,10 [index_split_044.html#filepos158094] a version of the BornlessRitual of the Golden Dawn, modified by Aleister Crowley for use as a preliminaryritual for not only Goetic workings but for more exalted operations includingthe invocation of one’s Holy Guardian Angel. (See Crowley’s Liber Samech.)It is easy to see that this ceremony serves as both Temple Opening andDeclaration of Authority. Also the Barbarous Names of Evocation serve to“intoxicate” the mind of the magician and evoke the necessary state ofconsciousness.Done correctly, (after the Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram) we believe it isthe only ceremony necessary prior to calling the particular Spirit. In fact, ithas been our experience that once the Preliminary Invocation of the Goetia hasbeen recited one need only call the Spirit by name to succeed in evoking it intothe Triangle. Repetition of the “Hear me...” rubric is generally enough tocompel the most reluctant Spirits to obedience.The Invocation was modified by Crowley to conform with the Deities and formulasof Thelema and the New Aeon. If you are not a Thelemite and have anotherreligion or spiritual discipline by which you are empowered, this ceremony iseasily modified to accommodate your deities and formula.Begin at the center of the circle in the square of Tiphareth.

One now should know beyond the shadow of adoubt that he or she has the spiritual authority to command the Spirits and thatno Spirit will be able to resist the Conjuration. It is enough at this point topoint your Wand toward the Triangle and say something like:Hear me, O Spirit (Name), and appear before this Circle in a fair human form.Come peaceably and visibly, before me in the Triangle of art.Repeat the Spirit’s name several times until you “see” or sense the Spirit inthe Triangle.It should be noted that a large portion of the original Goetia is dedicated tostronger and stronger Conjurations and Curses intended to be used if the Spiritis reluctant to come. If it still does not appear there are even invocations ofthe King who is the “boss” of your Spirit.The mere existence of these extra Conjurations is enough to create a level ofdoubt in the mind of the magician that his first Conjuration might not be strongenough. If you are worried from the start that your Conjuration will not work,then chances are it won’t.We strongly suggest that you keep your Conjuration short and simple and that yourecite it immediately after the Preliminary Invocation when your strength is atits peak.If it is obvious that the Spirit has not obeyed your Conjuration; if you aresure that there is not something (visible or invisible) in the Triangle you maysimply declare that since the Spirit will not cooperate with you, then you haveno choice but to annihilate it and remove it forever from your universe.“If you are not for me, you are against me and if you do not immediately complywith my wishes I will bum your Seal to ashes and remove you forever from myUniverse.”It has been our experience that this simple threat is enough to make the mostuncooperative Spirit “appear.” Usually at this point the Spirit wants to appear,get it’s orders and get out of there. Memorization of the lengthy Conjurationsof the classical texts are only necessary if the magician’s sense of Art demandsit.Below is a Conjuration adapted by Aleister Crowley and translated by him intothe “Angelic” language of Enochian. Crowley obviously felt that the Enochianlanguage had more universal applications than just those relating to EnochianMagick. As a matter of fact, as we mentioned earlier, there is every reason tobelieve that when Crowley performed Goetic Evocation he simply used the Firstand Second Call of the Enochian System. (See The Enochian World of AleisterCrowley: Enochian Sex Magick, New Falcon Publications, 1991 and following theConjuration below.)We have arranged the Conjuration with the English translation appearing directlybelow each line of Enochian. We have done our best to make the translation clearenough for the reader to customize a conjuration of their own. As you can see,Crowley has occasionally simplified or paraphrased portions of the text. If youwould like to learn more about Enochian Magick, we encourage you to refer to theabove mentioned text which includes an excellent Enochian dictionary."},{"pageContent":"THE FIRST CONJURATION(Enochian and English)OI vinu od zodakame, Ilasa, Gahé N: odI invoke and move thee, O thou, Spirit N: and elanusahé vaoresagi Iaida,being exalted above ye in the power of the Most High,gohusa pujo ilasa, darebesa! do-o-i-apéIsay unto thee, Obey! in the nameBeralanensis, Baldachiensis, Paumachia, odBeralanesis, Baldachiensis, Paumachia, andApologiae Sedes: od micaelzodo aretabasaApologiae Sedes: and of the mighty ones who governgahé, mire Liachidae od qouódi Salamanuspirits, Liachidae and ministers of the Housetelocahé: od Tabaäme Otahila Apologiaeof Death: and by the Chief Prince of the seat of Apologiado em Poamala, ol vinu-ta od zodaméta!in the Ninth Legion, I invoke thee and conjure thee!Od elanusahé vaoresagi Iaida,And being exalted above ye in the power of the Most High,gohusa pujo ilasa, darebesa! do-o-i-apé totza dasI say unto thee, Obey! in the name of him whocameliatza od asâ, kasaremé tofagilo od tolergispake and it was, to whom all creatures and thingsdarebesa.

Most often youwill first sense the presence in the Triangle and then an image may begin toappear in the incense smoke. If you utilize a Black Mirror in the Triangle mostoften you will see at least some distortion of your own image but if you expectto immediately see a solidly projected cartoon or holographic image in theTriangle you are most likely going to be disappointed.We feel it is a mistake to take up too much time and energy trying to forceyourself to see the Spirit. You are here to command a Spirit not to explore avision.When you feel certain that the Spirit is in the Triangle, welcome it graciouslyand thank it for coming.Proceed immediately to issue your instructions. Word your commands in such a wayas to avoid ambiguities that will provide loopholes which the Spirit may use toavoid fulfilling the intention of your instructions. (The classic story of theMonkey’s Paw serves as an excellent example.) Never fail to stipulate that youwant your instructions carried out without harm to you or you loved-ones.Give specific time limitations on when you want your instructions executed. Tellthe Spirit in no uncertain terms that if it disobeys the instructions and doesnot meet the deadline, that you will conjure it again and issue a very strictultimatum. (If this becomes necessary do not fail to do so exactly when you toldit you would. Tell it you are giving it one more opportunity to fulfill it’scharge or you will slowly burn it’s Seal until it is utterly destroyed. Do notbluff. If you say you are going to do something, do it.)IMPORTANT: Stay in control of the situation. Every aspect of the evocation mustbe on the magician’s terms. Even though you may find it fascinating, do notenter into unnecessary conversation with the Spirit. It is quite common for theSpirit to attempt to make a deal with the magician or initiate negotiations onthe Spirit’ s terms. This must be firmly yet courteously resisted at all costs.You may, if you feel magnanimous, tell the Spirit that after it executes yourorders satisfactorily, you will do something nice for it to acknowledge itsloyalty; etching its Seal in precious metal or some such honor. But you shouldtake special care to assure the Spirit that as long as it remains loyal andobedient it will share in your good fortune and spiritual success. You willraise it up even as you are raised up."},{"pageContent":"THE LICENCE TO DEPARTAfter you have given the Spirit its instructions give it permission to go andget to work for you. The classic License to Depart contains words to theeffect...“Depart now and be ready to come whenever I call you up whether it be in theTriangle or not. Go! Go peaceably without causing harm to me or my loved-ones.”After this you free yourself from the feeling you experienced when you firstsensed the Spirit’s presence. The state of mind you aimed for at the beginningof the ceremony must be gone. “Snap out of it!—NOW”Once you have returned to an objective, “waking consciousness,” perform againthe Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram and disassemble the Temple. Remove theSeal from the Triangle and place it in the location you have prepared for it.Then forget the whole thing for as long as you can. The more you can release itfrom you mind the faster the Spirit can go to work for you.10 [index_split_032.html#filepos120892] From a Fragment of a Graeco-EgyptianWork upon Magic, originally translated by C.W. Goodwin, 1852..Crowley wouldlater adapt it as the core text of Liber Samech."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTThe Seventy-Two SpiritsThe list of Spirits which follows is from Crowley's original Goetia—which alsoincludes many other prerequisites for evocation. The timing was especiallyimportant to the ancient practitioners. Even though we do not wish to discourageany practitioner who wishes to make the observation of the days and hours partof his or her working, the experience of many modem magicians has shown that theSpirits are easily evoked at any hour of the day or night and on any day of theyear.In Crowley’s 777 (Weiser, 1986), in columns 155, 157, 159, 161, 163 and 165, heattributed the Seventy-Two Spirits of the Goetia (in pairs, Day/Night) to theDecans of the Zodiac. By doing so, he established a relationship to the smallcards of the Tarot and, of course, to the days of the year.We have included that information along with the traditional attributes of theSpirits in what follows. We caution the reader to remember that thesecorrespondences do not serve to perfectly define each other. For example, theSpirit Bael is attributed to the daylight hours of the first Ten Degrees ofAries, and these degrees are represented in the Tarot by the TWO OF WANDS; butthat does not necessarily mean that in all matters Bael is the TWO OF WANDS orthat the TWO OF WANDS always represents Bael.To illustrate how this information could be useful we offer the followingexample:A magician is troubled by a personal or magical problem, let’s say amisunderstanding with a friend or colleague. He decides to perform a TarotDivination to get insight into how to proceed to correct the situation. Thefinal card in his Tarot spread is the EIGHT OF SWORDS (Interference). This, initself, quite accurately describes the situation but does not give him much of aclue as to what to do. But, he notes that the EIGHT OF SWORDS represents thefirst Ten Degrees of Gemini and that this period is represented (in the daytime)by the seventh Goetic Spirit, AMON, who, among other things, “tells all thingspast and to come and procures feuds and reconciles controversies betweenfriends.” After some thought, he decides to evoke AMON for the purpose of“reconciling the controversy.”It only takes a little imagination to see other applications for thesecorrespondences.The illustrations of the 72 Spirits that appear below are the work ofartist-clairvoyant David P. Wilson who is also a talented and adept GoeticMagician. Over a period of 15 years, he has evoked each of the Spirits at leastonce, and has recorded some of the most remarkable Goetic experiences we haveyet encountered.But it is very important for you to remember that, because no two people havethe same visual-emotional “vocabulary,” the images of the Goetic universe willbe unique to each of us. When you participate in an evocation you most likelywill “see” something entirely different than the images described andillustrated below. Do not think that these sketches are what you must see whenevoking any particular Spirit. They are intended to serve only as springboardsto your imagination."},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION :FROM THE GOETIAThese are the 72 Mighty Kings and Princes which King Solomon Commanded into aVessel of Brass, together with their Legions. Of whom BELIAL, BILETH, ASMODAY,and GAAP, were Chief. And it is to be noted that Solomon did this because oftheir pride, for he never declared other reason why he thus bound them. And whenhe had thus bound them up and sealed the Vessel, he by Divine Power chased themall into a deep Lake or Hole in Babylon. And they of Babylon, wondering to seesuch a thing, they did then go wholly into the Lake, to break the Vessel open,expecting to find great store of Treasure therein. But when they had broken itopen, out flew the Chief Spirits immediately, with their Legions following them;and they were all restored to their former places except BELIAL, who enteredinto a certain Image, and thence gave answers unto those who did offerSacrifices unto him, and worshiped the Image as their God.OBSERVATIONSFirst, thou shalt know and observe the Moon’s age for thy working.

The disciplined use of these Spirits can bring about significantpsychospiritual changes not unlike those achieved by psychotherapy.As interesting and effective as your evocations can be they are more useful ifyou can discover which Spirits operate in your life independent of your will andwhich ones you should evoke in order to enrich and balance your life.For example Spirit number 12 SITRI (attributed to the 3rd Decan of Cancer and tothe 4 of Cups) for the daytime and HAAGENTI number 48 (4 Cups) for the night arethe Spirits which operate for me. My birthday is July the 12th. These twoSpirits govern beauty, lust, wisdom and gold. The night vision is involved withalchemy and wisdom which are two major topics that have always interested me.The day vision is lust and beauty which are also powerful forces in my life.Combining these visions we have the Great Occult secret, the alchemical processof transmuting the body through lust into gold. This is, of course, associatedwith Sex Magick.In addition to the obvious associations between date of birth and the GoetiaSpirits there are many other Goetic forces which manifest themselves in ourlives. By knowing these forces you can evoke them and integrate them within yourpsyche. If for example you are susceptible to wild moods or outbursts or if youoften feel weak try to find the appropriate Spirit and evoke it. Begin a“relationship” or dialogue with the Spirit. Ask it what it is trying tocommunicate to you. Command it to cease affecting you or reward it depending onwhat you are trying to accomplish.Keep in mind that reward and punishment are two of the primary means ofcommunicating with Goetia Spirits. Sometimes, instead of direct punishmentwithholding something the Spirit wants works will. The important thing to keepin mind is that your operation must be under your Will. Capricious behavior willnot benefit you. Plan out your operations carefully."},{"pageContent":"TYPES OF PEOPLE AND TYPES OF SPIRITSA simple understanding of psychological types as laid down by Carl Jung will bevery useful in your workings.While I am not an advocate of his therapy or that of his followers, I am veryrespectful of his genius and the maps of the mind he has given us.The first major type is the extravert. For the extravert energy flows from himto the outside world while in his unconscious mind he is pushing the outsideworld away from him.The second major type is the introvert. He feels overwhelmed by the outsideworld and wishes to push it away from him. On the other hand he is fed by theoutside world and secretly invests his own energy into it which in turn alsooverwhelms him.The introvert is interested in “banishing objects,” that is removing theireffect upon him, while the extravert is particularly interested in evokingobjects or bringing them closer to him. In Goetia evocation the introvert mightpractice a more extraverted form, while the extrovert might try a moreintroverted form of evocation.Goetia evocations can also be related to time. Day time evocations are moreextroverted and less frightening, while night time evocations are moreintroverted and more frightening. Certain Spirits can be more in harmony withextraversion while others more in harmony with introversion.Or it might be time to explore a repressed function by evoking Spirits which areopposite of the conscious attitude. For example, introverts might evokeextraverted Spirits at night while extraverts might evoke introverted Spiritsduring the day.Throughout the life of a person a proper balance can occur when the extravertlearns introversion and the introvert learns extraversion. Frequently thisbalance occurs by making the opposite point of view conscious and in the case ofevocation “visible” in the form of a particular Spirit. In drawing the sigil andevoking the Goetic figures which represent the opposite of your consciousattitude you will begin to know and gain control of the repressed parts of yourpersonality.In addition to the two major types which Jung speaks about there are four otherfunctions—two known as the “rational” functions (thinking and feeling) and twoknown as the “irrational” functions (sensation and intuition).These four functions or types also represent approaches to life. The “opposite”or inferior (less used) function for the thinking type is feeling and viceversa. The “opposite” or inferior function for the sensation type is intuitionand vice versa. Most of us tend to favor our strong “suit” while neglecting ourinferior “suit.” Confronting your weaker function can be very unpleasant, thuspeople have a tendency to project on others the dark side of their weakerfunction. In some cases friendships are based on two individuals each having theopposite of their inferior function as the other’s superior function.This can serve the person by keeping his weaker or less developed component outof consciousness or awareness. It can also lead to many problems. Evocation canbe used to develop the weaker or inferior function.Knowing how to identify the various types will also help the operator choose thecorrect partner in operations where medium-ship is essential. Certain types donot make good mediums for the manifestation of particular Spirits. One reasonfor failure in Goetia workings is that people do not spend enough time examiningthe issues of types and personalities.Now the question arises as why should one develop one’s inferior function? Thisis a sensible question and without falling into the moralistic trappings of Jungor his followers I will simply say because it is a Gold Mine. The dross or theweaker function is rich in symbolic material and energy and provides the personwith qualities and abilities missing in his life. Without having to embellishfurther, developing the inferior function makes you feel better. Notice I didnot say more whole. You can’t know wholeness except possibly by feeling better.Wholeness is an abstraction, feeling better is not.The psychological model of types provides the operator with an excellentopportunity to explore Goetia from a different point of view and with adifferent aim in mind. This is not to say that evocation should be practicedsolely for these purposes.Evocation is a result oriented operation. It is not “High Magick” with sublimealtruistic aims. It is practical and down to earth, designed to “get answers”and cause effects."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TENTRanCing OuT aNd SeXuAL EcStaSy Goetia Evocation and The Orgasm of DeathThe breaking of expectation is one of the best means of going into Trance.

It is important to allow yourself to go as deep as you can. Youshould read the above example a couple of times before actually starting theprocedure. Get a sense of the excitement. Feel free to design and redesign yoursexual trance until it suits your needs.The use of sex and hypnosis in Goetia evocation is unique to this particularbook, that is not to say that others have not attempted these experiments andreported them in other writings. What we are doing here is dealing openly withthe issue and providing a workable framework. Remember our framework is not madeof stone and appropriate alterations can be made with experience.We have found that the combination of sex and hypnosis is ideal in expanding thereception of the Medium providing more profound and interesting data from theSpirit. However, it should be pointed out that this operation should not beundertaken unless both the operator and the medium have agreed openly toundertake it and have spelled out all the details. This working requires specialpreparation and thus both participants should work out the details together wellbefore they start their workings. The medium should know ahead of time that theoperator will sexually exhaust the medium. This is essential for the bestresults. Sometimes there may be some minor discomfort for the medium in thispart of the operation and the medium should allow the discomfort to dissipate atits own accord. The operator should be aware that he is manipulating high energycharges and should be very sensitive to the minor discomforts as indicationsthat a new level of ecstasy is about to occur."},{"pageContent":"SOME THOUGHTS TO KEEP IN MINDThe sexual trance is ideal for working with emotional dislikes or revulsions toparticular Spirits or their Seals. It is also an ideal way of working withrelationship issues as well as dealing with repressed subconscious material.The Medium might look at a skrying mirror (mentioned earlier) to enhance visualimagery. It can be placed on the ceiling or the floor outside of the circle. Besure to put the skrying mirror in a triangle.When the Spirit appears, the operator intensifies sexual activity, but not somuch as to distract from the vision. The operator should have a sense of when toask questions and must take complete charge in directing the session. The personwho is acting as the Medium must feel completely free to let go. The Mediumshould not feel responsible for the outcome of the session.Pains should be taken to be aware of all the Goetia rules before starting thisoperation. The license to depart could coincide with an orgasm.

The idea was simply to providea commentary to the Lesser Key of Solomon - an attempt to bring the classic textout of the dusty shadows of Chrislemew1 superstition. The project turned out tobe a loud and rollicking collaboration of three very opinionated practicingmagicians who loved the art of Solomonic magick and the genius of AleisterCrowley. I don’t think it occurred to any of us at the time, but we each in ownway had something genuinely unique and valuable to add to the existing store ofknowledge concerning this most misunderstood spiritual racticeDavid Wilson and I showed up five days a week at the home of Dr. ChristopherHyatt in Long Beach, and in a little over two months the three of us took thebook from conception to completed manuscript. The doctor and I ensconcedourselves at our separate computers at opposite ends of the room; Wilson sat onthe sofa with his drawing pad. Each morning we assembled at 10:00 and mumbledour way through coffee, broke for a light lunch around noon, and promptly at4:00 PM turned off the computers and chatted while the good doctor mixed us alldouble vodka martinis garnished with huge garlic-stuffed green olives. I have toadmit, life was pretty damned sweet.There was never any doubt who was ‘captain’ of this magical crew. Hyatt’s visionof a popular and easy-to-understand how-to magical manual constantly redirectedDavid and I toward broader and more adventuresome horizons than either of uswould have at the time allowed ourselves to venture. This led to some prettylively martini time debates over whether or not the goetic spirits live anexistence independent of the magician’s consciousness.My view was, and remains, that the entire universe - reality itself, includingthe collection of forces we call gods, angels, spirits, demons, and ourselves,is an aspect and expression of consciousness. The magician, indeed everyconscious monad of existence, is in a sense a holographic shard of the universalconsciousness and contains and reflects the entire spectrum of these hierarchiesof spiritual forces. Just as the part of the soul that the qabalists call theNeshamah (the soul intuition) is not limited by time or space, so ultimatelythere is no outside of ourselves for a god or an angel or a spirit or a demon toexist.“The Neshamah eshplanes everthin!” I would insistently slur over my seconddouble martini. A s much as 1 tried to articulate the fact that my ‘theory’allowed that the spirits were simultaneously ‘out there’ and ‘ in here.’ Wilsonwas not to be convinced. For him they were out there - down there - in hell -and they could be objectively summoned, bargained with and employed like anyother labor force or mercenary army. I ended each evening’s debate with the sameexasperated retort. “I agree David! I believe the same thing! But it’s all inyour head too!”Wilson was uniquely qualified for the job of illustrating the spirits. He was atalented cartoonist, and a passionate magician who delighted in any excuse toconjure a demon into the Triangle. Conjuring spirits was for him more than amagical exercise; it was for all intents and purposes his vocation and hisreligion. In the years to follow he would chronicle in print many of his magicaladventures under the pen name S. Jason Black. His inner eye drew from a richvocabulary of provocative and colorful images that breathed tension, romance,and danger into every one of his encounters with infernal spirits.Hyatt seemed to delight in listening to David and I go back and forth about thenature of the spirits. His observations and comments (always frank - sometimescruelly cynical) seemed cunningly designed to provoke us all into deeper anddeeper dimensions of the issue at hand. He quite literally choreographed theproject to become the bi-product of magical group therapy. I will never be ableto properly express what a privilege it was working with these two brilliantmagicians. It is a shame, indeed a tragedy, that both of my old colleagues arenow gone, and our work (a labor of love-hate) has become a cenotaph. I take somecomfort in the fact that our little book remains in print after nearly twodecades, exceeding, I believe, even Dr. Hyatt’s expectations.I continue to receive letters and emails from magicians from all over the worldwho have read Aleister Crowley’s Illustrated Goetia and who seek advice aboutgoetic evocation. I am, in fact, in the process of finishing up a book that is acollection of such letters and my responses to them. I am excited to be able topresent my thoughts and advice in this kind of format, because I believe morecan be learned about magical theory and technique when discussed in the contextof a magician’s day-to-day challenges than from theoretical pronouncements.

Because I think we know each other well enough I’m going to be verycandid with you and assume you will take what I say in the loving spirit withwhich I offer it.First of all, you have not given me enough information to make even a wildevaluation. “Cuts up her arms?” Are they self inflicted? if so, lots of youngwomen (even those who do not dabble in magick) do that. if they are from anunknown cause, it is probably wisest for the time being to let her doctorsexhaust their efforts before assuming a magical cause.“Emergency room twice for other reasons?” What other reasons? Please John! AsMike Myers’ Dr. Evil might say, “Throw me a bone here!”On second thought...don’t.Look. Sometimes it is easy to mistake pre-existing pathologies and dramaticexpressions of mental illness for “magical potential” and demonic attack. It isa fact that the practice of magick can exacerbate existing pathologies. I’m notsaying that this is absolutely the case here, but I can’t count the number ofcases I’ve encountered over the years where people start dabbling with magickBECAUSE they had mental problems to begin with rather than them developingmental problems because they practiced MAGICK. Until they address the truesource of their problem, trying to cure them through magical means only supportsand amplifies the problem.Your concern for her is admirable, and it may be that you can be in a positionto magically help her. if you are convicted you are destined to magically rideto the rescue of this damsel in distress then there is nothing I can say one wayor the other to dissuade you from attempting to do so.But magick is a big art form and more often than not real magick is done byseemingly un-magicky means such as simple human contact, love, support, humor,and giving of yourself on a warm and human level. I will say this, however: ifyou have doubts as to whether or not you are out of your league in magicallydealing with this situation, then chances are very good that you ARE indeed outof your league, and you can help your friend best by simply being her friend andnot by injecting a mysterious element of magick and superstition into theformula of her recovery.Good luck with this.My best,Lon> > Dear Lon,> > Believe you me when I say that I share your concerns.

Put on your thick skin!I think you are missing the biggest and most fundamental big picture as to whatgoetic spirits are, and what one can and cannot do with this particular magicaltechnique. I feel that I have failed miserably by not communicating this moreclearly in my published works. For that, I guess I must apologize.I don’t know what else to tell you except that I believe you cannot evokeanother person’s Gusion, or indeed, another person’s anything. You can onlyevoke yours. Didn’t I make that clear in Key to Solomon s Key ox AleisterCrowley’s Illustrated Goetia or Tarot of Ceremonial Magick or Angels, Demons &Gods of the New Millennium?Also, one magician’s ‘Gusion’ can be a perfect lovely fellow (that’s because hisor her Gusion is for one reason or another already under control. Anotherperson’s ‘Gusion’ can be completely out of control and running amok. That Gusionwill be a very nasty beastie indeed, and very hard to (perhaps impossible) tobring under control.Here’s some practical advice. Something I would do if I were faced with asimilar situation. (But of course, you are not me, so I can’t blame you forignoring this completely.)First of all, do everything you can to get her mind off of magical things. Areyou a skilled enough magician to do that? Magick talk is just making thingsworse for her. Perhaps explore with her alternative health ideas: nutrition,acupuncture homeopathy, etc. - things that bring in real health professionals.Secondly, do whatever you need to do to become comfortable and justified in yourown mind and heart with your own motives for getting so deeply and so seriouslyenmeshed with someone else’s nightmarish and perhaps deadly karma. You must be100% convinced that her issues are your issues - a vital part of your own karma- that her healing is vital to your own spiritual well being. You must beconvinced that you love her that much to risk your own sanity to save hers. (I’mnot exaggerating John.)Finally, if you can get into that unshakable frame of mind, then, without herknowing what you are doing, get something (an article of clothing that she hasworn would be perfect). Take it home with you and perform a simple banishingritual of the pentagram over it. Sprinkle it with clean water, cense it with themost holy incense you have. Then sit down and have a frank impromptuconversation with whatever it is that is contributing to your friend’s mentalproblems. (No need to call it Gusion.) Tell it to get the hell out of her lifeand stop tormenting her. After your little exorcism chat, banish again and goabout your business. Do this twice a day for at least two weeks.For god’s sake do not tell her what you are doing. Do not even hint to what thatsomething is being done! (Secrecy is one the magician’s most powerful tools.) Ifyou do, your efforts will be opening the door wider for the spirit to take herover completely, and you will be drawn deeper into the nightmare yourself.Well that’s got to be the end of my advice to you on this matter. I have thefeeling, however, that you’ve already made up your mind about what you wouldlike to do, and that I’ve just taken a fucking hour out of my life to advise youabout something you will most probably have to learn yourself by trial and(possibly) error. It may be that you really need to do this. All I really knowis that, personally (after 35 years of my own trials and errors) I wouldn’t gonear this chick with a ten foot pole!My best,Lon1 “Chrislemew” is a word I coined to desgnate the doctrines and dogmas ofChristianity, Islam, and Judaism."},{"pageContent":"New Falcon PublicationsPublisher of Controversial Books and CDsInvites You to Visit Our Website:http://www.newfalcon.com [http://www.newfalcon.com]At the Falcon website you can: * Browse the online catalog of all our great titles including books and CDs by Robert Anton Wilson, Christopher S.
