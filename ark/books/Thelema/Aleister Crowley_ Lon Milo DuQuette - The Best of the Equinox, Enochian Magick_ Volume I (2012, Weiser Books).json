The subject has something for everyone. Historians, scholars,and Hollywood filmmakers bask in the radiant person of its creator, Dr. JohnDee, a towering figure who, along with being one of the most influentialpolitical advisors to (and spy for) Queen Elizabeth I, developed this complexmagical system in 16th century England. Linguists, such as Dr. Donald Laycock(1936 — 1988) are fascinated with the ‘angelic’ tongue, a true language that wasallegedly ‘delivered’ by angels to Dee and his partner Edward Kelly1[part0003.xhtml#intro-aft1] under extraordinary circumstances.But if magick is your cup of tea — nothing compares to the breathtaking eleganceof the Enochian system. My interest in Enochian magick began late in 1979 and Ibegan practicing in earnest in the fall of 1980. It has remained the centerpieceof my magical work ever since. The text I would first use as my instructionmanual was the same collection of documents you will find in the book you arereading at this moment — material that in the late 70s could only be found inthe pages of Aleister Crowley's Equinox, vol. I2 [part0003.xhtml#intro-aft2], or(in my case) the newly published Gems From the Equinox3[part0003.xhtml#intro-aft3]. There was very little else available at the time tosupplement the Equinox material. Israel Regardie had published certain GoldenDawn papers4 [part0003.xhtml#intro-aft4] but frankly, at the time, they did moreto obfuscate the subject for me than offer any helpful insight. As difficult asthe Equinox Enochian material appeared to me, I proceeded to tackle it as if itwere the first and last word on the subject. As my mastery of Enochiana grew, sodid my appreciation of Crowley's profound grasp of his subject and what he choseto include in the Equinox.There is enough information in the documents herein bound for the student graspthe system, build and understand the various tablets and tools, and immediatelybegin a program of practical Enochian vision magick. However, I stronglyencourage the reader who intends to engage in the practice to become acquaintedwith the several fine texts that have been published in the last 20 years,especially those written or edited by magicians who actually practice the artrather than those who simply write about it. I do not hesitate to point thereader to the online works of Mr. Clay Holden, and the writings of GeoffreyJames, Stephen Skinner, David Rankine, David Jones, Robert Turner, FraterW.I.T., and Joseph H. Peterson.There is a singular shortcoming to the Equinox documents dealing with Enochianmagick. There is little discussion of John Dee and Edward Kelly and thecircumstances of the reception of the original material. My years of practicehave convinced me that awareness of where it all came from is very important. Inmy book, Enochian Vision Magick (Weiser Books: York Beach, ME, 2008),5[part0003.xhtml#intro-aft5] I spend a great deal of time integrating the earlyDee and Kelly workings into the theory and practice of modern Enochian magick. Icertainly do not to intend to preface this book by reprinting that rather thickvolume, but rather, I hope with sheepish and mock humility that the reader whohas not already purchased and read Enochian Vision Magick will do so at theearliest possible convenient moment.In the early 1990s I was asked by Herman Slater of Magickal Childe Publishing towrite an Introduction to his beautifully produced facsimile edition of some ofthe diaries of John Dee that were originally gathered and published in 1659 as ATrue & Faithful Relation of what passed for many Yeers between Dr. John Dee andsome Spirits.6 [part0003.xhtml#intro-aft6] What he wanted was simple enough — abrief introduction to John Dee — who he was, what he was trying to do with hismagick, and how the texts survived the centuries to be picked up by the adeptsof the Golden Dawn in the late 1800s and then to Aleister Crowley in the firsthalf of the twentieth century.I did the best I could (at least for a young man at the beginning of his writingcareer). The print run of this expensively-produced edition was very small andunfortunately never saw a reprint or second edition. These many years later whenI was asked to introduce the Enochian material from the Equinox for this Best ofthe Equinox edition I immediately thought, that even though my old Introductionwas originally written to comment on Dee's diaries, it would nevertheless alsoperfectly set the stage for this work. The publisher has agreed and so I haveincluded it below.Enochian magick isn't for everyone, but I hope whatever your involvement may bewith this most complex and elegant magical art form — whether it is aspractitioner, dabbler, or dilettante, that you will be touched by its beauty andtransformed by its magick.Lon Milo DuQuette1 [part0003.xhtml#intro-ft1] Alternate spelling, “Kelley” also appears in theoriginal documents.2 [part0003.xhtml#intro-ft2] The Equinox I (nos. 7 & 8). ed.

Theauditorium of Rhemes College was filled to overflowing with the most learned menof Europe. Passionate young students crowded the eaves and pressed hungry earsto the windows to hear an unprecedented lecture on mathematics.The speaker was an extraordinary young Englishman whose commentaries upon thepropositions of Euclid had stunned and delighted the great minds of theUniversity at Louvain and court of Charles V at Brussels. Not yet thirty yearsold, he was being hailed as the “New Agrippa,” the heir to the greatphilosopher-magicians and the first English “Magus.”His name was John Dee and he was destined to become the ornament of the Age, oneof the most influential figures of Renaissance England — also one of the mostvilified.To adequately profile the life and accomplishments of John Dee would require aseries of tomes the size of the one you are now holding. Yet with very fewexceptions, it has only been recently that biographers have begun to scratch thesurface and explore the incredible details that have been denied to the publicfor over three hundred years.He was mathematician, physician, mechanician, geographer, and chemist. He wastutor to royal families both in England and abroad. His private book collectionat his home in Mortlake was Elizabethan England's great library. He wasengineer, antiquarian, scientist and theologian. No vain dabbler, he was masterof these and a score of other arts and sciences. His inventions andcontributions profoundly affected his world.Why then is he not celebrated with the other luminaries of the Elizabethanperiod? Why has his name fallen through the cracks of the history of WesternCivilization?“Caller of Devils, Arch Conjurer, Necromancer, Invocator of damned Spirits,Sorcerer, Witch, Enchanter, Black Magician” ... these were occupations alsoattributed to John Dee. These accusations dogged him throughout his lifetime anddefined his reputation after his death.I will not even attempt to elaborate on the details of this unbelievablyeventful life. I leave that to two most excellent modern biographies:Elizabethan Magic8 [part0004.xhtml#introto-aft8] by Robert Turner, andespecially Peter French's John Dee, The World of an Elizabethan Magus.9[part0004.xhtml#introto-aft9] But a brief sketch at this point I think is inorder.John Dee was born on July 13, 1527 to Rowland Dee and Johanna Wild. The family(who could trace their ancestry to Roderick the Great, an early Prince of Wales)was not wealthy but could boast what could be called a middle class income. Hisfather, a gentleman server to Henry VIII, was not without connections at court.In 1542 his father sent him to Cambridge where young Dee budgeted his time toenable him to routinely study eighteen hours a day. Four years later Henry VIIIfounded Trinity College and Dee received a fellowship as an under-reader ofGreek.At Trinity he also delighted in the study of engineering and mechanics and hevolunteered to be a member of the stage crew in the production of the play PAXby Aristophanes. Amusingly, this was where his reputation as a black magicianbegan. His unique mechanical innovations were responsible for seeminglymiraculous stage effects. The illusion of the Scabrous flying up to heaven witha man on its back provoked rumors of supernatural assistance — and indeed, theequipment constructed by Dee to accomplish this illusion incorporated advancedtechnology and invention not taught at Cambridge.In 1547 he took his first trip abroad to consult with the learned men of the dayin the Netherlands. A year later he received his Master of Arts from Cambridgeand enrolled in Louvain. His reputation throughout Europe was startling.Scholars of many countries traveled to confer with him and invitations fromkings and emperors were routinely, but politely, refused.Back in England, however, his reputation as a sorcerer was enhanced when, in1555, the administration of Queen Mary had him imprisoned because of a falseaccusation of Lawde vayne practices of calculing and conjuring to enchant theQueen. He soon extricated himself from this fall from grace, and when Elizabethwas crowned in 1558 Dee was a frequent and welcome visitor at court. He was evengiven the honor of casting the horoscope determining the date and hour of thecoronation ceremony — ironic, as his astrological practice was part of hisproblem with Queen Mary.Elizabeth conferred often with Dee on matters of state, international policiesand most importantly England's adventurous explorations at sea. His knowledge ofgeography, history and science was unequaled and many of the remarkableachievements of the Virgin Queen should be credited to his sage council. Shebecame his patron and protector.This royal protection would be needed for as his reputation as aphilosopher-magus grew so did rumors and accusations of black magic. The vulgarelement saw his odd, eccentric genius as proof he was in league with the devil.His study of Hermeticism (a perfectly natural endeavor for a Renaissancescholar) was viewed by many with suspicion and fear. His house and library atMortlake were ransacked by a mob of neighbors in 1583 while he was on thecontinent, and he was slandered in print as “Doctor Dee the great Conjurer” byProtestant extremist John Foxe. Dee succeeded in halting the slander but thedamage was done.Dee obviously felt that the discretion he exhibited at home in England would beunnecessary on the more enlightened continent. For six years between 1583 and1589 he and skryer Edward Kelley practiced various forms of cabalistic andangelic evocation quite openly.Upon his return to England (at Elizabeth's request) he continued to be harassedand accused. Elizabeth was too distracted with court intrigues to offer muchsupport.Dee's last years were unhappy. The plague claimed his third wife, Jane Fromand,who mothered all eight of his children. His own health failing, he was pressuredby the plots of his fellows, to give up his position as Warden of ManchesterCollege. He returned to Mortlake with his daughter Katherine who was to be hisnurse in the last years.In December of 1608 (or 1609) after King James I ignored Dee's attempt to clearhis name by being tried as a conjurer, Dee died peacefully at Mortlake.Meric Casubon did not intend to immortalize Dr. John Dee when he publishedportions of Dee's magician diaries in 1659. Quite the contrary, it is clear thathe wished to diminish Dee's considerable reputation by perpetuating a portraitof a gullible and spiritually naïve academician whose unwholesome obsession withdreams of communicating with angels led to his social and financial ruin.Titillating the reader with warnings that the material, “... might be deemed andtermed A Work of Darkness,” Casaubon set to work to destroy Dee's reputation.The reason he would spend the time and considerable expense to vilify the memoryof a man considered by many of his contemporaries to be the greatestmathematician and philosopher of his Age, can be discovered in the complex anddangerous intrigues surrounding the social/political/religious upheaval of thePuritan Revolution.Throughout the Civil War and Commonwealth Period (1642-1660) Casaubon remained aloyal and vocal support of the Anglican Church. As a recognized and respectedclassical scholar he was stunned when in 1644, by order of the government, hisposition at Canterbury and accompanying salary was suspended.Disenfranchised, he sought to avenge himself upon the Puritan government byattacking one of the fundamental tenants of the faith: namely, the belief thatindividuals, independent of the offices and inspiration of the Church, couldreceive spiritual guidance directly from divine sources.If Casaubon could demonstrate that even the great Dr. Dee was victim of diabolicdeception, perhaps the spiritual cause célèbre of Calvin and Cromwell might alsobe no less a product of Satanic delusion. As he would hang if he publicly statedthe latter, he chose to attempt to prove the former.The government of the Commonwealth was indeed upset over the publication of ATrue & Faithful Relation of What Passed for many Yeers between Dr. John Dee . .. and Some Spirits ... (as Casaubon titled the work). However, so many copieswere initially printed and distributed that all official attempts to suppress itfailed.In the minds of the public, the rumors of Dee's involvement in “Black Magic”were true — confirmed by his own words, in his own diaries. Casaubon hadsucceeded in sacrificing the reputation of Renaissance England's greatestphiloso-pher-magus upon the altar of vulgar expediency.Nevertheless, we owe Meric Casaubon a profound debt of gratitude; for no matterhow unworthy his motives, his work has served as an ark — a time capsule whichhas preserved one of the most remarkable magical records of all time.THE METHOD OF SCIENCE, THE AIM OF RELIGION10 [part0004.xhtml#introto-aft10]To the modern student of magick, A True and Faithful Relation . . . is atreasure without equal. We experience almost voyeuristic self consciousness asthe intimate nature of the record unfolds. We become eaves-droppers on thedetails of the most remarkable magical event ever recorded.To Dee, magick was science. He took excellent notes; recording each experiencewith the precision of modern scientific notation. He did not wish to talk withAngels so he could bewitch his neighbor's cow or seduce the girl next door. Hesincerely desired more information about the laws of nature and the underlyingprinciples of Creation.Like Henry Cornelius Agrippa and Giordano Bruno, Dee was conscious of the factthat he was perhaps the most learned man of his day. Everything that was knownto Man was known to him. He was the world's foremost authority on a score ofsubjects from geography to mechanics. Where does the man who knows more thananother person on earth turn when he still has questions? The answer is God, ormore accurately, God's messengers to humanity, the Angels who throughoutbiblical literature appeared to pious men to teach the knowledge that was hiddenfrom mortals. The Patriarch Enoch was once such person who found favor in thepresence of God — hence Dee used the word “Enochian” to describe his efforts.From 1582 to 1589 Dee and his “skryer,” Edward Kelly, plunged almost daily intothe black obsidian mirror that was their doorway to the “angelic” world. Despitehis somewhat dubious reputation, Kelly was a gifted clairvoyant. It was obviousfrom the earliest sessions that something extraordinary was taking place. Bothmen seemed genuinely surprised by the success of the initial contacts; theawkwardness of these early sessions is touchingly amusing.Questions concerning world politics and matters of State dominated these firstencounters but as the sessions continued it became clear that the angels had anagenda of their own. Dee and Kelly were informed that the angelic world could bemore easily accessed and communications more efficiently facilitated if themagician actually spoke the language of the angels. The communicating angelsthen proceeded, in the most complex and extraordinary manner, to teach them theangelic language. This event is without parallel in magical history. IsraelRegardie in his massive work, The Complete Golden Dawn System of Magic11[part0004.xhtml#introto-aft11] writes:The Enochian Language is not just a haphazard combination and compilation ofdivine and angelic names drawn from the [Enochian] tablets. Apparently, it is atrue language with a grammar and syntax of its own. The invocations are notmerely strings of words and barbarous names, but are sentences which can betranslated in a meaningful way and not merely transliterated.Eighteen invocations, or “Calls,” written in the Angelic language, comprise asystem whereby the magician can access the unseen elemental universe underlyingthe phenomenal world. A nineteenth Call is used to penetrate the spiritual worldknown in the system as the Thirty Aethyrs. These correspond roughly to theascending planes of consciousness of the Qabalistic universe and were exploredby the magician in the same manner as “path workings.It is ironic that Dee and Kelly did not utilize much of the technicalinformation dictated to them. They seemed to be almost entirely absorbed in theprocess of obtaining the data.It would be over three hundred years before the material Dee and Kelly laboredso hard to obtain would be organized into a magical system by Golden Dawngenius, S.L. MacGregor Mathers who recognized the intrinsic value of thesurviving diary material. The records found in A True and Faithful Relation . .. supplied the bulk of this information.The two major branches of modern practical Enochian Magic (Elemental andAethyrical) were grafted by Mathers into the Adeptus Minor curriculum of theGolden Dawn. In 1898, Aleister Crowley joined the Golden Dawn and in 1900attained the Grade of Adeptus Minor. The passion of his exploration of theEnochian system far exceeded the efforts of his predecessors and in 1909, whilewalking across the North African Sahara, he completed his systematicexplorations of the thirty worlds of the Aethyrs and chronicled them in hismasterpiece, The Vision and the Voice. Hermetic scholars have seriously comparedthis document to the visionary works of William Blake and the prophetic writingsof Ezekiel and Saint John the Divine.7 [part0004.xhtml#introto-ft7] From the 1992 Magickal Childe Edition.Introduction copyright 1992 by Lon Milo DuQuette.8 [part0004.xhtml#introto-ft8] Elizabethan Magic: The Art and the Magus.

These,grouped about the Holy Twelvefold Table, similarly obtained, were part of thefurniture of the Holy Table, as shewn in Plate I, opposite.Other appurtenances of this table will be described hereafter.IIOther Pantacles were obtained in a similar manner. Here (Plate n) is theprincipal one, which, carved in wax, was placed upon the top of the table. Onfour others stood the feet of the table.Note first the Holy Sevenfold Table containing seven Names of God which not eventhe Angels are able to pronounce.Image [../Images/image00131.jpeg]Image [../Images/image00132.jpeg]These names are seen written without the heptagram within the heptagon.By reading these obliquely are obtained names of Angels called—(1) Filiae Bonitatis or Filiolae Lucis.EMeEseIanaAkeleAzdobnStimcul(2) Filii Lucis.IIhIlrDmalHeeoaBeigiaStimcul(These are given attributions to the Metals of the Planets in this order: Sol,Luna, Venus, Jupiter, Mars, Mercury, Saturn.)(3) Filiae Filiarum Lucis.SAbAthIzedEkieiMadimiEsemeli(4) Filii Filiorum Lucis.L (El)AwAveLibaIocleHagone(l)IlemeseImage [../Images/image00133.jpeg]AwAveLibaIocleHagone(l)IlemeseSee all these names in the heptagram of the great seal.So also there are Seven Great Angels formed thus: take the corner letter S, thenthe diagonal next to it AB, then the next diagonal ATH, then the fourthdiagonal, where is I with Image [../Images/image00134.jpeg] (which indicatesEL), and we have the name—SABATHIELContinuing the process, we getZEDEKIELMADIMIELSEMELIELNOGAHELCORABIELLEVANAELThese names will be found in the Pentagram and about it.These angels are the angels of the Seven Circles of Heaven.These are but a few of the mysteries of this great sealSIGILLVM DEI AEMETHIIIThe Shew-stone, a crystal which Dee alleged to have been brought to him byangels, was then placed upon this table, and the principal result of theceremonial skrying of Sir Edward Kelly is the obtaining of the followingdiagrams, Plates III-VIII.He symbolized the Fourth-Dimensional Universe in two dimensions as a squaresurrounded by 30 concentric circles (the 30 Aethyrs or Aires) whose radiiincrease in a geometrical proportion.The sides of the square are the four great watch-towers (Plates IV-VII) whichare attributed to the elements. There is also a “black cross” (or “centraltablet” according to the arrangement shewn—compare the black cross bordering thetablets in Plate III with Plate VIII).Plate III gives the general view.(The reversed letters which form the word PARAOAN are written in Enochian forconvenience, as our A and O are not distinguishable reverse from forward.)Plate IV gives the complete attribution of the tablet of Air.The 6th file is called Linea Patris.The 7th file is called Linea Filii.The 7th line is called Linea Spiritus Sancti.This great cross divides the Tablet into four lesser (sub-elemental) Tablets,the left-hand top corner being Air of Air, the right-hand top corner Water ofAir, the left-hand bottom corner Earth of Air, the remaining corner Fire of Air.Each of these lesser Tablets contains a Calvary Cross of ten squares, whichgoverns it.Plates V, VI, and VII are similar for the other elements.This is the way in which the names are drawn from the great Tablets. (Examplestaken from Water Tablet.)1. Linea Spiritus Sancti gives the Three Holy Names of God of 3, 4, and 5letters respectively.MPH ARSL GAIOL2. A whorl around the centre of the Tablet gives the name of the Great ElementalKing, RAAGIOSL (similarly for Air BATAIVAH, for Earth ICZHHCAL, for FireEDLPRNAA).Image [../Images/image00135.jpeg]Image [../Images/image00136.jpeg]Image [../Images/image00137.jpeg]Image [../Images/image00138.jpeg]Image [../Images/image00139.jpeg]Image [../Images/image00140.jpeg]3. The 3 lines of the central cross of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost give thenames of 6 seniors. (Thus the 4 tablets hold 24 “elders,” as stated in theApocalypse.) They are drawn of seven letters, each from the centre to the sidesof the tablet.Image [../Images/image00141.jpeg]These three sets of names rule the whole tablet, and must be invoked beforespecializing in the lesser angles of the sub-elements.4. The Calvary Crosses.The name upon the cross read vertically is the name which calls forth the powersof the lesser angle.NELAPR (water of water)OLGOTA (air of water)MALADI (earth of water)IAAASD (fire of water)The name read horizontally on the cross is that which compels the evoked forceto obedience.OMEBB (water of water)AALCO (air of water)OCAAD (earth of water)ATAPA (fire of water)5. Above the bar of the Calvary Cross remain in each case four squares. Theseare allotted to the Kerubim, who must next be invoked. They are:TDIMDIMTIMTDMTDIbeing metatheses of these four letters. The initial determines the filegoverned; e.g., TDIM governs the file which reads T(o)ILVR. These angels aremost mighty and benevolent. They are ruled by names of God formed by prefixingthe appropriate letter from the “black cross” to their own names.6. Beneath the bar of the Calvary Cross remain 16 squares not yet accounted for.Here, beneath the presidency of the Kerubim, rule four mighty and benevolentangels—INGMLAOCVSSNRVOI7. Triliteral names of demons or elementals are to be formed from these 16squares, uniting the two letters on either side of the upright of the cross witha letter chosen from the Central Tablet or black cross in accordance with ruleswhich will be given in their due place. Thus:GMINOCLAet cetera, form bases for these triliteral names.The following rules explain how the sides of the pyramids of which the squaresare formed are attributed to the Sephiroth, Planets, Elements, and Zodiacalsigns.1. Great Central Cross. This has 36 squares, for the decanates of the Zodiac.On the left side of the Pyramid, Linea Patris has the Cardinal signs, the signof the Element itself at the top, in the order of Tetragrammaton (Fire, Water,Air, Earth) going upwards.Linea Filii has the Common signs in the same order.Linea S.S. has the Kerubic signs, that of the element on the left, in the sameorder, right to left.But the order of the decans in each sign is reverse, and thus the planets whichfill the right-hand side of the Pyramids go in the first two cases downwards,and in the third from left to right.The upper sides of the Pyramids are all attributed to the Element of Spirit, thelower sides to the Element of the Tablet.Each square is also referred to the small card of the Tarot which corresponds tothe Decan (see 777).2. Calvary Crosses.Each has 10 squares.The upper sides of the Pyramids are uniformly given to Spirit, the lower sidesto the Sephiroth, in the order shewn. The left-hand sides are attributed to theelement of the Tablet, the right-hand sides to the sub-element of the lesserangle.3. Kerubic Squares.The upper sides pertain to the element of the Tablet, the lower sides to thesub-element. Right and left-hand sides in this case correspond, according to asomewhat complex rule which it is unnecessary to give here. The attributions tothe Court Cards of the Tarot naturally follow.4. Lesser Squares.The upper side of each pyramid is governed by the Kerub standing on the pileabove it. The lower side is governed by the Kerub also, but in order descendingas they are from right to left above. (See angle of Air of Water; the Kerubs goEarth, Fire, Water, Air [from the square marked D, the fifth from the left inthe top rank of the Tablet], and downward the lower sides of the squares markedO, D, E, Z go Earth, Fire, Water, Air.)The left-hand side refers to the element of the Tablet, the right-hand side tothe sub-element of the lesser angle.5. The Black Cross of Central Tablet.The upper and lower sides are equally attributed to Spirit.The left-hand sides to the element of the file, in this order from left toright: Spirit, Air, Water, Earth, Fire.The right-hand sides to the element of the rank in this order: Air, Water,Earth, Fire.IVFollows Plate IX, the Alphabet in which all this is written. It is the Alphabetof the Angelic Language.

Unto you it is said: Behold theFace of your God, the beginning of Comfort, whose eyes are fhe brightness of theHeavens, which provided you for the Government of the Earth, and her unspeakablevariety, furnishing you with a power of understanding to dispose all thingsaccording to the Providence of Him that sitteth on the Holy Throne, and rose upin the Beginning, saying: The Earth, let her be governed by her parts, and letthere be Division in her, that the glory of her may be always drunken, and vexedin itself. Her course, let it run with the Heavens; and as an handmaid let herserve them. One season, let it confound another, and let there be no creatureupon or within her the same. All her members, let them differ in theirqualities, and let there be no one Creature equal with another. The reasonableCreatures of the Earth, and Men, let them vex and weed out one another; andtheir dwelling-places, let them forget their Names. The work of man and hispomp, let them be defaced. His buildings, let them become Caves for the beastsof the Field! Confound her understanding with darkness! For why? it repenteth methat I have made Man. One while let her be known, and another while a stranger:because she is the bed of an Harlot, and the dwelling-place of him that isfallen.O ye Heavens, arise! The lower heavens beneath you, let them serve you! Governthose that govern! Cast down such as fall. Bring forth with those that increase,and destroy the rotten. No place let it remain in one number. Add and diminishuntil the stars be numbered. Arise! Move! and appear before the Covenant of Hismouth, which He hath sworn unto us in His Justice.

This cubeis surrounded by a sphere. About me are four archangels in black robes, theirwings and armour lined out in white.In the North is a book on whose back and front are A.M.B.Z. in Enochiancharacters.Within it is written:I AM, the surrounding of the four.Lift up your heads, O Houses of Eternity: for my Father goeth forth to judge theWorld. One Light, let it become a thousand, and one sword ten thousand, that noman hide him from my Father's eye in the Day of Judgment of my God. Let the Godshide themselves: let the Angels be troubled and flee away: for the Eye of MyFather is open, and the Book of the Aeons is fallen.Arise! Arise! Arise! Let the Light of the Sight of Time be extinguished: let theDarkness cover all things: for my Father goeth forth to seek a spouse to replaceher who is fallen and defiled.Seal the book with the seals of the Stars Concealed: for the Rivers have rushedtogether and the Name Image [../Images/image00209.jpeg] is broken in a thousandpieces (against the Cubic Stone).Tremble ye, O Pillars of the Universe, for Eternity is in travail of a TerribleChild; she shall bring forth an universe of Darkness, whence shall leap forth aspark that shall put his father to flight.The Obelisks are broken; the stars have rushed together: the Light hath plungedinto the Abyss: the Heavens are mixed with Hell.My Father shall not hear their Noise: His ears are closed: His eyes are coveredwith the clouds of Night.The End! the End! the End! For the Eye of Shiva He hath opened: the Universe isnaked before Him: for the Aeon of Saturn leaneth toward the Bosom of Death.Image [../Images/image00210.jpeg]The Angel of the East hath a book of red written in letters of Blue A.B F.M.A.in Enochian. The Book grows before my eyes and filleth the Whole HeavenWithin: “It is Written, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord Thy God.”I see above the Book a multitude of white-robed Ones from whom droppeth a greatrain of Blood: but above them is a Golden Sun, having an eye, whence a greatLight.I turned me to the South: and read therein:Seal up the Book! Speak not that which thou seest and reveal it unto none: forthe ear is not framed that shall hear it: nor the tongue that can speak it!O Lord God, blessed, blessed, blessed be Thou for ever!Thy Shadow is as great Light.Thy Name is as the Breath of Love across all Worlds.Image [../Images/image00211.jpeg](A vast Svastika is shewn unto me behind the Angel with the Book.)Rend your garments, O ye clouds! Uncover yourselves! for the Love of My Son!Who are they that trouble thee?Who are they that slew thee?O Light! Come thou, who art joined with me to bruise the Dragon's head. We, whoare wedded, and the Earth perceiveth it not!O that Our Bed were seen of Men, that they might rejoice in My Fertility: thatMy Sister might partake of My Great Light.O Light of God, when wilt thou find the heart of man— write not! I would notthat men know the Sorrow of my Heart, Amen!I turned me to the West, and the Archangel bore a flaming Book, on which waswritten AN in Enochian. Within was drawn a fiery scorpion, yet cold withal.Until the Book of the East be opened!Until the hour sound!Until the Voice vibrate!Until it pierce my Depth;Look not on High!Look not Beneath!For thou wilt find a life which is as Death: or a Death which should beinfinite.For Thou art submitted to the Four: Five thou shalt find, but Seven is lone andfar.O Lord God, let Thy Spirit hither unto me!For I am lost in the night of infinite pain: no hope: no God: no resurrection:no end: I fall: I fear.O Saviour of the World, bruise Thou my Head with Thy foot to save the world,that once again I touch Him whom I slew, that in my death I feel the radianceand the heat of the moving of Thy Robes!Let us alone! What have we to do with Thee, Thou Jesus of Nazareth?Go! Go!If I keep silence—Or if I speak each word is anguish without hope.And I heard the Aethyr cry aloud “Return! Return! Return! For the work is ended;and the Book is shut; and let the glory be to God the Blessed for ever in theAeons, Amen.” Thus far is the voice of TEX and no more.THE CRY OF THE 29TH AETHYRWHICH IS CALLED RIIThe sky appears covered with stars of gold; the background is of green. But theimpression is also of darkness.An immense eagle-angel is before me. His wings seem to hide all the Heaven.He cried aloud saying: The Voice of the Lord upon the Waters: the Terror of Godupon Mankind. The voice of the Lord maketh the Skies to tremble: the Stars aretroubled: the Aires fall. The First Voice Speaketh and saith: Cursed, cursed bethe Earth, for her iniquity is great. Oh Lord! Let Thy Mercy be lost in thegreat Deep! Open thine eyes of Flame and Light, O God, upon the wicked! Lightenthine Eyes! The Clamour of Thy Voice, let it smite down the Mountains!Let us not see it! Cover we our eyes, lest we see the End of Man.Close we our ears, lest we hear the cry of Woman.Let none speak of it: let none write it: I, I am troubled, my eyes are moistwith dews of terror: surely the Bitterness of Death is past.And I turned me to the South and lo! a great lion as wounded and perplexed.He cried: I have conquered! Let the Sons of Earth keep silence; for my Name isbecome as That of Death!When will men learn the Mysteries of Creation?How much more those of the Dissolution (and the Pang of Fire)?I turned me to the West and there was a great Bull; White with horns of Whiteand Black and Gold. His mouth was scarlet and his eyes as Sapphire stones. Witha great sword he shore the skies asunder, and amid the silver flashes of thesteel grew lightnings and deep clouds of Indigo.He spake: It is finished! My mother hath unveiled herself!My sister hath violated herself! The life of things hath disclosed its Mystery.The work of the Moon is done! Motion is ended for ever!Clipped are the eagle's wings: but my Shoulders have not lost their strength.I heard a Great Voice from above crying: Thou liest! For the Volatile hathindeed fixed itself; but it hath arisen above thy sight. The World is desert:but the Abodes of the House of my Father are peopled; and His Throne is crustedover with white Brilliant Stars, a lustre of bright gems.In the North is a Man upon a Great Horse, having a Scourge and Balances in hishand (or a long spear glitters at his back or in his hand). He is clothed inblack velvet and his face is stern and terrible.He spake saying: I have judged! It is the end: the gate of the beginning. Lookin the Beneath and thou shalt see a new world!I looked and saw a great abyss and a dark funnel of whirling waters or fixedairs, wherein were cities and monsters and trees and atoms and mountains andlittle flames (being souls) and all the material of an universe.And all are sucked down one by one, as necessity hath ordained. For below is aglittering jewelled globe of gold and azure, set in a World of Stars.And there came a Voice from the Abyss, saying: “Thou seest the Current ofDestiny! Canst thou change one atom in its path? I am Destiny. Dost thou thinkto control me? for who can move my course?”And there falleth a thunderbolt therein: a catastrophe of explosion: and all isshattered. And I saw above me a Vast Arm reach down, dark and terrible, and avoice cried: I AM ETERNITY.And a great mingled cry arose: “No! no! no! All is changed; all is confounded;naught is ordered: the white is stained with blood: the black is kissed of theChrist! Return! Return! It is a new chaos that thou findest here: chaos forthee: for us it is the skeleton of a New Truth!”I said: Tell me this truth: for I have conjured ye by the Mighty Names of God,the which ye cannot but obey.The voice said:Light is consumed as a child in the Womb of its Mother to develop itself anew.But pain and sorrow infinite, and darkness are invoked. For this child riseth upwithin his Mother and doth crucify himself within her bosom. He extendeth hisarms in the arms of his Mother and the Light becometh fivefold.1[part0008.xhtml#vis-aft1]Lux in Luce,Christus in Cruce;Deo DuceSempiterno.And be the glory for ever and ever unto the Most High God, Amen!Then I returned within my body, giving glory unto the Lord of Light and of theDarkness. In Saecula Saeculorum. Amen!(On composing myself to sleep, I was shewn an extremely brilliant Image[../Images/image00212.jpeg] in the Character of the Passing of the River, in anegg of white light. And I take this as the best of Omens. The letter wasextremely vivid and indeed apparently physical. Almost a Dhyana.)November 17, 1900, Die.A NOTEConcerning the thirty Aethyrs:The Visions of the 29th and 30th Aethyrs were given to me in Mexico in August1900, and I am now (23. 11. 9) trying to get the rest. It is to be remarked thatthe last three aethyrs have ten angels attributed to them, and they thereforerepresent the ten Sephiroth. Yet these ten form but one, a Malkuth-pendant tothe next three, and so on, each set being, as it were, absorbed in the higher.The last set consists, therefore, of the first three aethyrs with the remainingtwenty-seven as their Malkuth. And the letters of the first three aethyrs arethe key-sigils of the most exalted interpretation of the Sephiroth.I is therefore Kether;L, Chokmah and Binah;A, Chesed;N, Geburah;R, Tiphereth;Z, Netzach;N, Hod;O, Jesod.The geomantic correspondences of the Enochian alphabet form a sublimecommentary.Note that the total angels of the aethyrs are 91, the numeration of Amen.THE CRY OF THE 28TH AETHYRWHICH IS CALLED BAGThere cometh an Angel into the stone with opalescent shining garments like awheel of fire on every side of him, and in his hand is a long flail of scarletlightning; his face is black, and his eyes white without any pupil or iris. Theface is very terrible indeed to look upon. Now in front of him is a wheel, withmany spokes, and many tyres; it is like a fence in front of him.And he cries: O man, who art thou that wouldst penetrate the Mystery? for it ishidden unto the End of Time.And I answer him: Time is not, save in the darkness of Her womb by whom evilcame.And now the wheel breaks away, and I see him as he is. His garment is blackbeneath the opal veils, but it is lined with white, and he has the shining bellyof a fish, and enormous wings of black and white feathers, and innumerablelittle legs and claws like a centipede, and a long tail like a scorpion. Thebreasts are human, but they are all scored with blood; and he cries: O thou whohast broken down the veil, knowest thou not that who cometh where I am must bescarred by many sorrows?And I answer him: Sorrow is not, save in the darkness of the womb of Her by whomcame evil.I pierce the Mystery of his breast, and therein is a jewel. It is a sapphire asgreat as an ostrich egg, and thereon is graven this sigil:Image [../Images/image00213.jpeg]But there is also much writing on the stone, very minute characters carved. Icannot read them. He points with his flail to the sapphire, which is now outsidehim and bigger than himself; and he cries: Hail! warden of the Gates of Eternitywho knowest not thy right hand from thy left; for in the aeon of my Father is agod with clasped hands wherein he holdeth the universe, crushing it into thedust that ye call stars.Hail unto thee who knowest not thy right eye from the left; for in the aeon ofmy Father there is but one light.Hail unto thee who knowest not thy right nostril from thy left; for in the aeonof my Father there is neither life nor death.Hail unto thee who knowest not thy right ear from thy left; for in the aeon ofmy Father there is neither sound nor silence.Whose hath power to break open this sapphire stone shall find therein fourelephants having tusks of mother-of-pearl, and upon whose backs are castles,those castles which ye call the watch-towers of Universe.Let me dwell in peace within the breast of the Angel that is warden of theaethyr. Let not the shame of my Mother be unveiled. Let not her be put to shamethat lieth among the lilies that are beyond the stars.O man, that must ever be opening, when wilt thou learn to seal up the mysteriesof the creation? to fold thyself over thyself as a rose in the embrace of night?But thou must play the wanton to the sun, and the wind must tear thy petals fromthee, and the bee must rob thee of thy honey, and thou must fall into the duskof things. Amen and Amen.Verily the light is hidden, therefore he who hideth himself is like unto thelight; but thou openest thyself; thou art like unto the darkness that bindeththe belly of the great goddess.2 [part0008.xhtml#vis-aft2]OLAHO VIRUDEN MAHORELA ZODIREDA! ON PIREDA EXENTASER; ARBA PIRE GAH GAHA GAHALGAHALANA VO ABRA NA GAHA VELUCORSAPAX.And the voice of the aeon cried: Return, return, return! the time sickeneth, andthe space gapeth, and the voice of him that is, was and shall be crowned rattlesin the throat of the mighty dragon of eld. Thou canst not pass by me, exceptthou have the mystery of the word of the abyss.Now the angel putteth back the sapphire stone into his breast; and I spake untohim and said, I will fight with thee and overcome thee, except thou expound untome the word of the abyss.Now he makes as if to fight with me. (It is very horrible, all the tentaclesmoving and the flail flashing, and the fierce eyeless face, strained andswollen.) And with the Magic sword I pierce through his armour to his breast. Hefell back, saying: Each of these my scars was thus made, for I am the warden ofthe aethyr. And he would have said more; but I cut him short, saying: expoundthe word of the Abyss. And he said: Discipline is sorrowful and ploughing islaborious and age is weariness.Thou shalt be vexed by dispersion.But now, if the sun arise, fold thou thine arms; then shall God smite thee intoa pillar of salt.Look not so deeply into words and letters; for this Mystery hath been hidden bythe Alchemists. Compose the sevenfold into a fourfold regimen; and when thouhast understood thou mayest make symbols; but by playing child's games withsymbols thou shalt never understand. Thou hast the signs; thou hast the words;but there are many things that are not in my power, who am but the warden of the28th Aethyr.Now my name thou shalt obtain in this wise. Of the three angels of the Aethyr,thou shalt write the names from right to left and from left to right and fromright to left, and these are the holy letters:The first 1, the fifth 2, the sixth 3, the eleventh 4, the seventh 5, thetwelfth 6, the seventeenth 7.Thus hast thou my name who am above these three, but the angels of the 30thAethyr are indeed four, and they have none above them; wherefore dispersion anddisorder.Now cometh from every side at once a voice, terribly great, crying: Close theveil; the great blasphemy hath been uttered; the face of my Mother is scarred bythe nails of the devil. Shut the book, destroy the breaker of the seal!And I answered: Had he not been destroyed he had not come hither, for I am notsave in the darkness in the womb of Her by whom came evil into the world.And this darkness swallows everything up, and the angel is gone from the stone;and there is no light therein, save only the light of the Rose and of the Cross.AUMALE, ALGERIA.November 23, 1909, between 8 and 9 P.M.THE CRY OF THE 27TH AETHYRWHICH IS CALLED ZAAThere is an angel with rainbow wings, and his dress is green with silver, agreen veil over silver armour. Flames of many-coloured fire dart from him in alldirections. It is a woman of some thirty years old, and she has the moon for acrest, and the moon is blazoned on her heart, and her sandals are curved silver,like the moon.And she cries: Lonely am I and cold in the wilderness of the stars. For I am thequeen of all them that dwell in Heaven, and the queen of all them that are pureupon earth, and the queen of all the sorcerers of hell.I am the daughter of Nuit, the lady of the stars. And I am the Bride of themthat are vowed unto loneliness. And I am the mother of the Dog Cerberus. Oneperson am I, and three gods.And thou who hast blasphemed me shalt suffer knowing me. For I am cold as thouart cold, and burn with thy fire. Oh, when shall the war of the Aires and theelements be accomplished?Radiant are these falchions of my brothers, invisibly about me, but the might ofthe aethyrs beneath my feet beareth me down. And they avail not to sever theKamailos. There is one in green armour, with green eyes, whose sword is ofvegetable fire. That shall avail me. My son is he—and how shall I bear him thathave not known man?All this time intolerable rays are shooting forth to beat me back or destroy me;but I am encased in an egg of blue-violet, and my form is the form of a man withthe head of a golden hawk. While I have been observing this, the goddess haskept up a continuous wail, like the baying of a thousand hounds; and now hervoice is deep and guttural and hoarse, and she breathes very rapidly words thatI cannot hear. I can hear some of them now:UNTU LA LA ULULA UMUNA TOFA LAMA LE LI NA AHR IMA TAHARA ELULA ETFOMA UNUNAARPETI ULU ULU ULU MARABAN ULULU MAHATA ULU ULU LAMASTANA.And then her voice rises to a shriek, and there is a cauldron boiling in frontof her; and the flames under the cauldron are like unto zinc flames, and in thecauldron is the Rose, the Rose of 49 petals, seething in it. Over the cauldronshe has arched her rainbow wings; and her face is bent over the cauldron, andshe is blowing opalescent silvery rings on to the Rose; and each ring as ittouches the water bursts into flame, and the Rose takes new colours.And now she lifts her head, and raises her hands to heaven, and cries: O Mother,wilt thou never have compassion on the children of earth? Was it not enough thatthe Rose should be red with the blood of thine heart, and that its petals shouldbe by 7 and by 7 ?She is weeping, weeping. And the tears grow and fill the whole stone with moons.I can see nothing and hear nothing for the tears, though she keeps on praying.“Take of these pearls, treasure them in thine heart. Is not the Kingdom of theAbyss accurst?” She points downward to the cauldron; and now in it there is thehead of a most cruel dragon, black and corrupted. I watch, and watch; andnothing happens.And now the dragon rises out of the cauldron, very long and slim (like JapaneseDragons, but infinitely more terrible) and he blots out the whole sphere of thestone.Then suddenly all is gone, and there is nothing in the stone save brilliantwhite light and flecks like sparks of golden fire; and there is a ringing, as ifbells were being used for anvils. And there is a perfume which I cannotdescribe; it is like nothing that one can describe, but the suggestion is likelignum aloes. And now all these things are there at once in the same place andtime.Now a veil of olive and silver is drawn over the stone, only I hear the voice ofthe angel receding, very sweet and faint and sorrowful, saying: Far off andlonely in the secret stone is the unknown, and interpenetrated is the knowledgewith the will and the understanding. I am alone. I am lost, because I am all andin all; and my veil is woven of the green earth and the web of stars. I love;and I am denied, for I have denied myself. Give me those hands, put them againstmy heart. Is it not cold? Sink, sink, the abyss of time remains. It is notpossible that one should come to ZAA. Give me thy face. Let me kiss it with mycold kisses. Ah! Ah! Ah! Fall back from me. The word, the word of the aeon isMAKHASHANAH. And these words shalt thou say backwards: ARARNAY OBOLO MAHARNATUTULU NOM LAHARA EN NEDIEZO LO SAD FONUSA SOBANA ARANA BINUF LA LA LA ARPAZNAUOHULU when thou wilt call my burden unto appearance, for I who am the Virgingoddess am the pregnant goddess, and I have cast down my burden even unto theborders of the universe. They that blaspheme me are stoned, and my veil isfallen about me even unto the end of time.Now there arises a great raging of thousands and thousands of mighty warriorsflashing through the aethyr so thickly that nothing is to be seen but theirswords, which are like blue-gray plumes. And the noise is confused, thousands ofbattle cries harmonizing to a roar, like the roar of a monstrous river in flood.And all the stone is dull, dull gray. The life is gone from it.There is no more to see.SIDI AISSA, ALGERIA.November 24, 1909, 8-9 P.M.THE CRY OF THE 26TH AETHYRWHICH IS CALLED DESThere is a very bright pentagram: and now the stone is gone, and the wholeheaven is black, and the blackness is the blackness of a mighty angel. Andthough he is black (his face and his wings and his robe and his armour are allblack), yet is he so bright that I cannot look upon him. And he cries: O yespears and vials of poison and sharp swords and whirling thunderbolts that areabout the corners of the earth, girded with wrath and justice, know ye that Hisname is Righteousness in Beauty? Burnt out are your eyes, for that ye have seenme in my majesty. And broken are the drum-heads of your ears, because my name isas two mountains of fornication, the breasts of a strange woman; and my Fatheris not in them.Lo! the pools of fire and torment mingled with sulphur! Many are their colours,and their colour is as molten gold, when all is said. Is not He one, one andalone, in whom the brightness of your countenance is as 1,728 petals of fire?Also he spake the curse, folding his wings across and crying: Is not the son theenemy of his father? And hath not the daughter stolen the warmth of the bed ofher mother? therefore is the great curse irrevocable. Therefore there is neitherwisdom nor understanding nor knowledge in this house, that hangeth upon the edgeof hell. Thou art not 4 but 2, O thou blasphemy spoken against 1!Therefore whoso worshippeth thee is accursed. He shall be brayed in a mortar andthe powder thereof cast to the winds, that the birds of the air may eat thereofand die; and he shall be dissolved in strong acid and the elixir poured into thesea, that the fishes of the sea may breathe thereof and die. And he shall bemingled with dung and spread upon the earth, so that the herbs of the earth mayfeed thereof and die; and he shall be burnt utterly with fire, and the ashesthereof shall calcine the children of flame, that even in hell may be found anoverflowing lamentation.And now on the breast of the Angel is a golden egg between the blackness of thewings, and that egg grows and grows all over the aethyr. And it breaks, andwithin there is a golden eagle.And he cries: Woe! woe! woe! Yea, woe unto the world! For there is no sin, andthere is no salvation. My plumes are like waves of gold upon the sea. My eyesare brighter than the sun. My tongue is swifter than the lightning.Yet am I hemmed in by the armies of night, singing, singing praises unto Himthat is smitten by the thunderbolt of the abyss. Is not the sky clear behind thesun? These clouds that burn thee up, these rays that scorch the brains of menwith blindness; these are heralds before my face of the dissolution and thenight.Ye are all blinded by my glory; and though ye treasure in your heart the sacredword that is the last lever of the key to the little door beyond the abyss, yetye gloss and comment thereupon; for the light itself is but illusion. Truthitself is but illusion. Yea, these be the great illusions beyond life and spaceand time.Let thy lips blister with my words! Are they not meteors in thy brain? Back,back from the face of the accursed one, who am I; back into the night of myfather, into the silence; for all that ye deem right is left, forward isbackward, upward is downward.I am the great god adored of the holy ones. Yet am I the accursed one, child ofthe elements and not their father.O my mother! wilt thou not have pity upon me? Wilt thou not shield me? For I amnaked, I am manifest, I am profane. O my father! wilt not thou withdraw me? I amextended, I am double, I am profane.Woe, woe unto me ! These are they that hear not prayer. It is I that have heardall prayer alway, and there is none to answer me. Woe unto me! Woe unto me!Accursed am I unto the aeons!All this time this brilliant eagle-headed god has been attacked, seemingly, byinvisible people, for he is wounded now and again, here and there; littlestreams of fresh blood come out over the feathers of his breast. And the smokeof the blood is gradually filling the Aethyr with a crimson veil. There is ascroll over the top, saying: Ecclesia abhorret a sanguine; and there is anotherscroll below it in a language of which I do not know the sounds. The meaning is,Not as they have understood.The blood is thicker and darker now, and it is becoming clotted and black, sothat everything is blotted out; because it coagulates, coagulates. And then atthe top there steals a dawn of pure night-blue,—Oh, the stars, the stars in itdeeply set!—and drives the blood down; so that all round the top of the ovalgradually dawns the figure of our Lady Nuit, and beneath her is the flamingwinged disk, and below the altar of Ra-Hoor-Khuit, even as it is upon the Stéléof Revealing. But below is the supine figure of Seb, into whom is concentratedall that clotted blood.And there comes a voice: It is the dawn of the aeon. The aeons of cursing arepassed away. Force and fire, strength and sight, these are for the servants ofthe Star and the Snake.And now I seem to be lying in the desert, exhausted.THE DESERT, NEAR SIDI AISSA.November 25, 1909. 1:10-2 P.M.THE CRY OF THE 25TH AETHYRWHICH IS CALLED VTIThere is nothing in the stone but the pale gold of the Rosy Cross.Now there comes an Angel with bright wings, that is the Angel of the 25th Aire.And all the aire is a dark olive about him, like an alexandrite stone. He bearsa pitcher or amphora. And now there comes another Angel upon a white horse, andyet again another Angel upon a black bull. And now there comes a lion andswallows the two latter angels up. The first angel goes to the lion and closeshis mouth. And behind them are arrayed a great company of Angels with silverspears, like a forest. And the Angel says: Blow, all ye trumpets, for I willloose my hands from the mouth of the lion, and his roaring shall enkindle theworlds.Then the trumpets blow, and the wind rises and whistles terribly. It is a bluewind with silver specks; and it blows through the whole Aethyr. But through itone perceives the lion, which has become as a raging flame.And he roareth in an unknown tongue. But this is the interpretation thereof: Letthe stars be burnt up in the fire of my nostrils! Let all the gods and thearchangels and the angels and the spirits that are on the earth, and above theearth, and below the earth, that are in all the heavens and in all the hells,let them be as motes dancing in the beam of mine eye!I am he that swalloweth up death and victory. I have slain the crowned goat, anddrunk up the great sea. Like the ash of dried leaves the worlds are blown beforeme. Thou hast passed by me, and thou hast not known me. Woe unto thee, that Ihave not devoured thee altogether!On my head is the crown, 419 rays far-darting. And my body is the body of theSnake, and my soul is the soul of the Crowned Child. Though an Angel in whiterobes leadeth me, who shall ride upon me but the Woman of Abominations? Who isthe Beast? Am not I one more than he? In his hand is a sword that is a book. Inhis hand is a spear that is a cup of fornication. Upon his mouth is set thegreat and terrible seal. And he hath the secret of V. His ten horns spring fromfive points, and his eight heads are as the charioteer of the West. Thus doththe fire of the sun temper the spear of Mars, and thus shall he be worshipped,as the warrior lord of the sun. Yet in him is the woman that devoureth with herwater all the fire of God.Alas! my lord, thou art joined with him that knoweth not these things.When shall the day come that men shall flock to this my gate, and fall into myfurious throat, a whirlpool of fire? This is hell unquenchable, and all theyshall be utterly consumed therein. Therefore is that asbestos unconsumable madepure.Each of my teeth is a letter of the reverberating name. My tongue is a pillar offire, and from the glands of my mouth arise four pillars of water. TAOTZEM isthe name by which I am blasphemed. My name thou shalt not know, lest thoupronounce it and pass by.And now the Angel comes forward again and closes his mouth.All this time heavy blows have been raining upon me from invisible angels, sothat I am weighed down as with a burden greater than the world. I am altogethercrushed. Great mill-stones are hurled out of heaven upon me. I am trying tocrawl to the lion, and the ground is covered with sharp knives. I cut myself atevery inch.And the voice comes: Why art thou there who art here? Hast thou not the sign ofthe number, and the seal of the name, and the ring of the eye? Thou wilt not.And I answered and said: I am a creature of earth, and ye would have me swim.And the voice said: Thy fear is known; thine ignorance is known; thy weakness isknown; but thou art nothing in this matter. Shall the grain which is cast intothe earth by the hand of the sower debate within itself, saying, am I oats orbarley? Bond-slave of the curse, we give nothing, we take all. Be thou content.That which thou art, thou art. Be content.And now the lion passeth over through the Aethyr with the crowned beast upon hisback, and the tail of the lion goes on instead of stopping, and on each hair ofthe tail is something or other—sometimes a little house, sometimes a planet, atother times a town. Then there is a great plain with soldiers fighting upon it,and an enormously high mountain carved into a thousand temples, and more housesand fields and trees, and great cities with wonderful buildings in them, statuesand columns and public buildings generally. This goes on and on and on and onand on and on and on—all on the hairs of this lion's tail.And then there is the tuft of his tail, which is like a comet, but the head is anew universe, and each hair streaming away from it is a Milky Way.And then there is a pale stern figure, enormous, enormous, bigger than all thatuniverse is, in silver armour, with a sword and a pair of balances. That is onlyvague. All has gone into stone-gray, blank.There is nothing.AIN EL HAJEL.November 25, 1909. 8:40-9:40 P.M.(There were two voices in all this Cry, one behind the other—or, one was thespeech, and the other the meaning. And the voice that was the speech was simplya roaring, one tremendous noise, like a mixture of thunder and water-falls andwild beasts and bands and artillery. And yet it was articulate, though I cannottell you what a single word was. But the meaning of the voice—the secondvoice—was quite silent, and put the ideas directly into the brain of the Seer,as if by touch. It is not certain whether the mill-stones and the sword-strokesthat rained upon him were not these very sounds and ideas.)THE CRY OF THE 24TH AETHYRWHICH IS CALLED NIAAn angel comes forward into the stone like a warrior clad in chain-armour. Uponhis head are plumes of gray, spread out like the fan of a peacock. About hisfeet a great army of scorpions and dogs, lions, elephants, and many other wildbeasts. He stretches forth his arms to heaven and cries; In the crackling of thelightning, in the rolling of the thunder, in the clashing of the swords and thehurling of the arrows: be thy name exalted!Streams of fire come out of the heavens, a pale brilliant blue, like plumes. Andthey gather themselves and settle upon his lips. His lips are redder than roses,and the blue plumes gather themselves into a blue rose, and from beneath thepetals of the rose come brightly coloured humming-birds, and dew falls from therose—honey-coloured dew. I stand in the shower of it.And a voice proceeds from the rose: Come away! Our chariot is drawn by doves. Ofmother-of-pearl and ivory is our chariot, and the reins thereof are theheart-strings of men. Every moment that we fly shall cover an aeon. And everyplace on which we rest shall be a young universe rejoicing in its strength; themeadows thereof shall be covered with flowers. There shall we rest but a night,and in the morning we shall flee away, comforted.Now, to myself, I have imagined the chariot of which the voice spake, and Ilooked to see who was with me in the chariot. It was an Angel of golden hair andgolden skin, whose eyes were bluer than the sea, whose mouth was redder than thefire, whose breath was ambrosial air. Finer than a spider's web were her robes.And they were of the seven colours.All this I saw; and then the hidden voice went on low and sweet: Come away! Theprice of the journey is little, though its name be death. Thou shalt die to allthat thou fearest and hopest and hatest and lovest and thinkest and art. Yea!thou shalt die, even as thou must die. For all that thou hast, thou hast not;all that thou art, thou art not!NENNI OFEKUFA ANANAEL LAIADA I MAELPEREJI NONUKA AFAFA ADAREPEHETA PEREGI ALADINIISA NIISA LAPE OL ZODIR IDOIAN.And I said: ODO KIKALE QAA. Why art thou hidden from me, whom I hear?And the voice answered and said unto me: Hearing is of the spirit alone. Thouart a partaker of the five-fold mystery. Thou must roll up the ten divine oneslike a scroll, and fashion therefrom a star. Yet must thou blot out the star inthe heart of Hadit.For the blood of my heart is like a warm bath of myrrh and ambergris; bathethyself therein. The blood of my heart is all gathered upon my lips if I kissthee, burns in my fingertips if I caress thee, burns in my womb when thou artcaught up into my bed. Mighty are the stars; mighty is the sun; mighty is themoon; mighty is the voice of the ever-living one, and the echoes of his whisperare the thunders of the dissolution of the worlds. But my silence is mightierthan they. Close up the worlds like unto a weary house; close up the book of therecorder, and let the veil swallow up the shrine, for I am arisen, O my fairone, and there is no more need of all these things.If once I put thee apart from me, it was the joy of play. Is not the ebb andflowing of the tide a music of the sea? Come, let us mount unto Nuit our motherand be lost! Let being be emptied in the infinite abyss! For by me only shaltthou mount; thou hast none other wings than mine.All this while the Rose has been shooting out blue flames, coruscating likesnakes through the whole Aire. And the snakes have taken shapes of sentences.One of them is: Sub umbra alarum tuarum Adonai quies et felicitas. And another:Summum bonum, vera sapientia, magnanima vita, sub noctis nocte sunt. And anotheris: Vera medicina est vinum mortis. And another is: Libertas evangelii per jugumlegis ob gloriam dei intactam ad vacuum nequaquam tendit. And another is: Subaquâ lex terrarum. And another is: Mens edax rerum, cor umbra rerum;intelligentia via summa. And another is: Summa via lucis : per Hephaestum undasregas. And another is: Vir introit tumulum regis, invenit oleum lucis.And all round the whole of these things are the letters TARO; but the light isso dreadful that I cannot read the words. I am going to try again. All theseserpents are collected together very thickly at the edges of the wheel, becausethere are an innumerable number of sentences. One is: tres annos regimenoraculi. And another is: terribilis ardet rex Image [../Images/image00214.jpeg].And another is: Ter amb (amp?) (can't see it) rosam oleo (?). And another is:Tribus annulis regna olisbon. And the marvel is that with those four letters youcan get a complete set of rules for doing everything, both for white magic andblack.And now I see the heart of the rose again. I see the face of him that is theheart of the rose, and in the glory of that face I am ended. My eyes are fixedupon his eyes; my being is sucked up through my eyes into those eyes. And I seethrough those eyes, and lo! the universe, like whirling sparks of gold, blownlike a tempest. I seem to swell out again into him. My consciousness fills thewhole Aethyr. I hear the cry NIA, ringing again and again from within me. Itsounds like infinite music, and behind the sound is the meaning of the Aethyr.Again there are no words.All this time the whirling sparks of gold go on, and they are like blue sky,with a lot of rather thin white clouds in it, outside. And now I see mountainsround, far blue mountains, purple mountains. And in the midst is a little greendell of moss, which is all sparkling with dew that drips from the rose. And I amlying on that moss with my face upwards, drinking, drinking, drinking, drinking,drinking of the dew.I cannot describe to you the joy and the exhaustion of everything that was, andthe energy of everything that is, for it is only a corpse that is lying on themoss. I am the soul of the Aethyr.Now it reverberates like the swords of archangels, clashing upon the armour ofthe damned; and there seem to be the blacksmiths of heaven beating the steel ofthe worlds upon the anvils of hell, to make a roof to the Aethyr.For if the great work were accomplished and all the Aethyrs were caught up intoone, then would the vision fail; then would the voice be still.Now all is gone from the stone.AIN EL HAJEL.November 26, 1909. 2-3:25 P.M.THE CRY OF THE 23RD AETHYRWHICH IS CALLED TORIn the brightness of the stone are three lights, brighter than all, whichrevolve ceaselessly. And now there is a spider's web of silver covering thewhole of the stone. Behind the spider's web is a star of twelve rays; and behindthat again, a black bull, furiously pawing up the ground. The flames from hismouth increase and whirl, and he cries: Behold the mystery of toil, O thou whoart taken in the toils of mystery. For I who trample the earth thereby makewhirlpools in the air; be comforted, therefore, for though I be black, in theroof of my mouth is the sign of the Beetle. Bent are the backs of my brethren,yet shall they gore the lion with their horns. Have I not the wings of theeagle, and the face of the man?And now he is turned into one of those winged Assyrian bull-men.And he sayeth: The spade of the husbandman is the sceptre of the king. All theheavens beneath me, they serve me. They are my fields and my gardens and myorchards and my pastures.Glory be unto thee, who didst set thy feet in the North; whose forehead ispierced with the sharp points of the diamonds in thy crown; whose heart ispierced with the spear of thine own fecundity.Thou art an egg of blackness, and a worm of poison. But thou hast formulated thyfather, and made fertile thy mother.Thou art the basilisk whose gaze turns men to stone, and the cockatrice at thebreast of an harlot that giveth death for milk. Thou art the asp that has stoleninto the cradle of the babe. Glory unto thee, who art twined about the world asthe vine that clingeth to the bare body of a bacchanal.Also, though I be planted so firmly upon the earth, yet is my blood wine and mybreath fire of madness. With these wings, though they be but little, I liftmyself above the crown of the yod, and being without fins I yet swim in theinviolate fountain.I disport myself in the ruins of Eden, even as Leviathan in the false sea, beingwhole as the rose at the crown of the cross. Come ye unto me, my children, andbe glad. At the end of labour is the power of labour. And in my stability isconcentrated eternal change.For the whirlings of the universe are but the course of the blood in my heart.And the unspeakable variety thereof is but my divers hairs, and plumes, and gemsin my tall crown. The change which ye lament is the life of my rejoicing, andthe sorrow that blackeneth your hearts is the myriad deaths by which I amrenewed. And the instability which maketh ye to fear, is the little waverings ofbalance by which I am assured.And now the veil of silver tissue-stuff closes over him, and above that, apurple veil, and above that, a golden veil, so that now the whole stone is likea thick mat of woven gold wires; and there come forth, one from each side of thestone, two women, and grasp each other by both hands, and kiss, and melt intoone another; and melt away.3 [part0008.xhtml#vis-aft3] And now the veils openagain, the gold parts, and the purple parts, and the silver parts, and there isa crowned eagle, also like the Assyrian eagles.And he cries: All my strength and stability are turned to the use of flight. Forthough my wings are of fine gold, yet my heart is the heart of a scorpion.Glory unto thee, who being born in a stable didst make thee mirth of the filththereof, who didst suck in iniquity from the breast of thy mother the harlot;who didst flood with iniquity the bodies of thy concubines.Thou didst lie in the filth of the streets with the dogs; thou wast tumbled andshameless and wanton in a place where four roads meet. There wast thou defiled,and there wast thou slain, and there wast thou left to rot. The charred stakewas thrust through thy bowels, and thy parts were cut off and thrust into thymouth for derision.All my unity is dissolved; I live in the tips of my feathers. That which I thinkto be myself is but infinite number. Glory unto the Rose and the Cross, for theCross is extended unto the uttermost end beyond space and time and being andknowledge and delight! Glory unto the Rose that is the minute point of itscentre! Even as we say; glory unto the Rose that is Nuit the circumference ofall, and glory unto the Cross that is the heart of the Rose!Therefore do I cry aloud, and my scream is the treble as the bellowing of thebull is the bass. Peace in the highest and peace in the lowest and peace in themidst thereof! Peace in the eight quarters, peace in the ten points of thePentagram! Peace in the twelve rays of the seal of Solomon, and peace in thefour and thirty whirlings of the hammer of Thor! Behold! I blaze upon thee. (Theeagle is gone; it is only a flaming Rosy Cross of white brilliance.) I catchthee up into rapture. FALUTLI, FALUTLI!... O it dies, it dies.BOU SAADA.November 28, 1909. 9:30-10:15 A.M.THE CRY OF THE 22ND AETHYRWHICH IS CALLED LINThere comes first into the stone the mysterious table of forty-nine squares. Itis surrounded by an innumerable company of angels; these angels are of allkinds,—some brilliant and flashing as gods, down to elemental creatures. Thelight comes and goes on the tablet; and now it is steady, and I perceive thateach letter of the tablet is composed of forty-nine other letters, in a languagewhich looks like that of Honorius; but when I would read, the letter that I lookat becomes indistinct at once.And now there comes an Angel, to hide the tablet with his mighty wing. ThisAngel has all the colours mingled in his dress; his head is proud and beautiful;his headdress is of silver and red and blue and gold and black, like cascades ofwater, and in his left hand he has a pan-pipe of the seven holy metals, uponwhich he plays. I cannot tell you how wonderful the music is, but it is sowonderful that one only lives in one's ears; one cannot see anything any more.Now he stops playing and moves with his finger in the air. His finger leaves atrail of fire of every colour, so that the whole Aire is become like a web ofmingled lights. But through it all drops dew.(I can't describe these things at all. Dew doesn't represent what I mean in theleast. For instance, these drops of dew are enormous globes, shining like thefull moon, only perfectly transparent, as well as perfectly luminous.)And now he shows the tablet again, and he says: As there are 49 letters in thetablet, so are there 49 kinds of cosmos in every thought of God. And there are49 interpretations of every cosmos, and each interpretation is manifested in 49ways. Thus also are the calls 49, but to each call there are 49 visions. Andeach vision is composed of 49 elements, except in the 10th Aethyr, that isaccursed, and that hath 42.All this while the dewdrops have turned into cascades of gold finer than theeyelashes of a little child. And though the extent of the Aethyr is so enormous,one perceives each hair separately, as well as the whole thing at once. And nowthere is a mighty concourse of angels rushing toward me from every side, andthey melt upon the surface of the egg in which I am standing in the form of thegod Kneph, so that the surface of the egg is all one dazzling blaze of liquidlight.Now I move up against the tablet—I cannot tell you with what rapture. And allthe names of God, that are not known even to the angels, clothe me about.All the seven senses are transmuted into one sense, and that sense is dissolvedin itself.... (Here occurs Samadhi.) ... Let me speak, O God; let me declareit... all. It is useless; my heart faints, my breath stops. There is no linkbetween me and P.... I withdraw myself. I see the table again.(He was behind the table for a very long time.—O.V.)And all the table bums with intolerable light; there has been no such light inany of the Aethyrs until now. And now the table draws me back into itself; I amno more.My arms were out in the form of a cross, and that Cross was extended, blazingwith light into infinity. I myself am the minutest point in it. This is thebirth of form.I am encircled by an immense sphere of many-coloured bands; it seems it is thesphere of the Sephiroth projected in the three dimensions. This is the birth ofdeath.Now in the centre within me is a glowing sun. That is the birth of hell.Now all that is swept away, washed away by the table. It is the virtue of thetable to sweep everything away. It is the letter I in this Aethyr that givesthis vision, and L is its purity, and N is its energy. Now everything isconfused, for I invoked the Mind, that is disruption. Every Adept who beholdsthis vision is corrupted by mind. Yet it is by virtue of mind that he enduresit, and passes on, if so be that he pass on. Yet there is nothing higher thanthis, for it is perfectly balanced in itself. I cannot read a word of the holyTable, for the letters of the Table are all wrong. They are only the shadows ofshadows. And whoso beholdeth this Table with this rapture, is light. The trueword for light hath seven letters. They are the same as ARARITA, transmuted.There is a voice in this Aethyr, but it cannot be spoken. The only way one canrepresent it is as a ceaseless thundering of the word Amen. It is not arepetition of Amen, because there is no time. It is one Amen continuous.Shall mine eye fade before thy glory? I am the eye. That is why the eye isseventy. You can never understand why, except in this vision.And now the table recedes from me. Far, far it goes, streaming with light. Andthere are two black angels bending over me, covering me with their wings,shutting me up into the darkness; and I am lying in the Pastos of our FatherChristian Rosenkreutz, beneath the Table in the Vault of seven sides. And I hearthese words:The voice of the Crowned Child, the Speech of the Babe that is hidden in the eggof blue. (Before me is the flaming Rosy Cross.) I have opened mine eye, and theuniverse is dissolved before me, for force is mine upper eye-lid and matter ismy lower eye-lid. I gaze into the seven spaces, and there is naught.The rest of it comes without words; and then again:I have gone forth to war, and I have slain him that sat upon the sea, crownedwith the winds. I put forth my power and he was broken. I withdrew my power andhe was ground into fine dust.Rejoice with me, O ye Sons of the Morning; stand with me upon the Throne ofLotus; gather yourselves up unto me, and we shall play together in the fields oflight. I have passed into the Kingdom of the West after my Father.Behold! where are now the darkness and the terror and the lamentation? For yeare born into the new Aeon; ye shall not suffer death. Bind up your girdles ofgold! Wreathe yourselves with garlands of my unfading flowers! In the nights wewill dance together, and in the morning we will go forth to war; for, as myFather liveth that was dead, so do I live and shall never die.And now the table comes rushing back. It covers the whole stone, but this timeit pushes me before it, and a terrible voice cries: Begone! Thou hast profanedthe mystery; thou hast eaten of the shew-bread; thou hast spilt the consecratedwine! Begone! For the Voice is accomplished. Begone! For that which was open isshut. And thou shalt not avail to open it, saving by virtue of him whose name isone, whose spirit is one, whose individuum is one, and whose permutation is one;whose light is one, whose life is one, whose love is one. For though thou artjoined to the inmost mystery of the heaven, thou must accomplish the sevenfoldtask of the earth, even as thou sawest the Angels from the greatest unto theleast. And of all this shalt thou take back with thee but a little part, for thesense shall be darkened, and the shrine re-veiled. Yet know this for thyreproof, and for the stirring up of discontent in them whose swords are of lath,that in every word of this vision is concealed the key of many mysteries, evenof being, and of knowledge, and of bliss; of will, of courage, of wisdom, and ofsilence, and of that which, being all these, is greater than all these. Begone!For the night of life is fallen upon thee. And the veil of light hideth thatwhich is.With that, I suddenly see the world as it is, and I am very sorrowful.BOU-SAADA.November 28, 1909. 4-6 P.M.(Note: You do not come back in any way dazed; it is like going from one roominto another. Regained normal consciousness completely and immediately.)THE CRY OF THE 21 ST AETHYRWHICH IS CALLED ASPA mighty wind rolls through all the Aethyr; there is a sense of absoluteemptiness; no colour, no form, no substance. Only now and then there seem, as itwere, the shadows of great angels, swept along. No sound; there is somethingvery remorseless about the wind, passionless, that is very terrible. In a way,it is nerve-shaking. It seems as if something kept on trying to open behind thewind, and just as it is about to open, the effort is exhausted. The wind is notcold or hot; there is no sense of any kind connected with it. One does not evenfeel it, for one is standing in front of it.Now, the thing opens behind, just for a second, and I catch a glimpse of anavenue of pillars, and at the end a throne, supported by sphinxes. All this isblack marble.Now I seem to have gone through the wind, and to be standing before the throne;but he that sitteth thereon is invisible. Yet it is from him that all thisdesolation proceeds.He is trying to make me understand by putting tastes in my mouth, very rapidlyone after the other. Salt, honey, sugar, assafoetida, bitumen, honey again, sometaste that I don't know at all; garlic, something very bitter like nux vomica,another taste, still more bitter; lemon, cloves, rose leaves, honey again; thejuice of some plant, like a dandelion, I think; honey again, salt, a tastesomething like phosphorus, honey, laurel, a very unpleasant taste which I don'tknow, coffee, then a burning taste, then a sour taste that I don't know. Allthese tastes issue from his eyes; he signals them.I can see his eyes now. They are very round, with perfectly black pupils,perfectly white iris, and the cornea pale blue. The sense of desolation is soacute that I keep on trying to get away from the vision.I told him that I could not understand his taste-language, so instead he set upa humming very much like a big electric plant with dynamos going.Now the atmosphere is deep night-blue; and by the power of that atmosphere, thepillars kindle to a dull glowing crimson, and the throne is a dull, ruddy gold.And now, through the humming, come very clear, bell-like notes, and fartherstill a muttering, like that of a gathering storm.And now I hear the meaning of the muttering: I am he who was before thebeginning, and in my desolation I cried aloud, saying, let me behold mycountenance in the concave of the abyss. And I beheld, and lo! in the darknessof the abyss my countenance was black, and empty, and distorted, that was (once)invisible and pure.Then I closed mine eye, that I might not behold it, and for this was it fixed.Now it is written that one glance of mine eye shall destroy it. And mine eye Idare not open, because of the foulness of the vision. Therefore do I gaze withthese two eyes throughout the aeon. Is there not one of all my adepts that shallcome unto me, and cut off mine eye-lids, that I may behold and destroy?Now I take a dagger, and, searching out his third eye, seek to cut off theeye-lids, but they are of adamant. And the edge of the dagger is turned.And tears drop from his eyes, and there is a mournful voice: So it hath beenever: so must it ever be! Though thou hast the strength of five bulls, thoushalt not avail in this.And I said to him: Who shall avail? And he answered me: I know not. But thedagger of penance thou shalt temper seven times, afflicting the seven courses ofthy soul. And thou shalt sharpen its edge seven times by the seven ordeals.(One keeps on looking round to try to find something else because of the terrorof it. But nothing changes at all. Nothing but the empty throne, and the eyes,and the avenue of pillars!)And I said to him: O thou that art the first countenance before time; thou ofwhom it is written that “He, God, is one; He is the eternal one, without equal,son or companion. Nothing shall stand before His face”; all we have heard ofthine infinite glory and holiness, of thy beauty and majesty, and behold! thereis nothing but this abomination of desolation.He speaks; I cannot hear a word; something about The Book of the Law. The answeris written in The Book of the Law, or something of that sort.This is a long speech; all that I can hear is: From me pour down the fires oflife and increase continually upon the earth. From me flow down the rivers ofwater and oil and wine. From me cometh forth the wind that beareth the seed oftrees and flowers and fruits and all herbs upon its bosom. From me cometh forththe earth in her unspeakable variety. Yea! all cometh from me, naught cometh tome. Therefore am I lonely and horrible upon this unprofitable throne. Only thosewho accept nothing from me can bring anything to me.(He goes on speaking again: I cannot hear a word. I may have got about atwentieth of what he said.) And I say to him: It was written that his name isSilence, but thou speakest continually.And he answers: Nay, the muttering that thou hearest is not my voice. It is thevoice of the ape.(When I say that he answers, it means that it is the same voice. The being onthe throne has not uttered a word.) I say: O thou ape that speakest for Himwhose name is Silence, how shall I know that thou speakest truly His thought?And the muttering continues: Nor speaketh He nor thinketh, so that which I sayis true, because I lie in speaking His thoughts.He goes on, nothing stops him; and the muttering comes so fast that I cannothear him at all.Now the muttering has ceased, or is overwhelmed by the bells, and the bells intheir turn are overwhelmed by the whirring, and now the whirring is overwhelmedby the silence. And the blue light is gone, and the throne and the pillars arereturned to blackness, and the eyes of him that sitteth upon the throne are nomore visible.I seek to go up close to the throne, and I am pushed back, because I cannot givethe sign. I have given all the signs I know and am entitled to, and I have triedto give the sign that I know and am not entitled to, but have not the necessaryappurtenance; and even if I had, it would be useless; for there are two moresigns necessary.I find that I was wrong in suggesting that a Master of the Temple had a right toenter the temple of a Magus or an Ipsissimus. On the contrary, the rule thatholds below, holds also above. The higher you go, the greater is the distancefrom one grade to another.I am being slowly pushed backwards down the avenue, out into the wind. And thistime I am caught up by the wind and whirled away down it like a dead leaf.And a great Angel sweeps through the wind, and catches hold of me, and bears meup against it; and he sets me down on the hither side of the wind, and hewhispers in my ear: Go thou forth into the world, O thrice and four timesblessed who hast gazed upon the horror of the loneliness of The First. No manshall look upon his face and live. And thou hast seen his eyes, and understoodhis heart, for the voice of the ape is the pulse of his heart and the labouringof his breast. Go, therefore, and rejoice, for thou art the prophet of the Aeonarising, wherein He is not. Give thou praise unto thy lady Nuit, and unto herlord Hadit, that are for thee and thy bride, and the winners of the ordeal X.And with that we are come to the wall of the Aethyr, and there is a littlenarrow gate, and he pushes me through it, and I am suddenly in the desert.THE DESERT, NEAR BOU-SAADA.4 [part0008.xhtml#vis-aft4]November 29, 1909. 1:30-2:50 P.M.THE CRY OF THE 20TH AETHYRWHICH IS CALLED KHRThe dew that was upon the face of the stone is gone, and it is become like apool of clear golden water. And now the light is come into the Rosy Cross. Yetall that I see is the night, with the stars therein, as they appear through atelescope. And there cometh a peacock into the stone, filling the whole Aire. Itis like the vision called the Universal Peacock, or, rather, like arepresentation of that vision. And now there are countless clouds of whiteangels filling the Aire as the peacock dissolves.Now behind the angels are archangels with trumpets. These cause all things toappear at once, so that there is a tremendous confusion of images. And now Iperceive that all these things are but veils of the wheel, for they all gatherthemselves into a wheel that spins with incredible velocity. It hath manycolours, but all thrilled with white light, so that they are transparent andluminous. This one wheel is forty-nine wheels, set at different angles, so thatthey compose a sphere; each wheel has forty-nine spokes, and has forty-nineconcentric tyres at equal distances from the centre. And wherever the rays fromany two wheels meet, there is a blinding flash of glory. It must be understoodthat though so much detail is visible in the wheel, yet at the same time theimpression is of a single, simple object.It seems that this wheel is being spun by a hand. Though the wheel fills thewhole Aire, yet the hand is much bigger than the wheel. And though this visionis so great and splendid, yet there is no seriousness with it, or solemnity. Itseems that the hand is spinning the wheel merely for pleasure, it would bebetter to say amusement.A voice comes: For he is a jocund and a ruddy god, and his laughter is thevibration of all that exists, and the earthquakes of the soul.One is conscious of the whirring of the wheel thrilling one, like an electricdischarge passing through one.Now I see the figures on the wheel, which have been interpreted as the swordedSphinx, Hermanubis and Typhon. And that is wrong. The rim of the wheel is avivid emerald snake; in the centre of the wheel is a scarlet heart; and,impossible to explain as it is, the scarlet of the heart and the green of thesnake are yet more vivid than the blinding white brilliance of the wheel.The figures on the wheel are darker than the wheel itself; in fact, they arestains upon the purity of the wheel, and for that reason, and because of thewhirling of the wheel, I cannot see them. But at the top seems to be the Lamband Flag, such as one sees on some Christian medals, and one of the lower thingsis a wolf, and the other a raven. The Lamb and Flag symbol is much brighter thanthe other two. It keeps on growing brighter, until now it is brighter than thewheel itself, and occupies more space than it did.It speaks: I am the greatest of the deceivers, for my purity and innocence shallseduce the pure and innocent, who but for me should come to the centre of thewheel. The wolf betrayeth only the greedy and the treacherous; the ravenbetrayeth only the melancholy and the dishonest. But I am he of whom it iswritten: He shall deceive the very elect.For in the beginning the Father of all called forth lying spirits that theymight sift the creatures of the earth in three sieves, according to the threeimpure souls. And he chose the wolf for the lust of the flesh, and the raven forthe lust of the mind; but me did he choose above all to simulate the pureprompting of the soul. Them that are fallen a prey to the wolf and the raven Ihave not scathed; but them that have rejected me, I have given over to the wrathof the raven and the wolf. And the jaws of the one have torn them, and the beakof the other has devoured the corpse. Therefore is my flag white, because I haveleft nothing upon the earth alive. I have feasted myself on the blood of thesaints, but I am not suspected of men to be their enemy, for my fleece is whiteand warm, and my teeth are not the teeth of one that teareth flesh; and mineeyes are mild, and they know me not the chief of the lying spirits that theFather of all sent forth from before his face in the beginning.(His attribution is salt; the wolf mercury, and the raven sulphur.)Now the lamb grows small again, there is again nothing but the wheel, and thehand that whirleth it.And I said: “By the word of power, double in the voice of the Master; by theword that is seven, and one in seven; and by the great and terrible word 210, Ibeseech thee, O my Lord, to grant me the vision of thy glory.” And all the raysof the wheel stream out at me, and I am blasted and blinded with the light. I amcaught up into the wheel. I am one with the wheel. I am greater than the wheel.In the midst of a myriad lightnings I stand, and I behold his face. (I am thrownviolently back on to the earth every second, so that I cannot quiteconcentrate.)All one gets is a liquid flame of pale gold. But its radiant force keeps hurlingme back.And I say: By the word and the will, by the penance and the prayer, let mebehold thy face. (I cannot explain this, there is confusion of personalities.) Iwho speak to you, see what I tell you; but I, who see him, cannot communicate itto me, who speak to you.If one could gaze upon the sun at noon, that might be like the substance of him.But the light is without heat. It is the vision of Ut in the Upanishads. Andfrom this vision have come all the legends of Bacchus and Krishna and Adonis.For the impression is of a youth dancing and making music. But you mustunderstand that he is not doing that, for he is still. Even the hand that turnsthe wheel is not his hand, but only a hand energized by him.And now it is the dance of Shiva. I lie beneath his feet, his saint, his victim.My form is the form of the God Phtah, in my essence, but the form of the god Sebin my form. And this is the reason of existence, that in this dance which isdelight, there must needs be both the god and the adept. Also the earth herselfis a saint; and the sun and the moon dance upon her, torturing her with delight.This vision is not perfect. I am only in the outer court of the vision, becauseI have undertaken it in the service of the Holy One, and must retain sense andspeech. No recorded vision is perfect, of high visions, for the seer must keepeither his physical organs or his memory in working order. And neither iscapable. There is no bridge. One can only be conscious of one thing at a time,and as the consciousness moves nearer to the vision, it loses control of thephysical and mental. Even so, the body and the mind must be very perfect beforeanything can be done, or the energy of the vision may send the body into spasmsand the mind into insanity. This is why the first visions give Ananda, which isa shock. When the adept is attuned to Samadhi, there is but cloudless peace.This vision is particularly difficult to get into, because he is I. Andtherefore the human ego is being constantly excited, so that one comes back sooften. An acentric meditation practice like mahasatipatthana ought to be donebefore invocations of the Holy Guardian Angel, so that the ego may be very readyto yield itself utterly to the Beloved.And now the breeze is blowing about us, like the sighs of love unsatisfied—orsatisfied. His lips move. I cannot say the words at first.And afterwards: “Shalt thou not bring the children of men to the sight of myglory? ‘Only thy silence and thy speech that worship me avail. For as I am thelast, so am I the next, and as the next shalt thou reveal me to the multitude.’Fear not for aught; turn not aside for aught, eremite of Nuit, apostle of Hadit,warrior of Ra Hoor Khu! The leaven taketh, and the bread shall be sweet; theferment worketh, and the wine shall be sweet. My sacraments are vigorous foodand divine madness. Come unto me, O ye children of men; come unto me, in whom Iam, in whom ye are, were ye only alive with the life that abideth in Light.”All this time I have been fading away. I sink. The veil of night comes down adull blue-gray with one pentagram in the midst of it, watery and dull. And I amto abide there for a while before I come back to the earth. (But shut me thewindow up, hide me from the sun. Oh, shut the window!5[part0008.xhtml#vis-aft5])Now, the pentagram is faded; black crosses fill the Aethyr gradually growing andinterlacing, until there is a network.Image [../Images/image00215.jpeg]It is all dark now. I am lying exhausted, with the sharp edge of the shew-stonecutting into my forehead.BOU-SAADA.November 30, 1909. 9:15-10:50 A.M.THE CRY OF THE 19TH AETHYRWHICH IS CALLED POPAt first there is a black web over the face of the stone. A ray of light piercesit from behind and above. Then cometh a black cross, reaching across the wholestone; then a golden cross, not so large. And there is a writing in an arch thatspans the cross, in an alphabet in which the letters are all formed of littledaggers, cross-hilted, differently arranged. And the writing is: Worship in thebody the things of the body; worship in the mind the things of the mind; worshipin the spirit the things of the spirit.(This holy alphabet must be written by sinners, that is, by those who areimpure.)“Impure” means those whose every thought is followed by another thought, or whoconfuse the higher with the lower, the substance with the shadow. Every Aethyris truth, though it be but a shadow, for the shadow of a man is not the shadowof an ape.(Note: All this has come to me without voice, without vision, without thought.)(The shew-stone is pressed upon my forehead and causes intense pain; as I go onfrom Aethyr to Aethyr, it seems more difficult to open the Aethyr.)The golden cross has become a little narrow door, and an old man like the Hermitof the Taro has opened it and come out. I ask him for admission; and he shakeshis head kindly, and says: It is not given to flesh and blood to unveil themysteries of the Aethyr, for therein are the chariots of fire, and the tumult ofthe horsemen; whoso entereth here may never look on life again with equal eyes.I insist.The little gate is guarded by a great green dragon. And now the whole wall issuddenly fallen away; there is a blaze of the chariots and the horsemen; afurious battle is raging. One hears nothing but the clash of steel and theneighing of the chargers and the shrieks of the wounded. A thousand fall atevery encounter and are trampled under foot. Yet the Aethyr is always full;there are infinite reserves.No; that is all wrong, for this is not a battle between two forces, but a mêleéin which each warrior fights for himself against all the others. I cannot seeone who has even one ally. And the least fortunate, who fall soonest, are thosein the chariots. For as soon as they are engaged in fighting, their owncharioteers stab them in the back.And in the midst of the battlefield there is a great tree, like a chinar-tree.Yet it bears fruits. And now all the warriors are dead, and they are the ripefruits that are fallen — the ground is covered with them.There is a laugh in my right ear: “This is the tree of life.”And now there is a mighty god, Sebek, with the head of a crocodile. His head isgray, like river mud, and his jaws fill the whole Aire. And he crunches up thewhole tree and the ground and everything.Now then at last cometh forth the Angel of the Aethyr, who is like the Angel ofthe fourteenth key of Rota, with beautiful blue wings, blue robes, the sun inher girdle like a brooch, and the two crescents of the moon shapen into sandalsfor her feet. Her hair is of flowing gold, each sparkle as a star. In her handsare the torch of Penelope and the cup of Circe.She comes and kisses me on the mouth, and says: Blessed art thou who hast beheldSebek my Lord in his glory. Many are the champions of life, but all are unhorsedby the lance of death. Many are the children of the light, but their eyes shallall be put out by the Mother Darkness. Many are the servants of love, but love(that is not quenched by aught but love) shall be put out, as the child takeththe wick of a taper between his thumb and finger, by the god that sitteth alone.And on her mouth, like a chrysanthemum of radiant light, is a kiss, and on it isthe monogram I.H.S. The letters I.H.S. mean In Homini Salus and Instar HominisSummus, and Imago Hominis deuS. And there are many, many other meanings, butthey all imply this one thing; that nothing is of any importance but man; thereis no hope or help but in man.And she says: Sweet are my kisses, O wayfarer that wanderest from star to star.Sweet are my kisses, O householder that weariest within four walls. Thou artpent within thy brain, and my shaft pierceth it, and thou art free. Thineimagination eateth up the universe as the dragon that eateth up the moon. And inmy shaft is it concentrated and bound up. See how all around thee gather mywarriors, strong knights in goodly armour ready for war. Look upon my crown; itis above the stars. Behold the glow and the blush thereof! Upon thy cheek is thebreeze that stirs those plumes of truth. For though I am the Angel of thefourteenth key, I am also the Angel of the eighth key. And from the love ofthese two have I come, who am the warden of Popé and the servant of them thatdwell therein. Though all crowns fall, mine shall not fall; for my plumes reachup unto the Knees of Him that sitteth upon the holy throne, and liveth andreigneth for ever and ever as the balance of righteousness and truth. I am theAngel of the moon. I am the veiled one that sitteth between the pillars veiledwith a shining veil, and on my lap is the open Book of the mysteries of theineffable light. I am the aspiration unto the higher; I am the love of theunknown. I am the blind ache within the heart of man. I am the minister of thesacrament of pain. I swing the censer of worship, and I sprinkle the waters ofpurification. I am the daughter of the house of the invisible. I am thePriestess of the Silver Star.And she catches me up to her as a mother catches her babe, and holds me up inher left arm, and sets my lips to her breast. And upon her breast is written:Rosa Mundi est Lilium Coeli.And I look down upon the open Book of the mysteries, and it is open at the pageon which is the Holy Table with the twelve squares in the midst. It radiates ablaze of light, too dazzling to make out the characters, and a voice says: Nonhaec piscis omnium.(To interpret that, we must think of Image [../Images/image00216.jpeg], whichdoes not conceal Iesous Christos Theon Uios Soter as traditionally asserted, butis a mystery of the letter Nun and the letter Qoph, as may be seen by adding itup.)(Image [../Images/image00217.jpeg] is only connected with Christianity becauseit was a hieroglyph of syphilis, which the Romans supposed to have been broughtfrom Syria; and it seems to have been confounded with leprosy, which also theythought was caused by fish-eating.)(One important meaning of Image [../Images/image00218.jpeg]: it is formed of theinitials of five Egyptian deities and also of five Greek deities; in both casesa magic formula of tremendous power is concealed.)As to the Holy Table itself, I cannot see it for the blaze of light; but I amgiven to understand that it appears in another Aethyr, of which it formspractically the whole content. And I am bidden to study the Holy Table veryintently so as to be able to concentrate on it when it appears.I have grown greater, so that I am as great as the Angel. And we are standing,as if crucified, face to face, our hands and lips and breasts and knees and feettogether, and her eyes pierce into my eyes like whirling shafts of steel, sothat I fall backwards headlong through the Aethyr — and there is a sudden andtremendous shout, absolutely stunning, cold and brutal: Osiris was a black god!6[part0008.xhtml#vis-aft6] And the Aethyr claps its hands, greater than the pealof a thousand mighty thunders.I am back.BOU-SAADA.November 30, 1909. 10-11:45THE CRY OF THE 18TH AETHYRWHICH IS CALLED ZENA voice comes before any vision: Accursed are they who enter herein if they havenails, for they shall be pierced therewith; or if they have thorns, for theyshall be crowned withal; or if they have whips, for with whips they shall bescourged; or if they bear wine, for their wine shall be turned to bitterness; orif they have a spear, for with a spear shall they be pierced unto the heart. Andthe nails are desires, of which there are three; the desire of light, the desireof life, the desire of love.(And the thorns are thoughts, and the whips are regrets, and the wine is ease,or perhaps unsteadiness, especially in ecstasy, and the spear is attachment.)And now there dawns the scene of the Crucifixion; but the Crucified One is anenormous bat, and for the two thieves are two little children. It is night, andthe night is full of hideous things and howlings.And an angel cometh forth, and saith: Be wary, for if thou change so much as thestyle of a letter, the holy word is blasphemed. But enter into the mountain ofthe Caverns, for that this (how much more then that Calvary which mocks it, ashis ape mocks Thoth?) is but the empty shell of the mystery of ZEN. Verily, Isay unto thee, many are the adepts that have looked upon the back parts of myfather, and cried, “our eyes fail before the glory of thy countenance.”And with that he gives the sign of the rending of the veil, and tears down thevision. And behold! whirling columns of fiery light, seventy-two. Upon them issupported a mountain of pure crystal. The mountain is a cone, the angle of theapex being sixty degrees. And within the crystal is a pyramid of ruby, like untothe great pyramid of Gizeh.I am entered in by the little door thereof, and I am come into the chamber ofthe king, which is fashioned like unto the vault of the adepts, or rather it isfitting to say that the vault of the adepts is a vile imitation of it. For thereare four sides to the chamber, which with the roof and the floor and the chamberitself makes seven. So also is the pastos seven, for that which is within islike unto that which is without. And there is no furniture, and there are nosymbols.Light streams from every side upon the pastos. This light is that blue of Horuswhich we know, but being refined it is brilliance. For the light of Horus onlyappears blue because of the imperfection of our eyes. But though the light poursfrom the pastos, yet the pastos remains perfectly dark, so that it is invisible.It hath no form: only, at a certain point in the chamber, the light is beatenback.I lie prostrate upon the ground before this mystery. Its splendour is impossibleto describe. I can only say that its splendour is so great that my heart stopswith the terror and the wonder and the rapture of it. I am almost mad. A millioninsane images chase each other through my brain.... A voice comes: (it is my ownvoice — I did not know it) “When thou shalt know me, O thou empty God, my littleflame shall utterly expire in thy great N.O.X.” There is no answer. . . . (20minutes.—O. V.)And now, after so long a while, the Angel7 [part0008.xhtml#vis-aft7] lifts me,and takes me from the room, and sets me in a little chamber where is anotherAngel like a fair youth in shining garments, who makes me partake of thesacraments; bread, that is labour; and fire, that is wit; and a rose, that issin; and wine, that is death. And all about us is a great company of angels inmany-coloured robes, rose and spring-green, and sky-blue, and pale gold, andsilver, and lilac, solemnly chanting without words. It is music wonderful beyondall that can be thought.And now we go out of the chamber; on the right is a pylon, and the right figureis Isis, and the left figure Nephthys, and they are folding their wings over,and supporting Ra.I wanted to go back to the King's Chamber. The Angel pushed me away, saying:“Thou shalt see these visions from afar off, but thou shalt not partake of themsave in the manner prescribed. For if thou change so much as the style of aletter, the holy word is blasphemed.”And this is the manner prescribed:Let there be a room furnished as for the ritual of passing through the Tuat. Andlet the aspirant be clad in the robes of, and let him bear the insignia of, hisgrade. And at the least he shall be a neophyte.Three days and three nights shall he have been in the tomb, vigilant andfasting, for he shall sleep no longer than three hours at any one time, and heshall drink pure water, and eat little sweet cakes consecrated unto the moon,and fruits, and the eggs of the duck, or of the goose, or of the plover. And heshall be shut in, so that no man may break in upon his meditation. But in thelast twelve hours he shall neither eat nor sleep.Then shall he break his fast, eating rich food, and drinking sweet wines, andwines that foam; and he shall banish the elements and the planets and the signsand the sephiroth; and then shall he take the holy table that he hath made forhis altar, and he shall take the call of the Aethyr of which he will partake,which he hath written in the angelic character, or in the character of the holyalphabet that is revealed in Popé, upon a fair sheet of virgin vellum; andtherewith shall he conjure the Aethyr, chanting the call. And in the lamp thatis hung above the altar shall he bum the call that he hath written.Then shall he kneel before the holy table, and it shall be given him to partakeof the mystery of the Aethyr.And concerning the ink with which he shall write; for the first Aethyr let it begold, for the second scarlet, for the third violet, for the fourth emerald, forthe fifth silver, for the sixth sapphire, for the seventh orange, for the eighthindigo, for the ninth gray, for the tenth black, for the eleventh maroon, forthe twelfth russet, for the thirteenth green-gray, for the fourteenth amber, forthe fifteenth olive, for the sixteenth pale blue, for the seventeenth crimson,for the eighteenth bright yellow, for the nineteenth crimson adorned withsilver, for the twentieth mauve, for the twenty-first pale green, for thetwenty-second rose-madder, for the twenty-third violet cobalt, for thetwenty-fourth beetle-brown, blue-brown colour, for the twenty-fifth a cold darkgray, for the twenty-sixth white flecked with red, blue, and yellow; the edgesof the letters shall be green, for the twenty-seventh angry clouds of ruddybrown, for the twenty-eighth indigo, for the twenty-ninth bluish-green, for thethirtieth mixed colours.This shall be the form to be used by him who would partake of the mystery of anyAethyr. And let him not change so much as the style of a letter, lest the holyword be blasphemed.And let him beware, after he hath been permitted to partake of this mystery,that he await the completion of the 91st hour of his retirement, before he openthe door of the place of his retirement; lest he contaminate his glory withuncleanness, and lest they that behold him be smitten by his glory unto death.For this is a holy mystery, and he that did first attain to reveal the alphabetthereof, perceived not one ten-thousandth part of the fringe that is upon itsvesture.Come away! for the clouds are gathered together, and the Aire heaveth like thewomb of a woman in travail. Come away! lest he loose the lightnings from hishand, and unleash his hounds of thunder. Come away! For the voice of the Aethyris accomplished. Come away! For the seal of His loving-kindness is made sure.And let there be praise and blessing unspeakable unto him that sitteth upon theHoly Throne, for he casteth down mercies as a spendthrift that scattereth gold.And he hath shut up judgment and hidden it away as a miser that hoardeth coinsof little worth.All this while the Angel hath been pushing me backwards, and now he is turnedinto a golden cross with a rose at its heart, and that is the red cross whereinis set the golden shew-stone.BOU-SAADA.December 1, 1909. 2:30-4:10 P.M.THE CRY OF THE 17TH AETHYRWHICH IS CALLED TANInto the stone there first cometh the head of a dragon, and then the AngelMadimi. She is not the mere elemental that one would suppose from the account ofCasaubon. I enquire why her form is different.She says: Since all things are God, in all things thou seest just so much of Godas thy capacity affordeth thee. But behold! Thou must pierce deeply into thisAethyr before true images appear. For TAN is that which transformeth judgmentinto justice. BAL is the sword, and TAN the balances.A pair of balances appears in the stone, and on the bar of the balance iswritten: Motion about a point is iniquity.And behind the balances is a plume, luminous, azure. And somehow connected withthe plume, but I cannot divine how, are these words: Breath is iniquity. (Thatis, any wind must stir the feather of truth.)And behind the plume is a shining filament of quartz, suspended vertically fromthe abyss to the abyss. And in the midst is a winged disk of some extremelydelicate, translucent substance, on which is written in the “dagger” alphabet:Torsion is iniquity. (This means, that the Rashith Ha-Gilgalim is the firstappearance of evil.)And now an Angel appears, like as he were carven in black diamonds. And hecries: Woe unto the Second, whom all nations of men call the First. Woe unto theFirst, whom all grades of Adepts call The First. Woe unto me, for I, even asthey, have worshipped him. But she in whose paps are the galaxies, and he thatnever shall be known, in them is no motion. For the infinite Without filleth alland moveth not, and the infinite Within goeth indeed; but it is no odds, elsewere the space-marks confounded.And now the Angel is but a shining speck of blackness in the midst of atremendous sphere of liquid and vibrating light, at first gold, then becominggreen, and lastly pure blue. And I see that the green of Libra is made up of theyellow of air and the blue of water, swords and cups, judgment and mercy. Andthis word TAN meaneth mercy. And the feather of Maat is blue because the truthof justice is mercy. And a voice cometh, as it were the music of the ripples ofthe surface of the sphere: Truth is delight. (This means that the Truth of theuniverse is delight.)Another voice cometh; it is the voice of a mighty Angel, all in silver; thescales of his armour and the plumes of his wings are like mother-of-pearl in aframework of silver. And he sayeth: Justice is the equity that ye have made foryourselves between truth and falsehood. But in Truth there is nothing of this,for there is only Truth. Your falsehood is but a little falser than your truth.Yet by your truth shall ye come to Truth. Your truth is your troth with Adonaithe Beloved one. And the Chymical Marriage of the Alchemists beginneth with aWeighing, and he that is not found wanting hath within him one spark of fire, sodense and so intense that it cannot be moved, though all the winds of heavenshould clamour against it, and all the waters of the abyss surge against it, andall the multitude of the earths heap themselves upon it to smother it. Nay, itshall not be moved.And this is the fire of which it is written: “Hear thou the voice of fire!” Andthe voice of fire is the second chapter of The Book of the Law, that is revealedunto him that is a score and half a score and three that are scores, and six, byAiwass, that is his guardian, the mighty Angel that extendeth from the firstunto the last, and maketh known the mysteries that are beyond. And the methodand the form of invocation whereby a man shall attain to the knowledge andconversation of his Holy Guardian Angel shall be given unto thee in the properplace, and seeing that the word is deadlier than lightning, do thou meditatestraitly thereupon, solitary, in a place where is no living thing visible, butonly the light of the sun. And thy head shall be bare.8[part0008.xhtml#vis-aft8] Thus mayest thou become fitted to receive this, theholiest of the Mysteries. And it is the holiest of the Mysteries because it isthe Next Step. And those Mysteries which lie beyond, though they be holier, arenot holy unto thee, but only remote. (The sense of this passage seems to be,that the holiness of a thing implies its personal relation with one, just as onecannot blaspheme an unknown god, because one does not know what to say to annoyhim. And this explains the perfect inefficiency of those who try to insult thesaints; the most violent attacks are very often merely clumsy compliments.)Now the Angel is spread completely over the globe, a dewy film of silver uponthat luminous blue.And a great voice cries: Behold the Queen of Heaven, how she hath woven herrobes from the loom of justice. For as that straight path of the Arrow cleavingthe Rainbow became righteousness in her that sitteth in the hall of doubletruth, so at last is she exalted unto the throne of the High Priestess, thePriestess of the Silver Star, wherein also is thine Angel made manifest. Andthis is the mystery of the camel that is ten days in the desert, and is notathirst, because he hath within him that water which is the dew distilled fromthe night of Nuit. Triple is the cord of silver, that it may not be loosed; andthree score and half a score and three is the number of the name of my name, forthat the ineffable wisdom, that also is of the sphere of the stars, informethme. Thus am I crowned with the triangle that is about the eye, and therefore ismy number three. And in me there is no imperfection, because through medescendeth the influence of TARO. And that is also the number of Aiwass themighty Angel, the Minister of Silence.And even as the shew-stone burneth thy forehead with its intolerable flame, sohe who hath known me, though but from afar, is marked out and chosen from amongmen, and he shall never turn back or turn aside, for he hath made the link thatis not to be broken, nay, not by the malice of the Four Great Princes of theevil of the world, nor by Choronzon, that mighty Devil, nor by the wrath of God,nor by the affliction and feebleness of the soul.Yet with this assurance be not thou content; for though thou hast the wings ofthe Eagle, they are vain, except they be joined to the shoulders of the Bull.Now, therefore, I send forth a shaft of my light, even as a ladder let down fromthe heaven upon the earth, and by this black cross of Themis that I hold beforethine eyes, do I swear unto thee that the path shall be open henceforth forevermore.There is a clash of a myriad silver cymbals, and silence. And then three times anote is struck upon a bell, which sounds like my holy Tibetan bell, that is madeof electrum magicum.I am happily returned unto the earth.BOU-SAADA.December 2, 1909. 12:15-2 A.M.THE CRY OF THE 16TH AETHYRWHICH IS CALLED LEAThere are faint and flickering images in a misty landscape, all very transient.But the general impression is of moonrise at midnight, and a crowned virginriding upon a bull.And they come up into the surface of the stone. And she is singing a chant ofpraise: Glory unto him that hath taken upon himself the image of toil. For byhis labour is my labour accomplished. For I, being a woman, lust ever to matemyself with some beast. And this is the salvation of the world, that always I amdeceived by some god, and that my child is the guardian of the labyrinth thathath two-and-seventy paths.Now she is gone.And now there are Angels, walking up and down in the stone. They are the Angelsof the Holy Sevenfold Table. It seems that they are waiting for the Angel of theAethyr to come forth.Now at last he appears in the gloom: He is a mighty King, with crown and orb andsceptre, and his robes are of purple and gold. And he casts down the orb andsceptre to the earth, and he tears off his crown, and throws it on the ground,and tramples it. And he tears out his hair, that is of ruddy gold tinged withsilver, and he plucks at his beard, and cries with a terrible voice: Woe unto methat am cast down from my place by the might of the new Aeon. For the tenpalaces are broken, and the ten kings are carried away into bondage, and theyare set to fight as the gladiators in the circus of him that hath laid his handupon eleven. For the ancient tower is shattered by the Lord of the Flame and theLightning. And they that walk upon their hands shall build the holy place.Blessed are they who have turned the Eye of Hoor unto the zenith, for they shallbe filled with the vigour of the goat.All that was ordered and stable is shaken. The Aeon of Wonders is come. Likelocusts shall they gather themselves together, the servants of the Star and ofthe Snake, and they shall eat up everything that is upon the earth. For why?Because the Lord of Righteousness delighteth in them.The prophets shall prophesy monstrous things, and the wizards shall performmonstrous things. The sorceress shall be desired of all men, and the enchantershall rule the earth.Blessing unto the name of the Beast, for he hath let loose a mighty flood offire from his manhood, and from his womanhood hath he let loose a mighty floodof water. Every thought of his mind is as a tempest that uprooteth the greattrees of the earth, and shaketh the mountains thereof. And the throne of hisspirit is a mighty throne of madness and desolation, so that they that look uponit shall cry: Behold the abomination!Of a single ruby shall that throne be built, and it shall be set upon an highmountain, and men shall see it afar off. Then will I gather together my chariotsand my horsemen and my ships of war. By sea and land shall my armies and mynavies encompass it, and I will encamp round about it, and besiege it, and bythe flame thereof shall I be utterly devoured. Many lying spirits have I sentinto the world that my Aeon might be established, and they shall all beoverthrown.Great is the Beast that cometh forth like a lion, the servant of the Star and ofthe Snake. He is the Eternal one; He is the Almighty one. Blessed are they uponwhom he shall look with favour, for nothing shall stand before his face.Accursed are they upon whom he shall look with derision, for nothing shall standbefore his face.And every mystery that hath not been revealed from the foundation of the worldhe shall reveal unto his chosen. And they shall have power over every spirit ofthe Ether; and of the earth and under the earth; on dry land and in the water;of whirling air and of rushing fire. And they shall have power over all theinhabitants of the earth, and every scourge of God shall be subdued beneaththeir feet. The angels shall come unto them and walk with them, and the greatgods of heaven shall be their guests.But I must sit apart, with dust upon my head, discrowned and desolate. I mustlurk in forbidden comers of the earth. I must plot secretly in the by-ways ofgreat cities, in the fog, and in marshes of the rivers of pestilence. And all mycunning shall not serve me. And all my undertakings shall be brought to naught.And the ministers of the Beast shall catch me and tear out my tongue withpincers of red-hot iron, and they shall brand my forehead with the word ofderision, and they shall shave my head, and pluck out my beard, and make a showof me.And the spirit of prophecy shall come upon me despite me ever and anon, as evennow upon my heart and upon my throat; and upon my tongue seared with strong acidare the words: Vim patior. For so must I give glory to him that hath supplantedme, that hath cast me down into the dust. I have hated him, and with hate mybones are rotten. I would have spat upon him, and my spittle hath befouled mybeard. I have taken up the sword against him, and I am fallen upon it, and mineentrails are about my feet.Who shall strive with his might? Hath he not the sword and the spear of theWarrior Lord of the Sun? Who shall contend with him? Who shall lift himself upagainst him? For the latchet of his sandal is more than the helmet of the MostHigh. Who shall reach up to him in supplication, save those that he shall setupon his shoulders ? Would God that my tongue were torn out by the roots, and mythroat cut across, and my heart tom out and given to the vultures, before I saythis that I must say: Blessing and Worship to the Prophet of the Lovely Star!And now he is fallen quite to the ground, in a heap, and dust is upon his head;and the throne upon which he sat is shattered into many pieces.And dimly dawning in this unutterable gloom, far, far above, is the face that isthe face of a man and of a woman, and upon the brow is a circle, and upon thebreast is a circle, and in the palm of the right hand is a circle. Gigantic ishis stature, and he hath the Uraeus crown, and the leopard's skin, and theflaming orange apron of a god. And invisibly about him is Nuit, and in his heartis Hadit, and between his feet is the great god Ra Hoor Khuit. And in his righthand is a flaming wand, and in his left a book. Yet is he silent; and that whichis understood between him and me shall not be revealed in this place. And themystery shall be revealed to whosoever shall say, with ecstasy of worship in hisheart, with a clear mind, and a passionate body: It is the voice of a god, andnot of a man.And now all that glory hath withdrawn itself; and the old King lies prostrate,abject.And the virgin that rode upon the bull cometh forth, led by all those Angels ofthe Holy Sevenfold Table, and they are dancing round her with garlands andsheaves of flowers, loose robes and hair dancing in the wind. And she smilesupon me with infinite brilliance, so that the whole Aethyr flushes warm, and shesays with a subtle sub-meaning, pointing downwards: By this, that.And I took her hand and kissed it, and I say to her: Am I not nearly purged ofthe iniquity of my forefathers?With that she bends down, and kisses me on the mouth, and says: “Yet a little,and on thy left arm shalt thou carry a man-child, and give him to drink of themilk of thy breasts. But I go dancing.”And I wave my hand, and the Aethyr is empty and dark, and I bow myself before itin the sign that I, and only I, may know. And I sink through waves of blackness,poised on an eagle, down, down, down.And I give the sign that only I may know.And now there is nothing in the stone but the black cross of Themis, and on itthese words: Memento: Sequor. (These words probably mean that the Equinox ofHorus is to be followed by that of Themis.)BOU-SAADA.December 2, 1909. 4:50-6:5 P.M.THE CRY OF THE 15TH AETHYRWHICH IS CALLED OXOThere appears immediately in the Aethyr a tremendous column of scarlet fire,whirling forth, rebounding, crying aloud. And about it are four columns of greenand blue and gold and silver, each inscribed with writings in the character ofthe dagger. And the column of fire is dancing among the pillars. Now it seemsthat the fire is but the skirt of the dancer, and the dancer is a mighty god.The vision is overpowering.As the dancer whirls, she chants in a strange, slow voice, quickening as shegoes: Lo! I gather up every spirit that is pure, and weave him into my vestureof flame. I lick up the lives of men, and their souls sparkle from mine eyes. Iam the mighty sorceress, the lust of the spirit. And by my dancing I gather formy mother Nuit the heads of all them that are baptised in the waters of life. Iam the lust of the spirit that eateth up the soul of man. I have prepared afeast for the adepts, and they that partake thereof shall see God.Now it is clear what she has woven in her dance; it is the Crimson Rose of 49Petals, and the Pillars are the Cross with which it is conjoined. And betweenthe pillars shoot out rays of pure green fire; and now all the pillars aregolden. She ceases to dance, and dwindles, gathering herself into the centre ofthe Rose.Now it is seen that the Rose is a vast amphitheatre, with seven tiers, each tierdivided into seven partitions. And they that sit in the Amphitheatre are theseven grades of the Order of the Rosy Cross. This Amphitheatre is built ofrose-coloured marble, and of its size I can say only that the sun might be usedas a ball to be thrown by the players in the arena. But in the arena there is alittle altar of emerald, and its top has the heads of the Four Beasts, inturquoise and rock crystal. And the floor of the arena is ridged like a gratingof lapis lazuli. And it is full of pure quicksilver.Above the altar is a veiled Figure, whose name is Pan. Those in the outer tieradore him as a Man; and in the next tier they adore him as a Goat; and in thenext tier they adore him as a Ram; and in the next tier they adore him as aCrab; and in the next tier they adore him as an Ibis; and in the next tier theyadore him as a Golden Hawk; and in the next tier they adore him not.And now the light streameth out from the altar, splashed out by the feet of himthat is above it. It is the Holy Twelvefold Table OIT.The voice of him that is above the altar is silence, but the echo thereof comethback from the walls of the circus, and is speech. And this is the speech: Threeand four are the days of a quarter of the moon, and on the seventh day is thesabbath, but thrice four is the Sabbath of the Adepts whereof the form isrevealed in the Aethyr ZID; that is the eighth of the Aires. And the mysteriesof the Table shall not be wholly revealed, nor shall they be revealed herein.But thou shalt gather of the sweat of thy brow a pool of clear water whereinthis shall be revealed. And of the oil that thou burnest in the midnight shallbe gathered together thirteen rivers of blessing; and of the oil and the water Iwill prepare a wine to intoxicate the young men and the maidens.And now the Table is become the universe; every star is a letter of the Book ofEnoch. And the Book of Enoch is drawn therefrom by an inscrutable Mystery, thatis known only to the Angels and the Holy Sevenfold Table. While I have beengazing upon this table, an Adept has come forth, one from each tier, except theinmost Tier.And the first drove a dagger into my heart, and tasted the blood, and said:Image [../Images/image00219.jpeg], Image [../Images/image00220.jpeg].And the second Adept has been testing the muscles of my right arm and shoulder,and he says: fortis, fortis, fortis, fortis, fortis.And the third Adept examines the skin and tastes the sweat of my left arm, andsays:TAN, TAN, TAN, TAN.And the fourth Adept examines my neck, and seems to approve, though he saysnothing; and he hath opened the right half of my brain, and he makes someexamination, and says: “Samajh, samajh, samajh.”And the fifth Adept examines the left half of my brain, and then holds up hishand in protest, and says “PLA...” (I cannot get the sentence, but the meaningis: In the thick darkness the seed awaiteth spring.)And now am I again rapt in contemplation of that universe of letters which arestars.The words ORLO, ILRO, TULE are three most secret names of God. They are Magicknames, each having an interpretation of the same kind as the interpretation ofI.N.R.I., and the name OIT, RLU, LRL, OOE are other names of God, that containmagical formulae, the first to invoke fire; the second, water; the third, air;and the fourth, earth.And if the Table be read diagonally, every letter, and every combination ofletters, is the name of a devil. And from these are drawn the formulae of evilmagick. But the holy letter I above the triad LLL dominateth the Table, andpreserveth the peace of the universe.And in the seven talismans about the central Table are contained the Mysteriesof drawing forth the letters. And the letters of the circumference declare theglory of Nuit, that beginneth from Aries.9 [part0008.xhtml#vis-aft9]All this while the Adepts have been chanting as it were an oratorio for seveninstruments. And this oratorio hath one dominant theme of rapture. Yet itapplieth to every detail of the universe as well as to the whole. And herein isChoronzon brought utterly to ruin, that all his Work is against his will, notonly in the whole, but in every part thereof, even as a fly that walketh upon aberyl-stone.And the tablet blazeth ever brighter till it filleth the whole Aire. And behold!there is one God therein, and the letters of the stars in his crown, Orion, andthe Pleiades, and Aldebaran, and Alpha Centauri, and Cor Leonis, and CorScorpionis, and Spica, and the pole-star, and Hercules, and Regulus, and Aquila,and the Ram's Eye.And upon a map of the stars shalt thou draw the sigil of that name; and becausealso some of the letters are alike, thou shalt know that the stars also havetribes and nations. The letter of a star is but the totem thereof. And theletter represented! not the whole nature of the star, but each star must beknown by itself in the wisdom of him that hath the Cynocephalus in leash.And this pertaineth unto the grade of a Magus—and that is beyond thine. (Allthis is communicated not by voice, or by writing; and there is no form in thestone, but only the brilliance of the Table. And now I am withdrawn from allthat, but the Rosy Cross of 49 petals is set upright upon the summit of apyramid, and all is dark, because of the exceeding light behind.)And there cometh a voice: The fly cried unto the ox, “Beware! Strengthenthyself. Set thy feet firmly upon the earth, for it is my purpose to alightbetween thy shoulders, and I would not harm thee.” So also are they who wishwell unto the Masters of the Pyramid.And the bee said unto the flower: “Give me of thine honey,” and the flower gaverichly thereof; but the bee, though he wit it not, carried the seed of theflower into many fields of sun. So also are they that take unto themselves theMasters of the Pyramid for servants.Now the exceeding light that was behind the Pyramid, and the Rosy Cross that isset thereon, hath fulfilled the whole Aire. The black Pyramid is like the backof a black diamond. Also the Rosy Cross is loosened, and the petals of the Roseare the mingled hues of sunset and of dawn; and the Cross is the Golden light ofnoon, and in the heart of the Rose there is the secret light that men callmidnight.And a voice: “Glory to God and thanksgiving to God, and there is no God but God.And He is exalted; He is great; and in the Sevenfold Table is His Name writopenly, and in the Twelvefold Table is His Name concealed.”And the Pyramid casts a shadow of itself into the sky, and the shadow spreadsover the whole stone. And an angel clad in blue and scarlet, with golden wingsand plumes of purple fire, comes forth and scatters disks of green and gold,filling all the Aire. And they become swiftly-whirling wheels, singing together.And the voice of the angel cries: Gather up thy garments about thee,10[part0008.xhtml#vis-aft10] O thou that hast entered the circle of the Sabbath;for in thy grave-clothes shouldest thou behold the resurrection.The flesh hangeth upon thee like his rags upon a beggar that is a pilgrim to theshrine of the Exalted One. Nevertheless, bear them bravely, and rejoice in thebeauty thereof, for the company of the pilgrims is a glad company, and they haveno care, and with song and dance and wine and fair women do they make merry. Andevery hostel is their palace, and every maid their queen.Gather up thy garments about thee, I say, for the voice of the Aethyr, that isthe voice of the Aeon, is ended, and thou art absorbed into the lesser night,and caught in the web of the light of thy mother in the word ARBADA-HARBA.And now the five and the six are divorced, and I am come again within my body.BOU-SAADA.December 3, 1909. 9:15 to 11:10 A.M.THE CRY OF THE 14TH AETHYRWHICH IS CALLED UTIThere come into the stone a white goat, a green dragon, and a tawny bull. Butthey pass away immediately. There is a veil of such darkness before the Aethyrthat it seems impossible to pierce it. But there is a voice saying: Behold, theGreat One of the Night of Time stirreth, and with his tail he churneth up theslime, and of the foam thereof shall he make stars. And in the battle of thePython and the Sphinx shall the glory be to the Sphinx, but the victory to thePython.Now the veil of darkness is formed of a very great number of exceedingly fineblack veils, and one tears them off one at a time. And the voice says, There isno light or knowledge or beauty or stability in the Kingdom of the Grave,whither thou goest. And the worm is crowned. All that thou wast hath he eatenup, and all that thou art is his pasture until to-morrow. And all that thoushalt be is nothing. Thou who wouldst enter the domain of the Great One of theNight of Time, this burden must thou take up. Deepen not a superficies.But I go on tearing down the veil that I may behold the vision of UTI, and hearthe voice thereof. And there is a voice: He hath drawn the black bean. Andanother voice answers it: Not otherwise could he plant the Rose. And the firstvoice: He hath drunk of the waters of death. The answer: Not otherwise could hewater the Rose. And the first voice: He hath burnt himself at the Fires of life.And the answer: Not otherwise could he sun the Rose. And the first voice is sofaint that I cannot hear it. But the answer is: Not otherwise could he pluck theRose.And still I go on, struggling with the blackness. Now there is an earthquake.The veil is tom into thousands of pieces that go flying away in a whirling wind.And there is an all-glorious Angel before me, standing in the sign of Apophisand Typhon. On his Forehead is a star, but all about him is darkness, and thecrying of beasts. And there are lamps moving in the darkness.And the Angel says: Depart! For thou must invoke me only in the darkness.Therein will I appear, and reveal unto thee the Mystery of UTI. For the Mysterythereof is great and terrible. And it shall not be spoken in sight of the sun.Therefore I withdraw myself. (Thus far the vision upon Da'leh Addin, a mountainin the desert near Bou-Saada.)December 3.2:50-3:15 P.M.THE ANGEL RE-APPEARSThe blackness gathers about, so thick, so clinging, so penetrating, sooppressive, that all the other darkness that I have ever conceived would be likebright light beside it.His voice comes in a whisper: O thou that art master of the fifty gates ofUnderstanding, is not my mother a black woman? O thou that art master of thePentagram, is not the egg of spirit a black egg? Here abideth terror, and theblind ache of the Soul, and lo! even I, who am the sole light, a spark shut up,stand in the sign of Apophis and Typhon.I am the snake that devoureth the spirit of man with the lust of light. I am thesightless storm in the night that wrappeth the world about with desolation.Chaos is my name, and thick darkness. Know thou that the darkness of the earthis ruddy, and the darkness of the air is grey, but the darkness of the soul isutter blackness.The egg of the spirit is a basilisk egg, and the gates of the understanding arefifty, that is the sign of the Scorpion. The pillars about the neophyte arecrowned with flame, and the vault of the Adepts is lighted by the Rose. And inthe abyss is the eye of the hawk. But upon the great sea shall the Master of theTemple find neither star nor moon.And I was about to answer him: “The light is within me.” But before I couldframe the words, he answered me with the great word that is the Key of theAbyss. And he said: Thou hast entered the night; dost thou yet lust for day?Sorrow is my name, and affliction. I am girt about with tribulation. Here stillhangs the Crucified One, and here the Mother weeps over the children that shehath not borne. Sterility is my name, and desolation. Intolerable is thine ache,and incurable thy wound. I said, Let the darkness cover me; and behold, I amcompassed about with the blackness that hath no name. O thou, who hast cast downthe light into the earth, so must thou do for ever. And the light of the sunshall not shine upon thee, and the moon shall not lend thee of her lustre, andthe stars shall be hidden, because thou art passed beyond these things, beyondthe need of these things, beyond the desire of these things.What I thought were shapes of rocks, rather felt than seen, now appear to beveiled Masters, sitting absolutely still and silent. Nor can any one bedistinguished from the others.And the Angel sayeth: Behold where thine Angel hath led thee! Thou didst askfame, power and pleasure, health and wealth and love, and strength, and lengthof days. Thou didst hold life with eight tentacles, like an octopus. Thou didstseek the four powers and the seven delights and the twelve emancipations and thetwo and twenty Privileges and the nine and forty Manifestations, and lo! thouart become as one of These. Bowed are their backs, whereon resteth the universe.Veiled are their faces, that have beheld the glory Ineffable.These adepts seem like Pyramids—their hoods and robes are like Pyramids.And the Angel sayeth: Verily is the Pyramid a Temple of Initiation. Verily alsois it a tomb. Thinkest thou that there is life within the Masters of the Temple,that sit hooded, encamped upon the Sea? Verily, there is no life in them.Their sandals were the pure light, and they have taken them from their feet andcast them down through the abyss, for this Aethyr is holy ground.Herein no forms appear, and the vision of God face to face, that is transmutedin the Athanor called dissolution, or hammered into one in the forge ofmeditation, is in this place but a blasphemy and a mockery.And the Beatific Vision is no more, and the glory of the Most High is no more.There is no more knowledge. There is no more bliss. There is no more power.There is no more beauty. For this is the Palace of Understanding: for thou artone with the Primeval things.Drink in the myrrh of my speech, that is bruised with the gall of the roc, anddissolved in the ink of the cuttlefish, and perfumed with the deadly nightshade.This is thy wine, who wast drunk upon the wine of Iacchus. And for bread shaltthou eat salt, O thou on the corn of Ceres that didst wax fat! For as pure beingis pure nothing, so is pure wisdom pure——,11 [part0008.xhtml#vis-aft11] and sois pure understanding silence, and stillness, and darkness. The eye is calledseventy, and the triple Aleph whereby thou perceivest it, divideth into thenumber of the terrible word that is the Key of the Abyss.I am Hermes, that am sent from the Father to expound all things discreetly inthese the last words that thou shalt hear before thou take thy seat among these,whose eyes are sealed up, and whose ears are stopped, and whose mouths areclenched, who are folded in upon themselves, the liquor of whose bodies is driedup, so that nothing remains but a little pyramid of dust.And that bright light of comfort, and that piercing sword of truth, and all thatpower and beauty that they have made of themselves, is cast from them, as it iswritten, “I saw Satan like lightning fall from Heaven.” And as a flaming swordis it dropt through the abyss, where the four beasts keep watch and ward. And itappeareth in the heaven of Jupiter as a morning star, or as an evening star. Andthe light thereof shineth even unto the earth, and bringeth hope and help tothem that dwell in the darkness of thought, and drink of the poison of life.Fifty are the gates of understanding, and one hundred and six are the seasonsthereof. And the name of every season is Death.During all this speech, the figure of the Angel has dwindled and flickered, andnow it is gone out.And I come back in the body, rushing like a flame in a great wind. And theshew-stone has become warm, and in it is its own light.BOU-SAADA.December 3, 1909. 9:50-11:15 P.M.THE CRY OF THE 13TH AETHYRWHICH IS CALLED ZIMInto the Stone there cometh an image of shining waters, glistening in the sun.Unfathomable is their beauty, for they are limpid, and the floor is of gold. Yetthe sense thereof is of fruitlessness.And an Angel cometh forth, of pure pale gold, walking upon the water. Above hishead is a rainbow, and the water foams beneath his feet. And he saith: Beforehis face am I come that hath the thirty-three thunders of increase in his hand.From the golden water shalt thou gather corn.All the Aire behind him is gold, but it opens as it were a veil. There are twoterrible black giants, wrestling in mortal hatred. And there is a little birdupon a bush, and the bird flaps its wings. Thereat the strength of the giantssnaps, and they fall in heaps to the earth, as though all their bones weresuddenly broken.And now waves of light roll through the Aethyr, as if they were playing.Therefore suddenly I am in a garden, upon a terrace of a great castle, that isupon a rocky mountain. In the garden are fountains and many flowers. There aregirls also in the garden, tall, slim, delicate and pale. And now I see that theflowers are the girls, for they change from one to another; so varied, andlucent, and harmonious is all this garden, that it seems like a great opal.A voice comes: This water which thou seest is called the water of death. ButNEMO hath filled therefrom our springs.And I said: Who is NEMO?And the voice answered: A dolphin's tooth, and a ram's horns, and the hand of aman that is hanged, and the phallus of a goat. (By this I understand that nun isexplained by shin, and he by resh, and mem by yod, and ayin by tau. NEMO istherefore called 165 = 11 × 15; and is in himself 910 = 91 Amen × 10; and 13 ×70 = The One Eye, Achad Ayin.)And now there cometh an Angel into the garden, but he hath not any of theattributes of the former Angels, for he is like a young man, dressed in whitelinen robes.And he saith: No man hath beheld the face of my Father. Therefore he that hathbeheld it is called NEMO. And know thou that every man that is called NEMO hatha garden that he tendeth. And every garden that is and flourisheth hath beenprepared from the desert by NEMO, watered with the waters that were calleddeath.And I say unto him: To what end is the garden prepared?And he saith: First for the beauty and delight thereof; and next because it iswritten, “And Tetragrammaton Elohim planted a garden eastward in Eden.” Andlastly, because though every flower bringeth forth a maiden, yet is there oneflower that shall bring forth a man-child. And his name shall be called NEMO,when he beholdeth the face of my Father. And he that tendeth the garden seekethnot to single out the flower that shall be NEMO. He doeth naught but tend thegarden.And I said: Pleasant indeed is the garden, and light is the toil of tending it,and great is the reward.And he said: Bethink thee that NEMO hath beheld the face of my Father. In Him isonly Peace.And I said: Are all gardens like unto this garden?And he waved his hand, and in the Aire across the valley appeared an island ofcoral, rosy, with green palms and fruit trees, in the midst of the bluest of theseas.And he waved his hand again, and there appeared a valley shut in by mighty snowmountains, and in it were pleasant streams of water, rushing through, and broadrivers, and lakes covered with lilies.And he waved his hand again, and there was a vision, as it were of an oasis inthe desert.And again he waved his hand, and there was a dim country with grey rocks, andheather, and gorse, and bracken.And he waved his hand yet again, and there was a park, and a small housetherein, surrounded by yews. This time the house opens, and I see in it an oldman, sitting by the table. He is blind. Yet he writeth in a great book,constantly. I see what he is writing: “The words of the Book are as the leavesof the flowers in the garden. Many indeed of these my songs shall go forth asmaidens, but there is one among them, which one I know not, that shall be aman-child, whose name shall be NEMO, when he hath beheld the face of the Father,and become blind.”(All this vision is most extraordinarily pleasant and peaceful, entirely withoutstrength or ecstasy, or any positive quality, but equally free from theopposites of any of those qualities.) And the young man seems to read mythought, which is, that I should love to stay in this garden and do nothing forever; for he sayeth to me: Come with me, and behold how NEMO tendeth his garden.So we enter the earth, and there is a veiled figure, in absolute darkness. Yetit is perfectly possible to see in it, so that the minutest details do notescape us. And upon the root of one flower he pours acid so that that rootwrithes as if in torture. And another he cuts, and the shriek is like the shriekof a mandrake, torn up by the roots. And another he chars with fire, and yetanother he anoints with oil.And I said: Heavy is the labour, but great indeed is the reward.And the young man answered me: He shall not see the reward; he tendeth thegarden.And I said: What shall come unto him?And he said: This thou canst not know, nor is it revealed by the letters thatare the totems of the stars, but only by the stars.And he says to me, quite disconnectedly: The man of earth is the adherent. Thelover giveth his life unto the work among men. The hermit goeth solitary, andgiveth only of his light unto men.And I ask him: Why does he tell me that?And he says: I tell thee not. Thou tellest thyself, for thou hast ponderedthereupon for many days, and hast not found light. And now that thou art calledNEMO, the answer to every riddle that thou hast not found shall spring up in thymind, unsought. Who can tell upon what day a flower shall bloom?And thou shalt give thy wisdom unto the world, and that shall be thy garden. Andconcerning time and death, thou hast naught to do with these things. For thougha precious stone be hidden in the sand of the desert, it shall not heed for thewind of the desert, although it be but sand. For the worker of works hath workedthereupon; and because it is clear, it is invisible; and because it is hard, itmoveth not.All these words are heard by everyone that is called NEMO. And with that doth heapply himself to understanding. And he must understand the virtue of the watersof death, and he must understand the virtue of the sun and the wind, and of theworm that turneth the earth, and of the stars that roof in the garden. And hemust understand the separate nature and property of every flower, or how shallhe tend his garden?And I said to him: Concerning the Vision and the Voice, I would know if thesethings be of the essence of the Aethyr, or of the essence of the seer.And he answers: It is of the essence of him that is called NEMO, combined withthe essence of the Aethyr, for from the 1st Aethyr to the 15th Aethyr, there isno vision and no voice, save for him that is called NEMO. And he that seekeththe vision and the voice therein is led away by dog-faced demons that show nosign of truth, seducing from the Sacred Mysteries, unless his name be NEMO.And hadst thou not been fitted, thou too hadst been led away, for before thegate of the 15 th Aethyr, is this written: He shall send them strong delusion,that they should believe a lie. And again it is written: The Lord hardenedPharaoh's heart. And again it is written that God tempteth man. But thou hadstthe word and the sign, and thou hadst authority from thy superior, and licence.And thou hast done well in that thou didst not dare, and in that thou dost dare.For daring is not presumption.And he said moreover: Thou dost well to keep silence, for I perceive how manyquestions arise in thy mind; yet already thou knowest that the answering, as theasking, must be vain. For NEMO hath all in himself. He hath come where there isno light or knowledge, only when he needeth them no more.And then we bow silently, giving a certain sign, called the Sign of IsisRejoicing. And then he remaineth to ward the Aethyr, while I return unto thebank of sand that is the bed of the river near the desert.THE RIVER-BED NEAR BOU-SAADA.December 4, 1909. 2:10-3:45 P.M.THE CRY OF THE 12TH AETHYRWHICH IS CALLED LOEThere appear in the stone two pillars of flame, and in the midst is a chariot ofwhite fire.This seems to be the chariot of the Seventh Key of the Tarot. But it is drawn byfour sphinxes, diverse, like the four sphinxes upon the door of the vault of theadepts, counterchanged in their component parts.The chariot itself is the lunar crescent, waning. The canopy is supported byeight pillars of amber. These pillars are upright, and yet the canopy which theysupport is the whole vault of night.The charioteer is a man in golden armour, studded with sapphires, but over hisshoulders is a white robe, and over that a red robe. Upon his golden helmet hebeareth for his crest a crab. His hands are clasped upon a cup, from whichradiates a ruddy glow, constantly increasing, so that everything is blotted outby its glory, and the whole Aire is filled with it.And there is a marvellous perfume in the Aire, like unto the perfume of Ra HoorKhuit, but sublimated, as if the quintessence of that perfume alone were burnt.For it hath the richness and voluptuousness and humanity of blood, and thestrength and freshness of meal, and the sweetness of honey, and the purity ofolive-oil, and the holiness of that oil which is made of myrrh, and cinnamon,and galangal.The charioteer speaks in a low, solemn voice, aweinspiring, like a very largeand very distant bell: Let him look upon the cup whose blood is mingled therein,for the wine of the cup is the blood of the saints. Glory unto the ScarletWoman, Babylon the Mother of Abominations, that rideth upon the Beast, for shehath spilt their blood in every corner of the earth, and lo! she hath mingled itin the cup of her whoredom.With the breath of her kisses hath she fermented it, and it hath become the wineof the Sacrament, the wine of the Sabbath; and in the Holy Assembly hath shepoured it out for her worshippers, and they have become drunken thereon, so thatface to face have they beheld my Father. Thus are they made worthy to becomepartakers of the Mystery of this holy vessel, for the blood is the life. Sositteth she from age to age, and the righteous are never weary of her kisses,and by her murders and fornications she seduceth the world. Therein ismanifested the glory of my Father, who is truth.(This wine is such that its virtue radiateth through the cup, and I reel underthe intoxication of it. And every thought is destroyed by it. It abideth alone,and its name is Compassion. I understand by “Compassion,” the sacrament ofsuffering, partaken of by the true worshippers of the Highest. And it is anecstasy in which there is no trace of pain. Its passivity [ = passion] is likethe giving-up of the self to the beloved.)The voice continues: This is the Mystery of Babylon, the Mother of abominations,and this is the mystery of her adulteries, for she hath yielded up herself toeverything that liveth, and hath become a partaker in its mystery. And becauseshe hath made herself the servant of each, therefore is she become the mistressof all. Not as yet canst thou comprehend her glory.Beautiful art thou, O Babylon, and desirable, for thou hast given thyself toeverything that liveth, and thy weakness hath subdued their strength. For inthat union thou didst understand. Therefore art thou called Understanding, OBabylon, Lady of the Night!This is that which is written, “O my God, in one last rapture let me attain tothe union with the many.” For she is Love, and her love is one, and she hathdivided the one love into infinite loves, and each love is one, and equal withThe One, and therefore is she passed “from the assembly and the law and theenlightenment unto the anarchy of solitude and darkness. For ever thus must sheveil the brilliance of Her Self.”O Babylon, Babylon, thou mighty Mother, that ridest upon the crowned beast, letme be drunken upon the wine of thy fornications; let thy kisses wanton me untodeath, that even I, thy cup-bearer, may understand.Now, through the ruddy glow of the cup, I may perceive far above, and infinitelygreat, the vision of Babylon. And the Beast whereon she rideth is the Lord ofthe City of the Pyramids, that I beheld in the fourteenth Aethyr.Now that is gone in the glow of the cup, and the Angel saith: Not as yet mayestthou understand the mystery of the Beast, for it pertaineth not unto the mysteryof this Aire, and few that are new-born unto Understanding are capable thereof.The cup glows ever brighter and fierier. All my sense is unsteady, being smittenwith ecstasy.And the Angel sayeth: Blessed are the saints, that their blood is mingled in thecup, and can never be separate any more. For Babylon the Beautiful, the Motherof abominations, hath sworn by her holy cteis, whereof every point is a pang,that she will not rest from her adulteries until the blood of everything thatliveth is gathered therein, and the wine thereof laid up and matured andconsecrated, and worthy to gladden the heart of my Father. For my Father isweary with the stress of eld, and cometh not to her bed. Yet shall this perfectwine be the quintessence, and the elixir, and by the draught thereof shall herenew his youth; and so shall it be eternally, as age by age the worlds dodissolve and change, and the universe unfoldeth itself as a Rose, and shuttethitself up as the Cross that is bent into the cube.And this is the comedy of Pan, that is played at night in the thick forest. Andthis is the mystery of Dionysus Zagreus, that is celebrated upon the holymountain of Kithairon. And this is the secret of the brothers of the Rosy Cross;and this is the heart of the ritual that is accomplished in the Vault of theAdepts that is hidden in the Mountain of the Caverns, even the Holy MountainAbiegnus.And this is the meaning of the Supper of the Passover, the spilling of the bloodof the Lamb being a ritual of the Dark Brothers, for they have sealed up thePylon with blood, lest the Angel of Death should enter therein. Thus do theyshut themselves off from the company of the saints. Thus do they keep themselvesfrom compassion and from understanding. Accursèd are they, for they shut uptheir blood in their heart.They keep themselves from the kisses of my Mother Babylon, and in their lonelyfortresses they pray to the false moon. And they bind themselves together withan oath, and with a great curse. And of their malice they conspire together, andthey have power, and mastery, and in their cauldrons do they brew the harsh wineof delusion, mingled with the poison of their selfishness.Thus they make war upon the Holy One, sending forth their delusion upon men, andupon everything that liveth. So that their false compassion is calledcompassion, and their false understanding is called understanding, for this istheir most potent spell.Yet of their own poison do they perish, and in their lonely fortresses shallthey be eaten up by Time that hath cheated them to serve him, and by the mightydevil Choronzon, their master, whose name is the Second Death, for the bloodthat they have sprinkled on their Pylon, that is a bar against the Angel Death,is the key by which he entereth in.12 [part0008.xhtml#vis-aft12]The Angel sayeth: And this is the word of double power in the voice of theMaster, wherein the Five interpenetrateth the Six. This is its secretinterpretation that may not be understood, save only of them that understand.And for this is it the Key of the Pylon of Power, because there is no power thatmay endure, save only the power that descendeth in this my chariot from Babylon,the city of the Fifty Gates, the Gate of the God On (Image[../Images/image00221.jpeg]). Moreover is On the Key of the Vault that is 120.So also do the Majesty and the Beauty derive from the Supernal Wisdom.But this is a mystery utterly beyond thine understanding. For Wisdom is the Man,and Understanding the Woman, and not until thou hast perfectly understood canstthou begin to be wise. But I reveal unto thee a mystery of the Aethyrs, that notonly are they bound up with the Sephiroth, but also with the Paths. Now, theplane of the Aethyrs interpenetrateth and surroundeth the universe wherein theSephiroth are established, and therefore is the order of the Aethyrs not theorder of the Tree of Life. And only in a few places do they coincide. But theknowledge of the Aethyrs is deeper than the knowledge of the Sephiroth, for thatin the Aethyrs is the knowledge of the Aeons, and of Image[../Images/image00222.jpeg]. And to each shall it be given according to hiscapacity. (He has been saying certain secret things to the unconscious mind ofthe seer, of a personal nature.)Now a voice comes from without: And lo! I saw you to the end.And a great bell begins to toll. And there come six little children out of thefloor of the chariot, and in their hands is a veil so fine and transparent thatit is hardly visible. Yet, when they put it over the Cup, the Angel bowing hishead reverently, the light of the Cup goes out entirely. And as the light of theCup vanishes, it is like a swift sunset in the whole Aire, for it was from thelight of that Cup alone that it was lighted.And now the light is all gone out of the stone, and I am very cold.BOU-SAADA.December 4-5, 1909. 11:30 P.M.–1:20 A.M.THE CRY OF THE 11TH AETHYRWHICH IS CALLED IKHThere appears in the stone immediately the Kamea of the Moon. And it is rolledup; and behind it there appeareth a great Host of Angels. Their backs are turnedtowards me, but I can see how tremendous are their arms, which are swords andspears. They have wings upon their helmets and their heels; they are clad incomplete armour, and the least of their swords is like the breaking forth of atremendous storm of lightning. The least of their spears is like a greatwater-spout. On their shields are the eyes of Tetragrammaton, winged withflame,—white, red, black, yellow and blue. On their flanks are vast squadrons ofelephants, and behind them is their meteor-artillery. They that sit upon theelephants are armed with the thunderbolt of Zeus.Now in all that host there is no motion. Yet they are not resting upon theirarms, but tense and vigilant. And between them and me is the God Shu, whombefore I did not see, because his force filleth the whole Aethyr. And indeed heis not visible in his form. Nor does he come to the seer through any of thesenses; he is understood, rather than expressed.I perceive that all this army is defended by fortresses, nine mighty towers ofiron upon the frontier of the Aethyr. Each tower is filled with warriors insilver armour. It is impossible to describe the feeling of tension; they arelike oarsmen waiting for the gun.I perceive that an Angel is standing on either side of me; nay, I am in themidst of a company of armed angels, and their captain is standing in front ofme. He too is clad in silver armour; and about him, closely wrapped to his body,is a whirling wind, so swift that any blow struck against him would be broken.And he speaketh unto me these words:Behold, a mighty guard against the terror of things, the fastness of the MostHigh, the legions of eternal vigilance; these are they that keep watch and wardday and night throughout the aeons. Set in them is all the force of the MightyOne, yet there stirreth not one plume of the wings of their helmets.Behold, the foundation of the Holy City, the towers and the bastions thereof!Behold the armies of light that are set against the outermost Abyss, against thehorror of emptiness, and the malice of Choronzon. Behold how worshipful is thewisdom of the Master, that he hath set his stability in the all-wandering Airand in the changeful Moon. In the purple flashes of the lightning hath Hewritten the word Eternity, and in the wings of the swallow hath He appointedrest.By three and by three and by three hath He made firm the foundation against theearthquake that is three. For in the number nine is the changefulness of thenumbers brought to naught. For with whatsoever number thou wilt cover it, itappeareth unchanged.These things are spoken unto him that understandeth, that is a breastplate untothe elephants, or a corselet unto the angels, or a scale upon the towers ofiron; yet is this mighty host set only for a defence, and whoso passeth beyondtheir lines hath no help in them.Yet must he that understandeth go forth unto the outermost Abyss, and there musthe speak with him that is set above the four-fold terror, the Princes of Evil,even with Choronzon, the mighty devil that inhabiteth the outermost Abyss. Andnone may speak with him, or understand him, but the servants of Babylon, thatunderstand, and they that are without understanding, his servants.Behold! it entereth not into the heart, nor into the mind of man to conceivethis matter; for the sickness of the body is death, and the sickness of theheart is despair, and the sickness of the mind is madness. But in the outermostAbyss is sickness of the aspiration, and sickness of the will, and sickness ofthe essence of all, and there is neither word nor thought wherein the image ofits image is reflected.And whoso passeth into the outermost Abyss, except he be of them thatunderstand, holdeth out his hands, and boweth his neck, unto the chains ofChoronzon. And as a devil he walketh about the earth, immortal, and he blasteththe flowers of the earth, and he corrupteth the fresh air, and he makethpoisonous the water; and the fire that is the friend of man, and the pledge ofhis aspiration, seeing that it mounteth ever upward as a pyramid, and seeingthat man stole it in a hollow tube from Heaven, even that fire he turneth untoruin, and madness, and fever, and destruction. And thou, that art an heap of drydust in the city of the pyramids, must understand these things.And now a thing happens, which is unfortunately sheer nonsense; for the Aethyrthat is the foundation of the universe was attacked by the Outermost Abyss, andthe only way that I can express it is by saying that the universe was shaken.But the universe was not shaken. And that is the exact truth; so that therational mind which is interpreting these spiritual things is offended; but,being trained to obey, it setteth down that which it doth not understand. Forthe rational mind indeed reasoneth, but never attaineth unto Understanding; butthe Seer is of them that understand.And the Angel saith:Behold, He hath established His mercy and His might, and unto His might is addedvictory, and unto His mercy is added splendour. And all these things hath Heordered in beauty, and He hath set them firmly upon the Eternal Rock, andtherefrom He hath suspended His kingdom as one pearl that is set in a jewel ofthreescore pearls and twelve. And He hath garnished it with the Four Holy LivingCreatures for Guardians, and He hath graven therein the seal of righteousness,13[part0008.xhtml#vis-aft13] and He hath burnished it with the fire of His Angel,and the blush of His loveliness informeth it, and with delight and with wit hathHe made it merry at the heart, and the core thereof is the Secret of His being,and therein is His name Generation. And this His stability hath the number 80,for that the price thereof is War.14 [part0008.xhtml#vis-aft14]Beware, therefore, O thou who art appointed to understand the secret of theOutermost Abyss, for in every Abyss thou must assume the mask and form of theAngel thereof. Hadst thou a name, thou wert irrevocably lost. Search, therefore,if there be yet one drop of blood that is not gathered into the cup of Babylonthe Beautiful, for in that little pile of dust, if there could be one drop ofblood, it should be utterly corrupt; it should breed scorpions and vipers, andthe cat of slime.And I said unto the Angel:Is there not one appointed as a warden?And he said:Eloi, Eloi, lama sabacthani.Such an ecstasy of anguish racks me that I cannot give it voice, yet I know itis but as the anguish of Gethsemane. And that is the last word of the Aethyr.The outposts are passed, and before the seer extends the outermost Abyss.I am returned.BOU-SAADA.December 5, 1909. 10:10-11:35 P.M.In nomine BABALONAmenRestriction unto ChoronzonTHE TENTH AETHYR IS CALLED ZAXThis Aethyr being accursed, and the seer forewarned, he taketh these precautionsfor the scribe.First let the scribe be seated in the centre of the circle in the desert sand,and let the circle be fortified by the Holy Names of God—Tetragrammaton andShaddai El Chai and Ararita.And let the Demon be invoked within a triangle, wherein is inscribed the name ofChoronzon, and about it let him write ANAPHAXETON-ANAPHANETON-PRIMEUMATON, andin the angles MI-CA-EL: and at each angle the Seer shall slay a pigeon, andhaving done this, let him retire to a secret place, where is neither sight norhearing, and sit within his black robe, secretly invoking the Aethyr. And letthe Scribe perform the Banishing Rituals of the Pentagram and Hexagram, and lethim call upon the Holy Names of God, and say the Exorcism of Honorius, and lethim beseech protection and help of the Most High.And let him be furnished with the Magick Dagger, and let him strike fearlesslyat anything that may seek to break through the circle, were it the appearance ofthe Seer himself. And if the Demon pass out of the triangle, let him threatenhim with the Dagger, and command him to return. And let him beware lest hehimself lean beyond the circle. And since he reverenceth the Person of the Seeras his Teacher, let the Seer bind him with a great Oath to do this.Now, then, the Seer being entered within the triangle, let him take the Victimsand cut their throats, pouring the blood within the Triangle, and being mostheedful that not one drop fall without the Triangle; or else Choronzon should beable to manifest in the universe.And when the sand hath sucked up the blood of the victims, let him recite theCall of the Aethyr apart secretly as aforesaid. Then will the Vision berevealed, and the Voice heard.THE OATHI, Omnia Vincam, a Probationer of A Image [../Images/image00208.jpeg] A Image[../Images/image00208.jpeg], hereby solemnly promise upon my magical honour, andswear by Adonai the angel that guardeth me, that I will defend this magic circleof Art with thoughts and words and deeds. I promise to threaten with the Daggerand command back into the triangle the spirit incontinent, if he should striveto escape from it; and to strike with a Dagger at anything that may seek toenter this Circle, were it in appearance the body of the Seer himself. And Iwill be exceeding wary, armed against force and cunning; and I will preservewith my life the inviolability of this Circle, Amen.And I summon mine Holy Guardian Angel to witness this mine oath, the which if Ibreak, may I perish, forsaken of Him. Amen and Amen.THE CRY OF THE 10TH AETHYRTHAT IS CALLED ZAXThere is no being in the outermost Abyss, but constant forms come forth from thenothingness of it.Then the Devil of the Aethyr, that mighty devil Choronzon, crieth aloud, Zazas,Zazas, Nasatanada Zazas.I am the Master of Form, and from me all forms proceed.I am I. I have shut myself up from the spendthrifts, my gold is safe in mytreasure-chamber, and I have made every living thing my concubine, and noneshall touch them, save only I. And yet I am scorched, even while I shiver in thewind. He hateth me and tormenteth me. He would have stolen me from myself, but Ishut myself up and mock at him, even while he plagueth me. From me come leprosyand pox and plague and cancer and cholera and the falling sickness. Ah! I willreach up to the knees of the Most High, and tear his phallus with my teeth, andI will bray his testicles in a mortar, and make poison thereof, to slay the sonsof men.(Here the Spirit simulated the voice of Frater P., which also appeared to comefrom his station and not from the triangle.)I don't think I can get any more; I think that's all there is.(The Frater was seated in a secret place covered completely by a black robe, inthe position called the “Thunderbolt.” He did not move or speak during theceremony.)Next the Scribe was hallucinated, believing that before him was a beautifulcourtesan whom previously he had loved in Paris. Now, she wooed him with softwords and glances, but he knew these things for delusions of the devil, and hewould not leave the circle.The demon then laughed wildly and loud.(Upon the Scribe threatening him, the Demon proceeded, after a short delay.)They have called me the God of laughter, and I laugh when I will slay. And theyhave thought that I could not smile, but I smile upon whom I would seduce, Oinviolable one, that canst not be tempted. If thou canst command me by the powerof the Most High, know that I did indeed tempt thee, and it repenteth me. I bowmyself humbly before the great and terrible names whereby thou hast conjured andconstrained me. But thy name is mercy, and I cry aloud for pardon. Let me comeand put my head beneath thy feet, that I may serve thee. For if thou commandestme to obedience in the Holy names, I cannot swerve therefrom, for their firstwhispering is greater than the noise of all my tempests. Bid me therefore comeunto thee upon my hands and knees that I may adore thee, and partake of thyforgiveness. Is not thy mercy infinite?(Here Choronzon attempts to seduce the Scribe by appealing to his pride.)(But the Scribe refused to be tempted, and commanded the demon to continue withthe Aethyr.)(There was again a short delay.)Choronzon hath no form, because he is the maker of all form; and so rapidly hechangeth from one to the other as he may best think fit to seduce those whom hehateth, the servants of the Most High.Thus taketh he the form of a beautiful woman, or of a wise and holy man, or of aserpent that writheth upon the earth ready to sting.And, because he is himself, therefore he is no self; the terror of darkness, andthe blindness of night, and the deafness of the adder, and the tastelessness ofstale and stagnant water, and the black fire of hatred, and the udders of theCat of slime; not one thing, but many things. Yet, with all that, his torment iseternal. The sun burns him as he writhes naked upon the sands of hell, and thewind cuts him bitterly to the bone a harsh dry wind, so that he is sore athirst.Give unto me, I pray thee, one drop of water from the pure springs of Paradise,that I may quench my thirst.(The Scribe refused.)Sprinkle water upon my head. I can hardly go on.(This last was spoken from the triangle in the natural voice of the Frater,which Choronzon again simulated. But he did not succeed in taking the Frater'sform—which was absurd!)(The Scribe resisted the appeal to his pity, and conjured the demon to proceedby the names of the Most High. Choronzon attempted also to seduce thefaithfulness of the Scribe. A long colloquy ensued. The Scribe cursed him by theHoly Names of God, and the power of the Pentagram.)I feed upon the names of the Most High. I churn them in my jaws, and I void themfrom my fundament. I fear not the power of the Pentagram, for I am the Master ofthe Triangle. My name is three hundred and thirty and three, and that is thriceone. Be vigilant, therefore, for I warn thee that I am about to deceive thee. Ishall say words that thou wilt take to be the cry of the Aethyr, and thou wiltwrite them down, thinking them to be great secrets of Magick power, and theywill be only my jesting with thee.(Here the Scribe invoked Angels, and the Holy Guardian Angel of the Frater P.... The demon replied:)I know the name of the Angel of thee and thy brother P. . . and all thy dealingswith him are but a cloak for thy filthy sorceries.(Here the Scribe averred that he knew more than the demon, and so feared himnot, and ordered the demon to proceed.)Thou canst tell me naught that I know not, for in me is all Knowledge: Knowledgeis my name. Is not the head of the great Serpent arisen into Knowledge?(Here the Scribe again commanded Choronzon to continue with the call.)Know thou that there is no Cry in the tenth Aethyr like unto the other Cries,for Choronzon is Dispersion, and cannot fix his mind upon any one thing for anylength of time. Thou canst master him in argument, O talkative one; thou wastcommanded, wast thou not, to talk to Choronzon ? He sought not to enter thecircle, or to leave the triangle, yet thou didst prate of all these things.(Here the Scribe threatened the demon with anger and pain and hell. The demonreplied:)Thinkest thou, O fool, that there is any anger and any pain that I am not, orany hell but this my spirit?Images, images, images, all without control, all without reason. The malice ofChoronzon is not the malice of a being; it is the quality of malice, because hethat boasteth himself “I am I,” hath in truth no self, and these are they thatare fallen under my power, the slaves of the Blind One that boasteth himself tobe the Enlightened One. For there is no centre, nay, nothing but Dispersion.Woe, woe, woe, threefold to him that is led away by talk, O talkative One.O thou that hast written two-and-thirty books of Wisdom, and art more stupidthan an owl, by thine own talk is thy vigilance wearied, and by my talk art thoubefooled and tricked, O thou that sayest that thou shalt endure. Knowest thouhow nigh thou art to destruction? For thou that art the Scribe hast not theunderstanding15 [part0008.xhtml#vis-aft15] that alone availeth againstChoronzon. And wert thou not protected by the Holy Names of God and the circle,I would rush upon thee and tear thee. For when I made myself like unto abeautiful woman, if thou hadst come to me, I would have rotted thy body with thepox, and thy liver with cancer, and I would have torn off thy testicles with myteeth. And if I had seduced thy pride, and thou hadst bidden me to come into thecircle, I would have trampled thee under foot, and for a thousand years shouldstthou have been but one of the tape-worms that is in me. And if I had seduced thypity, and thou hadst poured one drop of water without the circle, then would Ihave blasted thee with flame. But I was not able to prevail against thee.How beautiful are the shadows of the ripples of the sand!Would God that I were dead.For know that I am proud and revengeful and lascivious, and I prate even asthou. For even as I walked among the Sons of God, I heard it said that P . . .could both will and know, and might learn at length to dare, but that to keepsilence he should never learn. O thou that art so ready to speak, so slow towatch, thou art delivered over unto my power for this. And now one word wasnecessary unto me, and I could not speak it. I behold the beauty of the earth inher desolation, and greater far is mine, who sought to be my naked self. Knowestthou that in my soul is utmost fear? And such is my force and my cunning, that ahundred times have I been ready to leap, and for fear have missed. And athousand times am I baulked by them of the City of the Pyramids, that set snaresfor my feet. More knowledge have I than the Most High, but my will is broken,and my fierceness is marred by fear, and I must ever speak, speak, speak,millions of mad voices in my brain.With a heart of furious fancies,Where of I am Commander,With a burning spearAnd a horse of AirTo the wilderness I wander.(The idea was to keep the Scribe busy writing, so as to spring upon him. For,while the Scribe talked, Choronzon had thrown sand into the circle, and filledit up. But Choronzon could not think fast and continuously, and so resorted tothe device of quotation.)(The Scribe had written two or three words of “Tom o'Bedlam,” when Choronzonsprang within the circle [that part of the circumference of which that wasnearest to him he had been filling up with sand all this time] and leaped uponthe Scribe, throwing him to the earth. The conflict took place within thecircle. The Scribe called upon Tetragrammaton, and succeeded in compellingChoronzon to return into his triangle. By dint of anger and of threatening himwith the Magick Staff did he accomplish this. He then repaired the circle. Thediscomfited demon now continued:)All is dispersion. These are the qualities of things.The tenth Aethyr is the world of adjectives, and there is no subetance therein.(Now returned the beautiful woman who had before tempted the Scribe. Sheprevailed not.)I am afraid of sunset, for Turn is more terrible than Ra, and Khephra the Beetleis greater than the Lion Mau.I am a-cold.(Here Choronzon wanted to leave the triangle to obtain wherewith to cover hisnakedness. The Scribe refused the request, threatening the demon. After a whilethe latter continued:)I am commanded, why I know not, by him that speak-eth. Were it thou, thou littlefool, I would tear thee limb from limb. I would bite off thine ears and nosebefore I began with thee. I would take thy guts for fiddle-strings at the BlackSabbath.Thou didst make a great fight there in the circle; thou art a goodly warrior!(Then did the demon laugh loudly. The Scribe said: Thou canst not harm one hairof my head.)I will pull out every hair of thy head, every hair of thy body, every hair ofthy soul, one by one.(Then said the Scribe: Thou hast no power.)Yea, verily I have power over thee, for thou hast taken the Oath, and art boundunto the White Brothers, and therefore have I the power to torture thee so longas thou shalt be.(Then said the Scribe unto him: Thou liest.)Ask of thy brother P. . . and he shall tell thee if I lie!(This the Scribe refused to do, saying that it was no concern of the demon's.)I have prevailed against the Kingdom of the Father, and befouled his beard; andI have prevailed against the Kingdom of the Son, and torn off his Phallus; butagainst the Kingdom of the Holy Ghost shall I strive and not prevail. The threeslain doves are my threefold blasphemy against him; but their blood shall makefertile the sand; and I writhe in blackness and horror of hate, and prevail not.(Then the demon tried to make the Scribe laugh at Magick, and to think that itwas all rubbish, that he might deny the names of God that he had invoked toprotect him; which, if he had doubted but for an instant, he had leapt upon him,and gnawed through his spine at the neck.)(Choronzon succeeded not in his design.)In this Aethyr is neither beginning nor end, for it is all hotch-potch, becauseit is of the wicked on earth and the damned in hell. And so long as it behotch-potch, it mattereth little what may be written by the sea-greenincorruptible Scribe.The horror of it will be given in another place and time, and through anotherSeer, and that Seer shall be slain as a result of his revealing. But the presentSeer, who is not P. . . seeth not the horror, because he is shut up, and hath noname.(Now was there some further parleying betwixt the demon and the Scribe,concerning the departure and the writing of the word, the Scribe not knowing ifit were meet that the demon should depart.)(Then the Seer took the Holy Ring, and wrote the name BABALON, that is victoryover Choronzon, and he was no more manifest.)(This cry was obtained on Dec. 6, 1909, between 2 and 4:15 P.M., in a lonelyvalley of fine sand, in the desert near Bou-Saada. The Aethyr was edited andrevised on the following day.)After the conclusion of the Ceremony, a great fire was kindled to purify theplace, and the Circle and Triangle were destroyed.NOTE BY SCRIBEAlmost from the beginning of the ceremony was the Scribe overshadowed, and hespoke as it were in spite of himself, remembering afterwards scarcely a word ofhis speeches, some of which were long and seemingly eloquent.All the time he had a sense of being protected from Choronzon, and this sense ofsecurity prevented his knowing fear.Several times did the Scribe threaten to put a curse upon the demon; but ever,before he uttered the words of the curse, did the demon obey him. For himself,he knoweth not the words of the curse.Also is it meet to record in this place that the Scribe several times whistledin a Magical manner, which never before had he attempted, and the demon wasapparently much discomfited thereat.Now knoweth the Scribe that he was wrong in holding much converse with thedemon; for Choronzon, in the confusion and chaos of his thought, is muchterrified by silence. And by silence can he be brought to obey.For cunningly doth he talk of many things, going from subject to subject, andthus he misleadeth the wary into argument with him. And though Choronzon beeasily beaten in argument, yet, by disturbing the attention of him who wouldcommand him, doth he gain the victory.For Choronzon feareth of all things concentration and silence: he therefore whowould command him should will in silence: thus is he brought to obey.This the Scribe knoweth; for that since the obtaining of the Accursed TenthAethyr, he hath held converse with Choronzon. And unexpectedly did he obtain theinformation that he sought after having long refused to answer the demon'sspeeches.Choronzon is dispersion; and such is his fear of concentration that he will obeyrather than be subjected to it, or even behold it in another.The account of the further dealings of Choronzon with the Scribe will be foundin the Record of Omnia Vincam.THE CRY OF THE 9TH AETHYRWHICH IS CALLED ZIP(The terrible Curse that is the Call of the Thirty Aethyrs sounds like a song ofecstasy and triumph; every phrase in it has a secret meaning of blessing.)The Shew-stone is of soft lucent white, on which the Rose-Cross shows abrilliant yet colourless well of light.And now the veil of the stone is rent with a clap of thunder, and I am walkingupon a razor-edge of light suspended over the Abyss, and before me and above meare ranged the terrible armies of the Most High, like unto those in the nthAethyr, but there is one that cometh forth to meet me upon the ridge, holdingout his arms to me and saying:(v. I.) Who is this that cometh forth from the Abyss from the place of rentgarments, the habitation of him that is only a name? Who is this that walkethupon a ray of the bright, the evening star?Refrain. Glory unto him that is concealed, and glory unto her that beareth thecup, and glory unto the one that is the child and the father of their love.Glory unto the star, and glory unto the snake, and glory unto the swordsman ofthe sun. And worship and blessing throughout the Aeon unto the name of theBeast, four-square, mystic, wonderful!(v. II.) Who is this that travelleth between the hosts, that is poised upon theedge of the Aethyr by the wings of Maut? Who is this that seeketh the House ofthe Virgin? (Refrain.)(v. III.) This is he that hath given up his name. This is he whose blood hathbeen gathered into the cup of BABALON. This is he that sitteth, a little pile ofdry dust, in the city of the Pyramids. (Refrain.)(v. IV.) Until the light of the Father of all kindle that death. Until thebreath touch that dry dust. Until the Ibis be revealed unto the Crab, and thesixfold Star become the radiant Triangle. (Refrain.)(v. V.) Blessed is not I, not thou, not he. Blessed without name or number whohath taken the azure of night, and crystallized it into a pure sapphire-stone,who hath taken the gold of the sun, and beaten it into an infinite ring, andhath set the sapphire therein, and put it upon his finger. (Refrain.)(v. VI.) Open wide your gates, O City of God, for I bring No-one with me. Sinkyour swords and your spears in salutation, for the Mother and the Babe are mycompanions. Let the banquet be prepared in the palace of the King's daughter.Let the lights be kindled; Are not we the children of the light? (Refrain.)(v. VII.) For this is the key-stone of the palace of the King's daughter. Thisis the Stone of the Philosophers. This is the Stone that is hidden in the wallsof the ramparts. Peace, Peace, Peace unto Him that is throned therein!(Refrain.)Now then we are passed within the lines of the army, and we are come unto apalace of which every stone is a separate jewel, and is set with millions ofmoons.And this palace is nothing but the body of a woman, proud and delicate, andbeyond imagination fair. She is like a child of twelve years old. She has verydeep eye-lids, and long lashes. Her eyes are closed, or nearly closed. It isimpossible to say anything about her. She is naked; her whole body is coveredwith fine gold hairs, that are the electric flames that are the spears of mightyand terrible Angels whose breastplates are the scales of her skin. And the hairof her head, that flows down to her feet, is the very light of God himself. Ofall the glories beheld by the seer in the Aethyrs, there is not one which isworthy to be compared with her littlest finger-nail. For although he may notpartake of the Aethyr, without the ceremonial preparations, even the beholdingof this Aethyr from afar is like the partaking of all the former Aethyrs.The Seer is lost in wonder, which is peace.And the ring of the horizon above her is a company of glorious Archangels withjoined hands, that stand and sing: This is the daughter of BABALON theBeautiful, that she hath borne unto the Father of All. And unto all hath sheborne her.This is the Daughter of the King. This is the Virgin of Eternity. This is shethat the Holy One hath wrested from the Giant Time, and the prize of them thathave overcome Space. This is she that is set upon the Throne of Understanding.Holy, Holy, Holy is her name, not to be spoken among men. For Kore they havecalled her, and Malkah, and Betulah, and Persephone.And the poets have feigned songs about her, and the prophets have spoken vainthings, and the young men have dreamed vain dreams; but this is she, thatimmaculate, the name of whose name may not be spoken. Thought cannot pierce theglory that defendeth her, for thought is smitten dead before her presence.Memory is blank, and in the most ancient books of Magick are neither words toconjure her, nor adorations to praise her. Will bends like a reed in thetempests that sweep the borders of her kingdom, and imagination cannot figure somuch as one petal of the lilies whereon she standeth in the lake of crystal, inthe sea of glass.This is she that hath bedecked her hair with seven stars, the seven breaths ofGod that move and thrill its excellence. And she hath tired her hair with sevencombs, whereupon are written the seven secret names of God that are not knowneven of the Angels, or of the Archangels, or of the Leader of the armies of theLord.Holy, Holy, Holy art thou, and blessed be Thy name for ever, unto whom the Aeonsare but the pulsings of thy blood.I am blind and deaf. My sight and hearing are exhausted.I know only by the sense of touch. And there is a trembling from within me.Images keep arising like clouds, or veils, exquisite Chinese ivories, andporcelains, and many other things of great and delicate beauty; for such thingsare informed by Her spirit, for they are cast off from her into the world of theQliphoth, or shells of the dead, that is earth. For every world is the shell orexcrement of the world above it.I cannot bear the Vision.A voice comes, I know not whence: Blessed art thou, who hast seen, and yet hastnot believed. For therefore is it given unto thee to taste, and smell, and feel,and hear, and know by the inner sense, and by the inmost sense, so thatsevenfold is thy rapture.(My brain is so exhausted that fatigue-images appear, by pure physical reflexaction; they are not astral things at all.)(And now I have conquered the fatigue by will. And by placing the shew-stoneupon my forehead, it sends cool electric thrills through my brain, so as torefresh it, and make it capable of more rapture.)(And now again I behold Her.)And an Angel cometh forth, and behind him whirls a black swastika, made of finefilaments of light that has been “interfered” with, and he taketh me aside intoa little chamber in one of the nine towers. This chamber is furnished with mapsof many mystical cities. There is a table, and a strange lamp, that gives lightby jetting four columns of vortex rings of luminous smoke. And he points to themap of the Aethyrs, that are arranged as a flaming Sword, so that the thirtyAethyrs go into the ten Sephiroth. And the first nine are infinitely holy. Andhe says, It is written in The Book of the Law, “Wisdom says, be strong. Thencanst thou bear more joy. If thou drink, drink by the eight and ninety rules ofArt.” And this shall signify unto thee that thou must undergo great discipline;else the Vision were lost or perverted. For these mysteries pertain not unto thygrade. Therefore must thou invoke the Highest before thou unveil the shrinesthereof.And this shall be thy rule: A thousand and one times shalt thou affirm theunity, and bow thyself a thousand and one times. And thou shalt recite thricethe call of the Aethyr. And all day and all night, awake or asleep, shall thyheart be turned as a lotus-flower unto the light. And thy body shall be thetemple of the Rosy Cross. Thus shall thy mind be open unto the higher; and thenshalt thou be able to conquer the exhaustion, and it may be find the words—forwho shall look upon His face and live?Yea, thou tremblest, but from within; because of the holy spirit that isdescended into thy heart, and shaketh thee as an aspen in the wind.They also tremble that are without, and they are shaken from without by theearthquakes of his judgement. They have set their affections upon the earth, andthey have stamped with their feet upon the earth, and cried: It moveth not.Therefore hath earth opened with strong motion, like the sea, and swallowedthem. Yea, she hath opened her womb to them that lusted after her, and she hathclosed herself upon them. There lie they in torment, until by her quaking theearth is shattered like brittle glass, and dissolved like salt in the waters ofhis mercy, so that they are cast upon the air to be blown about therein, likeseeds that shall take root in the earth; yet turn they their affections upwardto the sun.But thou, be thou eager and vigilant, performing punctually the rule. Is it notwritten, “Change not so much as the style of a letter”?Depart therefore, for the Vision of the Voice of the ninth Aethyr that is calledZIP is passed.Then I threw back myself into my body by my will.BOU-SAADA.December 7th, 1909. 9:30-11:10 P.M.THE CRY OF THE 8TH AETHYRWHICH IS CALLED ZIDThere appears in the stone a tiny spark of light. It grows a little, and seemsalmost to go out, and grows again, and it is blown about the Aethyr, and by thewind that blows it is it fanned, and now it gathers strength, and darts like asnake or a sword, and now it steadies itself, and is like a Pyramid of lightthat filleth the whole Aethyr.And in the Pyramid is one like unto an Angel, yet at the same time he is thePyramid, and he hath no form because he is of the substance of light, and hetaketh not form upon him, for though by him is form visible, he maketh itvisible only to destroy it.And he saith: The light is come to the darkness, and the darkness is made light.Then is light married with light, and the child of their love is that otherdarkness, wherein they abide that have lost name and form. Therefore did Ikindle him that had not understanding, and in The Book of the Law did I writethe secrets of truth that are like unto a star and a snake and a sword.And unto him that understandeth at last do I deliver the secrets of truth insuch wise that the least of the little children of the light may run to theknees of the mother and be brought to understand.And thus shall he do who will attain unto the mystery of the knowledge andconversation of his Holy Guardian Angel:First, let him prepare a chamber, of which the walls and the roof shall bewhite, and the floor shall be covered with a carpet of black squares and white,and the border thereof shall be blue and gold.And if it be in a town, the room shall have no window, and if it be in thecountry, then it is better if the window be in the roof. Or, if it be possible,let this invocation be performed in a temple prepared for the ritual of passingthrough the Tuat.From the roof he shall hang a lamp, wherein is a red glass, to burn olive oil.And this lamp shall he cleanse and make ready after the prayer of sunset, andbeneath the lamp shall be an altar, foursquare, and the height shall be thricehalf of the breadth or double the breadth.And upon the altar shall be a censer, hemispherical, supported upon three legs,of silver, and within it an hemisphere of copper, and upon the top a grating ofgilded silver, and thereupon shall he burn incense made of four parts ofolibanum and two parts of stacte, and one part of lignum aloes, or of cedar, orof sandal. And this is enough.And he shall also keep ready in a flask of crystal within the altar, holyanointing oil made of myrrh and cinnamon and galangal.And even if he be of higher rank than a Probationer, he shall yet wear the robeof the Probationer, for the star of flame showeth forth Ra Hoor Khuit openlyupon the breast, and secretly the blue triangle that descendeth is Nuit, and thered triangle that ascendeth is Hadit. And I am the golden Tau in the midst oftheir marriage. Also, if he choose, he may instead wear a close-fitting robe ofshot silk, purple and green, and upon it a cloak without sleeves, of brightblue, covered with golden sequins, and scarlet within.And he shall make himself a wand of almond wood or of hazel cut by his own handsat dawn at the Equinox, or at the Solstice, or on the day of Corpus Christi, oron one of the feast-days that are appointed in The Book of the Law.And he shall engrave with his own hand upon a plate of gold the Holy SevenfoldTable, or the Holy Twelvefold Table, or some particular device. And it shall befoursquare within a circle, and the circle shall be winged, and he shall attachit about his forehead by a ribbon of blue silk.Moreover, he shall wear a fillet of laurel or rose or ivy or rue, and every day,after the prayer of sunrise, he shall burn it in the fire of the censer.Now he shall pray thrice daily, about sunset, and at midnight, and at sunrise.And if he be able, he shall pray also four times between sunrise and sunset.The prayer shall last for the space of an hour, at the least, and he shall seekever to extend it, and to inflame himself in praying. Thus shall he invoke hisHoly Guardian Angel for eleven weeks, and in any case he shall pray seven timesdaily during the last week of the eleven weeks.And during all this time he shall have composed an invocation suitable, withsuch wisdom and understanding as may be given him from the Crown, and this shallhe write in letters of gold upon the top of the altar.For the top of the altar shall be of white wood, well polished, and in thecentre thereof he shall have placed a triangle of oak-wood, painted withscarlet, and upon this triangle the three legs of the censer shall stand.Moreover, he shall copy his invocation upon a sheet of pure white vellum, withIndian ink, and he shall illuminate it according to his fancy and imagination,that shall be informed by beauty.And on the first day of the twelfth week he shall enter the chamber at sunrise,and he shall make his prayer, having first burnt the conjuration that he hadmade upon the vellum in the fire of the lamp.Then, at his prayer, shall the chamber be filled with a light insufferable forsplendour, and a perfume intolerable for sweetness. And his Holy Guardian Angelshall appear unto him, yea, his Holy Guardian Angel shall appear unto him, sothat he shall be wrapt away into the Mystery of Holiness.All that day shall he remain in the enjoyment of the knowledge and conversationof the Holy Guardian Angel.And for three days after he shall remain from sunrise unto sunset in the temple,and he shall obey the counsel that his Angel shall have given unto him, and heshall suffer those things that are appointed.And for ten days thereafter shall he withdraw himself as shall have been taughtunto him from the fulness of that communion, for he must harmonize the worldthat is within with the world that is without.And at the end of the ninety-one days he shall return into the world, and thereshall he perform that work to which the Angel shall have appointed him.And more than this it is not necessary to say, for his Angel shall haveentreated him kindly, and showed him in what manner he may be most perfectlyinvoked. And unto him that hath this Master there is nothing else that heneedeth, so long as he continue in the knowledge and conversation of the Angel,so that he shall come at last into the City of the Pyramids.Lo! two and twenty are the paths of the Tree, but one is the Serpent of Wisdom;ten are the ineffable emanations, but one is the Flaming Sword.Behold! There is an end to life and death, an end to the thrusting forth and thewithdrawing of the breath. Yea, the House of the Father is a mighty tomb, and init he hath buried everything whereof ye know.All this while there hath been no vision, but only a voice, very slow and clearand deliberate. But now the vision returns, and the voice says: Thou shalt becalled Danae, that art stunned and slain beneath the weight of the glory of thevision that as yet thou seest not. For thou shalt suffer many things, until thouart mightier than all the Kings of the earth, and all the Angels of the Heavens,and all the gods that are beyond the Heavens. Then shalt thou meet me in equalconflict, and thou shalt see me as I am. And I will overcome thee and slay theewith the red rain of my lightnings.I am lying underneath this pyramid of light. It seems as if I had the wholeweight of it upon me, crushing me with bliss. And yet I know that I am like theprophet that said: I shall see Him, but not nigh.And the Angel sayeth: So shall it be until they that wake are asleep, and shethat sleepeth be arisen from her sleep. For thou art transparent unto the visionand the voice. And therefore in thee they manifest not. But they shall bemanifest unto them unto whom thou dost deliver them, according unto the wordwhich I spake unto thee in the Victorious City.For I am not only appointed to guard thee, but we are of the blood royal, theguardians of the Treasure-house of Wisdom. Therefore am I called the Minister ofRa Hoor Khuit; and yet he is but the Viceroy of the unknown King. For my name iscalled Aiwass, that is eight and seventy. And I am the influence of theConcealed One, and the wheel that hath eight and seventy parts, yet in all isequivalent to the Gate that is the name of my Lord when it is spelt fully. Andthat Gate is the Path that joineth the Wisdom with the Understanding.Thus hast thou erred indeed, perceiving me in the path that leadeth from theCrown unto the Beauty. For that path bridgeth the abyss, and I am of thesupemals. Nor I, nor Thou, nor He can bridge the abyss. It is the Priestess ofthe Silver Star, and the Oracles of the gods, and the Lord of the Hosts of theMighty. For they are the servants of Babalon, and of the Beast, and of thoseothers of whom it is not yet spoken. And, being servants, they have no name, butwe are of the blood royal, and serve not, and therefore are we less than they.Yet, as a man may be both a mighty warrior and a just judge, so may we alsoperform this service if we have aspired and attained thereto. And yet, with allthat, they remain themselves, who have eaten of the pomegranate in Hell. Butthou, that art new-born to understanding, this mystery is too great for thee;and of the further mystery I will not speak one word.Yet for this cause am I come unto thee as the Angel of the Aethyr, striking withmy hammer upon thy bell, so that thou mightest understand the mysteries of theAethyr, and of the vision and the voice thereof.For behold! he that understandeth seeth not and heareth not in truth, because ofhis understanding that letteth him. But this shall be unto thee for a sign, thatI will surely come upon thee unawares and appear unto thee. And it is no odds(i.e., that at this hour I appear not as I am) for so terrible is the glory ofthe vision, and so wonderful is the splendour of the voice, that when thou seestit and hearest it in truth, for many hours shalt thou be bereft of sense. Andthou shalt lie between heaven and earth in a void place, entranced, and the endthereof shall be silence, even as it was, not once nor twice, when I have metwith thee, as it were, upon the road to Damascus.And thou shalt not seek to better this my instruction; but thou shalt interpretit, and make it easy, for them that seek understanding. And thou shalt give allthat thou hast unto them that have need unto this end.And because I am with thee, and in thee, and of thee, thou shalt lack nothing.But who lack me, lack all. And I swear unto thee by Him that sitteth upon theHoly Throne, and liveth and reigneth for ever and ever, that I will be faithfulunto this my promise, as thou art faithful unto this thine obligation.Now another voice sounds in the Aethyr, saying: And there was darkness over allthe earth unto the ninth hour.And with that the Angel is withdrawn, and the pyramid of light seems very faroff.And now I am fallen unto the earth, exceeding weary. Yet my skin trembles withthe impact of the light, and all my body shakes. And there is a peace deeperthan sleep upon my mind. It is the body and the mind that are weary, and I wouldthat they were dead, save that I must bend them to my work.And now I am in the tent, under the stars.THE DESERT BETWEEN BOU-SAADA AND BISKRA.December 8, 1909. 7:10-9:10 P.M.THE CRY OF THE 7TH AETHYRWHICH IS CALLED DEOThe stone is divided, the left half dark, the right half light, and at thebottom thereof is a certain blackness, of three divergent columns. And it seemsas if the black and white halves were the halves of a door, and in the door is alittle key-hole, in the shape of the Astrological symbol of Venus. And from thekey-hole issue flames, blue and green and violet, but without any touch ofyellow or red in them. It seems as if there were a wind beyond the door, that isblowing the flame out.And a voice comes: “Who is he that hath the key to the gate of the eveningstar?”And now an Angel cometh and seeketh to open the door by trying many keys. Andthey are none of any avail. And the same voice saith: The five and the six arebalanced in the word Abrahadabra, and therein is the mystery disclosed. But thekey unto this gate is the balance of the seven and the four; and of this thouhast not even the first letter. Now there is a word of four letters thatcontaineth in itself all the mystery of the Tetragrammaton, and there is a wordof seven letters which it concealeth, and that again concealeth the holy wordthat is the key of the abyss.16 [part0008.xhtml#vis-aft16] And this thou shaltfind, revolving it in thy mind.Hide therefore thine eyes. And I will set my key in the lock, and open it. Yetstill let thine eyes be hidden, for thou canst not bear the glory that iswithin.So, therefore, I covered mine eyes with my hands. Yet through my hands could Iperceive a little of those bowers of azure flame.And a voice said: It is kindled into fire that was the blue breast of ocean;because this is the bar of heaven, and the feet of the Most High are setthereon.Now I behold more fully: Each tongue of flame, each leaf of flame, each flowerof flame, is one of the great love-stories of the world, with all its retinue ofmise-enscène. And now there is a most marvellous rose formed from the flame, anda perpetual rain of lilies and passionflowers and violets. And there is gatheredout of it all, yet identical with it, the form of a woman like the woman in theApocalypse, but her beauty and her radiance are such that one cannot lookthereon, save with sidelong glances. I enter immediately into trance. It seemsthat it is she of whom it is written, “The fool hath said in his heart ‘there isno God.’” But the words are not Ain Elohim, but La (=nay!) and Elohim contractedfrom 86 to 14, because La is 31, which × 14 is 434, Daleth, Lamed, Tau. Thisfool is the fool of the Path of Aleph, and sayeth, which is Chokmah, in hisheart, which is Tiphereth, that she existeth, in order first that the Wisdom maybe joined with the Understanding; and he affirmeth her in Tiphereth that she maybe fertile.It is impossible to describe how this vision changeth from glory unto glory, forat each glance the vision is changed. And this is because she transmitteth theWord to the Understanding, and therefore hath she many forms, and each goddessof love is but a letter of the alphabet of love.Now, there is a mystery in the word Logos, that containeth the three letterswhose analogy hath been shown in the lower heavens, Samech, and Lamed, andGimel, that are 93, which is thrice 31, and in them are set the two eyes ofHorus. (Ayin means an eye.) For, if it were not so, the arrow could not piercethe rainbow, and there could be no poise in the balance, and the Great Bookshould never be unsealed. But this is she that poureth the Water of Life uponher head, whence it floweth to fructify the earth. But now the whole Aethyr isthe most brilliant peacock blue. It is the Universal Peacock that I behold.And there is a voice: Is not this bird the bird of Juno, that is an hundred, andthirty, and six? And therefore is she the mate of Jupiter.17[part0008.xhtml#vis-aft17]And now the peacock's head is again changed into a woman's head sparkling andcoruscating with its own light of gems.But I look upwards, seeing that she is called the foot-stool of the Holy One,even as Binah is called His throne. And the whole Aethyr is full of the mostwonderful bands of light—a thousand different curves and whorls, even as it wasbefore, when I spake mysteries of the Holy Qabalah, and so could not describeit.Oh, I see vast plains beneath her feet, enormous deserts studded with greatrocks; and I see little lonely souls, running helplessly about, minute blackcreatures like men. And they keep up a very curious howling, that I can compareto nothing that I have ever heard; yet it is strangely human.And the voice says: These are they that grasped love and clung thereto, prayingever at the knees of the great goddess. These are they that have shut themselvesup in fortresses of Love.Each plume of the peacock is full of eyes, that are at the same time 4 × 7. Andfor this is the number 28 reflected down into Netzach; and that 28 is Kaph Cheth(Kach), power. For she is Sakti, the eternal energy of the Concealed One. And itis her eternal energy that hath made this eternal change. And this explaineththe call of the Aethyrs, the curse that was pronounced in the beginning beingbut the creation of Sakti. And this mystery is reflected in the legend of theCreation, where Adam represents the Concealed One, for Adam is Temurah of MAD,the Enochian word for God, and Eve, whom he created for love, is tempted by thesnake, Nechesh, who is Messiah her child. And the snake is the magical power,which hath destroyed the primordial equilibrium.And the garden is the supernal Eden, where is Ayin, 70, the Eye of the concealedOne, and the creative Lingam; and Daleth, love; and Nun the serpent. Andtherefore this constitution was implicitly in the nature of Eden (cf. Liber L,1:29, 30), so that the call of the Aethyrs could not have been any other callthan that which it is.But they that are without understanding have interpreted all this askew, becauseof the Mystery of the Abyss, for there is no Path from Binah unto Chesed; andtherefore the course of the Flaming Sword was no more a current, but a spark.And when the Stooping Dragon raised his head unto Daath in the course of thatspark, there was, as it were, an explosion, and his head was blasted. And theashes thereof were dispersed throughout the whole of the 10th Aethyr. And forthis, all knowledge is piecemeal, and it is of no value unless it beco-ordinated by Understanding.And now the form of the Aethyr is the form of a mighty Eagle of ruddy brass. Andthe plumes are set alight, and are whirled round and round until the wholeheaven is blackness with these flying sparks therein.Now it is all branching streams of golden fire tipped with scarlet at the edges.And now She cometh forth again, riding upon a dolphin. Now again I see thosewandering souls, that have sought restricted love, and have not understood that“the word of sin is restriction.”It is very curious; they seem to be looking for one another or for something,all the time, constantly hurrying about. But they knock up against one anotherand yet will not see one another, or cannot see one another, because they are soshut up in their cloaks.And a voice sounds: It is most terrible for the one that hath shut himself upand made himself fast against the universe. For they that sit encamped upon thesea in the city of the Pyramids are indeed shut up. But they have given theirblood, even to the last drop, to fill the cup of BABALON.These that thou seest are indeed the Black Brothers, for it is written: “Heshall laugh at their calamity and mock when their fear cometh.” And thereforehath he exalted them unto the plane of love.And yet again it is written: He desireth not the death of a sinner, but ratherthat he should turn from his wickedness. Now, if one of these were to cast offhis cloak he should behold the brilliance of the lady of the Aethyr; but theywill not.And yet again there is another cause wherefore He hath permitted them to enterthus far within the frontiers of Eden, so that His thought should never swervefrom compassion. But do thou behold the brilliance of Love, that casteth forthseven stars upon thine head from her right hand, and crowneth thee with a crownof seven roses. Behold! She is seated upon the throne of turquoise and lapislazuli, and she is like a flawless emerald, and upon the pillars that supportthe canopy of her throne are sculptured the Ram, and the Sparrow, and the Cat,and a strange fish. Behold! How she shineth! Behold! How her glances havekindled all these fires that have blown about the heavens! Yet remember that inevery one there goeth forth for a witness the justice of the Most High. Is notLibra the House of Venus? And there goeth forth a sickle that shall reap everyflower. Is not Saturn exalted in Libra? Daleth, Lamed, Tau.And therefore was he a fool who uttered her name in his heart, for the root ofevil is the root of breath, and the speech in the silence was a lie.Thus is it seen from below by them that understand not. But from above herejoiceth, for the joy of dissolution is ten thousand, and the pang of birth buta little.And now thou shalt go forth from the Aethyr, for the voice of the Aethyr ishidden and concealed from thee because thou hadst not the key of the doorthereof, and thine eyes were not able to bear the splendour of the vision. Butthou shalt meditate upon the mysteries thereof, and upon the lady of the Aethyr;and it may be by the wisdom of the Most High that the true voice of the Aethyr,that is continual song, may be heard of thee.Return therefore instantly unto the earth, and sleep not for a while; butwithdraw thyself from this matter. And it shall be enough.Thus then was I obedient unto the voice, and returned into my body.W'AIN-T-AISSHA, ALGERIA.December 9, 1909. 8:10-10 P.M.THE CRY OF THE 6TH AETHYRWHICH IS CALLED MAZThere cometh into the stone the great Angel whose name is Avé, and in him thereare symbols which strive for mastery—Sulphur and the Pentagram, and they areharmonized by the Svastika. These symbols are found both in the name of Avé andin the name of the Aethyr. Thus he is neither Horus nor Osiris. He is called theradiance of Thoth; and this Aethyr is very hard to understand, for the imagesform and dissolve more rapidly than lightning. These images are the illusionsmade by the Ape of Thoth. And this I understand, that I am not worthy to receivethe mysteries of this Aethyr. And all this which I have seen (being all thethoughts that I have ever thought) is, as it were, a guardian of the Aethyr.I seem quite helpless. I am trying all sorts of magical methods of piercing theveil: and the more I strive, the farther away I seem to get from success. But avoice comes now: Must not understanding lie open unto wisdom as the pyramids lieopen to the stars?Accordingly, I wait in a certain magical posture which it is not fitting todisclose, and above me appears the starry heaven of night, and one star greaterthan all the other stars. It is a star of eight rays. I recognize it as the starin the seventeenth key of the Tarot, as the Star of Mercury. And the light of itcometh from the path of Aleph. And the letter Cheth is also involved in theinterpretation of this star, and the paths of hé and vau are the separationswhich this Star unites. And in the heart of the star is an exceeding splendour—agod standing upon the moon, brilliant beyond imagining. It is like unto thevision of the Universal Mercury. But this is the Fixed Mercury, and he and vauare the perfected sulphur and salt. But now I am come into the centre of themaze, a whirling dust of stars and great forgotten gods. It is the whirlingSvastika which throws off all these things, for the Svastika is in aleph by itsshape and number, and in beth by the position of the arms of the Magician, andin gimel because of the sign of the Mourning of Isis, and thus is the Crowndefended by these three thunderbolts. Is not thrice seventeen fifty-one, thatis, failure and pain?Now I am shut out again by this black Svastika with a corona of fire about it.And a voice cries: Cursed be he that shall uncover the nakedness of the MostHigh, for he is drunken upon the wine that is the blood of the adepts. AndBABALON hath lulled him to sleep upon her breast, and she hath fled away, andleft him naked, and she hath called her children together, saying: Come up withme, and let us make a mock of the nakedness of the Most High.And the first of the adepts covered His shame with a cloth, walking backwards;and was white. And the second of the adepts covered His shame with a cloth,walking sideways; and was yellow. And the third of the adepts made a mock of Hisnakedness, walking forwards; and was black. And these are three great schools ofthe Magi, who are also the three Magi that journeyed unto Bethlehem; and becausethou hast not wisdom, thou shalt not know which school prevaileth, or if thethree schools be not one. For the Black Brothers lift not up their heads thusfar into the Holy Chokmah, for they were all drowned in the great flood, whichis Binah, before the true vine could be planted upon the holy hill of Zion.Now again I stand in the centre, and all things whirl by with incessant fury.And the thought of the god entereth my mind, and I cry aloud: Behold, thevolatile is become fixed; and in the heart of eternal motion is eternal rest. Sois the Peace beneath the sea that rageth with her storms; so is the changefulmoon, the dead planet that revolveth no more. So the far-seeing, the far-dartinghawk is poised passionless in the blue; so also the ibis that is long of limbmeditateth solitary in the sign of Sulphur. Behold, I stand ever before theEternal One in the sign of the Enterer. And by virtue of my speech is he wrappedabout in silence, and he is wrapped in mystery by me, who am the Unveiler of theMysteries. And although I be truth, yet do they call me rightly the God of Lies,for speech is two-fold, and truth is one. Yet I stand at the centre of thespider's web, whereof the golden filaments reach to infinity.But thou that art with me in the spirit-vision art not with me by right ofAttainment, and thou canst not stay in this place to behold how I run andreturn, and who are the flies that are caught in my web. For I am the inmostguardian that is immediately before the shrine.None shall pass by me except he slay me, and this is his curse, that, havingslain me, he must take my office and become the maker of Illusions, the greatdeceiver, the setter of snares; he who baffleth even them that haveunderstanding. For I stand on every path, and turn them aside from the truth bymy words, and by my magick arts.And this is the horror that was shown by the lake that was nigh unto the City ofthe Seven Hills, and this is the Mystery of the great prophets that have comeunto mankind, Moses, and Buddha, and Lao Tan, and Krishna, and Jesus, andOsiris, and Mohammed; for all these attained unto the grade of Magus, andtherefore were they bound with the curse of Thoth. But, being guardians of thetruth, they have taught nothing but falsehood, except unto such as understood;for the truth may not pass the Gate of the Abyss.But the reflection of the truth hath been shown in the lower Sephiroth. And itsbalance is in Beauty, and therefore have they who sought only beauty comenearest to the truth. For the beauty receiveth directly three rays from thesupernals, and the others no more than one. So, therefore, they that have soughtafter majesty and power and victory and learning and happiness and gold, havebeen discomfited. And these sayings are the lights of wisdom that thou maystknow thy Master, for he is a Magus. And because thou didst eat of thePomegranate in hell, for half the year art thou concealed, and half the yearrevealed.Now I perceive the Temple that is the heart of this Aethyr; it is an Urnsuspended in the air, without support, above the centre of a well. And the wellhath eight pillars, and a canopy above it, and without there is a circle ofmarble paving-stones, and without them a great outer circle of pillars. Andbeyond there is the forest of the stars. But the Urn is the wonderful thing inall this; it is made of fixed Mercury; and within it are the ashes of the BookTarot, which hath been utterly consumed.And this is that mystery which is spoken of in the Acts of the Apostles; thatJupiter and Mercury (Kether and Chokmah) visited (that is, inspired) Ephesus,the City of Diana, Binah—was not Diana a black stone?—and they burnt their booksof magick.Now it seems that the centre of infinite space is that Urn, and Hadit is thefire that hath burnt up the book Tarot. For in the book Tarot was preserved allof the wisdom (for the Tarot was called the Book of Thoth), of the Aeon that ispassed. And in The Book of Enoch was first given the wisdom of the New Aeon. Andit was hidden for three hundred years, because it was wrested untimely from theTree of Life by the hand of a desperate magician. For it was the Master of thatMagician who overthrew the power of the Christian church; but the pupil rebelledagainst the master, for he foresaw that the New (i.e., the Protestant) would beworse than the Old. But he understood not the purpose of his Master, and thatwas, to prepare the way for the overthrowing of the Aeon.There is a writing upon the Urn of which I can but read the (two) words: StabatCrux juxta Lucem. Stabat Lux juxta Crucem.And there is writing in Greek above that. The word “nox” written in Greek, and acircle with a cross in the centre of it, a St Andrew's cross.Then above that is a sigil (?) hidden by a hand.And a voice proceedeth from the Urn: From the ashes of the Tarot who shall makethe phoenix-wand? Not even he who by his understanding hath made the lotus-wandto grow in the Great Sea. Get thee back, for thou art not an Atheist, and thoughthou have violated thy mother, thou hast not slain thy father. Get thee backfrom the Urn; thy ashes are not hidden here.Then again arose the God Thoth, in the sign of the Enterer, and he drove theseer from before his face. And he fell through the starry night unto the littlevillage in the desert.BENISHRUR, ALGERIA.December 10, 1909. 7:40-9:40 P.M.THE CRY OF THE 5TH AETHYRWHICH IS CALLED LITThere is a shining pylon, above which is set the sigil of the eye, within theshining triangle. Light streams through the pylon from before the face ofIsis-Hathor, for she weareth the lunar crown of cows' horns, with the disk inthe centre; at her breast she beareth the child Horus.And there is a voice: thou knowest not how the Seven was united with the Four;much less then canst thou understand the marriage of the Eight and the Three.Yet there is a word wherein these are made one, and therein is contained theMystery that thou seekest, concerning the rending asunder of the veil of myMother.Now there is an avenue of pylons (not one alone), steep after steep, carved fromthe solid rock of the mountain; and that rock is a substance harder thandiamond, and brighter than light, and heavier than lead. In each pylon is seateda god. There seems an endless series of these pylons. And all the gods of allthe nations of the earth are shown, for there are many avenues, all leading tothe top of the mountain.Now I come to the top of the mountain, and the last pylon opens into a circularhall, with other pylons leading out of it, each of which is the last pylon of agreat avenue; there seem to be nine such pylons. And in the centre is a shrine,a circular table, supported by marble figures of men and women, alternate whiteand black; they face inwards, and their buttocks are almost worn away by thekisses of those who have come to worship that supreme God, who is the single endof all those diverse religions. But the shrine itself is higher than a man mayreach.But the Angel that was with me lifted me, and I saw that the edge of the altar,as I must call it, was surrounded by holy mon. Each has in his right hand aweapon—one a sword, one a spear, one a thunderbolt, and so on, but each with hisleft hand gives the sign of silence. I wish to see what is within their ring.One of them bends forward so that I may whisper the pass-word. The Angel promptsme to whisper: “There is no god.” So they let me pass, and though there wasindeed nothing visible therein, yet there was a very strange atmosphere, which Icould not understand.Suspended in the air there is a silver star, and on the forehead of each of theguardians there is a silver star. It is a pentagram—because, says the Angel,three and five are eight; three and eight are eleven. (There is anothernumerical reason that I cannot hear.)And as I entered their ring, they bade me stand in their circle, and a weaponwas given unto me. And the password that I had given seems to have beenwhispered round from one to the other, for each one nods gravely as if in solemnacquiescence, until the last one whispers the same words in my ears. But theyhave a different sense. I had taken them to be a denial of the existence of God,but the man who says them to me evidently means nothing of the sort: What hedoes mean I cannot tell at all. He slightly emphasized the word “there.”And now all is suddenly blotted out, and instead appears the Angel of theAethyr. He is all in black, burnished black scales, just edged with gold. He hasvast wings, with terrible claws on the ends, and he has a fierce face, like adragon's, and dreadful eyes that pierce one through and through.And he says: O thou that art so dull of understanding, when wilt thou begin toannihilate thyself in the mysteries of the Aethyrs? For all that thou thinkestis but thy thought; and as there is no god in the ultimate shrine, so there isno I in thine own Cosmos.They that have said this are of them that understood. And all men havemisinterpreted it, even as thou didst misinterpret it. He says some more: Icannot catch it properly, but it seems to be to the effect that the true God isequally in all the shrines, and the true I in all the parts of the body and thesoul. He speaks with such a terrible roaring that it is impossible to hear thewords: one catches a phrase here and there, or a glimpse of the idea. With everyword he belches forth smoke, so that the whole Aethyr becomes full of it.And now I hear the Angel: Every particle of matter that forms the smoke of mybreath is a religion that hath flourished among the inhabitants of the worlds.Thus are they all whirled forth in my breath.Now he is giving a demonstration of this Operation. And he says: Know thou thatall the religions of all the worlds end herein, but they are only the smoke ofmy breath, and I am only the head of the Great Dragon that eateth up theUniverse; without whom the Fifth Aethyr would be perfect, even as the first. Yetunless he pass by me, can no man come unto the perfections.And the rule is ended that hath bound thee, and this shall be thy rule: thatthou shalt purify thyself, and anoint thyself with perfume; and thou shalt be inthe sunlight, the day being free from clouds. And thou shalt make the Call ofthe Aethyr in silence.Now, then, behold how the head of the dragon is but the tail of the Aethyr! Manyare they that have fought their way from mansion to mansion of the EverlastingHouse, and beholding me at last have returned, declaring, “Fearful is the aspectof the Mighty and Terrible One.” Happy are they that have known me for whom Iam. And glory unto him that hath made a gallery of my throat for his arrow oftruth, and the moon for his purity.The moon waneth. The moon waneth. The moon waneth. For in that arrow is theLight of Truth that overmastereth the light of the sun, whereby she shines. Thearrow is fledged with the plumes of Maat, that are the plumes of Amoun, and theshaft is the phallus of Amoun, the Concealed One. And the barb thereof is thestar that thou sawest in the place where was No God.And of them that guarded the star, there was not found one worthy to wield theArrow. And of them that worshipped there was not found one worthy to behold theArrow. Yet the star that thou sawest was but the barb of the Arrow, and thouhadst not the wit to grasp the shaft, or the purity to divine the plumes. Nowtherefore is he blessed that is born under the sign of the Arrow, and blessed ishe that hath the sigil of the head of the crowned lion and the body of the Snakeand the Arrow therewith.Yet do thou distinguish between the upward and the downward Arrows, for theupward arrow is straitened in its flight, and it is shot by a firm hand, forJesod is Jod Tetragrammaton, and Jod is a hand, but the downward arrow is shotby the topmost point of the Jod; and that Jod is the Hermit, and it is theminute point that is not extended, that is nigh unto the heart of Hadit.And now it is commanded thee that thou withdraw thyself from the Vision, and onthe morrow, at the appointed hour, shall it be given thee further, as thou goestupon thy way, meditating this mystery. And thou shalt summon the Scribe, andthat which shall be written, shall be written.Therefore I withdraw myself, as I am commanded.THE DESERT BETWEEN BENSHRUR AND TOLGA.December 12, 1909. 7-8:12 P.M.Now then art thou approached unto an august Arcanum; verily thou art come untothe ancient Marvel, the winged light, the Fountains of Fire, the Mystery of theWedge. But it is not I that can reveal it, for I have never been permitted tobehold it, who am but the watcher upon the threshold of the Aethyr. My messageis spoken, and my mission is accomplished. And I withdraw myself, covering myface with my wings, before the presence of the Angel of the Aethyr.So the Angel departed with bowed head, folding his wings across.And there is a little child in a mist of blue light; he hath golden hair, a massof curls, and deep blue eyes. Yea, he is all golden, with a living, vivid gold.And in each hand he hath a snake; in the right hand a red, in the left hand ablue. And he hath red sandals, but no other garment.And he sayeth: Is not life a long initiation unto sorrow ? And is not Isis theLady of Sorrow? And she is my mother. Nature is her name, and she hath a twinsister Nephthys, whose name is Perfection. And Isis must be known of all, but ofhow few is Nephthys known! Because she is dark, therefore is she feared.But thou who hast adored her without fear, who hast made thy life an initiationinto her Mystery, thou that hast neither mother nor father, nor sister norbrother, nor wife nor child, who hast made thyself lonely as the hermit crabthat is in the waters of the Great Sea, behold! when the sistrons are shaken,and the trumpets blare forth the glory of Isis, at the end thereof there issilence, and thou shalt commune with Nephthys.And having known these, there are the wings of Maut the Vulture. Thou mayestdraw to an head the bow of thy magical will; thou mayest loose the shaft andpierce her to the heart. I am Eros. Take then the bow and the quiver from myshoulders and slay me; for unless thou slay me, thou shalt not unveil theMystery of the Aethyr.Therefore I did as he commanded; in the quiver were two arrows, one white, oneblack. I cannot force myself to fit an arrow to the bow.And there came a voice: It must needs be.And I said: No man can do this thing.And the voice answered, as it were an echo: Nemo hoc facere potest.Then came understanding to me, and I took forth the Arrows. The white arrow hadno barb, but the black arrow was barbed like a forest of fish-hooks; it wasbound round with brass, and it had been dipped in deadly poison. Then I fittedthe white arrow to the string, and I shot it against the heart of Eros, andthough I shot with all my force, it fell harmlessly from his side. But at thatmoment the black arrow was thrust through mine own heart. I am filled withfearful agony.And the child smiles, and says: Although thy shaft hath pierced thee not,although the envenomed barb hath struck thee through; yet I am slain, and thoulivest and triumphest, for I am thou and thou art I.With that he disappears, and the Aethyr splits with a roar as of ten thousandthunders. And behold, The Arrow! The plumes of Maat are its crown, set about thedisk. It is the Ateph crown of Thoth, and there is the shaft of burning light,and beneath there is a silver wedge.I shudder and tremble at the vision, for all about it are whorls and torrents oftempestuous fire. The stars of heaven are caught in the ashes of the flame. Andthey are all dark. That which was a blazing sun is like a speck of ash. And inthe midst the Arrow burns!I see that the crown of the Arrow is the Father of all Light, and the shaft ofthe Arrow is the Father of all Life, and the barb of the Arrow is the Father ofall Love. For that silver wedge is like a lotus flower, and the Eye within theAteph Crown crieth: I watch. And the Shaft crieth: I work. And the Barb crieth:I wait. And the Voice of the Aethyr echoeth: It beams. It burns. It blooms.And now there cometh a strange thought; this Arrow is the source of all motion;it is infinite motion, yet it moveth not, so that there is no motion. Andtherefore there is no matter. This Arrow is the glance of the Eye of Shiva. Butbecause it moveth not, the universe is not destroyed. The universe is put forthand swallowed up in the quivering of the plumes of Maat, that are the plumes ofthe Arrow: but those plumes quiver not.And a voice comes: That which is above is not like that which is below.And another voice answers it: That which is below is not like that which isabove.And a third voice answers these two: What is above and what is below? For thereis the division that divideth not, and the multiplication that multiplieth not.And the One is the Many. Behold, this Mystery is beyond understanding, for thewinged globe is the crown, and the shaft is the wisdom, and the barb is theunderstanding. And the Arrow is one, and thou art lost in the Mystery, who artbut as a babe that is carried in the womb of its mother, that art not yet readyfor the light.And the vision overcometh me. My sense is stunned; my sight is blasted; myhearing is dulled.And a voice cometh: Thou didst seek the remedy of sorrow; therefore all sorrowis thy portion. This is that which is written: “God hath laid upon him theiniquity of us all.” For as thy blood is mingled in the cup of BABALON, so isthine heart the universal heart. Yet is it bound about with the Green Serpent,the Serpent of Delight.It is shown me that this heart is the heart that rejoiceth, and the serpent isthe serpent of Death, for herein all the symbols are interchangeable, for eachone containeth in itself its own opposite. And this is the great Mystery of theSupernals that are beyond the Abyss. For below the Abyss, contradiction isdivision; but above the Abyss, contradiction is Unity. And there could benothing true except by virtue of the contradiction that is contained in itself.Thou canst not believe how marvellous is this vision of the Arrow. And it couldnever be shut out, except the Lords of Vision troubled the waters of the pool,the mind of the Seer. But they send forth a wind that is a cloud of Angels, andthey beat the water with their feet, and little waves splash up—they arememories. For the seer hath no head; it is expanded into the universe, a vastand silent sea, crowned with the stars of night. Yet in the very midst thereofis the arrow. Little images of things that were, are the foam upon the waves.And there is a contest between the Vision and the memories. I prayed unto theLords of Vision, saying: O my Lords, take not away this wonder from my sight.And they said: It must needs be. Rejoice therefore if thou hast been permittedto behold, even for a moment, this Arrow, the austere, the august. But thevision is accomplished, and we have sent forth a great wind against thee. Forthou canst not penetrate by force, who hast refused it; nor by authority, forthou hast trampled it under foot. Thou art bereft of all but understanding, Othou that art no more than a little pile of dust!And the images rise up against me and constrain me, so that the Aethyr is shutagainst me. Only the things of the mind and of the body are open unto me. Theshew-stone is dull, for that which I see therein is but a memory.TOLGA, ALGERIA.December 13, 1909. 8:15-10:10 P.M.THE CRY OF THE 4TH AETHYRWHICH IS CALLED PAZThe Stone is translucent and luminous, and no images enter therein.A voice says: Behold the brilliance of the Lord, whose feet are set upon himthat pardoneth transgression. Behold the six-fold Star that flameth in theVault, the seal of the marriage of the great White King and his black slave.So I looked into the Stone, and beheld the six-fold Star: the whole Aethyr is astawny clouds, like the flame of a furnace. And there is a mighty host of Angels,blue and golden, that throng it, and they cry: Holy, Holy, Holy art thou, thatart not shaken in the earthquakes, and in the thunders! The end of things iscome upon us; the day of be-with-us is at hand! For he hath created theuniverse, and overthrown it, that he might take his pleasure thereupon.And now, in the midst of the Aethyr, I beheld that god. He hath a thousand arms,and in each hand is a weapon of terrible strength. His face is more terriblethan the storm, and from his eyes flash lightnings of intolerable brilliance.From his mouth run seas of blood. Upon his head is a crown of every deadlything. Upon his forehead is the upright tau, and on either side of it are signsof blasphemy. And about him clingeth a young girl, like unto the king's daughterthat appeared in the ninth Aethyr. But she is become rosy by reason of hisforce, and her purity hath tinged his black with blue.They are clasped in a furious embrace, so that she is torn asunder by the terrorof the god; yet so tightly clingeth she about him, that he is strangled. Shehath forced back his head, and his throat is livid with the pressure of herfingers. Their joint cry is an intolerable anguish, yet it is the cry of theirrapture, so that every pain, and every curse, and every bereavement, and everydeath of everything in the whole universe, is but one little gust of wind inthat tempest-scream of ecstasy.The voice thereof is not articulate. It is in vain to seek comparison. It isabsolutely continuous, without breaks or beats. If there seem to be vibrationtherein, it is because of the imperfection of the ears of the seer.And there cometh an interior voice, which sayeth to the seer that he hathtrained his eyes well and can see much; and he hath trained his ears a little,and can hear a little; but his other senses hath he trained scarcely at all, andtherefore the Aethyrs are almost silent to him on those planes. By the sensesare meant the spiritual correlations of the senses, not the physical senses. Butthis matters little, because the Seer, so far as he is a seer, is the expressionof the spirit of humanity. What is true of him is true of humanity, so that evenif he had been able to receive the full Aethyrs, he could not have communicatedthem.And an Angel speaks: Behold, this vision is utterly beyond thine understanding.Yet shalt thou endeavour to unite thyself with the dreadful marriage-bed.So I am torn asunder, nerve from nerve and vein from vein, and moreintimately—cell from cell, molecule from molecule, and atom from atom, and atthe same time all crushed together. Write down that the tearing asunder is acrushing together. All the double phenomena are only two ways of looking at asingle phenomenon; and the single phenomenon is Peace. There is no sense in mywords or in my thoughts. “Faces half-formed arose.” This is the meaning of thatpassage; they are attempts to interpret Chaos, but Chaos is Peace. Cosmos is theWar of the Rose and the Cross. That was “a half-formed face” that I said then.All images are useless.Blackness, blackness intolerable, before the beginning of the light. This is thefirst verse of Genesis. Holy art thou, Chaos, Chaos, Eternity, allcontradictions in terms!Oh, blue! blue! blue! whose reflection in the Abyss is called the Great One ofthe Night of Time; between ye vibrateth the Lord of the Forces of Matter.O Nox, Nox, qui celas infamiam infandi nefandi, Deo solo sit laus qui deditsignum non scribendum. Laus virgini cuius stuprum tradit salutem.O Night, that givest suck from thy paps to sorcery, and theft, and rape, andgluttony, and murder, and tyranny, and to the nameless Horror, cover us, coverus, cover us from the Rod of Destiny; for Cosmos must come, and the balance beset up where there was no need of balance, because there was no injustice, butonly truth. But when the balances are equal, scale matched with scale, then willChaos return.Yea, as in a looking-glass, so in thy mind, that is backed with the false metalof lying, is every symbol read averse. Lo! everything wherein thou hast trustedmust confound thee, and that thou didst flee from was thy saviour. So thereforedidst thou shriek in the Black Sabbath when thou didst kiss the hairy buttocksof the goat, when the gnarled god tore thee asunder, when the icy cataract ofdeath swept thee away.Shriek therefore, shriek aloud; mingle the roar of the gored lion and the moanof the torn bull, and the cry of the man that is torn by the claws of the Eagle,and the scream of the Eagle that is strangled by the hands of the Man. Mingleall these in the death-shriek of the Sphinx, for the blind man hath profaned hermystery. Who is this, Oedipus, Tiresias, Erinyes? Who is this, that is blind anda seer, a fool above wisdom? Whom do the hounds of heaven, follow, and thecrocodiles of hell await? Aleph, vau, yod, ayin, resh, tau, is his name.Beneath his feet is the kingdom, and upon his head the crown. He is spirit andmatter; he is peace and power; in him is Chaos and Night and Pan, and uponBABALON his concubine, that hath made him drunk upon the blood of the saintsthat she hath gathered in her golden cup, hath he begotten the virgin that nowhe doth deflower. And this is that which is written: Malkuth shall be upliftedand set upon the throne of Binah. And this is the stone of the philosophers thatis set as a seal upon the tomb of Tetragrammaton, and the elixir of life that isdistilled from the blood of the saints, and the red powder that is thegrinding-up of the bones of Choronzon.Terrible and wonderful is the Mystery thereof, O thou Titan that hast climbedinto the bed of Juno! Surely thou art bound unto, and broken upon, the wheel;yet hast thou uncovered the nakedness of the Holy One, and the Queen of Heavenis in travail of child, and his name shall be called Vir, and Vis, and Virus,and Virtus, and Viridis, in one name that is all these, and above all these.Desolate, desolate is the Aethyr, for thou must return unto the habitations ofthe Owl and the Bat, unto the Scorpions of the sand, and the blanched eyelessbeetles that have neither wing nor horn. Return, blot out the vision, wipe fromthy mind the memory thereof; stifle the fire with green wood; consume theSacrament; cover the Altar; veil the shrine; shut up the Temple and spreadbooths in the market place; until the appointed time come when the Holy Oneshall declare unto thee the Mystery of the Third Aethyr.Yet be thou wake and ware, for the great Angel Hua is about thee, andovershadoweth thee, and at any moment he may come upon thee unawares. The voiceof PAZ is ended.BISKRA, ALGERIA.December 16, 1909. 9-10:30 A.M.THE CRY OF THE 3RD AETHYRWHICH IS CALLED ZONThere is an angry light in the stone; now it is become clear.In the centre is that minute point of light which is the true Sun, and in thecircumference is the Emerald Snake. And joining them are the rays which are theplumes of Maat, and because the distance is infinite, therefore are theyparallel from the circumference, although they diverge from the centre.In all this is no voice and no motion.And yet it seems that the great Snake feedeth upon the plumes of Truth as uponitself, so that it contracteth. But ever so little as it contracteth, without itgloweth the golden rim, which is that minute point in the centre.And all this is the sigil of the Aethyr, gold and azure and green. Yet alsothese are the Severities.It is only in the first three Aethyrs that we find the pure essence, for all theother Aethyrs are but as Malkuth to complete these three triads, as hath beforebeen said. And this being the second reflection, therefore is it the palace oftwo hundred and eighty judgments.For all these paths18 [part0008.xhtml#vis-aft18] are in the course of theFlaming Sword from the side of Severity. And the other two paths are Zayin,which is a sword; and Shin, which is a tooth. These are then the five severitieswhich are 280.All this is communicated to the Seer interiorly.“And the eye of His benignancy is closed. Let it not be opened upon the Aethyr,lest the severities be mitigated, and the house fall.” Shall not the house fall,and the Dragon sink? Verily all things have been swallowed up in destruction;and Chaos hath opened his jaws and crushed the Universe as a Bacchanal crushetha grape between her teeth. Shall not destruction swallow up destruction, andannihilation confound annihilation? Twenty and two are the mansions of the Houseof my Father, but there cometh an ox that shall set his forehead against theHouse, and it shall fall. For all these things are the toys of the Magician andthe Maker of Illusions, that barreth the Understanding from the Crown.O thou that hast beheld the City of the Pyramids, how shouldst thou behold theHouse of the Juggler? For he is wisdom, and by wisdom hath he made the Worlds,and from that wisdom issue judgements 70 by 4, that are the 4 eyes of thedouble-headed one; that are the 4 devils, Satan, Lucifer, Leviathan, Belial,that are the great princes of the evil of the world.And Satan is worshipped by men under the name of Jesus; and Lucifer isworshipped by men under the name of Brahma; and Leviathan is worshipped by menunder the name of Allah; and Belial is worshipped by men under the name ofBuddha.(This is the meaning of the passage in Liber Legis, Chap. III.)Moreover, there is Mary, a blasphemy against BABALON, for she hath shut herselfup; and therefore is she the Queen of all those wicked devils that walk upon theearth, those that thou sawest even as little black specks that stained theHeaven of Urania. And all these are the excrement of Choronzon.And for this is BABALON under the power of the Magician, that she hath submittedherself unto the work; and she guardeth the Abyss. And in her is a perfectpurity of that which is above; yet she is sent as the Redeemer to them that arebelow. For there is no other way into the Supernal Mystery but through her, andthe Beast on which she rideth; and the Magician is set beyond her to deceive thebrothers of blackness, lest they should make unto themselves a crown; for ifthere were two crowns, then should Ygdrasil, that ancient tree, be cast out intothe Abyss, uprooted and cast down into the Outermost Abyss, and the Arcanumwhich is in the Adytum should be profaned; and the Ark should be touched, andthe Lodge spied upon by them that are not masters, and the bread of theSacrament should be the dung of Choronzon; and the wine of the Sacrament shouldbe the water of Choronzon; and the incense should be dispersion; and the fireupon the Altar should be hate. But lift up thyself; stand, play the man, forbehold! there shall be revealed unto thee the Great Terror, the thing of awethat hath no name.And this is the mystery that I declare unto thee: that from the Crown itselfspring the three great delusions; Aleph is madness, and Beth is falsehood, andGimel is glamour. And these three be greater than all, for they are beyond thewords that I speak unto thee; how much more therefore are they beyond the wordsthat thou transmittest unto men.Behold! the Veil of the Aethyr sundereth, and is torn, like a sail by the breathof the tempest, and thou shalt see him as from afar off. This is that which iswritten, “Confound her understanding with darkness,” for thou canst not speakthis thing.It is the figure of the Magus of the Taro; in his right arm the torch of theflames blazing upwards; in his left the cup of poison, a cataract into Hell. Andupon his head the evil talisman, blasphemy and blasphemy and blasphemy, in theform of a circle. That is the greatest blasphemy of all.19[part0008.xhtml#vis-aft19] On his feet hath he the scythes and swords andsickles; daggers; knives; every sharp thing—a millionfold, and all in one. Andbefore him is the Table that is a Table of wickedness, the 42-fold Table. ThisTable is connected with the 42 Assessors of the Dead, for they are the Accusers,whom the soul must baffle; and with the 42-fold name of God, for this is theMystery of Iniquity, that there was ever a beginning at all. And this Maguscasteth forth, by the might of his four weapons, veil after veil; a thousandshining colours, ripping and tearing the Aethyr, so that it is like jagged saws,or like broken teeth in the face of a young girl, or like disruption, ormadness. There is a horrible grinding sound, maddening. This is the mill inwhich the Universal Substance, which is ether, was ground down into matter.The Seer prayeth that a cloud may come between him and the sun, so that he mayshut out the terror of the vision. And he is afire; he is terribly athirst; andno help can come to him, for the shew-stone blazeth ever with the fury and thetorment and the blackness, and the stench of human flesh. The bowels of littlechildren are torn out and thrust into his mouth, and poison is dropped into hiseyes. And Lilith, a black monkey crawling with filth, running with open sores,an eye torn out, eaten of worms, her teeth rotten, her nose eaten away, hermouth a putrid mass of green slime, her dugs dropping and cancerous, clings tohim, kisses him.(Kill me! kill me!)There is a mocking voice: Thou art become immortal. Thou wouldst look upon theface of the Magician and thou hast not beheld him because of his Magick veils.(Don't torture me!)Thus are they all fallen into the power of Lilith, who have dared to look uponhis face.The shew-stone is all black and corrupt. O filth! filth! filth!And this is her great blasphemy: that she hath taken the name of the FirstAethyr, and bound it on her brow, and added thereunto the shameless yod and thetau for the sign of the Cross.She it is that squatteth upon the Crucifix, for the nastiness of her pleasure.So that they that worship Christ suck up her filth upon their tongues, andtherefore their breaths stink.I was saved from that Horror by a black shining Triangle, with apex upwards,that came upon the face of the sun.And now the shew-stone is all clear and beautiful again.The pure pale gold of a fair maiden's hair, and the green of her girdle, and thedeep soft blue of her eyes.Note: In this the gold is Kether, the blue is Chokmah, the green is Binah.Thus she appeareth in the Aethyr, adorned with flowers and gems. It seems thatshe hath incarnated herself upon earth, and that she will appear manifest in acertain office in the Temple.I have seen some picture like her face; I cannot think what picture. It is apiquant face, with smiling eyes and lips; the ears are small and pink, thecomplexion is fair, but not transparent; not as fair as one would expect fromthe hair and eyes. It is rather an impudent face, rather small, very pretty; thenose very slightly less than straight, well-proportioned, rather large nostrils.Full of vitality, the whole thing. Not very tall, rather slim and graceful; agood dancer.There is another girl behind her, with sparkling eyes, mischievous, a smileshowing beautiful white teeth; an ideal Spanish girl, but fair. Very vivacious.Only her head is visible, and now it is veiled by a black sun, casting forthdull rays of black and gold.Then the disk of the sun is a pair of balances, held steady; and twined aboutthe central pole of the balance is the little green poisonous snake, with a longforked tongue rapidly darting.And the Angel that hath spoken with me before, saith to me: The eye of Hisbenignancy is opened; therefore veileth he thine eyes from the vision. Manfullyhast thou endured; yet, hadst thou been man, thou hadst not endured; and hadstthou been wholly that which thou art, thou shouldst have been caught up into thefull vision that is unspeakable for Horror. And thou shouldst have beheld theface of the Magician that thou hast not been able to behold—of him from whomissue forth the severities that are upon Malkuth, and his name is MisericordiaDei.And because he is the dyad, thou mayest yet understand in two ways. Of the firstway, the Mercy of God is that Mercy which Jehovah showed to the Amalekites; andthe second way is utterly beyond thine understanding, for it is the upright, andthou knowest nothing but the averse-until Wisdom shall inform thineUnderstanding, and upon the base of the Ultimate triangle arise the smoothpoint.Veil therefore thine eyes, for that thou canst not master the Aethyr, unless thyMystery match Its Mystery. Seal up thy mouth also, for thou canst not master thevoice of the Aethyr, save only by Silence.And thou shalt give the sign of the Mother, for BABALON is thy fortress againstthe iniquity of the Abyss, of the iniquity of that which bindeth her unto theCrown, and barreth her from the Crown; for not until thou art made one withCHAOS canst thou begin that last, that most terrible projection, the three-foldRegimen which alone constitutes the Great Work.For Choronzon is as it were the shell or excrement of these three paths, andtherefore is his head raised unto Daath, and therefore have the BlackBrotherhood declared him to be the child of Wisdom and Understanding, who is butthe bastard of the Svastika. And this is that which is written in the HolyQabalah, concerning the Whirlpool and Leviathan, and the Great Stone.Thus long have I talked with thee in bidding thee depart, that the memory of theAethyr might be dulled; for hadst thou come back suddenly into thy mortal frame,thou hadst fallen into madness or death. For the vision is not such that any mayendure it.But now thy sense is dull, and the shew-stone but a stone. Therefore awake, andgive secretly and apart the sign of the Mother, and call four times upon thename of CHAOS, that is the four-fold word that is equal to her seven-fold word.And then shalt thou purify thyself, and return into the World.So I did that which was commanded me, and returned.BISKRA.December 17, 1909. 9:30-11:30 A.M.THE CRY OF THE 2ND AETHYRWHICH IS CALLED ARNIn the first place, there is again the woman riding on the bull, which is thereflection of BABALON, that rideth on The Beast. And also there is an Assyrianlegend of a woman with a fish, and also there is a legend of Eve and theSerpent, for Cain was the child of Eve and the Serpent, and not of Eve and Adam;and therefore when he had slain his brother, who was the first murderer, havingsacrificed living things to his demon, had Cain the mark upon his brow, which isthe mark of the Beast spoken of in the Apocalypse, and is the sign ofinitiation.The shedding of blood is necessary, for God did not hear the children of Eveuntil blood was shed. And that is external religion; but Cain spake not withGod, nor had the mark of initiation upon his brow, so that he was shunned of allmen, until he had shed blood. And this blood was the blood of his brother. Thisis a mystery of the sixth key of the Taro, which ought not to be called TheLovers, but The Brothers.In the middle of the card stands Cain; in his right hand is the Hammer of Thorwith which he hath slain his brother, and it is all wet with his blood. And hisleft hand he holdeth open as a sign of innocence. And on his right hand is hismother Eve, around whom the serpent is entwined with his hood spread behind herhead; and on his left hand is a figure somewhat like the Hindoo Kali, but muchmore seductive. Yet I know it to be Lilith. And above him is the Great Sigil ofthe Arrow, downward, but it is struck through the heart of the child. This Childalso is Abel. And the meaning of this part of the card is obscure, but that isthe correct drawing of the Taro card; and that is the correct magical fable fromwhich the Hebrew scribes, who were not complete Initiates, stole their legend ofthe Fall and the subsequent events. They joined different fables together to tryand make a connected story, and they sophisticated them to suit their social andpolitical conditions.All this while no image hath come into the Stone, and no voice hath been heard.I cannot get any idea of the source of what I have been saying. All I can sayis, that there is a sort of dew, like mist, upon the Stone, and yet it hasbecome hot to the touch.All I get is that the Apocalypse was a recension of a dozen or so totallydisconnected allegories, that were pieced together, and ruthlessly planed downto make them into a connected account; and that recension was rewritten andedited in the interests of Christianity, because people were complaining thatChristianity could show no true spiritual knowledge, or any food for the bestminds: nothing but miracles, which only deceived the most ignorant, andTheology, which only suited pedants.So a man got hold of this recension, and turned it Christian, and imitated thestyle of John. And this explains why the end of the world does not happen everyfew years, as advertised.There is nothing whatever in the Stone but a White Rose. And a voice comes:there shall be no more red roses, for she hath crushed all the blood of allthings into her cup.It seemed at one time as if the rose was in the breast of a beautiful woman,high-bosomed, tall, stately, yet who danced like a snake. But there was nosubsistence in this vision.And now I see the white Rose, as if it were in the beak of a swan, in thepicture by Michael Angelo in Venice. And that legend too is the legend ofBABALON.But all this is before the veil of the Aethyr. Now will I go and make certainpreparations, and I will return and repeat the call of the Aethyr yet again.BISKRA.December 18, 1909. 9:20-10:5 A.M.It is not a question of being unable to get into the Aethyr, and trying tostruggle through; but one is not anywhere near it.A voice comes: When thy dust shall strew the earth whereon She walketh, thenmayest thou bear the impress of Her foot. And thou thinkest to behold Her face!The Stone is become of the most brilliant whiteness, and yet, in that whiteness,all the other colours are implicit. The colour of anything is but its dullness,its obstructiveness. So is it with these visions. All that they are is falsity.Every idea merely marks where the mind of the Seer was too stupid to receive thelight, and therefore reflected it. Therefore, as the pure light is colourless,so is the pure soul black.And this is the Mystery of the incest of CHAOS with his daughter.There is nothing whatever visible.But I asked of an Angel that is at my side if the ceremony hath been dulyperformed. And he says: Yes, the Aethyr is present. It is thou that canst notperceive it, even as I cannot perceive it, because it is so entirely beyond thyconception that there is nothing in thy mind on to which it can cast a symbol,even as the emptiness of space is not heated by the fire of the sun. And so pureis the light that it preventeth the formation of images, and therefore have mencalled it darkness. For with any lesser light, the mind responds, and makes foritself divers palaces. It is that which is written: “In my Father's house thereare many mansions”; and if the house be destroyed, how much more the mansionsthat are therein! For this is the victory of BABALON over the Magician thatensorcelled her. For as the Mother she is 3 by 52, and as the harlot she is 6 by26; but she is also 12 by 13, and that is the pure unity. Moreover she is 4 by39, that is, victory over the power of the 4, and in 2 by 78 hath she destroyedthe great Sorcerer. Thus is she the synthesis of 1 and 2 and 3 and 4, whichbeing added are 10, therefore could she set her daughter upon her own throne,and defile her own bed with her virginity.And I ask the Angel if there is any way by which I can make myself worthy tobehold the Mysteries of this Aethyr.And he saith: It is not in my knowledge. Yet do thou make once more in silencethe Call of the Aethyr, and wait patiently upon the favour of the Angel, for Heis a mighty Angel, and never yet have I heard the whisper of his wing.This is the translation of the Call of the Aethyr:O ye heavens which dwell in the first Aire, and are mighty in the parts of theearth, and execute therein the judgment of the highest, to you it is said:Behold the face of your God, the beginning of comfort, whose eyes are thebrightness of the heavens which provided you for the government of the earth,and her unspeakable variety, furnishing you with a power of understanding, thatye might dispose all things according to the foresight of Him that sitteth onthe Holy Throne, and rose up in the beginning, saying, The earth, let her begoverned by her parts (this is the prostitution of BABALON to Pan) and let therebe division in her (the formation of the Many from the One) that her glory maybe always ecstasy and irritation of orgasm. Her course let it round with theheavens (that is, let her way be always harmonious with heaven) and as anhandmaid let her serve them (that is, the Virgin of Eternity climbing into thebed of CHAOS). One season let it confound another (that is, let there beunwearying variety of predicates) and let there be no creature upon or withinher the same (that is, let there be an unwearying variety of subjects). All hermembers let them differ in their qualities, and let there be no one creatureequal with another (for if there were any duplication or omission, there wouldbe no perfection in the whole). The reasonable creatures of the earth and men,let them vex and weed out one another (this is, the destruction of reason byinternecine conflicts in the course of redemption). And their dwelling places,let them forget their names. (This is, the arising of Nemo.) The work of man andhis pomp, let them be defaced. (That is, in the Great Work man must lose hispersonality.) His building, let it be a cave for the Beast of the Field. (“Hisbuilding” means the Vault of the Adepts, and the “Cave” is the Cave of theMountain of Abiegnus, and the “Beast” is he upon whom BABALON rideth, and the“Field” is the supernal Eden.) Confound her understanding with darkness. (Thissentence is explained by what has been said concerning Binah.) For why, itrejoiceth me concerning the Virgin and the Man. (Kelly did not understand thisCall at all, and he would not believe this sentence was written so, for itseemed to contradict the rest of the Call, so he altered it.) One while let herbe known and another while a stranger (that is, the Mystery of the Holy Onebeing at the same time identical with everything and apart from it) because sheis the bed of an harlot, and the dwelling of him that is fallen. (That is thatMystery which was revealed in the last Aethyr; the universe being, as it were, agarden wherein the Holy Ones may take their pleasure.) O ye heavens, arise; thelower heavens beneath you, let them serve you. (This is a command for the wholeof things to join in universal rapture.) Govern those that govern; cast downsuch as fall; bring forth those that increase; and destroy the rotten. (Thismeans that everything shall take its own pleasure in its own way.) No place letit remain in one number. (“No place” is the infinite Ain.... “Let remain in onenumber”; that is, let it be concentrated in Kether.) Add and diminish until thestars be numbered. (It is a mystery of the Logos being formulated by theQabalah, because the stars are all letters of the Holy Alphabet, as it was saidin a former Aethyr.) Arise! Move! and Appear! before the covenant of his mouthwhich he hath shewn unto us in his justice. (“The Covenant” is the letter Aleph;“His mouth,” pe; “His Justice,” lamed; and these add up again to Aleph, so thatit is in the letter Aleph, which is zero, thus symbolizing the circles of theAethyrs, that he calleth them forth. But men thought that Aleph was the initialof ARR, cursing, when it was really the initial of AChD, unity, and AHBH, love.So that it was the most horrible and wicked blasphemy of the blackest of all theblack brothers to begin Berashith with a beth, with the letter of the Magician.Yet, by this simple device, hath he created the whole illusion of sorrow.) Openthe mysteries of your creation, and make us partakers of the undefiledknowledge. (The word here “IADNAMAD” is not the ordinary word for knowledge. Itis a word of eight letters, which is the secret name of God, summarized in theletter cheth; for which see the Aethyr which correspondeth to that letter, thetwelfth Aethyr.)Now from time to time I have looked into the Stone, but never is there any imagetherein, or any hint thereof; but now there are three arrows, arranged thus:Image [../Images/image00223.jpeg]This is the letter Aleph in the Alphabet of Arrows.(I want to say that while I was doing the translation of the Call of theAethyrs, the soles of my feet were burning, as if I were on red hot steel.)And now the fire has spread all over me, and parches me, and tortures me. And mysweat is bitter like poison. And all my blood is acrid in my veins, like gleet.I seem to be all festering, rotting; and the worms eating me while I am yetalive.A voice, neither in myself nor out of myself, is saying: Remember Prometheus;remember Ixion.I am tearing at nothing. I will not heed. For even this dust must be consumedwith fire.And now, although there is no image, at last there is a sense of obstacle, as ifone were at length drawing near to the frontier of the Aethyr.But I am dying.I can neither strive nor wait. There is agony in my ears, and in my throat, andmine eyes have been so long blind that I cannot remember that there ever wassuch a thing as sight.And it cometh to me that I should go away, and await the coming of the veil ofthe Aethyr; not here. I think I will go to the Hot Springs.So I put away the Stone upon my breast.BISKRA.10:15-11152 A.M.Flashes of lightning are playing in the Stone, at the top; and at the bottom ofthe Stone there is a black pyramid, and at the top thereof is a vesica piscis.The vesica piscis is of colourless brilliance.The two curves of Pisces are thus:Image [../Images/image00224.jpeg]They are the same curves as the curves of vesica piscis, but turned round.And a voice comes: How can that which is buried in the pyramids behold thatwhich descendeth upon its apex?Again it comes to me, without voice: Therefore is motherhood the symbol of theMasters. For first must they give up their virginity to be destroyed, and theseed must lie hidden in them while the nine moons wax and wane, and they mustsurround it with the Universal Fluid. And they must feed it with blood for fire.Then is the child a living thing. And afterwards is much suffering and much joy,and after that are they torn asunder, and this is all their thank, that theygive it to suck.All this while the vision in the Shew-Stone stays as it was, save that thelightning grows more vehement and clear; and behind the vesica piscis is a blackcross extending to the top and to the edges of the Stone. And now blacknessspreads, and swallows up the images.Now there is naught but the vast black triangle having the apex downwards, andin the centre of the black triangle is the face of Typhon, the Lord of theTempest, and he crieth aloud: Despair! Despair! For thou mayest deceive theVirgin, and thou mayest cajole the Mother; but what wilt thou say unto theancient Whore that is throned in Eternity? For if she will not, there is neitherforce nor cunning, nor any wit, that may prevail upon her.Thou canst not woo her with love, for she is love. And she hath all, and hath noneed of thee.And thou canst not woo her with gold, for all the kings and captains of theearth, and all the gods of heaven, have showered their gold upon her. Thus hathshe all, and hath no need of thee.And thou canst not woo her with knowledge, for knowledge is the thing that shehath spurned. She hath it all, and hath no need of thee.And thou canst not woo her with wit, for her Lord is Wit. She hath it all, andhath no need of thee. Despair! Despair!Nor canst thou cling to her knees and ask for pity; nor canst thou cling to herheart and ask for love; nor canst thou put thine arms about her neck, and askfor understanding; for thou hast had all these, and they avail thee not.Despair! Despair!Then I took the Flaming Sword, and I let it loose against Typhon, so that hishead was cloven asunder, and the black triangle dissolved in lightnings.But as he parted his voice broke out again: Nor canst thou win her with theSword, for her eyes are fixed upon the eyes of Him in whose hand is the hilt ofthe Sword. Despair! Despair!And the echo of that cry was his word, which is identical, although it bediverse: Nor canst thou win her by the Serpent, for it was the Serpent thatseduced her first. Despair! Despair!(Yet he cried thus as he fled:)I am Leviathan, the great Lost Serpent of the Sea. I writhe eternally intorment, and I lash the ocean with my tail into a whirlpool of foam that isvenomous and bitter, and I have no purpose. I go no whither. I can neither livenor die. I can but rave and rave in my death agony. I am the Crocodile thateateth up the children of men. And through the malice of BABALON I hunger,hunger, hunger.All this while the Stone is more inert than ever yet; a thousand times morelifeless than when it is not invoked. Now, when it kindles, it only kindles intoits physical beauty. And now upon the face of it is a great black Rose, each ofwhose petals, though it be featureless, is yet a devil-face. And all the stalksare the black snakes of hell. It is alive, this Rose; a single thought informsit. It comes to clutch, to murder. Yet, because a single thought alone informsit, I have hope therein.I think this Rose has a hundred and fifty-six petals, and though it be black, ithas the luminous blush.There it is, in the midst of the Stone, and I cannot see anyone who wears it.Aha! Aha! Aha! Shut out the sight!Holy, Holy, Holy art thou!Light, Life and Love are like three glow-worms at thy feet: the whole universeof stars, the dewdrops on the grass whereon thou walkest!I am quite blind.Thou art Nuit! Strain, strain, strain my whole soul!A ka duaTuf ur biuBi a'a chefuDudu ner af an nuteru.Falutli! Falutli!I cling unto the burning Aethyr like Lucifer that fell through the Abyss, and bythe fury of his flight kindled the air.And I am Belial, for having seen the Rose upon thy breast, I have denied God.And I am Satan! I am Satan! I am cast out upon a burning crag! And the sea boilsabout the desolation thereof. And already the vultures gather, and feast upon myflesh.Yea! Before thee all the most holy is profane, O thou desolator of shrines! Othou falsifier of the oracles of truth! Ever as I went, hath it been thus. Thetruth of the profane was the falsehood of the Neophyte, and the truth of theNeophyte was the falsehood of the Zelator! Again and again the fortress must bebattered down! Again and again the pylon must be overthrown! Again and againmust the gods be desecrated!And now I lie supine before thee, in terror and abasement. O Purity! O Truth!What shall I say? My tongue cleaveth to my jaws, O thou Medusa that hast turnedme into stone! Yet is that stone the stone of the philosophers. Yet is thattongue Hadit.Aha! Aha!Yea! Let me take the form of Hadit before thee, and sing:A ka duaTuf ur biuBi a'a chefuDudu ner af an nuteru.Nuit! Nuit! How art thou manifested in this place! This is a Mystery ineffable.And it is mine, and I can never reveal it either to God or to man. It is forthee and me!Aha! Aha!A ka duaTuf ur biuBi a'a chefuDudu ner af an nuteru.... My spirit is not more; my soul is no more. My life leaps out intoannihilation!A ka duaTuf ur biuBi a'a chefuDudu ner af an nuteru.It is the cry of my body! Save me! I have come too close, I have come too closeto that which may not be endured. It must awake, the body; it must assertitself.It must shut out the Aethyr, or else it is dead.Every pulse aches, and beats furiously. Every nerve stings like a serpent. Andmy skin is icy cold.Neither God nor man can penetrate the Mystery of the Aethyr.(Here the See mutters unintelligibly.)And even that which understandeth cannot hear its voice. For to the profane thevoice of the Neophyte is called silence, and to the Neophyte the voice of theZelator is called silence. And so ever is it.Sight is fire, and is the first angle of the Tablet; spirit is hearing, and isthe centre thereof; thou, therefore, who art all spirit and fire, and hast noduller elements in thy star; thou art come to sight at the end of thy will. Andif thou wilt hear the voice of the Aethyr, do thou invoke it in the night,having no other light but the light of the half moon. Then mayest thou hear thevoice, though it may be that thou understandeth it not. Yet shall it be a potentspell, whereby thou mayest lay bare the womb of thine understanding to theviolence of CHAOS.Now, therefore, for the last time, let the veil of the Aethyr be torn.Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!A ka duaTuf ur biuBi a'a chefuDudu ner af an nuteru.This Aethyr must be left unfinished then until the half moon.HAMMAM SALAHIN.December 18, 3:10-4:35 P.M.An olvah nu arenu olvah.

And of these some were nympholept. For it wasnot a nymph, but I myself that walked upon the earth taking my pleasure. So alsothere were many images of Pan, and men adored them, and as a beautiful god hemade their olives bear double and their vines increase; but some were slain bythe god, for it was I that had woven the garlands about him.Now cometh a song.So sweet is this song that no one could resist it. For in it is all thepassionate ache of the moonlight, and the great hunger of the sea, and theterror of desolate places—all things that lure men to the unattainable.Image [../Images/image00228.jpeg]TranslationI am the harlot that shaketh Death.This shaking giveth the Peace of Satiate Lust.Immortality jetteth from my skull,And music from my vulva.Immortality jetteth from my vulva also,For my Whoredom is a sweet scent like a seven-stringed instrument,Played unto God the Invisible, the all-ruler,That goeth along giving the shrill scream of orgasm.Every man that hath seen me forgetteth me never, and I appear oftentimes in thecoals of the fire, and upon the smooth white skin of woman, and in the constancyof the waterfall, and in the emptiness of deserts and marshes, and upon greatcliffs that look seaward; and in many strange places, where men seek me not. Andmany thousand times he beholdeth me not. And at the last I smite myself into himas a vision smiteth into a stone and whom I call must follow.Now I perceive myself standing in a Druid circle, in an immense open plain.A whole series of beautiful visions of deserts and sunsets and islands in thesea, green beyond imagination ... But there is no subsistence in them.A voice goes on: this is the holiness of fruitless love and aimless toil. For indoing the thing for the thing's sake is concentration, and this is the holinessof them that suit not the means to the end. For therein is faith and sympathyand a knowledge of the true Magick.Oh my beloved, that fliest in the air like a dove, beware of the falcon! oh mybeloved, that springest upon the earth like a gazelle, beware of the lion!There are hundreds of visions, trampling over one another. In each one the Angelof the Aethyr is mysteriously hidden.Now I will describe the Angel of the Aethyr until the voice begins again.He is like one's idea of Sappho and Calypso, and all seductive and deadlythings; heavy eye-lids, long lashes, a face like ivory, wonderful barbaricjewellery, intensely red lips, a very small mouth, tiny ears, a Grecian face.Over the shoulders is a black robe with a green collar; the robe is spangledwith golden stars; the tunic is a pure soft blue.Now the whole Aethyr is swallowed up in a forest of unquenchable fire, andfearlessly through it all a snow-white eagle flies. And the eagle cries: thehouse also of death. Come away! The volume of the book is open, the Angelwaiteth without, for the summer is at hand. Come away! For the Aeon is measured,and thy span allotted. Come away! For the mighty sounds have entered into everyangle. And they have awakened the Angels of the Aethyrs that slept these threehundred years.For in the Holy letter Shin, that is the Resurrection in the Book of Thoth, thatis the Holy Spirit in the Trinity, that is three hundred in the tale of theyears, hath the tomb been opened, so that this great wisdom might be revealed.Come away! For the Second Triad is completed, and there remaineth only the Lordof the Aeon, the Avenger, the Child both Crowned and Conquering, the Lord of theSword and the Sun, the Babe in the Lotus, pure from his birth, the Child ofsuffering, the Father of justice, unto whom be the glory throughout all theAeon!20 [part0008.xhtml#vis-aft20]Come away! For that which was to be accomplished is accomplished, seeing thatthou hadst faith unto the end of all.In the letter N the Voice of the Aethyr is ended.BISKRA, ALGERIA.December 20, 1909. 8:35-9:35 P.M."},{"pageContent":"THE CRY OF THE 1ST AETHYRWHICH IS CALLED LILFirst, let praise and worship and honour and glory and great thanks be givenunto the Holy One, who hath permitted us to come thus far, who hath revealedunto us the ineffable mysteries, that they might be disclosed before men. And wehumbly beseech His infinite goodness that he will be pleased to manifest unto useven the Mystery of the First Aethyr.(Here folioweth the Call of the Aethyr.)The veil of the Aethyr is like the veil of night, dark azure, full of countlessstars.

Profound peace filleth me—beyondecstasy, beyond thought, beyond being itself, IAIDA. (This word means “I am,”but in a sense entirely beyond being.)(Note: In Hebrew letters it adds to 26. In Hebrew letters the name of the Aethyris 70, ayin; but by turning the Yetziratic attributions of the letters intoHebrew, it gives 66, and 66 is the sum of the numbers from o to 11.)Yes; there is peace. There is no tendency of any sort, much less any observationor feeling or impression. There is only a faint consciousness, like the scent ofjasmine.The body of the Seer is rested in a waking sleep that is deeper than sleep, andhis mind is still; he seems like a well in the desert, shaded by windless palms.And it is night; and because the night is the whole night of space, and not thepartial night of earth, there is no thought of dawn. For the light of the Sunmaketh illusion, blinding man's eyes to the glory of the stars. And unless he bein the shadow of the earth, he cannot see the stars. So, also, unless he behidden from the light of life, he cannot behold Nuit. Here, then, do I abide inunalterable midnight, utterly at peace.I have forgotten where I am, and who I am. I am hanging in nothing.Now the veil opens of itself. (To Scribe: Come nearer; I don't want to have tospeak so loudly.)It is a little child covered with lilies and roses. He is supported by countlessmyriads of Archangels. The Archangels are all the same colourless brilliance,and every one of them is blind. Below the Archangels again are many, many otherlegions, and so on far below, so far that the eye cannot pierce. And on hisforehead, and on his heart, and in his hand, is the secret sigil of the Beast.And of all this the glory is so great that all the spiritual senses fail, andtheir reflections in the body fail.It is very strange. In my heart is rapture, holy and ineffable, absolutelybeyond emotion; beyond even that bliss called Ananda, infinitely calm and pure.Yet at the gates of mine eyes stand tears, like warriors upon the watch, thatlean on their spears, listening.21 [part0008.xhtml#vis-aft21]The great and terrible Angel keeps on looking at me, as if to bar me from thevision. There is another blinding my mind. There is another forcing my head downin sleep.(It's very difficult to talk at all, because an impression takes such an immensetime to travel from the will to the muscles. Naturally, I've no idea of time.)I have gone up again to the child, led by two Angels, abasing my head.This child seems to be the child that one attempted to describe in “The Gardenof Janus.”Every volition is inhibited. I have tried to say a lot, and it has always gotlost on the way.Holy art thou, O more beautiful than all the stars of the Night!There has never been such peace, such silence. But these are positive things.Singing praises of things eternal amid the flames of first glory, and every noteof every song is a fresh flower in the garland of peace.This child danceth not, but it is because he is the soul of the two dances—theright hand and the left hand, and in him they are one dance, the dance withoutmotion.There is dew on all the fire. Every drop is the quintessence of the ecstasy ofstars.Yet a third time am I led to him, prostrating myself seven times at every step.There is a perfume in the air, reflected down even to the body of the seer. Thatperfume thrills his body with an ecstasy that is like love, like sleep.And this is the song:I am the child of all who am the father of all, for from me came forth allthings, that I might be. I am the fountain in the snows, and I am the eternalsea. I am the lover, and I am the beloved, and I am the first-fruits of theirlove. I am the first faint shuddering of the light, and I am the loom whereinnight weaveth her impenetrable veil.I am the captain of the hosts of eternity; of the swordsmen and the spearmen andthe bowmen and the charioteers. I have led the armies of the east against thearmies of the west, and the armies of the west against the armies of the east.For I am Peace.My groves of olive were planted by an harlot, and my horses were bred by athief. I have trained my vines upon the spears of the Most High, and with mylaughter have I slain a thousand men.With the wine in my cup have I mixed the lightnings, and I have carved my breadwith a sharp sword.With my folly have I undone the wisdom of the Magus, even as with my judgments Ihave overwhelmed the universe. I have eaten the pomegranate in the House ofWrath, and I have crushed out the blood of my mother between mill-stones to makebread.There is nothing that I have not trampled beneath my feet. There is nothing thatI have not set a garland on my brow. I have wound all things about my waist as agirdle. I have hidden all things in the cave of my heart. I have slain allthings because I am Innocence. I have lain with all things because I amUntouched Virginity. I have given birth to all things because I am Death.Stainless are my lips, for they are redder than the purple of the vine, and ofthe blood wherewith I am intoxicated. Stainless is my forehead, for it is whiterthan the wind and the dew that cooleth it.I am light, and I am night, and I am that which is beyond them.I am speech, and I am silence, and I am that which is beyond them.I am life, and I am death, and I am that which is beyond them.I am war, and I am peace, and I am that which is beyond them.I am weakness and I am strength, and I am that which is beyond them.Yet by none of these can man reach up to me. Yet by each of them must man reachup to me.Thou shalt laugh at the folly of the fool. Thou shalt learn the wisdom of thewise. And thou shalt be initiate in holy things. And thou shalt be learned inthe things of love. And thou shalt be mighty in the things of war. And thoushalt be adept in things occult. And thou shalt interpret the oracles. And thoushalt drive all these before thee in thy car, and though by none of these canstthou reach up to me, yet by each of these must thou attain to me. And thou musthave the strength of the lion, and the secrecy of the hermit. And thou must turnthe wheel of life. And thou must hold the balances of Truth. Thou must passthrough the great Waters, a Redeemer. Thou must have the tail of the scorpion,and the poisoned arrows of the Archer, and the dreadful horns of the Goat. Andso shalt thou break down the fortress that guardeth the Palace of the King myson. And thou must work by the light of the Star and of the Moon and of the Sun,and by the dreadful light of judgment that is the birth of the Holy Spiritwithin thee. When these shall have destroyed the universe, then mayest thouenter the palace of the Queen my daughter.Blessed, blessed blessed; yea, blessed; thrice and four times blessed is he thathath attained to look upon thy face. For I will hurl thee forth from my presenceas a whirling thunderbolt to guard the ways, and whom thou smitest shall besmitten indeed. And whom thou lovest shall be loved indeed. And whether bysmiting or by love thou workest, each one shall see my face, a glimmer through athousand veils. And they shall rise up from love's sleep or death's, and girdthemselves with a girdle of snake-skin for wisdom, and they shall wear the whitetunic of purity, and the apron of flaming orange for will, and over theirshoulders shall they cast the panther's skin of courage. And they shall wear thenemyss of secrecy and the ateph crown of truth. And on their feet shall they putsandals made of the skin of beasts, that they may trample upon all they were,yet also that its toughness shall support them, and protect their feet, as theypass upon the mystical way that lieth through the pylons. And upon their breastsshall be the Rose and Cross of light and life, and in their hands the hermit'sstaff and lamp. Thus shall they set out upon the never-ending journey, each stepof which is an unutterable reward.Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy; yea, thrice and four times holy art thou, because thouhast attained to look upon my face; not by my favour only, not by thy magickonly, may this be won. Yet it is written: “Unto the persevering mortal theblessed Immortals are swift.”Mighty, mighty, mighty, mighty; yea, thrice and four times mighty art thou. Hethat riseth up against thee shall be thrown down, though thou raise not so muchas thy little finger against him. And he that speaketh evil against thee shallbe put to shame, though thy lips utter not the littlest syllable against him.And he that thinketh evil concerning thee shall be confounded in his thought,although in thy mind arise not the least thought of him. And they shall bebrought unto subjection unto thee, and serve thee, though thou wiliest it not.And it shall be unto them a grace and a sacrament, and ye shall all sit downtogether at the supernal banquet, and ye shall feast upon the honey of the gods,and be drunk upon the dew of immortality—FOR I AM HORUS, THE CROWNED ANDCONQUERING CHILD, WHOM THOU KNEWEST NOT!Pass thou on, therefore, O thou Prophet of the Gods, unto the Cubical Altar ofthe Universe; there shalt thou receive every tribe and kingdom and nation intothe mighty Order that reacheth from the frontier fortresses that guard theUttermost Abyss unto My Throne.This is the formula of the Aeon, and with that the voice of LIL, that is theLamp of the Invisible Light, is ended. Amen.BISKRA, ALGERIA.December 19, 1909. 1:30-3:30 P.M.A COMMENT UPON THE NATURES OF THE AETHYRS30. Without the cube—the material world—is the sphere-system of the spiritualworld enfolding it. The Cry seems to be a sort of Exordium, an external showingforth of the coming of the new Aeon, the Aeon of Horus the crowned child.29. The disturbance of Equilibrium caused by the Coming of the Aeon.28. Now is a further and clearer shadowing-forth of the Great Mystery of theAeon which is to be led up to by the Aethyrs. Note however that the King of theNew Aeon never appears until the very first Aethyr.27. Hecate appears—her son, the son of a Virgin, a magus, is to bring the Aeonto pass. And she, the herald, her function fulfilled, withdraws within hermystic veil.26. The death of the past Aeon, that of Jehovah and Jesus; ends with adumbrationof the new, the vision of the Stele of Ankh-f-n-khonsu, whose discovery broughtabout in a human consciousness the knowledge of the Equinox of the Gods,21/3/04.25. Appearance of the Lion God of Horus, the child of Leo that incarnates him.The first Angel is Isis its mother.24. Now appears his mate, the heavenly Venus, the Scarlet Woman, who by men isthought of as Babalon as he is thought of as Chaos.23. Here appear the Cherubim, the other officers of the new Temple, the earthand water assistants of the fire and air Beast and Scarlet Woman.22. Here is the First Key to the formula of Horns, a sevenfold arrangement. Ashadow of Horus declares his nature.21. This seems to be the Vision of God face to face that is the necessary ordealfor him who would pass the Abyss, as it were. A commission to be the prophet ofthe Aeon arising is given to the Seer. The God is the Hierophant in the Ceremonyof Magister Templi.20. A guide is given to the Seer, his Holy Guardian Angel. And this is attainedby a mastery of the Universe conceived as a wheel. The Hiereus in the Ceremonyof Magister Templi.19. Now cometh forth the Angel who giveth instruction, in the lowest form. TheHegemone in the Ceremony of Magister Templi which the Seer is about to undergo.18. The Vault of preparation for the Ceremony of M.T.The Veil is the Crucifixion, symbol of the dead Aeon. The first ordeal isundergone.17. The symbol of the Balance is now given unto the Aspirant.16. The sacrifice is made. The High Priestess (image of Babalon) cometh forthupon her Beast and maketh this.15. The mystic dance by Salome. The new Temple, the signs of the grades arereceived and the A.E. rejected.14. The Shrine of Darkness. Final initiation into grade of M.T.13. The emergence of Nemo into the world; his work therein. This is the firstmystery revealed to a M.T.12. The Second Mystery: the cup-bearer of Babalon the beautiful. The Holy Grailmanifested to the M.T., with the first knowledge of the Black Brothers.11. Now cometh the Frontier of the Holy City; the M.T. is taken into the Abyss.10. The Abyss.9. The M.T. hath passed the Abyss, and is led to the Palace of the Virginredeemed from Malkuth unto Binah.8. The fuller manifestation of the Holy Guardian Angel.7. The Virgin become the Bride, the great Reward of the Ceremony. Also anadumbration of the Further Progress.6. A shadowing-forth of the grade of Magus.5. The reception of the M.T. among the Brethren of the A Image[../Images/image00208.jpeg] A Image [../Images/image00208.jpeg]. The manifestionof the Arrow.4. Further concerning the Magus. The marriage of Chaos with the purified Virgin.3. The Magician. Exhibition of the Guards to the Higher Knowledge.2. The understanding of the Curse, that is become a Blessing. The final rewardof the M.T., his marriage even with Babalon Herself. The paean thereof.1. The final manifestation. All leads up to the Crowned Child, Horus, the Lordof the New Aeon.Image [../Images/image00229.jpeg]1 [part0007.xhtml#vis-ft1]. The LVX Cross hidden in the Svastika is probably theArcanum here connoted. This Cross on Mars square adds to 65 Adonai, Shone,Gloried, ha-Yekal HS=keep silence. Svastika itself adds to 231 = 0 + 1 + 2 + - -- + 21, the 21 Keys. The cubical Svastika regarded as composed of this LVX Crossand the arms has a total of 78 faces—Taro and Mezla.2 [part0007.xhtml#vis-ft2]. In the light of the cry of LOE, this passage seemsto mean precisely the opposite of its apparent meaning.3 [part0007.xhtml#vis-ft3]. These are intended to show symbolically that theBull is the same as the Eagle.4 [part0007.xhtml#vis-ft4]. This night I took the shew-stone to my breast tosleep, and immediately a Dhyana arose of the sun, seen more clearly afterwardsas the Star. Exceeding was its brilliance.5 [part0007.xhtml#vis-ft5]. It was done.—O. V.6 [part0007.xhtml#vis-ft6]. The Doctrine implied is that one must not be thechild, but the Mother7 [part0007.xhtml#vis-ft7]. No angel has been mentioned. The Seer was lost tobeing.8 [part0007.xhtml#vis-ft8]. This I performed in a sort of cave upon the ridge ofa great mountain in the Desert near Bou-Saada at 12-3 P.M. on December 2.9 [part0007.xhtml#vis-ft9]. Note that the comer letters in this table are all B=Image [../Images/image00230.jpeg].10 [part0007.xhtml#vis-ft10]. Since the examination in the amphitheatre I havebeen a naked spirit without garments or anything; by garments he means the body.11 [part0007.xhtml#vis-ft11]. I suppose that only a Magus could have heard thisword.12 [part0007.xhtml#vis-ft12]. I think the trouble with these people was, thatthey wanted to substitute the blood of someone else for their own blood, becausethey wanted to keep their personalities.13 [part0007.xhtml#vis-ft13]. Full title of Jesod is Tzediq Jesod Olahm, “TheRighteous is the Foundation of the World.”14 [part0007.xhtml#vis-ft14]. I. S. V. D., Jesod, = 80, the number of Pé, theletter of Mars.15 [part0007.xhtml#vis-ft15]. Originally, for “Understanding” was written“Power.” Choronzon was always using some word that did not represent histhought, because there is no proper link between his thought and speech. Notethat he never seems able to distinguish between the Frater and the Scribe, andaddresses first one, then the other, in the same sentence.16 [part0007.xhtml#vis-ft16]. These words are probably BABALON, ChAOS, TARO.17 [part0007.xhtml#vis-ft17]. The fourth of the mystic numbers of Jupiter is136.18 [part0007.xhtml#vis-ft18]. Image [../Images/image00231.jpeg] and Image[../Images/image00232.jpeg], the Sun, the Balance or plumes of Maat, and theSnake. Added they make 280.19 [part0007.xhtml#vis-ft19]. I.e., that the circle should be thus profaned.This evil circle is of three concentric rings.20 [part0007.xhtml#vis-ft20]. The Seer had absolutely forgotten this prophecy,and was amazed at the final identification of the Child in LIL with Hoor.21 [part0008.xhtml#vis-ft21]. There are long intervals between many of theseparagraphs, the Seer having been lost to Being. The reader will note that “TheGreat and Terrible Angel” has not been mentioned, but comes in suddenly. Thiswas because the Seer's speech was inaudible, or never occurred. This angel wasthe “Higher Genius” of the Seer."},{"pageContent":"ABOUT THE AUTHORSALEISTER CROWLEY (1875-1947) poet, mountaineer, secret agent, magus, libertine,and prophet was dubbed by the tabloids “The Wickedest Man in the World.”LON MILO DUQUETTE is the author of sixteen critically acclaimed books(translated in twelve languages) on Magick and the Occult.

Time constraints suggestedI offer it to someone I could respect and trust. Richard Kaczynski was thenatural choice. A gifted scholar, he is well-versed in Thelema (the Greek wordmeaning “will,” by which Crowley's teaching is designated). Richard is theauthor of the excellent biography of Aleister Crowley, Perdurabo. He is ahigh-ranking member of O.T.O. whose service has gained him the admiration andappreciation of many. Our friendship allowed me to speak directly about myconcerns for a doctrinally accurate book. He cheerfully and humbly accepted mycondition that the work be vetted and approved by a carefully chosen board ofThelemic scholars and magicians.I am happy the gods have directed the project as they have. Richard and I comefrom different generations. He will be closer to the shared experiences of manyreaders than I might be. In 1977, the year he was enthusiastically bicyclinghome at age 14 with his first copy of Magick in Theory and Practice tucked inhis backpack, I was 29 and in the throes of a magical ordeal demanding I develop“certainty, not faith” to sustain my very life and sanity.This book is not an attempt to provide a broad survey of current Thelemic“offerings,” e.g. the multiplicity of recent “orders” and “schools ofinterpretation.” We acknowledge one A Image [../Images/image00208.jpeg] A Image[../Images/image00208.jpeg] and one O.T.O.We will also avoid the interpretations so common to much post-Crowley magicalliterature. This is an attempt to document Crowley's teaching as he designed hissystem, with some reference to the modern development of Thelema. O.T.O. FraterSuperior Hymenaeus Beta has spent many years brilliantly editing the corpus ofCrowley literature. I also highly recommend J. Daniel Gunther's Initiation inthe Aeon of the Child: The Inward Journey (Ibis Press, 2009), which is, in myopinion, the most important doctrinal contribution since Crowley's death.Otherwise, my recommendations on magical literature have remained unchanged fordecades. Read Crowley. If you don't understand what he is saying, buy adictionary. If you're still unclear about what he means, keep trying. Once in awhile you may be lucky enough to meet someone who can help shed light on thesubject. I sincerely hope Richard Kaczynski and this book can serve thatfunction for you. Crowley gave us a very intelligible guide to the importance heplaced on his individual writings by organizing them in a literaryclassification system. Richard explains this fully on page 33. Such a system isunique in the annals of religious history and is further confirmation ofAleister Crowley's stature as a world teacher.On a personal level, this book conjures the spirits of departed loved ones andguides—angel-headed hipsters whose lives are intimately entwined with my earlieryears and quest for an understanding of Aleister Crowley—Grady McMurtry, HarrySmith, Angus Maclise, and Richard Gernon.May this book serve as a Lamp to illumine your steps as you seek to discoveryour True Will.Love is the law, love under will."},{"pageContent":"DISCLAIMERWHEN A PERSON begins to study Aleister Crowley, he or she enters a universerather than a “field of study.” It is impossible for any individual to capturehis essence. Like the parable about the blind men describing an elephant, onecan only report what one is able to perceive. Add to that the limited amount ofspace available in an introductory book of this nature, and the reader willunderstand that we are only able to offer a glimpse of Crowley's teachings.THREE QUICK TIPS ON THELEMIC ETIQUETTE 1. Please be sure to properly capitalize “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law,” or “Love is the law, love under will” in your correspondence. All quotes from a Class A text should be spelled and capitalized verbatim, “Change not as much as the style of a letter ...” (AL I:54). 2. The name “Crowley” rhymes with “holy.” He gave the definitive clue in his satirical poem “The Convert,” first published in The Winged Beetle. “Where are you going, so meek and holy?” “I'm going to temple to worship Crowley.” 3. We avoid the modern spelling of “magickal” for “magical,” or “magickian” for “magician.” There is not a single example of A.C. using that orthography in a bookcase full of his books. He coined the word “magick” to define his system, spelled the adjective “magical,” and called its practitioners “magicians.”"},{"pageContent":"OVERVIEWI STILL REMEMBER reading my first Crowley book, Magick in Theory and Practice,at the tender and impressionable age of 14.

Clearly it meant something, but themeaning played a sadistic hide-and-seek game with my consciousness, like one ofthose fantastic dreams that becomes less coherent the more you awaken. I vowedto decipher this book. This has turned into a lifetime task. There were nobeginner's guides. I hope this Concise Guide to Aleister Crowley will help thereader gain a more clear sense of his system.Crowley had an imposing reputation in life, and since death he casts an evenlarger shadow. He left his mark in so many different ways that he defiescategorization. Most of us would be satisfied to accomplish just one of his manyimpressive achievements: * A practicing occultist whose mastery of Western magick and Eastern mysticism was unsurpassed by any of his contemporaries, and who continues to be an icon for many of today's practicing magicians. * The founder and prophet of the new religious movement of Thelema, best known by its oft-misunderstood catchphrase, “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.” * A prolific poet whose Collected Works, by age thirty, filled three volumes, and whose last published work, Olla, was subtitled Sixty Years of Song. * A maverick mountaineer whose numerous innovations and world records in the sport are acknowledged by even his most vocal critics. * An adventurer whose exploits in the Far East were serialized by Vanity Fair magazine as “A Burmese River.” * An impresario who took the violin troupe the Ragged Ragtime Girls on a tour of St. Petersburg, Russia. * A British secret agent who marshaled his literary and occult connections to the service of his country, including (reputedly) the invention of the “V for Victory” sign as a magical antidote to the swastika. * A ranked chess master who could trounce many players without even looking at the chess board. * A pioneering entheogenic explorer who conducted psychedelic experiments with mescaline. * Producer and star of The Rites of Eleusis, a series of ritualistic plays featuring an innovative blend of magick, drama, music, and poetry. * One of the most unjustly vilified men in the history of journalism, garnering headlines like “The Wickedest Man in the World” and “A Man We'd Like To Hang.”More mistruth and rumor has circulated about Aleister Crowley than perhaps anyother figure in recent history. When the reporter Henry Hall introduced him toreaders of the New York World Sunday Magazine, he wrote, “Some said that he wasa man of real attainments, others that he was a faker. All agreed that he wasextraordinary.”1 [part0014.xhtml#aft1] Crowley openly defied social conventions,challenging people to examine what they really believed and why they believedit. He confronted blind faith with rational skepticism. Yet he likewisechallenged the skeptic with scientific illuminism, a systematic approach tospirituality that he described as “The method of science, the aim of religion.”2[part0014.xhtml#aft2]1 [part0014.xhtml#ft1] Hall, Henry N. “Master Magician Reveals WeirdSupernatural Rites.” The World Magazine, 13 December 1914, p. 9, 17.2 [part0014.xhtml#ft2] This was the motto of his journal The Equinox, publishedbetween 1909 and 1913."},{"pageContent":"Image [../Images/image00242.jpeg]"}]
