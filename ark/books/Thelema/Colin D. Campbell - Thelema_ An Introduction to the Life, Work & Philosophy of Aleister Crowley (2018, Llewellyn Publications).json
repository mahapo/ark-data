So she answered him, bending down, a lambent flame of blue,all-touching, all penetrant, her lovely hands upon the black earth, & her lithebody arched for love, and her soft feet not hurting the little flowers: Thouknowest! And the sign shall be my ecstasy, the consciousness of the continuityof existence, the omnipresence of my body.—Liber AL vel Legis, I. V. 26.Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Aleister Crowley died in 1947 at the age of seventy-two. The whereabouts of hisashes remain a mystery. For twenty years after his death, his name and hisvoluminous writings remained for the most part undiscovered, unread, andunappreciated by all but a tiny band of former disciples, bohemian artists, anda handful of revolutionary thinkers. Then, on June 1, 1967, Crowley’sunmistakable visage appeared (glaring out at us from between the faces of Indianholy man Swami Sri Yukteswar and sex goddess Mae West) on the (then) mosteagerly awaited objet d’art on the planet—the album cover of the Beatles’ newestLP, Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.The cover art was the creation of artist Peter Blake, who wanted to surround theband with what he called “a magical crowd.” The inclusion of Swami SriYukteswar, Paramahansa Yogananda, and other Hindu yogis was George Harrison’sidea. Among characters John Lennon “liked” was the poet and “wickedest man inthe world” Aleister Crowley.Do not misunderstand me. I’m not suggesting that the Beatles or Peter Blake weredirectly responsible for the spiritual and cultural upheavals of the 1960s orthe storms that are still echoing (actively or reactively) in today’s chaoticworld. Nor am I suggesting John Lennon or Peter Blake should be singled out andcredited for igniting the revival of interest and appreciation of AleisterCrowley, Thelema, magick, or any of the progressive spiritual movements thatcontinue to proliferate today. Like all great artists at pivotal moments inhistory, these sensitive pioneers were merely among the first to react andrespond to the effects of a dramatic shift in human consciousness.Consciously or subconsciously, their works gave voice to the new reality. Theart they and their contemporaries created during those golden years pealed likea mighty bell that vibrated with the master “note” of this new universalconsciousnes, a note that rang out like a broadcast signal that triggeredsympathetic responses in the hearts and souls of all who were poised and ripefor awakening.The concept of evolving shifts in consciousness is not a new one. Almost everyancient culture had its version of “ages” (i.e., the Golden Age, when humanitywalked with the gods, or the Dark Age, when the gods abandoned us). The Hinduscall the various ages Yugas, 1 [Fwd.xhtml#footnote-000] which predictively riseand fall in cycles of thousands of millennia as our entire solar system careensaround the galactic center in a huge elliptical orbit.Astrologers have their own version of the cosmic cycles based on the apparentbackward movement of the signs of the zodiac relative to the position of therising sun on the spring equinox. It takes 2,160 years to traverse one completesign, and most astrologers compute that we have recently passed (or will soonpass) from the astrological Age of Pisces into the Age of Aquarius.Now, you may think it odd that I should begin these introductory words to Mr.Campbell’s marvelous book about Thelema by talking about 1960s pop stars andHindu theories of astrology, but (in my mind, at least) it illustrates the mostimportant thing to first understand when attempting to comprehend the meaningand significance of Thelema; that is, whether any of us are consciously aware ofit or not, within the last hundred years or so there has been a profound anddramatic shift (advance, transformation, mutation, amendment, metamorphosis,transfiguration, leap, refocus) in human consciousness. We are all nowfunctioning in an entirely new and different reality than the one in which ourrecent ancestors functioned. The old ways of doing business on every level ofour lives will never again work exactly like they used to.It’s not just the fact that our tastes have changed or that we hear music orappreciate art differently; it’s not just the fact that our understanding ofmathematics has exploded inwardly to irrational quantum levels or that ourunderstanding of astronomy has exploded outwardly and erased all old time anddimensional limitations; it’s not just the fact that many of the most fortunateamong us have the store of ten thousand years of human knowledge at ourelectronic fingertips or that many of us are now routinely accustomed toeducational, social, and economic liberties. No. All these things are simplysymptoms and by-products of a new essential factor in the great formula of humanconsciousness. The new factor isn’t anything complex or particularly esoteric.It is, however, significant enough to cause a new mutation in the DNA of ourconsciousness. The new factor is simply this: A new level of self-awareness.This might not sound very sexy or dramatic, but, in this new reality, nothingcould be more sexy or dramatic. This new awakening is disarmingly simple andfundamental. But, like the invisible wind, its existence only makes itself knownby the effects it has on other things. It’s really hard to make observationsabout self-awareness because the observer is the object being observed.Actually, the whole thing is simpler than it sounds. Allow me to offer anillustration of shifts in self-awareness.Our very ancient ancestors, while being cognizant of day and night, darkness andlight, heat and cold, comfort and discomfort, were primarily focused onday-to-day, moment-to-moment issues of immediate self-preservation. All humanactivities, whether conscious or instinctual, revolved around the preservationof the body through protection, nourishment, and the biological perpetuation ofthe species. All other observations or speculations about life or the worldaround us were projected against the screen of this reality and interpreted tosatisfy these immediate needs. Everything about our ancestors’ conscious andsubconscious lives (religious concepts and expressions, gods, spirits, myths,rituals, even art) was interpreted by the self-identity of a creature competingwith other creatures for food and survival.The metaphoric “Gods” that visibly ruled this level of consciousness-realitywere the earth itself and the earth’s human equivalent, woman, in particular theMother. Crowley named this phase of evolutionary consciousness the Aeon of Isisafter the great Egyptian Mother Goddess.Eventually, as our understanding of the world around us increased a bit, ourself-awareness shifted and received a fine-tuning. We started to see ourselvesas existing in a more complex and wondrous environment that we could partiallymanage and control. No longer did we see ourselves only as just anothercompeting creature but as a master creature that could exploit other creaturesand our environment. If we were cold, we could build or even travel to warmerlands. If we were hungry, we could cultivate plants rather than forage for them.We could domesticate and breed beasts rather than hunt them. Our eyes turned tothe sky and it became evident that the sun made the plants grow and luredanimals to come eat the plants. Summer and winter were sun-triggered events thatneeded to be dealt with. Gods and religions evolved to accommodate the newreality—the new self-identity. Existence was now seen as a partnership of sunand earth, father and mother.But along with this wakening came the new mystery formula—the formula of a sunthat dies every day and almost dies every winter. And this new formula broughtwith it our terrible preoccupation with death. Plants die and the dead seeds areburied and then magically reborn; the sun dies and needs to be magicallyresurrected; it only follows that I die and I will need to be magically broughtback to life.Crowley named this phase of evolutionary consciousness the Aeon of Osiris afterthe great Egyptian god of death and resurrection. It is a formula based on ourself-identity with the sun which dies and is magically reborn. It is the levelof consciousness that has fashioned the reality of our most recentancestors—their religion, politics, war, culture, art, literature, civilizationitself: everything.All that has changed. While the decaying zombie remnants of the Aeon of Osiriswill likely haunt us for the foreseeable future, a new age has dawned. Crowleynamed this new phase of evolutionary consciousness the Aeon of Horus, the childof Isis and Osiris. Instead of our conscious reality arising from the need fornourishment (as in the Aeon of Isis), or our obsession with overcoming death (asin the Aeon of Osiris), we now simply grow as naturally, as innocently, and asjoyously as a child—a child who will accept no limits to its potential growth.As unbelievably simple as it sounds, the factor that characterizes the essenceof our new self-identity, the factor that characterizes our new level ofconsciousness, is our universally accepted observation that the sun does notdie. It shines eternally. This simple new reality has permanently upgraded theoperating system of human consciousness. The sun does not die. We do not die.The sun shines eternally—we shine eternally. We now function as a unit ofself-awareness that deep down inside knows it does not die, that knows there isno off switch, that knows we’ve always been on and we’ll always be on.In the Aeon of Horus, eternal life is now simply understood as “theconsciousness of the continuity of existence.”Like Lao Tzu’s mysterious Tao, Thelema defies objective definition.Is it a philosophy? Although there are philosophical nuances to Thelema, it isbigger than philosophy. But, if we were to attempt to explain Thelema to someonewho needs to approach things from a philosophic angle, we could say “Thelema isa rational philosophy of spiritual self-sufficiency.”Is it a religion? Although there are infinite ways to incorporate yourunderstanding of Thelema in religious forms of expression, Thelema is biggerthan religion. But, if we were to attempt to explain Thelema to someone thatneeds to approach things from a classic religious angle, we could say, “Thelemais a rational religion of sun worship … if you define the word sun as alsomeaning yourself.”Is it a magical system? Although many magicians consider themselves Thelemites,Thelema is bigger than any particular system, technique, or study. Indeed, onceone has comfortably adjusted to the new level of self-awareness, Thelema servesonly to enhance, energize, and hybridize whatever philosophical, religious, ormagical systems or schools of thought you hold dear.Is it Crowley’s magical societies, O.T.O. and A 3dots [image/2.jpg] A 3 dots[image/2.jpg] ? Although these two organizations propagate the Law of Thelemaand the teachings of Aleister, Thelema is bigger that any organization, order,or school of instruction. As a matter of fact, Thelema is bigger than The Bookof the Law, or Aleister Crowley, or anything in heaven or Earth … but you.—Love is the law, love under will.Lon Milo DuQuette--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1.

Given a lifetimeof work by a prolific author—coupled with several lifetimes’ worth ofcontroversy!—it is no wonder that so many people miss the point of Crowleyentirely. It is easier to simply shrug one’s shoulders, accept the popularopinion, and accept his reputation as “the wickedest man in the world.” That’sthe danger of a dialectic: you miss all the finer points that linger between theblack and the white.When I first encountered Crowley, though I had studied magick for several years,I wasn’t sure what to make of him either. I could tell that he was a genius andthat he was speaking at a level I did not fully understand. While many of thethings he wrote shocked my sensibilities, I also had a growing suspicion thatthere was something more going on than what was presented on the page. Therewere points where he was deliberately provocative, brazenly and even absurdlysavage, yet I could not help but feel that it was written in a way that wasmeant to conceal something deeper. I would also come to recognize that some ofthose same sensibilities Crowley was challenging, ideas that I consideredfundamental to who I was as a person, were in fact holding me back from theperson I was meant to be. Such, one may argue, is the nature of illumination.One of the principal problems with Crowley is that you must read a lot of hiswork to even begin to understand what he is trying to convey. He can beexceptionally difficult for the beginner, writing as he did in veiled analogyand with reference to contemporary events that stymie even those well acquaintedwith the man and his work. At times it can feel like having half an equation,with the other half scattered across a dozen or so other unreferenced texts, ifeven there. Include the fact that he quite literally could not put certain ideasin print without trouble from the authorities, especially ideas related to sex,putting the pieces together can be difficult. All I can say is keep reading.In writing this work, keeping a consistently narrow scope of introductorymaterial was paramount. Those familiar with Crowley will argue, “Why didn’t youinclude … !” for one thing or another, which is fair enough. Not only did Irecognize that any manageable introduction to Crowley would be inadequate, Ihave counted on it. For this reason, additional references and suggestions forfurther reading are included within the chapters themselves. From here, thoseinterested in Crowley can begin looking deeper into his written works with somesense of direction and a foundation of basic knowledge. It is my sincere wishthat anyone reading this ultimately comes to a point where they understandenough to say how they would have done it better!My approach is to address Crowley in three distinct phases: history, philosophy,and practice. I begin with a short biography, since to understand Crowley’s lifehelps to better understand the context from which his philosophies arose. Thesecond section begins to unfold that philosophy itself, Thelema, a word thatmeans “will” in Greek. Finally, practices common to Thelemites, practitioners orfollowers of Thelema, are given to provide the reader an understanding of thepractices identifiable with, if not unique to, Crowley’s legacy.Now, to the point: Why Thelema? What, says the hardened critic, could the obtusemystical philosophies of an eccentric, Victorian-born, middling poet, sexualdeviant, devil worshipper, and drug addict possibly have to offer me? Suchobviously biased and salacious accusations aside, now, as then, the answer issimple: Crowley shows us a method for spiritual attainment that focuses on theuniqueness of the individual rather than conformance to a creed, and one thatultimately leads you to the understanding of your own innate divinity. Castingaside aeons of adherence to a social order dominated by the impossible gods ofsacrifice and restriction, Thelema represents a new age of spiritual developmentthat empowers us all to discover our True Self through the manifestation of ourTrue Will.“Success is thy proof: argue not, convert not, talk not overmuch!”—The Book of the Law, Chapter III, Verse 42[contents] [Contents.xhtml#_idTextAnchor000]"},{"pageContent":"Onion Peelings 2 [Thelema-1.xhtml#footnote-001]The Universe is the Practical Joke of the General at the Expense of theParticular, quoth Frater Perdurabo, and laughed.But those disciples nearest to him wept, seeing the Universal Sorrow.Those next to them laughed, seeing the Universal Joke.Below these certain disciples wept.Then certain laughed.Others next wept.Others next laughed.Next others wept.Next others laughed.Last came those who wept because they could not see the Joke, and those thatlaughed lest they should be thought not to see the Joke, and thought it safe toact like Frater Perdurabo.But though Frater Perdurabo laughed openly, He also at the same time weptsecretly; and in himself he neither laughed nor wept.Nor did he mean what he said.[contents] [Contents.xhtml#_idTextAnchor000]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------2.

From a life of privilege as thesole heir of his father’s fortune, to his death in penury after having spenteverything and then some in pursuit of his art, Crowley was—and is—an enigmatic,complex, and controversial figure. Much of the legend that has become Crowley’slegacy stems from sensational accounts fabricated to titillate the public—then,as now, eager for the first scent of scandal—but they also arise from many ofhis own writings. He reveled in his reputation, which he did little todiscourage when writing in metaphors that would shock even a modern reader notalready informed on the underlying meaning of his analogies.While both vilified and celebrated in his own lifetime and beyond, one finds inCrowley an exceptional man, yet a man not without his flaws, as one might expectof anyone who dares greatly. Yet this was part of the draw for me: Crowley theman in all his flawed humanity, and Crowley who had also ascended to the heights(and depths) of spiritual attainment. It speaks to the fact that spiritualattainment is not a point-event, a single moment in time where we areforever-after an enlightened being. We must inevitably come crashing back to ourearthly egos, though perhaps with a better command and control of it, and fightthe many forces that might pervert its best intentions.And it is with the best of intentions that we begin.Birth and Early ChildhoodBy his own account, Aleister Crowley was born on October 12, 1875, to Edward andEmily (Bishop) Crowley at 30 Clarendon Square in Leamington in Warwickshire,England, at about eleven at night. His given name was Edward, after his fatherand his father’s father, with a middle name of Alexander: hence, in full, EdwardAlexander Crowley. As a boy, he went by a shortened form of his middle name,Alick, a household convenience to differentiate him from his father. It wouldstill be some years before he donned the nom de plume—or is it nom de guerre?—ofAleister.Situated somewhat evenly between London and Birmingham, the bustling town ofLeamington Spa was renowned for its saline baths, the purported curative andrestorative properties being responsible for the surge in popularity andaffluence since its first bathhouse was opened to the public in 1786. AtClarendon Square, the Crowley home was one of the many fine Georgian-eratownhouses erected in the necessity of the town’s expansion, the population atthat time being approximately 25,000—no small borough for what was not longbefore simply a “farm on the river Leam,” from whence the town got its name.This bustling resort for England’s elite was young Alick’s home until he wasfive, at which point the family moved to Redhill, Surrey, a southern suburb ofgreater London.Crowley’s father was independently wealthy as a result of a very successfulfamily brewing business in Alton, to the southwest of London. He had foregonethis line of work, however, on the religious grounds of abstaining from alcohol,having taken up the faith of the evangelical Exclusive Plymouth Brethren. A sectbegun most notably by John Nelson Darby in the early part of the nineteenthcentury in rejection of the predominant Anglican Church, the Plymouth Brethrenbelieved not only that common people could take communion together, but thatscripture was to be interpreted as the ultimate authority: above tradition andcertainly above the political expediencies toward which the Anglican Church wasinclined in its relationship with the British government.Crowley notes with no small sense of admiration that his father, in trueevangelical style, would often go about town and casually engage people on thetopic of what they were planning to do that day, adding continually “ … andthen?” until such a point as they arrived at their inevitable death—which ofcourse would prompt the same question: “And then?” There was never a moresuccessful tool of promulgation than the fear of eternal hellfire, a fear thatlikely bore a heavier weight on the promulgator than his intended convert.Crowley is likely to have taken much from this memory of his father indeveloping his own spiritual philosophy, far removed as it may have been fromthe austerity of that religious sect. He commonly declared to friends andstrangers alike, “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law!” upon firstgreeting.Despite the Plymouth Brethren being exceedingly close-knit, forbidding evenassociation with individuals external to their religious group, Aleister wasafforded all the luxuries of his social class, including private tutors andboarding schools throughout his early education. Given the strong religiousleanings of his family, these were also staunchly evangelical, teaching all butexclusively from the Bible. Crowley claims no small happiness in this period,despite being at odds with the man we would come to know. Why would he not?Since he viewed his father as the “wealthy scion of a race of Quakers,” itseemed logical that he would be heir to no less a claim. Yet it was precisely atthis point, on the brink of manhood and with all the world before him, that hislife fell apart.Crowley was just eleven when his father was diagnosed with cancer of the tongue.4 [Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-056] The family ultimately decided on a treatmentapproach that is now understood as nothing more than medical quackery in lieu ofthe standard medical practice of the time, limited as it was. The decisionultimately proved fatal, something that Crowley never quite forgave. The deathof his father in March of 1887 left him to the care of his mother and herfamily, an arrangement that he came to despise. While Crowley idealized hisfather as a kind and rational man of religion, he saw his mother as little morethan an unthinking zealot, having been converted to the faith of his fatherrather than having arrived at it of her own accord. Where the father saw contextand adjustment, the mother saw only rules that were to be followed. Darker dayswere to come.The family inherited his father’s wealth, and Crowley continued to be educatedat private religious boarding schools, but seemingly one worse than the next inits fervor for discipline—a penchant for cruelty well-known in private schoolsat the time and exacerbated by the stern environment of religious extremism inwhich he was entrenched. Coupled with Crowley’s emotional lashing-out in thewake of his father’s death, it combined for many years of misery at what canreadily be described as the hands of sociopathic sadists armed with theunrelenting authority of a self-righteous religious fervor. It was a misery thathe would not soon forget, and equally served to forge the man that came to callhimself by a name his frustrated mother bestowed upon him: The Beast.Early AdulthoodIt was a difficult time for Crowley. The death of his father robbed him of hisassumed primacy in the familial order, the natural heir to his kingdom. Thisromantic ideal dashed, it had been replaced with the harsh reality that he wasthe seemingly unwanted chattel of his maternal family, the Bishops. As such, hewas now subject to the discretions of its patriarch, his uncle, Tom Bishop. Inhis Confessions, there is not a kind word levied toward his uncle, with severalparagraphs dedicated to his utter excoriation. Further undermining whatstability the young Crowley might have clung to, Tom Bishop convinced his motherto leave the family home in Surrey to be closer to her kin in the nearby suburbof Streatham.When away at school, things progressively worsened. In an atmosphere wheresalacious accusation was as good as proof, a gaggle of tattletales hungry toescape the lash is bred, lest they be implicated first. Having visited Crowleyat his parent’s home over the holidays, one boy returned to school with a talethat he had witnessed young Alick drunk. This was nonsense, but it didn’t matterto his particularly vicious headmaster, Reverend Champney. Crowley was placed“in Coventry,” a literal ostracism from his teachers and classmates, who wereforbidden to interact with him in any way until he confessed the crime and facedthe punishment. He refused to do so, being innocent of the crime—ignorant evenof the crime for which he had been accused!—and was left in such a state for aterm and half, having only bread and water on which to subsist. The result wasthat the already sickly child developed a severe case of albuminuria, apotentially fatal kidney disease. His family finally intervened and had himremoved from the school, which purportedly closed shortly thereafter as theresult of complaints from other parents as well.No small damage had been done: young Alick’s health was in shambles, and hisdoctors predicted he would not live to see adulthood. To counter this diagnosis,he was pulled from school altogether and placed in the care of private tutorsand given to travels across Scotland and Wales in the hopes that he mightrecover his vitality, a prescription that ultimately served him well. His healthgradually returned as he spent summers engaged in outdoor activities such asgolf, fishing, and mountain climbing—away from the stifling physical andintellectual confines of the boarding school. His newfound freedom was not acomplete victory, however, as his tutors were specifically chosen by his uncleunder the auspices of what Crowley termed his “extraordinarily narrow, ignorantand bigoted Evangelicalism … ” 5 [Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-055] He spent most ofhis time arranging ways to outwit them, often with great success. Crowley notes,“These persons … were not too satisfactory; they were all my Uncle Tom’snominees; that is, they were of the sawny, anaemic, priggish type, … Of course,I considered it my duty to outwit them in every possible way and hunt up somekind of sin.” 6 [Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-054]A timely savior would come in the guise of Archibald Douglas, after the latestline of tutors had given up on the boy. Not only could Crowley see Douglas as anintellectual equal, but his new tutor would assert to no small relief that thepleasures of the world could be both safely and morally engaged in, provided ofcourse that they did not cross into excess. Douglas’s relative moral leniencyprovided a much-needed breath of fresh air for a young man just then coming intohis adulthood, and the “sin” Crowley was all too quick to hunt up was exactlywhat you might expect of a young man in his later teens—and from the evangelicalpoint of view the most forbidden of fruits! He quips, “Here was certainly a sinworth sinning and I applied myself with characteristic vigour to its practice.”7 [Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-053] The discovery that sex, which until this pointhad been the most abominable and unmentionable of sins, was something that couldbe enjoyed and was in fact enjoyable was the first of many now seemingly obviousrevelations that set the young Crowley on his future path—with the willingassistance of several local girls, of course. Lesser vices such as drinking andsmoking quickly fell by the wayside in the wake of his triumph over this greatertransgression.Though it would have a great impact on him, the arrangement with Douglas wouldbe predictably short-lived. As soon as his mother and uncle got wind ofCrowley’s suspicious sense of happiness, they arrived on the scene and promptlydismissed Crowley’s latest tutor. Those who followed would suffer the same fateas those who preceded, either dismissed or dismayed at their inability tocontrol a young man who in retrospect seemed only to have wanted to be treatedas an equal.The remainder of Crowley’s school years fortunately found him in good health.This allowed him to return to boarding school, but this time at the lessoppressive schools of Malvern and Tonbridge, though still with the occasionaltutor to ensure a proper moral upbringing in the view of the Plymouth Brethren.He held the latter school, Tonbridge, in especial regard, largely in partbecause he had reached an age and fullness of health that prevented a great dealof the bullying he had endured elsewhere. He continued to fill his leisure timewith mountain climbing and other outdoor activities critical to maintaining hishealth, but it seemed that the dark days of his childhood were finally lifting.Aleister ArrivesIn 1895, Crowley entered Trinity College at Cambridge University at the heightof his newfound vitality, and shortly thereafter invested himself with the nameby which the world would come to know him: Aleister. The Gaelic derivative ofhis middle name, he chose it for reasons associated with his literaryaspirations, having read that “the most favourable name for becoming famous wasone consisting of a dactyl followed by a spondee … ” 8[Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-052] His cousin assured him (incorrectly) thatAleister was the appropriate spelling, rather than the more common rendering ofAlaisdair.The vast sum of his inheritance was now at his disposal, as well, held in trustuntil he had attained adulthood, and the freedom of university life seems tohave suited young Crowley well. He spent his time engaged in the debate club fora time, and excelling in the chess club, famously beating its club president intheir first match. However, these were but idle distractions to Crowley’s aim ofrepairing the manifold flaws in his religious education. The sparse readinglists of his puritanical upbringing left large gaps in his knowledge, and he wasdetermined to close them. There were entire classes of literature that neededattending to, and he delved headlong into that endeavor. Crowley spent much ofhis time reading classics instead of attending to his assigned classwork,importing books “by the ton.” 9 [Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-051]Now far from the oversight of his sternly religious household, he could alsomore freely engage in the sexual freedoms that he had only so recentlydiscovered. He notes in Confessions that “Every woman that I met enabled me toaffirm magically that I had defied the tyranny of the Plymouth Brethren.” 10[Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-050] As any individual might, his early and entirelynatural sexual appetite was tinged with the hallmark of his individuation: thatof rebellion against the experience of his childhood’s religious oppression.However, despite the burgeoning poet’s own grand gestures toward the concept ofromantic idealism, his so-called magical defiance did not appear to result inany lasting relationships. While he would have encounters with several women, itwas in fact a man by the name of Jerome Pollitt (1871–1942) 11[Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-049] who truly awakened his muse.Crowley the poet [image/crowley_poet.png]Crowley the poetSlightly older than Crowley, Pollitt, the equally well-to-do son of a newspaperpublisher, was pursuing his MA at Cambridge, but was locally notorious as afemale impersonator and dancer under the stage name Diane de Rougy. 12[Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-048] Meeting toward the end of the October term in1897, he introduced Crowley to the writings of Decadent authors such asBeardsley and Wilde, both of whom were friends. Crowley notes that it was thefirst “intimate friendship” of his life, 13 [Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-047] butit was of course much more than that. In Pollitt, Crowley would find his firstlove, and they would spend six months together. To Crowley’s eternal regret, itwas ultimately his magical aspirations that would cause him to break off therelationship. 14 [Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-046] It was a path that Pollittsimply could not follow, and a path that Crowley was already determined totread. Ultimately, the severance of the relationship was an unnecessary and rashdecision Crowley would regret for the rest of his life. An early volume ofCrowley’s forlorn poetry was rediscovered in 2014 dating to just after thebreakup and with obvious reference to his ex-lover. 15[Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-045] He notes having seen him once later in life butnot having had the courage to approach him.It was also in this period that he began writing poetry in earnest, his eyesnewly open to the greater scope of literature now available to him forinspiration, as opposed to the staid measure of religious verse. He publishedregularly in the school’s student publications, 16[Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-044] and he also published his first book of poetry,entitled Aceldama: A Place to Bury Strangers In. He published this anonymouslyas “A gentleman of the University of Cambridge” as a nod to one of his moreprevalent influences at the time, Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792–1822), whopublished using a similar phrasing while an undergraduate at Oxford. He wouldalso publish a compendium of erotic poetry, White Stains, under the pen name ofGeorge Archibald Bishop in 1898. 17 [Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-043] The lastname, Bishop, was certainly a jab at his mother’s family—but also British slangfor penis!Aside from his schoolwork and poetry, Crowley continued to pursue an interest inmountaineering. He was already a skilled climber, having scaled many ofBritain’s more difficult peaks, including the chalk cliffs at Beachy Head, oncethought unassailable. Time between semesters was now spent climbing moredifficult peaks across Europe. Later in life he would make ascents on the SwissAlps, and even K2, and while he would never make the guarded rolls of thehallowed Alpine Club, it was this passion that led him into contact with men whoheld connections to another of his interests, and one for which he wouldultimately become more famous: magick.Further ReadingThe Collected Works of Aleister CrowleyWhite StainsThe Dawn of the MagicianKarl von Eckartshausen’s The Cloud upon the Sanctuary, noted in a periodicaledited by occult scholar A. E. Waite, particularly caught Crowley’s attention. Awork of Christian esoteric philosophy, The Cloud upon the Sanctuary describes acommon theme in Western mystical literature: that our current state, based onego-perception and rationalization (the cloud), blinds us to the greaterinternal and spiritual perception that is the true source of all wisdom andintellect (the sanctuary). However, its pronouncement of a school of initiatesentrusted with the keys to this arcane science is what truly drew the youngCrowley in: “ … a more advanced school has always existed to whom thisdeposition of all science has been confided … ” 18[Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-042]If there was an invisible school of initiates, Crowley was determined to findit.The key to Crowley’s connection was Oscar Eckenstein, a man he met whileclimbing Wasdale Head during Easter of 1898. Shorter and of sturdier build,Eckenstein was twenty years older and significantly more disciplined in hisapproach to mountaineering, a welcome mentor to improve on Crowley’s self-taughtmethod. Crowley reflected that “His style was invariably clean, orderly andintelligible; mine can hardly be described as human.” 19[Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-041] Crowley was still a self-taught novice by anystandard, despite his accomplishments, and he would need greater training anddiscipline if he were to successfully tackle some of the more treacheroussummits he had in mind. He and Eckenstein spent the summer perfecting alpineclimbing techniques on the Schonbuhl glacier on the south side of the DentBlanche in the Swiss Alps.While poor weather and Crowley’s ever-precarious health kept them fromaccomplishing as much as they had hoped, Crowley had brought ample readingmaterial to pass the time. One of these was The Kabbalah Unveiled by S. L.MacGregor Mathers, to which Crowley asserts, “I didn’t understand a word of it,but it fascinated me all the more for that reason, and it was my constant studyon the glacier.” 20 [Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-040] Without yet knowing it, hehad encountered his future magical mentor by virtue of that work, as Mathers wasat this point the sole head of the Golden Dawn, a working magical order based inLondon. He appealed to the universe to deliver him a master, and he would soonfind one.Crowley eventually descended from the glacier to recuperate, finding himself ina discussion on alchemy with some of the locals and visiting climbers for whichthe town was a natural base of operations. It was through this conversation thathe met Julian Baker, an actual practitioner of alchemy, in contrast to Crowley’stheoretical knowledge of the subject. Alas, no search for a master comes easily,and he found that Baker had left when he arose the next morning, precisely whenCrowley hoped to press him on the topic of initiation. Crowley pursued, enduringone near miss after another until he finally caught up with Baker ten milesoutside of town. After Crowley confided in Baker of his search for a trueinitiatory school of magick, Baker promised to meet Crowley back in London wherehe could introduce him to a much greater magician than he. That man was GeorgeCecil Jones, in whom Crowley would find a friend and mentor for many years.Jones was finally someone Crowley could consider a true magician in everyrespect, and the man that introduced him to the body of initiates he sodesperately sought: The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.Formed as a conjunction of Christian Qabalah, Rosicrucianism, and Freemasonry,and dressed in Egyptian mythology, The Golden Dawn was the principal genius ofWilliam Wynn Westcott. 21 [Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-039] Westcott furtherenlisted his Rosicrucian compatriot, Dr. William Robert Woodman, who had acompatible interest and expertise in Qabalah. However, the strengths of thesetwo men were primarily academic: it was the third individual, S. L. MacGregorMathers, who would develop this academic knowledge, in concert with his own,into an active initiatory order.Each of these men were members of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia (SRIA),itself a Rosicrucian reconstructionist order as the name indicates. Woodman,Westcott, and Mathers expanded the Rosicrucian mystical teachings of the SRIAinto a functional magical order by 1888 with the opening of the Isis-UraniaTemple in London. The order’s initiatory system was based on a set of “ciphermanuscripts” that alleged to show the skeleton of the ritual frameworks, andgave them charter to open the school from certain continental adepts—a claimthat is now generally regarded as having been fabricated in an attempt to derivean air of legitimacy for the fledgling cabal. As members worked through thedegrees of the order, they would be presented more information surrounding thepractice of Western occultism, augmented somewhat liberally with a syncretic mixof Eastern tattwa symbolism, chakras, and similar practices that were then (astoday) of fashionable interest to spiritual seekers. In contrast to the Masonicorganizations, including the SRIA, to which the men belonged, this order wouldbe open to both men and women, ultimately counting among its membership suchluminaries as occult author and historian A. E. Waite, poet W. B. Yeats, andArthur Machen, an early writer of occult and supernatural horror. By the timeCrowley arrived, Woodman had passed, and Westcott had been forced to withdraw,given his public position and political standing as the official coroner forLondon; his esoteric pursuits were untenable. Mathers was now the last remainingfounder and sole head of the Golden Dawn.The not-yet-famous Aleister Crowley joined the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawnin 1898, undergoing its neophyte initiation ritual in October of that year. Onecan imagine his excitement upon entering the antechamber of the London temple,finally crossing the threshold of the initiatory brotherhood he had desired toenter for so long. Once arrived, he was instructed to put on the long black robeand red slippers he obtained for the purpose and wait silently. A man dressed ina white robe and holding a scepter would eventually emerge from the western endof the main temple, accompanied by a sentinel in black. Crowley was blindfoldedand bound by a rope wrapped three times about his waist before the imposingfigure in white knocked once upon the entry door and lead him blindly forwardinto the adventure he had so fervently sought.A look at the initial knowledge lectures of the Golden Dawn shows why Crowley’senthusiasm was immediately dampened. For a man that had been seeking a trueinitiation while studying the depth and breadth of occult writings for severalyears, being handed “secret” documents that discussed trivial curricula such asthe four elements, the seven planets, the twelve signs of the zodiac, and theHebrew alphabet—all readily available information and certainly well-known byhim—left the experience somewhat flat after the exhilaration and grandeur of theadmittedly remarkable neophyte initiation.Not all was lost, however. The Golden Dawn proved exceedingly fruitful indeveloping Crowley’s skill and knowledge in Qabalah, a Jewish mystical traditionthat had long since been segregated and evolved separately as part of thedevelopment of Christian magical practices during the Renaissance. This practicehad been at the philosophical heart of ceremonial magick in Europe forcenturies, so it is no surprise to find it at the heart of one of the mostsuccessful magical orders to date, though further augmented through theextensive associative and comparative symbology of the Order. It ultimatelybecame the framework and symbol-set through which Crowley would express thesublimities of his philosophies and ideas. It is in fact exceedingly difficultto understand Crowley without understanding the Qabalah, as much of his thoughtprocess was built on its manifold connections and analogies. Despite his initialdisappointments, and with encouragement from Jones and others, he pressed on andquickly attained each of the degrees of the Golden Dawn’s instructive outerorder by May of the following year.It was also within the Golden Dawn that he met one of his greatest influences,Allan Bennett. After attending a seasonal ritual at the temple, he wasapproached by the then-unknown-to-him Bennett, who famously declared, “Littlebrother, you have been meddling with the Goetia!” The Goetia is one of thebest-known manuscripts on conjuring evil spirits, and Crowley denied it,prompting Bennett’s response, “Then the Goetia has been meddling with you!”Crowley, of course, had been meddling with the Goetia, and he and Bennett wouldsoon become fast friends. It was equally rumored, with reasonable cause, thatthey were lovers.Crowley would rent two rooms, one for himself and the other for the impoverishedBennett, arranged such that the two could study magick together—Bennett beingthe more experienced of the two. Like Crowley, Bennett was also an asthmatic andcycled through a number of medicines to help him maintain his health. Given thatthis was turn-of-the-twentieth-century prescription medicine, this meant cocaineand opiates, among others, all of which were commonly available through aphysician if not simply purchased over the counter. Thus, along with experimentswith more traditional magical practices, they began experimenting withdrug-induced states of altered consciousness as well. This was much more thansimple drug use: it was true experimentation in the vein of Huxley, methodicaland precise, and a systematic study that Crowley pursued throughout his life.Fitting with how they first met, Bennett and Crowley soon used Goetia to speedthe ailing Bennett to the warmer climates of Ceylon, now known as Sri Lanka, inorder to combat his worsening asthma.Coincidental with the departure of his friend and mentor, however, he would findthat the Order to which he had pledged his hopes was starting to come undone. S.L. MacGregor Mathers recused himself to Paris, leaving the confines of theLondon temples of the Golden Dawn in order to further establish his relationshipwith the “Secret Chiefs” and advance the higher degrees of the Order. This leftLondon in the hands of higher adepts that did not look as favorably or lenientlyon Crowley’s lifestyle, especially the rumors of his homosexuality. It ispossible that jealousy of Mathers’s new star pupil had an influence, as well.When Crowley applied to the London office for his due advancement to the innerorder of the Golden Dawn, he was denied. No reasons were given. He was simplynot the sort of person that the London initiates wanted to be associated with.Undaunted, Crowley again left for Paris, where upon petition Mathers conferredto him the degree he sought, admitting him to ranks of the Second Order. Thiswas where Crowley had been told the real secrets were kept, the very magicalsecrets he had pursued since his days at Cambridge. Returning to London, hedemanded the papers to which he was now entitled, but was once more rebuffed.The Order was splintering along the lines of Mathers’s authority in London andspeculation about the validity of the famed cipher documents that purported togive the Order legitimacy in the first place. A bitter fight would ensue,effectively destroying the Golden Dawn until it was resurrected some decadeslater, but Crowley was on his way.Further ReadingThe Cloud upon the Sanctuary by Karl von EckartshausenThe Golden Dawn by Israel RegardieThe Mystical Qabalah by Dion FortuneThe Goetia by Aleister CrowleyMr. & Mrs. CrowleyCrowley met a young Gerald Kelly at Cambridge in May of 1898 after the latterhad picked up a copy of his poem Aceldama and determined to meet the authorbased on his “Gentleman of the University of Cambridge” homage, being an admirerof Shelley as well. They would strike up a strong friendship that endured for agreat many years, but most importantly it was through his new friend that hewould meet Kelly’s sister Rose, his future wife.Crowley’s wife, Rose Kelly [image/CrowleyRose.png]Crowley’s wife, Rose KellyCrowley had returned to his recently purchased highland estate, Boleskine, onthe shores of Loch Ness in Scotland after spending some time on the Europeancontinent. He received word that Gerald would be visiting nearby, along with hismother, his sister, and her fiancé, and he naturally rushed to meet him. Findinghimself alone with Gerald’s sister Rose while the other men played golf, havingnot brought his clubs, Rose confessed that although she was betrothed, she didnot love her fiancé—nor the other man that she had agreed to marry! Moreover,she was in love with yet another man who was already married, but her parentswere insisting she marry one of her two suitors. It did not take long forCrowley to determine the obvious course of action: to avoid such a lovelessfate, she should marry him! As a marriage of convenience, she would then be freeto take up the residence the (married) man she loved had set aside for herwithout further interference. Gerald, when told, naturally thought theiroutlandish scheme was a joke.That same day, Crowley enquired of the local parish priest as to whether theycould be married on the spot, a request the clergyman flatly rejected on thefeeble grounds that they would not be able to publish the marriage banns—publicannouncements of the wedding. When Crowley pressed—which is to say, “pressed ashilling into his hand”—the priest admitted that the town constable could makeall the arrangements without delay. Rising early the next day, the two made itinto town at the break of dawn, only to be told that the sheriff might not beavailable until ten o’clock or later. This was not going to suffice given therequired expediency, and so they were directed to a local lawyer instead. Thus,on August 12, 1903, the two became legally married just before Rose’s brotherGerald broke through the door in a flurry of fists. Her brother, and in fact herwhole family, was incensed and tried to have it annulled, but unfortunately forthem it was all perfectly legal. The two set out on their “honeymoon” shortlythereafter to a small resort town in Scotland to give everything an air oflegitimacy, though neither at that time considered the arrangement anything morethan a measure of expediency. However, by the time they returned, both foundthemselves in love with the other, and if the start of their relationship wassurrounded with such drama, things were only going to get more interesting.Left to right: Rose, Lola (daughter), and Crowley, circa 1910 [image/family.png]Left to right: Rose, Lola (daughter),and Crowley, circa 1910The Equinox of the GodsNow in love, and ever the romantic idealist, Crowley soon designed a honeymoontour more befitting of their status, one that would take them to Italy and Cairobefore continuing to Ceylon (modern Sri Lanka) and China. By late January, theymade their way back to Cairo by way of Suez and Port Said, arriving in Cairo onthe ninth of February before moving on to the health resorts of Helwan to thesouth and registering under the assumed names of Choia Khan and Ouarda, meaning“The Great Beast” and “Rose” in Hebrew and Arabic, respectively. 22[Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-038] He was amused at his obviously fake name, but hewas equally interested in studying Islam from within, as Burton 23[Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-037] had done. He notes, “ … I got a sheikh to teachme Arabic and the practices of ablution, prayer, and so on, so that at somefuture time I might pass for a Moslem amongst themselves. I had it in mind torepeat Burton’s journey to Mecca sooner or later.” 24[Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-036]Now almost certain of it, the couple suspected that Rose was pregnant, andBoleskine was cold and dreary in the midst of the Scottish winter. Why not waita month or two until the weather improved? The fair weather of the highlandswould arrive just as the heat of Cairo became unbearable, so the decision tostay seemed obvious. (Despite its reputation for substandard sanitation, Cairoremained recommended for its desert climate and a fashionable place for theEuropean elite to winter, especially those with breathing problems like theasthmatic Crowley.) Leaving Helwan on or about the twelfth of March, theyreturned north to Cairo proper and rented a furnished ground-floor apartmentnear the Boulak Museum in a quarter Crowley described as “fashionably European.”25 [Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-035]Despite being “weary of Mysticism and dissatisfied with Magick,” 26[Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-034] on March 16, the couple took occasion to visitthe pyramids and for Crowley to demonstrate some of the magical practices thathe had learned, endeavoring to show his bride the sylphs—elemental spirits ofthe air—in the King’s Chamber of the Great Pyramid at Giza. To Crowley’saccount, the conjuration was a stunning success, illuminating the chamber by thelight of his invocation, but it had a very curious aftereffect. Rose could notsee the elemental spirits, but she became hysterical, saying, “They are waitingfor you!” Crowley had no idea what she meant.The following day, he repeated the same invocation, and she persisted, saying,“It is all about the child” and “All Osiris.” Half annoyed and half intrigued,he determined to sort out this conundrum by invoking the Egyptian god ofknowledge, Thoth, for more insight. This invocation was successful, and he madea note that “Thoth, with great success, indwells us.” 27[Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-033] However, for his efforts, he seems to havereceived no further illumination on the matter, nor indication of the purpose ofRose’s continued insistence.He turned his focus back to Rose the following day, and decided to determinewhether her visions were some form of hysteria due to her pregnancy or,alternately, the effects of alcohol. 28 [Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-032] Sheresponded by saying that Crowley had offended the Egyptian god Horus, and thatit was this deity attempting to contact him. How could she know this? How couldshe even know the name Horus, unless she had picked it up somehow at randomwhile in the city? Skeptical, he put a number of very technical questions to herregarding the identity of whom she was in contact with, questions that she couldnot know given a lack of education in both Egyptology and magical practice, muchless the attributions defined by the Golden Dawn on which Crowley was to rely.Crowley asked first about the god’s nature, “What are his moral qualities?”“Force and fire,” she replied, correctly.“What conditions are caused by his presence?”“A deep blue light,” she said. Again, correct, but equally plausible for anumber of others.Crowley had yet to reveal that he had determined the god to be Horus, so hewrote that name amidst a number of others chosen at random. “Pick a name.”She pointed to Horus, the same god that had been indicated to Crowley.“Who is his enemy?”She answered, “The forces of the water … of the Nile.”Remarkable. Set, the brother and murderer of his brother Osiris, was the Nilegod who was ultimately avenged by Horus!Still, more technical questions were offered. He asked about his lineal figureand color, and she responded correctly, a probability of eighty-four to one. Sheanswered his place in the temple of the Golden Dawn. She picked the magicalweapon with which he was associated from a list of six, his planetary naturefrom a list of the seven ancient planets, his principal number (one throughten), and from a number of arbitrary symbols. In total, absent the open-endedquestions where the odds were impossible to calculate, roughly half of them, shehad answered each perfectly, with Crowley estimating the odds at no less thantwenty-one million to one against. He was forced to take notice.As a final test, Crowley ventured to take Rose to the museum, where she had yetto visit, so that she could show him an image of the god she claimed to see.Still skeptical, Crowley found himself amused when she walked past severaldepictions of Horus, and began their journey to the second floor of the museum.In the distance was a glass case, which she pointed to. “There! There he is!”Rushing forward, as the contents were too far away to see with any clarity, hewas dumbfounded when in the case stood an image of Horus in the form ofRa-Hoor-Khuit, an amalgamation of that god and the principal solar god Ra, on awooden funeral stele 29 [Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-031] of the Twenty-sixthDynasty for the priest Ankh-af-na-Khonsu—in an exhibit numbered six hundred andsixty-six, no less! One would think that The Beast had found his calling, buthis Confessions depicts otherwise, noting that he “dismissed it as an obviouscoincidence.” 30 [Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-030] This new calling was at odds,after all, with his stubborn and professed disillusionment with magick.Nonetheless, on March 19, he prepared an invocation and recited it underinstructions from Rose, instructions that went against every ounce of magicaltraining he had ever encountered. Wearing a white robe and opening the windowsof his ground-floor apartment at half past noon into the streets of the bustlingcity, he proceeded to shout his invocation of the god Horus into the bustlingthrongs of people making their way through the crowds of mid-day Cairo. Theinvocation was met with little success, but he was now less resistant to theidea than before. Perhaps being understandably self-conscious, he asked whetherhe might manage the invocation at night, which was begrudgingly accepted by Roseand the ethereal voice that guided her. On March 20, at midnight, he began anew,and this time his invocation was a success, with Crowley learning that the“Equinox of the Gods” had begun—a time of massive cultural transition from thepaternal age of Osiris, characterized by the major religious themes of thepreceding two thousand years, to that of the individualistic Crowned andConquering Child, and son of Osiris, Horus. As the ritual concluded on thespring equinox and start of the astrological new year, Crowley found himselfwith a monumental task: “I am to formulate a new link of an Order with the SolarForce.” 31 [Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-029] But how? What did that mean?In the following weeks, Crowley had the verses of the stele translated intoFrench by the assistant curator at the museum, a translation he would laterinterpret into English poetic verse. He would also work through variousQabalistic analyses of the information he had gathered so far. Finally, on April7, Rose told Crowley to enter the room they had been using as a temple for thenext three successive days and write down what he would hear. No longerpermitted to be the skeptic given the events of the last three weeks, Crowleydid as he was told. He notes: “I went into the ‘temple’ a minute early, so as toshut the door and sit down on the stroke of Noon. On my table were my pen—a SwanFountain—and supplies of Quarto typewriting paper, 8\" × 10\". I never lookedround in the room at any time.” 32 [Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-028]At the stroke of noon, he heard the voice of Aiwass, the “praeternatural entity”that Rose had indicated, who then dictated The Book of the Law. The voice camefrom behind his left shoulder and possessed a “deep timbre, musical andexpressive, its tones solemn, voluptuous, tender, fierce or aught else as suitedto the moods of the message. Not bass—perhaps a rich tenor or baritone.” 33[Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-027] It began, as Crowley rushed to keep pen to paper,“Had! The manifestation of Nuit. The unveiling of the company of Heaven. Everyman and every woman is a star … ” 34 [Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-026] The pace washurried, as evidenced by the writing and volume inscribed within the span of asingle hour, and so it would be over the course of the three days.The result of his efforts would be The Book of the Law, 35[Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-025] a three-chapter text spanning sixty-fivehandwritten pages that Crowley (and many others) claimed were much more thansimple automatic writing. The myriad complexities of the work are too great toenter into here, or arguably anywhere, but at heart it presented a new spirituallaw for humanity. An inversion of the prior age, where suffering and deprivationwere the key to spiritual attainment, this law was markedly individualist. Itscentral tenet was “Do what thou wilt,” which was not a call to hedonism, butrather a call to personal accountability in the establishment of—and adherenceto—one’s own moral code. Coupled with intricate esoteric puzzles in support ofits authenticity, this book would come to dominate the remainder of Crowley’slife and spiritual teachings … after a spell.With all of the events leading up to the reception of The Book of the Law, aswell as the circumstances in its actual reception, one would think that Crowleymight have taken a stronger and more immediate interest in its study andexegesis. However, Crowley was still quite stubbornly done with magick, havingonly a passing interest in the practice of raja yoga. While he spent someinitial effort in the thought of announcing the work, after his ultimatedisappointment in Mathers and the Golden Dawn to deliver the initiatoryexperience he so desperately sought, he was burned out. His plans were totravel, climb mountains, and otherwise spend his days at Boleskine as a man ofleisure, and his mind was set to it. It would be some time yet before Crowleystumbled across the manuscript again while retrieving a pair of skis from hisattic, but this time his curiosity would hold—and his adventure would begin inearnest.Further ReadingThe Book of the LawThe Equinox of the GodsThe Magus and the EquinoxNow back at Boleskine, the Crowleys’ only work, aside from the arrangement ofsome publishing matters, was to await the birth of their child, and so it wasthat on July 28, 1904, a baby girl by the name Nuit Ma Ahathoor Hecate SapphoJezebel Lilith Crowley was born. She would go by Lilith for short, and Crowleywould find himself truly at home in the Scottish Highlands of Boleskine. TheCairo experience set aside, he notes, “I was bitterly opposed to the principlesof The Book [of the Law] on almost every point of morality. The third chapterseemed to me gratuitously atrocious.” 36 [Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-024]His other publishing efforts went into full swing, however, taking back hisstock from what he believed was the underperforming sales of his presentbookseller into his own hands and new imprint: The Society for the Propagationof Religious Truth. “My responsibility to the gods was to write as I wasinspired; my responsibility to mankind was to publish what I wrote.” 37[Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-023] It was through this new label that he wouldrelease some of his most compelling early works, including among others his wellreceived The Sword of Song, his Collected Works of poetry to date (in threevolumes!), and his edition of the infamous grimoire Goetia, which he hadcollected from the offices of the Golden Dawn some years ago during thatdramatic period. 38 [Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-022]Though he counted these days as extremely happy, the arrival of one of hisformer climbing associates as a guest of the house brought back a reverie of themisfortunes of his failed attempt on K2. Crowley would be convinced to join anexpedition to summit the third highest mountain in the world, Kangchenjunga,high in the Himalayas and as yet unconquered. (His friend and mentor OscarEckenstein declined to join the party.) It was already April, however, whichmeant the assault would need to come together quickly, if not immediately.Crowley departed for the excursion on May 6, just two weeks after his friend’svisit, leaving wife and child behind with the family and attendant nurses.While the preparations came together as well as might be expected given theexpediency, the expedition up the mountain proved disastrous—and for an unluckyfew, deadly. Striking out from the local village at the base of the mountains inlate August, Crowley led their ascent across the treacherous glacial terrain,but by their fourth base camp at nearly twenty thousand feet, the porters werealready deserting—another falling to his death as he chose to go off by himself.The party itself appears to have been composed of too many inexperiencedclimbers for the sort of ascent they were attempting, with logisticaldifficulties throughout their climb as well, which can prove the untimely end ofa climbing party in and of itself.Crowley (center) and company on the ill-fated expedition [image/k2.png]Crowley (center) and company on the ill-fated expeditionOn the first of September, disaster struck in the form of a small avalanche, notuncommon on the mountain, and something they had already encountered. However,this time, the loose and fast-moving snow took with it a principal member oftheir party, Alexis Pache, as well as three of their porters. Two other membersof the team, Tartarin and de Righi, were also injured in the accident, and itwas clear that they could not, or would not, go on. Though surpassing twenty-twothousand vertical feet of the total twenty-eight thousand, the deadly slopes ofKangchenjunga would have their way, and Crowley and his expedition never setfoot upon its peak. The expedition was broken, and they had little recourse butto descend the mountain. A cairn, known even today as “Pache’s grave,” waserected at the base camp on the Yulong glacier in memoriam. The mountain wouldnot be bested for another fifty years.Dejected, Crowley departed the shadow of the mountain for Rangoon, in what isnow Myanmar, and then on to travels across South Asia, where Rose and youngLilith joined him through the end of the winter. While the travel was oftenrough and inhospitable compared to travels in Europe, the three appear to havetraveled quite well, eventually making their way to the port of Hai Phong on theGulf of Tonkin, some forty miles east of Hanoi, Vietnam. There, after a briefstay, they boarded a ship for Hong Kong, where they decided to travel homewardby different routes: Rose, now pregnant once more, through India to pick up someof their belongings, and Crowley across the Pacific and through North America,sailing on April 21, 1906. Landing in Vancouver, British Columbia, some twelvedays later, he remarked at the time that it presented “ … no interest to thecasual visitor.” 39 [Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-021] He traveled across lowerCanada through Calgary and Toronto, then crossed into the United States atNiagara to see the Falls and New York City. Ten days in the great metropolis wasplenty, and so he set sail for England, arriving in Bournemouth where his mailawaited with devastating news: his daughter Lilith was dead, having caughttyphoid fever during the return trip with Rose. 40[Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-020] Crowley suffered further misfortunes with hishealth for the remainder of the year, including several operations of varyingsuccess. He remained bedridden for much of the last part of the year, which inits own way rekindled his interest in magick: he put down the set ofcorrespondences he had learned in the Golden Dawn, greatly expanding it with hisown researches, resulting in his classic Liber 777, though that work would notbe released for another two years’ time.During his travels across Asia following the climbing expedition, he re-engagedwith magical practice and made consistent progress. He also became impressedwith the idea that his spate of misfortunes resulted from ignoring the task ofdelivering on the promise of The Book of the Law and for not taking up the taskthat the gods had set before him. He therefore set before himself the task ofundertaking the Abramelin Operation once more, repeating his oath before his oldfriend George Cecil Jones to attain the Knowledge and Conversation of his HolyGuardian Angel, culminating in mid-October of that year.While the latter half of 1906 was difficult for Crowley, Rose had gone from badto worse. Likely spurned by the loss of her child, and doubtless aided by herhusband’s consistent absences, she took to drinking heavily. Their second child,another girl whom they named Lola Zaza, was born premature as a result andbarely moved for the first few days of her life, despite the care of theirdoctors. Crowley notes that he learned his wife purchased 150 bottles of whiskeyin just five months—and that was just from one of the grocers. She agreed tocounseling, but it did not stick, and she was back to heavy drinking within afortnight, making their relationship impossible. They ultimately divorced in1909, though they remained in contact, even being photographed together shortlyafter the final divorce decree. Crowley could no longer be responsible for herself-destruction, and unabated, she was committed to an asylum in 1911. Theywould not reunite before her death in 1932.The marriage now passed, Crowley understood that his reception of The Book ofthe Law placed him in a unique position to reformulate magick on the grounds ofa New Aeon, but he had much work to do in order to lay a legitimate claim. Toadvance his work, he had to complete the task for which Mathers had leftEngland: to make contact with the “Secret Chiefs,” the invisible adepts hebelieved had forever guided humanity toward enlightenment. His prior work hadprepared him well, and he had begun taking in students.The dissolution of the Golden Dawn had left a vacuum for those seekersinterested in the initiatory systems of magick and mysticism that Crowley hadbecome so intimately acquainted with, and Crowley found himself with a renewedvigor to carry out the work that he had so long set himself to. As a vehicle forthose teachings, he determined to create the magical order that he had sought injoining the Golden Dawn, expressed so captivatingly in Eckartshausen’s The Cloudupon the Sanctuary. This order would be called the Argenteum Astrum (A[image/2.jpg] A [image/2.jpg] ), Latin for Silver Star.The A [image/6.png] A [image/6.png] was announced through a newsubscription-based periodical of Crowley’s own design, entitled The Equinox. Itwas offered on the equinoxes of each year and contained a number of articles,short stories, and allegorical poems. Its initial release in the spring of 1909also contained all the previously unpublished Golden Dawn rituals in Crowley’spossession, his way of cementing the demise of that organization and his formermentor, Mathers, by removing the veils of its secrecy. The publication of theserituals ultimately lead to a very public lawsuit between the two men in whichCrowley emerged victorious. The Equinox continued with increased publicity fromnews coverage of the trial, with the tenth and final number in the first volumebeing issued in the fall of 1913.Despite the tragedies he endured, this was an exceptionally fertile period forCrowley, writing not only the bulk of Equinox, but many inspired works thatwould be issued later as the three volumes of Thelema, now commonly referencedas The Holy Books of Thelema. Written between 1907 and 1911 while in a state ofecstatic trance, these works were intended to transmit the Logos of the Aeon,the essential spiritual concepts of Thelema. While The Book of the Law holds anespecial place within the scope of these works, the remaining holy books may beconsidered equally enlightening, and he included them as required reading in hiscurriculum for the A [image/6.png] A [image/6.png] . Crowley especially favoredLiber Cordis Cincti Serpente and Liber Liberi vel Lapidis Lazuli, assigning themas required reading in two of the earliest grades in his fledgling order.Further ReadingThe Holy Books of ThelemaThe Equinox, Volume 1, Numbers 1–10The Temple of the EastWhile the publicity from the trial against Mathers over The Equinox brought himinto contact with several esoteric groups claiming (or seeking) authority insuch matters, he claims to have turned them all away. The initial surge of thoseinterested would soon ebb to a predictable trickle of new membership. However,Crowley had established a set of London offices for the publication, and therebythe Order, through which he met his next “Scarlet Woman,” a term he adopted forhis sex magick partners to compliment his identification as The Beast. This wasAustralian violinist Leila Waddell, to whom he referred as Laylah, meaning“night” in both Arabic and Hebrew.Arguably one of Crowley’s most profound works, The Book of Lies was published in1912, containing ninety-three short mystical aphorisms—the first chapterconsisting merely of a question mark and an exclamation point. The book was sonamed because that which could be communicated was in and of itself subject toboth the bias of the communicator and the bias of the communicant with respectto their relative, subjective experiences. Hence, anything he could write onsuch mystical subjects was inherently corrupted by the limitations of languageand its inability to adequately communicate meaning. The text stated the onlything that could be believed of The Book of Lies was its imprint date, which ofcourse was deliberately incorrect, stating 1913 rather than 1912.The individual chapters vary greatly in both content and length, but nothinglonger than a page or two. Chapters 25 and 36 show Crowley’s early revisions ofthe Golden Dawn pentagram and hexagram rituals as the Star Ruby and StarSapphire, respectively, those chapter numbers being the squares of five and six.Chapter 69, “The Way to Succeed—and the Way to Suck Eggs!” requires a note thatit can only be deciphered by experts in English puns, where the entire chapteralludes outwardly to oral sex and yet still inwardly to a profound note on thepractice of sex magick. Chapter 77, bearing the same number as the Hebrew wordfor goat, OZ, contains nothing but the word “Laylah,” also enumerating to 77,and a picture of Leila Waddell, nude from the waist up, with her long black haircovering her breasts—all of which may be connected with the idea of the SabbaticGoat of witches’ lore. He notes in his Confessions that The Book of Liesrepresented a “compendium of the contents of my consciousness,” 41[Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-019] and those contents would bring an interestingknock on Crowley’s door not soon after publication.“You have published the secret!” declared the native German from under his thickmustache. The man at the door was none other than Theodor Reuss, the head of theOrdo Templi Orientis, a Masonic order whose higher degree rituals encodedspecific instructions on sexual magick. 42 [Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-018]Crowley was incredulous, or so he claims, and declared he had done no suchthing. Undaunted, Reuss pulled out a copy of The Book of Lies and rifled throughits pages until he found chapter 36, titled “The Star Sapphire.” Confronted withits overtly sexual symbolism, which speaks in veiled allegory about a sexual actin describing “the real and perfect Ritual of the Hexagram,” 43[Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-017] Crowley was taken aback. He was not surprised bythe sexuality, which was quite intentional, but the idea that it spoke to theunderlying symbolism of all Masonry had not occurred to him. “It instantlyflashed upon me. The entire symbolism, not only of freemasonry but of many othertraditions, blazed upon my spiritual vision. From that moment, the O.T.O.assumed its proper importance in my mind.” 44 [Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-016]Thus began Crowley’s involvement in Ordo Templi Orientis. Originally envisionedas an initiatory school for high-ranking Masons, its teachings regarding thesecrets of sexual magick became a practice with which Crowley became nearlysynonymous. His discussions with Reuss lead Crowley to join the Order andeventually preside over all English-speaking countries during Reuss’s lifetime.Crowley soon set himself to work in reforming the rituals of the O.T.O. alongThelemic lines, producing what is considered by many initiates of that order tobe Crowley’s true masterwork and legacy. He assumed full responsibility for theOrder after Reuss’s death in 1923.Along with the O.T.O., Reuss also had authority in L’Église CatholiqueGnostique, the Gnostic Catholic Church. Founded in France in 1907 as an offshootof an earlier incarnation founded by Jules Doinel, the church was established byJean Bricaud, Louis-Sophrone Fugairon, and Gérard Encausse, the latter of whomwrote a number of esoteric works more famously under the name Papus. At a 1908conference for Spiritualist Masonic orders organized by Encausse, he and Reusswould exchange rights for Reuss to operate within L’Église Catholique Gnostiqueand Encausse to have authority in Reuss’s Masonic Rites of Memphis and Mizraim.Reuss collected this religious organization into the catalogue of his own O.T.O.Unsurprisingly, the underlying theological foundation of L’Église CatholiqueGnostique was decidedly Christian, which of course would not do for Crowley.With authority over the church by virtue of his position in O.T.O., Crowleyfirst wrote and then installed his own Gnostic Mass as “the central public andprivate ritual of the O.T.O.” and renamed the church after the Latin equivalent:Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica (E.G.C.).Crowley in Masonic regalia [image/mason.jpg]Crowley in Masonic regaliaWritten in 1913 while in Moscow, the Gnostic Mass provides a symbolicrepresentation in ritual form of the O.T.O.’s innermost secret in Thelemicsymbolism, the same secret that brought Reuss knocking on Crowley’s door a yearearlier following the publication of The Book of Lies. The Gnostic Mass is nowperformed under the auspices of the E.G.C. by O.T.O. bodies around the world.Further ReadingThe Book of LiesThe Gnostic MassThe Great War and the Great Work“ … I cannot but conclude that at least for a long period anarchy will triumphin Europe.” 45 [Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-015]When Archduke Ferdinand was assassinated on June 28, 1914, it sparked a dominoeffect of treaty alliances drawn up for and against one country and another thatwould ultimately lead to the advent of the Great War, embroiling nearly everydeveloped nation into a conflict that resulted in over thirty-eight millioncasualties, including seventeen million deaths. Crowley was disgusted, laterreferring to it as “the culmination of [Europe’s] many centuries of corruptionby Christianity,” 46 [Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-014] and citing cheap newspapersas having turned his countrymen into a hysterical mob. His native England was ofcourse deeply involved, and despite his distaste for the circumstances thatbrought it about, Crowley was determined to help. To his mind, he was, first andforemost, an English gentleman, bound by honor to king and country. He madeseveral attempts to contact the British government with offers of his service,none of which bore fruit. His reputation as both an eccentric magician and allthe resultant salacious press surrounding his earlier court trials (and likelyhis suspect homosexuality) preceded him, and an attack of phlebitis—inflammationof the veins caused by blood clots—made impossible any more strenuous duties forthe man now approaching forty. He would lament that “My leg and my Sunday Schoolrecord alike” would conspire to keep him out of the war effort directly. 47[Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-013]That desire dashed, Crowley instead set his sails for America on an invitationto New York, sailing on the Lusitania, the same ship sunk by German U-boats inMay of the following year, which served as an initial catalyst for America’seventual entry into the Great War. He hoped to sell some of his publications toa wealthy collector, but when there was a delay in receiving his shipped works,he found himself with a little time to spare. While on a bus traveling throughNew York’s glitzy Fifth Avenue in early 1915, described as “a sort of ditchlined with diamonds and over-rouged stenographers,” 48[Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-012] he was approached by a man enquiring of his viewson Germany and Austria. Not wanting to tip his hand either way, he replied inrelative sympathy, and was given a card that led to the offices of TheFatherland, a German propaganda paper run by George Viereck.Seeing an opportunity to serve his country after all, Crowley played thesympathizer to the German cause with the angle of an Irish rebel and beganwriting for The Fatherland. The Sinn Fein movement had formed in opposition toBritain and provided the perfect cover of Irish nationalism under which Crowleycould operate, tracing his own name back to Irish ancestry from O’Crowley and deQuérouaille. True to form, he made a show of it, burning an envelope purportedto contain his British passport before the Statue of Liberty, thereafterhoisting the Irish flag while a violinist played “The Wearing of the Green.” Thespectacle would end up in The New York Times, along with the expected coveragein The Fatherland.Crowley would begin writing ostensibly pro-German propaganda, but while hisinitial offerings were somewhat staid, his prose gradually gave way to the mostlurid fanaticism designed to make the cause look patently absurd. While it wouldbe an exceptional hyperbole to suggest that Crowley was the cause of America’sentering the war, natural alliances and German use of unrestricted submarinewarfare serving well enough to sway the public, it is interesting to note he hada part in hampering the German propaganda efforts in New York, one of thelargest German population centers in America. While not officially sanctioned,he did have a friend in British Naval Intelligence who was aware of his work,and he would find his eventual repatriation curiously unobstructed.While in New York, he also met popular astrologer Evangeline Adams, a distantrelative of the former US presidents of the same name, who had made her own namethrough a very lucrative mail-order astrology business. Defending her practicein a number of court cases against accusations of fraudulent practice, she wassuccessful in all of them, paving the way for much of modern-day popularastrology—even to the publication of daily horoscopes in the papers. Among thenation’s elite, she would count among her clientele such notable persons asfinancier J. P. Morgan. There was only one trouble: as far as Crowley couldtell, she had no idea how astrology worked at all.Crowley agreed to ghostwrite a work on astrology for Adams, with his own idea toset astrology on a firm and rational scientific basis firmly in mind. He wasstill writing false propaganda pieces for The Fatherland as well as lighterarticles and poetry for Vanity Fair, but as time passed he’d made less progressthan he had hoped on Adams’s work. When the attractions of the city were foundto be too distracting to make significant progress, at least from Adams’sperspective, she offered Crowley the use of her cabin on the secluded shores ofNewfound Lake in Bristol, New Hampshire. 49 [Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-011]Traveling by train from New York, he arrived in mid-July of 1916, bringing withhim a canoe and small axe “to remind him of George Washington,” 50[Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-010] and a small amount of both ether andmescaline—readily and legally available from the right chemist at the time.Crowley stayed in the small cottage by the lake through the summer and into thefall when much of the resort town shuttered, as is common for the off-seasonperiod. Sitting at the base of what is now the White Mountain National Forest,and fed therefrom, the lake is quite cold even in the summer! To Crowley,however, it was a much needed respite and “magical retirement.” Ironically, uponreaching the shores of the wooded resort town, he recognized that the Adams workwas a distraction from those very personal aims he had dedicated himself to, andhe would all but abandon the project. Despite their eventual split over thefinances, Evangeline Adams ultimately published two books based on Crowley’sinput, Astrology: Your Place in the Sun (1927) and Astrology: Your Place Amongthe Stars (1930). An earlier manuscript of Crowley’s work has since beenpublished under the title The General Principles of Astrology (2002).More importantly, Crowley was working through a deeply personal initiatory phasein his life, begun in New York, which he dubbed “Chokmah Days” after a sphere onthe Qabalistic Tree of Life, meaning “wisdom.” Chokmah is the sphere related tothe attainment of the Grade of the Magus, where the individual becomesinexorably identified with the utterance of his logos, a Greek term meaning“word,” and in this context implying a spiritual truth. (To the Buddha, thatlogos was Anatta, or without-soul, which upended its theological predecessors,for example.) While Crowley had worked hard to accept The Book of the Law andhis position in having received it, to completely give himself over to itsexposition and promulgation was another step altogether. More than simply givinghis ego over to the pursuit of this cause, he now sought to become thepersonification of the logos, of Thelema. We can only speculate whether Crowleyreflected on his religious upbringing in Christ’s utterance and identificationwith “the way and the life,” as well, though he did think to mock-crucify a frogbefore serving it up as frog’s legs for dinner! It was his way of banishing thepreceding aeon’s slavish adherence to the formula of the dying god, nowabrogated. By the time he arrived in San Francisco later that year, Crowley hadattained this goal and began introducing himself with the phrase with which theworld would associate him, “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.”And so he would until the end of his days.Leaving New Hampshire as the autumn leaves fell, he spent time in New York City,New Orleans, and Detroit, to name but a few, as well as making a tour of theWest Coast from Vancouver, British Columbia, to San Francisco, California. Insome places, such as in Detroit, his visits brought the same sort of salaciouspress coverage he had come to expect at home, but in others he remained justanother—albeit somewhat eccentric—British expatriate. By late 1919, the war inEurope now having ended, Crowley was ready to go home.Further ReadingThe General Principles of Astrology by Crowley and AdamsThe AbbeyWhile he had made great spiritual progress during his time in America, Crowley’sreturn to England following the war was less a triumphant homecoming than aresounding defeat on nearly all fronts. His work for The Fatherland may havebeen tolerated and even understood by the British government as the act ofsabotage it was, but the British populace was naturally unaware of theactivities of British Intelligence, much less a saboteur working under noofficial guidance. They saw only his published work and viewed him as a traitor.In retaliation, police had raided the London offices of the O.T.O., and theOrder had been forced to sell off Boleskine for funds, Crowley having investedthe property in the Order prior to his departure as a means of attracting newmembership with its many amenities. He returned penniless and homeless, thematerial manifestations of his magical work in tatters.Undeterred, and given his newfound (albeit compelled) lack of attachments, heconsidered his identification with the Law of Thelema and struck upon the ideathat he should create a community along Thelemic lines where aspirants fromacross the world could gather and pursue their own spiritual enlightenment.Consulting the I Ching, as he often did in times such as this, the oraclepointed to a small town on the Sicilian coast: Cefalu. Yet, these were troublingtimes on the continent, and Crowley found himself arriving in Rome on the veryday of the fascist Mussolini’s coup d’état and consolidation of his power as IlDuce. The fullness of that terrible history having yet to be written, he movedon by train from the events in the capital city to the coast, and across theblue waters of the Mediterranean to the island of Sicily. The town of Cefaluitself lay in the center of the northern coast of that island, known in ancienttimes as Cephaloedium, its rustic villas nestled amongst the jagged rockformations that soar out of the beautiful ocean waters below. Thought to haveonce been a fortress, one considers the location’s resemblance to the openingstanzas of the third chapter of The Book of the Law, “Choose ye an island!Fortify it! Dung it about with enginery of war!” 51[Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-009]Crowley did not arrive alone, however. He had brought with him Swiss-born LeahHirsig, whom he had met in New York while she worked as an elementary schoolmusic teacher. They had met through her sister, both of whom were interested inoccultism. Crowley and Leah’s attraction to each other was immediate andferocious, and Crowley ultimately consecrated her as his new Scarlet Woman—afterseveral others failed to uphold the task. While he had left the United Stateswithout her, his decision to create a communal temple in Cefalu prompted him tosend a telegram asking her to join him in Paris, where he had paused in hisjourney. This she did, pregnant with Crowley’s child, and bringing her young sonfrom a previous marriage. Crowley’s third child, Anna Leah, affectionatelynicknamed “Poupée” after the French word for doll (puppet), was born in Paris inlate January 1920.Crowley then sent Leah and Anna to stay with family in England and arrange someof Crowley’s financial matters, as well as to allow for better care of theirnewborn child. He and their newly acquired nanny, Ninette Shumway, along withher own young son, Howard, moved on to Sicily, where they sought a suitableresidence to bring to fruition the ideal Thelemic community. Soon finding avilla to rent near the seashore with the help of the local hotelier, thetravel-weary crew settled in and began their work. Leah and Anna joined them inmid-April in the small complex, flush with funds from a small inheritanceCrowley had come into. Crowley himself had set up a temple and consecrated thegrounds as the Abbey of Thelema.Each day at the Abbey would begin with the phrase “Do what thou wilt shall bethe whole of the Law!” Meals were prefaced with a saying of Will, a form ofgrace that reaffirmed each participant’s investment in the accomplishment of theGreat Work. Sex and sex magick were naturally par for the course, as wasexperimentation with drugs designed to introduce ecstatic states, but equallymeditation work along more traditional lines. This location, basking in theMediterranean sun, brought adherents and aspirants alike to the villa to studywith Crowley.The winds of fortune, good and bad, blew heavily on the Sicilian coast. Whilethe initial summer went well, having the energy and excitement of the villa’sconversion to a Thelemic temple at their backs, and several of Crowley’sfollowers joining them over the coming months, conditions at the Abbey began todeteriorate as quickly as the initial inheritance money dwindled. The lushaccommodations of the villa ultimately gave way to squalor and sickness giventhe general lack of sanitary conditions in the small fishing village; but worstof all, Crowley’s infant daughter Anna was sick, having arrived from Englandliterally wasting away. The declining conditions at the Abbey could not havehelped her recovery. In early October, Leah and the baby went to the nearesthospital for assistance, only to find that it was too late. Crowley was onceagain devastated by the loss of a young child. A month and a half later, Ninettebore Crowley another child—another girl—Astarte Lulu Panthea.The British tabloids began to publish sensational articles on the purporteddebauchery and acts of black magick occurring at the Abbey, and the death of apromising young man from Oxford named Raoul Loveday from typhoid while visitingthe Abbey only heightened the furor. While this was no direct cause of theinhabitants, it was unwelcome publicity, and it added insult to the injury oftheir already tenuous situation: while many of Crowley’s supporters sent theoccasional donation, it was insufficient means to pay the rent, or even feedthem.Crowley retreated to Paris once again in early 1922, where he had once set offin such high spirits for the foundation of his Abbey of Thelema, now on thebrink of collapse. He was also severely addicted to heroin, which was commonlyused at the Abbey, and sought to wean himself by magical means from the powerfuldrug. Bringing his literary talents to bear, he managed to turn the romanticizedtale of his addiction and salvation into a pitch for a novel and secured amuch-needed advance, resulting in Diary of a Drug Fiend. Featuring aromanticized characterization of himself as the spiritual guide of theantagonist, Crowley lays his tale of drug excess, addiction, and eventualrecovery against the backdrop of Britain’s newly adopted drug laws, which at thetime of writing had just been passed. The realism of the novel is of course dueto his own experiences, and this ultimately brings the setting back to the Abbeyof Thelema as the location of the main characters’ cure.While their misfortunes mounted, it was political interference that ultimatelydid them in. Mussolini, the same man who had seized power when Crowley was inRome and was made prime minister of Italy in 1922, ultimately expelled Crowleyfrom the country in late April 1923, though the remaining members were allowedto stay. They carried on for several years after, but the master of the Abbeywas now elsewhere, greatly diminishing its intent. Leah’s departure from Cefalu,and from The Beast, effectively dissolved the commune in 1927.Cast to the winds after his expulsion from Italy, Crowley was now forced to livea more or less transient life for the next few years, the relative luxury of hisaccommodations varying according to the contents of his purse. Nevertheless, hewas still focused on advancing Thelema through any means at his disposal, andhis dedication never wavered. His fortunes would be blissfully bolstered by anew acquaintance in the guise of Karl Germer, whom he met at a conference in1925 and who ultimately became Crowley’s successor as head of the O.T.O. underthe name Saturnus. 52 [Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-008]Further ReadingMagick (Book 4)I ChingDiary of a Drug FiendLittle Essays Toward TruthLate Masterpieces: Thoth and TearsAs the late 1920s gave way to the 1930s, we find Crowley traveling frequentlyacross much of Western Europe and attempting to keep up with a growing O.T.O.presence that he managed to foster in the United States—California,specifically—some of whose leadership had studied with him at the Abbey ofThelema in Cefalu. In the early 1930s, he became deeply enmeshed in theburgeoning art scene in Berlin, being a painter himself endeared to the Germanexpressionists of that time; little came of it financially given the postwareconomy and Germany’s fabled “reparations,” which would ultimately pave the wayfor a second World War.Returning to England, he managed to release The Equinox of the Gods in 1936,itself a brilliant edition of The Book of the Law, replete with thecircumstances of its reception and a packet of loose-leaf sheets of thehandwritten manuscript reproduced in the back. This handsome edition, coupledwith a rededication, sold reasonably well, all things considered, and emboldenedCrowley to continue his work in other areas despite boasting a name that hadbeen dragged through the mud by the popular press and the loss of a libel suitin 1935 that strained his already dire financial situation.The one positive note out of his legal misfortunes was that he met PatriciaDoherty, who had come to view the trial, sensationalized by the press.Significantly younger than Crowley, Doherty and Crowley became casualacquaintances and thereafter friends. On the heels of yet another failedrelationship, and Crowley now sixty years old, he asked her quite out of theblue if she would be willing to bear his child. 53[Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-007] Perhaps surprisingly, she said yes, and on May 2,1937, she gave birth to a son, Randall Gair Doherty, though Crowley dubbed himAleister Ataturk. It was his first boy, and would be his last child.The 1940s arrived with war on its heels, with Adolf Hitler invading Poland in1939. The second world war began in earnest, including the blitz on Britain.Though he had retained his contacts in British Intelligence from his days in thefirst world war, he was in his midsixties and well past the age of any activemilitary service. However, hearing of the occult inclinations of the ThirdReich, he did lay claim to the proposition of the “V for Victory!” hand signthat Churchill used throughout the war, allegedly passing it on through hiscontacts. 54 [Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-006] For Crowley, “V” stood for thedestructive power of the Egyptian deity Apophis, leveraged as a counter to theuse of the Nazi swastika. If the Nazi high command were as esoterically inclinedas was believed, they could not help but understand his intent—or so hesurmised.Crowley had taken up residence at 93 Jermyn Street in London, and despite theconstant bombardment throughout the blitz, the wartime rationing, and hisever-precarious health issues, Crowley was active as he could manage in hisprojects, not least of which was the ambitious Book of Thoth, a reimagining ofthe tarot in the light of his decades of study in alignment with Thelemicphilosophy. Detailing each card with intense precision, his vision would bepatiently—and sometimes not so patiently—manifested by Lady Frieda Harris, apainter whose style of projective geometry has become the signature style of thedeck.The Thoth Tarot deck is imbued with peculiarities not just in its imagery,however. Reverting a change made by Mathers and the Golden Dawn, Crowleyreturned the Strength card to its original position at number eleven and Justiceto its position at eight. Not content to stop there, he then renamed the Justicecard “Adjustment” to remove the worldly and subjective concept of justice, whichhe did not believe to be a natural law. He equally renamed Strength as “Lust” toengender the idea of “ … the joy of strength exercised.” 55[Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-005] In his view, the card intended to show more thanmere brutish force, and conceptualize the ecstatic experience of exercising awilled intent. Crowley also renamed Temperance as “Art,” noting the subtlebalance of forces in the alchemical art depicted therein. The World was alsoexpanded in scope to “the Universe,” and Judgment to “the Aeon,” whichrepresents a transition from one age to the next rather than the rapturous (ordisastrous!) conclusion associated with the Christian Last Judgment.Most famously, Crowley attempted to solve a problem proposed in The Book of theLaw: “All these old letters of my Book are aright; but [tzaddi] is not theStar.” 56 [Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-004] The eighteenth letter of the Hebrewalphabet, tzaddi, is related to the Star in the tarot by traditionalassociation. Crowley took this statement to imply that the card was misaligned.As a helical pivot on his re-inversion of Strength (Lust) and Justice(Adjustment) cards, he swapped the letters associated with the Emperor and theStar, so that the Star was now attributed to the fifth Hebrew letter, heh, aletter attributed to feminine concepts in traditional Qabalah. This fit theimage of the sky goddess Nuit on the card. The Emperor was thereafter associatedwith tzaddi, where Crowley notes the association with the root term for leaderssuch a Tsar, Caesar, and so on, with which tzaddi is phonetically sympathetic.The cards retained their positions in the deck, however.The result was arguably one of the most fascinating tarot decks ever created, amasterpiece integrating Harris’s finely executed paintings and Crowley’sexpertise in detailing the esoteric intricacies of each with the framework oftheir alchemical roots. A showing of the paintings would also come to pass, withthe originals now restored and kept in the Warburg Institute in London.It was during this time as well that Crowley met a young US Army Captain by thename of Grady Louis McMurtry (1918–1985), who was stationed in Europe during thewar and took leave in late 1943 to visit the aging master magician. McMurtry,previously initiated into the O.T.O. while in his home state of California,helped Crowley with some of his publication efforts, but more importantly heeventually became head of the O.T.O. as Hymenaeus Alpha in the late sixties,resurrecting the Order from the obscurity into which it had fallen after thedeath of Crowley’s immediate successor, Karl Germer, in 1962. McMurtry’s workultimately led to the establishment of the O.T.O. as it exists today.Yet another work came out of Crowley’s latter days that sought to capture theknowledge he acquired over his lifetime. A book of magick with essays spanning abroad range of topics, Aleister Explains Everything was eventually renamedMagick Without Tears, a play on the schoolboy primer Reading Without Tears.After all, he thought, why shouldn’t everyone be taught the proper fundamentalsof magick! The basics of magical ritual—pentagrams, hexagrams, circles, and thelike—are not to be found here, but instead a litany of essays on aspects ofmagick and Thelema less touched upon elsewhere.This book is especially useful to beginners, since it was written through a setof letters between Crowley and an aspirant seeking to learn about magick withlittle or no background. Thus, we find Crowley being exceptionally lucid aboutvery difficult topics and avoiding the use of terms that might confuse thereader, as so often was the case in his other works, often of necessity.Even in his introduction, we find the following advice for the beginning studentin dedicating themselves to the practice of magick: 1. Perform Liber Resh vel Helios. 2. Say Will before meals. 3. Keep a Magical Diary.I equally recommend these practices, which are each further detailed in thelater chapters.Further ReadingThe Book of ThothMagick Without TearsA Greater FeastCrowley’s final years found him at the Netherwood boarding house in Hastings,England, a city southeast of London on the coast. He arrived in January of 1945,and accounts of his time there note that he had lost none of his wit, and eventhen introduced himself with the energetic declaration, “Do what thou wilt shallbe the whole of the Law.” He painted, responded to letters, and visited withfriends, old and new alike. He even had one last opportunity to see his youngson, who at the time was approaching ten.One of the individuals he met in his later years at Hastings would come to haveas nearly a profound effect on magical practice across the globe as he did:Gerald Gardner (1884–1964), one of the founders of modern witchcraft. VisitingCrowley in 1947, Crowley admitted him into the O.T.O. with the magical mottoScire, Latin meaning “To Know.” While Gardner never acted on his charter to helpreestablish the O.T.O. in England, it was clear that Crowley was a profoundinfluence on him, as many of the rites and rituals of modern witchcraft echoaspects of Crowley’s writings and practices. Even the Wiccan Rede is quitefamiliar, in “An it harm none, do what thou will,” among similar variants.57[Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-003]As the summer of 1947 came and went, Crowley’s overall health was deterioratingdue to both heart and respiratory problems, the latter of which he had sufferedthroughout his life. (The dangers of smoking were not widely known at the time,though he did have to quit for a time on doctor’s orders, to alleviate otherconditions.) The oncoming chill of the English winter could not have helpedmatters, and he furthermore became severely dependent on heroin, used to promotesleep when his asthma otherwise prevented it. Wartime rationing of othermedicines forced him to return to the highly addictive drug for a time, and onceagain, unfortunately, he became addicted.Aleister Crowley passed away in the late morning of December 1, 1947, at the ageof seventy-two, having spent his fortune and his life in support of his art.There are many fantastical stories about his supposed last words, most commonlycited as “I am perplexed,” but none of these can be confirmed with any realsense of validity. It is most likely that he passed quietly in his bed, giventhat he had been confined to it for much of the winter months on doctor’sorders.Crowley in his later days at Netherwood, Hastings [image/hastings.png]Crowley in his later days at Netherwood, HastingsHis funeral was held four days later in the cold gray weather one might expectof a December 5th in the south of England. Arranged by his good friend LouisWilkinson, it was a private affair held on public grounds, with readings fromCrowley’s works, including his Hymn to Pan and selections from both The Book ofthe Law and The Gnostic Mass.Of his long friendship with Crowley, Wilkinson recollects, “Some years more willhave to pass before this man can be seen as a whole in true perspective. Such aview is always especially hard to take of anyone of whom admiration andvilification have both been carried to extremes. The difficulty is increased inCrowley’s case because of the variety and the contradictoriness of the elementsin his composition. I do not profess to be able to solve the enigma of hischaracter and his actions. I was glad that he was himself and that I knew him.”58 [Thelema-2.xhtml#footnote-002]LegacyCrowley’s legacy found him fading into relative obscurity apart from a smallgroup of his contemporaries. It was not until the cultural revolution of the1960s that he began to be recognized for the pioneer that he was. Emerging fromthe repressive social climate of the United States and elsewhere in the 1950s,the 1960s introduced mainstream society to many of the same things that Crowleywas advocating throughout his life: the use of drugs in the pursuit of spiritualawakening, sexual freedom, and (yes) magick, to name but a few.To give credit where credit is due, the inclusion of Crowley’s glowering imageon the cover of the Beatles iconic Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band albumis most frequently cited as the spark that rekindled interest in the departedmagus. Included on the suggestion of John Lennon, Crowley appears second fromthe left in the top row of historical figures presented behind the band.Given the popularity of the Beatles at the time, and the groundbreaking albumthat it was, fans naturally wanted to know everything about the people adorningthe cover—and there was Aleister Crowley, the countercultural icon in waiting.Crowley’s depiction as the “evil” magician and early rock-and-roll’s fascinationwith the occult, born of its musical roots in American blues and that genre’sown relationship with tales of the devil, equally advanced the mythos of Crowleyafter his death. Perhaps no greater association can be found than Led Zeppelinguitarist Jimmy Page, who was a fan of Crowley and brought his life and workinto the cultural spotlight as well. Many magical elements were included inPage’s “dream sequence” in their concert film The Song Remains the Same, and thesignature phrase “Do what thou wilt” was inscribed in the wax of some pressingsof their third album. Page purchased Crowley’s Boleskine estate in 1970, thoughit appears he rarely spent time there. He is reported to have collected a numberof Crowley’s works. Other musicians have picked up on this current as well,including David Bowie, who had a keen interest in occultism in general, and theGolden Dawn and Crowley in particular. Ozzy Osbourne released the song Mr.Crowley in 1980, continuing a musical fascination with the “wickedest man in theworld.”The influence of Crowley is no longer relegated to counterculture references,however. A 2002 poll by the BBC of the hundred greatest Britons listed noneother than Crowley among its ranks, at a respectable number seventy-three. Asidefrom his own autohagiography, several scholars in recent years have picked upthe mantle of producing a compelling biography, not least among which arePerdurabo: The Life of Aleister Crowley by Richard Kaczynski, Aleister Crowley:The Biography by Tobias Churton, and Do What Thou Wilt: A Life of AleisterCrowley by Lawrence Sutin.

Prophet? Well … why not?Crowley’s unique life, background, and experience placed him in a position toreceive, accept, and ultimately promulgate Thelema, the pursuit of which becamethe focus of his whole life. He was also a prolific writer with an exceptionalcommand of the English language, and that talent allowed him to communicate theoften-difficult sentiments of such an abstract philosophy in his writings. It isfrom these writings, both published and personal, that we can seek our answersabout the intent of Thelema and how it applies to ourselves.I must also provide a standard disclaimer that any statements made in this workindicate either direct quotations from Crowley or my own present beliefs andexperiences, and I will try my best to ensure I separate the two. The only trueauthority died with Crowley himself—excepting you of course. That’s right. As wewill see, in Thelema, every individual is responsible for determining—andreevaluating—their own set of beliefs through their own experience, and shouldyour beliefs at some point come to disagree with what is presented here, thenthat’s just perfectly fine. In fact, I would encourage it!The Philosophy of Thelema“The word of the law is [image/10.jpg].”—Liber AL vel Legis (The Book of the Law)The spiritual and social philosophy that Crowley spent his life defining andmanifesting is known as Thelema. Thelema means “will” in Greek, spelled Qelhma,and adherents to the philosophy are generally known as Thelemites. Based on hisacceptance and understanding of The Book of the Law, Crowley holds Thelema apartfrom many religious movements in that it is highly individualistic and focuseson every individual doing their will. There is no universal moral that everyadherent must be held accountable to, save for that one injunction, whoseexercise and practice is left to every individual.Do What Thou WiltPerhaps the best-known (and equally misunderstood) tenet of Thelema is held inits principal maxim: Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. It iswithout a doubt the most potent expression of the central idea of Thelema, andwithout context seems to advocate the abandonment of all principled behaviorentirely! However, doing your will is quite different than doing what you want,and considerably more difficult. After all, the hedonistic acquiescence to everyfleeting whim is likely a distraction from what you feel you should be doingwith your life. Though momentarily fulfilling, staying true to your willrequires a great deal more discipline than most people think. What you will todo is truly your life’s calling, discovered over time as the natural course ofan introspective life steers you toward an understanding of who you are.Love Is the LawThe second component to this maxim is “Love is the law, love under will.” Bydivision, we cause hatred and dis-ease: love is that which unites. The phrasealludes to a fundamental concept in Thelema, which is that the ideas of “good”and “bad” are not universal. They are entirely subjective experiences and aregenerally qualified based on the social and religious climate of the time,rather than your own innate understanding. The phrase appears in thefifty-seventh verse of the first chapter of The Book of the Law, and Crowley’sown commentary on that passage redirects the reader to several chapters inanother of his works, Liber Aleph: The Book of Wisdom orFolly. 59[Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-100] Each of these chapters focuses on this specificideal: that even those things by which you are repulsed can be overcome by love.This latter statement deserves some attention. We are likely familiar with whatthis sort of sentiment means in our general society today, and it is decidedlynot what we intend it to mean in Thelema. Nearly everyone sees “love” as the wayof their religion, but the expression of that love is too often falsely borne ofthe ego: they expect the way of love to be a “poor sinner coming to therecognition of their faults.” It is arrogant, in that they presume their moralstance is superior, when in fact it is entirely arbitrary. Thelema posits thateach and every person should develop their own moral code, and through love theycan come to understand the need and virtue of all things that are part of theuniverse. Crowley notes that when Lao Tzu was questioned where the Tao was, hereferred the enquirer to a pile of dung; the Buddha noted that there was nograin of dust that would not reach enlightenment in and through its own way.IndividuationAs a child, born completely free of any external psychological influences orpressures, you are as much “you” as you may ever be. As you grow older, you areexposed to certain expectations about behavior, dress, and similar conformitiesthat need to be followed to conform to and function in the society in which youare entrenched. Failing to observe these customs is likely to bring mockery,scorn, and even overt punishment. These social, religious, and familialpressures, while often well intentioned, essentially warp, bury, or pervert yourconcept of your essential “you-ness.” This was extremely important from anevolutionary perspective when the capacity to select your social group waslimited and the price of expulsion from that group was likely death.However, after tens of thousands of years of biological evolution to reinforcethis idea, we have made exceptional strides in social evolution over perhaps thelast few thousand, accelerating greatly with the technologies of the last fewhundred. We have large cities and massive populations from which we can actuallypick our social groups, generally, as well as our religious influences, if any.Family, as they say, you’re stuck with—but is that even really true? It isdifficult, but it certainly doesn’t bear the risk of death it once did if anindividual decides to sever those relationships. Do note that I am notadvocating this dissociation in any sense, only illustrating the vast scope ofsocial evolution that has occurred over a very short amount of time.Equally, it is easy for us to say, “Well, I’m not part of the herd,” but sciencesays otherwise, and a complete withdrawal from the social fabric is usuallyindicative of a rather severe mental disorder. What we are really saying when weecho this sentiment is that we have found a better herd, one that speaks moredirectly to our own innate understanding of who we are and what we want to be—orat least one that opposes what we don’t. In Thelema, you are urged to defineyour own ideals and moral code, which may indeed lead you away from the confinesof the social circles that you have identified with to that point—but isn’t thatwhat prompted you to begin searching in the first place?Thelema represents a view of the world that truly began to take root in thephilosophers of the nineteenth century as scientific progress (and arguably anequal spiritual regression) swept across the cultural landscape, where now eachindividual is not just able to define who they are, they are somewhat obligatedto do so. In the modern age, at least in more established societies, conformityto a specific social order is less important than it once was, largely becausethere is such a multiplicity. Yet, the religions of the old age still natter onabout their competing versions of conformity according to the will of theirparticular board of directors.With this freedom (and responsibility) must also come the acceptance ofanother’s capacity to do likewise. It does us no good to walk around assertingour right to do something and ignore that effective right in every other person.That’s just being a bully: it’s not likely to end well, and it’s certainly notgoing to bring you any closer to an understanding of your will since that sortof negative behavior is solely about what you want. So, consider that the phrase“Do what thou wilt” might speak not to yourself but to the person you arespeaking to, thereby recognizing their autonomy as well as your own. I thinkthat idea is important to keep in mind, because as Thelemites the idea ofasserting another’s right is as important as asserting our own.Further ReadingLiber Aleph: The Book of Wisdom or FollyLittle Essays Toward TruthThe Religion of ThelemaYou may be asking, “Is Thelema a new religion?” It is a fair question, andCrowley addresses this topic directly in his book Magick Without Tears under achapter bearing exactly that title. In it he notes that Thelema is a religion inas much as it adheres to the standard definition: a set of beliefs, hopefullywith reasonable internal consistency. However, it is important to note that hehas definite reservations about the term “religion,” specifically, saying, “Callit a new religion, then, if it so please [you]; but I confess that I fail to seewhat you have gained by so doing, and I feel bound to add that you might easilycause a great deal of misunderstanding, and work a rather stupid kind ofmischief. The word does not occur in The Book of the Law.” 60[Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-099]Does he contradict himself in saying that Thelema is not a religion? No! Rather,he alludes to the fact that many people have a preconceived notion of whatreligion is, tainted by their own negative or positive experiences, that willinevitably be “brought along” into their understanding of Thelema—a “stupid kindof mischief” that will hamper their capacity to understand Thelema as anythingbut a replacement for the set of moral codes they are seeking to abandon, aswell as dragging along all of the baggage that they have associated with theterm.One can certainly state that it is a religion in the sense of upholding aspiritual philosophy—in harmony with scientific method and observation, ofcourse. Many Thelemites consider it a religion, as evidenced by the Thelemicbasis of the Gnostic Mass of Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica, or Gnostic CatholicChurch, while others simply believe it to be a spiritual philosophy that neednot encumber itself with the idea of religion. So, if you are uncomfortable withcalling it a religion, then call it a philosophy, and vice versa—just be honestwith yourself about why you are inclined to do one or the other.As a new religious movement, it resembles many others in being syncretic—acollection of ideas, iconography, and themes adapted from earlier religiouscontexts, specifically in the representation of the Egyptian gods and theliturgical context of the Gnostic Mass, to name but a few. However, its obviousdifferentiator is that it does not stem from a different (or even radical)interpretation of a preexistent text, but rather from the original dispensationthat is The Book of the Law.Do Thelemites Worship?If we look at Thelema as a religion, it is fair to ask whether that religion hasone or more deities and if they are worshipped by its adherents. From even acursory glance at The Book of the Law, its central text, the Thelemic trinity ofNuit, Hadit, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit stands out as a reasonably strong suggestion thatThelema is in fact a deistic religion. However, under the surface, it is notquite that simple.When we use the term “worship,” it implies a sense of reverence or awe,typically reserved for or conveyed toward a deity. The word occurs eleven timesin The Book of the Law, with variants (worshipped, etc.) occurring five moretimes. Relevant passages include: * In chapter one, we are admonished to “Worship the Khabs … ,” 61 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-098] where Khabs is interpreted as the Inner Light or sole Truth of the individual. * In chapter two, we are—somewhat conversely—urged to not worship Hadit, for it is Hadit who is the worshipper and drawn unto Nuit, the infinite. * In chapter three, we are told to convey the Stele of Revealing as an object of worship, as well as to worship the warlike Ra-Hoor-Khuit with fire, blood, and steel, setting his image in the East and clustering around him like images to support him. 62 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-097]It is in the third and final chapter that we find references to worship as wemight typically define it, and the Stele of Revealing is set in the east at thetop of the super-altar in the Gnostic Mass, the central rite of the O.T.O., aceremony of religious expression along Thelemic lines. However, even consideringthe liturgical rite that is the Gnostic Mass, the congregants there are notworshipping in the sense of directing praise at the principal deities. They arepresent to partake in the Eucharistic rite of the mass, and in so doing expressa sense of awe and reverence toward the source of all life (as represented bythe sun and “the Lord”), which does in a sense meet the criteria of worship asdefined above. Though others may disagree, it is reasonable to suggest that theGnostic Mass does in fact qualify as a ceremony of worship toward the principlesaforementioned, though the term likely suffers from the same sort of “mischief”in bringing along one’s own preconceptions, which Crowley notes with respect toreligion in general. So, as with so many aspects of Thelema, the answer is: it’scomplicated.Aside from the Gnostic Mass, many Thelemites do pay tribute to or otherwise“worship” deities from cultural pantheons outside of Thelema, such as those fromHindu cultures (Ganesha, etc.), Afro-Caribbean practices (Loas, Orishas, etc.),and similar devotional traditions—almost as a form of folk magick. In so doing,they tend to reserve Thelemic deities and practices for greater spiritualmatters, while the extra-Thelemic icons are generally more for common householdmagick. In no sense do Thelemites consider those deities Thelemic in intent ororigin, or even part of the general corpus of beliefs, but Thelema as a religiondoes not generally frown on drawing in practices from non-Western religions,likely because of Crowley’s own religious appropriations andadmixtures—vis-à-vis Frazer’s The Golden Bough. Given that much of Thelema is inprinciple drawn against the major religions of the last few thousand years,however, there is some leeway in interpretation when bringing these deities intopractice: in short, they often bring the god but not the doctrine. It isdifficult to reconcile Judeo-Christian religious practices with Thelema, forobvious reasons, though even these are commonly leveraged within the scope ofmagical practices that originate in those religious contexts. These occur in thepractices associated with Solomonic or Western ceremonial magick in general,which is a common interest among Thelemites due to Crowley’s own focus on themduring various phases of his life, especially during his time in the GoldenDawn.The Stele of RevealingA principal focal point for Thelemic imagery is the Stele of Revealing, which isplaced at the apex of the super-altar in the temple for the Gnostic Mass. Thisis the same funerary stele that Rose indicated in the Boulak Museum ascontaining the “proper” image of Horus as Ra-Hoor-Khuit, the one that Crowleywas distinctly instructed to obtain a copy of during the reception of The Bookof the Law. It is the funerary stele of the priest Ankh-af-na-Khonsu, andcontains Nuit as the dark, feminine figure arching over the top, Hadit as thewinged solar disk thereunder, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit receiving an offering fromAnkh-af-na-Khonsu himself.The Stele of Revealing (front and back) [image/stele_front.jpg]The Stele of Revealing (front and back) [image/stele_back.png]The Stele of Revealing (front and back)Crowley originally had the stele translated from the hieroglyphics into Frenchby the assistant to the curator of the museum. From there, he versified thestele into more poetic form, with due poetic license from the actualtranslation. The first stanza is given as:Above, the gemmed azure isThe naked splendour of Nuit;She bends in ecstasy to kissThe secret ardours of Hadit.The winged globe, the starry blueAre mine, O Ankh-f-n-Khonsu. 63 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-096]It is important to note that the term Stele of Revealing for this funeral steleis only common parlance to Thelemites.SinIt would be remiss of me to avoid discussing the concept of “sin” in Thelema, asinseparable as it is with the concept of religion itself. After all, what’sreligion without the idea of transgression? Bluntly, “a whole lot better.” Ifthe will and morality of an individual is determined for everyone, each forthemselves, then is there no such concept as sin? What would stop someone fromsimply going out and murdering people in line at the local coffee shop simply toget a jump start on their latte? Addressing this is yet another well-known andequally misunderstood phrase in The Book of the Law, “The word of sin isRestriction.” 64 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-095]The Book of the Law notes that “Every man and every woman is a star.” 65[Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-094] Crowley expounds on this idea by stating thatevery individual must have their own path through the cosmos. This path is ourTrue Will, in harmony with the Universal Will of the cosmos, and if we simplylet that course direct us, then we will be all the happier for it. The troublecomes when we are distracted from that course: we feel the strain of gravitationto our true path, and worse yet we start bumping into things that may or may notbe in the groove of their own respective orbits. This is an allegory forinterpersonal conflict, and by its resolution demonstrates the idea that if weare all doing our True Will, then there will not be conflict.This is perhaps overly fanciful, but “No religion has failed hitherto by notpromising enough … ” 66 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-093] These, again, areallegories that point the way: if you are sticking to your own path, then thewanderings of other stars are less of a concern to you—even should they bumpinto you! The strength of your course will overcome and you will move on.When we think of sin in the Judeo-Christian context, it is either inherited fromthe misdeeds of our forefathers or a personal failure to uphold theinterpretations of the observed legal injunctions of the relevant holy book.Each category generally represents a failure in the direction of excess, be itpride, gluttony, covetousness, and so on. In Thelema, we can recognize thatthese outwardly excessive actions are manifestations of inward restriction—alashing out against the confines of a social and religious fabric that hascaused them to deviate from the path of their True Will. The more they wanderoff route, the more difficult it can be to find the way back, and the moreterribly their psyche reacts.Evil (So Called) and Black MagickWith Crowley’s amusing reputation as “the wickedest man in the world,” hisself-identification with “The Beast” of the Christian apocalypse, and his ideason the nature of sin from a religious context, it stands to reason that he mighthave a somewhat different point of view from his contemporaries when it comes tothe philosophical problem of evil—which is to say, his Christian contemporaries.That Thelema might vary from the view held by the prevailing religious doctrinesshould come as no surprise, but how does Thelema treat a core theological issuethat lies at the root of nearly every religious philosophy?The view of Thelema is simple: evil itself is a subjective human construct.Think about this idea for a moment. What are its ramifications? Well, first youhave to acknowledge that varying cultures and religions have very differentviews of evil, and therefore right and wrong, justice, et cetera. This can bereadily observed even within the scope of a single culture and religion, whoseideas and opinions may vary both with locality and time. “[Justice] has none buta purely human and therefore relative sense; so it is not to be considered asone of the facts of Nature.” 67 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-092] Thelema cannotassert a concept of good and evil, as there is no universal moral on which tohang that hat.That having been said, I am sure your mind is now racing across all of the mosthorrific acts ever imagined by god or man. Surely those must qualify as evil,even in Thelema. To this I can say only two things. The first is that naturedoes not care. At an infinite scope, pulling away in perspective from ourcurrent location, to the planet, solar system, galaxy, galactic cluster, andultimately the vast and barren expanse of the known and unknown universe, eventhe worst calamity imaginable on our nigh-imperceptible speck of rock seemsreasonably insignificant. Were the planet to be wiped out entirely, we might atbest scatter our debris somewhat inconveniently at an indifferent Mars.Secondly, a universal consensus of subjective belief does not make somethingobjectively true. If everyone in the room, or on the planet for that matter,believed you could fly, including yourself, your defenestration would still endpoorly—subjectively, of course.Until the Great work has been performed, it is presumptuous for the Magician topretend to understand the universe, and dictate its policy. Only the Master ofthe Temple can say whether any given act is a crime. “Slay that innocent child?”(I hear the ignorant say.) “What a horror!” “Ah!” replies the Knower, withforesight of history, “but that child will become Nero. Hasten to strangle him!”There is a third, above these, who understands that Nero was as necessary asJulius Caesar.68 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-091]That being said, Crowley made some definitive statements about the concept ofblack magick, which falls somewhat under the purview of evil. Oft accused ofbeing a black magician himself, he took pains to define what black magick waswithin the scope of his philosophy. In Magick, he notes, “But ‘to sell one’ssoul to the devil,’ to renounce no matter what for an equivalent in personalgain, is black magick. You are no longer a noble giver of your all, but a meanhuckster.” 69 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-090] He also classifies any force ofmagick for material ends as inherently black magick, including in this lot“Christian Scientists, Mental Healers, Professional Diviners, Psychics, and thelike.” 70 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-089] It’s not necessarily that thesepractices are in and of themselves wrong, but that their practice for money isagainst the idea of giving yourself over to the betterment of the universe. Itis a misappropriation. To this end, his magical Order of the A dots[image/6.png] A dots [image/6.png] still prohibits the taking of money formagical teaching or effects of any kind, under penalty of expulsion.To trade away the powers of the universe with which you have been bestowed formaterial gain is one aspect in his definition of black magick, but there is aneven more consistent thread through his writing: the concept of imbalance. Inwriting on black magick in Magick, Crowley notes that the principal aim of anyaspirant is to raise themselves “in a vertical straight line.” 71[Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-088] He follows this statement with the idea that anydeviation from this line either tends toward or is black magick. I find thatthis concept is demonstrated most ably in The Book of Thoth, with Crowley’smodification and description of the Justice card, traditionally shown as a womanholding scales and a sword. He renamed Justice as Adjustment and presented itwith similar imagery. As justice is not something observed in nature, he choseto define this card as adjustment, with the idea of reestablishing anequilibrium as the definition of a natural and therefore “good” state. Hecomments thereafter that “Equilibrium stands apart from any individualprejudices … ”72 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-087]Imbalance creates stress within the universe—your universe. This is ablydemonstrated in the physical world by standing up and leaning to one side.Compared to standing absolutely vertical, it places an additional burden on themuscles, causing strain. The more imbalance you create, the more stress it takesto keep reasonably upright—until the point where the muscles give or gravitytakes over and you tumble to the floor. This is true in all things: physically,emotionally, intellectually, and spiritually. Thus, it is a principal duty ofeach magician—and we are all magicians—to seek their own equilibrium on allplanes.DeathDeath and how it is perceived is a central concept in most, if not all,religions, with views of the afterlife ranging broadly from perpetual bliss toeternal torment—or perhaps just a calm dissolution into the void. So, how doesThelema view the idea? As you might suspect, it’s quite a bit better thaneternal damnation. Contrary to many religious viewpoints, Thelema views death asa completely natural occurrence that should therefore be free of fear. Death, infact, should be celebrated as an inevitable step in the natural order of thingsand a necessary consequence of your incarnation, despite the fact that those ofus left behind will generally miss the deceased individual and the patterns theyhave made in our daily lives.As Crowley’s own father often preached, “ … and then?” What about the afterlife?Crowley did appear to believe in reincarnation through much of his adult life,or at least the possibility of it, though that fact by no means implies that youmust believe the same in order to be considered a Thelemite. 73[Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-086] There is no equivalent Heaven, and certainly noequivalent Hell, with his reincarnationist philosophies deriving from his earlyexposure to and satisfaction in the tenets of Buddhism. However, his GnosticMass captures the Thelemic concept of death and the afterlife in the tenth andeleventh Collects, where the congregants stand with their eyes open and headserect:Term of all that liveth, whose name is inscrutable, be favourable to us in thinehour. Unto them from whose eyes the veil of life hath fallen may there begranted the accomplishment of their true Wills; whether they will absorption inthe Infinite, or to be united with their chosen and preferred, or to be incontemplation, or to be at peace, or to achieve the labour and heroism ofincarnation on this planet or another, or in any Star, or aught else, unto themmay there be granted the accomplishment of their wills; yea, the accomplishmentof their wills. AUMGN. AUMGN. AUMGN.Thus, in the final observances of the Collects, eleven short orations on theprinciples of the Gnostic Mass, we find a broad spectrum of possible outcomesand perceptions of the afterlife, each affirming the will of the congregant inits own way. So, as far as I am concerned, you are free to believe what youlike, but we have most certainly cast aside the superstitions of the past inaffirming the natural course of events that is death.The Great Work“The Single Supreme Ritual is the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversationof the Holy Guardian Angel. It is the raising of the complete man in a verticalstraight line. Any deviation from this line tends to become black magic. Anyother operation is black magick.”—Magick, Chapter XXIAs previously indicated, and in a marked departure from the strictures of olderreligions, Thelema asserts the capacity to develop and define your own moralcode rather than adhering to a set of universal principles that are ultimatelyarbitrary and overly simplistic. Its ethos hinges on personal freedom,accountability, and no small amount of introspection. The difficulty inattaining this ideal is twofold: firstly to determine through carefulconsideration and experience what that code is, and secondly to hold yourselfaccountable to that code. The process of determining the first, and doing thelatter, is known as the Great Work.This accomplishment, also referred to as the “Knowledge and Conversation of yourHoly Guardian Angel,” contacting your “Divine Genius,” or any number of similarepithets related to spiritual attainment you are likely to hear passed around,is a core principle of Thelema. This idea far predated Crowley, but hespecifically chose to refer to this process or path of attainment as theobtaining of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, because“The theory implied in these words is so patently absurd that only simpletonswould waste much time in analyzing it.” 74 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-085] Inshort, he purposely selected the most intellectually meaningless title in orderto emphasize that the process itself was not one of intellectual pursuit.Therein lies a very meaningful comment to the nature of the Great Work: whileyou may study intensely to find the path, the path itself is not one ofintellectual pursuit but self-discovery.Oft considered the hallmark of the magical adept, all these terms fall absurdlyshort of describing exactly what the Great Work is and means to the individual.In fact, it is more common to define these ideas in the negative: it is “not”something—it is unfathomable, inexplicable, ineffable, and so on. In that vein,let me make a statement about the Great Work: the Great Work is not somethingthat other people do; it is something you do.The Great Work is not only a central theme of Thelema, but the central theme ofyour whole life. It is yours to set out and do. So, what is it? What does thatmean? In short, the Great Work is the process of finding out precisely who youare and what you want to do with your life—then doing it. The above-mentionedprocess of discovering your own moral code is in fact the process of discoveringwho you truly are as a person. Your sense of morality then comes about as anatural by-product of that understanding. You don’t actually start out byattempting to define your own moral compass, but by working to discover who youtruly are—a center of consciousness in the universe of all potential experience.Your own sense of self-direction when unencumbered by external expectations, theundeterred arc of your star through the infinite, is known as your True Will.Fortunately, there is a means of determining your True Will, and that method issomething with which Crowley is inexorably connected: magick.MagickYou may have noticed, here and elsewhere, the archaic spelling of magick, addingthe final “k” to the more common “magic.” Crowley instituted this practice todistinguish the art from stage magic or legerdemain, which are simply parlortricks designed for amusement. While there are other methods of mystical andmagical attainment, including the practice of raja yoga that Crowley integratedinto his own practices, I believe that the true purpose of magick is to discoveryour own potential, power, and place in the world: your True Will. It is all toocommon that practitioners of magick both ancient and modern promise spectacularpowers, often supernatural in scope, to the prospective student of the art, butlet me nip this in the bud immediately: Magick can give you no powers of whichyou were not capable in the first place, nor any powers beyond the scope ofnature itself.To address this in no uncertain terms, Crowley defined magick in his work of thesame name as follows:MAGICKis the Science and Artof causing Changeto occur in conformity with Will. 75 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-084]So far, so good! So, you ask, if I just will something to occur, I can make ithappen? To a degree, yes. The first caveat to this is that you have to trulywill it, not just want or wish it to happen. The latter two words imply a senseof idleness or passivity; will is action. For example, I can want an ice creamall I like, but that desire is not going to manifest until I arrive at thewindow of an ice cream shop with the financial means to purchase it at a timewhen they are selling it. Alternately, you could sit outside that same shop andmeditate strongly on wanting an ice cream until someone asks what the hellyou’re doing and, amused at your behavior, decides to buy you that same icecream on a whim, but it’s less certain and a bit of a con.The second principle is the one far too many people miss, despite givenimmediately after Crowley’s famous definition of magick:Any required Changemay be effected by the applicationof the proper kind and degree of forcein the proper mannerthrough the proper mediumto the proper object. 76 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-083]This statement is less direct, but it essentially implies that you must actthrough the proper channels in order to obtain your result. Let’s return to ourexample. We must apply the proper kind and degree of force (currency) in theproper manner (at a time and place when the shop is open) through the propermedium (the store) to the proper object (a person working at the store). If weattempt to give them money from another country, representing the wrong kind offorce, we may be less capable of obtaining our end. Similarly, if we attempt togive our money to the wrong person, such as someone else in line, we are notacting through the proper medium on the proper object. They can’t help us withour ice cream problem, but they might well be capable of helping us out of ourmoney, which simply compounds our problem!There is a further implication in that statement, however: you have to becapable of providing the proper kind and degree of force. I can do a greatnumber of things, but I can’t control the weather, shoot fire from my eyes (ormore amusing parts of my body), bench press a car, or turn water into wine. Thesame, I am sad to say, goes for you. Nature reigns supreme, and you must stillwork within her laws.Now, let’s further refine our definition and purpose:Magick is the Science of understanding oneselfAnd one’s conditions.It is the Art of applying that understanding in action. 77[Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-082]All of the practices that will be given in the latter section of this book aremagical in their own right, but each has a specific purpose, even if it is notreadily evident: to bring you to a better understanding of yourself and yourability to effect real change in the world around you. In fact, in order toeffect the greatest change, you must first come to an understanding of who youare.Otherwise your conscious thoughts and actions may be in conflict with, andsubverted by, your actual desire: your True Will. “For pure will, unassuaged ofpurpose, delivered from the lust of result, is in every way perfect.” 78[Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-081] This is at the root of all neurosis, and peopleat war with themselves cannot hope to achieve much of value until that conflictis resolved. Worse yet, their greatest gains are likely to be those that mostcounter their True Will, as the conscious mind fights the subconscious withincreasing vigor!On that note, an understanding of yourself is completely undermined by both theillusion of having power that you do not have and the disillusionment of comingto that same conclusion. Avoid each of these pitfalls by returning always to aposition of skepticism. This term does not mean doubt: once begun, you mustnever doubt! The word itself comes from the idea of questioning, despite its usein common language, implying a neutral, unbiased position. Consider firstwhether you truly will something to manifest, then also whether it is somethingin your power to manifest, then how you may manifest it. Then, if each of theseis in place and proper, act without reservation, hindrance, or doubt. Crowleyincluded on the frontispiece of The Equinox, Volume 1, the phrase, “The Methodof Science. The Aim of Religion” in deference to this idea: everything you dothrough magical practice must be rigorously tested in its efficacy so thatchance conditions do not convince you of powers you do not have and positivesuccesses can be enhanced by further experiment.Be honest with yourself.Know Thy Self.The Magick of Abramelin“My adepts stand upright; their head above the heavens, their feet below thehells.”—Liber Tzaddi vel Hamus Hermeticus 79 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-080]A treatise that Crowley considered of the utmost importance, The Sacred Magic ofAbramelin the Mage is a well-known ceremonial text, largely devotional in natureand inexorably connected to the idea of the Great Work. Written in the fifteenthcentury, it tells the tale of a man traveling the world seeking enlightenment,in vain, until he is finally brought to a master by the name of Abramelin, whoinstructs him on how to attain the Knowledge and Conversation of his HolyGuardian Angel through constant prayer and devotion. S. L. MacGregor Mathers,head of the Golden Dawn and mentor to Crowley, provided an English translationfrom a manuscript found in the Parisian Bibliothèque de l’Arsenal, thoughCrowley notes having been directed to the work as early as 1898.80[Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-079] He purchased his Scottish highland home,Boleskine, specifically to undertake the work there.There are a number of conditions regarding both the operation and the operatorthat are noted in the book, including gender (male, of course), age, parentage,and so on—all aspects that the modern practitioner can safely disregard asthoroughly outdated cultural bigotries of the time. However, other aspects arecuriously tolerant, such as noting the individual should undertake the operationunder the beliefs of their present religion: there is no attempt at conversion.Other magical opinions are given so as to provide the reader with a particularpoint of view when it comes to undertaking this monumental task, such as thetime of day, the arrangement of the temple in which to perform the operation,and similar accouterments relevant to a magical operation, each of which can beleft to the judgment of the practitioner performing the work.While the translation that Crowley read describes a six-month operation of threetwo-month periods, modern translations show that there are actually threesix-month periods, making the operation significantly longer in duration. 81[Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-078] However, since many initiates have undertaken theoperation successfully using the former, incorrect translation of Mathers’sFrench manuscript, it is once more the prerogative of the practitioner todetermine the appropriate time span. What is certain is that the operationshould begin on or around the spring equinox and end on or around the fallequinox.The first period begins with daily orations or prayers, but with relativelylittle other incursion into the daily life of the individual. The second andthird periods intensify both the duration of the prayers and withdrawal fromdaily life until such time as the adherent invokes his or her Holy GuardianAngel—often abbreviated simply as HGA. This invocation releases a significantforce in the magician, and they are compelled by the book to call forth a hostof infernal spirits in order to compel them into submission by the might andauthority of their angel. It also permits the magician to unlock the secrets ofa number of magical squares for the purposes of generally beneficial (butultimately mundane) aims. Thus, much like many similar treatises, there is afocus on a highly spiritual attainment that provides a means to a very tangibleend, and the so-called “Abramelin Squares” were venerated (if not feared) bymembers of the Golden Dawn for their potency. Even so, this can be seen as oneof the many “spiritual gifts” that are available to the magician, but in manycases this continual use blocks further advancement: for after the AbramelinOperation, the Holy Guardian Angel becomes the sole spiritual authority over theindividual, who can then seek out their true will and self-identity through therelationship with that intermediary. This, far above and beyond any tangiblebenefits, is the primary purpose of pursuing the arduous path that is theOperation.Further ReadingThe Book of Abramelin (Denn & Guth)The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage (Mathers)Into the AbyssIf I were to tell you that the end-goal of the Great Work was to face thedreadful demon Choronzon, pour every ounce of your blood into the Cup ofBabalon, annihilating your Self and becoming a Babe of the Abyss, it isreasonably safe to presume that this book would close with a sudden andpermanent clap of its pages. Well …The concept of the Abyss is a difficult one, but it is one inherent to Thelema,and despite the rather difficult apocalyptic symbolism used to describe it, itrepresents a very advanced stage of spiritual development—and one that mostnever attain. To understand this phase of initiation, we must look back oncemore at the Holy Guardian Angel, what it represents, and the path forward fromthat revelation.The attainment of the Holy Guardian Angel, from a psychological perspective, isa manifest personification of your subconscious self, and thereby becomes the“spiritual teacher” that you have always truly longed for. (There is an oldsaying that if you are seeking a spiritual teacher, then just begin your journeywithout, and a teacher will present themselves—that teacher is an allusion tothe HGA.) So, you have a guide to commune with your inner Self, but that leavesyou still one degree of separation apart from your True Self. It’s significantlybetter than having no compass whatsoever, and a tremendous experience, but nowwhat?It takes a significant amount of self-work to attain the HGA, balancing andintrospecting the four elements of your psyche: earth, air, water, andfire—body, intellect, emotion, and aspiration, respectively. With the attainmentof the HGA, you have broken through a barrier where you can begin to understandwho you truly are and formulate your own sense of self, bit by bit. Conversely,this means breaking down the prior constructs of who you thought you werepreviously. While the initial phase of initiation is anabolic, or upbuilding,the second phase is catabolic, or a tearing down. You must peel away the layersof the ego—self and the persona that others, including yourself, have createdaround and about you.True to form, Crowley wraps a lot of this process in the same apocalypticimagery as his beastly moniker, but what the Abyss is truly about is thedissolution of the ego, and even the most peaceful of Buddhists can smile inaccordance with that! If the HGA represents a window to the self, then “crossingthe Abyss” ultimately represents walking in the front door and making yourselfat home. The reason that it is so difficult is that you must tear down your egoand become what Crowley calls a Babe of the Abyss, reducing your ego to nothing,just as it was when you were born. The guardian of this Abyss, to whom Crowleyrefers as Choronzon ,82 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-077] is the ego itself,ceaselessly distracting and perverting your identity from its source of truth:“Bodily functions are part of the machine; silent, unless in dis-ease. But mind,never at ease, creaketh ‘I’.” 83 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-076] So, it’s not somuch as making yourself at home: it’s more like tearing down the old house you’dbeen cramped into and building the home you had in mind in the first place.Crowley notes the Oath of the Abyss as, “I swear to interpret every phenomenonas a particular dealing of God with my Soul,” 84 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-075]which of course is a first-class ticket to madness (and self-delusion) unlessyou’re at a particular initiatory stage to understand it in its propercontext—and let’s be clear that this is after years and years of intensespiritual work. In order to be successful in this aim, we must be willing togive what we perceive to be our own self over, completely silencing theego-self. Hence, we find the image of the Cup of Babalon, the Universal Mother,and the idea of giving every ounce of your blood/life/self unto it, theuniversal life. To the preexistent ego, it feels like a sacrifice, but inreality it is a stripping away of all those parts of you that were not trulyyou.Simple, right? The trouble is that the ego that you are trying to destroy is thevery ego observing itself being propelled toward its own demise, and if there isone thing the ego hates, it is the idea of its own end. Thus, it often occursthat on the precipice of its own salvation, the ego balks. Convincing itselfthat it’s either become an illuminated adept and learned the awful truth aboutthe reality of initiation, or that the reality of the path itself is in some way“evil,” it recoils and wraps itself in a darker and deeper cloak of misfortunethan ever before. Simply put, the individual comes face to face with their owntruth, but they have not sufficiently destroyed their former ego-self, so theyremain attached to it. They can now only see their true self as the enemy, andthereby evil. Crowley termed these individuals the Black Brothers, thecounterpoint to the Great White Brotherhood of egoless adepts. The BlackBrothers only see good and evil, and often little grey between, while those thatsuccessfully make the transition through the Abyss understand the subjectivityof good and evil—and that these ideas are in fact illusory.All of this now allows us to understand the process of the Great Work as awhole.The Great Work (Redux)The great psychologist Carl Jung, in discussing alchemy, noted that itsprincipal aim was “the ritual cohabitation of Sol and Luna.” These luminariesrepresented in alchemical language the positive and negative, male and female.In psychological terms, they also represent the conscious and subconscious mind,an idea that brings us to the culmination of our discussion on the Great Work.If we are in fact born as we were intended but are subsequently moldedpsychologically into someone that we are not, then what can be done to reversethat damage and rediscover ourselves? Stating this question a different way, ifwe are born such that our conscious and subconscious minds are in harmony, howdo we restore our conscious mind to that same state of harmony? How do we bringabout the “cohabitation of sol (conscious) and luna (subconscious)?”If we look to the Abramelin Operation and its ultimate goal in the Knowledge andConversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, this can be seen as fostering apersonification of your “inner voice,” which is itself allowing yoursubconscious mind a vehicle of expression. In short, you begin listening to thevoice inside yourself that knows what is right for you and you alone, the voicethat says who you truly are, absent of all external expectations—the one thathas been there all along.In this light, the HGA is your subconscious mind, and therefore the ultimateguide toward your True Will. What stands in the way of this full expression isthe conscious mind, and in service to advancing that expression are the higherpractices of raja yoga (among others) that seek to destroy the conscious mind.Once the conscious mind is destroyed, it can be reconstituted in the light ofthe subconscious, your True Self. This, then is the culmination of the GreatWork, an individual who is uncompromisingly true to who they are and what theywill to do in the world.The Book of the LawThe book announces a New Law for mankind. It replaces the moral and religioussanctions of the past, which have everywhere broken down, by a principle validfor each man and woman in the world, and self-evidently indefeasible.—Magick, Book 4, “The Summons”Those who discuss the contents of this Book are to be shunned by all, as centresof pestilence.—The Book of the Law, “The Comment”No discussion of Thelema as either a spiritual philosophy or religious movementcan be complete, or can truly even begin, without an understanding of theorigins and canon—if one can call it such!—of The Book of the Law. There areseveral holy books in Thelema, originally released in three volumes,representing inspired works that define further the principles of thephilosophy, but above them all stands The Book of the Law. It is the centraltext of Thelema and by its own instruction should be printed both in text and infacsimile—with holograph images of the manuscript included so that the style andplacement of the letters as written might be consulted. “Change not as much asthe style of a letter; for behold! thou, o prophet, shalt not behold all thesemysteries herein.” 85 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-074]Each of The Book of the Law’s three chapters is related to a deity of theEgyptian pantheon: Nuit, Hadit, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit, respectively. “Why Egyptian?”one might ask, and rightly so. Well, Crowley’s foundational symbol-set was inthe traditions embraced by the Golden Dawn, which borrowed heavily from en voguehistorical adaptations of Egyptology, the Egyptian Book of the Dead, and ageneral cultural fascination in the West. In more traditional associations, Nuitwas the sky-goddess, and hence her elevation to all things celestial. To theancients, the night “sky” in all its vastness was sufficient to denote thatwhich was beyond the terrestrial. As we have evolved our understanding of thecosmos, we can now evolve our understanding of this deity as being the infiniteuniverse. Hadit is less known and somewhat more difficult to define, but may beseen as a form of the solar deity. Ra-Hoor-Khuit is a form of Horus, who avengedthe death of his father, Osiris, and is now the preeminent solar deity: henceRa-Hoor, with the god Ra being the primary sun god.The first chapter is given in the voice of the sky-goddess Nuit, the infiniteuniverse, Great Mother, and embodiment of all potential experience. She isinfinity as we most commonly think of it: vast and incomprehensible as the nightsky. She declares that “Every man and every woman is a star.” Since Nuit isinfinite, we can thus infer that every star is therefore the center of thatinfinite sphere. Yes, you are actually the center of your own universe. Crowleynotes, “The old definition of God takes new meaning for us. Each one of us isthe One God.” 86 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-073] The Priestess in the GnosticMass echoes many of the words from this chapter, as a representation of thedivine feminine.The second chapter is dictated in the voice of Hadit, the Great Father andinfinite contraction in reflection of Nuit’s infinite expansion: he is the pointwithin the infinite sphere. Confirming Nuit’s assertion that she is the infinitecircumference, he notes that, “In the sphere I am everywhere the center, as she,the circumference, is nowhere found.” 87 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-072] He isthe ultimate expression of selfhood in the midst of the infinitudes of possibleexperience. The open and loving phrases of the first chapter are now replacedwith a significant trend toward realism: “I am Life, and the giver of Life, yettherefore is the knowledge of me the knowledge of death.” 88[Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-071] I would not go too far afield in suggesting thathe represents the root of consciousness within the infinite scope of possibleexperience (Nuit): not the ego, which is a manifestation of that consciousness,but the actual psychological root that ultimately manifests the ego—Jung’sconcept of self. It is also in the second chapter that we get the Thelemiccalendar of holy days, which will be treated more fully in the followingsection.The third and final chapter is a fiery and emotional treatise in the voice ofRa-Hoor-Khuit, the same deity depicted in the Stele of Revealing, whoseattitudes reflect in no uncertain terms the occasionally harsh realities andself-accountability of the Law of the Thelema. However, the understanding ofthese harsh realities is in service of the greater good of each and everystar-consciousness. If Nuit represents the infinite scope of experience, or“universal consciousness,” and Hadit represents the unique conscious (andunconscious) experience of the individual, then Ra-Hoor Khuit as the magicalchild of Nuit and Hadit represents the ego-experience of the individual—thatwhich goes. “Nuit is your refuge as Hadit your light; and I am the strength,force, vigour, of your arms.” 89 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-070] As a martialgod, he speaks in terms of war and conflict, which is often difficult forreaders to accept. Even Crowley had a great deal of difficulty accepting thefinal chapter of this work. It is doubtless challenging, but that shouldencourage you to seek what is beyond the words themselves. Few things worthfinding are to be found at face value! Crowley notes that it took him five yearsto accept just the reasonably benign first chapter, never mind the last.With such a brief synopsis of the work, you might think that I was trying to getaway with avoiding any sort of commentary on The Book of the Law. You would bejustified in thinking so, but it is actually well-meaning, because I do not wantto craft your opinions of the work or the meaning of its content—at least notany more than I likely have already. One of the principal admonishments in “TheComment” at the end of The Book of the Law, of which it is part, though includedmuch later, is that each and every person should endeavor to discover themeaning of The Book of the Law for themselves. One approach is to consider it an“open letter” to you personally. You may not understand all of it, and in factmay never, but over time you may come to understand something much greater:yourself.Study it constantly.Further ReadingThe Book of the LawThe Holy Books of ThelemaThe Aeon of HorusOne might think that Crowley would have siezed immediately upon such a powerfulrevelation as The Book of the Law, especially given the proofs demanded in theevents leading up to it. However, this was not the case! He notes quitesuccinctly that, “Aiwass, in fact, was dictating to a hostile scribe.” 90[Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-069] It would be five years before he took up themanuscript again, discovering it in the attic of his Highland estate whilesearching for a pair of skis. Crowley’s dedication to the establishment of theAeon of Horus was about to begin in earnest—but what did that mean?To answer that question, you must first understand the preceding aeons asCrowley understood them, which implies understanding the human conception of …well, conception! In fact, one must understand the ideas behind life and deathas understood by the cultures in that time period, but the theory also hinges onthe fact that over time the earth’s regresses in its position relative to thesigns of the Zodiac—one sign every two thousand years or so. Thus, each agerepresents and embodies nature of the sign in which it resides, giving it itscharacter. 91 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-068]The Aeon of Isis represents the time in human social development where life wasseen to emerge solely from the mother, and it is thereby characterized bygoddess and earth worship. Idealized, these communities would have beenprimarily engaged in deriving their subsistence from the earth as agrariancommunities. The maternal had all the power to create, and from her all life wassustained. As far as they understood, the father had no part in the process ofcreation.The Aeon of Osiris represents the paternal age of the last two thousand years,where it was the father that was seen to have and control the powers ofprocreation. It is also characterized by the masculine gods of death rather thanthe female goddesses of life, including the patriarchs of major religions suchas Abraham, Mohammed, Jesus, and so on. It is also characterized by the idea ofthe slain and resurrected gods found in a number of cultures, such as Attis andAdonis, of which the Christian mythos is but one reflection. The mystery of lifewas now emboldened by the mystery of death, with the Egyptian conception of thesun’s eternal rising and setting being the template long before the advent ofthis particular aeon. The father was now the supreme giver and taker of life, ascan be seen in the attitudes prevailing before, and well into the transitionperiod of, the Aeon of Horus.The Aeon of Horus represents a balance between the maternal and paternalaspects, wherein both life and death are seen as natural complements.Consequently, both the masculine and feminine are seen as complements as well,neither being superior to the other. The nature of this aeon is that of bothsexes combined, as is necessary in nature to create a new life (at least for usmammals).If this seems a bit too far-fetched for you at a cosmic scale, that is entirelyunderstandable, but consider that this same reflection can be made into thepsyche of the individual as it emerges within the scope of a traditional familystructure. 92 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-067] First, there is the mother as thesole sustaining force in the infant’s life. Second, there is the paternalinfluence of provision outside of the mother, where the child now requires foodfrom external sources traditionally gathered by the males of the “tribe.” It isalso the point at which the child recognizes his or her own mortality. Lastly,there is the emergence of the individual as a persona apart from either parent,the psychological severance from the parent in adulthood. The Aeon of Horusrejects such authoritarian dispensation from either the maternal or paternalarchetype: you are on your own now, free and independent.The Beast and the Scarlet WomanNow ye shall know that the chosen priest & apostle of infinite space is theprince-priest the Beast; and in his woman called the Scarlet Woman is all powergiven. They shall gather my children into their fold: they shall bring the gloryof the stars into the hearts of men.—The Book of the Law, I:15Crowley famously quipped that his self-styled honorific of “The Beast” was aname his puritanical mother gave him—likely true! He delighted in his reputationfor wickedness, but often with the double entendre that within that wickednesslay something much greater than mere degeneracy. In that seeming hedonism andwhispers of “immoral” behavior lie the means to a real spiritual freedom in thehands of an accomplished adept. This was not always appreciated by hisaudiences, much less the yellow journalism of papers such as John Bull thatwould routinely spin up wild stories of “The Wickedest Man in the World.”But was he?Crowley grew up in the repressive social climate of Victorian—and thereafter,Edwardian—England, an attitude exacerbated by his own family’s adherence to therepressive religious strictures of the Plymouth Brethren. Even the briefest ofintroductions to his formative years shows a young man in the clutches ofsadistic schoolmasters armed with the horrific might and malice of aself-righteous zealot acting with impunity. These conditions, always under themeasure of religious propriety, nearly killed him—quite literally. Such ascenario certainly sets the scene for the Crowley we have come to know: a manwho promulgated ideas of sexual freedom, mysticism, drug experimentation, andindividual liberty in a rejection of contemporary social mores. That he would doso in such an outwardly scandalous fashion at times should equally come as nosurprise.The idea of “The Beast” is a reflection of the triumphant man that has overcomethe petty morality of prevailing social attitudes in order to be true tohimself. At the time, and even now, this was an overturning of the social order,especially when it came to sex. As a bisexual man in his time and age, to them,he was the Antichrist!The idea of the Scarlet Woman, also taken of course from the biblical book ofRevelation, is the feminine complement to the Beast. A title bestowed originallyon his first wife, Rose, and later to some of his closest partners in thepractice of sexual magick, it has the same connotations: a woman that has castaside the social expectations of propriety with pride, joy, and—yes—lust!Boleskine HouseBoleskine is Crowley’s former home and the direction toward which Thelemicrituals are performed unless otherwise specified. In this aspect, it serves asthe “magical east” or a sort of “Thelemic Mecca” in establishing a currenttoward a particular location. Boleskine itself is an estate on the eastern shoreof Loch Ness in Foyers, northern Scotland, approximately ten miles southwest ofInverness. Crowley originally purchased the estate during his time in the GoldenDawn as a suitably secluded location to perform the intense Abramelin workwithout interruption, but found that he equally enjoyed walking about the moorsin all the trappings of a “Scottish laird.” In all, he lived there nearlyfifteen years, and he later designated the property to the Ordo Templi Orientis,the magical order he came to lead, including it in a small brochure withillustrative pictures as an enticement for prospective initiates.Unfortunately, the house at Boleskine burned in December of 2015, and at thetime of this writing there are no plans to restore it.QabalahGiven the importance of the foundations of Qabalah in Crowley’s thought andwritings, it is inescapable to discuss it in conjunction with him. It can wellbe said that Qabalah not only shaped his thought, but shaped how he thought.Thus, to understand Crowley, you must understand Qabalah, and not just a little.This is a daunting task, given the scope, complexity, and sublimity of the art.Qabalah, also spelled Kabbalah or Cabala, originated as a method of Jewishmystical thought, which continues to be practiced in its traditional form eventoday. In the dawn of the European Renaissance, scholars took some of theseideas and incorporated them into the scope of Christian theology, bothsanctioned and illicit, through work by early humanists such as Giovanni Picodella Mirandola and Johann Reuchlin. Pico’s work attempted to resolve thephilosophical basis of Qabalah, and subsequently Judaism, with that ofChristianity, while Reuchlin had the slightly less ambitious goal of simplyadvocating for its merits. Naturally, neither was overly successful in the sternreligious climate of a continent just then emerging from the Dark Ages.GematriaFrom a traditional Jewish standpoint, Qabalah is used to interpret religioustexts, including what became known as part of the Old Testament in Christiantheology—the Torah. Part of this practice included a method of analysis calledgematria. The Hebrew letters being also numbers, you can sum the letters for aword or phrase to gain further insight, where words having a particular valueare said to relate in some fashion. For instance, the Hebrew root for mother(AM) has a sum of 41 and father (AB) has a sum of 3. Combined, as in marriage,they would add to 44, which is the number of the Hebrew word for “blood,”spelled with the Hebrew letters DM. Thus, one obtains an insight into family andthe concept of generation by “blood relatives” through this analysis.Similarly, one of the names of God used in the Torah is Elohim. In Hebrewletters, this word is spelled ALHIM, whose letters are numerically equivalent to1, 30, 5, 10, and 40. If we look at the base numbers of 1, 3, 5, 1, and 4, thenread backward starting at 3, we get 3.1415—an approximation of pi. 93[Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-066] Of course, the connections that can be made arenearly infinite, but these examples begin to show the potency of theseassociations in building a set of interrelated symbols. Crowley also noted thatThe Book of the Law hid an expression of pi as well, to six digits.Crowley was quite adept at gematria, and he elaborated on the process in TheEquinox, Vol. 1, No. 5. He also consolidated much of the Qabalistic associationshe learned from the Golden Dawn and elsewhere into his work 777, which hedescribes as “a qabalistic dictionary of ceremonial magic, oriental mysticism,comparative religion and symbology.” 94 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-065] In theeighth number of The Equinox, Vol. 1, he also included Sepher Sephiroth, anumber dictionary of Qabalistically significant terms, originally compiled byhis friend and mentor Allan Bennett. This includes the basic information on thealphanumeric associations of the Hebrew alphabet.The Tree of LifePerhaps most central to the Qabalah as it relates to the practice of ceremonialmagick is a cosmological model known as the Tree of Life, which describes thecreation and machinations of the universe in ten emanations known as Sephiroth,the singular of which is Sephirah. These are in fact also preceded by “negativeveils of existence,” called Ain (Nothingness), Ain Soph (Boundless Nothing), andAin Soph Aur (Limitless Light). So, even before the universe came to be, therewas a nothingness that filled all things and then became aware of itself—whichthen prompted the immediacy of existence: cogito ergo sum.The Tree of Life [image/tree.png]The Tree of LifeEmerging from the negative veils, the Tree of Life itself contains ten positiveemanations, the Sephiroth.No.SephirahMeaningAstronomy1KetherCrownFirst Swirlings2ChokmahWisdomZodiac3BinahUnderstandingSaturnNo.SephirahMeaningAstronomy4ChesedMercyJupiter5GeburahStrengthMars6TipharethBeautySun7NetzachVictoryVenus8HodSplendorMercury9YesodFoundationMoon10MalkuthKingdomEarth (Elements)These sephiroth define certain essential qualities as they descend from thehighest and most abstract divine singularity in Kether to the base elementalsphere of Malkuth. These ten emanations are grouped into three triplicities,with the tenth and final sephirah representing the physical world being pendantto them. By the teachings of the Golden Dawn, the first three sephiroth arecollectively known as the Supernal Triad, the next three the Ethical Triad, andthe last three the Astral Triad.The Four WorldsEach of these triads, plus the final sephirah of Malkuth, also reflect a veryimportant Qabalistic concept known as the Four Worlds. Similar to the manner inwhich the sephiroth themselves move from the highest divinity to the physicalworld, the concept of the Four Worlds divides the Tree of Life into four levels,or substrata, whereby the magnificence of the divine again manifests itself inthe material world. The first of these “worlds,” or phases of manifestation, isthe World of Archetypes, called Atziluth, represented by the Supernal Triad. Thesecond is the World of Creation, called Briah, or Beriah, which brings theabstract concept from archetypal form into the stage of ideation. It isrepresented by the Ethical Triad. The third stage is the World of Formation, orYetzirah, represented by the Astral Triad, which begins to shape the idea fromBriah into specific form. Finally, the fourth world, the World of Action,Assiah, represents the specific manifested instance of the form determined inYetzirah.Crowley considered the Qabalah a source of constant study and consistentlyrecommended it to anyone wishing to study magick. Given the intractable expanseof this sublime philosophical system, it is impossible to do it any reasonablejustice within such a limited scope. In fact, it would be difficult to do sowithin any limit of scope. It is a discipline whose study is well rewarded,however. I can only offer the same suggestion, should you wish to come to termswith its view of the universe, and ultimately your view of yourself within thatuniverse.Further ReadingThe Mystical Qabalah (Dion Fortune)The Chicken Qabalah (Lon Milo DuQuette)777 and Other Qabalistic Writings of Aleister CrowleySepher YetzirahSepher Ha-BahirThe ZoharMagical Formulæ of the New AeonFor Crowley, magical formulæ were a means of expressing specific ideas in a veryconcise form, and he would use many of them in ritual performances to enhance orotherwise influence the understanding behind them. As they will both lend anidea to the nature of Thelema and grant a better understanding of the ritualspresented hereafter, several of these formulæ are described here. Some of theconcepts are reasonably advanced, so do not be troubled if you are unable tograsp them immediately!The IAO FormulaVirgo, Isis, Mighty Mother. Scorpio, Apophis, Destroyer. Sol, Osiris, Slain andRisen. Isis. Apophis. Osiris. IAO!—The Golden Dawn, Lesser Ritual of the HexagramIAO is actually an old æon formula: in fact, it is the principle formula of theAeon of Osiris, the resurrected, phallic sun-god, into which category the majorreligions of the last few thousand years generally fall. These are the godsthat—again, in a general sense—follow the Osirian myth of having sacrificed thephallus 95 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-064] either willingly, by accident, or byforce. For instance, Osiris was killed and cut into pieces by his brother Set.His sister/wife Isis collected the pieces and restored him … except for the onepiece that she couldn’t find: his phallus. This solar deity thereafter becamethe lord of the underworld. We find equal stories of castration in the myth ofAttis, the denial of the sexual function in Jesus, and many, many others. Infact, this latter concept of sex-denial has come to be associated withcontemporary religious definitions of “moral behavior,” so-called, which ofcourse is at complete odds with natural behavior.The three letters themselves, IAO, as defined by the adepts of Crowley’s time,represent life, death, and resurrection—or the Egyptian gods Isis, Apophis, andOsiris. At its heart, the idea is that through a symbolic “death” via Apophis,we can emerge as something greater than we were previously—the prima materiarepresented in the natural state (Isis) is transmuted into the risen,supranatural Osiris. It is not a restoration of the former state, but arestoration to a greater state facilitated by this symbolic death ordestruction.FIAOFCrowley extended the IAO formula for the purposes of the Aeon of Horus, addingthe Hebrew letter vau (V) equivalent to the Greek stau (F) to the beginning andend—bringing its numeration to 93 in alignment with the similar enumeration oflove (Agape) and will (Thelema). He describes the nature of this new formula asfollows: * F (The Hierophant) is the manifested individual in its potency and possessed of creative force. * I (The Hermit) is the sperma or root that is the unconscious Will. * A (The Fool) is the blank slate, empty vessel, or host: the unmanifested child. * O (The Devil) is the manifestation of the Will of I in the vessel of O, the enlightenment of the individual F. * F (The Hierophant) having learned of his nature, if even a little.If you are left wanting by Crowley’s exposition above, you are not alone, so letus look at this idea a little more closely. Let’s say you wish to create asculpture from marble—no, not wish, you will to create a sculpture from marble.The possessor of the creative force (F) is you, and the Will (I) to create thissculpture has brought you to this large chunk of stone and the tools with whichto work it (A). Working the stone, you finally create your masterpiece (O), andhave likely learned more of your art through its practice, and more than alittle about yourself (F). Thus, the entire process is one of self-illuminationthrough experience.There is a further and subtler secret in this formula in recognizing that the Iand the O represent the male and female sexual organs, respectively, but it alsospeaks directly to the experience of initiation. We undergo an experience thatchanges us, in which case each experience is a “death” through which we emergeboth the same and somewhat different than before, and hopefully somewhat thebetter. “Each such death is itself life, the means by which one realizes oneselfin a series of episodes.” 96 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-063] If one stops toconsider the orgasm, or “little death,” the formula’s deeper meanings can beascertained.ABRAHADABRAAbrahadabra; the reward of Ra-Hoor-Khuit.—The Book of the Law, III:1The formula expressed by the word Abrahadabra is fundamental in Thelema, so muchso that it is considered the Word of the Aeon. It both begins and ends the thirdchapter of The Book of the Law, and is a variant on the older magical phraseabracadabra, which means “I create as I speak,” symbolic of the Great Work,completed. So, what does that mean?The phrase has a number of interesting numeric properties when studied in thelight of gematria, a method of numerical analysis Crowley was keenly attuned toand on which he placed a great deal of importance. To start, abrahadabra haseleven letters, which brings us to the idea of five and six combined, thepentagram and the hexagram, man and god, thus the Great Work in that union.Reinforcing this idea, the letter A is represented five times, with six otherdiverse letters, where A is a representation of the pentagram, also called thepentalpha—alpha of course being the Greek letter A. So, again, we have thecombination of the five and the six, once again inferring the Great Work.The sum of its letters equals 418, which is also the value of the Hebrew lettercheth spelled in full, as “Ch I Th,” Cheth (8), Yod (10), Tau (400). The letteris itself enumerated as 8, thus having implications to the initiatory current ofthe planet Mercury, which is traditionally associated to that number. Cheth isalso the letter attributed to the Chariot card in the tarot, the bearer of theHoly Graal, which in turn is a reference to the idea of redemption: the bringingof a gross and impure thing to a higher state. The number 418 is also theenumeration of Ra-Hoor-Khuit. Such analysis could go on indefinitely.In The Temple of Solomon the King, Crowley’s own account of his magical journey,he gives a detailed explanation of his own feelings regarding the manifoldimplications of this word, but leaves it at this: “ … always the symbol willremain the Expression of the Goal and the Exposition of the Path.” 97[Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-062]LASHTALUsed within the ritual defined in Liber V vel Reguli, given hereafter, Lashtalembodies within itself the concept of “the all, the one, and the none.”LA is the Hebrew word for “nothing,” or “naught,” while the reverse of theseletters, AL, is the name for God, all things, the omnipotent and eternal. Thus,the entire idea is book-ended by nothingness and everything-ness. Yet, as youmay have guessed, there is more than this. If you consider a positive andnegative, combined they make a neutral: a nothing, a naught. Thus, the conceptof LA can also be seen as the union of Nuit and Hadit, Babalon and The Beast,conjoined—each lost in the other.The combination of central letters ShT is pronounced shet, though not in the wayyou’re likely laughing about presently—though the homophone is close enough! Itis in fact another expression of the formula of the aeon, and representative ofRa-Hoor-Khuit himself. The letter shin, Sh, represents fire, and is associatedwith the Sun card in the tarot as well as having the literal meaning of “tooth,”which is ultimately a weapon of destruction necessary to consume our food. 98[Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-061] The letter teth, T, represents force, and isassociated with the Strength card in the tarot, as well as implying a serpent byits shape. 99 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-060] ShT in combination, as force andfire, is then the dynamic expression of the all and the naught: it is action.That’s right—in the new aeon, life is ShT!AUMGNThis word has been uttered by the MASTER THERION himself, as a means ofdeclaring his own personal work as the Beast, the logos of the Aeon.—Magick, Book 3, Chapter VIIThe word AUMGN was devised as an extension or improvement upon AUM, also spelledOM, the Hindu mantra representing the full course of breath and, ultimately,life. Crowley concluded that this was effectively an old aeon formula whosetermination in the letter M implied the attribution of the Hanged Man in thetarot, where “the formation of the individual from the absolute is closed by hisdeath.” 100 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-059] Leveraging the attributions of themajor arcana of the tarot to improve upon the idea, he included the letters G,the High Priestess, associated with the flux of the moon, and N, Death,associated with ideas of regeneration rather than the terminal M of the HangedMan. This resulted in a triune letter MGN that was affixed to the end of theword, as AUMGN, “symbolizing thereby the subtle transformation of the apparentsilence and death which terminates the manifested life … ” 101[Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-058] It is notable that this compound letter MGNequates to 93, the same number as both Agape (love) and Thelema (will).In full, the word AUMGN equates to 100, which is a number of perfection. It isalso the enumeration of the Hebrew letter qoph, which indicates the “back of thehead” or subconscious. Its tarot card is Moon, representing the manifestedillusion through which we arrive at … well, existence! This new representation,pronounced no differently in practice given the “silent GN,” now reflects theebb and flow of manifestation rather than brute termination of life.[contents] [Contents.xhtml#_idTextAnchor000]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------59 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-100-backlink] “Aleph” is the first letter of theHebrew alphabet and in the Western magical tradition related to the Fool card ofthe tarot, who in turn represents both folly outwardly and sublime spiritualenlightenment inwardly.60 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-099-backlink] Crowley, Magick Without Tears, 219.61 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-098-backlink] Crowley, Libel AL vel Legis, I:9.62 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-097-backlink] In this latter passage, Crowley isinstructed that he would obtain a specific image of Ra-Hoor-Khuit that wouldserve as the primary focus.63 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-096-backlink] Crowley, The Equinox of the Gods,1:1464 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-095-backlink] Crowley, The Book of the Law, I:41.65 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-094-backlink] Ibid., I:3.66 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-093-backlink] Crowley, Magick, 7.67 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-092-backlink] Crowley, The Book of Thoth, 86.68 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-091-backlink] Crowley, Magick, 275.69 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-090-backlink] Ibid., 169.70 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-089-backlink] Ibid., 276.71 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-088-backlink] Ibid., 275.72 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-087-backlink] Crowley, The Book of Thoth, 87.73 [Thelema-3.xhtml#footnote-086-backlink] For example, the present author doesnot believe in an afterlife, but asserts the right of every individual to decidefor themselves.

Some are simple everyday observations, whileothers constitute a more elaborate basis of magical practice. How, when, where,and if you adopt any of these practices is of course up to you, but thefollowing should give you a solid starting point to explore both the everydayobservances and magical practices related to Thelema.Each of these practices is presented in an increasing order of complexity,starting off with very simple everyday practices to integrate into your life asyou see fit and to the degree that you feel comfortable. You do not have tostart doing all of these practices at once, but I will suggest that you do themexactly as described herein, at least until you have a firm understanding of theprinciples. Otherwise you risk implicitly converting them into something morefamiliar to you and your current belief system. While it will feel morecomfortable, it probably won’t be Thelema: it will just be an expression of adifferent belief system adapted from Thelemic practice to conform to what youalready believe, and that misses the point entirely.If any of this feels uncomfortable at first—perhaps even frightening!—that isunderstandable. You are engaging in a new spiritual practice that likelychallenges everything that you have ever known prior. To be a Thelemite you willneed to challenge yourself to face these fears and these discomforts, ratherthan run from them as if they are “bad” or simply not for you. In a way, it isimpossible for Thelema to not be for you, because Thelema is all aboutdetermining who you really are.However, if you decide after a while that youfind other methods more appealing, I certainly can’t argue with that. Just giveeach of these practices, each of which builds on the other, a fair chance first.I think you will find them beautiful, empowering, and helpful in the long run.Thelemic GreetingsThe phrases “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law,” and “Love is thelaw, love under will,” are the principal tenets of Thelemic philosophy andculture. Both of these phrases appear in The Book of the Law, and as a means ofkeeping them constantly in mind, Crowley urged their use in everydaycommunications. Even in the last of his days, he would greet people with anenthusiastic “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law!”Today, Thelemites commonly use a shortened version of this greeting as “93,”referring to the equivalent enumeration of the Greek words for love (Agape) andWill (thelema). Thus, in meeting, it is common to say “93” instead of “hello” or“goodbye” rather than the more cumbersome exchange of the full phrase “Do whatthou wilt shall be the whole of the Law,” and so on. This was also somethingCrowley would do, especially in correspondence.In formal written communications, however, it is customary to begin thecorrespondence with the full “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law,”and complete the correspondence with, “Love is the law, love under will.”Thus, a formal letter might look like the following:Mr. Neuberg,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. I would like to thank you foryour kind hospitality last Saturday. It was a very enjoyable time, and I hope tomeet with you again soon.Love is the law, love under will.AleisterHowever, for informal correspondence, it is more common to use “93” as well, butin a slightly different form:Vic,93Thanks for having me over the other night. Let’s do it again!93 93/93AleisterThe expression of “93 93/93” in closing refers to the same line as before, “Loveis the law, love under will.” The division of 93/93 is a clever device forexpressing love (Agape) “under” will (Thelema).So, do you just start yelling “93” at everyone you meet? That much is up to you,but generally speaking, the use of greetings is exchanged between people whoknow each other to be Thelemites, and not in everyday exchanges like at theworkplace, etc. In Magick Without Tears, Crowley notes, “I don’t think it goodmanners to force my idiosyncrasies down people’s throats, and I don’t want toappear more eccentric than I need. It might detract from my personal influence,and so actually harm the Work that I am trying to perform.” 102[Thelema-4.xhtml#footnote-141]Sage advice, indeed.Saying WillSimilar to the custom of saying “93” in greeting or departing, saying “Will”before eating and drinking is also a custom observed by Thelemites when diningtogether. It consists of a call-and-response, where one person leads the call,and the others reply in the following manner:Leader: [knocks] Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law!Other(s): What is thy will?Leader: It is my will to eat and drink!Other(s): To what end?Leader: That I may fortify my body thereby!Other(s): To what end?Leader: That I may accomplish the Great Work!Other(s): Love is the law, love under will!Leader: [knocks] Fall to!This simple exchange is similar to saying “grace” before meals as observed inmany religious traditions. Similar to the use of “93” in greeting, it serves toreinforce the dedication of the participants to the accomplishment of the GreatWork and establishment of Thelema within the course of their own lives. Whendining alone, you can also perform the entire exchange by yourself, answeringyour own questions as a reminder of your personal dedication toward that end. Italso serves to make the meal a Eucharistic rite, in that the consumption of foodis aimed toward the greater purpose of fulfilling the ultimate will of eachparticipant.The Magical DiaryWe know quite a bit about Crowley’s life not only because of his ownautohagiography, but also because of his exceptional habit of keeping a dailydiary. Yes, there are spots where he was less diligent than others, much asanyone might find about keeping a daily diary, but he was quite fastidious as arule. So great was his belief in keeping a diary that he made it a requirementfor even the probationers of his magical order, the A dots [image/6.png] A dots[image/6.png] . Not only was it a good practice, he considered it fundamental tothe progress of the initiate.Aside from keeping a daily record of your life, Crowley notes that you shouldgive an account of your life to date. Where were you born? Under whatcircumstances, and to whom? What was your childhood like, and so on intoadulthood. Once this is in place, then you are ready to begin your daily work.It need not be exhaustive, but it should be accurate, and leave out no detailsthat come to your mind. Crowley even notes that you should detail anything yourecall before your birth! That would include images or memories from past lives,whether or not you believe in such a thing.Crowley states several items that may be included in the diary in a prefix toLiber E, a work on the development of clairvoyant abilities, the practice ofyoga, and the recording of such experiments. 103 [Thelema-4.xhtml#footnote-140]As a suitable example, he cites his own exhaustive diary in “John St. John,”originally published as a special supplement to The Equinox, Vol. 1, No. 1. 104[Thelema-4.xhtml#footnote-139] We can thus use a few lines to instruct us in theproper form, though it is clear in this case that a surplus of time was at hisdisposal, set aside for the purpose of these operations. To wit, he had sethimself on a study of the practices of controlling the mind—rather, thought—andsought to do so under the same conditions that someone of ordinary means mightdo. There were no trips to mountaintops or exotic locations. No, it was Paris inwhich he found himself, which is exotic enough for some …Oct 1. The First DayAt Eight o’clock I rose from sleep and putting on my Robe, began a little tomeditate. For several reasons—the journey and business of the day before, etc.etc., I did not feel fresh. But forcing myself a little I rose and went out tothe Café du Dôme 105 [Thelema-4.xhtml#footnote-138] where I took coffee and abrioche, after buying an exercise book in which to write this record.This was about 8.45; and now (10.10) I have written thus far.10.45 I have driven over to the Hammam 106 [Thelema-4.xhtml#footnote-137]through the beautiful sunshine, meditating on the discipline of the Operation.It seems only necessary to cut off definitely dispersive things, aimless chatterand such; for the Operation itself will guide one, leading to disgust for toomuch food and so on. If there be upon my limbs any chain that requires adefinite effort to break it, perhaps sleep is that chain. But we shallsee—solvitur ambulando. 107 [Thelema-4.xhtml#footnote-136] If any asceticism bedesirable later on, true wariness will soon detect any danger, and devise ameans to meet it and overcome it.12.0 Have finished bath and massage, during which I continued steadily but quitegently, “not by a strain laborious and hurtful but with stability void ofmovement,” 108 [Thelema-4.xhtml#footnote-135] willing the Presence of Adonai.12.5 I ordered a dozen oysters and a beefsteak, and now (12.10) find myselfwishing for an apple swallowed and chewed by deglutition, 109[Thelema-4.xhtml#footnote-134] as the Hatha Yogis do. The distaste for food hasalready begun.12.12 Impressions already failing to connect.I was getting into Asana 110 [Thelema-4.xhtml#footnote-133] and thinking, “Iwill record this fact,” when I saw a jockey being weighed. I thought ofrecording my own weight which I had not taken.Good!12.13 Pranayama [10 seconds to breathe in, 20 seconds to breathe out, 30 secondsto hold the breath.] Fairly good; made me sweat again thoroughly. Stopped notfrom fatigue but from lunch.[Odd memoranda during lunch. Insist on pupils writing down their whole day; theplay as well as the work. “By this means they will become ashamed, and prate nolonger of ‘beasts.’”]I am now well away on the ascetic current, devising all sorts of privations andthoroughly enjoying the idea.12.55 Having finished a most enjoyable lunch, will drink coffee and smoke, andtry to get a little sleep. Thus to break sleep up into two shifts.2.18 A nice sleep. Woke refreshed.3.15 Am arrived home, having performed a little business and driven back.Will sit down to do Asana, etc.3.20 Have started.3.28 7 Pranayama 111 [Thelema-4.xhtml#footnote-132] cycles enough. Doubtless biglunch is a nuisance.I continue meditating simply.3.36 Asana hurts badly, and I can no longer concentrate at all. Must take 5minutes’ rest and then persevere.Of course, the diary goes on, but you can glimpse even from this theexhaustiveness of a true “magical diary” in practice. Crowley shows an inclusionnot only of the spiritual pursuits that he was undertaking, but also the minordetails of daily life—you never know when one might connect to the other!In personal practice, the contents of the diary, aside from your generalactivities, should include the date and time, astrological conditions (ifrelevant), weather, mood, ideas you may be considering, and especially theresults of any magical practices you have engaged in. It is especially importantto note the outcome of your magical work immediately after completing it toensure as true an account as possible. The memory is quite skilled in adaptingthe recollection of events, subtly and not-so-subtly re-storying the entireaffair. The closer to the event, as well as pen and paper, the more accurateyour record will be.The Thelemic CalendarThe vernal equinox on March 20th is the start of the new year in Thelema,aligning the year with the course of the zodiac that begins anew in Aries andthe emergence of spring in the Northern Hemisphere. Each year is “counted” basedon the major arcana of the tarot in major cycles of twenty-two years, with a“zero” date of the Equinox of the Gods, March 20, 1904, the transition from theAeon of Osiris to the Aeon of Horus. This is much like the Gregorian calendar,which has an inception date of the (alleged) birth of Christ for its basis.Each year’s designation is based on a card in the major arcana of the tarot,indicated by the Roman numeral of that card. Thus, every year the “minor”counter advances by one, but every twenty-two years, the “major” counterincreases by one and the minor counter becomes zero again—just like the singledigits place becomes zero when you reach ten. As an example, on March 20, 2015(of the Common Era), the Thelemic year transitioned from V.i toV.ii—representing the Hierophant with the Roman numeral five (major) andsequentially the Magus and the High Priestess with the Roman numerals one andtwo (minor).Since the basis of the year is astrological, it is also common to note the dateand time using the astrological positions of the sun and the moon. For example,the date and time of an event—even so simple as the time of writing of aletter—might be represented as sun glyph [image/15.jpg] 12° aries glyph[image/16.jpg] and moon glyph [image/17.jpg] 23° leo glyph [image/18.jpg], thesun in twelve degrees Aries and the moon in twenty-three degrees Leo, whichgives the astrological conditions under which the event occurred. It isimportant to note that this scheme is not used in everyday life to “tell time.”It would be not only cumbersome—“Can you come over at Q 12° A, R 23° E?”—butlacks the sense of precision required to reasonably schedule anything!Holy DaysAre there Thelemic holidays? In fact, yes—a number of them. Many of these derivefrom The Book of the Law and the circumstances surrounding its reception, butalso in denoting the major events in the life of a Thelemite: birth, puberty,death, and so on. Other holidays have been included over the years as unofficialobservances, but commonly celebrated nonetheless—such as Crowley’s own birth anddeath.The Book of the Law defines the canon of the religious calendar of Thelema inthe second chapter, verses 36–43:There are rituals of the elements and feasts of the times.A feast for the first night of the Prophet and his Bride!A feast for the three days of the writing of the Book of the Law.A feast for Tahuti and the child of the Prophet—secret, O Prophet!A feast for the Supreme Ritual, and a feast for the Equinox of the Gods.A feast for fire and a feast for water; a feast for life and a greater feast fordeath!A feast every day in your hearts in the joy of my rapture!A feast every night unto Nu, and the pleasure of uttermost delight!Feasts of the TimesAs a natural and recurring observation of the sun’s course throughout the year,it is quite common for Thelemites to celebrate the solstices and equinoxes as“feasts of the times.” Crowley notes that “ … the entry of the Sun into thecardinal signs of the elements at the Equinoxes and Solstices are suitable forfestivals.” 112 [Thelema-4.xhtml#footnote-131]The Prophet and His BrideA “feast for the first night of the Prophet and his Bride” refers to the weddingdate of Aleister Crowley and Rose Kelly on August 12. Rose was of course theScarlet Woman through whom Crowley was led to the revelation of The Book of theLaw, and this date is meant to commemorate that union.The Three DaysA “feast for the three days of the writing of the Book of the Law” isself-explanatory and typically celebrated over the course of the three days ofits reception on April 8, 9, and 10. A common custom is to read each chapter onthe day it was received, with a celebration at noon.A Feast for Tahuti“A feast for Tahuti and the child of the Prophet—secret, O Prophet” is … well,secret! There is no associated date with its celebration, and Crowley notes,“This particular feast is of a character suited only to initiates.” 113[Thelema-4.xhtml#footnote-130] As is often the case with Crowley’s comments tothis effect, it is an allusion to the practice of sex magick.The Supreme RitualA “feast for the Supreme Ritual” is celebrated on March 20 in commemoration ofCrowley’s invocation of Horus that led to his reception of The Book of the Law.The Equinox of the GodsThe “feast for the Equinox of the Gods” is celebrated on the vernal equinox incommemoration of the announcement, by way of the Supreme Ritual, that Horus hadtaken the place of Osiris and that a New Aeon had been set in motion. It alsooccurs on March 20, and is generally celebrated in concert with the SupremeRitual.Fire and WaterThe “feast for fire” and “feast for water” are celebrations of the coming-of-agefor boys and girls, respectively—when they reach puberty. It thus represents asimilar observation to the Jewish bar or bat mitzvah.LifeA “feast for life” is for the birth (and birthday) of a Thelemite. It also hasgiven rise to one of two more commonly celebrated noncanonical holidays, thebirth date of Aleister Crowley on October 12, on which his Lesser Feast iscelebrated—as opposed to the Greater Feast for death. Thelemites also speak ofone’s “solar return” when referring to a birthday, since the Earth has circledthe sun one more time since they were born.DeathA “feast for death” is of course the celebration of death. It has given rise tothe second noncanonical holiday, the date of Crowley’s death, December 1, onwhich his Greater Feast is celebrated. It is important to note that death iscelebrated in Thelema as a natural course and result of having lived in thefirst place. Gone are the days of fear and distress at the approach of theinevitable. “It is of the utmost importance to make funerals merry, so as totrain people to take the proper view of death.” 114[Thelema-4.xhtml#footnote-129]CalendarAllowing for celebrations of singular life-events, the full scope of the annualcalendar (to which your own birthday may be added!) is thus:HolidayDateSpring EquinoxMarch 20Supreme RitualMarch 20Equinox of the GodsMarch 20Three DaysApril 8, 9 & 10Summer SolsticeJune 20First NightAugust 12Fall EquinoxSeptember 21Crowley’s Lesser Feast (Birth)October 12Crowley’s Greater Feast (Death)December 1Winter SolsticeDecember 21Yoga“ … if a chance thought can produce much effect, what cannot fixed thought do?”—Liber Libræ vel XXXAided by the influence of his early friend and mentor in magick Allan Bennett,as well as his friend and mentor in mountaineering, Oscar Eckenstein, Crowleybecame an ardent proponent of yoga, and specifically a branch known as rajayoga. Unlike much of the modern practice of yoga, which focuses on a series ofpostures designed to promote greater health and well-being, raja yoga is focusedon mental discipline and the resultant spiritual attainment. However, in orderto begin that mental work, we first need to conquer the distractions of thephysical body. Only then can we begin turning inward to our thoughts andemotions to begin the long process of introspection that leads us to further andgreater attainments.Yama & NiyamaThese two pillars of yoga are purely ethical, being the exercise of rightthought and right action in things that should be avoided (yama) and things thatshould be engaged in (niyama).In traditional practice, yama consists of the following injunctions: notkilling, not stealing, not receiving gifts, not being dishonest, and avoidanceof excess. The intent of their observation is simple: to ensure that the mind isnot disturbed, especially by thoughts of negativity, anxiety, and so forth.Crowley notes particularly that common sense should be the guide throughouttheir observance, and that each person should endeavor to define their own codeand stick to it.Niyama is less adequately defined, and different texts define them differentlyin type and number. The sage Patanjali, as close as we might hope to find in amaster of the practice, notes them as purity, contentment, discipline,introspection, and contemplation. These all seem fairly reasonable aspirations,but they are based on a cultural context that may not be suited to theindividual temperament. As in yama, the idea is to start here and work out whatleast disturbs the mind—developing a truly “clear conscience,” as it were.In short, if both yama and niyama are to serve in quieting the mind, then theirpractice must be steered toward a course that does not cause a “troubled” mind,each principle in service to the character of the individual. There is thus noset of discrete principles that can be applied as definitive, and so it is leftto each individual to determine through experience which things upset theirpsyche, at which point those things should be avoided. This introspectivepractice alone is of no small value to the practitioner, as it begins to pointthe individual toward his or her true sense of self through acknowledgment ofwhat things cause them distress (or excitement) and what things do not.Asana“The first difficulty arises from the body, which keeps on asserting itspresence by causing its victim to itch, scratch, and other ways to bedistracted.” 115 [Thelema-4.xhtml#footnote-128]The very first practice in yoga is that of posture, or asana, for which Crowleyquotes the yogi Patanjali in stating, “ … asana is that which is firm andpleasant.” We are thus able to grasp the idea immediately: any steady posturethat does not cause significant strain. Its goal is to allow the mind to be freeof the myriad distractions that the body produces, be they a simple itch, thetwitch of a muscle, and so on. This is unfortunately more easily said than done.While modern yoga for exercise has a number of asanas that one transitionsthrough in the course of a session, raja yoga is different: you pick oneposition and you stay in it. Thus, an asana for our purposes may be as simple assitting upright in a chair, or cross-legged, or kneeling, or in some other“firm” position that allows the weight of the body to be supported withoutsignificant muscle strain … at least at first. While starting out, thepractitioner may question why everyone makes such a fuss over sitting still, butone finds quite quickly that the simple act of stillness can be quite difficult!Even the slightest of tensions becomes unbearable after a relatively short time,never mind the occasional itch that just won’t seem to go away. Crowley notes,correctly, that one should not be surprised early on to find that quitting theposture may equally produce several minutes of the most acute agony, as well.Despite these difficulties, he also notes that under no circumstance should youtry another posture once you’ve begun this practice. You may choose to tryseveral postures in the beginning, but once you select the asana that works foryou, stick to it! No progress will be gained by changing to a “better” asanajust when things start to get difficult. Eventually, you will find that theposture becomes quite simple again, and your asana allows you to master thenagging impulses of your body as you begin your meditations.PranayamaPrana is the term for the life force, and is connected with the breath;pranayama therefore is the control of the breath. It should be practiced inconjunction with asana, as each greatly supports the practice of the other.There are a myriad number of specialized practices that include the blocking ofone nostril or another in this control of the breath, the scope of which is toobroad to enter into here. At a basic level, inhaling for four “counts,” exhalingfor an equal measure, and then holding the breath for twice that (eight counts),is sufficient. Each count must be equal, as there is a definite tendency toaccelerate the counts as one runs out of breath! It is also vitally important toensure you do not strain your lungs in this practice. Do not breathe in or outtoo much; at the completion of the exhalation, the body should be relaxed andsupported by the weight of your asana.Crowley also connects this practice with mantrayoga, the constant repetition ofphrases that help prevent the mind from wandering. The most famous of these isthe simple “aum,” but more complicated phrases may be used should you find thatthe repetition of “aum” allows your mind to wander down other paths. Evencounting, as noted above in measuring the course of the breath, may be asufficient mantra. “Aum mani padme hum” is another classic mantra, but it canliterally be any phrase that you can repeat such that it sticks in the mind: “Dowhat thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law,” “Love is the law, love underwill,” “Abrahadabra,” and so on.You may find over time that the phrase you select will “speed up” or begin torepeat at a faster and faster pace in your mind, taking on a life of its own.You may even find yourself well off on another complex train of thought entirelywithout even noticing it, yet your mantra has remained unbroken! This is a goodindicator, but further work will need to be done to retain the focus solely onthe mantra itself.PratyaharaNow that the posture and breath are taken care of, we can turn our attentioninward in the first purely mental practice of the art: pratyahara. This practicebegins the observation of thoughts as they arise in the mind, many of which gounnoticed because they are so fleeting. Crowley notes that just as the body wasfound to be endlessly restless once observed, so the mind shall prove to be—andyet more so.The idea behind pratyahara is thus to control the thoughts. As one begins, agreat number of thoughts whirl by, but the aim at first is simply to observethem without (emotional) reaction. A thought passes, and it is gone; thenanother, and another. As each thought passes the chaotic swirl of thought-stuffthat was your mind begins to unwind, and you begin to find fewer and fewerthoughts to deal with. You begin to feel, perhaps finally, at peace. This iswhen you may begin the next practice: dharana.DharanaWhen most people think of meditation, they are actually inferring contemplation.Here, we imply concentration, which is a very different animal indeed. Dharanais the focusing of the mind on one thought, and one thought only, withoutdiversion. We do this with relative frequency when we get “wrapped up” insomething that demands our intellectual attention at its fullest, but it isdecidedly less easy when the subject of our attention becomes less complex. Youmay find it quite easy to become involved in a difficult math equation forseveral minutes, thinking of nothing else—but what happens when you try toimagine a small white circle? It steadies for a moment, then varies in size,elongates, wobbles, changes color, flips about, and any number of othergymnastics seemingly impossible to its geometry!One should begin this practice already seated and established in a sound asana.Crowley adds a pencil, note paper, and stopwatch nearby such that you may markthe number of “breaks” that occur when attempting to think only upon that simpleobject. (The white circle was merely an example. It can be anything.) Tenminutes should be sufficient to start, marking each time the mind strays fromits object. In many cases, you may find yourself several minutes down asecondary train of thought without even realizing it. The aim is to increaseconcentration, with fewer and fewer marks as one progresses.Dhyana“The most important factor in dhyana is … the annihilation of the Ego.” 116[Thelema-4.xhtml#footnote-127]We now reach the state of yoga that is less a practice than a result, but whoseachievement stems from a consistent practice in dharana. Ultimately, the focusof the mind upon the object is such that one no longer distinguishes the betweentwo. If this sounds a bit mystical, you’re right! Even Crowley struggled to cometo terms in describing the experience of dhyana: “It is indescribable even bythe masters of language; and it is therefore not surprising that semi-educatedstutterers wallow in oceans of gush.” 117 [Thelema-4.xhtml#footnote-126] I shallnonetheless try my best!If we consider dharana as the unbroken focus upon the object in question, wherewe have trained the mind to bear an unwavering connection to its observation,then dhyana is when we’ve managed to do this so expertly that we forgetourselves. The subjective experience of the object—that is, your perception ofthe object as something separate from yourself—falls away in a thunderoussilence. On first experience, it comes as such a great shock that you willlikely fall out of your trance immediately! However, practice and experiencewill once again allow you to prolong this state as well, much as you did in themental concentration of dharana.SamadhiDharana is the holding of the mind to some particular object. An unbroken flowof knowledge about that object is dhyana. When that (i.e. dhyana) gives up allforms and reveals only the meaning, it is Samadhi.—Swami Vivekananda 118 [Thelema-4.xhtml#footnote-125]Samadhi is considered to be the pinnacle of achievement in raja yoga. It is in asense an extension and continuation of the attainment found in dhyana, but yetmore than that—and if so much rubbish has been written about dhyana, I hardlystand a chance to describe the “ultimate union of all things,” the existent andthe nonexistent all at once!Crowley notes that in dhyana even the concepts one is focused on in achievingthis state have a form and idea behind them. Samadhi destroys these boundariesjust as dhyana destroyed the difference between subject (the observer) andobject (the observed). “Not only are all forms and ideas destroyed, but alsothose conceptions which are implicit in our ideas of those ideas.” 119[Thelema-4.xhtml#footnote-124] Crowley makes the analogy of a candle in adarkened room, whose light is made irrelevant by the opening of the shutters andits “annihilation” by the overwhelming rays of the sun. This, perhaps, is thenthe idea of samadhi: the union of the One as indistinguishable from the All.Further ReadingMagick (Part One: Mysticism)Raja-Yoga by VivekanandaThe Shiva SamhitaThe Hatha Yoga PradipikaThe Basics of Thelemic RitualMany of the basics of magical ritual in general can be found in Crowley’s LiberO vel Manus et Saggitae sub figura VI. (I know: it’s a long and eccentrictitle.) It is essentially a primer for magical practice gleaned from his time inthe Golden Dawn, including pentagram rituals, hexagram rituals, the assumptionof god forms, and a wealth of advice for the aspiring student. In order to havea firm understanding of the ritual practices of Thelema, we will tackle each ofthese in turn.PentagramsPerhaps nothing is more closely associated with magick in modern practice thanthe image of the pentagram, the five-pointed star. From Greek magic and sacredgeometry to its use in medieval magical ritual and its modern-day associationwith both Wicca and Satanism, the pentagram has an equal place of prominence inThelema. For Crowley, the pentagram represented the microcosm, or individual.Drawing on its associations with spirit as the fifth element binding togetherthe four traditional elements of earth, air, fire, and water, it can also beunderstood as a symbol of any (and every) man or woman.Modern magical practice associates the pentagram with the elements starting withspirit at the uppermost point. The upper right point is associated with water,the lower right with fire, the lower left with earth, and the upper left withair. Using this arrangement, you can invoke (increase or draw toward) or banish(decrease or push away) the energies of a particular element, which means toeither increase or decrease their influence or potential within the scope of aritual. As an example, the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, perhaps thebest known and most used ritual originating from the Golden Dawn, uses thebanishing pentagrams for the element of earth to clear away any mundane orotherwise unwanted energies.The elemental pentagram [image/pentagram.png]The elemental pentagramIn fact, much of what we have come to understand as a “traditional” arrangementof the pentagrams with respect to invoking and banishing comes from the work ofthe Golden Dawn, who included this information in their teachings. In theirsystem, they devised four invoking and four banishing pentagrams, eachdetermined by where the person started drawing the figure and in what direction.For example, starting at the uppermost point and beginning the figure by tracingthe line down and to the left, moving in a counterclockwise direction, you aredrawing the invoking pentagram of the element of earth. The banishing pentagrambegins on the opposite end of that same line, beginning at the lower left pointand moving clockwise toward the uppermost point. They also included fourdifferent pentagrams for spirit: an active and passive invoking and an activeand passive banishing to correlate to the active (fire, air) and passive (earth,water) elements, respectively. 120 [Thelema-4.xhtml#footnote-123]Among many, many other ritual practices, pentagrams are used in the Star Ruby,itself based on the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, and in Liber V velReguli, both of which are detailed hereafter.HexagramsThe Red Triangle is the descending tongue of grace; the Blue Triangle is theascending tongue of prayer.—The Book of Lies, Chapter 69We often see hexagrams in the context of Jewish mysticism and religiouspractice, typically in the form of two interlocking triangles familiarized asthe Star of David. It is also well entrenched in the Western magical tradition.As a compliment to the five-sided star that indicates the microcosm, thesix-sided star represents the macrocosm, or god.While the points of the pentagram are elemental, the points of the hexagram arerelated to the seven planets known by the ancients: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, theSun, Venus, Mercury, and the Moon. The uppermost point is related to Saturn,then Jupiter on the upper right, Mars on the upper left, Venus on the lowerright, Mercury on the lower left, and finally the Moon on the lowermost point.You’ll notice that I left out one “planet”—the Sun! It is placed in the centerof the hexagram.The planetary hexagram [image/hex_symbols.png]The planetary hexagramCrowley is famous for his use of the unicursal hexagram, meaning a hexagramdrawn using only one line—with a “line” being defined as a figure drawn withoutlifting the pen from the paper—rather than the two lines used in traditionalpentagrams, each forming a separate triangle. This is accomplished as shown inthe following figure:The unicursal hexagram [image/unicursal.png]The unicursal hexagramThis figure is often depicted with a flower having five petals in the verycenter where its inner arms intersect, representing the microcosm, (man) withinthe surrounding hexagram of the macrocosm (god). In this form, it isrepresentative of the Great Work complete—the union of god and man.God Forms and SignsWithin the rituals of Thelema, as in many rituals from modern ceremonial magick,the assumption of so-called “god forms” is intended to attune the practitionerto the postures, energies, and attitudes of that deity within a ritual setting.In so doing, they provide a powerful complement to standard ritual practice,which not only enhances the nature of ritual but can also be an effectivepractice in their own right. The following god forms or signs are used in anumber of rituals that will be discussed herein, so we gather them here forreference.The elemental signs (from left to right): air, fire, water[image/finalELEMENTAL1.png]The elemental signs (from left to right): air, fire, waterShu (Air)Named after the Egyptian sky-goddess who holds up the heavens, this posture isgiven by standing perfectly erect, holding the arms above the head, and withbent elbows turning the hands inward and facing up as if to support the sky. Thefeet are held together.Thoum-aesh-neith (Fire)With the feet together, flatten the hands against the forehead and place themtogether such that only the tips of the index fingers and tips of the thumbstouch, making a triangle pointing upward in the empty space between them, thepalms facing outward.Auramoth (Water)This is the same posture as the previous, Thoum-aesh-neith, but with the palmsinward and the hands forming a triangle at the level of the solar plexus. Again,the feet are together.The elemental signs continued (from left to right): earth, silence, enterer[image/finalELEMENTAL2.png]The elemental signs continued (from left to right): earth, silence, entererSet (Earth)The sign of Set is given by advancing the right foot and raising thestraightened right arm so that the hand, palm down, is above the shoulder, theleft arm straightened and angled behind the body at about the same angle.Harpocrates (Silence)This sign, representing Hoor-paar-Kraat, also known as Harpocrates or Horus theinfant, is given by standing straight, feet together, and placing the extendedforefinger of the right hand (the other fingers closed) against the lower lip,as if to say, “Quiet!” The left hand remains at your side.Horus (The Enterer)The Sign of the Enterer is given by thrusting the open hands outward at thelevel of the eyes while simultaneously stepping forward with the left foot. Itis the active and projective form of Horus, as opposed to the passive orwithdrawn form observed in the Sign of Silence.The Signs of L.V.X.The signs of L.V.X., pronounced looks and meaning “light” in Latin, are a seriesof signs usually given in conjunction with one another. They consist of signsrelated to the Egyptian gods Isis, Typhon, and Osiris, and follow the passionplay of Osiris in Egyptian mythology through life, death, and rebirth. Soundfamiliar? This is another expression of the IAO formula!The signs of L.V.X. (from left to right): Isis Mourning (L), Apophis (V)[image/finalLVX.png]The signs of L.V.X. (from left to right): Isis Mourning (L), Apophis (V)The signs of L.V.X. continued (from left to right): Osiris Risen (X), OsirisSlain [image/finalLVX1.png]The signs of L.V.X. continued (from left to right): Osiris Risen (X), OsirisSlainThe Sign of Isis MourningThis sign represents the L of L.V.X. and is therefore the first in succession.It is also known as the swastika, which of course long predates its nownefarious connections in the West. It represents the swirling forces of creationwith which Isis can be identified. Standing upright, turn the body sideways suchthat the left leg is straight (bearing weight) and the right is behind and bentat an angle such that only the toes are touching the floor. Both arms are heldout in line with the shoulders, the right arm bent upward at the elbow at ninetydegrees, the left arm bent downward at the elbow ninety degrees. The head isbowed.The Sign of ApophisRelated to the great and terrible serpentine Nile-god, this is a destructiveenergy and related to the V of L.V.X. Standing upright and with the feettogether, raise both arms above your head at forty-five degree angles,respectively, holding them in the shape of a V. It is also referred to as theSign of Typhon, who is a monstrous Greek deity, and each represents a principalchallenger or enemy of the primary god (Ra, Zeus, etc.).The Sign of Osiris RisenCompleting the cycle, the third sign represents the risen/resurrected Osiris,representing the X of L.V.X. It is given by standing upright and crossing thearms, right over left, the hands held flat against the shoulders or upper body.The Sign of Osiris SlainA fourth and final sign, not related to one of the letters, is that of the slainOsiris. Standing upright, the arms are held out horizontally in line with theshoulders as if to make a cross. The feet are together.The Signs of N.O.X.N.O.X., pronounced knocks and meaning “night” in Latin, stands for the “Night ofPan,” the point at which the ego-self is destroyed. This idea is elaborated inverse form in one of the Holy Books, Liber VII, and briefly in chapter 1 of TheBook of Lies. In full, their sequence suggests the conception and birth of achild.The signs of N.O.X. (from left to right): Puer, Vir, Puella [image/finalNOX.png]The signs of N.O.X.

The right hand, thumb extended, israised such that the shoulder and elbow are both at ninety-degree angles. Theleft hand, thumb also extended, is placed at the genitals to represent thephallus.Vir (Man)The next sign is Vir, the man. Closing the hands, thumbs extended, place thebase of the hands against the temples, such that the extended thumbs suggesthorns. This is the attitude of Pan.Puella (Girl)The following sign is Puella, or the young girl. This is given by placing theright hand over the left breast and left hand over the genitals, as if to coverup in modesty.Mulier (Woman)This sign is followed by Mulier, or the woman, given by spreading the legs justover shoulder-width and extending the arms above the head and outward, each at a45-degree angle from the shoulder with the hands open and inward.Mater Triumphans (Triumphant Mother)The final sign is Mater Triumphans, or the triumphant mother. It is given bycurving the left hand under the solar plexus, as if to cradle a newborn, and theright hand held to the left breast, thumb and index finger touching as if tonurse. The head is bowed, the feet together.Further ReadingMagick (especially Part Three, Magick in Theory and Practice)The Golden Dawn by Israel RegardieLiber Resh vel HeliosFor Crowley, identification with the Sun as a source of life and vitality wasextremely important in reclaiming one’s own individuality and sense of potency.The sun represents the conscious mind, and therefore the seat of consciousnessand self-awareness, which is by necessity the center of any individual’s worldand scope of experience. It is therefore, in a sense, Hadit: the central pointof any individual’s conscious experience of Nuit. As such, he devised Liber Reshvel Helios as a means of attuning the individual with the course and influenceof the sun. Resh is the Hebrew letter corresponding to the Sun card in thetarot, and Helios is the Greek word for the sun itself. This practice isextremely common among Thelemites, who find it extremely empowering, and referto it as simply “doing Resh.”The purpose of performing Resh is stated in the text of the ritual itself: “Thusshalt thou ever be mindful of the Great Work which thou hast undertaken toperform, and thus shalt thou be strengthened to pursue it to the attainment ofthe Stone of the Wise, the Summum Bonum, True Wisdom, and Perfect Happiness.”121 [Thelema-4.xhtml#footnote-122] Crowley also notes that the performance ofthis ritual will attune the individual to the idea of the sun’s apparent“rebirth” at dawn, and that its apparent death is both illusionary andrepresentative of a normal course of events—much like the life of the individualperforming it.Resh consists of four solar adorations at sunrise, midday, sunset, and midnight,and each of these is associated with a particular Egyptian deity that relates tothat phase of the sun in its apparent course across the heavens: Ra, Ahathoor,Tum, and Keph-Ra. These four elemental god forms or postures, given previously,accompany each recitation, so you can add these when you feel comfortable withthe recitation of the lines.On a practical note, this ritual instructs you to perform it both at sunrise andat midnight, which may be taken more liberally to mean “upon waking” and “upongoing to bed.” It is not the purpose of this observation to engage in prolongedsleep deprivation. These should be relatively easy to incorporate into yourdaily life, with minimal inconvenience, and it will hardly attune your mind tothe life-giving, energizing source of our sun if you’ve not managed more than afew hours’ continuous sleep for several weeks!At Sunrise (Ra)Greet the sun at dawn, facing east, giving the sign of Shu (air). Say in a loudvoice:Hail unto Thee who art Ra in Thy rising, even unto Thee who art Ra in Thystrength, who travellest over the Heavens in Thy bark at the Uprising of theSun.Tahuti standeth in His splendour at the prow, and Ra-Hoor abideth at the helm.Hail unto Thee from the Abodes of Night!Give the sign of Silence.At Midday (Ahathoor)Greet the sun at noon, facing south, giving the sign of Thoum-aesh-neith (fire).Say in a loud voice:Hail unto Thee who art Ahathoor in Thy triumphing, even unto Thee who artAhathoor in Thy beauty, who travellest over the Heavens in Thy bark at theMid-course of the Sun.Tahuti standeth in His splendor at the prow, and Ra-Hoor abideth at the helm.Hail unto thee from the Abodes of Morning!Give the sign of Silence.At Sunset (Tum)Greet the sun at sunset, facing west, giving the sign of Auramoth (water). Sayin a loud voice:Hail unto Thee who art Tum in Thy setting, even unto Thee who art Tum in Thyjoy, who travellest over the Heavens in Thy bark at the Down-going of the Sun.Tahuti standeth in His splendour at the prow, and Ra-Hoor abideth at the helm.Hail unto Thee from the Abodes of Day!Give the sign of Silence.At Midnight (Khephra)Greet the sun at midnight, facing north, giving the sign of Set (earth). Say ina loud voice:Hail unto Thee who art Khephra in Thy hiding, even unto Thee who art Khephra inThy silence, who travellest over the Heavens in Thy bark at the Midnight Hour ofthe Sun.Tahuti standeth in His splendour at the prow, and Ra-Hoor abideth at the helm.Hail unto Thee from the Abodes of Evening!Give the sign of Silence.The cycle of adorations begins anew with the next rising of the sunThe Star RubyThe Star Ruby was originally published in The Book of Lies and later refined inMagick in Theory and Practice, part three of the four-part Magick (also known asLiber ABA or Book 4). It represents what Crowley understood as an improvement onthe Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram created by the Golden Dawn. Therite remains elemental in form, substituting new names for each of the quartersbased on the Thelemic pantheon. The speaking parts are in Greek, but there is noreason English cannot be used when learning the ritual.The practice of the Star Ruby includes a preliminary banishment and invocationin the form of the Qabalistic Cross, a modified version from the one thatCrowley would have learned from the Golden Dawn, who originated the practice andinstead used the Hebrew for the phrase “Thou art the Kingdom, Power, and Mercyforever, Amen.” The ritual then proceeds counterclockwise, as this is thetraditional direction for banishing—against the direction of the sun, ratherthan with it when invoking. This ritual can be used as a preliminary to othermagical work to clear the temple space, as a general banishing, or simply as aneveryday practice for the starting magician.The Qabalistic CrossFacing east, in the center, draw deep deep deep thy breath, closing thy mouthwith thy right forefinger prest against thy lower lip [sign of Silence]. Thendashing down the hand with a great sweep back and out, expelling forcibly thybreath, cry:APO PANTOS KAKODAIMONOS! [“Away, every evil spirit!”]With the same forefinger touch thy forehead, and say SOI, thy member [groin],and say O PHALLE, thy right shoulder, and say ISCHUROS, thy left shoulder, andsay EUCHARISTOS; then clasp thine hands, locking the fingers, and cry IAO.[The Greek means “Thy, O Phallus, Mighty, Beneficient, IAO.” O Phalle here isintended to mean the generative function, whether male or female.]Formulation of the PentagramsAdvance to the East. Imagine strongly a pentagram, aright, in thy forehead.Drawing the hands to the eyes, fling it forth, making the sign of Horus [Sign ofthe Enterer], and roar THERION! Retire thine hand in the sign of Hoor-paar-Kraat[Sign of Silence].Go round to the North and repeat; but say NUIT.Go round to the West and repeat; but whisper BABALON.Go round to the South and repeat: but bellow HADIT.Completing the circle widdershins [counterclockwise], retire to the center, andraise thy voice in the Paean, 122 [Thelema-4.xhtml#footnote-121] with thesewords IO PAN, with the signs of N.O.X.[IO PAN is simply “Hail Pan,” as the omnipresent deity.]Extend the arms in the form of a Tau and say low but clear: PRO MOU IUNGES,OPISO MOU TELETARCHAI, EPI DEXIA MOU SUNOCHEIS, EPARISTERA DAIMONES. PHLEGEI GARPERI MOU ‘O ASTER TON PENTE. KAI EN TEI STELEI ‘O ASTER TON ‘EX ESTEKE.[Before me the Iynges, behind me, the Teletarchs, to my right the Synoches, tomy left the Daimones, for about me flames the pentagram, and in the columnstands the hexagram.]Repeat the Qabalistic Cross, as above, and end as thou didst begin.Liber V vel Reguli“Being the Ritual of the Mark of the Beast; an incantation proper to invoke theEnergies of the Aeon of Horus, adapted for the daily use of the Magician … ”—Liber V vel ReguliLiber V vel Reguli is the first ritual we encounter here that is of a verydifferent nature than most magical students and practitioners are accustomed to.To this point, the rituals and customs are reasonably familiar to even thecasual student of ceremonial magick, if not modified to suit the energiesparticular to the Aeon of Horus. For this reason, Reguli often challenges peoplethat are new to Thelema, pushing them out of their comfort zone, while forothers it draws them in with something new and exciting—if not taboo!In the scope of the ritual, one first establishes his or her “Magical East,”which is to say their magical orientation, to Boleskine, Crowley’s former homeon the shores of Loch Ness in northern Scotland. In so doing, the aspirantaligns him—or herself with the magical current of Thelema in a manner similar tothat of praying toward Mecca in the Islamic faith. Next, they activate thevarious chakras (energy centers of the body as defined in the practice of yoga)with names from the Thelemic pantheon, vertically with Nuit, Hadit, andRa-Hoor-Khuit, then horizontally with Aiwaz, Therion, and Babalon. Thisformulates the Sigil of the Great Hierophant, dependent from the circle, whichis Nuit, where the set of vertical and horizontal lines mimics the staff of theHierophant from the tarot. In full, this serves as a more elaborate version ofthe Qabalistic Cross seen in the Star Ruby.Secondly, the magician calls forth the “words of power,” or magical formula thatdefines the method of working within the Aeon of Horus, completing the act witha battery of knocks: 3-5-3, or three knocks and then five, and then three. Thisindicates the pentagram (five) within the hexagram (three and three), or theindwelling of the macrocosm (god) in the microcosm (individual). Compare thiswith the introductory battery of knocks, being 1-3-3-3-1, which is moreindicative of the sephiroth of the Tree of Life. 123[Thelema-4.xhtml#footnote-120] The word Abrahadabra represents a formulaindicating the completion of the Great Work, echoing that same idea.Next, the magician begins to move about to each of the quarters, as is common tomany rituals of this sort, with a similar invocation of divine names followed bythe signs of N.O.X. However, what is different is the description of thepentagrams; not upright, but averse. For people who have been taught thatinverted pentagrams are “evil” and should never be used, this can be quitejarring. However, above and beyond philosophical discussions on what thesubjective idea of “evil” really is, there is a good reason for this inversion.After invoking all of the quarters and giving the appropriate signs therein, themagician returns, spiraling, to the center and dropping downward, followed bythe sign of Mater Triumphans—the triumphant mother—the mother having givenbirth.That’s right: this is a birth ritual.Aside from a passion play on the birth of the aeon, the birth of Horus, and soon, Liber V vel Reguli can be seen as a powerful ritual for invoking theThelemic current into your own life by a spiritual rebirth. As the child isinverted in the womb, the pentagrams you have created are actually upright fromthe perspective of the child being born! 124 [Thelema-4.xhtml#footnote-119]Finally, the magician invokes “the powers” of AL (god), LA (naught), and ShT, acombination of letters that Crowley understood to mean “force and fire,” thesebeing appropriate invocations for the aeon of the hawk-headed and fiery Horus!The ritual closes with an invocation similar to that seen in the Star Ruby, anda repetition of the opening gesture.The First GestureThe Oath of the Enchantment, which is called the Elevenfold Seal.The Animadversion towards the Aeon 125 [Thelema-4.xhtml#footnote-118] 1.

Itconsists of taking common things, transmuting them into things divine, andconsuming them.—Crowley, Magick, Part Three, Chapter XX.Crowley notes that the Gnostic Mass is the “central public and private ritual ofthe O.T.O.,” created in a flurry of inspiration while traveling in Russia in1913, writing it “under the influence of the Liturgy of St. Basil of the RussianChurch.” It was first published in a periodical called The International in1918, and later in 1919 in Crowley’s own publication, The Equinox, Vol. III, No.I. He also included it in an appendix to Magick in Theory and Practice in1929/30. It is worth noting that while I can describe the Gnostic Mass hereinand provide some personal thoughts on its practice and meaning, final authorityrests with the Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica, and I defer any definitive positionto that organization. The Gnostic Mass is a complex and lengthy ritual incomparison to those given previously, performed by a priest, a priestess, adeacon, and two children, and shared by the congregants, who are activeparticipants themselves. Thus, I do not include it here as something I expectyou to do at home, but rather as something you could experience at a local bodyof the O.T.O., should that be your desire. As a whole, the ritual can beinterpreted as a passion play between an individual (the priest) and theuniverse (the priestess), united by love in ecstatic union, wherein the deaconserves as the intermediary between the two, much as the HGA might in one’spersonal experience. The children are present as countercharged, positive/activeand negative/passive forces that attend the elemental weapons on the altars offire (and air) and water (and earth), respectively.The priest’s journey begins, as it does with so many aspirants, in a tomb in thewest. He is spiritually unawakened until the priestess emerges, descends untohim, and calls him forth with a consecration that allows him to realize his truepurpose. He then elevates and enshrines the priestess upon the altar. When theyfinally reunite, it allows for the “miracle of the mass,” 131[Thelema-4.xhtml#footnote-112] wherein the Eucharist becomes the vehicle of thewill of the priest, thereby each and every congregant in turn.The layout of the temple for the Gnostic Mass is worth reviewing, and isreminiscent of the Tree of Life as a symbolic representation of the cosmos. TheTomb, as mentioned, is set in the west of the temple, the place of the dying sunin Egyptian mythology. Opposite this is an elaborate altar set on a dais, orraised platform, preceded by three steps. This altar is where the priestessremains once she is enthroned by the priest in (and through) adoration, having abouquet of roses on each side, as well as two large candles. Above this altar isa super-altar of two tiers: the first holds The Book of the Law flanked by sixcandles on each side, while the second and uppermost holds an image of the Steleof Revealing flanked by four candles on each side. Two large pillars flank thefront edge of the dais, in offset black and white, and the entirety of the daisis concealed within a large veil. The steps remain outside of the veil, however,as the Priest ascends them in approaching the altar. Between the tomb and daisare two smaller altars, one being the fire altar, containing the active elementsof fire and air, and the other being the water altar, referred to as the fontand containing the elements of water and earth. The priestess and the priest usethese elements to consecrate each other in the opening of the Gnostic Mass, withthe aid of the children. The deacon is generally situated at the base of thefire altar unless attending to other duties within the performance of theritual.With the priest always being male and the priestess always being female, theperformance of the Gnostic Mass has led to some discussion in Thelemic cultureabout gender roles and liturgical assignment—enough so that it bears commenthere. Even with more traditional religious institutions opening the doors towomen in the priesthood, it seems oddly archaic that such a reportedlyprogressive philosophy should assert the necessity of gender assignment in theseroles. 132 [Thelema-4.xhtml#footnote-111] (I will note that the roles of priestand priestess are considered coequal, rather than hierarchical in one directionor another, as in many other religions.) The reason for this gender specificityis a simple one, in that Crowley was writing the Gnostic Mass with a specificmagical formula in mind with a masculine principle, and as such was the only onethat he could write as a man himself. It’s not that a similar feminine formuladoes not or could not exist, but Crowley would have been singularly unqualifiedto write it because he lacked the right equipment! Personally, I don’t believethat Crowley could or should have written a complementary mass from a feminineperspective for the simple fact that he would have been operating out ofconjecture. He simply did not have the psyche of a female to comprehend the truenature of the mass from that vantage.Personally, I find the Gnostic Mass to be an exceptionally beautiful ritual toperform or simply experience as a congregant. While the clergy administer therite as described, the congregants are actively involved in the performance,with explicit actions and orations throughout, starting with the recitation ofthe Creed. There will typically be a review of these actions prior to acelebration of the mass that describes the actions specific to the congregation,each at the direction of the deacon, whose job it is—in part—to marshal thecongregants as necessary.Dieu GardeThis is the default position when standing. The feet are “square,” meaning theleft foot facing forward and the right at a ninety-degree angle with the heelagainst the instep of the left. The hands are held flat in front, loosely, withthe thumbs linked.Step and Sign of a Man and a BrotherThis action is performed by the deacon and congregants prior to the recitationof the Creed. The step is given by starting at Dieu Garde, advancing the leftfoot and then drawing the right back to square. This is followed by placing thethumb of the right hand at the level of the throat, fingers extended and palmparallel to the floor, drawing it sharply across the throat from left to right.Return to Dieu Garde.Hailing Sign of a MagicianPlace the right hand sideways over the heart, the thumb extended at a rightangle to the fingers so that it points upward. The left hand is held open(extending the thumb in the same manner) with the upper arm straight out fromthe body and forearm upward at a right angle to the upper arm. This sign isgiven several times in the early stages of the mass, following the deacon.Flame of AdorationAs the priest begins his ascent to the high altar, the deacon, children, andcongregants kneel, the hands held above the head, joined palm to palm.Attitude of ResurrectionAt the conclusion of the mass, all present communicate—that is, partake of theEucharist, a glass of wine and Cake of Light (communion wafer). The host is madeaccording to the recipe given in The Book of the Law, chapter III, 23–25:For perfume, mix meal & honey & thick leavings of red wine 133[Thelema-4.xhtml#footnote-110]: then oil of Abramelin and olive oil, andafterward soften and smooth down with rich, fresh blood.The best blood is of the moon, monthly: then the fresh blood of a child, ordropping from the host of heaven: then of enemies; then of the priest or of theworshippers: last of some beast, no matter what.This burn: of this make cakes & eat unto me …This recipe requires some explanation and reference to common practice. First,“oil of Abramelin” comes from a recipe given in that same work, consisting ofolive oil, cinnamon, and a number of similar ingredients. The raw cinnamon givesa warming sensation when applied to the skin, and it is commonly used in Westernceremonial magick. Given that Ra-Hoor-Khuit, in whose voice the third chapter iswritten, is a god of war, the fact that blood is involved should not come asmuch of a surprise. Blood is particularly associated with the planet Mars, whichrules over concepts of war. The text then goes on to describe the qualities ofthe blood in respect to how it is gathered, and from what or whom. 134[Thelema-4.xhtml#footnote-109] The biological material is then burned to ash,which satisfies us that any blood-borne contaminants are thus eradicated, andthereafter reintroduced for the purpose of the Gnostic Mass in the recipe givenin III:23, the admixture of meal, honey, and leavings.Following the consumption of the Eucharist, each congregant then echoes thepriest’s words, “There is no part of me that is not of the gods.” The arms arethen crossed over the chest in an “attitude of resurrection,” right over left,with the tips of the fingers at the shoulders. This is the same as the Sign ofOsiris (Risen), given previously.Striking the BreastThe priest strikes his breast two times during the course of the mass using theclosed fist of the right hand against the left breast. On the first of thesestrikes, the deacon and congregants repeat this action following the line “Hearye all, saints of the true church of old time, now essentially present, that ofye we claim heirship, with ye we claim communion, and from ye we claimbenediction in the name IAO.”Many local bodies of Ordo Templi Orientis celebrate the Gnostic Mass regularly,and these celebrations are generally open to the public unless otherwise stated.If you are interested in attending one, contact your nearest O.T.O. body formore information, the details for which are provided hereafter in the finalchapter.It is otherwise given here with minimal commentary.Of the Furnishings of the Temple 135 [Thelema-4.xhtml#footnote-108]IN THE EAST, that is, in the direction of Boleskine, which is situated on thesoutheastern shore of Loch Ness in Scotland, two miles east of Foyers, is ashrine, or High Altar. Its dimensions should be seven feet in length, three feetin breadth, and forty-four inches in height. It should be covered with a crimsonaltar-cloth, on which may be embroidered a fleur-de-lis in gold, or a sunblazeor other suitable emblem.On each side of it should be a pillar or obelisk with countercharges in blackand white.Below it should be a dais of three steps in black and white squares.Above it is the super-altar, at whose top is the Stele of Revealing inreproduction, with four candles on each side of it.

Therefore, by seed and root and stem and bud andleaf and flower and fruit do we invoke Thee.Then the priest answered & said unto the Queen of Space, kissing her lovelybrows, the dew of her light bathing his whole body in a sweet-smelling perfumeof sweat; O Nuit, continuous one of Heaven, let it be ever thus; that men speaknot of thee as One but as None; and let them speak not of thee at all, sinceThou art continuous!During this speech, the PRIESTESS must have divested herself completely of herrobe.The PRIESTESS: But to love me is better than all things; if under my night-starsin the desert thou presently burnest mine incense before me, invoking me with apure heart, and the serpent flame therein, thou shalt come a little to lie in mybosom. For one kiss wilt thou be willing to give all; but whoso gives oneparticle of dust shall lose all in that hour. Ye shall gather goods and store ofwomen and spices; ye shall wear rich jewels; ye shall exceed the nations of theearth in splendour and pride; but always in the love of me, and so shall ye cometo my joy. I charge you earnestly to come before me in a single robe, andcovered with a rich head-dress. I love you! I yearn to you!

Thou are That, andThat am I.I am the flame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core of every star.I am Life, and the giver of Life; yet therefore is the knowledge of me theknowledge of Death. I am alone.

This is evidenced notonly by the increase in popular culture references with each passing year, butalso through attention from scholarly and academic research bringing new lightto the cultural phenomenon, past and present, that both Crowley and Thelemarepresent. This new fascination with Crowley’s life and work has introducedthousands of new people to Thelema and encouraged thousands more to reevaluateCrowley after decades of association with the now dated devil-worshipping legendof popular culture.While there are many, many people who consider themselves Thelemites and fallunder the category of solitary practitioners, Crowley’s legacy in the presentday primarily continues through the organizations with which he was involved:the O.T.O. and the A dots [image/2.jpg] A dots [image/2.jpg] .Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.)One of the most visible legacies of Crowley’s magical writings and teachinglives within the first magical order to accept the law of Thelema, the OrdoTempli Orientis—the Order of Eastern Templars, or Order of the Temple of theEast. In form, the O.T.O. is founded on Masonic lines, with degrees thatgradually lead the initiate toward the greater understanding of its mysteries.Following Crowley’s death in 1947, the leadership of the O.T.O. was passed toKarl Germer (Frater Saturnus), a lifelong supporter of Crowley who had grown upin Germany and emigrated to the United States after the second world war. Germerdied fifteen years later in 1962, unfortunately leaving the Order without anamed successor. It was not until 1969 that Grady Louis McMurtry (HymenaeusAlpha) resurrected the Order based on the authority of letters from Crowleyhimself. Under McMurtry’s leadership, the O.T.O grew out of California’s SanFrancisco Bay area and spread to other major cities across the United States.The current head of the Order, Hymenaeus Beta, is largely responsible forbringing the Order into the prominence that it enjoys today, as well as thelarge volume of scholarship he has provided and fostered on Crowley’s life andworks.Unlike traditional Masonic organizations, the O.T.O. admits both men and women,provided they are free and of full age according to the country in which theyreside. The structure of the Order is divided into three distinct strata, basedon The Book of the Law, “For there are therein Three Grades, the Hermit, theLover, and the man of Earth.” 143 [Thelema-5.xhtml#footnote-146] Each initiatebegins in the Man of Earth triad, which consists of the following grades: 144[Thelema-5.xhtml#footnote-145]DegreeDesignationCycle0°MinervalThe Ego is attracted to the Solar System.I°InitiationThe Child experiences Birth.II°ConsecrationThe Man or Woman experiences Life.III°DevotionHe [She] experiences Death.DegreeDesignationCycleIV°Perfection (also given as “exaltation”)He [She] experiences the World beyond Death.P.I.°Perfect InitiateThis entire cycle of Point-Events is withdrawn into Annihilation.Crowley notes that all subsequent degrees of the Order are simply elaborationson the Second Degree (Consecration), as this degree represents the life of theindividual. “The Rituals V°-IX° are then instructions to the Candidate how heshould conduct himself; and they confer upon him, gradually, the MagickalSecrets which make him Master of Life.” 145 [Thelema-5.xhtml#footnote-144]The Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica (EGC), or Gnostic Catholic Church, also operateswithin the scope of the Ordo Templi Orientis, with authority over celebrationsof the Gnostic Mass.As of this writing, the O.T.O. has thousands of members across the globe.Further ReadingThe Equinox, Volume III, No. 10Liber LII—Manifesto of O.T.O.Liber CI—An Open Letter to ThoseWho May Wish to Join the OrderLiber CXCIV—An Intimation with Referenceto the Constitution of the OrderContact Informationhttp://www.oto.orgA [image/22.jpg] A [image/22.jpg]Separate from the social organization of the O.T.O., the A dots [image/2.jpg] Adots [image/2.jpg] (Argentium Astrum,146 [Thelema-5.xhtml#footnote-143] orSilver Star) is specifically a solitary organization dedicated to the spiritualadvancement of the individual. Initiates of the A dots [image/2.jpg] A dots[image/2.jpg] are tested on the grounds of real magical and mystical attainmentbefore being allowed to progress to the next level, and every individual—atleast in principle—knows only his or her mentor and those initiates he or shemight oversee.The structure of the A dots [image/2.jpg] A dots [image/2.jpg] is also dividedinto three initiatory strata, which from the lowest to highest are the Order ofthe Golden Dawn, the Order of the Rosy Cross, and the Order of the Silver Star,as given in Crowley’s own prospectus on the Order, One Star in Sight: A Glimpseof the Structure and System of the Great White Brotherhood A dots [image/2.jpg]A dots [image/2.jpg] .147 [Thelema-5.xhtml#footnote-142] The Order has elevengrades and depends on real and demonstrable spiritual attainment within eachgrade to progress, with each grade being associated with a specific sphere onthe Qabalistic Tree of Life, just as its predecessor the Golden Dawn had done,and from which it borrows its structure. The corresponding numbers indicate thedegree and sephirah (of the Tree of Life), respectively.The Order of the Silver StarIpsissimus 10°=1°Magus 9°=2°Magister Templi 8°=3°The Order of the Rosy CrossBabe of the Abyss—the linkAdeptus Exemptus 7°=4°Adeptus Major 6°=5°Adeptus Minor 5°=6°The Order of the Golden DawnDominus Liminus—the linkPhilosophus 4°=7°Practicus 3°=8°Zelator 2°=9°Neophyte 1°=10°Probationer 0°=0°There is also the grade of “student,” before even “probationer,” whose task isto acquire a general knowledge of spiritual systems of attainment.The A dots [image/2.jpg] A dots [image/2.jpg] in its current manifestations areindependently directed by several separate claimants, with different students ofCrowley’s having taken up the mantle of his esoteric order.
