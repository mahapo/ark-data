I was living in arun-down loft space on the Bowery with the band’s guitarist and singer, not farfrom CBGB, the club that a year or so later became famous as the birthplace ofpunk rock. My bandmates had a kitschy interest in the occult, which manifestedin the pentagrams, voodoo trinkets, skulls, crossbones, swastikas, crucifixes,talismans, and other magical bric-a-brac that jostled for space with photographsof the Velvet Underground, posters for the Ramones, and Rolling Stones albumcovers on the bare brick walls. We had an eerie statue of a nun standing infront of a fireplace, which was itself covered in occult insignia. A cross waspainted on the nun’s forehead and rosary beads hung from her hand. Tibetantantric paintings, one of which depicted a monk being eaten by his fellows, hungon the walls, and an old doll that Chris, the guitarist, had found in the trashand had transformed into a voodoo ornament was perched over the drum kit.Debbie, the singer, was interested in UFOs, and after rehearsals she oftenconsulted the I Ching about the next band move.We shared the space with an eccentric artist, an older hipster who had adangerous passion for the Hell’s Angels and often dressed in biker gear. Likemyself, he was a fan of H. P. Lovecraft and the Weird Tales set, but he was alsointerested in magic, and he often painted his own version of the tarot deck,modeling his images on Crowley’s then-rare Thoth Tarot. He also gave impromptutarot readings, and I was struck by the seriousness with which he treated thecards. I could tell that for him they were more than just an eccentric form ofentertainment, that they presented something more like a philosophy of life. Herelated the tarot to other things like art and music, and to people I had read,such as Jung and Nietzsche. But the person he mentioned most was Crowley. Heheld up Crowley as a model of what a magical life should be like, and at onepoint he introduced me to someone who claimed to be an illegitimate son ofCrowley’s. I can’t remember who this was, or what we talked about, and I neverdiscovered if he really was Crowley’s son or not.The artist read from The Diary of a Drug Fiend, Crowley’s sensational novelabout heroin and cocaine addiction, which was also an advertisement for hisill-fated Abbey of Thelema in Sicily, where initiates learned how to do their“true will.” Like practically everyone else at the time, I was interested indrugs, and the cover of the book, with a sheik of sorts luxuriating in anopium-induced Oriental repose, certainly caught my eye. I had seen the book inthe window of the old St. Marks Bookshop on St. Marks Place, just up from thefamous Gem Spa, and I wondered when I would have enough cash to buy a copy.Chris had an apartment that he sublet to Tommy Ramone, the Ramones’ firstdrummer and, sadly, the only member of the original group still alive. Oneafternoon we headed to his place and while Chris and Tommy talked, I checked outthe bookshelves. Two books I borrowed that day changed my life. One was TheOccult by Colin Wilson; the other was Crowley’s other novel Moonchild. TheOccult made a powerful impression on me. Aside from a taste for 1940s horrorfilms, I had no interest in the occult or magic, and my knowledge of mysticismwas limited to what I had read in Alan Watts and Hermann Hesse. Wilson took theoccult seriously, and connected it to philosophy, science, literature, andpsychology. Wilson’s ideas about consciousness had a lasting effect on me, butat the time what struck me most was his chapter on Crowley, and the sectionsabout the poet W. B. Yeats and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. I didn’tknow it then but Moonchild was a roman à clef, depicting in an often nasty waysome members of the Golden Dawn. Yeats, for example, against whom Crowley held aparticularly spiteful grudge, comes in for an especially vile treatment.After that I was hooked. I picked up The Diary of a Drug Fiend and read it in aday or two. I was especially struck by the quotation from theseventeenth-century philosopher Joseph Glanvil that opens the book: “Man is notsubjected to the angels, nor even unto death utterly, save through the weaknessof his own feeble will.” Crowley spoke a lot about will. “Do what thou wiltshall be the whole of the law.” “Love is the law, love under will.” Even hiswell-known definition of magic as “the Science and Art of causing Change tooccur in conformity with Will” spoke of it. I knew that will was an importantpart of Nietzsche’s philosophy, and at the time his ideas had the most influenceon me. If magic had something to do with the will, I wanted to know more aboutit.I spent a lot of time at Weiser’s Bookshop on Broadway near Astor Place, thenthe main source for occult literature in New York. I remember a stack of TheConfessions of Aleister Crowley, with its black cover emblazoned with apinkish-purple sigil of Babalon and Crowley’s magical order the A...A... (theArgentium Astrum, or Silver Star) greeting me as I walked in.1[index_split_019.html#filepos729216] Today copies go for several hundreddollars, but back then Weiser’s was selling them at $5 apiece. Weiser’s reprintsof Crowley’s magical magazine The Equinox were going at a similar price. Bookson the Golden Dawn, Israel Regardie’s The Tree of Life, works by Dion Fortuneand Eliphas Levi, reprints of S. L. MacGregor Mathers’s translation of theSacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage, Sax Rohmer’s The Romance of Sorcery, A. E.Waite’s Book of Black Magic and Pacts, Egyptian Magic by E. A. Wallis Budge aswell as his edition of the Egyptian Book of the Dead, and newer works likeKenneth Grant’s The Magical Revival and Francis King’s classic Ritual Magic inEngland were all very affordable. For someone who had just discovered theoccult, it was like walking into Ali Baba’s cave or rubbing Aladdin’s lamp.An edition of Crowley’s magnum opus, Magick in Theory and Practice, also foundits way to me. I couldn’t understand much of it and even today it is not an easyread, but certain things fascinated me. The images of the magician in his blackrobe and hood, making the signs of the elements and of Isis and Osiris, held apeculiar attraction. I was also intrigued by the “curriculum of the A...A...”Crowley appended to the book. The course in “General Reading” especially caughtmy attention. I was already familiar with some of the books that were requiredreading for the aspiring magician, but the idea of a reading course in magic—ormagick, as Crowley spelled it—in general excited me, as did the numerous“official publications of the A...A...” Crowley had listed. These were variousrituals and exercises designed to discipline the magical mind. There wereaccounts of previous incarnations; instructions in invocations and meditation;exercises in how to develop the will and the imagination; instructions inachieving higher consciousness, in breath control, in the tarot, and in thestrange philosophical system called Qabalah that I was just beginning to learnabout. Even the spelling of this struck me as mysterious; shouldn’t there havebeen a u after the Q? Crowley had included some rituals in the book, and thesedidn’t seem like the kind of rituals I had come across in books on black magicor spells, with their candles and spooky ambience. They seemed a strange mixtureof precise directions—rather as in a science experiment—and baffling opaqueness.Over the next few months my interest in magic and the occult became the realcenter of my life, even more so than music, and when tensions with Chris andDebbie developed, they wondered if I was casting spells. When I left the loft tolive with my girlfriend, she became interested, too. We soon discovered that wewere sharing dreams. It happened so often that I wrote a song about it. In 1978“(I’m Always Touched by Your) Presence, Dear” became the only song abouttelepathy—or to have the word theosophy in its lyrics—to make the Top Ten Ithink. But by that time, I had left the band and had moved to California.Gilbert’s Bookshop on Hollywood Boulevard specialized in occult literature andits clientele included David Bowie, the filmmaker Kenneth Anger, and LedZeppelin’s guitarist, Jimmy Page (who once wired his girlfriend $1,700 topurchase a rare Crowley manuscript from the shop). On a visit I saw a notice fora Crowley group pinned to the bulletin board. Not expecting much, I answered it.A few days later there was a knock at my door. I opened it and a ratherunprepossessing character in his early twenties mentioned the postcard I hadsent to the Crowley group and almost immediately asked if I was prepared to takethe probationer’s oath of the A...A... and to be initiated into the O.T.O. (OrdoTempli Orientis), a magical society Crowley became involved with in 1912. To beasked to join two magical societies immediately after meeting someone was, youmight expect, a bit much, as if a Jehovah’s Witness had asked me to join hisflock. But after some conversation I asked myself, am I ready to commit toobtaining the “knowledge and conversation of my Holy Guardian Angel,” the aim ofCrowley’s system and the essence of what he called “the Great Work”? I had beenreading about magic in general and Crowley’s in particular for a good threeyears. Was I serious about it or not? I decided I was and said yes. He handed mea certificate, and told me to read it and then to sign.I soon devoted myself to magick very seriously. I got a robe, performed rituals,worked at my astral vision, practiced tarot and the I Ching, and at the time hadan interest in geomancy, a method of divination using random dots on a sheet ofpaper. Originally this was done with marks on the ground and it was apparently afavorite of Crowley’s. I practiced the technique of self-discipline in Crowley’sLiber Jorgorum, which forbids the use of the word I; infringements are punishedby slicing your forearm with a razor, but I was allowed a milder version andonly had to pinch myself. My initiation into the O.T.O. took place in a house inan LA suburb. I was robed and after a series of questions, the ceremony began.My memory is vague, but I believe Hymenaeus Alpha, then head of the O.T.O.,officiated. Hymenaeus Alpha was the magical name of Grady McMurtry, an ex–Armyofficer who knew Crowley in his last days and who in the early ’70s revived theO.T.O., which had been dormant for some years. In later years it came as asurprise to realize that I had had contact, however brief, with someone who hadactually known Crowley as well as some of the other people I had read about,such as the rocket scientist Jack Whiteside Parsons, who for a time was the headof the O.T.O. lodge whose donations kept the elderly Beast alive.For a time I took to my practices with zeal. Each dawn I performed my sunadorations. I did these at sunset and midnight, too, with little difficulty, butthe noon adorations could cause problems. My girlfriend never quite got used tomy standing up in a Hollywood café, turning to the south, and saying “Hail untothee Ahathoor in thy triumphing, even unto thee who art Ahathoor in thybeauty. . . .” She was even less enthused about hearing “Hail Isis, mightymother” nightly while I performed the Greater Ritual of the Hexagram. And thesmell of the Abramelin oil I wore—a blend of civet and sandalwood that burned myforehead on contact—didn’t turn her on. But the real problem was the fellow whohad knocked on my door. He turned out to be something of a little Crowleyhimself. At least he emulated many of the worst traits of the Beast.2[index_split_019.html#filepos729992]The other members of our group were alright enough, but in truth we were littlemore than an Aleister Crowley fan club. We kept our magical records, a diary ofmagical activities that Crowley insisted upon, and got together regularly todiscuss different aspects of the Great Work. Some of the others talked aboutCrowley’s homosexual rituals or his ideas about “magical masturbation,” the XIoand VIIIo degrees of the O.T.O., respectively, but I wasn’t sure how much theyactually practiced them. My own attempts at practicing sex magick—the IXo degreework—weren’t very successful. But even at that early stage I had a feeling thatsomething wasn’t quite right. And by the time I participated in Crowley’sGnostic Mass, which included ingesting a communion wafer spiked with menstrualblood, I knew that, whatever it might be, my “true will” wasn’t about this.I had by then read everything of Crowley’s that was available. That was quite alot, and some years later, when I sold my collection, I received a substantialsum. I had even dutifully made my way through his Collected Works. Except forthe “Hymn to Pan,” I found Crowley’s poetry pretty tough going. It was allrather forced and his language was painfully old-fashioned. But what troubled memost was the claustrophobic air that had settled around my magical work. Itseemed that no matter where I turned, there was Crowley. Magick, it seemed, hadas much to do with him as with the hidden powers of the mind that I wasdetermined to awaken in myself. Crowley, I realized, had been interested inlittle else but himself. He had climbed mountains and traveled around the world,was a chess master and had penetrated mysterious areas of consciousness, was asexual athlete and had the great spiritual traditions at his fingertips. Butultimately, everything led back to him. Crowley exemplified on a grand scalewhat the psychologist Ernest Becker in The Denial of Death called our adolescentneed to be seen as “an object of primary value in the universe,” and what thepsychologist Abraham Maslow called our hunger for self-esteem. I began to wonderwhat I had gotten myself into. If my magical mentor was any indication,following one’s “true will” meant doing whatever you liked and not worryingabout the consequences. What struck me at first as Crowley’s admirableself-belief and outrageous chutzpah now seemed an obsessive self-regard and anadolescent insensitivity to the feelings of others. By the time I had finishedthe Confessions, his most readable book, I felt he was little more than agargantuan egotist—entertaining, as many egotists can be, but in the end notsomeone I wanted to meet. Other books helped in this assessment: Francis King’sThe Magical World of Aleister Crowley and, most of all, John Symonds’s biographyThe Great Beast. I had read Israel Regardie’s riposte to this, The Eye in theTriangle (I had in fact found a copy in Portland, Oregon, while on tour withBlondie) and knew that most Crowleyites held Symonds in low regard. It is clearfrom the start that Symonds has no belief in magic, Crowley’s or anyone else’s.This didn’t bother me. I wasn’t questioning magic, but magick, Crowley’sversion, informed by the “inspired” text he called The Book of the Law andsaturated with his supersized ego.By 1980 I had outgrown Crowley, but not magic, the occult, or esotericism. Ifanything, my interest in these had increased. I moved back to New York and itwas there that I left the Crowley group, and that my interest in esotericismturned elsewhere.3 [index_split_019.html#filepos730298] It was also there thatmy musical career ended. My own band, the Know (the name came from my interestin Gnosticism), hadn’t secured a recording contract, and in 1981 I played guitarwith Iggy Pop on two North American tours. Afterward I discovered that, hard tobelieve, I was tired of sex, drugs, and rock and roll and for a time wasadrift.4 [index_split_019.html#filepos730578] In 1982 I moved back to LA andbegan the slow, sometimes painful transformation from pop star to normal person.It wasn’t until a decade later that I started writing articles and book reviewsfor Gnosis magazine and other journals. In 1996 I moved to London, and in 2001my first book, Turn Off Your Mind, an “occult history” of the 1960s, came out.Crowley is a kind of éminence grise throughout the book, his influencepermeating much of the mystic decade, and I also wrote a short essay on him fora later book, A Dark Muse, about the occult and literature. In London’s occultmilieu I met many people interested in Crowley. In 2008 I wrote an article onCrowley for Fortean Times, spelling out my criticisms.5[index_split_019.html#filepos730901] In 2009 I was asked to host the OccultureFestival, a revue of occult and magical performances, mostly of a Crowleyannature. In the same year, I wrote a long essay on Kenneth Anger, a filmmakerdeeply influenced by Crowley, for the British Film Institute’s DVD box set ofhis films, and interviewed Anger onstage at London’s National Film Theatre. Andin 2011 and 2012 with some musician friends, I performed a live sound track toRex Ingram’s 1926 silent film The Magician, which is based on Somerset Maugham’snovel of the same name, and which features a black magician modeled on Crowley.I also gave lectures in London and Trondheim, Norway, on Crowley’s impact onhorror films, and contributed an essay about him for a book about his lastdays.6 [index_split_019.html#filepos731113] So although I was no longer a fan ofthe Beast, I still moved in his circles, so to speak.It was while researching my essay for the book about Crowley’s last days that Inoticed that something had changed in the way he was being perceived. Over theyears an academic interest in the occult had sprung up and I was surprised todiscover there was such a thing as “Crowley studies,” with conferences andsymposiums dedicated to the Beast. In fact, I gave a talk at one of these,sponsored by the O.T.O.7 [index_split_019.html#filepos731409] Crowley wasbecoming respectable, at least in academic circles, a complete change from howhe was perceived when I first read him. Even as prestigious a publisher as theOxford University Press had published a collection of academic articles on theBeast—ironic, as in 1930 Crowley had been banned from giving a lecture atOxford.8 [index_split_019.html#filepos731591] Several new biographies hadappeared, all of which seemed aimed at rehabilitating Crowley, at least atexonerating him of the worst stains on his reputation. Their basic message wasthat the Devil is not as black as he is painted, and at least one of them runs aclose second to Crowley’s own “hagiography” (biography of a saint), theConfessions, in singing his praises and celebrating him as one of the mostimportant thinkers and mystics of the twentieth century.I wondered: was I missing something? I had by then written about several majorfigures in the esoteric world, critical studies of Rudolf Steiner, MadameBlavatsky, P. D. Ouspensky, and C. G. Jung. Although popular and influential,none of them had made the same impact on “youth culture” as Crowley had—none,that is, had found themselves a posthumous life as a pop icon as the Beast hadclearly become. Today, the image of Crowley with shaven head and bulging eyesthat the Beatles put on the cover of Sgt. Pepper’s is almost as familiar as thatof Marilyn Monroe or Che Guevara. One can almost see Crowley as the subject ofone of Andy Warhol’s famous celebrity prints, and T-shirts with Crowley’s imageare almost as familiar as those with the Ramones. Why had Crowley found a secureplace in pop iconography, when other spiritual teachers from the mysticdecade—like Jung and Blavatsky—had not? After all, it was in that milieu that Ifirst discovered him. And why was the general attitude toward him changing? WasCrowley really the victim of the yellow press, of rumor and downright falsehood,as much of the new literature on him claimed? Was he a misunderstood genius, amaligned philosophical warrior fighting for mankind’s spiritual liberation? Washe so ahead of his time that only a handful of followers could appreciate hismessage? Did he really bring to humanity a sacred scripture, revealed to him byan alien intelligence that, at least according to him, was so beyond our humanmind as to be practically incomprehensible? And was he the prophet of a worldreligion, thelema (Greek for “will”), that presaged an orgiastic new age, inwhich a free mankind would celebrate light, life, liberty, and love, the comingera of “the crowned and conquering child”?My own belief is no. As odd as it sounds, Crowley, I think, really didn’t knowhis own true will and spent a lifetime pursuing a phantom. He was a man of greattalent, frequent brilliance, and occasional genius who wasted himself in anadolescent rage against authority and a justification of every whim of hisinsatiable ego. Crowley’s life is full of tragedies but this may be the mosttragic thing of all. The Chinese philosopher Mencius said that the great manfollows the part of himself that is great, the little man follows the part ofhimself that is little. Crowley had equal parts of both, and it was the part ofhim that was great that inspired loyalty in followers and friends and fueled himwhen faced with failure and defeat. But when it came down to the wire, moretimes than not, Crowley followed the part of himself that was little. As hisfriend Louis Wilkinson said, he was “a great man manqué,” something that in raremoments of insight, Crowley himself recognized.9[index_split_019.html#filepos731835] Crowley could master the arts of magick,could discipline himself to the rigors of meditation and yoga, and could facethe elements with a fortitude most of us could not muster. But when it came tothe most difficult challenge of all, his relations with other human beings,Crowley invariably took the line of least resistance, opting for the easy tacticof putting the blame for his own shortcomings onto someone else. He may not havebeen “the wickedest man in the world,” as John Bull, a British tabloid of the1920s, dubbed him, but it seems he often tried to fit that bill. Crowley couldclimb Himalayas of the earth and mind, but as most people familiar with his lifediscover, he fell perilously short at the Great Work of being human.If this was all there was to Crowley, there would be little reason to study him.Egotists are not rare, and all of us fall short of what we could be. It is theother side of Crowley that makes him interesting, that side interested inexploring the unknown regions of ourselves. He had a vague insight that humanitysells itself short, and that we could all be so much more. It was this thatfirst drew me to him. It is also this that raises questions. How Crowley wentabout discovering that more warrants criticism. He is, I believe, a kind of“test case” for a philosophy of life that has become the default alternative tothe bland “normality” he did everything he could to outrage. It is a philosophyand ethic that, for sake of a better term, I call “liberationist.” Its messageis that if we can only rid ourselves of all repression, all inhibitions, allhang-ups, all authority, then the Golden Age will miraculously appear. It is anantinomian philosophy (“against the norms”) that reaches for some ethos “beyondgood and evil.” Crowley is not its only representative; he has a place in apantheon of characters that includes the Marquis de Sade, Arthur Rimbaud,Georges Bataille, Charles Manson, Jim Morrison, Kurt Cobain, and countless otherindividuals who wanted to “let it all hang out,” to “break on through to theother side” and “transgress.” But he is the one who took it to its extreme, andby doing so, showed that it doesn’t work. I believe we owe him a debt of thanksfor this.Crowley did have insight into the hidden powers of the mind and into thatstrange other reality he called “magick,” and in his own tumultuous way, hetried to awaken the sleeping godhead inside himself and in others. Howsuccessful he was is debatable. To my mind Crowley is more of a symptom than aprophet, and an object lesson in how not to find one’s “true will,” whateverthat ambiguous phrase may mean. In this critical look at the Great Beast, I willtry to show why this is so."},{"pageContent":"ONETHE UNFORGIVABLE SIN> [images/00004.jpg] In recent years visitors to London’s National Portrait Gallery may have wonderedabout a painting that was added to its collection in 2003. There amid portraitsof Winston Churchill, Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, Frederick Delius, RalphVaughan Williams, Ernest Shackleton, Ernest Rutherford, and other importantBritish figures is a striking canvas whose bright colors and unusual subjectjump out at the viewer. The portrait shows its subject in a yogic pose, thefingers of both hands curled in a chin mudra, a meditative gesture designed toaid in pranayama, a breathing technique to gather the vital force, or prana, inthe body. A bright red robe drapes over the figure, his dark hair and eyebrowscontrasting strongly with the golden-yellow backdrop, and a single blackforelock offers a faint suggestion of a horn. Not much is known about theartist, Leon Engers Kennedy, but like his subject he was interested inmysticism, magic, and the stranger side of life. The portrait was done in NewYork in 1917, during the subject’s difficult years in America, and a look at thebiographical note tells us that he was a writer, mountaineer, and occultist. Healso had a taste for adopting names, at different times calling himself theMaster Therion, the Great Beast 666, and Baphomet.The portrait is of Aleister Crowley although the curators, no doubt sticklersfor accuracy, have him down as “Edward Alexander (‘Aleister’) Crowley,” a namethat on some occasions, usually legal ones, he did, in fact, use. When I visitedthe gallery not too long ago for the first time in some years and came uponCrowley’s image, the same one used as the frontispiece for Vol. III No. I of hismagical magazine The Equinox (the “blue Equinox” as it is called), I wassurprised that it was there, and at first couldn’t believe it. The NationalPortrait Gallery was established in 1856 with the idea of collecting portraitsof “famous British men and women.” But surely Crowley wasn’t just famous. He wasinfamous. A black magician, drug addict, sexual pervert, traitor, and all-aroundtroublemaker—Crowley, famous? That the curators of a gallery designed to houseBritain’s best and brightest should include the “wickedest man in the world”struck me as odd, almost aberrant. It was as if they had discovered a portraitof Jack the Ripper and decided to hang that, too.Crowley was no Ripper, although there is more than a little suspicion that hewas responsible for some deaths, and Crowley himself went out of his way tosuggest this. Yet during the height of Crowley’s infamy, in the 1920s and ’30s,the idea that his portrait could hang in the same room as the painter Roger Fry,the socialite Lady Ottoline Morrell, and the biologist Julian Huxley (brother ofAldous Huxley) as an example of a famous Briton would have been unthinkable. Hewas indeed “A Man We’d Like to Hang,” as an article in the newspaper John Bull,which had a peculiar hatred of Crowley, called him, but certainly not in thatway.1 [index_split_019.html#filepos732158] More likely Crowley’s portrait wouldhave found a place on Scotland Yard’s “most wanted” list, if John Bull and theother scandal sheets that “exposed” his exploits had it their way. Nevertheless,I had to chuckle. Although Crowley did practically everything he could todisgust and infuriate the British society he loathed with an often tediousobstinancy, he also always wanted its acceptance, and to be taken for what henever quite was: an English gentleman. I wondered, assuming he still existed insome sentient form in the cosmos—he was a great believer in reincarnation andclaimed quite a few prestigious names for his past lives—musn’t he be chuckling,too, seeing that he had finally been accepted into the club that for the longesttime wouldn’t have him as a member?If we have any doubt that the Great Beast is finding a new place for himself inBritish history, we have only to look at the 2002 BBC Poll of the Top 100Britons. Crowley came in at number 73, beating out J.R.R. Tolkien, JohnnyRotten, Chaucer, and Sir Walter Raleigh, among others. Crowley is in danger ofbecoming just another English eccentric, which is how the British public usuallyneutralizes some challenge to its complacency.2[index_split_019.html#filepos732339] When I mentioned this to a friend, he addedthat the next step is to be deemed a national treasure. With Crowley’s imagehanging among the portraits of many other national treasures, it looks like heis indeed on his way.—THAT CROWLEY was an egotist and mistreated the people in his life—was, indeed,wicked—are not the most important aspects of his career. Other less interestingcharacters have done the same without having Crowley’s flashes of genius,although, to be sure, Crowley’s ignominy was considerable. Yet for all hisinexcusable behavior, Crowley was not “evil,” in the sense that, say, SherlockHolmes’s adversary, Professor Moriarty, was, or the black magicians of the manyoccult horror films that Crowley inspired were. Crowley was not evil, onlyinsensitive, selfish, and driven by a hunger he seemed unable to satisfy and anincorrigible need to be distracted. He seems an embodiment of the religiousthinker Blaise Pascal’s remark that “All human evil comes from a single cause,man’s inability to sit still in a room.” Crowley never sat still in a room, oranywhere else. One of the most telling remarks Crowley ever made was in a letterhe wrote in 1905 to his then friend and soon to be brother-in-law, the artistGerald Kelly. In the midst of a complaint about wasting the last five years ofhis life on “weakness, miscalled politeness, tact, discretion, care for thefeeling of others”—a mistake he would not make again—and a rejection ofChristianity, rationalism, Buddhism, and “all the lumber of the centuries,”Crowley speaks of a “positive and primeval fact, Magic”—he had not yet added thek—with which he will build “a new Heaven and a new Earth.” “I want none of yourfaint approval or faint dispraise,” he told Kelly. “I want blasphemy, murder,rape, revolution, anything good or bad, but strong.”3[index_split_019.html#filepos732591] Crowley needed “strong” things. Nothingcould touch him unless it was “strong.” Crowley had to have a lot of sex and ithad to be wild; the women he had it with had to be seething with “forbiddenlust” of the kind associated with the Marquis de Sade or the poet Baudelaire,and the men he had it with had to humiliate him and bend him to their will. Hehad to have a lot of drugs; famously, by the end of his life he was takingenough heroin to kill a room full of nonusers. He had to have a lot of drink; hewas known to hold an eye-watering amount of liquor. And he had to have a lot ofexperiences. Crowley’s life was one long hunt for “experiences.” As hisbiographer and critic John Symonds remarked, Crowley “needed some strong orhorrific experience to get ‘turned on.’”4 [index_split_019.html#filepos732907]Most people, as Symonds remarks, are “turned on”—become interested insomething—by sitting at home, reading a book, listening to music, or watching afilm. That is, most people embody some form of Pascal’s “sitting still in aroom.” Crowley’s need for constant “strong” stimulation suggests that he lackedimagination and that his mind, formidable as it was, was curiously literal.Crowley seems, I think, to have suffered from a kind of autism. I don’tnecessarily mean in some pathological sense, but he seemed to lack the kind ofnuanced, “tacit knowing” that most of us enjoy and that allows us to grasp theessence or meaning of some idea or experience, without having to go to extremesor into precise detail in order to “get it.” Crowley only got it by going toextremes. In fact, as his friend Louis Wilkinson, who shared with Crowley someof his worst traits, remarked, Crowley’s “cult, his mania, one might say, wasfor excess in all directions.”5 [index_split_019.html#filepos733060] Crowley wasnot evil, but his need for excess, for “strong” things, more times than not, wasa source of suffering for those around him.It may be this characteristic that leads some of Crowley’s recent biographers toremark that his credo of “Do what thou wilt,” “so redolent, seemingly, oflicense and anarchy, dark deeds and darker dreams, terrifies on first impact, asdoes Crowley the man,” and that one must feel “terror, a sense of evil,creepiness or disgust” at the mention of his name.6[index_split_019.html#filepos733213] This seems a bit extreme itself. With thepossible exception of some fundamentalist Christians, I can’t think of anyonewho is afraid of Crowley anymore, let alone terrified, or who is so conventionalor repressed that they will “experience visceral disgust at the thought ofsexual emissions as sacred components of worship,” as Crowley and those whopracticed his sex magick thought of them.7 [index_split_019.html#filepos733527]We live in an “anything goes” society, whose central maxim, “Just Do It,” hasbeen embraced by some contemporary Crowleyans.8[index_split_019.html#filepos733652] A great deal of what Crowley got up to istoday par for the course, and the extreme behavior he indulged in is, more orless, commonplace. But the important question is: does one have to be frightenedof thelema, the name of Crowley’s religion of excess, in order to question it?It strikes me that in order to portray Crowley as some liberator of an uptightmankind—as some of his champions do—our “fear” of the shocking truths he wassent to reveal must be puffed up, and a kind of straw Mr. Conventional must beerected, who trembles at the thought of anyone doing their “true will.” Suchimaginary Mrs. Grundys are, in fact, necessary for a philosophy of“transgression.”9 [index_split_019.html#filepos734071] They are the windmillsagainst which such radical behavior tilts. It needs them to rebel against;without them, it collapses, its “acts of liberation” deflating to mere personalpredilections, its “transgressions” indicating little more than that the peopleengaging in them have a taste for such things. But no such persons exist, onlypeople who wonder if the kind of life Crowley led is really worth living. I havenever been afraid of my or anyone else’s “true will,” and I have lived in boththe magical and rock and roll milieus that provide fertile soil for those whoare pursuing theirs. This is why I can be critical of Crowley and theliberationist philosophy he embodied—thelema is only one expression of it; it isnot a distinctive new creed—and not be dismissed as someone terrified of it. Ihave been there, done it, and seen it from the inside. I am not a thelemaphobe,to coin a word. I merely find it wrongheaded.But “excess in all directions?” Sounds like a good album title. No wonderCrowley found a place in rock and roll.—EDWARD ALEXANDER CROWLEY was born on October 12, 1875, in Leamington Spa,Warwickshire, England. Crowley claimed that his family was of Celtic origins,associating his father’s bloodline with a Breton family of de Quérouaille, whichproduced a Duchess of Portsmouth, and also linking it with the name de Kerval,one of many used in later life. The lineage has been questioned, and Crowleyoffers very little evidence in support of the claim. But even if untrue, ittells us something important: that Crowley was a snob. Crowley begins the workhe considered his masterpiece, Magick in Theory and Practice, by telling us thatit is “for all . . . every man, woman, and child,” and that he has written it inorder to help “the Banker, the Pugilist, the Biologist, the Poet, the Navvy, theGrocer, the Factory Girl, the Mathematician” and many others “fulfill themselvesperfectly, each in his or her own proper function.”10[index_split_019.html#filepos734368] But Crowley had no idea what motivated “theBanker” or “the Factory Girl,” and the fact that he represents these people incapitals suggests they are merely stock figures, allegories, not real humanbeings. This is also why he was not a good novelist: Crowley had no interest inother people. As Louis Wilkinson remarked, Crowley “wanted to appeal to thegeneral reader but he never could because he knew nothing about him.”11[index_split_019.html#filepos734582] Given this, it is no surprise that the workCrowley considered “for all” quickly turns into a labyrinth of self-allusion, ahall of mirrors reflecting Crowley’s self-obsession. And the fact that Crowleywants to help “the Grocer,” “the Golfer,” “the Wife” fit into “his or her properfunction”—as if one was nothing but a grocer, golfer, or wife—suggests that forall his talk of freedom, there is something fatalistic, even totalitarian aboutCrowley’s notion of the “true will,” a point we will return to later on.In a footnote in Crowley’s Confessions, he comments about his birth that “it hasbeen remarked a strange coincidence that one small county should have givenEngland her two greatest poets—for one must not forget Shakespeare.”12[index_split_019.html#filepos734736] Yet Crowley himself forgot Shakespeareenough to get his birth year wrong, giving us 1550 rather than 1564, adding agood fourteen years to the Bard’s life. But of course the remark has nothing todo with remembering Shakespeare. It is an opportunity for Crowley to exhibit hischaracteristic humor and inordinate self-esteem, which itself suggests a senseof inferiority, one, apparently, that was not salved even by Crowley becoming agod. This he believed he achieved in 1921, when he reached the grade ofIpsissimus, the ultimate rank in the magical totem pole of occult enlightenmenthe spent half of his adult life climbing. Another sign of Crowley’s snobbishnessis that he claimed that at birth he displayed the “distinguishing marks of aBuddha.” As far as I can tell, the marks Crowley offers—being tongue-tied,having a “characteristic membrane” that required an operation, and four chesthairs in the form of a swastika—have nothing to do with a Buddha, or anythingelse, and we can accept this remark with as much salt as we do his suggestionthat his birth in some way compensates for Columbus’s discovery of America,which also happened on October 12. But the point is clear: right from the start,there was something special about Crowley.His actual lineage, although not as exalted, was not particularly humble,although Crowley always felt some need to claim an aristocratic background. Hewas born into a family of Plymouth Brethren, a sect of extreme Christianfundamentalism that was founded in the late 1820s. The Plymouth Brethrenbelieved in the literal truth of the Bible and had a dour view of life. Not onlydid the “apocalyptic-minded Plymouth Brethren” anticipate “the imminent end ofthe world with smug satisfaction,” they also considered Christmas a paganholiday and refused to celebrate it.13 [index_split_019.html#filepos734890] Thefamily started each day by reading aloud a chapter from the Bible; the servants,too, joined in and Crowley’s own impressive familiarity with Scripture no doubtstems from this practice. Crowley’s parents eagerly anticipated the coming Dayof Judgment, when everyone except the members of their flock would be chastisedwith hellfire—much like the readers of today’s popular Left Behind series ofapocalyptic novels. Crowley’s own literalism, and his belief in a comingapocalypse—the world, he later claimed, was destroyed by fire on March 21,1904—may have its roots in his family’s beliefs, and it is not too difficult tosee in Crowley’s later ministry both a reversal and an emulation of the creed inwhich he was raised.Crowley’s father, Edward, came from a wealthy brewing family; having inherited afortune, he was a “gentleman of leisure,” with no need to work. Crowley tells ushis father was an engineer, but that he never practiced his profession.Crowley’s grandfather had made a fortune in beer and the proceeds hadprecipitated to his son. In the mid–nineteenth century, Crowley Alehouses couldbe found dotted around the country. At them one could order beer, sandwiches,and bread and cheese. They were popular lunching places that offered analternative to the less salubrious public houses, and the income that allowedCrowley’s father—and soon enough Crowley himself—ample leisure was founded onthe appetites and thirsts of clerks and other office workers. Crowley wasembarrassed by the source of the wealth he enjoyed as a boy and that he quicklyran through as a young man, and he makes no mention of it in his Confessions.Like his son, Crowley’s father used his leisure for the serious purpose ofreligion; he became a popular and successful proselytizer for the PlymouthBrethren cause, evangelizing across the countryside, often bringing his son onthese recruitment drives. Also like his son, Edward Crowley was a prolificwriter, producing pamphlets on the resurrection, the “end times,” and othersimilar topics. Crowley caught the proselytizing fever early on. He accepted thecreed of his parents wholesale, and could not imagine anyone so wicked as toreject it. Again, it has not escaped the attention of people writing on Crowleythat father and son shared an interest in intoxicating substances andspirituality, although Crowley exceeded his father in both concerns, and for atime Crowley’s father was a teetotaler, exercising an abstinence Crowley himselfrarely displayed.Crowley thought of his father as a hero and as a friend and there is asuggestion that he exaggerated his importance in the Plymouth Brethren.14[index_split_019.html#filepos735141] Crowley speaks of him as being a“magnificently eloquent” preacher, yet in an early work, The World’s Tragedy, inwhich he sums up his youth as a “Boyhood in Hell,” Crowley parodies him.15[index_split_019.html#filepos735295] As one writer suggests, Crowley’s fatherseems to have possessed a high degree of vitality and dominance—he was aforceful personality who could impose himself on others, much as Crowley himselfdid—and this made up, in Crowley’s mind, for his narrow-mindedness andintolerance. No such equivocation informs Crowley’s view of his mother, whom hedescribes as a “brainless bigot of the most narrow, logical and inhuman type.”16[index_split_019.html#filepos735449] Crowley may have hero-worshipped hisfather, but the real emotional knot was with his mother.Emily Crowley, née Bishop, was raised in Devon and Somerset, and her Asianappearance led to her being called the “little Chinese girl,” a fact that mayhave helped shape her son’s later predilection for exotic women. She had anartistic bent and painted watercolors, but was very strict and seemed to lack asense of humor, especially about herself. Although research has shown that untilher death in 1917, Crowley was in many ways a dutiful son—at least he wrote herregularly—his remarks about her are uniformly critical. On one occasion duringan excursion to Beachy Head—a chalk headland on England’s south coast thatbecame one of Crowley’s favorite climbing spots—he had a premonition that shewas in danger and saved her from falling off a cliff. He described this act as a“regrettable incident of impulsive humanitarianism,” an extravagance that inlater life he avoided.17 [index_split_019.html#filepos735575] But along withemphasizing his dislike of his mother—he was, he says, physically repelled byher—Crowley’s act of heroism points out that Crowley was a natural psychic; atleast he had an access to information that we would call “paranormal.” This“natural magic” appeared in later years when he dreamed of his mother’s death.In his diary for May 6, 1917, he wrote that “Had news of my mother’s act death.Two nights before news had dreamed that she was dead.”18[index_split_019.html#filepos735701] Crowley experienced a similar dream beforehis father’s death. In the diary note about his mother, he says that this dreamalso came two nights before his father’s death, but in the Confessions he writesthat it came on the same night. Edward Crowley died on March 5, 1887. Crowleywrites, “On the night of March 5th, the boy—away at school—dreamed that hisfather was dead.”19 [index_split_019.html#filepos735866] Crowley remarks that hehad many times dreamed that his mother was dead; given his feeling toward her,this is understandable. But the dream he had directly before her death sharedwith the dream he had about his father a peculiar character, a quality “entirelydifferent from anything he had known.”20 [index_split_019.html#filepos736206]This suggests that although we may question the philosophy of magick thatCrowley developed in later years, it seems clear that he had some naturalpredilection for it, something he shared with his contemporary C. G. Jung, whoalso dreamed of his parents’ deaths.21 [index_split_019.html#filepos736327]Edward Crowley died when his son was eleven—strangely, the same age MadameBlavatsky was when her mother died. It was then that the embryo of the laterWickedest Man in the World began to stir. Until then young Alick—he hated thename—was a model child and extremely well behaved. “The mind of the child wasalmost abnormally normal,” Crowley tells us. Yet he did have some curioustraits. The Bible was the only book available to him, and he became fascinatedwith the Book of Revelations, feeling solidarity with the Dragon, the FalseProphet, and, predictably, the Beast and the Scarlet Woman; the antinomiansensibility that informed his later philosophy took root early. He alsodeveloped a taste for descriptions of torture and suffering, and speaks of a“congenital masochism”; he admits that the “fantasy of desiring to be hurt” haspersisted into his adult years.22 [index_split_019.html#filepos736519] In hislater magical life, Crowley wallowed in the notion of being mistreated by women,a desire that reached an apex during his time in Sicily, and may have been somecompensatory mechanism for the explicit low estimate he had of the sex. Crowleyemphasizes the masochistic element in his makeup, but he had a sadistic streakas well. Reading of the Indian Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, Crowley imagined himself asNana Sahib, a rebel who took part in massacring British troops and civilians.Sahib’s “proud, fierce, cruel, sensual profile” was his ideal of beauty—hereCrowley is reminiscent of the Japanese novelist Yukio Mishima—and he imaginedbecoming his ally.23 [index_split_019.html#filepos736678] He wanted to “share intorturing prisoners,” but also to “suffer at his hands.” A cousin who playedwith Crowley shared this fantasy and asked him to “be cruel to me.”24[index_split_019.html#filepos736903] Crowley’s “aristocratic” leanings tookshape also when, at six, the family moved to Redhill, in Surrey. Here he playedgames in which he and his playmates—like him, other Plymouth Brethren childrenwho were taught by tutors—hid in order to ambush the children from the localschool, whom they called cads. Here also began Crowley’s penchant forplayacting; he pretended to be famous people of the moment, a taste for adoptingalter egos that lasted throughout his life.Young Alick, for all his sadomasochistic fantasies, may have been abnormallynormal, but with the death of his father from cancer of the tongue—a tragicaffliction for a preacher—something changed. The transformation began at thefuneral. The family had moved to Southampton in order to be near a clinic thatoffered Count Mattei’s “electro-homeopathy.”25[index_split_019.html#filepos737029] Edward and his Brethren had decided that itwas God’s will that he should receive this treatment and not have the operationthat the eminent surgeon Sir James Paget had advised. 26[index_split_019.html#filepos737349] Crowley was by this time attending a schoolrun by Plymouth Brethren. Practically on his return to school from the funeral,he misbehaved. Exactly what he did is unclear. His punishment was mitigatedbecause of the bereavement but Crowley himself knew he had passed a boundary. Itwas “the first symptom of a complete reversal of his attitude to life.”27[index_split_019.html#filepos737559] Nothing like this had happened before, butit happened quite a bit from then on.Crowley’s change in his attitude did not mean a rejection of the PlymouthBrethren belief. It merely meant that he had changed sides. Crowley supporterspoint out that it is inaccurate to speak of him as a Satanist, yet Crowleyhimself is no help in this matter. Trying to understand the reversal that hadtaken place in him, Crowley said, “I simply went over to Satan’s side; and tothis hour I cannot tell why.”28 [index_split_019.html#filepos737713] Fromwanting to emulate Jesus and to “lead a life of holiness,” Crowley now felt“passionately eager to serve my new master.” “I was anxious to distinguishmyself by committing sin.”29 [index_split_019.html#filepos737839]An incident that occurred at this time suggests a connection. As any intelligentyoung boy would, Crowley asked one of his instructors how Jesus could have spentthree days and three nights in his tomb, when he was crucified on a Friday andresurrected on a Sunday. Surely it should be only two nights? His teachercouldn’t answer and admitted that it had never been explained. Crowley decidedthat he would do it. This decision, he said, is “very characteristic.” He has,he says, no interest in doing what has already been done, but “tell me of analleged impossibility; and . . . I am out to do it.”30[index_split_019.html#filepos737960] This is an example of Crowley’s literalism,a dogged persistence that in some ways is admirable but in others tedious. “Ihave always been singularly thorough in anything I take up,” he tells us, and hegives us an example: His father had a favorite sermon on the word but. Crowleywent through the whole Bible, “page by page, enclosing this word, wherever itoccurred, with an oblong of ink.”31 [index_split_019.html#filepos738086] Thisshows his tendency to go to inordinate lengths to prove a point, a tenacity thatmade him such a bad enemy. Crowley could hold a grudge for years. Rememberingthe ill treatment he had received at Ebor School in Cambridge nearly a halfcentury earlier, he wrote in his Confessions that soon after he left, theheadmaster, Rev. H. d’Arcy Champney, went insane and the school closed down.Neither recollection was accurate but Crowley enjoyed vilifying his enemies;pages of his Confessions are dedicated to this type of revenge. This manicpersistence appeared in gruesome detail when, at fourteen, deciding to provewhether or not a cat really had nine lives, Crowley submitted one to arsenic,chloroform, hanging, gassing, stabbing, slashing, smashing, burning, anddrowning, before finally throwing it out a window. The stupidity is numbing butit shows the autistic exactitude that Crowley often displayed.The idea of doing the impossible informed the new dispensation that had changedhis life. No petty sin would do for him. He wanted the ultimate sin. This wasknown as the sin against the Holy Ghost. No one knew exactly what this was, butit was unforgivable, the worst you could do, and it was for precisely thatreason that Crowley pursued it. He must, he said, discover this sin and “do itvery thoroughly.”32 [index_split_019.html#filepos738212] It was the work of alifetime.Crowley’s adolescent “revaluation of values” seemed to set in motion a worldthat turned against young Alick. At Ebor School in Cambridge, snitching wasrewarded, and Crowley was accused of being found drunk at home at the bottom ofthe stairs. Neither Crowley nor his mother was asked about this. It was untrue,but the headmaster simply accepted the accusation and Crowley was “sent toCoventry”—that is, everyone ignored him. No explanation was given. This,combined with a bread-and-water diet and inordinate physical exercise, continuedfor a term and a half. Crowley’s health suffered and he had to be removed. Thedoctor advised travel in the open air and instruction by a tutor. Crowleyenjoyed hiking, mountain climbing, and fishing in Wales and Scotland; thistherapeutic outdoors life laid the foundation for his later mountaineering andworld travels.By this time his mother had moved to London, to be near her brother, Tom Bishop,who became Crowley’s guardian. Tom Bond Bishop, another Plymouth Brethrenfanatic, was in every way as narrow-minded and intolerant as his sister, andCrowley loathed him from the start. What Crowley hated most about Uncle Tom washis “invulnerable cocksureness.” “He knew that he was right on every point.”33[index_split_019.html#filepos738338] Crowley had become a keen climber and heasked Uncle Tom what a climber should do if another he was roped to fell, and hecould not save him, and could save himself only by cutting the rope. Uncle Tominsisted that God would never allow such a thing to happen.After attending a day school in Streatham, South London, where Crowleydiscovered masturbation—to which he applied himself “with characteristicvigor”—Crowley was taught by tutors chosen by Bishop. Petty and punctilious,they were a challenge to Crowley’s goal of committing the ultimate sin. Onetutor, Reverend Fothergill, tried to drown Crowley in a loch in Scotland afterAlick threw him out of a boat. Crowley got revenge by finding his way to whatwould become his favorite sin. That evening a village girl lingered with himamid the heather. When he and the girl returned together openly, his tutor gaveup and took him back to London. He had another dose of sin when, en route,stopping overnight in Carlisle, he enjoyed the favors of a chambermaid.Crowley’s next tutor was the brother of the Dean of Westminster. Apparently, he,too, had a taste for sin and tried to seduce young Alick. Crowley says that heresisted, not because he wasn’t inclined—Crowley was strongly bisexual—butbecause he thought he was being set up. The tutor later apologized and explainedthat he had been led astray by an elder brother, who was a Christian missionary.The incident secured in Crowley the belief that all clergymen are secretlylechers.One tutor, however, seems to have penetrated Uncle Tom’s screening process.Archibald Douglas, a Bible salesman and a graduate of Oxford, was the closestthing to a normal person that Crowley had encountered. He introduced Crowley tosmoking, drinking, gambling, billiards, and women. Douglas showed Crowley “asane, clean, jolly world worth living in,” and it is tempting to speculate onhow Crowley might have turned out if he were allowed to live in it longer.34[index_split_019.html#filepos738459] With Douglas, Crowley behaved like a“normal, healthy human being,” and the two enjoyed an excursion to the sea. InTorquay, a seaside town in Devon, Crowley met an actress and fell in love; forten days “the detestable mysteries of sex were transformed into joy and beauty.”“The nightmare world of Christianity vanished” and “the obsession of sin fellfrom my shoulders into the sea of oblivion.”35[index_split_019.html#filepos738585] But this beatitude was short lived. UncleTom found the two and dismissed Douglas; apparently letters back home suggestedCrowley was too happy. Alick was returned to the world of guilt and repression.But it was too late. He had tasted real life and wanted more of it.Crowley’s next act of sin was his most heinous yet. Sometime in his teens,Crowley seduced the parlor maid on his mother’s bed. It was probably not toodifficult; the girl seemed to have designs on Crowley herself. Israel Regardiesuggests that this shows that Crowley had Oedipal desires for his mother. Thisis doubtful: what it tells us is that for Crowley, sex was an act of rebellion.Crowley’s sexual relations with women remained acts of defiance against hisChristian-Victorian upbringing, which is why they rarely contained any of theaffection and intimacy that, along with sex, make up most male/femalerelationships. There was something deliciously wicked about sex—there must be,if the Plymouth Brethren disapproved of it—and the fact that Crowley was havingit on his mother’s bed made it even more so. For the rest of his life Crowleycouldn’t think of sex without feeling a frisson of “forbiddenness,” and a sensethat in having it he was shaking his fist at some vague “authority” thatprevented him from enjoying himself. The danger, however, in enjoying“forbiddenness” is that it forces you to remain a child, and this,paradoxically, enforces the very authority you are rebelling against. Only achild is interested in doing what some authority tells him he shouldn’t, andonly a child gets excited by being “naughty.” (This is why “transgressors” needthe normality against which they transgress; they would not be “transgressing”otherwise.) In his attitude toward sex, Crowley remained a child—he was inJungian terms a puer aeternus, an eternal child, or Peter Pan—and it is nosurprise that he later called his coming new age the era of “the crowned andconquering child.”The outcome of Crowley’s latest sin also casts him in a bad light. For somereason, the parlor maid told Uncle Tom about their liaison. Crowley deniedeverything, but Uncle Tom insisted that he prove he was not with her. Crowleygot a tobacconist to say that at the time the girl said she was with Alick, hewas actually in his shop, buying tobacco. This, too, was forbidden, but Crowleyfeigned remorse and said bad companions had led him astray. Accepting guilt forthis imaginary but lesser crime was a clever ploy. Uncle Tom believed him, andthe girl was seen as a liar and dismissed. Crowley had shaken his fist atauthority, gotten rid of the girl he had seduced, and come away innocent. It wasa tactic of getting others to take the blame for his actions that served himwell in later life.Crowley tells us that at some point during his descent into sin, his mother wasso scandalized by his behavior that she called him the Beast 666, from the Bookof Revelation. The story may be apocryphal—he doesn’t mention his mother’sfateful christening until nearly the midpoint of the Confessions—and as we’veseen, Crowley himself was a fan of the Beast from early on.36[index_split_019.html#filepos738706] No doubt he spoke with his mother about hissense of identification with this demonic individual; since there was littleelse but the Bible to discuss, it was bound to come up. Children, we know, needrole models. Crowley had one with his father, then lost him. Uncle Tom wasn’t inthe running and so this station fell to this mythical embodiment of all that wasanti-Christian. If indeed Emily Crowley was responsible for her son’s satanicself-image, he did his mother proud and lived up to this sobriquet with gusto.—CROWLEY’S REBELLION CONTINUED as he made his way out of his teens. At sixteen hewas sent to Malvern public school in Worcestershire, where he stayed for threeterms. The school proved just as bad as the one in Cambridge. (A public schoolin England is a fee-paying one as opposed to a free state school.) Crowley soonlearned that in order to protect himself, he had to use the same tactics asthose of his enemies. In order to avoid a beating by a prefect—another studentgiven some authority over his peers, rather like a trustee in prison—Crowleyfound himself in the housemaster’s office, pouring out accusations against theprefect and the rest of his schoolmates. Crowley claims this snitching was onlyin self-defense, but the fact that he informed on all his schoolmates and notonly the prefect suggests that he was trying to “get in good” with theauthorities. His “orgy of tale-telling” understandably made him unpopular and in1892 his mother was forced to take him out.37[index_split_019.html#filepos738838]At the public school in Tonbridge in Kent, where he was next sent, things werenot much better, but at seventeen Crowley had recovered his health and wasturning into an athletic, formidable figure who could throw his weight around.He felt that he possessed a “natural aristocracy” that made people fear him.This only fueled his pursuit of the unforgivable sin even more, and he addedanother notch to his belt when he caught gonorrhea from a Glasgow prostitute.Crowley was fast becoming a fin de siècle juvenile delinquent, a late-Victorian“rebel without a pause,” who was not particularly liked by his schoolmates, andthough capable, did not apply himself to his studies. Like most intelligentpeople, he was bored with whatever didn’t interest him. After Tonbridge hismother sent him to live with a Plymouth Brethren family in Eastbourne,overlooking the English Channel. Beachy Head, his early favorite climbing place,was nearby. He attended Eastbourne College, where he developed an interest inand a talent for science, assisting the chemistry professor in the laboratory.Crowley’s methodical mind was well suited for scientific work, and it isinteresting to consider the possibility that, had he not decided on a career ofsin, he would have made a good scientist. In later years the analogies he useswhen trying to explain his philosophical and metaphysical beliefs are usuallycouched in mathematical and chemical terms. Another lifelong interest thatdeveloped in Eastbourne was chess. Crowley taught himself the game and he soonbecame the best player in town, beating the local champion and contributing achess column to a local newspaper. Chess, like science and mathematics, alsorequires a methodical, logical mind and that Crowley excelled at it—at one pointhe even saw it as a career—suggests that his own talents lay more in thatdirection than in the one he actually chose in life.At Eastbourne, too, his interest in climbing became a passion. On a trip to Skyein Scotland, he went rock climbing. In Langdale, in Cumbria, in the northwest ofEngland, he climbed four of the highest fells in one day. The great outdoorssuited Crowley; he enjoyed its rigors throughout his life, a sign that for allhis later drug-filled adventures, he had a basic appetite for healthy exertion.Between 1894 and 1898 he made several excursions to the Alps, traveling with atutor to the Suldenthal in the Austrian Tyrol. He became a remarkable, ifunorthodox, climber, and could have made a lasting mark as a mountaineer. EvenJohn Symonds, generally seen as a critic of Crowley, can’t avoid mentioning thatclimbing authorities such as A. F. Mummery, H. V. Reade, and others rankedCrowley high as a climber.38 [index_split_019.html#filepos739080]It was on one of his climbing excursions to the Lake District that Crowley metone of the few people for whom he felt real respect and loyalty, the German-bornmountaineer Oscar Eckenstein.39 [index_split_019.html#filepos739234] Seventeenyears older than Crowley—hence a perfect father figure—Eckenstein was anexperienced climber. Like Crowley, he was an eccentric character. Born in 1859to a German sociologist father and an English mother, Eckenstein took degrees inchemistry in London and Bonn; he later worked as a railway engineer. LikeCrowley, he had a taste for mathematics and shared with his young friend aninsistence on exactitude. Eckenstein dressed oddly for the time, wearing strawsandals, and like Crowley was a fan of Sir Richard Burton, the explorer(Eckenstein later donated his large collection of Burton’s books, documents, andother items to the Royal Asiatic Society). Eckenstein also had an interest inpsychic phenomena, such as telepathy, and there is some suggestion that at somepoint in his career he may have studied under a Sufi master. Crowley claimedthat along with the art of mountaineering—he was, Crowley said, “the bestall-round man in England” and “the greatest climber of his age”—Eckensteintaught him how to use his mind properly, to concentrate, and Eckenstein’sinstructions in visualization aided Crowley’s later magical work.In the end, however, Eastbourne did not prove suitable for the young Beast.Crowley found himself in the middle of a dispute among the Plymouth Brethrenfamily he was staying with. One of the daughters, whom he describes as“beautiful, voluptuous and normal,” was engaged to a young man who wasn’t aPlymouth Brethren.40 [index_split_019.html#filepos739510] To agree to themarriage, the family insisted that their daughter’s suitor convert to theircreed. The young man found that he could not. When he informed the family, anuproar ensued and he was summarily thrown out. From then on, the daughter wassubject to continued abuse—“meals were a poisoned whirlwind”—and at one point,Crowley voiced some misgivings. The abuse was then aimed at him; Crowley evensuggests the family attacked him physically. Asserting his natural aristocracy,Crowley—at least according to his account—soon had them cowed and left. Hepleaded with the girl to leave her home and go to her fiancé. That her brutishfamily should destroy her love was insufferable to him; this sentimentalityinformed his later poetry but not his actual relationships. But she was toobeaten down to oppose them. The family sent a telegram to Uncle Tom and Crowleywas soon on his way home.The one good thing to come of the incident was that his family realized that hehad become too big for them to control. “The best thing they could do,” theysaw, “was to let me go my own way.”41 [index_split_019.html#filepos739665] This,in essence, became the kernel of Crowley’s later philosophy. Years later, whenhe had been thrown out of his abbey by Mussolini and was trying to kick heroinin Tunis, North Africa, Crowley wrote to his faithful disciple Norman Muddcomplaining that the authorities were incessantly thwarting his plans toliberate humanity. “The essential for ourselves,” he told Mudd, “is to put astop absolutely to this damned impertinent interference with us.”42[index_split_019.html#filepos739792] That “impertinent” conveys Crowley’saristocratic sense and in the context—exiled, strung out, and broke—is almostcomic. But this was the aim of his entire magical system. He should be left todo what he wanted. “The word of sin is restriction,” Crowley told the world adecade after this family squabble. The source of this doubtful maxim was,Crowley tells us, a superior extrahuman intelligence, but its roots were in avery human affair and they were planted in a very human teenager in Eastbourne.Crowley had by this time developed a love of poetry. His early reading wasstrictly supervised by his mother. Reading on Sunday was forbidden. Ofcontemporary authors, he was allowed Sir Walter Scott, enormously popular inCrowley’s childhood, and some Charles Dickens. David Copperfield, however, wasbanned because one of the characters, Little Em’ly, shared his mother’s name,and to read of this “naughty girl” would be disrespectful. One tutor wasdisciplined for reading Coleridge’s The Rime of the Ancient Mariner aloud afterdinner. The Ancient Mariner “blesses unawares” the water snakes following hisship; snakes are cursed in Genesis, his mother explained, and were responsiblefor Original Sin. We can appreciate Crowley’s resentment. Crowley suggests thatthe real reason his mother was offended was because of the sexual connotationsof snakes. She no doubt had some Freudian dreams and as his mother was a “rathersensual type of woman,” her frustrations came out in warped ways. “Sexualrepression had driven her as nearly as possible to the borders of insanity,” hetells us.43 [index_split_019.html#filepos739958] Crowley’s growingpolymorphously perverse attitude to sex can, then, be seen as a safeguardagainst insanity.It may have been his mother’s reaction to Coleridge that led Crowley to poetry’sdoor, but it soon became of “paramount importance.” Oddly, Crowley avoidedShakespeare—England’s other “greatest poet”—precisely because he was allowed toread him, and came to him only by chance. Milton’s Paradise Lost bored him, butit at least allowed him to “gloat” over the figure of Satan and chortle abouthis sin. Longfellow and Tennyson, however, were, according to him, not evenpoets.Crowley was expected to become an evangelist, but he also had to adopt someprofession, and a medical career was suggested. This sparked an early poem aboutan ailing woman who was “rotting away.” “The lupus is over her face and head /Filthy and foul and horrid and dread / And her shrieks they would almost wakethe dead /Rotting away!”44 [index_split_019.html#filepos740112] The executionimproved but the theme—death, decay, “the worms gnawing the tissues foul”—wouldnot alter much. It is the kind of thing we might expect from a clever, talentedschoolboy, but Crowley produced verse like this for the rest of his life.Another early work took the side of Florence Maybrick, who was accused ofmurdering her husband in 1891 because of an adulterous affair she was having.She was sentenced to death but this was later commuted to life imprisonment. Theevidence against her was inconclusive and the case became a cause célèbre onboth sides of the Atlantic (Florence was American). Many believed Florence wasinnocent, yet Crowley’s inspiration for writing the poem had nothing to do witha miscarriage of justice but with Florence being an adulteress. “The mere fact”of this “thrilled” Crowley “to the marrow.” Adultery was the “summit ofwickedness” and that was enough for him.45 [index_split_019.html#filepos740238]After his expulsion from Eastbourne in the summer of 1895, Crowley took a tripon his own to the Bernese Oberland in Switzerland. Crowley had already visitedthe Alps the year before and he had joined the Scottish Mountaineering Club, butalthough he was certainly qualified, he was refused membership to theprestigious English Alpine Club. Crowley suggests the club was jealous of hisability, but most likely his self-assertive personality put them off; throughouthis life, Crowley had nothing but disdain for them. As with his natural talentfor science, Crowley seems to have been a born climber, and the solitude, quiet,and freedom seem to have brought out the best in him. There he discovered that“the problem of life was not how to satanize, as Huysmans would have calledit”—he refers to J. K. Huysmans’s decadent Satanic classic Là-bas—but “simply toescape from the oppressor and enjoy the world without any interference ofspiritual life of any sort.” Crowley found that his “happiest moments were whenI was alone on the mountains,” and that this happiness in no way derived frommysticism. “The beauty of form and colour, the physical exhilaration ofexercise, and the mental stimulation of finding one’s way in difficult countryformed the sole elements of my rapture.” At this point Crowley achieves aninsight into his psychology that one can only regret did not register morefirmly. “So far as I indulged in daydreams,” he tells us, “they were exclusivelyof a normal sexual type. There was no need to create phantasms of a perverse orunrealizable satisfaction”—the “forbiddenness” and “ultimate sin” he pursued.“It is important to emphasize this point,” he continues, “because I have alwaysappeared to my contemporaries as a very extraordinary individual obsessed byfantastic passions. But such were not in any way natural to me. The moment thepressure was relieved every touch of the abnormal was shed off instantly. Theimpulse to write poetry disappeared almost completely at such periods.”46[index_split_019.html#filepos740364]This is a remarkable passage. Not only does it tell us that poetry did not comenaturally to England’s other “greatest poet,” but that his incentive for writingit had little to do with his “real self” and practically everything to do withhis “self-image.” Crowley’s insight is tantamount to an admission that he wasnot really a poet. What real poet wouldn’t sing the beauty of the heights? Italso tells us that Crowley’s persona of the Beast 666 was a response to otherpeople. This was a problem he was saddled with throughout his life. Crowley wasalways conscious of other people and how they perceived him; hence the alteregos he adopted. He needed to “show off,” to get people to agree that he wassomething special—Ernest Becker’s “object of primary importance in theuniverse.” It was Crowley’s awareness of other people—“the pressure”—that drovehim to “satanize,” that is, to shock and scandalize. His poetry did not comefrom a natural spring within him but was wholly rooted in his desire to have aneffect. This is why he is not a great poet and only occasionally a good one. Thefact that Crowley didn’t feel the need to write poetry when in the mountainssuggests that for him poetry was welded to his personality. We need solitude toescape from our self, because solitude means being alone with your “real self,”not the one obliged to interact with others. Crowley escaped from his self whenhe was in the mountains, but when he came down to the lowlands, the “pressure”returned and he fell back into the habit of “satanizing.”In 1895 Crowley turned twenty. He entered Trinity College Cambridge, taking theMoral Science Tripos, believing that it would help him “to learn something aboutthe nature of things.”47 [index_split_019.html#filepos740490] After the firstlecture he never attended another. Crowley spent three years at Cambridge but atthe end came away without a degree. To do so, he said, was “unbefitting of andunnecessary to a gentleman.” That Crowley was perfectly qualified to earn adegree is undoubted, but his reasons for not doing so have more to do with hisinflated self-regard and natural laziness than anything else. It was not thework that stymied him. It was more an attitude of “I can’t be bothered.” Thisbecomes clear in a remark he made in his diary while recovering from hisexpulsion from Sicily. He is speaking of chess, but his comments are apt for hisentire life. “Once I am sure I have won,” he writes, “I lose interest. I feelthe other man ought to resign; I should like to hand the game over to asecretary to finish off for me. This is of course a fault in me, especially asit extends to other matters.”48 [index_split_019.html#filepos740617] It was atendency to “rest on my oars at the very moment when a spurt would take me pastthe post,” a feeling that “I needn’t bother about that anymore,” that had itsroots in his spoilt childhood.49 [index_split_019.html#filepos740879]Nevertheless, Crowley’s years at Cambridge were the happiest of his life. Forthe first time he was entirely on his own. No tutors, no Uncle Tom, no mother.He was triumphant. From now on Crowley could do what he wanted. He took rooms at16 St. John’s Street, overlooking St. John’s Chapel, and from that moment “anentirely new chapter” began in his life.—CROWLEY CAME into his inheritance in 1896 when he turned twenty-one. Exactly howmuch he inherited has been debated, but the figure usually mentioned is £40,000.A pound sterling in 1896 equaled roughly £90 ($150) in today’s currency; by ourstandards, Crowley would have been a millionaire. But even before he came intohis inheritance, Crowley had no money worries, and he blames his laterspendthrift ways on his upbringing. “I was taught to expect every possibleluxury. Nothing was too good for me and I had no idea what anything cost.” As ayouth he was kept short of pocket money, to prevent him from spending it onforbidden things like tobacco, books, or women. But if he wanted to give adinner party every day of the week, he could. At Cambridge he “still hadeverything paid for” and he found himself with “unlimited credit.”50[index_split_019.html#filepos741034]Crowley certainly used his unlimited credit. At Cambridge he dressed as atypical decadent in expensive suits, silk shirts, floppy bow ties—a stylishextravagance shared by his exceedingly sober contemporary Rudolf Steiner—andwith large rings adorning his delicate fingers, and he appointed his roomslavishly, buying many books—Carlyle, Swift, Coleridge, Fielding, Gibbon,Swinburne, Burton, everything forbidden at home. For better or worse, no oneapplied any brakes to Crowley’s expenditure. He “was never taught that effort onmy part might be required to obtain anything I wanted,” and so he “had no senseof responsibility in the matter of money.” With the result that when he did comeinto his fortune he was “utterly unprepared to use it with the most ordinaryprudence, and all the inherent vices of my training had a perfectly free fieldfor their development.”51 [index_split_019.html#filepos741165]Most writers on Crowley find the roots of his later philosophy in his reactionto his “repressive” Plymouth Brethren upbringing. Yet how repressive could hischildhood have been if he was taught “to expect every possible luxury”? To mymind this privilege was even more responsible for Crowley’s later profligacy.Crowley’s biggest problem was that everything came to him too easily. He neverhad to work for anything, and when he finally found himself penniless and leftto his own resources—during his difficult years in New York—he was in hisforties and the experience was shattering. In the Confessions Crowley wrote thathe had “never outgrown the infantile belief that the universe was made for me tosuck”; it was a full, maternal breast waiting for him to feed upon.52[index_split_019.html#filepos741286] This conveys a fundamentally passiveattitude toward life, as if he expected to open his mouth and food would simplyfly in.Crowley’s excesses at Cambridge, however, were not limited to fancy dress andluxurious furnishings. He also found an ample field for pursuing his favoritesin, sex. “My sexual life,” he tells us, “was very intense. My relations withwomen were entirely satisfactory.” They gave him the “maximum of bodilyenjoyment” and at the same time “symbolized my theological notions of sin.”“Love,” he declares, “was a challenge to Christianity” and every woman he metenabled him to defy the “tyranny of the Plymouth Brethren.”53[index_split_019.html#filepos741413] Crowley was now on his own and free fromthis tyranny: why did he still feel the need to “defy” anything? As otherindependent young minds were doing, couldn’t he jettison the religion of hispast and simply enjoy sex for the pleasurable experience it was, rather than assome diabolical act? “Free love” and other sexually “liberating” ideas had beentopics of heated debate for some time. Annie Besant, a leading Theosophist andone of Crowley’s later bêtes noires, had even been arrested for publishing abook on birth control (with Charles Bradlaugh in 1877), and Havelock Ellis,Edward Carpenter, H. G. Wells, George Bernard Shaw, and other writers wereopenly arguing for more modern, “liberated” attitudes toward sex. But takingthis progressive, reasonable approach would have meant weaning himself from thespice of sin, and by now Crowley was too hooked to give it up.Crowley’s appreciation of women was entirely of their ability to satisfy hissensual appetite and to inspire his poetry. That is, as sexual objects and asmuses, certainly not as human beings, an attitude that remained with himthroughout his life. “Morally and mentally,” he writes, “women were for mebeneath contempt. They had no moral ideals. They were bound up with theirnecessary preoccupation, with the function of reproduction . . . Intellectually,of course, they did not exist.”54 [index_split_019.html#filepos741540] Yet thisdid not deter him. “On the contrary, it was highly convenient that one’s sexualrelations should be with an animal with no consciousness beyond sex.”55[index_split_019.html#filepos741661] Crowley found forty-eight hours ofabstinence “sufficient to dull the fine edge of my mind” and complained of thetime he had to spend in hunting down “what ought to have been brought to theback door every evening with the milk!”56 [index_split_019.html#filepos741788]How this attitude affected the women in his life may be imagined, but Crowley’ssexual relations were not confined to the intellectually vacant sex for long. Anexperience in Stockholm on New Year’s Eve 1896 seems to have revealed to Crowleyhis predilection for sex with other men. It was then that he was “awakened tothe knowledge that I possessed a magical means of becoming conscious of andsatisfying a part of my nature which had to that moment concealed itself fromme.” The experience was one of “horror and pain” and “ghostly terror,” but italso provided the “purest and holiest spiritual experience that exists.”57[index_split_019.html#filepos741915] Crowley does not go into detail and hislanguage is purposefully obscure, but with Crowley, “magical” is often a codeword for “sexual.” When he writes of seducing the parlor maid on his mother’sbed, he speaks of making his “magical affirmation.” At this point in his life,however, Crowley had yet to begin his magical career, and so his use of“magical” in speaking of his Stockholm experience cannot be taken literally. Theconjunction of “horror,” “pain,” and “terror” with the “purest and holiestspiritual experience” is suggestive of the way Crowley wrote about hishomosexual magical “operas” later on. In later years Crowley took the passiverole in his XIo or homosexual magical workings, an expression of his appetitefor masochism and humiliation; one remembers his early thrills in fantasizingabout Nana Sahib and his “proud, fierce, cruel, sensual profile.” Most likelywhat happened on New Year’s Eve in Stockholm in 1896 was that Crowley allowedhimself to be sodomized and discovered that he enjoyed it.58[index_split_019.html#filepos742047]—HIS RETICENCE ABOUT this mysterious awakening also informed his first homosexualrelationship. In October 1897 Crowley met Herbert Charles Pollitt. He was fouryears older than Crowley—typically, in the Confessions Crowley says he was tenyears older—and had earned notoriety as a female impersonator. Pollitt performedfor the Cambridge Footlights Dramatic Club, posing as “Diane de Rougy,” apastiche of the Parisian dancer Liane de Pougy, a Folies Bergère entertainerfamous in her day. Crowley wrote of Pollitt’s hair: “he wore it ratherlong . . . its colour was pale gold, like spring sunshine, and its texture wasof the finest gossamer.” Yet Crowley says Pollitt had a tragic face thatemphasized the hunger of his eyes and the sadness of his mouth. Crowleydownplays the physical relationship between them, and speaks of the “firstintimate friendship” of his life, “the purest and noblest relation I had everhad with anybody.” There is no talk of making “magical affirmations” withPollitt. But one gets the impression that, however intimate, Pollitt was aseparate addition to Crowley’s life, and that he went on pursuing his otherinterests—poetry, mountaineering—“as if I had never met him.” Eventually hebroke from Pollitt. Pollitt was close friends with the artist Aubrey Beardsley,who, with Oscar Wilde, was a leading figure of the “decadent movement.” Likemany of that generation, Pollitt “represented eternal dissatisfaction” and had adesperate outlook on life.59 [index_split_019.html#filepos742264] Crowley,however, was “determined to make my dreams come true.”Crowley is disingenuous when he says that he resisted the influence of thedecadent school that Pollitt introduced him to. He was obsessed with many of thesame themes as the decadents were. His first published poem, Aceldama: A Placeto Bury Strangers In, was privately printed in 1898 by Leonard Smithers—a friendof Pollitt’s and publisher of Wilde—in an edition of one hundred sumptuouslyproduced copies, paid for by Crowley himself. This vanity production is suffusedwith much of the sentiment that Crowley tells us he rejected. The title comesfrom the field where Judas hanged himself after betraying Christ and,predictably, the setting is a brothel. It fits, as one critic has remarked, thefin de siècle mode of “dark, tragic, blood-smeared musings.”60[index_split_019.html#filepos742424]Aceldama seems to express the sense of pointlessness common to the time, aspiritual nausea at a meaningless cosmos. Crowley writes, “I crept, a stealthyhungry soul, to grasp / Its vast edge, to look to the beyond.” But when the poetdoes look beyond the edge of the cosmos, all he sees is “Nothing, Nothing,Nothing!” There is also a sense in which Crowley seems to conflate spiritualexperience with homosexuality, a union he may have encountered in Stockholm.Sprouting wings the poet climbs to the infinite, where “all power, light, life,motion concentrate.” And there he finds “God dwelling / Strong immaculate / Heknew me and he loved! / His lips anoint / My lips with love . . .”61[index_split_019.html#filepos742638] Sex and the spirit, sensuality andasceticism vie for the poet’s faith. Blasphemy, degradation, masochism abound.Crowley believed that with the poem he had “attained, at a bound, the summit ofParnassus,” but it is clear he had landed in its well-trodden foothills. Crowleyhimself must have recognized this. In 1910 Crowley issued a selection of hispoetry in “response to a widely spread lack of interest in my writings.” Morethan a decade had passed and the hunger for recognition was still unsatisfied,but nothing from Aceldama, which he believed placed him among the poetic gods,was included in his Ambergris (1910).Typically, his nom de plume for his maiden work was “A Gentleman of theUniversity of Cambridge,” nicking the pseudonym from Percy Bysshe Shelley’sfamous The Necessity of Atheism (1811), which was authored by “a Gentleman ofthe University of Oxford.” Aceldama was not well received—it garnered one reviewthat suggested it should not be read by the young—but one enthusiastic readerplayed an important part in Crowley’s life. Gerald Kelly, who later became SirGerald Kelly and a president of the Royal Academy, was intrigued by this strangegentleman of the university and visited him in his rooms. The two became friendsand continued to meet in London after they left university. Yet even with allhis affinities to the “steamy, sex-soaked vapours” of the decadents, Crowley didhave a fundamental toughness and, odd to say, health, that made him turn hisback on them and Pollitt.62 [index_split_019.html#filepos742883] Pollitt in anycase had no interest in Crowley’s poetry or his spiritual aspirations and it’sno mystery Crowley moved on.Some biographers have criticized Crowley for not coming out of the closet andaffirming his homosexuality, which at the time was illegal, but hiscircumspection may have sources other than prudent self-regard. A relatedquestion is Crowley’s attitude toward Oscar Wilde. One would think Wilde wouldhave been a hero of his. But precisely this may be the key. Crowley’s highopinion of himself could not accept his being regarded as merely a Wilde clone,and it has to be said that much of Crowley’s poetry and his lust for theforbidden and antagonism toward Christian morality is very reminiscent of Wilde.Wilde’s trial for “gross indecency”—homosexuality—took place in 1895, the yearCrowley went to Cambridge, and Crowley’s remarks about Wilde in the Confessionsare mostly negative. Crowley suggests that Wilde became homosexual because hewas a snob and it was a way to meet the “right people”; it was, Crowley infers,a “career move.” Ironically, his remark that Wilde had “adopted the standards ofthe English middle class, and thought to become distinguished by the simpleprocess of outraging them” can very easily be laid at Crowley’s own door, as canhis belief that Wilde “was not true to himself.”63[index_split_019.html#filepos743057] His remarks about Wilde’s writing alsosuggest a petulant envy. Crowley may have wanted to distance himself from Wildeout of a certain prudence but also because he realized that much of his owncreative efforts were a kind of Wilde warmed up. In his essay “The Soul of ManUnder Socialism” (1891), Wilde writes of the “true personality of man” in a waythat presages Crowley’s ideas about the “true will” remarkably.64[index_split_019.html#filepos743217]—ASIDE FROM COMMITTING the unforgivable sin—and any others he could along theway—at twenty-one Crowley was still unsure of what to do with his life. For atime he thought of entering the diplomatic service. Imperial Russia attractedhim and during his vacation of 1897 he visited St. Petersburg. But althoughcourtly intrigue was fascinating—and he later enjoyed playacting as a spy—thediplomatic life didn’t appeal. He had also considered making a career of chess,and on the return trip from Russia he stopped in Berlin and attended a chessconference. He was not impressed. He was struck with the revelation—he calls ita mystical experience—that he was not put on this planet to be a chess master.Like the hero of Robert Musil’s The Man Without Qualities, Crowley found himselfan intelligent, strong-willed, and capable individual, with no idea what to dowith his talents. A profound depression came over him. All human effort seemedpointless; the deep truth of Vanitas vanitatum omnia vanitas (“Vanity ofvanities, all is vanity”) became painfully clear; it was this nihilism thatinformed Aceldama. A diplomat, a chess master, even a great poet: all would beforgotten within a century or two. Even a Shakespeare or a Napoleon would amountto nothing when the Earth and the entire cosmos were eventually destroyed. Whatwas the point? Crowley embraced the Buddha’s grim truth, that “everything issorrow.” This spiritual nihilism stayed with him the rest of his life—“nothingmatters” is frequently the punch line to Crowley’s musings—but something in himresisted this feeling of inconsequence. “I must find a material in which to workwhich is resistant to the forces of change,” he told himself.65[index_split_019.html#filepos744265]We may feel that this is an expression of Crowley’s need to be an “object ofprimary importance in the universe,” but there is more to his insight than that.Crowley grasped the Platonic truth that while the material world is destined fordecay, the world of the mind, of the spirit, can transcend this corruption andachieve a kind of immortality. “Spiritual facts,” Crowley saw, “were the onlythings worthwhile.” We must chalk up this insight to the part of Crowley thatwas great, and it is this sort of intuition that prevents us from relegating himto the status of a mere crank. Crowley was onto something real. Suddenly themeaning and purpose of his life became clear. “I had never given myself whollyto chess, mountaineering or even to poetry,” he thought, but now Crowley had aplan. He had perceived the “worthlessness of the world.” He now devoted himselfto what he called the “escape from matter” and a “definite invasion of thespiritual world.”But no sooner had he embraced this insight than Crowley subjected it to hispeculiar logic. His scientific mind required “first-hand sensory evidence ofspiritual beings,” not recognizing the oxymoronic character of this demand, asby definition “spiritual beings” are not “sensory.” But Crowley went further.The spiritual world for him meant angels on one side and devils on the other.Crowley had sided with Satan, so it was only natural that his first step in hisnew life was to “get into personal communication with the devil.”66[index_split_019.html#filepos744420]To side with the devil for the sake of the spiritual seems odd. But Crowley’sspirituality is of the antinomian school; it embraces the idea that thespiritually awakened person is no longer subject to laws, is, indeed, “beyondgood and evil.” This confusion between heaven and hell, good and evil, thespiritual and the satanic was at the heart of Aceldama. “It was a windy night,that memorable seventh night of December, when this philosophy was born in me.How the grave old professor wondered at my ravings!” Crowley writes. “I was inthe death struggle with self: God and Satan fought for my soul those three longhours. God conquered—now I have only one doubt left—which of the twain was God?”Yet on a more immediate level, Crowley the literalist wanted something to do. Hewas not content with mere poetry, with echoing the kind of satanic verses otherdecadents had already voiced. Crowley’s decision to get a “manual of practicaltechnical instruction” and devote himself to “black magic” was surely rooted inhis taste for the “impossible.”67 [index_split_019.html#filepos744547] In thatcentury of progress, reason, and rationality, surely no one believed that it waspossible to evoke devils. No? Well, Crowley the impossibilist would prove themwrong.He found what he was looking for in Arthur Edward Waite’s ponderous classic, TheBook of Black Magic and Pacts. Typically, Crowley later had nothing good to sayabout Waite, and vilified him every chance he got; he is among the Golden Dawncrew Crowley eviscerates in Moonchild. According to Crowley, Waite is “not onlythe most ponderously platitudinous and priggishly prosaic of pretentiouslypompous pork butchers of the language, but the most voluminously voluble.”68[index_split_019.html#filepos744668] This not only tells us that Crowley isunforgiving, even to the man who put him on the road to adeptship, but it alsohighlights one of the worst faults in Crowley’s own “pork butchery” of thelanguage, his taste for alliteration. It is impossible to read much of Crowleywithout coming across this habit of his, which to him must have seemed poeticbut to most readers is simply indulgent. Waite is a poor stylist, but Crowleyoften is, too, his claims to being a “master” of the English languagenotwithstanding. Yet worse than this is the fact that decades after he readWaite’s book, Crowley still can’t forgive Waite for actually helping him in hiscareer.Waite’s book hinted at the existence of a Hidden Church, where the rites of trueinitiation were maintained. When Crowley wrote to Waite, the pork butcherreplied by suggesting Crowley read The Cloud Upon the Sanctuary, aneighteenth-century classic of Christian mysticism by Karl von Eckartshausen, afriend of the great French mystic Louis Claude de Saint-Martin, who wrote as“the unknown philosopher.”69 [index_split_019.html#filepos744795] Crowley readthe book during the Easter vacation of 1898, which he spent with Pollitt inWastdale Head, a rock-climbing area in the Lake District. Eckartshausen spoke ofa secret, hidden church, a congregation of the elect, an inner circle of adeptsdevoted to the noble cause of truth. Crowley’s new passion for the spiritualworld and his aristocratic sense were hooked. Nothing else mattered now exceptto find that church and enter its ranks.His opportunity came while he was in the mountains. In the summer of 1898—he hadalready left Cambridge—Crowley was with Eckenstein in the Alps. The weather wasbad and climbing was impossible, even for Crowley. He had brought along a bookthat he found incomprehensible but which fascinated him for that very reason. Itwas a translation of a work by the seventeenth-century Silesian cabalist Knorrvon Rosenroth, the Kabbala Denudata, or The Kabbalah Unveiled, by S. L.MacGregor Mathers. The translator of this strange work of Jewish-Christianmysticism proved to be one of the most important people in Crowley’s life.Crowley says his health was bad that summer and so, with climbing out of thequestion, he left camp for Zermatt. Here he held court in a beer hall,pontificating on the mysteries of alchemy, about which he knew practicallynothing. But someone there that night did. An Englishman and chemist, JulianBaker, spoke to him afterward, and explained that he was, in fact, a practicingalchemist. Baker explained that he had prepared “fixed mercury,” a considerableachievement in the ancient art. Crowley felt fate had arrived. Ever sincereading The Cloud Upon the Sanctuary, Crowley was determined to gain entry intoits Hidden Church. That Easter he had sent out a mystical SOS, asking for aMaster to come and take him by the hand. It seemed his call had been answered.When he parted from Baker that evening, he resolved to speak with him the nextmorning about his spiritual search.But the next morning he discovered that Baker had left the hotel. No one knewwhere he was. Crowley would not let this opportunity slip away. He telegraphedall over the valley. Baker had been seen at some locations, but when Crowleyarrived, he was gone. Yet the impossibilist was not deterred. Crowley discoveredthat an Englishman fitting Baker’s description was heading down the valleytoward Brique. Crowley followed and caught up with Baker some ten miles belowZermatt. He told the chemist of his search for the Hidden Church and the secretsaints. He must have been convincing. Baker told him of a group in London whomight be of interest to him. He also said that he knew someone who was much moreof a magician than he was, and that he would introduce Crowley to him when theymet again in London. Crowley’s SOS had been heard. The shadows of a golden dawnwere drawing in. If a new life had started for Crowley when he enteredCambridge, it was destiny itself that beckoned now."},{"pageContent":"TWOTWILIGHT OF THE GOLDEN DAWN> [images/00004.jpg] The year 1898 was an important one for Crowley. Along with Aceldama, Crowleywrote and self-published several other works that year, all in sumptuouseditions: The Tale of Archais, The Poem, Jezebel, Songs of the Spirit, Jephthah,and White Stains. Jephthah, a verse play, is interesting in the context ofCrowley’s inability to edit himself or accept editing from someone else, or evento absorb helpful criticism, a dangerous resistance in a writer. As his friendLouis Wilkinson remarked, Crowley was “too sure of his genius to criticize orrevise adequately his own work.”1 [index_split_019.html#filepos745129] Soonafter his initiation into the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn—the group thatBaker introduced him to—Crowley showed the printer’s proofs of Jephthah to hisnew magical brother, William Butler Yeats, a leading member of the order. By1898 Yeats was a recognized author, having already published several importantpoems. For all his bluster about being England’s “other greatest poet,” Crowley,ten years Yeats’s junior, was hungry for approval. Yeats had already been in theGolden Dawn for almost a decade when Crowley arrived; he had also been aTheosophist, and had met Madame Blavatsky.2 [index_split_019.html#filepos745282]Yeats was a dreamy, romantic personality, sensitive and distant, and Crowley’sself-assertive character no doubt grated on him. Yeats was too polite to saywhat he felt about the poem—readers can judge it for themselves—and offered somefaint encouragement.3 [index_split_019.html#filepos745520] Crowley could nottake this lightly—Yeats, of course, should have burst out in praise and robustlyclasped the hand of his fellow poet—and decades later in the Confessions Crowleyoffered the reason for Yeats’s lack of appreciation. It was clear that, afterreading a few lines of Jephthah, “black, bilious rage” shook Yeats to his soulbecause Yeats recognized that Crowley was a much greater poet than he would everbe. In later years Yeats fine-tuned his assessment and admitted that amid muchrhetoric, Crowley had written at least six lines of real poetry.Crowley maintained a venomous animosity toward Yeats for the rest of his lifeand lost no opportunity to vent it. In Moonchild, Yeats is portrayed as theblack magician Gates, whose corpse is used in a hideous ritual, and in Crowley’sstory “At the Fork of the Roads,” Yeats is again portrayed as a black magician.No doubt that early snub hurt. One wonders how Crowley felt about Yeats in 1923.That year Crowley was expelled from Sicily by Mussolini, had his name plasteredover the tabloids, and was trying to kick heroin. Yeats, his poetic rival, wonthe Nobel Prize for literature.White Stains deserves mention because it is an early example of somethingCrowley enjoyed throughout his life: pornography. This particular collection,which Crowley claimed to be the work of George Archibald Bishop, “a neuropath ofthe Second Empire”—Bishop, of course, was Uncle Tom’s surname, and Archibald thename of Crowley’s one decent tutor—has been called the “filthiest in the Englishlanguage.”4 [index_split_019.html#filepos745695] The fact that Crowley’sliterary alter ego dies in an asylum after exploring the depths of depravity ledCrowley to argue that the book would be a helpful guide for Sunday schoolstudents, and would keep them on the straight and narrow: an example ofCrowley’s often forced humor.Connoisseurs of crude erotica and transgression may find some delight in WhiteStains, and one assumes that the stains in question are of semen. There arepoems on bestiality, necrophilia, and even coprophagia, or “scat,” the eating ofexcrement, and urophagia, the drinking of urine. In “Go Into the Highways andHedges, and Compel Them to Come In”—taken from Luke 14:23—Crowley writes:> Let my fond lips but drink thy golden wine,> My bright-eyed Arab, only let me eat> The rich brown globes of sacramental meat> Steaming and firm, hot from their home divine . . . The poem goes on to extol the virtues of licking dirty feet, and Crowley himselfwould practice coprophagia as part of his attainment of godhood when he finallyachieved the magical rank of Ipsissimus in Sicily. Another poem bemoans theinconvenience of “caught clap” (gonorrhea), another sings the virtue of “passivepaederasty,” in which “a strong man’s love is my delight”—inspired by his“magical” experience in Stockholm—and another suggests sex with the crucifiedChrist, an idea that Crowley may have picked up from the sexual mysticism of theeighteenth-century German Count Zinzendorf.5[index_split_019.html#filepos745848] What White Stains certainly communicates isthat Crowley in no way rejected the obsession with depravity that characterizedthe decadent school that his lover Pollitt had introduced him to; like Aceldamait was published by Pollitt’s friend Leonard Smithers, who specialized indecadent literature.Crowley’s explanation for why he wrote the book is that he had been readingRichard von Krafft-Ebing’s Psychopathia Sexualis and wanted to prove that sexualperversions were not the result of disease, as Krafft-Ebing believed, but are“magical affirmations of perfectly intelligible points of view.”6[index_split_019.html#filepos746050] But most readers, I think, will find itdifficult to accept eating excrement as an expression of a “perfectlyintelligible point of view,” or even as a no doubt peculiar but understandableerotic practice. In 1924 most of the original printing of White Stains wasseized by His Majesty’s customs officials and destroyed.7[index_split_019.html#filepos746170]That Crowley published his first work of pornography in the same year he wasinitiated into the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn is instructive. Just asAceldama expresses a confusion about God and Satan, Crowley’s parallel pursuitof his Holy Guardian Angel and the “unforgivable sin” suggests a similar mix-up.At this point Crowley was pulled by contradictory desires, to become a member ofa secret order of saints and a devil worshipper.8[index_split_019.html#filepos746330] This spiritual confusion begins what wemight call Crowley’s practice of “holy sinning,” or his belief in “the sanctityof the foul,” which reaches its apogee during Crowley’s own coprophagia inCefalù. Some form of “holy sinning” has been a part of the Western spiritualtradition since the Gnostics, who saw the God of the Bible as an evil demiurge,and the world he created as false. One way to loosen the chains of falsehood isthrough acts of reversal, something we know Crowley did at the age of eleven,when he decided to switch sides in the great battle between Jesus and Satan.This antinomian sentiment has appeared in many forms. In Northern Europe in thethirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the Brethren of the Free Spirit believedthat God was in everything, and that through a direct experience of God—in theform of the Holy Spirit—we become one with Him and therefore incapable of sin,and so can act as we please. On the face of it this sounds desirable. Yet otherforms of “holy sinning” seem less harmless. In 1969 Charles Manson’s “Family,”who also wanted to go beyond good and evil, committed several gruesome murders,which they claimed they did “out of love.” (Nietzsche himself wrote “that whichis done out of love always occurs beyond good and evil.”)We have no hesitation in rejecting Manson’s form of “holy sinning,” but whatabout Christ, who preferred the company of prostitutes and other riffraff to theself-proclaimed righteous? The problem with “holy sinning” is that it isdifficult to tell when you are going beyond good and evil as a saint (Christ) ora sinner (Manson, who often referred to himself as a modern-day Christ). If, asthe antinomian view has it, “anything goes”—meaning the norms no longerapply—then very questionable practices can be excused as expressions of a moreintense spirituality that the lukewarm adherents to the straight and narrow aretoo cowardly to pursue. For the rest of his life, Crowley would espouse aphilosophy expressing this antinomian rejection of opposites.That way to godhead began when Crowley arrived in London and looked up thealchemist Julian Baker. Baker soon introduced Crowley to the Welshman GeorgeCecil Jones. Jones, like Baker, was a chemist, and like Baker, a member of theHermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Jones was five years older than Crowley. Hewas also the son of a suicide and looked remarkably like Christ—or at least likeVictorian representations of Christ. Unlike the Victorian Christ, he was anunstable character and possessed a fiery temper. Jones remained a close friendand associate of Crowley’s for more than a decade, and Crowley’s firstinstructions in magic came from Jones. Jones quickly discovered that Crowley hada natural talent for magic, and that he was ready to devote his life to it. Theimpossibilist was on the scent, and Jones suggested Crowley join his magicalorder.Like the death of his father and his escape from the Plymouth Brethren,Crowley’s initiation into the Golden Dawn was one of the most significant eventsin his life. “Beyond all other mundane events,” Israel Regardie tells us, “itwas the influence of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn that shaped AleisterCrowley’s life.”9 [index_split_019.html#filepos746527] Yet Crowley himself wasnot that impressed with this tremendous turning point. After imagining thehorrors his initiation at Mark Mason’s Hall on Great Queen Street on November18, 1898, would entail—he asked Julian Baker if anyone had died during theritual—Crowley was disappointed to discover that the ritual was a mere formalityenacted by “muddled middle-class mediocrities.”10[index_split_019.html#filepos746680] After an elaborate ceremony, at the end ofwhich Crowley was told that, after dwelling long in darkness, he must now “Quitthe night and seek the day,” Crowley took the magical name Perdurabo (“I willendure to the end”). Perhaps this enabled him to endure meeting the “abjectassemblage of nonentities” that his ten-shilling membership fee entitled him tojoin. There was the despicable Yeats (Daemon est Deus Inversus—“The Devil Is GodInverted”). There was also the writer Arthur Machen (Filus Aquarti), who was nononentity, having made a name for himself a few years earlier with his decadentnovella The Great God Pan, considered one of the classic horror tales of the“gaslight” age. William Westcott (Non Omnis Moriar), one of the founders of theorder, had been a member of the Inner Order of Madame Blavatsky’s exclusiveEsoteric Order. Florence Farr (Sapientia Sapienti Dono Data) was a famous WestEnd actress and women’s rights activist. The pork butcher of English A. E. Waite(Sacramentum Regis Abscondere Bonun Est), another member, was by then the authorof several works on magic. The philanthropist and tea-heiress Annie Horniman(Fortiter et Recte) was another member. There were others, too; a full list canbe found in one of the many accounts of the order’s history. Crowley’s slur thatnone of the members he met that day “made any mark in the world” is simplyuntrue and is another example of Crowley’s self-serving rewriting of history.We can also recognize Crowley’s naivety. During his Cambridge days, Crowley hadalready joined two other groups before he found the Golden Dawn. The CelticChurch, whose pillars were “Chivalry and Mystery,” attracted him for a time andmade him fantasize about the Holy Grail, while the Spanish Legitimistmovement—which aimed to put the pretender Don Carlos on the Spanish throne—madehim think of himself as a man of action; he even learned how to use a machinegun in preparation for an invasion of Spain. Both of these possibilities peteredout and Crowley was still hankering for some romantic future. After readingEckartshausen’s The Cloud Upon the Sanctuary, Crowley expected to find himselfin a mystery-enshrouded hidden temple, far removed from the daily round, not inan ordinary Masonic lodge next door to Covent Garden. Crowley wanted thespiritual equivalent of his “unforgivable sin,” not a rented hall occupied byordinary people who, like himself, had an interest in magic. With romanticexpectations like these, practically anything that could have happened that daywould have been a letdown.Years later, when writing his Confessions, Crowley recognized that his snobberywas inappropriate. But at the time he felt he already knew more about magic thanthe cabal of mediocrities he was introduced to, and no doubt his natural senseof superiority was evident to them, too. In the end he felt some respect foronly two members: the head of the order, S. L. MacGregor Mathers, the eccentrictranslator of The Kabbalah Unveiled, which Crowley read in the Alps beforemeeting Julian Baker; and Allan Bennett, who, along with Oscar Eckenstein, wasone of the few people Crowley never had a bad word for. (Oddly enough, as IsraelRegardie points out, all three—Crowley, Eckenstein, and Bennett—were asthmatic.)—THE HERMETIC ORDER of the Golden Dawn was the most famous magical society of themodern age. Although most likely apocryphal, the most well-known account of itsorigins concerns a cipher manuscript discovered in a secondhand bookstall inLondon’s Farringdon Road.11 [index_split_019.html#filepos746844] The ReverendAlphonsus Woodford, who wrote about Freemasonry, is said to have found themanuscript; he could make nothing of it, and so gave it to his friend and fellowmason William Westcott, who was a member of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia,or the Rosicrucian Society in England. Westcott called in Mathers, anotherMason, to help. They cracked the cipher—invented by the fifteenth-century Germanmonk and occultist Johannes Trithemius—and saw that it contained magicalrituals. It also contained a letter from a Fraulein Anna Sprengel in Nuremberg,with her address, saying that if more information about the cipher was needed,it could be had from her. Westcott corresponded with Fraulein Sprengel and askedabout the rituals. She claimed to be the head of a magical order, Die GoldenDämmerung, “The Golden Dawn,” and she gave Westcott a charter to start a branchof the society in England. In the autumn of 1887, Westcott, Mathers, and Dr.William Woodman inaugurated the Isis-Urania Temple of the Hermetic Order of theGolden Dawn; the Isis a nod, perhaps, to Westcott’s previous esoteric teacher,Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, whose first major work was the hugely influentialIsis Unveiled. The actual charter from Fraulein Sprengel did not arrive untilMarch 1888. It was unsigned, so Westcott signed it himself. Mathers was giventhe task of completing the fragments of ritual that the cipher contained. Thesewere of an initiatory character. The cipher also contained material on thetrumps of the tarot deck and some other magical materials.Fraulein Sprengel, the story goes, died in 1891, and Westcott’s last letter toher was answered by her magical associates. They took a dim view of heractivities and, in short, said her English correspondents could expect no morehelp from them. They had already been given enough information to carry onthemselves, and if they needed more, they would have to contact the SecretChiefs on their own. These mysterious Secret Chiefs were the true heads of theirorder.The Secret Chiefs occupy the same position in the Western magical tradition thatthe Hidden Masters or Mahatmas do in Madame Blavatsky’s Theosophy. They arebeings of a higher spiritual nature with miraculous powers—supermen—whoclandestinely watch over humanity and guide it in its evolution. Blavatskyalways insisted that her Masters were actual men who had developed their dormantpowers, not beings from another dimension, as Crowley and others would claim.12[index_split_019.html#filepos747750] But whoever the Secret Chiefs were, at thispoint, the only person they were speaking to was the head of the order, SamuelLiddell MacGregor Mathers. By 1898 Woodman had died and Westcott had been forcedto leave the order. Some papers Westcott left in a hansom cab that spoke of hismagical pursuits came to the attention of his superiors at the London Coroner’soffice, and they explained that if he wished to keep his job, he would have togive up magic. This left Mathers in sole command. Like George Cecil Jones,Mathers (Deo Duce Comite Ferro—“God My Guide, My Companion a Sword”) had a fierytemperament and his dictatorial leadership style and later favoring of Crowleyeventually led to a schism in the order. He claimed that in 1892 he had madedirect contact with the Secret Chiefs and that this conferred on him soleauthority. His account of the experience is worth noting. Mathers wrote that “Ican only compare it to the continued effect of that usually experiencedmomentarily by any person close to whom a flash of lightning passes during aviolent storm; coupled with a difficulty in respiration similar to thehalf-strangling effect produced by ether.”13[index_split_019.html#filepos749700]Mathers had been the curator of the prestigious Horniman Museum in South London,but an argument with Frederick J. Horniman, his boss, led to his dismissal.Annie Horniman, Frederick’s daughter and a Golden Dawn initiate, gave Mathers apension of £443 a year and with this he went to Paris, where he haunted theBibliothèque de l’Arsenal. Mathers claimed that while walking through the Boisde Boulogne, a large park on the western edge of the city, he met three SecretChiefs who told him that he was their representative and sole channel ofauthority for the Golden Dawn. This claim, coupled with the fact that Matherswas leading the order from a different city, led to great dissatisfaction withhis leadership. Crowley’s appearance acted as a catalyst and in little more thana year the order fractured.Like Crowley, Mathers was an eccentric character, mixing an obsession with magicwith another passion, military history. Like Crowley, he was a vivid fantasist.Mathers joined a volunteer infantry group and was photographed in a lieutenant’suniform. Mathers didn’t have that rank but the photograph was a means ofsupporting his self-image as an officer. Mathers adopted MacGregor as a name inthe middle of the Celtic craze that led Crowley to join the Celtic Church.Mathers was photographed in Highland regalia, but he had no Scottish blood. Hewas born in London’s East End in 1854, the son of a clerk; he never set foot inScotland until 1897, and then only to inspect a Golden Dawn branch in Edinburgh.He also called himself the “Count of Glenstrae,” showing a taste for unwarrantedtitles that Crowley would soon also display.In 1887 Mathers met Moina Bergson, sister of the philosopher Henri Bergson, inthe British Museum, and they soon married. Moina was an art student at the SladeSchool; she was also psychic and Mathers often used her powers when he needed tocontact the Secret Chiefs. Crowley, too, employed female seers when he needed tocontact the higher planes. As with Mathers, it was Crowley’s wife who provided adirect line to the Secret Chiefs. Yeats, who met Mathers in the early 1890s,called him a “figure of romance.” Once, Yeats met Mathers when he was wearingHighland dress and had knives stuck into his stockings. He told the poet, “WhenI’m dressed like this I feel like a walking flame.”14[index_split_019.html#filepos749864] Much of the Golden Dawn magic, as well asCrowley’s, has to do with what is called the “assumption of the god form,” whenthe magician imagines he has become the particular god he wants to invoke byvisualizing his form enveloping his own. Mathers’s habit of photographinghimself in fancy dress can be seen as a less magical version of this, asCrowley’s early playacting can be seen as a preparation for it.It would be easy to dismiss Mathers as a deluded fantasist, but like Crowley,Mathers had some natural talent for magic. Yeats recounts how Mathers handed himcards with Hindu tattwa symbols on them, representing the five elements—fire,water, air, earth, and spirit—used in Golden Dawn training, and told him topress them against his forehead. When Yeats did, images came to himinvoluntarily, each one appropriate for each symbol. The fire symbol, a redtriangle, raised a vision of a black giant rising up out of ruins in a desert.Mathers told him it was a being of the order of salamanders, whose element isfire. Yeats later wondered if telepathy might account for this, but ruled thisout when he discovered that if he gave someone the wrong card—say water, asilver crescent, instead of air, a blue circle—they nevertheless received thecorrect vision for that card. The symbols themselves seem to possess some power,and in his essay “The Trembling of the Veil,” Yeats wrote that it was throughMathers that he was convinced that “images well up before the mind’s eyes from adeeper source than conscious or subconscious memory,” a remarkable anticipationof Jung’s notion of the “collective unconscious.” At a session with Mathers andMoina, Yeats discovered that he would visualize what Moina would describe evenbefore she began to describe it. Somehow they had entered a kind of group orshared mind or, more magically, a section of the astral plane.—CROWLEY, TOO, felt like a walking flame at times, or at least wanted to. As inthe case of Eckenstein, he saw in Mathers another father figure. There werestrong similarities between them. Aside from being fantasists, they both hadathletic physiques. Yeats tells the story of how a boxing partner of Mathers’swas surprised that he could knock him down, even though Mathers was the largerman; he later discovered that Mathers, perpetually in poverty, was starving atthe time. Both were unwilling or unable to brook any criticism. Both soughtpower and control. Both had paranoid suspicions about the people around them andoften bit the hand that fed—indeed, they often made a banquet of it. In Paris,around the time of Crowley’s initiation, Mathers had begun performing publicrituals of Egyptian Masses celebrating Isis that he had discovered in hisresearches. Moina acted as the high priestess and the performances were asuccess, at least according to the L’Écho du merveilleux, which reviewed them.In 1910, Crowley, we shall see, did the same in London.The Golden Dawn membership was arranged hierarchically, with ten levels in all,grouped in three sections. This arrangement paralleled that of the KabbalisticTree of Life. Although it was called a hermetic order, and included manyEgyptian and Rosicrucian motifs, much of the Golden Dawn’s teaching related toKabbalah, the ancient Jewish mystical tradition. Crowley’s own metaphysicalsystem is Egyptian through and through, but Crowley’s own thinking was wellsuited to the meticulous classifications peculiar to Kabbalah. This can be seenin his early Kabbalistic work 777, a kind of Linnean filing system of magic,mapping out the correspondences between numbers, the Hebrew alphabet, the Treeof Life, gods, colors, perfumes, stones, planets, astrological signs, demons,and much else. In Kabbalah, existence is arranged in a descending scale, fromthe purest spiritual manifestation to the rock-solid earth. This scale isdepicted as a kind of metaphysical tree, and its branches contain “vessels,” orsephiroth, designed to hold the spiritual energies at work in creation. Startingout from a nonmanifest source, the Ain Soph Aur, or “limitless light,” anindescribable dimension, the divine energies burst into being. From highest tolowest we have Kether (Crown), Chokmah (Wisdom), Binah (Understanding), Chesed(Mercy), Geburah (Strength), Tiphareth (Beauty), Netzach (Victory), Hod(Splendour), Yesod (Foundation), and Malkuth (Kingdom).With the Golden Dawn system, one begins as a Neophyte 00 = 0empty square[images/00005.jpg], which is not yet on the magical ladder, then moves toZealator 10 = 10empty square [images/00005.jpg]. Next comes Theoricus 20 =9empty square [images/00005.jpg], Practicus 30 = 8empty square[images/00005.jpg], and Philosophus 40 = 7empty square [images/00005.jpg], whichform the grades of the first, or Outer, Order, to which technically the nameGolden Dawn applies. The Second Order, that of the Ruby Rose and Gold Cross, amore Rosicrucian-influenced level, includes the degrees of Adeptus Minor 50 =6empty square [images/00005.jpg], Adeptus Major 60 = 5empty square[images/00005.jpg], and Adeptus Exemptus 70 = 4empty square [images/00005.jpg].In the first order, initiates performed ceremonies and rituals and studied thephilosophy of magic, but it was only in the Second Order that actual magic waspracticed. No Second Order could exist without direct contact with the SecretChiefs, which is why Mather’s alleged link with them was so important. The nextthree grades, Magister Templi (Master of the Temple) 80 = 3empty square[images/00005.jpg], Magus 90 = 2empty square [images/00005.jpg], and Ipsissimus(roughly, one’s “most selfness”) 100 = 1empty square [images/00005.jpg] areseparated from the others by what Crowley calls “the Abyss.” These three gradescorrespond to Binah, Chokmah, and Kether on the Tree of Life, which are known asthe “Supernals.” Although not as far removed as the Ain Soph Aur itself, theirexistence is nevertheless quite beyond any ordinary human conception and canonly be understood by crossing the Abyss. The Abyss is a chasm in existence inwhich our binary, dualistic conceptions dissolve and we either pass through itand enter that mystical realm beyond good and evil where “all is one” that theantinomian aspirant seeks, or plummet into madness. It was in this Third Orderthat the Secret Chiefs resided. No one in the Golden Dawn had reached thislevel; Mathers himself got only as far as an Adeptus Exemptus 70 = 4empty square[images/00005.jpg]. This, of course, did not deter Crowley.Most Golden Dawn initiates hoped to attain the Knowledge and Conversation oftheir Holy Guardian Angel, a mystical meeting with their Higher Self associatedwith the sephiroth Tiphareth and the grade Adeptus Minor 50 = 6empty square[images/00005.jpg]. This was reached through performing the difficult SacredMagic of Abramelin the Mage, a medieval ritual Mathers had come upon in theBibliothèque de l’Arsenal and which he had translated into English. This workwould have a profound influence on Crowley, and more than one biographer hassuggested that his downfall began with his attempt to perform it. But even hisHoly Guardian Angel was only a milestone on Crowley’s magical ascent. Everythingwe know about him tells us he was heading for the Abyss.Crowley rose through the ranks very quickly. Most of what he was required tolearn as a Neophyte he already knew. The next hurdles, of Zealator, Theoricus,and Practicus, were no trouble, and by May 1899 he had reached the rank ofPhilosophus. The next grade, Adeptus Minor 50 = 6empty square[images/00005.jpg], required a probationary period, and so Crowley had to coolhis magical heels for a spell. By this time he had met the only member of theGolden Dawn for whom he retained any respect. After one ceremony he became awareof a powerful magical force, which seemed to emanate from a member he had yet tomeet. Frater Iehi Aour (“Let There Be Light”), otherwise known as Allan Bennett,had a reputation as a magician second only to Mathers. He approached Crowley andto Crowley’s surprise said, “Little Brother, you have been meddling with theGoetia!” Bennett must have had a keen intuition. Goetia means “howling” but itis also the term used for magic that deals with dark, unenlightened forces.Crowley denied this. Bennett then said, “In that case the Goetia has beenmeddling with you.” (Crowley believed that Yeats was casting spells at him,because of his poetry, and probably felt Bennett’s remark confirmed this.)Crowley had by this time decided to perform the Abramelin ritual. He had lefthis rooms at the Hotel Cecil and taken a flat at 67-69 Chancery Lane, a well-offstreet in the City of London. He had rented it under the name of Count VladimirSvareff. Crowley says he took this alias for three reasons. One was that inorder to perform the Abramelin magic properly, he had to cut himself off fromhis family. Another was his love for Russia. The other was as a sociologicalexperiment. He knew how people reacted to a young man from Cambridge, but howwould they react to a Russian nobleman? Crowley’s claim that he wanted toincrease his knowledge of mankind has some merit, but it is difficult to believethat many people would really believe he was Russian. (He even issued anotherbook of poetry, Jezebel, under that nom de plume; the reaction to it was muchthe same as to the earlier work by the gentleman from Cambridge.) Crowley’sexplanation suggests an attempt to break out of his own limited perspective, buteven as Count Svareff he was still Crowley pretending to be Russian. Mathers’sfantasy of being the Count of Glenstrae must have inspired him, and it isdifficult not to see Count Svareff and the other alter egos Crowley adopted asanother means of getting a response, and drawing attention to himself; Crowleyalways wanted his presence to be felt. George Cecil Jones, his tutor in magic,remarked that if he wanted solitude, he should have called himself Smith.Abramelin the Mage’s magic—to give him his full title—cannot be performed justanywhere.15 [index_split_019.html#filepos750065] Certain conditions must be met.It is unlike other magical rituals and is much more like an Eastern meditativetext. The invocations are much more like prayers. For six months the aspirantmust lead a holy and pure life and his mind must be focused on his soleobjective. He must “inflame himself with prayer” and “invoke often.” As IsraelRegardie writes, after finding a suitable place in which to perform theoperation, one has little else to do except “aspire with increasingconcentration and ardor . . . towards the Knowledge and Conversation of the HolyGuardian Angel.”16 [index_split_019.html#filepos750584] It is only after thisthat the traditional demons, talismans, and other regulation magicalparaphernalia get involved.A two-bedroom flat in London’s City may not have been the best location for thisholy exercise, but Count Svareff was determined to try. Crowley decked out hisflat with two “temples,” one for white magic, the other for black. He said hedid this in order to maintain the magical equilibrium, that confusing balancingact between good and evil he had started in 1886. The white temple was linedwith six large mirrors. This was in order to reflect the energies he invokedback at him. The black temple was empty except for an altar held up by an ebonystatue of an African standing on his hands. (Black magic, like antinomianism, iskeen on reversals.) Crowley also kept a skeleton in a cupboard that he fed withblood, small birds, and tea, aiming to return it to life. All he managed,though, was some slime covering the bones. The day after meeting Allan Bennett,Crowley went to the South London slum where Bennett was sharing a flat withanother Golden Dawn member. Looking at the squalor, Crowley suggested that, inexchange for magical instruction, Bennett come and live with him. Notsurprisingly, Frater Iehi Aour accepted. He must have been a good instructor.Soon after his arrival, life at Chancery Lane took a peculiar twist. All theconjurations, talismans, rituals, and other magical work started paying off. Onenight, returning from dinner with George Cecil Jones, Crowley found a ratherlarge and mysterious magical cat in his stairwell. His white temple had beenbroken into, the altar was overturned, and the furnishings were scattered about.Crowley says that 316 demons ran about the place, which suggests either verysmall demons or a very large flat.Bennett took a number of drugs to help with his asthma—opium, morphine, cocaine,and chloroform—and it was with Bennett that Crowley first began to experimentwith drugs. Bennett had a biting contempt for the body, and his health, alwaysfrail, was worsening. He needed to get to a warmer climate. Ceylon (Sri Lanka)was the place, as there he could also enter the path of the bhikkhu, a Buddhistmonk—Bennett was losing his interest in magic and was increasingly drawn to theBuddhist path. Crowley had inherited a fortune, but magical etiquette preventedhim from simply paying Bennett’s fare. Crowley says he could not pay Bennett forhis instructions, only give him room and board, yet why he couldn’t lend him themoney is unclear. Crowley and Jones attempted to evoke the spirit of Buer, ademon of the Goetia, who deals with health, but were only partially successful.Then Crowley had an idea.Initiation hadn’t dampened Crowley’s need for sex. He was having an affair withone initiate, Elaine Simpson (Soror Semper Fidelis—“Always Faithful”), and hadproposed marriage to Susan Strong, an American opera singer he had met in Paris(she performed in one of Mathers’s Egyptian rites), but his proposal soonfizzled out. He was also enjoying himself with a “seductive siren” whose husbandwas a colonel in India; her name was Lilian Horniblow but she was known as LauraGrahame.17 [index_split_019.html#filepos750779] Crowley says he struggled toovercome his passion for her, but he more likely simply tired of her and brokeit off. After Buer made a partial appearance, his siren wrote to him again,begging him to come to her hotel. Crowley saw a connection. He visited Laura,and she begged him to come back to her. Crowley was noncommittal, but he offeredher a chance to do something good for someone other than herself. He asked for ahundred pounds—a considerable sum then. He offered her no reason why, but saidit wasn’t for him and that he had a private reason for not using his own money.His siren gave him the money, or possibly a ruby ring to sell—the accounts areunclear. He gave the cash to Bennett, and Frater Iehi Aour made ready for warmerclimes.18 [index_split_019.html#filepos750934]Crowley implies that Bennett’s benefactor later agreed to end their affair if heslept with her again—the inference is that he impregnated her (she asked for “aliving memory of our love”) and she let him go to perform the Sacred Magic ofAbramelin the Mage.19 [index_split_019.html#filepos751055] The “gift” that savedBennett’s life would come back to haunt Crowley. His siren later thought betterof her generosity and asked that it be returned; it is unclear if it was a giftor a loan. Either way, Crowley had no intention of returning anything andvindicated himself with rationalizations. Crowley was later accused of stealinga hundred pounds. Charges were not brought against him—he did not actually stealthe money—but the mud stuck and would turn up years later during theanti-Crowley tabloid campaign.Crowley decided that Chancery Lane was no place to meet his Holy Guardian Angel.He needed somewhere more secluded for so serious an assignation. The fact thathis flat was under police observation because of suspected homosexual activitymay have been a prompt—it was still illegal then—as may have been the rent, orperhaps he didn’t want to face the demons he had conjured without Frater IehiAour’s help.20 [index_split_019.html#filepos751210] (After he left, the magicalatmosphere, he said, remained tense and the landlord had difficulty renting theplace.) In any case, he searched high and low and in August 1899 found what hewas looking for. Boleskine was a long, low building on the southeast riseoverlooking Loch Ness, halfway between Inverfarigaig and Foyers in Scotland;years later, Jimmy Page bought the place, and today it remains a site ofthelemic pilgrimage.21 [index_split_019.html#filepos751364] At the time Crowleymoved in, the Loch Ness monster was yet to appear—the first sighting was in1933—and one of the oddest explanations for Nessie’s existence (if she doesexist) is that Crowley was somehow responsible. (I’m not sure if Crowleyactually took credit for this, but I wouldn’t be surprised if he did.) Boleskineseemed perfect for what he had in mind. The plan was to begin the ritual thatcoming Easter. He set up his home in November, bringing with him the magicalmirrors of his white temple. He also started calling himself the Laird ofBoleskine. From a Russian count he became a Scottish lord.In between fishing, tramping on the moors, and seduction, Crowley also worked onhis magic. It seemed the spirit world was aware of his intentions, because evenbefore he began the Abramelin magic, things were afoot. The shadowy shapes thathad visited Chancery Lane turned up in Scotland, but as before, Crowley couldnot harness them. They caused much mischief. His coachman, who abstained fromalcohol, became a drunkard. When a psychic Crowley had shipped in returned toLondon, she gave up her calling and took to prostitution. One of his workmentried to kill him, and a local butcher died when he accidentally sliced throughhis artery. Crowley had absentmindedly jotted down some demonic names on abutcher bill and the spirits took advantage of this. And there were other, lessdangerous magical pursuits. Crowley invoked fire angels using one of theEnochian formulas of the Elizabethan magician Dr. John Dee—we will return tothese further on—and found himself speaking with other angels, rather as EmanuelSwedenborg had more than a century earlier. There was a battle between angels toprevent the squaring of the circle, he was told. He had a vision of Christ andof the Abyss of Water and of Chaos and Death (Crowley’s uppercase). These areearly accounts of the kind of visionary experience that occupied Crowley adecade later and were recounted in his book The Vision and the Voice.Yet other thoughts came to him. It was time, he thought, to receive his nextinitiation. He was supposed to be preparing to receive his Holy Guardian Angel,and focusing on Abramelin’s magic, but Crowley, as usual, was distracted. Fromthe shores of Loch Ness he descended on London and the mediocrities making upthe Golden Dawn. Crowley believed he was due to be advanced to the grade ofAdeptus Minor 50 = 6empty square [images/00005.jpg] but his brethren disagreed.They were not happy with the reports of the goings-on at Chancery Lane or withCrowley’s sexual conduct, and his performance as Count Svareff didn’t help. Thatthe Trades Protection Association had blacklisted Crowley for bad debts was alsonot a plus.22 [index_split_019.html#filepos751558] For Yeats, Crowley was a“quite unspeakable person,” and as far as he was concerned, the Golden Dawn wasnot intended to be a “reformatory.”23 [index_split_019.html#filepos751712] EvenJulian Baker, the man who brought Crowley in, considered him “a man withoutprinciples.” Israel Regardie suggests that Yeats and Co. were shocked byCrowley’s drinking, womanizing, and drug taking, but by this time Yeats himselfhad experimented with hashish and mescaline, in advance of Crowley, and was noprude; Yeats enjoyed both drugs but found hashish preferable for astraltraveling.24 [index_split_019.html#filepos751874] They knew of the Laura Grahameaffair, and even if that did not really involve theft, there was something aboutCrowley that rubbed his fellow magicians the wrong way. The portal was closed tohim.Undeterred, Frater Perdurabo crossed the Channel and on January 13, 1900,presented himself to Mathers. Clad in Highland dress, Crowley requested hisinitiation from the Count of Glenstrae, the leader of the order. Mathers nodoubt recognized Crowley’s magical potential, but at that point, the fact thathe had been turned away by Yeats and Co. was a singing endorsement.Mathers was not on good terms with his flock. The pension from Annie Hornimanhad ended in 1896 after he had quarreled with her and cast her out. Mathersbarely maintained himself and Moina on what he received from the Britishgroups—there were by then others in other parts of the country—but they wereincreasingly unhappy with his long-distance dictatorship. Baker had confided inCrowley that he believed Mathers was behaving badly and that he was weary of hisleadership.25 [index_split_019.html#filepos752085] Mathers had appointedFlorence Farr as his representative in London. She did her best but by the timeCrowley had appeared, she had had enough. She offered Mathers her resignationand suggested closing down the temple. Mathers was not keen on the idea andrefused. He needed Isis-Urania to provide new recruits for the Second Order;without them it would wither. Now it seemed that in order to prevent that fromhappening, fate had presented a recruit on his doorstep.Mathers received from Frater Perdurabo the oaths of obedience and secrecy, andit was done. Crowley was initiated and had entered the beauty of Tiphereth. Hetook the magical name Parzival, the “pure fool” of the Grail legend. He hadpassed through the portal and was now an Adeptus Minor 50 = 6empty square[images/00005.jpg], a member of the second order, whatever the mediocrities inLondon thought. He quickly discovered that they did not think much. When Crowleyarrived at 36 Blythe Road, Hammersmith, the Golden Dauns then office, soon afterhis initiation, and asked for the rituals pertinent to his new grade, theorder’s secretary, a Miss Cracknell, flatly refused. The Isis-Urania Temple didnot, she said, recognize his initiation. This was tantamount to saying they nolonger recognized Mathers’s authority. Crowley returned to Paris to inform hischief (and seems to have brought Laura Grahame along as some kind of reward forhelping Bennett). Mathers was furious, but was also concerned that the renegadesmight look to regroup with his old colleague Westcott as a leader. After all,Westcott had made contact with the mysterious Fraulein Sprengel and started itall. Mathers retaliated with a thunderbolt. On February 16 he wrote to FlorenceFarr and told her in no uncertain terms that Westcott had “NEVER been at anytime either in personal or written communication with the Secret Chiefs of theOrder” and that Westcott had “either himself forged or procured to be forged”the alleged correspondence with Anna Sprengel.26[index_split_019.html#filepos752240] Every atom of magical knowledge the orderpossessed came from him alone. Until then he had kept secret about this for thesake of the order but events forced his hand. No cipher manuscript had beenfound. No contact had been made. The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn had, itseems, been built on a lie. It was only through Mathers that any real contactwith the Secret Chiefs had been established and it was only through him that theGolden Dawn could have any real existence. For his part Westcott asserted thegenuineness of the Sprengel letters.Crowley did not realize that this made his own initiation doubtful. If there wasno Fraulein Sprengel, why should Mathers’s own account of the Secret Chiefs bebelieved? Such queries escaped him. He granted Mathers the kind of exceptionalstatus he generally reserved for himself. His master—so Mathers had become—couldnot be judged by “conventional codes and canons.” “Ordinary morality is only forordinary people,” and neither Mathers nor his new acolyte were ordinary.27[index_split_019.html#filepos752376] It was time for action. Crowley put asideAbramelin once again and offered Mathers his full support. Crowley drew up aplan of attack. This included a test of loyalty and oath of obedience that readslike something out of a Stalinist show trial.28[index_split_019.html#filepos752497] Those loyal would be reprimanded and forcedto show their allegiance; those not would be lowered in grade or simply castout. The delight Crowley took at the prospect of some magical skirmish at whichhe could confront the loathsome mediocrities is evident in the note about it hemade in his diary. He addressed himself as “I, Perdurabo, the Temporary EnvoyPlenipotentiary of Deo Duce Comite Ferro, & thus the Third from the SecretChiefs of the Order of the Rose of Ruby and Cross of Gold . . .” Throughout hiscareer Crowley loved adopting grand-sounding but vacuous titles, and one canimagine him gearing up for battle, waving his magic wand in front of his magicmirror, and perfecting an imperturbable stare.The Battle of Blythe Road quickly descended into farce. Soror Semper Fidelisproved to have less fidelity than her name, as she agreed to help Crowley in hisplan. The idea was to take possession of the Vault of Christian Rosenkreutz—orthe replica thereof—that resided on Blythe Road, a seven-sided room used forritual purposes whose design was based on the tomb of the founder of theRosicrucians.29 [index_split_019.html#filepos752629] On April 17, 1900, Crowleyand Elaine Simpson descended on 36 Blythe Road; Crowley had earlier engaged abouncer from a pub in Leicester Square to back him up. He trusted his magic buttook no chances. Crowley informed Miss Cracknell that they had come in Mathers’sname to take possession of the vault. Miss Cracknell headed for the nearest postoffice and sent a telegram to an E. A. Hunter, a member of the Second Order,saying what had happened. When Hunter arrived he discovered that Crowley hadtaken possession of the rooms and had installed new locks. For good measure hehad also written his name on the roll call of Second Order initiates. (Thisseems the kind of spiteful behavior reserved for adolescents.) While Hunter andMiss Cracknell confronted the plenipotentiary, Florence Farr turned up,understood the situation, and fetched a policeman. He requested that Crowleyleave. Two days later, while Yeats and Hunter remonstrated with the landlord forletting Crowley in the day before, Frater Perdurabo, Third from the SecretChiefs of the Order etc., appeared in Highland dress, complete with black mask,dagger, plaid, and gold cross, with Elaine at his side. Yeats and Hunter toldhim to leave. Crowley stood his ground, although he was somewhat anxious thatthe muscle he had hired in Leicester Square had failed to show. (He finally didonce the dust had cleared and explained that he couldn’t find the place.) Thisstruggle of magicians lasted until Yeats persuaded the landlord to get apoliceman who again requested that Crowley leave. Yeats then ejected Mathers andElaine from the Order. As Crowley was not in the Second Order—at least accordingto Yeats—the excommunication did not apply to him. In the end Crowley tried tosettle the matter in court, but lost the case and had to pay costs, aforeshadowing of future legal defeats. The Battle of Blythe Road was over, andso was the Golden Dawn.30 [index_split_019.html#filepos753375]Crowley returned to Paris and declared his mission a success. The rebel grouphad been dispersed, the dead wood chopped off. In reality he had made a mess ofthings but the order had grown moribund and his disruptive appearance at leastcleared a space for new developments. Yet by this time Crowley, too, was growingcold on Mathers. In his catastrophic letter to Florence Farr, Mathers hadannounced that Fraulein Sprengel was indeed not dead but still alive and workingwith him in Paris. When Crowley met Mathers, he discovered that his master hadbeen hoodwinked by a common scam. The woman who claimed to be in contact withAnna Sprengel was one Mrs. Horos, who had convinced Mathers of her authenticityby repeating certain secret remarks he had exchanged with Madame Blavatsky yearsearlier. Mrs. Horos, who also went by the names of Swami Vive Ananda and MarieLouise of the Commune, told Mathers that she had absorbed Blavatsky’s spiritafter her death (in 1891), hence her knowledge and also her weight; she wasobese, as Blavatsky had been. Mathers told Yeats that Mrs. Horos was “the mostpowerful medium living,” and it was through Mrs. Horos that Mathers believed hehad spoken with Fraulein Sprengel; how this left his revelation that her letterswere frauds is unclear.Mrs. Horos, whose real name was Editha Salomon, was an American adventuress, andshe had so convinced Mathers of her genuineness that he allowed her access tosome important Golden Dawn rituals. Mrs. Horos and her much younger husband,Frank Dutton Jackson, a defrocked priest, then sailed to South Africa, takingthe Golden Dawn material with them. It was at this point that Crowley heardabout them from Mathers, who now saw Mrs. Horos as a swindler—like Crowley, hewas an inveterate paranoid, accusing practically everyone around him of theft.The Horoses returned to London in 1901 and started their own version of theGolden Dawn, as well as a College of Occult Science. It was there that thetrouble started. Along with classes on magnetism, clairvoyance, mediumship, andthaumaturgy, the Horoses also practiced a kind of sex magick well in advance ofCrowley. Eventually the Horoses were accused of the kind of sexual offenses thatCrowley himself would attract years later, with unsuspecting virgins beingritually deflowered and other indecorous acts. The police became involved and inthe end Mr. Horos was sentenced to fifteen years in prison and Mrs. Horos toseven, for rape and theft, among other offenses. There was some cause for this,but as in the case of Crowley, their real crime was more likely breachingVictorian morality. Nevertheless, the trial brought the real Golden Dawn intodisrepute.31 [index_split_019.html#filepos753981]Crowley began to suspect that the Secret Chiefs had abandoned Mathers, too. Ifthat was the case, then he would have to look elsewhere for direction. It wastoo late to return to Boleskine and restart the Abramelin ritual. Yet again hisHoly Guardian Angel would have to wait. In Paris Crowley met two initiates,members of the Order who were Mathers’s guests. They had just returned fromMexico and spoke highly of it. What was the point of sitting quietly in oneplace, even if that was precisely what Abramelin required? The New Worldbeckoned. In late June 1900, Crowley sailed for New York, on his way south ofthe border."},{"pageContent":"THREETHE WORD OF THE AEON> [images/00004.jpg] Crowley arrived in New York in early July during a heat wave. His departure fromEngland may have had as much to do with the fact that the police wanted to speakwith him about Laura Grahame’s gift as with the debacle on Blythe Road or theglowing reports about Mexico he had heard from Mathers’s guests. He lingeredlong enough in his hotel room to make disparaging and inaccurate remarks aboutthe Statue of Liberty—in between taking cold baths—and after three swelteringdays he boarded a train for Mexico. His first impressions of the country wereequally morose. His fastidious tastes were repelled by the food, the poor hotelservice, and the unfamiliar liquor. But he was fated to endure to the end andeventually acclimated himself. He took a house in Mexico City overlooking theAlameda, and a woman to tend his needs. Here he discovered that he was, in fact,spiritually at one with Mexico. That the natives’ hearts were set on “bullfighting, cock fighting, gambling and lechery” made him feel right at home.1[index_split_019.html#filepos754373] He met an old man, Don Jesus Medina, ahigh-ranking Mason who was so impressed by Crowley’s Kabbalistic knowledge thathe initiated Crowley to the highest Masonic degree in practically no time.Although some commentators suggest that Mathers’s guests provided anintroduction to this master, there is about as much evidence for the realexistence of Crowley’s Don Jesus as there is for Carlos Castaneda’s Don Juan andso we must take this encounter with some grains of salt.2[index_split_019.html#filepos754527] Crowley also inaugurated his own magicalorder, the Lamp of the Invisible Light, or L.I.L., the aim of which was to havea temple with an ever-burning flame. Crowley claims that some of the secrets ofthe L.I.L. came from his previous incarnation as Cagliostro, theeighteenth-century Italian magician.Crowley practiced his magic dutifully. He developed a method of inducing atrance via a kind of magical dance that produced a peculiar lucidity. He alsodeveloped the power of invisibility, something that came in handy in some tightspots on his later adventures and which he also regularly practiced in London’sCafe Royal, a popular fin de siècle watering hole for writers and artists.3[index_split_019.html#filepos754685] The waiters there told a story of Crowleyparading around in full magical regalia, seemingly unnoticed until a visitorasked who he was. “Don’t worry,” the waiter replied, “that’s just Mr. Crowleybeing invisible.”4 [index_split_019.html#filepos754866] Crowley claimed that hereached a point where his image in the mirror would become faint and jittery,like an old film. But the real secret of invisibility is to make people notnotice you, which is really the art of misdirection, something all stagemagicians need to master. Crowley claimed that he could walk along a crowdedstreet wearing a gold crown and red robe without being noticed. We may laugh atsuch claims but most of us are familiar with the strange phenomenon of beingoverlooked when we do not want to attract someone’s attention. This may involvesome form of telepathy and Crowley’s invisibility may have been a more focusedvariant on this.Crowley’s magical advance hit a bump when he realized that most magicaldisciplines require a morally pure life—indeed such was the essence of theabandoned Abramelin work. Naturally he disagreed and explained that the truenecessity was to develop every aspect of one’s self. In order to accommodate hissexual and magical needs, Crowley took to practicing a kind of willed splitpersonality. He wore a jeweled gold ornament as a sign of his Second Orderstanding, and Crowley hit on a Jekyll-and-Hyde answer to his dilemma. When hewore the ornament, he would allow himself only the purest thoughts and actions,in accordance with his magical aspirations. When he wasn’t wearing it, he coulddo whatever he wanted except anything to do with magic. This expedient seemed towork well for Crowley but most readers, I think, will find his “mind switching”something of a rationalization. If the aim of personal development is to become“whole”—“individuated,” in Jung’s term—then allowing one side of yourself tocountermand the other with good conscience seems a way of avoiding this.5[index_split_019.html#filepos755112]At one point Crowley reminisced about Susan Strong, the opera singer he had beenbriefly engaged to, and recalled hearing her sing the part of Venus in Wagner’sTannhäuser. His excitement led him to pick up a Mexican woman who attracted himby the “insatiable intensity of passion that blazed from her evil inscrutableeyes and tortured her worn face into a whirlpool of seductive sin.”6[index_split_019.html#filepos755651] He spent some time with his torturedseductress in a slum and was so inspired by her lust—which no doubt helped hersupport herself—that he went back to his house and spent the next sixty-sevenhours writing his own version of Wagner’s mythological tale of sacred andprofane love, a feat, he tells us, that marked the climax of the first period ofhis poetic work.The dry air of Mexico was a positive encouragement for Crowley’s magical work.But that he was succeeding beyond his expectations did not please him. Insteadhe found that his advance was depressing him. He was getting what he wanted, butthis only made him realize that he wanted something else. His anxiety becameunbearable and as he had before, he sent out a magical distress signal. A letterfrom George Cecil Jones, he tells us, gave him the answer he needed, though whatexactly that was is unclear. But along with his magical needs, his inability tosit still was irritating him. He needed action, and in January 1901 a morevisceral relief arrived in the form of Oscar Eckenstein. The two planned toclimb Popocatépetl and Iztaccíhautl, both of which, at 17,000 feet, were higherthan the Alps. Eckenstein had no respect for Crowley’s magical work, consideringit pure rubbish. Although Crowley usually had no qualms about flexing hismagical muscles, in Eckenstein’s presence he became uncharacteristicallysheepish and was loath to speak of anything to do with his pursuits for fearthat Eckenstein would laugh. But Crowley’s magical distress was too great and atone point he spoke of his confusion. Eckenstein told him that his problem was aninability to control his thoughts and he offered instruction in this. Crowleywas so shaken by Eckenstein’s reprimand that he took an oath to masterconcentration. The kinds of exercises Eckenstein taught Crowley—visualizingobjects of increasingly complexity—seem much like the tattwa visualizingexercises practiced by the Golden Dawn and could not have appeared too unusualto him.7 [index_split_019.html#filepos755777] It is curious that both Bennettand Eckenstein—the two men Crowley really respected—saw mental discipline,something Crowley desperately needed, as essential.Eckenstein’s advice must have worked. The two headed to Amecameca, a town at thebase of both mountains, and spent three weeks at a camp 14,000 feet upIztaccíhautl, eating canned food, drinking champagne, and breaking worldrecords, at least according to Crowley. A comical incident occurred when, onreturning to civilization, they were told of the death of Queen Victoria, whohad ruled Britannia for sixty-three years. Expecting the Englishmen to beheartbroken, their host was surprised to see Crowley toss his hat into the airand jump for joy. At Colima they attempted to climb the active volcano butbacked down when the soles of their boots began to burn. At Popocatépetl theybrought along a journalist who had written disparagingly about their climbingability. Tying him between themselves, they raced to the summit at topspeed—Crowley and Eckenstein had already broken the record for uphill pace atgreat height. Eckenstein went ahead and pulled as Crowley brought up the rear,prodding his breathless companion with his axe. After this Crowley said thatthey had “achieved all our real objects” but more likely they were simply tiredof climbing and a more pressing matter dominated Crowley’s mind: the question ofMathers’s authority and his link to the Secret Chiefs, something, he believed,that Bennett could answer. He and Eckenstein agreed to meet soon to plan anexpedition to the Himalayas, where they would tackle Chogo Ri, K2, thesecond-highest mountain in the world. But for the time being they separated,Eckenstein heading for England and Crowley traveling north to San Francisco, enroute to visit Bennett in Ceylon.In El Paso, Texas, Crowley watched a man have his eyes gouged out over a cardgame. In San Francisco, he stayed in Chinatown. He liked the Chinese andinstantly recognized their superiority to Anglo-Saxons, but San Franciscoitself, a “madhouse of frenzied money-making and frenzied pleasure-seeking,”didn’t appeal.8 [index_split_019.html#filepos755903] Early May found Crowley onboard the Nippon Maru bound for Honolulu. He headed to Waikiki, where he fell inlove with an older American woman who was traveling with her adolescent son.9[index_split_019.html#filepos756029] Her name was Mary Beaton but Crowleydiscreetly calls her Alice. Like his Mexican prostitute with evil inscrutableeyes, Mary inspired Crowley and the result was Alice: An Adultery, a sonnetsequence, in which Crowley describes their amorous acts. These included sex enroute to Japan while Alice’s son was in the same cabin. On the Nippon Maru theyreached the Land of the Rising Sun and parted. Crowley’s sonnet sequenceimmortalized their doomed love—she regretfully had to return to her husband—butCrowley seems never to have considered that Alice simply wanted a holiday flingwith a younger man. Crowley insults her for luring him away from hissingle-minded quest and teaching him what women were worth, forgetting that hehad already been deflected from his fate several times by his own doing.Crowley didn’t like Japan or the Japanese, comparing them to the English—theywere, after all, two island nations—but ironically, given his later behavioramong “natives,” resenting their racial arrogance. This criticism may have beenprompted by his being turned away from a monastery near the Kamakura Daitbutsu,one of the huge statues of the Buddha that dot the island. His destiny layelsewhere, indeed, but the monks may have recognized trouble. The fact thatCrowley considered taking vows when he had already traveled across the Pacificen route to seek Bennett’s advice about an all-important question suggests that,once again, Crowley really had no idea what to do with himself. But he gave hiswandering some rationale, saying that he was sent here or there by order of theSecret Chiefs, much as Madame Blavatsky had mythologized her earlier journeys,saying they were ordained by her Hidden Masters.In Hong Kong Frater Perdurabo met with Soror Semper Fidelis hoping to receivesome magical solace. Since relocating she had turned her fidelity to herhusband—she was now Elaine Witkowski—and her magical days were behind her.Crowley was shocked to hear that she had worn her magical robes at a costumeball given by British expats and had won first prize. Disgusted with Elaine’sheresy as well as her reluctance to renew their intimacy, Crowley wandered toCeylon, which he reached on August 6. In Colombo he found Frater Iehi Aourtutoring the sons of Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan, the solicitor general ofCeylon, who later became the Shaivite guru Sri Parananda. Ramanathan was alsothe cousin of the art historian and Traditionalist philosopher Ananda K.Coomaraswamy, whose wife would later have an affair with Crowley. AlthoughCrowley found Ramanathan charming and cultivated—he had written a commentary onSaint Matthew that argues that Jesus was a yogi—he had no love of Hinduism andfelt that Bennett could do better. But the real reason for his visit, theall-important question, remained.And it remained unasked: we never know exactly what Crowley wanted to know. But,at least according to Crowley, it did not remain unanswered. We do know thatCrowley’s question revolved around an incident in which Bennett and Mathersargued about the Hindu god Shiva. It is said that if Shiva’s name is repeatedoften enough, he will open his eye and destroy the universe. Crowley suggeststhat Mathers took this personally, and that when Bennett began the mantra“Shiva, Shiva, Shiva,” Mathers threatened him with a pistol. Bennett, obliviousto all save his mantra, continued, and Mathers put the pistol to Bennett’s head.One account has Moina Mathers entering the room and saving Bennett’s life;another has Mathers finally cowed by Bennett’s greater faith. It is unclear whatthis strange but typical tale has to do with Crowley’s magical distress, exceptthat his remark—“Mathers thus disposed of, to business!”—suggests that itsomehow cleared the way for his further magical advancement.Bennett’s health was suffering and Crowley convinced him to relocate to the morebeneficial climes of Kandy. There Crowley rented a bungalow overlooking a lakeand for six weeks he again undertook instruction from Bennett, this time in yogaand meditation. Practically everything Crowley knew about yoga came from thistime with Bennett. Yoga formed a large part of Crowley’s magical teaching. Itmakes up a good portion of his first magical handbook, Book Four, and his ideasabout “higher consciousness” are usually couched in Buddhist or Hindu terms. Oneof his best works is the Eight Lectures on Yoga, a series he gave in London in1937 and which was published many years later. Crowley’s approach is simple,clear, and unencumbered by jargon. “I propose to invoke the most remote andelusive of all Gods,” he told his audience, “the light of common sense.” “Yoga,”he tells us, “is first of all the union of the subject and the object ofconsciousness: of the seer with the thing seen.”10[index_split_019.html#filepos756886] As with his magical apprenticeship, Crowleytook to his lessons avidly and within a few weeks had reached this union, knownas Dhyana. Crowley’s aim in pursuing yoga was not the same as Bennett’s. He didnot seek withdrawal from the world but the ability to “produce genius atwill”—part of what Crowley called “Scientific Illuminism”—genius being in thissense the liberation of consciousness from mundane cares and a broadening andexpansion of its power, an idea he discovered in William James’s classic TheVarieties of Religious Experience. He recognized that in this sense yoga andmagic have a common aim, the attainment of Samadhi, the highest level of Dhyana,being practically identical with the magical “assumption of the god form.”After a time the two realized they had to part. Bennett had decided to take thelast step in becoming a monk; Crowley went big-game hunting in India. The ideawas to eventually meet up with Eckenstein for their ascent of Chogo Ri. Oncemore Abramelin had faded into the background in the face of Crowley’swanderlust. At one point Crowley again tried his hand at entering a monastery,and this time he had better luck than in Japan. Outside the great temple atMadura, Crowley sat in a loincloth with a begging bowl in hand. His hero RobertBurton had entered Mecca disguised as a Muslim, and Crowley wanted to followsuit. The natives saw through his disguise—Crowley was about as good a fauxHindu as he was a fake Russian—but his sincerity was evident and they allowedhim into a secret shrine where he sacrificed a goat to Bhavani, the fearsomedestructive face of the goddess Parvarti. When a desire to see Bennett once moretook hold, Crowley decided to make the dangerous journey across the Arakan hillsto the monastery in south Burma where Bennett was living. En route with acompanion in a dugout canoe on the Irrawaddy, Crowley came down with fever andhallucinated that the jungle was speaking to him and that he could feel theelemental spirits of nature. He then passed the time blasting away at everythinghe could with his rifle. One duck persisted in avoiding his barrage and soinfuriated the master of Dhyana that he went ashore after it. The duck finallymade the fatal mistake of flying overhead and Crowley potted it. Regardiesurmises that for all his yogic training, a “fundamental hostility” remained inCrowley, as was evident in this rampant killing.11[index_split_019.html#filepos757107]On February 14, 1902, Crowley reached Akyab, where he found Bennett in themonastery of Lamma Sayadaw Kyoung. Bennett was tall and stood out amid theshorter Burmese. But he was Frater Iehi Aour no longer. Bennett had joined thesangha, the community of monks, and was now the Bhikkhu Ananda Metteya, “Blissof Loving Kindness.”12 [index_split_019.html#filepos757271] Magic was behindhim, as was much else. Crowley tells the story of how Bennett, coming across apoisonous snake in the road, preached the four noble truths to it and exhortedit to banish its anger.13 [index_split_019.html#filepos758004] The snake bit hisumbrella and then passed on. Bennett had become something of a guru and manyvisitors came to see the European bhikkhu, or monk. While they were together,Bennett and Crowley discussed plans for the spread of Buddhism to the West, butCrowley was often on his own and found time to work on his poem “Ahab” and tostudy Hindustani in preparation for K2. He also took to smoking opium, which hehad already experimented with back in Chancery Lane. Crowley tells how, afterseveral days in which the food and water brought to Bennett’s hut remaineduntouched, concerned monks came to him, worried about the white bhikkhu. Crowleywent to investigate and found his guru levitating, his motionless body rockinggently in the breeze.On March 23, Crowley met Eckenstein in Delhi. Two days earlier he had written“Berashith,” an “Essay in Ontology,” his first attempt at metaphysics of magic.Berashith is a Hebrew word meaning “in the beginning.” It is the first word ofGenesis and according to Kabbalah contains the secret of existence. Crowleyclaims to have “re-discovered the long lost and central Arcanum” of the “divinephilosophers.”14 [index_split_019.html#filepos758164] Although filled withBuddhist ideas, Crowley’s movement away from Buddhism is clear. He rejectsBuddha’s silence regarding the question of how existence began and asserts the“absoluteness of the Qabalistic Zero.” Crowley uses arcane mathematics to arriveat an idea of a positive nothingness about which we can nevertheless make noconcrete statement.15 [index_split_019.html#filepos758354] Before creation thispositive nothingness neither existed nor didn’t exist—“the idea of existence wasjust as much unformulated as that of toasted cheese,” one of Crowley’s morememorable insights—but it was out of this pregnant Nothing that the universeemerged. Crowley’s remark that “There is not and could not be any cause” sitswell with contemporary ideas about cosmogony, as voiced by Stephen Hawking; inThe Grand Design (2010), Hawking declared that “spontaneous creation” was allthat was necessary to get things going, the universe beginning in a “quantumfluctuation in a pre-existing vacuum,” having no need of a creator. Crowley hereis trying to grasp the ungraspable, the realm of being beyond the Supernals. Hisargument may not convince us, but the gist is clear. He is making his way to theAbyss.But before he reached those depths he would scale some heights. At 28,251 feet,K2 towers less than a thousand feet below Mount Everest. Crowley would no doubthave preferred to attempt Everest, but at that time it was off-limits toEuropeans. K2, however, is a more dangerous climb and has acquired the nicknameof the “Savage Mountain”; this element of risk must have piqued Crowley’sinterest. It was first surveyed in 1856 and is known as K2 because it is thesecond peak of the Karakorum Range; Chogo Ri is a kind of nickname and simplymeans “big mountain.” Crowley and Eckenstein’s expedition was the first toattempt this titan, and it was not until 1954 that its summit was reached.Although ultimately unsuccessful—they got as far as 21,407 feet before turningback—Crowley and Eckenstein did set some records, including the longest timespent at such altitude (sixty-eight days). Given the treacherous conditions andthe lack of modern gear—they had, for example, no oxygen tanks—that theexpedition got as far as it did is remarkable, and Crowley rightly felt proud ofthis climb.Eckenstein was the expedition’s leader and he had gathered a few other climbers.In Delhi Crowley met up with Guy Knowles, a young Cambridge man with no climbingexperience; J. Jacot Guillarmod, a Swiss doctor and mountaineer; and twoAustrian rock climbers, Heinrich Pfannl and Victor Wessely. Typically, Crowleyhas nothing good to say about any of them; Crowley was second in command andeveryone had to sign an agreement pledging total obedience to Eckenstein.Crowley countermanded this obedience just before the true climb began, when herefused to jettison the bundle of poetry books he had brought with him.Eckenstein argued they would weigh him down but Crowley could not abandonMilton, so Eckenstein gave way. Although Crowley claimed that he paid the bulkof the expedition’s expenses, Symonds reports that Knowles rejected this andclaimed that Crowley didn’t spend a cent.16 [index_split_019.html#filepos758520]That Crowley had ill will toward his companions did not bode well for the trek,and things got off to a bad start when Eckenstein was detained for three weeksby the authorities at Rawalpindi. No clear reason was given but most likely hewas suspected of being a German spy.This, however, was the least of their worries. Crowley did not get on well withthe natives, and some of the “racial arrogance” he criticized in the Japaneseappeared when he felt obliged to beat the leader of their drivers with his belt.Crowley claimed this was necessary in order to win the coolies’ respect. “Thefirst business of any traveler in any part of the world is to establish hismoral superiority,” he tells us.17 [index_split_019.html#filepos758674]Crowley’s moral superiority soon became a matter of concern and reappeared in alater climb. Dr. Guillarmod, who Crowley claimed “knew as little of mountains ashe did of medicine,” had a different approach and set up a temporary clinicwherever they stopped, doing whatever he could to help people who rarely, ifever, saw a doctor.18 [index_split_019.html#filepos758834] Although Eckensteinwas at least half German, Crowley referred to Guillarmod, Pfannl, and Wessely as“undesirable aliens,” and would have preferred to have more Englishmen about.They started out optimistically but soon the odds seemed against them. Theweather wasn’t promising, the terrain was grueling, and the sheer size of theSavage Mountain overwhelmed. Crowley had a flare-up of malaria and suffered fromsnow-blindness. His remedy for this, and for the exhaustion that overcame him,was to drink champagne. His fever was so bad that he hallucinated butterflies inthe snow and he became paranoid about Knowles and threatened him with a pistol.Knowles didn’t trust Crowley and quickly disarmed him, keeping the pistol as amemento, a humiliation Crowley didn’t report in his Confessions. At one pointPfannl went mad (a condition he felt only Crowley could understand) and Wessely,who Crowley paints as a glutton, stole the food supplies; a court-martial wasplanned. On July 10 the party reached its highest point, but the weather hadbroken and promised to remain bad. The days for climbing farther were lost; evenremaining where they were was exhausting. The Savage Mountain had beaten them;by August they were retreating down the glacier. It was Crowley’s first majordefeat. Had he been successful, he would have been “the man who climbed K2” andthe world would have known about it. He would have been established—and in manyways it is a shame the attempt was unsuccessful. We’ve seen that Crowley was atpeace with himself only on the mountains. He devotes a large section of theConfessions to the expedition and it is clear that it meant a great deal to him.But now he was once again a wanderer of the wastes, and he had to press on.Crowley left Bombay en route to Paris in October 1902. He had spent the weeksafter K2 shooting, traveling, and sightseeing. He stopped off at Cairo butavoided the pyramids, preferring instead the sophisticated entertainments atShepheard’s Hotel, an Egyptian watering hole established in 1841 whose famousvisitors included Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Mark Twain, and Noel Coward. TodayCrowley is mentioned among its illustrious guests.19[index_split_019.html#filepos758961] In Paris he stayed with his friend thepainter Gerald Kelly. While Crowley had been traveling around the world, Kellywas establishing himself as an important artist. The two had been correspondingand Crowley, never one to flinch at asking favors, invited himself to visit. Heof course wanted to touch base with his fellow Cambridge man, but the realreason for the visit was the serious business with Mathers. Bennett had answeredhis question and the way forward was open.Crowley hoped to impress Mathers with his travels, his adventures, his knowledgeof yoga, and his magical development. He wanted to be greeted as an equal, muchas he wanted Yeats to greet him four years earlier. But when they met inMontmartre, where Mathers was living, his old master was singularlyuninterested. In a letter to Kelly, Crowley anticipated this meeting as his Hourof Triumph, but the reunion was anticlimactic. Men such as Crowley and Matherscould not meet as equals and the tension was building. Crowley began his attackby inferring that Mathers had pawned an expensive dressing case and bag he hadasked him to store while he was away. Mathers was as poor as ever and mostlikely did pawn them; this ignominious act lowered Mathers in Crowley’s eyes.Mathers had been in contact with the Secret Chiefs; of that Crowley had nodoubt. But something had happened and he had fallen. Ironically, Crowleysuggests Mathers’s fall came about through rashly invoking the forces of theAbramelin magic, something, as mentioned, often said about Crowley himself.20[index_split_019.html#filepos759155] Evidence for Mathers’s descent came in theform of a certain Mrs. M, who, according to Crowley, turned out to be a vampire,sent by Mathers to seduce his ex-pupil. In the Confessions Crowley quotes theaccount given by his first biographer and advocate, J.F.C. Fuller, who we willmeet further on.21 [index_split_019.html#filepos759310] Kelly is supposed tohave asked Crowley to help free a certain Miss Q from the designs of a Mrs. M.Mrs. M, Kelly told Crowley, was a vampire and sculptor who was making a sphinxwith the intention of giving it life; Miss Q was her victim. Crowley contrived ameeting and, alone with Mrs. M, saw her, “a middle aged woman worn with strangelusts” (exactly the kind of look designed to appeal to Crowley) transform into a“young woman of bewitching beauty.” The lustful Mrs. M now made advances onCrowley. Crowley knew that his life was at stake, so he began a “magicalconversation,” which sent her evil energies back at her. After a struggle ofwills, Mrs. M was transformed once again, this time into a hag of sixty, andCrowley left. Something suggested that Mrs. M could not be working alone and hewas determined to discover her superiors. He then consulted a psychic who had avision of Mathers’s home in Montmartre. There were Mathers and Moina, but it wasCrowley’s shock to discover that their bodies had been taken over by the evilMr. and Mrs. Horos! No wonder Mathers hadn’t been impressed with Crowley’sdevelopment: he was in the thrall of that evil couple.Kelly denied that there was any truth in the story, but in one sense this hardlymatters. Whether there actually was a Mrs. M or not, or whether or not she was avampire and had anything to do with Mathers, one thing is clear. Crowley neededto justify his assault on Mathers and this episode allowed him to. EitherMathers had allowed these creatures to possess him—their physical bodies were atthe time serving prison sentences for sex offenses, but no matter—or he wasunwillingly their slave. Either way, the contact with the Secret Chiefs wasundoubtedly broken, and who else but Frater Perdurabo could renew it?But before making that contact Crowley was keen to make some others. Kellyintroduced Crowley to the crowd of artistes and poètes who frequented Le ChatBlanc, a restaurant near Gare Montparnasse on la Rive Gauche, the bohemian partof Paris. Crowley was eager to ingratiate himself with Kelly’s friends, a circleof British expats that included the novelist Arnold Bennett, the art criticClive Bell, and the writer Somerset Maugham; throughout his career, Crowleyalways sought out the latest “in crowd” and tried to make himself at home in it.Crowley was not very successful and the clique wouldn’t have him, but he usedthe milieu in the introduction to another collection of pornography, Snowdropsfrom a Curate’s Garden (1904), where he speaks of that “witty and high-thinkinginformal club” at the restaurant “Au Chien Rouge.” Snowdrops was written,Crowley tells us, to amuse his first wife following her pregnancy; chaptertitles such as “The Cocksucker’s Crime” and “The Futile Fuck-stick” give us someidea of how she was amused.22 [index_split_019.html#filepos759442]The attitude of the crowd at Le Chat Blanc toward Crowley is best expressed inMaugham’s preface to his early novel The Magician, whose eponymous villain,Oliver Haddo, is based on Crowley. By the time Maugham met him, Crowley’sathletic frame had broadened and his hair was thinning—he was on his way to hisby-now-iconic shaven head—and his eyes, Maugham writes, had a way of focusing sothat “when he looked at you, he seemed to look behind you.”23[index_split_019.html#filepos760142] “He was a fake,” Maugham says, “but notentirely a fake.” “He was a liar and unbecomingly boastful, but the odd thingwas that he had actually done some of the things he had boasted of.” Maughamgoes further than Yeats in allowing Crowley some credit for his poetry, sayinghis verse is “not entirely without merit” although it was usually “intolerablyverbose.” And Maugham sees through the image of the shocking diabolist thatCrowley tried hard to create. Oliver Haddo was a villain, a black magicianintent on using an innocent virgin for his evil designs, but he is “morestriking in appearance, more sinister and more ruthless than Crowley ever was.”Maugham’s novel was published in 1908 and some years later it was made into asilent film by the director Rex Ingram. Long before the Beatles had ever heardof him, the myth of Crowley was seeping into popular culture. Kelly’s ownreminiscences of the scene were on par with Maugham’s: “Crowley was widelyunknown in the Montparnasse quarters”—a witticism that would have gone down wellat Au Chien Rouge—“he was, for the most part, disliked by the few whom hemet.”24 [index_split_019.html#filepos760330]Crowley did meet some Parisian artists. The writer Marcel Schwob was one, as wasthe sculptor Auguste Rodin, whose famous statue of Balzac was at the timecausing controversy. Crowley came to his defense with a sonnet; Schwobtranslated it into French and Rodin approved. Crowley was much impressed byRodin and wrote Rodin in Rime for him, a study of his statues in verse. Crowleymade much of his visit to Rodin’s studio in Meudon, but he was one among manyvisitors to the old master’s workroom.—MAGICIAN, BUDDHIST, poet, mountaineer? Back in Europe Crowley was still unsurewhich direction to head in. He had a nagging sense that he should return toAbramelin but the business with Mathers put him off, and in any case magic hadreceded in the light of Buddhism. His essay “Science and Buddhism” (1903), anearly effort in “Scientific Illuminism,” which argues that Buddhism and sciencestart from the same principles, makes this clear. (Here Crowley was taking histack from other writers; Edward Carpenter—who, unlike Crowley, was open abouthis homosexuality—had argued much the same points in From Adam’s Peak toElephanta [1892] and for years the Theosophical Society had as its motto “ThereIs No Religion Higher than Truth.”) His travels and adventure on Chogo Ri madehim feel he had accomplished something, but he had no idea where to go fromthere. Although he felt that the “big people in the artistic world in France”should have welcomed him, he was still an outsider, self-publishing his work,trying to get a foot in the door. His spiritual state was enfeebled, he wasgetting a swelled head, and, not surprisingly, he found himself “completelydisillusioned with regard to the universe.”25[index_split_019.html#filepos760501] This malaise, however, did not prevent himfrom pursuing sinful pleasures, but these, too, had their dangers. One encounterwas with the model Nina Oliver, whom he met in Kelly’s studio. Another was withanother model with whom he became engaged “out of sheer lack of moral energy,” amotivating force already at work in his aborted engagement to Susan Strong.26[index_split_019.html#filepos760628] Perhaps it was this that decided him. Afterone last visit to Mathers’s house—he burgled the place to retrieve robes andother magical accoutrements he had bought for the order—Crowley pulled up stakesagain and in June 1903 headed back to Boleskine.There he did not return to Abramelin but dabbled in other magic. He tookMathers’s translation of the Goetia and published it with an introduction, “TheInitiated Interpretation of Ceremonial Magic,” giving the author as “A DeadHand.”27 [index_split_019.html#filepos760756] Mathers received no credit for hiswork. Crowley whiled away his time with a woman he had picked up in London;evidently she wasn’t entertaining enough, and Crowley tried to relieve hisboredom through a practical joke. He wrote to the local VigilanceSociety—neighborhood protectors of morality—complaining that prostitution in thelocal area was “most unpleasantly conspicuous,” signing his missive “AleisterMacGregor,” a sign, perhaps, that he was assuming Mathers’s status. After athorough investigation, the society replied that they could find no evidence ofprostitution whatsoever. To this the Laird of Boleskine exasperatedly answered,“Conspicuous by its absence, you fools!” Even this didn’t liven things up andCrowley was again at loose ends. Even his houseguest, a renegade PlymouthBrethren named Duncombe-Jewell who was obsessed with the Celtic Revival, was notsufficient distraction, and in Edinburgh Crowley arranged for ahousekeeper-companion—“redheaded Arabella”—to fill the void (one assumes thewoman from London had left). Arabella could not come then, but she would soon.In Edinburgh he had also met Gerald Kelly, who had accepted his invitation tostay at Boleskine. No sooner had Kelly settled in than he received a letter fromhis mother asking him to see her about an urgent matter. Crowley was thankfulfor the distraction and he and Kelly rushed to Strathpeffer to discover thatKelly’s sister Rose had gotten herself in a terrible jam. She had acceptedproposals of marriage from two men, neither of whom she loved and both of whomwere on their way to retrieve their bride-to-be. She was also having an affairwith a married man. Rose was a widow and a woman of some experience; she hadlied about being pregnant and bought clothes with the money her family had givenher for an abortion. Now her parents were determined to make an honest woman ofher. They demanded she marry one of her suitors—which one didn’t matter, onlythat she choose. Crowley had met Rose before but was not impressed. Now,however, her plight piqued his fancy. Such family squabbles always brought outthe knight in him—we remember his experience in Eastbourne—and AleisterMacGregor, clad in Highland gear and tartan, proposed a simple, obvioussolution. She should marry him.Crowley explained that his offer was pure chivalry and that no romance wasinvolved. Once married, they could separate and lead their own lives, but shewould be free from familial pressure. Rose, who was almost as erratic asCrowley, was touched and agreed. They tried to get married that afternoon butwere told at the local church that they would have to publish banns and waitthree weeks. Clearly that wouldn’t do. They then discovered that according toScottish law, they merely had to declare their intentions to any lawyer. Thenext morning they slipped out of the house before breakfast and headed for thenearest town, where, at eight, they were declared man and wife by a drowsyattorney. To seal the union, Crowley drew a dagger from his stocking—shades ofMathers—and kissed it. He wouldn’t think of kissing the bride. By then Kelly hadcaught wind of the plan and as the knot was tied, he burst into the room andtried to punch Crowley.Immediately after, Crowley returned to Boleskine and Rose to Strathpeffer.Rose’s family was up in arms and consulting lawyers. Crowley sentDuncombe-Jewell to Strathpeffer to clarify things: Rose was his wife and therewas nothing anyone could do about it. He had kicked up quite a storm in thesleepy Scottish Highlands, yes indeed, which is exactly what Crowley wanted; tothink that he had scandalized the county was delightful. He and Rose wererequired to register their marriage with the county sheriff, and so the two wentto Dingwall, the county seat. To keep up appearances, he and Rose decided toenjoy a mock-honeymoon. They took a train to the end of the line, where Rosebooked a double room at the hotel, rather than two singles, which Crowley feltwas unsporting. Crowley admits that he couldn’t face the clerk and let her dothe work; he contemplated the sea and thought of suicide. Uncharacteristically,he reflected on what had happened and had second thoughts. The idea may haveoccurred to him that this business was simply a nuisance for someone intent onhis Holy Guardian Angel, but there it was; the impossibilist had struck again.At dinner they drank a lot of champagne. While Rose went to their room Crowleytroubled a guest with conversation. There was no escape, but first a poem. “Roseon the breast of the world of spring / I press my breast against thybloom . . .” It came to Crowley in a flash that his chivalrous act had allowedRose to transfer her wayward love to him. This, of course, touched him deeply.The next day the two returned to Boleskine, where Crowley acquiesced and was“prepared to propitiate physiology” and consummate their sudden marriage,although the problem of Arabella had to be dealt with. He had no feeling forher, just as he had “absolute indifference to Rose,” but she was on her way andhe sent Duncombe-Jewell to head her off. By now he realized that he was marriedto “one of the most beautiful and fascinating women in the world” and would makethe best of it. He was of course in love with her, too. Never mind that she hadlittle education and less intellect, their honeymoon was an “uninterruptedbeatitude” and “sexual debauch,” except for when Rose took some trifling libertyand, like the natives of some heathen land, had to be apprised of her husband’smoral superiority. A week or so into their bliss, he had the sad duty of havingto administer a spanking to his new wife.28 [index_split_019.html#filepos760983]Like all “moral inferiors,” she had to be shown who was boss.29[index_split_019.html#filepos761138] Rose “exercised on every man she met afascination which I have never seen anywhere else,” but he knew when to wallopher.30 [index_split_019.html#filepos761259]Scotland was no place for such a jewel, so they headed to Paris. Here they cameupon Moina Mathers, crossing the Pont Alexandre III. Crowley claimed she hadbecome a prostitute and that Mathers had forced her to pose naked at aMontmartre tourist trap, but this is merely Crowley at his nastiest. He informedhis brother-in-law that any correspondence must be addressed to “LordBoleskine,” “Aleister Crowley” downgraded now to only a nom de plume. AtMarseilles they boarded a ship to Cairo, where Crowley persuaded a guard toallow them to spend a night in the King’s Chamber of the Great Pyramid. HereRose helped him invoke the god Thoth. Crowley’s magic was working: as he readthe invocation from the Goetia, an astral light filled the chamber and Crowleyfound that they no longer needed their candles. Next stop was Ceylon again(Crowley’s travels are nothing if not dizzying) where, in between composing aseries of love poems—Rosa Mundi—he once again blasted away at whatever he couldwith a rifle (chapters of the Confessions are filled with his relish forbig-game hunting). He wanted to make a waistcoat out of bat fur and startled aflock of bats with his first shot. One wounded bat got tangled in Rose’s hairand caused her a fright. That night Rose woke Crowley with her squeals. He foundher, stark naked, clinging to the overhead bed frame. It was difficult to pullher down and when he tried, she bit him, mimicking in her sleep the last momentsof the bat that had landed on her. Crowley diagnosed her state—“the finest caseof obsession that I ever had the good fortune to observe”—as congruent with hercondition. Around this time they discovered that Rose was pregnant.31[index_split_019.html#filepos761386]It was January 1904, and the reality of Rose’s pregnancy turned the newlywedstoward Europe. They had originally planned to visit Bennett, who had moved toRangoon, but the fates decreed otherwise; destiny was about to intervene in thelife of Aleister Crowley. En route they stopped at Cairo, where Crowley wentthrough another metamorphosis. He was now the Persian Prince Chioa Khan (Hebrewfor “Great Beast”). Unlike his previous identities—which he claims he adoptedfor “definite and legitimate reasons”—this new one was sheer swagger and borneof a desire to have “two gorgeous runners clear the way for my carriage throughthe streets of Cairo.”32 [index_split_019.html#filepos761513] As with LordBoleskine, all correspondence had to be addressed accordingly. When Rose’smother added an exclamation point to “Princess Chioa Khan,” her letter was sentback.The Secret Chiefs had been quiet of late. Mathers was now a dead connection.They needed a new contact in the mundane world. Crowley needed them in order toestablish his own magical order; this had been his aim for some time. But how todo it? Crowley’s magic was warming up. He claims that a sheik who taught himArabic, recognizing that he was an initiate, introduced him to the ArabicKabbalah, and taught him certain conjuring tricks, such as eating a livescorpion and licking a red-hot blade. But such parlor games were balanced byplaying golf and shooting quail. Crowley emphasizes these banal pastimes to showthat the next development in his life, the actual meaning of it, arrived out ofthe blue.On March 16, Crowley and Ouarda the Seer—as he was now calling his wife,“Ouarda” being Arabic for Rose—took a flat near Cairo’s famous Boulak Museum. Inorder to entertain Rose, Crowley tried to invoke the sylphs—air elementals—byrepeating the ritual that had worked so well in the King’s Chamber. Ouardawasn’t amused and kept repeating, “They are waiting for you,” much to Crowley’sannoyance. The next day Crowley tried again but again all Rose would say is “Itis all about the child” and “all Osiris,” Osiris being the Egyptian resurrectiongod. Rose then informed Crowley that he had somehow offended the Egyptian godHorus, the son of Isis and Osiris. Crowley was bemused. Rose knew nothing aboutEgyptian mythology. But she went on to tell him how to invoke Horus, andalthough Crowley thought her directions were nonsense, she insisted and Crowleycomplied. When he questioned her about her sudden knowledge, her answersimpressed him. Then, in the Boulak Museum—which they hadn’t yet visited—Ouardapicked out a stele, a commemorative slab, depicting the particular god with whomshe seemed to be in communication. Although Rose had no idea how Horus wasdepicted, and was too far away from the stele to see it properly, the stele wasindeed of Horus, but in his relatively rare form as Ra-Hoor-Khuit, a titlemeaning “Ra of the horizon.” Crowley was impressed that the catalog number forthe stele was 666—his own chosen number. On March 20, Crowley was astonishedthat the “absurd” ritual Rose had compelled him to perform, in full robes infront of an open window, was a success. Rose “channeled” the god and toldCrowley that “the Equinox of the Gods” had come. A new epoch in mankind’shistory had arrived and Crowley was its chosen voice. It would be through himthat the “word of the aeon” would be expressed. He was, in short, the Messiah,whose task it was to forge a link between mankind and the solar-spiritual forcethat was making its presence known. The Secret Chiefs, it seems, were makingcontact.This was confirmed—at least to Crowley’s satisfaction—when Rose informed himthat his Holy Guardian Angel, whose name, she said, was Aiwass, wanted him toreceive an important message. Aiwass, he was told, was a Secret Chief of thegrade Ipsissimus—the highest one—and at noon on April 8, 9, and 10, he was tosit at his desk in his temple—they had erected one in the flat—and write downwhat he heard. Crowley did so, taking down the dictation with his Swan fountainpen. He remarked that Aiwass’s musical voice came over his left shoulder fromthe farthest corner of the room. For exactly an hour each day Aiwass spoke andwhat he revealed to Crowley was The Book of the Law."},{"pageContent":"FOURWHAT IS THE LAW?> [images/00004.jpg] The Book of the Law is the crux of Crowley’s philosophy. He believed in itwithout qualification, and he also believed in its source as a discarnate,higher intelligence. On this point Crowley was no fake. Crowley believed in theliteral truth of this new holy scripture just as his Plymouth Brethren fatherbelieved in the literal truth of the Bible. Anyone who reads Crowley’s manycommentaries on The Book of the Law will agree that on this he was sincere. Hebegins the chapter of the Confessions dedicated to The Book of the Law withsolemn words: “This chapter is the climax of this book. Its contents are soextraordinary, they demand such breadth and depth of preliminary explanation,that I am in despair.”1 [index_split_019.html#filepos761731] He then clarifiesthe book’s claims, one of which, to “open up communications with discarnateintelligences,” constitutes “the supreme importance” of the work.2[index_split_019.html#filepos761885] Although the most likely origin of The Bookof the Law is Crowley’s own unconscious mind, I accept the possibility that itmay have come from a disembodied intelligence of some kind. I don’t rule out thepossibility of such intelligences, although, I must admit, I have had noexperience of them.Two of Crowley’s contemporaries, however, did. W. B. Yeats and C. G. Jung bothproduced work that they claimed originated in a similar mysterious source.Yeats’s A Vision (1925), which presents a unique system of personality typesbased on the phases of the moon (and which deserves more notice), was“transmitted” by his wife through automatic writing; strangely, this happened ontheir honeymoon, just as with Rose and Crowley. And Jung’s strange Gnosticdocument The Seven Sermons to the Dead (ca. 1916) came to him in a kind ofwaking dream, communicated by voices who had “come back from Jerusalem” wherethey “found not what we sought.” Both The Seven Sermons to the Dead and The Bookof the Law are written in a bombastic, quasi-biblical style, which Jung said wasthe language of the archetypes. That both Jung and Crowley knew their Bible musthave had something to do with this; Jung’s family, too, was deeply religious.And Jung, too, believed that he communicated with “discarnate” beings such ashis “inner guru,” Philemon.3 [index_split_019.html#filepos762011] Jung himselfwas of two minds about the value of The Seven Sermons to the Dead and remainedequivocal about it throughout his life; at one point he intended to publish it,but then changed his mind.4 [index_split_019.html#filepos762154] And he kept hislegendary Red Book, the larger collection of similarly “received”material—paintings and strange prose-poems—pretty much “top secret” during hislife; it was only published in 2009, almost a half century after his death.5[index_split_019.html#filepos762280] That Jung was at times embarrassed aboutThe Seven Sermons to the Dead and the material in the Red Book does not, ofcourse, prove that it was, as he sometimes believed, a youthful indiscretion andshould be ignored; many readers have gained much from it.6[index_split_019.html#filepos762411] But it does show that, unlike Crowley, hehad his doubts about it.But even if it was true that the voice Crowley heard was that of a discarnateintelligence, there is no guarantee that it was necessarily “higher,” or that itspoke the truth. Madame Blavatsky became Public Enemy No. 1 to manyspiritualists because she argued that the voices heard at séances were not thoseof the beloved deceased or “spirit guides” but often that of bored, garrulousentities who were happy to tell their audiences whatever they wanted to hear.7[index_split_019.html#filepos762643] Anyone who reads through much “channeled”material soon has a similar experience: one recognizes its vaguely “spiritual”but strangely contentless character. Whether such communications originate in adiscarnate intelligence or not, generally they are not vastly different fromwhat we can learn through more usual means, and often enough they can be wrong.In his book on Swedenborg, who regularly spoke with angels, the psychiatristWilson Van Dusen has a remarkable chapter on “The Presence of Spirits inMadness,” in which he gives accounts of patients communicating with spirits.Some of these turned out to be helpful, guiding voices, but the majority weremalicious troublemakers.8 [index_split_019.html#filepos762798] The fact that TheBook of the Law is written in a style remarkably similar to Crowley’s suggeststhat if it did come from a disembodied intelligence, it was one that knewCrowley’s work and could speak his language; Crowley’s claim that it is unlikeanything he had previously written is unsupportable for anyone familiar with hiswork. And the kind of results Crowley was getting from his magic—in ChanceryLane and in Boleskine—suggests that he was encountering something much morealong the lines of poltergeists than anything particularly “higher.” So it isquite possible that what Rose and Crowley took to be Crowley’s Holy GuardianAngel may have been an entity of a different sort.But if gossipy spirits are too difficult to accept, there are otherpossibilities for what Crowley may have heard in that hotel room in Cairo. InThe Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind, thepsychologist Julian Jaynes writes of the curious phenomenon of auditoryhallucinations, which he believes originate in the right cerebral hemisphere.Jaynes’s radical theory is that ancient man—at least man prior to 1250 BC—didnot have an interior world in the way that we do, and was not, as we are,self-conscious, conscious that we are conscious. “Pre-Homeric man” did not havea “mind space” behind his eyes, Jaynes tells us.9[index_split_019.html#filepos763037] He was not able to “ask himself” what heshould do or carry on an inner monologue as we can (“Hmm, what shall I do today?Wash the car or finish reading Proust?”). Ancient man’s consciousness, Jaynesargues, was “bicameral,” meaning “two-chambered,” the chambers being the rightand left cerebral hemispheres. In us the two sides of the brain work more orless together, although, as split-brain research has shown, under certaincircumstances it becomes clear that we really have two people “inside ourheads.”10 [index_split_019.html#filepos763292] Our “ego” lives in the leftcerebral hemisphere while a few centimeters away is a complete stranger, who werecognize, insofar as we do, as the “unconscious.” In ancient man this split wastotal; what we experience as an inner monologue, ancient man experienced asvoices in his head.11 [index_split_019.html#filepos763527] He believed thatthese voices were the gods, but Jaynes argues they originated in the rightbrain. So when confronted with some difficulty, ancient man did not ask himself“What shall I do?” but waited until his right brain—or the gods—gave himdirections.Whatever we may think of Jaynes’s theory, he provides evidence that suchhallucinations are not as uncommon as we might suppose, and he offers an examplefrom his own experience. Jaynes recounts how, when pondering the question ofknowledge—what it is and how we obtain it—he lay on his couch in despair.“Suddenly, out of an absolute quiet, there came a firm, distinct loud voice frommy upper right which said ‘Include the knower in the known!’” Jaynes was sostartled that he shot up, convinced someone was in the room. “The voice had hadan exact location,” but “No one was there!” Jaynes remarks that “I do not takethis nebulous profundity as divinely inspired, but I do think that it is similarto what was heard by those who have in the past claimed such specialselection.”12 [index_split_019.html#filepos763692] What Jaynes meant was that ifhis hallucination had happened to ancient man—or to a modern mystic—he wouldhave believed he had heard a message from the gods. Jaynes the scientist knowsthat it is merely his right brain, although hearing the phrase “include theknower in the known”—the equivalent of Crowley’s yogic insight about the unionof the seer and the seen—while pondering the question of knowledge should havesuggested to him that this was something more than a “nebulous profundity.”Wilson Van Dusen, also familiar with auditory hallucinations, was convinced theyare not nonsense but a “representation of the person’s state or an answer to hisquery,” that they are, as he says, “self-symbolic” and meaningful.13[index_split_019.html#filepos763818] Of course an auditory hallucination cannotaccount for Rose’s strange behavior or inexplicable familiarity with Egyptianmythology. Some telepathic exchange between Rose and Crowley is possible; we’vealready seen how Crowley had something of the sort with his mother. But the factthat both Jaynes and Crowley describe their voices as having a specificlocation—for Crowley over his left shoulder, for Jaynes over his right—issuggestive.A single auditory hallucination, however, is not the same as an hour of poeticdictation, three days running. But there are several cases of a poet receiving along work all at once. Samuel Taylor Coleridge is said to have had the entirepoem “Kubla Khan” come to him in an opium-inspired dream. When he awoke andbegan to write it down, he was interrupted and all we have is a fragment.Nietzsche, speaking of the composition of his most well-known work, Thus SpokeZarathustra, asks, “Has anyone at the end of the nineteenth century a distinctconception of what poets of strong ages called inspiration? . . . If one had theslightest residue of superstition left in one, one would hardly be able to setaside the idea that one is merely incarnation, merely mouthpiece, merely mediumof overwhelming forces.”14 [index_split_019.html#filepos764218] The poet Rilkeheard the opening lines of his Duino Elegies come to him out of a terrific wind,a very literal example of inspiration.15 [index_split_019.html#filepos764431]These are just some examples of a poetic work coming to its author “out of theblue.”But the main objection to considering The Book of the Law as a sacred text iswhat it says. The central message of The Book of the Law is that a new age hasdawned for mankind, what Crowley calls the aeon of the “crowned and conqueringchild,” which he associates with the Egyptian god Horus. This is a time ofunconstrained personal freedom, at least for a select few. This shouldn’tsurprise us; Crowley’s whole history so far has been centered around his desireto “let me go my own way,” regardless of the consequences. Two previous aeonshave been that of Isis, which is associated with matriarchy, and that of Osiris,the patriarchal age out of which we are supposed to be moving. The age of Isiswas a pagan, nature-oriented time, when mankind felt at one with Mother Earth, atime indeed that many New Age and ecologically oriented people would like to seereturn. In the age of Osiris, this cozy arrangement changed and life became moreserious. Man became aware of death and saw his salvation in terms of sacrifice,suffering, and resurrection. Osiris, like Christ, is a dying god; his descentinto the underworld and rebirth into life was witnessed every day in the descentof the sun into the west and its rebirth in the east. With the age of Horus, weare no longer tied to Mother Earth’s apron strings, nor must we renounce theworld in favor of some otherworldly redemption. We can realize ourselves hereand now as gods, for that is who we really are. The formula for this realizationis thelema, “will,” the word of the new aeon. It is an age of light, life,liberty, and love, as Crowley alliteratively puts it, in which the oldrestrictions and constraints are jettisoned and we are called upon to “do whatwe wilt.” But although Aiwass’s message concerns all of mankind, his view is aselitist as Crowley’s. The vast majority will find the new age catastrophic; onlythe followers of thelema will revel in their new liberty and joy.In The Book of the Law, this tripartite system of ages is mirrored in the threesections of the text, given each day to Crowley, each one associated with thethree central gods of the thelemic pantheon.16[index_split_019.html#filepos764641] There is Nuit, the Egyptian goddess of thenight sky who represents the All; Hadit, a form of Horus, who is theinfinitesimal point, the “complement of Nu” who is “not extended”; andRa-Hoor-Khuit, who is the “crowned and conquering child,” born of the union ofNuit and Hadit. Ra-Hoor-Khuit is himself a version of Horus and is alsoassociated with the god Hoor Paar Kraat, or Harpocrates, the god of silence. TheEgyptian gods have several different aspects and appear in different forms andcombinations, which can get confusing, so it might be best to think of the threeas infinite space, the infinitesimal but infinitely ubiquitous center of thatspace—“God is a circle whose center is everywhere and circumference nowhere”—andthe union of the two producing creative energy or life. Thelemites may disagreewith this reading, but this is how it makes sense to me.There are clear links between Crowley’s ages and the “precession of theequinoxes.” Because of a wobble in the Earth’s axis, every 2,160 years, theconstellation against which the sun rises due east at dawn on the vernal equinoxchanges. Each new constellation gives its name to that age. As we have known forsome time, the next constellation in line is Aquarius. Two previous ages havebeen that of Pisces, which started just before the birth of Christ, and Aries.Pisces is a fish, and one of the symbols of Christ is the fish. Aries is a ramand in the Arian age the ram was a sacrificial animal. Much has been made ofthese stellar shifts. In his book Aion (1951) Jung takes precession seriouslyand tries to work out a kind of “precession of the archetypes.” Crowley’s own“equinox of the gods” does not line up exactly with the shifts in precession.His new age began in 1904, when, as he said, the world was destroyed by fire.Depending on your calculation, the Age of Aquarius began in 2000, or will startin another century or so. But the main difference is that Crowley’s new age isnot one in which “peace will guide the planets and love will steer the stars.”It is one of destruction, chaos, “force and fire.” It will not be characterizedby “harmony and understanding,” but by war; the child is conquering, and as TheBook of the Law says, Horus is a “god of War and of Vengeance.”17[index_split_019.html#filepos764891]Yet another system of ages, which Crowley most certainly knew, is that of thetwelfth-century Calabrian monk Joachim of Fiore (1135–1202). Joachim prophesizeda new age of freedom that was due to arrive in 1260. Joachim saw historyunfolding in three stages: the Age of the Father, characterized by the OldTestament and obedience to the laws of God; the age of the Son, beginning withChrist and carrying on to 1260, when man becomes the Son of God; and the age ofthe Holy Spirit, when mankind would achieve direct contact with God andexperience the spiritual freedom that is the true message of Christianity. Atthis point, the church, its hierarchy and rules, would no longer be necessary,and the true, rather than the literal, meaning of the Gospels would prevail. Asyou might suspect, the church did not much care for Joachim’s forecast, butbreakaway sects like the Brethren of the Free Spirit were inspired by his ideas.Like Joachim of Fiore’s Age of the Holy Spirit, Crowley’s aeon of the “crownedand conquering child” is a time of antinomianism, that is, it is a time when“Abrogate are all rituals, all ordeals, all words and signs.”18[index_split_019.html#filepos765351] All bets are off and we are “beyond goodand evil.”Crowley, or Aiwass, begins The Book of the Law with a phrase that has becomealmost as well known as “Do what thou wilt,” “Every man and every woman is astar.”19 [index_split_019.html#filepos765479] That is to say, every man andevery woman has a peculiar orbit, a trajectory all their own. This is their“true will,” and complications and problems arise only if we move out of ourorbit, or if someone else moves out of theirs and interferes with ours. It is alovely phrase and it may not be coincidental that in 1970 the funk group Sly andthe Family Stone had a number-one hit with the song “Everybody Is a Star.” Bythat time Crowley was well-known in the counterculture, and the idea chimed inwell with “doing your own thing,” a catchphrase that itself has its origins inthe Upanishads, which counsel us to do our own work, however humble, rather thanthat of another, however grand. The lyric “Everybody is a star / One big circlegoing round and round” suggests Crowley’s idea that we each have a personalorbit. It does not take much to see in this an argument for being left alone andnot interfered with.But another aspect to the “orbit” idea is that we have no will but to follow it;stars cannot change their mind. Aiwass’s counsel that “Thou hast no right but todo thy will” suggests that we must do our will, that is, must keep to ourorbits, which have been calculated for us ages before we were born.20[index_split_019.html#filepos765606] At least most of us must, as Crowleyhimself seemed able to shift what his will was depending on circumstances.Earlier I suggested that for all his talk of freedom and release fromrestrictions, there is a curious authoritarian sense to Crowley’s idea ofthelema, which, keeping in mind the notion that we are stars with a uniqueorbit, is highly dubious. There is a Taoist sense to his idea of will; it haslittle to do with striving and struggle, with the kind of will that I wasattracted to in Nietzsche, which has to do with effort and discipline. Crowley’s“will” is better translated as “way” in the Taoist sense. Crowley himself felt agreat affinity with Taoism; he translated the Tao Te Ching, and Simon Iff, hismystical detective—Crowley’s fictionalized image of himself in old age—is aTaoist sleuth. There is no striving or struggle in Taoism; one takes the path ofleast resistance. One is in tune with the cosmos and a part of it. It is goingout of one’s “way” that creates problems. This is why at the beginning of Magickin Theory and Practice Crowley wants to help “the Banker, the Pugilist, theBiologist, the Poet, the Navvy, the Grocer, the Factory Girl, theMathematician . . . fulfill themselves perfectly, each in his or her own properfunction.” For “function” read “orbit” and we have these cardboard figures as“stars.” There is a curious sense of predestination to Crowley’s idea of will,and predestination was a central tenet of the Plymouth Brethren; Crowley, infact, says that they held “predestination as rigidly as Calvin, yet this nowiseinterfered with complete free will,” a logical incompatibility that Crowleyhimself tries to accommodate and that, to my mind, ends in muddle.21[index_split_019.html#filepos765734] In any case, in Aiwass’s new age, therewill be many who must stick to their orbits—“The slaves shall serve”—but therewill be a few who are allowed more leeway.22[index_split_019.html#filepos765888]And leeway is certainly what they want—or at least what Aiwass has to offer.“The word of Sin is Restriction,” Aiwass told Crowley, a conclusion Crowley hadreached long before.23 [index_split_019.html#filepos766048] “Enough of Because!Be he damned for a dog,”: this was an injunction that suited Crowley’sunreflective character nicely.24 [index_split_019.html#filepos766176] “For purewill, unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of result, is every wayperfect”: in other words, “Just do it,” something Crowley must have communicatedto Rose to clinch their marriage.25 [index_split_019.html#filepos766305] Otheraspects of Crowley’s personality are equally accommodated. For one thing, Aiwassseems as keen on alliteration as Crowley: “Veil not your vices in virtuouswords.”26 [index_split_019.html#filepos766553] This is said in criticism of the“modest woman,” whose “veil of sorrow” must be rent to allow for the newdispensation of the Scarlet Woman who shall be “loud and adulterous,” and“shameless before all men,” and whose “eyes shall burn with desire as she standsbare and rejoicing,” all of which sounds like the sort of thing Crowley liked ina woman—we remember the Mexican prostitute whose “evil inscrutable eyes”promised a “whirlpool of seductive sin.”27 [index_split_019.html#filepos766714]And the command to “take your fill and will of love as ye will, when, where, andwith whom ye will,” is something Crowley did not need to be told twice.28[index_split_019.html#filepos766850] The Scarlet Woman is not alone; the GreatBeast, the other favorite biblical character of Crowley’s youth, plays a centralrole in the new aeon, too; a peculiar one, in that Crowley is the Great Beast—noone else can be—but the Scarlet Woman is an “office,” that many woman can anddid occupy, in order to “work the work of wickedness,” a project Crowley beganat the age of eleven. Even Crowley’s taste for Swinburne shows through: “Hearme, ye people of sighing / The sorrows of pain and regret / Are left to the deadand the dying / The folk that not know me as yet,” scans much as Swinburne’s“Could you hurt me, sweet lips, though I hurt you? /Men touch them and change ina trice / The lilies and languors of virtue / For the raptures and roses ofvice” from Swinburne’s masochistic ode to “Our Lady of Pain.”29[index_split_019.html#filepos766978] Aiwass also seems quite fond of theDecadent School Crowley was introduced to by his lover Pollitt: “I am theblue-lidded daughter of Sunset; I am the naked brilliance of the voluptuousnight-sky. To me! To me!”30 [index_split_019.html#filepos767231] This would notbe out of place in the famous Yellow Book, the literary magazine of the 1890sthat made Pollitt’s friend Aubrey Beardsley famous. Crowley’s incipientauthoritarianism comes through in the Social Darwinism Aiwass prescribes inpastiche Nietzscheanisms such as “Let my servants be few & secret: they shallrule the many & the known”; “These are dead, these fellows; they feel not. Weare not for the poor and sad”; “We have nothing with the outcast and the unfit;let them die in their misery”; “Compassion is the vice of kings; stamp down thewretched & the weak.”31 [index_split_019.html#filepos767386]It is not impossible that a discarnate intelligence communicated a vision of anew aeon whose characteristics suited Crowley to a tee, but if it did, it wasawfully convenient for Crowley. It is also odd that Aiwass should choose “Dowhat thou wilt” and thelema as his battle cries; both show a curious familiaritywith Western literature. Thélème is the name of the abbey in Rabelais’sGargantuan; above its door is inscribed “Fay ce que vouldras,” or “Do what youwill.” In “The Everlasting Gospel” Blake writes “Do what you will / This world’sa fiction / And is made up of contradiction.” Even Saint Augustine counsels usto “Love, and do what you will,” in the seventh homily on the First Epistle ofJohn. And Aiwass can be clearly wrong about some things, although Crowley had tofollow his advice in order to find out. “To worship me take wine and strangedrugs whereof I will tell my prophet, & be drunk thereof! They shall not harm yeat all.”32 [index_split_019.html#filepos767525] Crowley took this advice anddied a heroin addict.Crowley claimed that The Book of the Law contained proof of its ownauthenticity, but such claims will be accepted only by believers and require aknowledge and expertise of Kabbalah and other arcane hermeneutic disciplinesmost of us do not possess or have the time or inclination to acquire. Mostreaders will accept or reject Crowley’s new aeon based on what they read in thetext. The strongest argument against The Book of the Law as an “utterance of anilluminated mind co-extensive with the ultimate ideas of which the universe iscomposed” is that it is too preoccupied with Crowley’s adolescent rebellionagainst his Plymouth Brethren upbringing.33 [index_split_019.html#filepos767654]Crowley protested that he was a reluctant Messiah and that he was “bitterlyopposed to the principles of the Book on almost every point of morality,” butgiven that the morality expressed is very much the one he was already living, itis difficult to take his protestations seriously.34[index_split_019.html#filepos767809] Colin Wilson is surely right when heremarks that when Crowley claims that “the emancipation of mankind from alllimitations whatever is one of the main precepts of the book,” he really means“emancipation from the Victorian limitations that made my childhood somiserable.”35 [index_split_019.html#filepos767936] This itself is a limitationCrowley never outgrew. With a kind of autistic persistence, he carried throughhis project of committing the “unforgivable sin” well beyond the age when mostof us move past such concerns and direct our energies to making something out oflife. “Bind nothing! Let there be no difference made among you between any onething & any other; for thereby cometh hurt” is the outlook of a child, for onlya child believes that being “emancipated from all limitations” is an unqualifiedgood.36 [index_split_019.html#filepos768130] If Aiwass was a discarnateintelligence, he was a singularly immature one.To my reading, the essence of The Book of the Law is a philosophy that can befound in other, equally dubious prophets, from the Marquis de Sade, to theradical Freudian Otto Gross, to the “transgressive” French writer GeorgesBataille and rock figures like Jim Morrison and Iggy Pop, to name a few.37[index_split_019.html#filepos768281] This is the “liberationist” philosophy Imention in the introduction. It is the “default setting” for an approach to lifethat rejects the need for limits and discipline—associated with the “straight”“conventional” world—and wants, as the late historian Jacques Barzun phrased it,a “wholly unconditional life,” which is another way of saying an antinomianone.38 [index_split_019.html#filepos770043] In Turn Off Your Mind I borrow fromthe German novelist Hermann Hesse the term “Russian Man,” which he used in abook about Dostoyevsky, In Sight of Chaos (1922). Russian Man, Hesse writes, isthe outcome of a “primeval, occult, Asiatic ideal,” a “turning away from everyfixed morality and ethic.”39 [index_split_019.html#filepos770263] InDostoyevsky’s Karamazov brothers, Hesse sees an amorality that doesn’tdistinguish between right and wrong, good or bad. For Russian Man, good and bad,right and wrong, God and Devil are one, just as they are for Crowley. RussianMan embraces the dictum of the Old Man of the Mountain, the leader of the deadlyhashishin, that “nothing is true, everything is permitted.” In Turn Off YourMind I write “Russian Man is a hysteric, a drunkard, a criminal, a poet, a holyman. He is murderer and judge, thug and gentleman, egomaniac and saint.”40[index_split_019.html#filepos770447] Hesse calls him “the unpredictable man ofthe future,” who sees “every law as a convention,” regards “every upright man asa philistine,” and overrates “every freedom and eccentricity.” He can as easilybecome a criminal as an ascetic, and believes in nothing “except the insaneuncertainty of every belief.”41 [index_split_019.html#filepos770610] Hessehimself knew these dangers because he himself embraced much of the creed ofRussian Man, believing that out of this chaos something new and creative mightcome. But unlike Crowley, he was reflective enough to recognize that theliberation Russian Man promises is not an unalloyed good. In his Tagebuch for1920–21, Hesse wrote:> I can’t really say whether I, with my attempt to find freedom and my immersion> in chaos, am not just as dangerous, just as destructive as the patriots and> the retroverts. I demand of myself that I go back beyond the pairs of> opposites and accept chaos.42 [index_split_019.html#filepos770769] Hesse, too, knew of the Abyss, but unlike Crowley he did not want to plunge intoit headfirst. Russian Man is a kind of poster boy for the “liberating” 1960s,for sex, drugs, and rock and roll, and one of the agents of this liberation wasCrowley. “But exceed! exceed! Strive ever to more! and if thou art trulymine—and doubt it not, and if thou art ever joyous!—death is the crown ofall.”43 [index_split_019.html#filepos771003] Crowley did exceed; his cult, weknow, was of “excess in all directions,” an ethos that characterized the sixtiesas well as several other antinomian times, those of the Beats, the Surrealists,the punks. Crowley did not need Aiwass or anyone else to tell him this, but forCrowley it was not enough that he himself had an insatiable hunger for excess,regardless of the consequences; it had to be a law of the universe, and in morelocal terms, demand the end of civilization as we know it.—FOLLOWING HIS REVELATION Crowley had a local painter make a copy of what hecalled the “Stele of Revealing.” He also had the assistant curator of the CairoMuseum translate the words of Exhibit No. 666, written some centuries ago by thepriest Ankh-F-N-Khonsu, who, oddly enough, Crowley would later recognize ashimself in an earlier incarnation. These, and the manuscript of The Book of theLaw, were placed in his luggage and Crowley prepared to return to Europe. Interms of his magical advancement Crowley had, he believed, passed through themystical “glass ceiling.” He had gained admittance to the inner circle of trueadepts, and moved that much closer to the Abyss. He bestowed upon himself themagical grade of Adeptus Major 60 = 5empty square [images/00005.jpg], taking thename Ol Sonuf Vaoresagi, meaning “I reign over thee” in Enochian, the languageof the angels developed by the Elizabethan magician John Dee, with which Crowleyexperimented during his time in Mexico. Although by now the Golden Dawn hadsplintered into different groups, and Crowley had always felt he was much moreadvanced than any of them, he continued to climb the magical totem pole, ratheras if he had been kicked out of the Boy Scouts but was nevertheless determinedto win his merit badges. He would continue this for the rest of his life,although, as Israel Regardie remarks, “there is absolutely no clue in any of[Crowley’s] writings as to the authorization for these promotions, save for hisown realization that he had satisfactorily completed the work prescribed forthat grade.”44 [index_split_019.html#filepos771159] In other words, Crowleybecame initiate and initiator in one and there is no objective measure forwhether or not he warranted his advancement. Following the revelation in Cairo,Prince and Princess Chioa Khan headed back to Paris, where Crowley’s first stepas an emissary of the Secret Chiefs was to declare war on Mathers. He wrote hisold master a letter informing him that he was now the visible head of the orderand letting him know about thelema. He did not expect a reply. After a lunchwith the novelist Arnold Bennett—who noted that Crowley wore the largest ringBennett had ever seen—Crowley and Rose returned to Boleskine.Mathers replied to Crowley’s declaration of war, Crowley believed, by launchinghis own magical attack, plaguing him with Abramelin demons. Crowley’sbloodhounds died. A servant went berserk and attacked the pregnant Rose. Crowleyforced the madman into the cellar at the end of a salmon gaff, until the policetook him away. Crowley then sent his own Abramelin minions on the offensive.After the demon Beelzebub retaliated, Mathers’s attack ended. Crowley alsocontinued his attack on the literary world. In 1904 Crowley founded his ownpublishing company, typically calling it the Society for the Propagation ofReligious Truth, a joke on the Church of England’s Society for the Promotion ofChristian Knowledge. He had been publishing his poetry for the last six years,but little of it had sold; Jephthah, his bestseller, had managed ten copies.Undeterred, Crowley conceived the idea of producing his Collected Works, whichrequired three volumes. But an even more eventful production was Rose’s givingbirth to a baby girl on July 28. Crowley unforgivingly christened her Nuit MaAhathoor Hecate Sappho Jezebel Lilith.Her initial appearance must have touched him, for we do get a glimpse of a morehuman Crowley, beaming as a proud father. The fact that neither Crowley nor Rosewere well equipped to be parents did not come to mind; although he did detectsigns that his union with Rose was not as perfect as he had believed; after thepregnancy, she did not, he believed, settle down “into the normal course of herphysiological life.”45 [index_split_019.html#filepos771330] But for the momenthe was happy.His promotion to being the word of the aeon did not prevent Crowley fromcarrying on his usual routine; in fact he tells us that he practically forgotabout the revelation in Cairo. Visitors came to Boleskine and the Crowleysentertained. One was Dr. J. Jacot Guillarmod, whom Crowley had last seen atChogo Ri and who arrived in the spring of 1905. Crowley was addicted topractical jokes; he had already put up curious signs around Boleskine reading“This way to the Kooloomooloomavlock” and informing readers that this fantasticcreature “does not bite.” Guillarmod was eager to do some shooting, and toappease him, Crowley told him about a rare breed of wild sheep, the haggis,which, Crowley said, just might make an appearance. Haggis is really a kind ofstew made of a sheep’s heart, liver, and lungs, but the Swiss Guillarmod didn’tknow this. Crowley had connived with his servant to arrange for a tame sheep—hisneighbor’s prize ram—to play the part of the haggis. Crowley and Guillarmod wereplaying billiards when the servant burst in and cried, “There’s a haggis on thehill.” Instantly Crowley grabbed a rifle and handed one to Guillarmod. Theyheaded out into a torrent but Guillarmod’s hunting blood was up and they crawledthrough the wet heather. There was a thick fog but through it Guillarmod couldsee the rare beast. He raised his rifle and blew away the prize ram. Guillarmodlater had the head mounted at his home in Neufchâtel, inscribed with a plaqueinforming his guests of his rare catch, and repeated the story often. Crowleywould go to great lengths to pull someone’s leg.Guillarmod was there for more serious business, too. He wanted another crack atthe Himalayas. This time it was Kangchenjunga, the world’s third-highestmountain, which had yet to be scaled. At 28,169 feet it is just short of K2.This would be Crowley’s last chance to establish his reputation as a seriousclimber. He agreed to Guillarmod’s idea, with one caveat: he, and no one else,would lead the expedition. Guillarmod agreed and left for Switzerland with hishaggis, entrusted to find more members for the party. When Eckenstein and GuyKnowles heard that Crowley would be leader, both declined to join; neitherwished to put their lives in his hands. Crowley himself must have had someinkling of what lay ahead. He made out a will, requesting that he be buried inhis Golden Dawn robes, with a crown and wand and other magical accoutrements, ina sealed vault, with vellum editions of his books, much like the fabledChristian Rosenkreutz. As with Chogo Ri, problems beset the expedition early on.Crowley was unflappably optimistic, but Guillarmod thought the route he chosewouldn’t work. According to Guillarmod, it was Crowley’s blindness, and hismistreatment of the porters, that led to the expedition’s disaster.Crowley arrived in Bombay on June 9, 1905; by the twelfth he was in Darjeeling.On the thirty-first Guillarmod arrived with two other men, Alexis Pache andCharles Reymond, both experienced Alpine climbers. Crowley himself had invited afifth man to join the expedition. The Italian Alcesti C. Rigo de Righi had neverset foot on a mountain, but he managed the Drum Druid Hotel, where Crowley wasstaying. Crowley’s reason for including Righi was that he understood Hindustaniand Tibetan and could help with the porters, but there is some suggestion thatRighi asked to be involved and agreed to waive Crowley’s hotel bill in exchange.After marching through leech-infested valleys in what seemed like a perpetualtorrent, on August 22 the party arrived at the southwest face of what onemountaineer called the most dangerous mountain in the world.46[index_split_019.html#filepos771485] Unlike Everest and K2, Kangchenjunga isexposed, not guarded by satellite peaks; because of this it is prone to hugeavalanches; vast sheets of ice and snow flow down its sides at great speed. LikeEverest and K2, it was not scaled until the 1950s; again Crowley’s expeditionwas without the benefit of modern equipment and we must acknowledge theircourage, even if, as some authorities suggest, Crowley’s optimism wasunwarranted. Here at the Yalung Glacier, Crowley and company looked at the giantbefore them. Crowley felt in top form and was convinced there was “not one darkspot on the horizon.”47 [index_split_019.html#filepos771639] A few days laterthe troubles started.Guillarmod was unhappy with Crowley’s treatment of the porters. Crowley hadn’tprovided them with suitable footwear and expected them to march barefoot acrossthe glacier, although Crowley insisted that the porters had suitable bootshidden away and simply preferred to preserve them. Guillarmod was also unhappywith the steps Crowley had cut into the ice and felt sure they wouldn’t besecure. Two days later he was proved correct when a porter slipped on one andfell to his death. The god of the Five Great Peaks—the meaning of “Kang ChenJunga”—required a sacrifice, some of the porters believed, and had taken it.Crowley’s man Righi—a “low class Italian”—was having trouble with the porters,too, and Crowley infers that he went insane, a situation, we recall, that alsooccurred on Chogo Ri.48 [index_split_019.html#filepos771794] By August 31several porters complained to Guillarmod that they were tired of the BurraSahib, or “Great Lord”—Crowley—beating them, and by this time many of theporters had already deserted the expedition. Crowley admitted to beating oneman, for his own good and that of the expedition, but we remember his insistenceon establishing his “moral superiority” at Chogo Ri, so we must take hisprotestations with ample salt. Guillarmod was also unhappy with Crowley’s routeof ascent, which to him seemed hopelessly optimistic.Biographers differ over the foolishness or not of Crowley’s choice; more than acentury later it is doubtful if we will ever know one way or the other. Theupshot was that after repeated complaints of beatings and continued desertionsby the porters, Righi and Guillarmod decided that Crowley should no longer leadthe expedition. Crowley believed Guillarmod had taken leave of his senses andresented being led by an Englishman. After confronting Crowley, Guillarmod andRighi decided to take their group to a lower camp; there was no room for them tosleep at Crowley’s and, in any case, they most likely did not want to spend thenight in his vicinity. Alexis Pache, who Crowley said he came to like very much,decided to join them; he had been sleeping without a bed the last few nightsbecause his porter refused to bring it to the Burra Sahib’s camp, fearful of histemper. Pache, too, probably wanted to distance himself from Crowley. The BurraSahib warned the “rebels” that if they left his camp that night, they would bedead men. He told Pache specifically that Guillarmod was a “dangerous imbecileon mountains” and had now become a “dangerous maniac.”49[index_split_019.html#filepos771926] But if so, why did Crowley agree to climbthe most dangerous mountain in the world with him?Perhaps the god of the Five Great Peaks required more than one sacrifice. Orperhaps Crowley was correct and the “rebels” had gotten into trouble because oftheir insubordination. Whatever the reason, soon after starting their descent,Guillarmod, Righi, Pache, and their three ill-shod porters were in difficulty.All were roped together and when a porter slipped off the narrow track, hepulled down the man behind him. They in turn pulled the other porter and Pache.Righi and Guillarmod tried to hold them, but as they struggled, the snow slippedfrom around their feet and precipitated one of the deadly avalanches for whichKangchenjunga is known. Guillarmod and Righi were swept away, their comrade andthe porters beneath them buried in snow and debris. Guillarmod managed to climbout and reach Righi, and the two tried to get to the others. They shouted forhelp and Reymond, who had remained with Crowley, went to see what had happened.He expected Crowley to join him, but Crowley had “no indication why they wereyelling” and stayed behind.50 [index_split_019.html#filepos772053] Crowleyclaims Reymond said he would call him if he needed help. When Reymond didn’tcall—so Crowley says—he slept the sleep of the righteous. Crowley claimed helater looked at the scene of the disaster, and assessed it as an “absolutelytrivial avalanche.”51 [index_split_019.html#filepos772174] As far as he wasconcerned, it was only Guillarmod’s idiocy that had led four men to theirdeaths. Guillarmod’s own account has Crowley leaving his camp the next morningand making his way down the mountain at a distance from the others.52[index_split_019.html#filepos772295] According to Guillarmod, he did not look tosee if his companions were alive or dead but simply deserted the expedition.The accident was not Crowley’s fault, and he may have had every right to say “Itold you so.” But this does not justify his failure to come to his companions’aid. It is blatantly disingenuous to predict a catastrophe and then claim not toknow why the people whose deaths you had just foreseen were calling for help.Symonds remarks that as Crowley made his way down the mountain he heard voices.They were so clear that, like Julian Jaynes, Crowley called out, “Who is there?”He heard them again and “began to think myself the prey of anhallucination”—perhaps like the one he had experienced some months earlier inCairo?53 [index_split_019.html#filepos772586] Nevertheless, the voices did notprevent him from writing self-justifying articles for an Indian newspaper,cabling a questionable account of the expedition to London’s Daily Mail, andwithdrawing all of the expedition’s funds from a Darjeeling bank. Crowley toldhis Indian readers that he was “not overanxious in the circumstances to renderhelp,” having “no sympathy” for a mountain “accident” of the sort. One wouldthink one article would be sufficient to clarify matters, but it took five forCrowley to set the record straight, which suggests something less than aguiltless conscience—possibly an eye to profit from the tragedy.54[index_split_019.html#filepos772707] Even if Guillarmod was a fool and Crowleywas right, leaving the “rebels” to their fate was one of the worst decisionsCrowley ever made. Crowley might have saved something of his reputation if hehad hurried to the scene at daybreak and helped do what he could. But surely asuperman like Crowley should have leapt up at the first shout and put his backinto digging out the others. Most likely it would have been futile but Crowleywould have shown that he would do the right thing when necessary, even forfools. Instead he acted spitefully. Crowley was simply unable to do something hedidn’t want to, especially if he believed a fool would be taught a lesson in theprocess. Kangchenjung was the end of his mountaineering career. It haunted himfor the rest of his life. After it, he really was the wanderer of the waste.Crowley was so troubled by his friend Pache’s death that he took solace in aNepalese girl who predictably inspired him to song. “O kissable Tarshitering! /The wild bird calls its mate—and I” should give the reader some idea of hisstate of mind. He also went big-game hunting in Calcutta, a guest of theMaharajah of Moharbhanj. It was around this time that Crowley wrote the letterto Gerald Kelly, spelling out his need for “strong” stimulants. He was attractedto magic again and began paying astral visits to Elaine Simpson (Witkowski); heimplies they made astral love, an erotic practice his older contemporary, theSwedish playwright August Strindberg, found rather less delightful.55[index_split_019.html#filepos773260] A need to devote his life to spiritualpurity possessed him, and to express this, Crowley again took to writingpornography, this time of a homosexual bent. He studied Persian and produced TheScented Garden of Abdullah the Satirist of Shiraz (also known as theBagh-I-Muattar), which Crowley claimed was a translation of a series ofseventeenth-century ghazals (rhyming couplets and refrains) of a Sufi poet,Abdullah al Haji. It is, as one critic expresses it, a work of “decorousobscenity,” a kind of “anal ‘Song of Solomon.’”56[index_split_019.html#filepos773670] Crowley may have found his real poeticmétier in this robustly perfumed celebration of sodomy, but it remains, by thatvery fact, for restricted tastes.Crowley’s need for strong experience was fulfilled one night in Calcutta when hefound himself in the Culinga Bazaar during the feast of the Durga Puja. Leavingthe main bazaar, he entered what seemed like a labyrinth of narrow streets. Hisjungle senses were sharp and the feeling that he was being followed wasjustified: out of the darkness six men in white robes appeared. Suddenly theygrabbed him. Crowley was pressed against a wall, and hands riffled his pockets.He had the presence of mind to grab his Webley revolver and let loose a barrage.Two men fell and the others scattered. An angry crowd gathered and Crowley knewhe had to move quickly. His practice in Mexico served him admirably and Crowleyonce again became invisible. He made his way back to his hotel and the nextmorning he visited a friend, Edward Thornton, with whom he had rowed on theIrrawaddy en route to visit Allan Bennett some years earlier. Thornton advisedhim to lay low. The next day the Calcutta Standard carried an article about theshooting; the police were offering a reward for any information about theEuropean believed responsible. If Crowley had made himself invisible, my guessis he pulled it off because the threat of death—his assailants flashed aknife—or arrest forced him to make a greater effort than he had before, and thesheer concentration allowed him to move silently through the frenzied crowds.Or, perhaps equally as unlikely, the Secret Chiefs came to his rescue.It was like Crowley to greet his wife and child with the remark that they hadarrived just in time to see him hanged. A day after the incident, Rose and theirdaughter landed in Calcutta. Not enough that they had just traveled from grayBoleskine to India’s distant shores, now they had to move on again, this timewith a fugitive. Although Crowley had been studying Persian, Rose was tired ofOmar Khayyam—he was all the rage back in Britain—and so, anything to please thewife, he decided they should go to China. The prospect of smoking opium clinchedit.The idea was to head for Rangoon to visit Bennett, whose monastery was nearby.Remembering the journey, in the Confessions Crowley remarks that he “wantseverything that the world holds” and that he would “go to prison or the scaffoldfor the sake of the experience.”57 [index_split_019.html#filepos773845] Giventhat he had just run away from these two “delicious horrors,” one suspects thathis appetite was a tad less indiscriminate than he suggests. In Rangoon he leftRose and child in a hotel while he met with Bennett at his monastery. Crowleydisagreed with Bennett about karma, holding that one’s progress depended onone’s own efforts, not grace, chance, or the actions of a previous life; yet aswe’ve seen, his own notion of a “true will” is equally limiting. But Crowley wassufficiently impressed to take the idea of acquiring a Magical Memory,recollections of one’s past lives, seriously. This was a challenge Crowley tookup in later life and that he expressed in Liber Thisharb (“Berashith,” or“creation,” backward), a text in how to review one’s life in reverse.58[index_split_019.html#filepos774000] Yet, paradoxically enough, Crowley’s mindwas “hot on the trail of the future,” and the family soon found themselvesheading up the Irrawaddy to Mandalay.59 [index_split_019.html#filepos774174]At Bhamo they were held up by official red tape but after weeks of waiting fortheir passports, the Crowleys finally entered China, or rather made their wayalong the China/Burma border. He had been warned about the dangers of taking awoman, let alone a child, into these parts, but Crowley counted on anEnglishman’s first line of defense—acting like a gentleman—to see them through.(This was the time of the Boxer Rebellion.) And although there were physicaldangers aplenty, Crowley decided to use the trek in order to confront perils ofa more spiritual kind. It was time, he believed, to cross the Abyss.Crowley’s chapters in the Confessions about his “walk across China” are filledwith sufficient local color and detail to make a readable and informativetravelogue, marred only by his racist remarks and frequent need to exert his“moral superiority.” Crowley’s determination to show his porters who was bossled to increasing friction. On one occasion his Chinese interpreter rode off onCrowley’s pony, which was much better than his own horse. Crowley does not tellus what prompted this “theft” but we can imagine how Crowley’s “moralsuperiority” might affect his moral “inferiors.” Crowley pulled this particularinferior into a thorn bush and as the rest of the coolies marched past, Crowleystruck him with his whip. Later, at Manhao, where Crowley was supposed to paythe coolies, he devised a plan to “get his own back.” When Rose and the childwere safely on the boat, Crowley paid the head man, deducting a considerable sumas a fine. As the coolies became enraged, Crowley ordered the boatman to castoff, pointing his rifle at him as an incentive. The coolies shouted as theirmoral superior moved downstream, pleased with showing his inferiors their placeby docking their pay.But these incidents were nothing compared to the struggle going on withinCrowley’s soul. His real aim in this apparently pointless and dangerousexcursion was to answer such questions as “Who am I?” and “What is my purpose inexistence?”—queries he believed he could not pursue in less demandingcircumstances. Crowley said that these months—from November 1905 to February1906—were the most important period of his life, “so far as my personal attitudetoward myself and the universe was concerned.” If so, he began it by realizinghe was insane. He saw everything as disconnected, unintelligible, meaningless.He wrote in his diary for November 19, “I realize in myself the perfectimpossibility of reason . . . I wish to go from A to B; and I am not only acripple, but there is no such thing as space. I have to keep an appointment atmidnight, and not only has my watch stopped, but there is no such thing astime.”60 [index_split_019.html#filepos774329] Crowley concludes that from thedate of this entry until the beginning of February the following year, he was“intellectually insane.”61 [index_split_019.html#filepos774456] Of course thisput his wife and baby daughter in danger, but what could he do? He was facingthe Abyss.Crowley had arrived at a conclusion that the philosopher Immanuel Kant hadreached more than a century earlier in his classic The Critique of Pure Reason:that reason can be used to support antithetical arguments, and is of little usein grappling with the central mysteries of existence. Yet Crowley’s sense of the“perfect impossibility of reason” was as much rooted in his aimless, dizzyinglife as it was in his metaphysical ponderings. He had been rushing across theplanet for the last four years, plunging in and out of poetry, magic, Buddhism,mountaineering, sex, pornography, drugs, marriage, and much else impulsively,burning up a fortune in the process. He himself admitted that his mind was “themost infernally active on the globe,” which is another way of saying that hecouldn’t keep it fixed on one thing—the lesson that Eckenstein and Allan Bennetttried to teach him.62 [index_split_019.html#filepos774578] It is not surprisingthat, as the steamship took him and his family up the Irrawaddy, he saw theriver and everything around him as a jumble of “disconnected phenomena.”63[index_split_019.html#filepos774705] The most disconnected phenomenon washimself.Crowley saw his insanity as a stage in the process of making contact with hisHoly Guardian Angel. Crowley decided that he would continue the Abramelinoperation there and then, on horseback in some remote part of Asia. He had toquell the reasoning intellect in order to allow the higher mind to communicatewith him; in Kabbalah this is called the Neschamah. Crowley was faced with thequestion of how he was to do this. Everything he needed to work the Abramelinmagic was back in Boleskine. Crowley reflected that he had two choices. He couldtravel in his astral body back to Boleskine and perform the operation there; hehad already made several astral visits to Elaine Simpson and so had sufficientpractice in projecting his consciousness out of his body. Or he could create animaginal temple—not an imaginary one—in his mind.64[index_split_019.html#filepos774832] This is one of Crowley’s great magicalsuccesses and reminds us that for all his flaws as a human being, Crowley tookmagic seriously and was actually very good at it. Using Mathers’s Goetia and“The Bornless Ritual” devised by Bennett (based on an ancient Egyptian text),Crowley visualized his temple inwardly and invoked what he called the Augoeides,or “body of light,” crying out his invocations in the Asian wilderness.Augoeides is a Greek term meaning the “dawn light.” It was used by theneo-Platonic philosopher-magician Iamblichus and also by Madame Blavatsky. It isunderstood in different ways, but in a general sense we can think of it as a“higher self.”Crowley’s Golden Dawn training in visualization, as well as the exercisesEckenstein gave him, helped him to employ what the Renaissance Hermeticistscalled “the art of memory,” a method of vividly visualizing an entire “inner”environment, that is as “real” as an outer one.65[index_split_019.html#filepos775417] On a less elevated plane, Crowley’s abilityto play three games of chess simultaneously while blindfolded also helped.66[index_split_019.html#filepos775639] Crowley believed he was successful and thaton that trek across China—somewhere between Tengyueh and Talifu—he had crossedthe Abyss and achieved the Knowledge and Conversation of his Holy GuardianAngel. In magical circles there is some controversy about this, as there isabout whether or not Aiwass should be identified with Crowley’s H.G.A.; Crowleyhimself was unsure about this. One Abyss he certainly did enter was when hispony threw him over a forty-foot cliff. This served as a kind of shock, what hiscontemporary Gurdjieff would have called an “alarm clock.” The fall couldhave—should have—killed him. Why was he spared? Crowley faced the question thatconfronted him ever since Cambridge, when he flirted with becoming an ambassadoror chess champion: what should I do with myself? His inability to answer thiscaused a kind of psychic breakdown, and Crowley went through a patch ofdissociation, which he, however, took as a newfound freedom.“The effect of my ordeal,” he said, “had been to remove all forces soever whichhad impinged on my normal direction.” Invoking Isaac Newton, Crowley felt thathis “star had been diverted from its proper orbit by . . . the attraction ofother heavenly bodies. Their influence had been removed. For the first time inmy life I was really free. I had no personality left. . . . I found myself inthe middle of China [actually somewhere on its border with Burma] with a wifeand child. I was no longer influenced by love for them, no longer interested inprotecting them as I had been; but there was a man, Aleister Crowley, husbandand father . . . and it was his business to give them his undivided love, careand protection.”67 [index_split_019.html#filepos775794] Crowley was no longerCrowley the man, but Crowley the Babe in the Abyss. For him, Crowley the manwith a wife and child was but one more phenomenon. But if he was no longer the“man, Aleister Crowley,” and was no longer interested in protecting his family,what was he? Crowley arrived at the conclusion that he existed in the world forone purpose: to teach his fellow men how to contact their own Holy GuardianAngels, or, as he would more pithily put it, to discover their “true wills.”—BY MARCH 1906 the walk across China was over. Crowley’s first step in his newcareer was to separate from Rose and his daughter. At Hanoi they boarded a shipfor Hong Kong. He had thought of sailing down the Yang-tse, but was now inspiredwith the idea of making another assault on Kangchenjunga. At Hong Kong heexplained to Rose that she and Nuit would travel home via India (she was toretrieve their luggage in Calcutta), while he would go the opposite route andreach Boleskine via New York, where he would drum up support for his newexpedition. In the Confessions Crowley casually says that “we decided that Roseshould return” via India, but it’s doubtful that Rose had much say in thematter. What Rose also didn’t know was that Crowley intended to visit ElaineSimpson, who now lived in Shanghai. He spent several days with her performingmagic and smoking opium. Elaine served as his seeress and he told her aboutAiwass and The Book of the Law. He was still a halfhearted Buddhist and Aiwass’sinsistence that existence was pure joy—“leaping laughter and deliciouslanguor”—grated on his perception of existence as sorrow. But the reluctantMessiah was encouraged in his new work by Soror Semper Fidelis, although herencouragement did not go as far as to sleep with him. Aiwass, not happy aboutthis, told Crowley he should break with her but also sleep with her. Yet whenAiwass realized that Elaine would remain faithful to her husband, he toldCrowley to move on. Reluctantly he did. He crossed the Pacific to Vancouver,where he boarded a train to New York. From there he crossed the Atlantic toEngland. When he arrived in Liverpool, he received the news that Nuit MaAhathoor Hecate Sappho Jezebel Lilith had died of typhus in Rangoon. The manCrowley would no longer have to protect his baby girl. The fact that he hadabandoned her and her mother in Hong Kong, of course, had nothing to do with herdeath. It was, he determined, Rose’s fault. He had already recognized hergrowing alcoholism and most likely in a drunken stupor Rose had failed to cleanthe nipple of Nuit’s bottle and it had become infected. The man Crowley wasstricken by the news. But there was one less pull on his star’s orbit and now hecould move that much more freely into the void."},{"pageContent":"FIVETOWARD THE SILVER STAR> [images/00004.jpg] For Crowley, 1906 was not a good year. His daughter had died, his wife, hediscovered, was an alcoholic, and he himself suffered bad health. An infectedgland in his groin required an operation, as did his right eye, which had pickedup a chill. Neuralgia and migraines plagued him, and an ulcerated throat laidhim up for months. His daughter’s death grieved him—his ill health may have beena psychosomatic response to repressed feelings of guilt—but he found solace inthe belief that it was a sign that he had failed to accept the responsibilitygiven him by the Secret Chiefs. Although he had mislaid the manuscript of TheBook of the Law and was lax in fulfilling its commands, he nevertheless accusedRose of failing in her duties as the Scarlet Woman. To a reader of The Book ofthe Law this is nonsense. Crowley blamed her for not taking her maternalresponsibilities seriously, but a mother is the last thing we would expect aScarlet Woman to be. Aiwass warned that if “pity and compassion and tenderness”visit the heart of the Scarlet Woman, then his “vengeance shall be known.” Hewill “slay me her child.” But if she works “the work of wickedness,” is “loudand adulterous” and “shameless before all men,” he will “fill her with joy.”1[index_split_019.html#filepos776026] Rose may not have been adulterous but shewas hitting the bottle heavily and ignoring the baby’s needs, which seems fairlyclose to rejecting pity, compassion, and tenderness, which should have madeAiwass happy. Crowley’s accusation would have made more sense if Rose had takenbetter care of the child. But such logic escaped him. The madcap marriage was onthe rocks, although Rose gave birth to a second child—a girl, Lola Zaza, in thewinter of 1906—and it took another few years before they divorced. Saying shehad failed in the office of the Scarlet Woman was tantamount to saying theposition was vacant, and that he was on the lookout for new applicants.The marriage in any case could not last much longer. As the word of the aeon,Crowley could no longer live along conventional lines, insofar as he ever had.He was in the service of the gods, the “Chosen One,” singled out to accomplishthe Great Work of “emancipating mankind,” and such matters as having a home andfamily were negligible.2 [index_split_019.html#filepos776182] He renewed hisfriendship with George Cecil Jones and went through a ritual crucifixion,dedicating himself to a pure and unselfish life and identifying himself with hisHigher Self. Oddly, Crowley’s oath referred to himself as a “member of the Bodyof Christ.” He may have been hedging his bets, just in case Christianity provedtrue, or displaying sheer perversity in including a Christian reference in anoath that more or less announced his identification with his Holy GuardianAngel.3 [index_split_019.html#filepos776336]Crowley declared that he had completed the Abramelin magic on October 9, 1906,in the Ashdown Park Hotel in Surrey, a few days before his thirty-firstbirthday. Rose was in attendance. His consciousness, he claimed, had beenabsorbed into that of his H.G.A.; his success was aided by his use of drugs,hashish in particular. Yet Crowley was ambivalent about using drugs in mysticalpursuits—at least at this time. He wasn’t sure if the altered states heexperienced were the result of the hashish or the invocations to the Augoeides.He had experienced Atmadarshana, a “consciousness of the entire Universe as Oneand as all,” and Shivadarshana, the opening of the eye of Shiva that had sotroubled Mathers, but was unsure if this was simply the effect of the drug. Thiswas a problem; Aiwass had counseled him to take “strange drugs,” saying theywould not hurt him—erroneously, as he was to discover. He wanted to followAiwass’s teachings, but he also wanted his mystical experiences to beindependent of a drugged state.4 [index_split_019.html#filepos776537] Crowleyeventually overruled any hesitation about the value of drugs.—TO PROMOTE THE SALE of his Collected Works (volume 3 was published in 1907),Crowley offered a £100 prize for the best critical essay on his work, announcingthe competition typically as> The Chance of the Year!> The Chance of the Century!!> The Chance of the Geological Period!!! He had by this time received a bit more critical attention. G. K. Chesterton hadcalled Crowley a “good poet,” and complained only about his excessive hatred ofChristianity.5 [index_split_019.html#filepos778402] Even Florence Farr, hisformer enemy among the Golden Dawn, spoke out against the universal condemnationhe attracted, writing about his work in A. R. Orage’s New Age.6[index_split_019.html#filepos778624] But Crowley was still not as well known ashe would like, and in the Confessions he fantasized that “columns of eloquentpraise” about his work were being written at the time by “the most importantpeople in the world of letters,” who “acquiesced” in him as the “only livingpoet of any magnitude.”7 [index_split_019.html#filepos779335] Yet even with thisimaginary praise hardly anyone read his work, and those who did failed to “get”it. His point of view was “so original,” his thoughts “so profound,” and hisallusions “so recondite,” that superficial readers were “unable to penetrate tothe pith.”8 [index_split_019.html#filepos779461]Such was not the case with at least one reader. Captain John Frederick CharlesFuller of the First Oxfordshire Light Infantry had served in the Boer War andhad been stationed in India, from where he had corresponded with Crowley abouthis work. Crowley’s satire Why Jesus Wept (1905) especially moved him. Fuller’sfather was an Anglican cleric, and Fuller, a Social Darwinist, had beenpublished in the Agnostic Journal. He was nicknamed “Boney” because of hisadmiration for Napoleon. He now announced his entry into the essay competitionabout Crowley’s writings. Fuller was one of the few people who appreciatedCrowley’s poetry; but even more important, he was an early convert to“Crowleyanity,” the religion Crowley promoted before accepting the law ofthelema. The fact that Crowley presented himself as a kind of modern Christbefore he heard from Aiwass seems to undermine the idea that he accepted hisrole as word of the aeon reluctantly. Crowleyanity is to thelema much asDianetics is to Scientology.In the summer of 1906 Crowley, Rose, and Fuller met at the Hotel Cecil on theStrand to discuss the idea. By October Fuller’s The Star in the West wasfinished; it was published the following year. It makes no mention of The Bookof the Law, but this wasn’t necessary for Fuller to express his hero worship.According to Paul Newman, The Star in the West “surges along on a rousing swellof purple foam,” and does not mince words.9 [index_split_019.html#filepos779587]Crowley is “more than a new-born Dionysus, he is more than a Blake, a Rabelais,or a Heine”; he is a “priest of Apollo.” “It has taken 100,000,000 years toproduce Aleister Crowley. The world has indeed labored, and has at last broughtforth a man.”10 [index_split_019.html#filepos779712] These are some of Fuller’smore sober remarks. Crowley agreed with Fuller’s assessment—he did admit it wasa tad over the top—and as Fuller was the only reader to grasp the chance of thegeological period, he won the competition hands down. Crowley, however, failedto pay him the prize money. Exactly why is unclear, although by now Crowley’sfortune had shrunk considerably.Fuller’s admiration for Crowley survived this disappointment; his realconnection was their shared detestation of Christianity and their mutualrecognition as individuals apart from the herd, as, indeed, born leaders.Fuller’s admiration for leaders was not limited to Crowley and Napoleon. Yearslater, after falling out with the priest of Apollo, Fuller became infatuatedwith Adolf Hitler. Fuller wrote a book on tank warfare that inspired theblitzkrieg and earned him the honor of being invited to Hitler’s fiftiethbirthday party, on the eve of World War II. After rising to the rank ofmajor-general and retiring from the military, Fuller later turned his admirationto Oswald Mosley, leader of the British Union of Fascists.11[index_split_019.html#filepos779919]—CROWLEY CALLED 1907 and 1908 “years of fulfillment.” His poetic powers, he felt,were at their height, but his satisfaction in his work was not mirrored in hislife. His “domestic tragedy” had become more and more “acute.”12[index_split_019.html#filepos780078] Rose sank deeper into alcoholism, whichCrowley’s frequent absences and erratic lifestyle surely could not have helped.From the start he had confided in his brother-in-law that he suspected Rose ofbeing less than stable. But what stable personality would marry an acquaintanceat the drop of a hat? Crowley himself wouldn’t have been interested in Rose ifshe had been stable; throughout his life, he unerringly attracted women who were“on the edge.” It was precisely their liminal character that drew him. In anycase, Crowley blamed her parents. Rose’s father was a vicar, which put himimmediately in Crowley’s bad books, and Crowley blamed Rose’s alcoholism on hermother, who, he said, allowed her children to drink champagne at too young anage.Crowley showed his feelings for his mother-in-law when his newborn daughter Lolacontracted bronchitis and came close to death. The doctor allowed only oneperson in the room with the baby at any time. Crowley claims his mother-in-lawbroke this rule, and so he threw her out of their flat, “assisting her down thestairs with my boot.” Crowley blamed Lola Zaza’s poor health on Rose’salcoholism, and he did take steps to try to stop it, putting Rose into a clinicto dry out and getting her out into the open air, hiking and rock climbing. Onone occasion he saved his daughter’s life by ensuring that oxygen was on handwhen a nurse failed to supply it. He was rightfully proud of his quick action,but he had no interest in the practical, day-to-day work of raising children andwanted the freedom to do as he wilt. By the spring of 1907 he and Roseseparated. Crowley took a flat on Jermyn Street in London’s Mayfair district,where he entertained mistresses and wrote another pornographic work, Cloudswithout Water (1909), in which some of his lovers appear. One, called Lola, hehad known previously, and named his daughter after. Typically, the bookrecounted the “blasphemous litanies of their fornication.” It was written undera pseudonym—the Rev. C. Verey—and privately printed for circulation among“Ministers of Religion.”In the 1920s, during a difficult time, Crowley considered these years offulfillment and reflected that it was then that he “went wrong,” a verdict herescinded when his spirits lifted. Symonds suggests that Crowley could stillhave salvaged something of his life then, and settled down to some version ofnormality, a belief shared by his great friend Allan Bennett, who remarked tothe writer Clifford Bax that Crowley could have done much good but took a wrongturn in life.13 [index_split_019.html#filepos780233]—CROWLEY FREQUENTED a chemist’s shop on Stafford Street in the West End, run byan E. P. Whineray. Here he got ingredients for his rituals—incense, perfume, hisAbramelin oil—and also most likely his drugs.14[index_split_019.html#filepos780384] One day Whineray introduced him to GeorgeMontagu, the seventh Earl of Tankerville. Crowley refers to Tankerville as theEarl of Coke and Crankum: Coke for his cocaine habit and Crankum because of hisparanoia. The heavy-drinking, middle-aged earl believed his mother was trying tokill him via witchcraft and Whineray suggested that Crowley could help.Tankervilles’s paranoia was surely a product of his cocaine habit—Crowley couldsee that straightaway—but he nevertheless took on the challenge. One must fightfire with fire, Crowley thought, and so the witchcraft-bedeviled earl becameCrowley’s first student in magick. Years earlier he said he could not pay AllanBennett for his own magical instruction, but his attitude had changed andCrowley the mage was on the earl’s payroll. His fortune had dwindled and it wasbecoming increasingly clear that he would soon have to earn a living; as hehimself admitted, his “affairs in Scotland had fallen into great confusion.”15[index_split_019.html#filepos780511]Crowley’s assessment of the Earl in the Confessions reads like a case study: he“enjoyed magnificent health” and was “one of the best preserved men of fifty tofifty-five” Crowley had ever seen. Crowley had the Earl read the proper booksand consult his tarot regularly. For a time the two lived aboard a yacht thatTankerville had chartered and moored on the Beaulieu River, near the New Forest;here Crowley coached him in developing his astral body. But the best way forCrankum to develop his magical powers was to take what Crowley called a “magicalretirement,” an occult holiday, a practice Crowley would enjoy throughout hislife. He had to break away from his family, and so, leaving Lola Zaza in thecare of her alcoholic mother, Crowley set off with Tankerville, first forMarseilles, then North Africa, the earl picking up the tab.The trip was not a success. Coke was a difficult case, and Crowley endured agreat deal of abuse. The Earl soon wearied of Crowley’s perpetual“teaching-teaching-teaching” as if Crowley was “God Almighty,” and he, a “poorbloody shit in the street!”16 [index_split_019.html#filepos780666] Crowley’spedagogical style grated on the Earl, but this shows that Crowley took his roleas a teacher seriously. Yet his lessons—mostly getting Tankerville to throw offwhat Crowley saw as his sexual repressions—fell on deaf ears. When the Earlaccused him of being in his mother’s employ, Crowley threw in the towel andenjoyed the rest of his stay on his own.Crowley donned a burnoose and looked for adventures in the souk, some of whichmost likely included young boys. On one solitary wander Crowley came upon acrowd of Sidi Aissawa—scorpion eaters—performing their secret dances. Crowleywas immediately fascinated and began to chant a phrase he had learned from hissheik in Cairo: Subhana Allahu Walhamdu lilahi walailaha illa allahu—“the GreatWord to become mad and go about naked . . .” Crowley drew his burnoose aroundhim and moved closer to the frenzied dancers, who struck themselves on the headwith ritual axes until their faces were covered with blood. Crowley wanted totoss off his turban and plunge into the festivities, shouting, “Allahu akbar!”But his presence of mind saved him; his spiritual voyeurism was an effronteryand after feeling himself “vibrating with the energy of the universe,” Crowleydrifted away. He and the Earl reunited and left the desert sand for Spain andthen England.Back home Crowley began a series of mystical writings, the “Holy Books ofThelema.” He had already compiled an early version of his Kabbalistic referencebook 777 and a collection of magical essays, Konx Om Pax (“Light in Extension,”1907), as well as a series of hymns to the Virgin Mary in which he “tried to seethe world through the eyes of a devout Catholic,” in the same way that he viewedlife through the lens of a decadent poet in White Stains. We may take thisdisclaimer with some grains of salt, but Crowley’s hymns earned the praise ofsome Christian critics, until they discovered the identity of the author.17[index_split_019.html#filepos780857] But these other works were different.Crowley claimed they were not wholly composed by him but also not entirely“inspired.” The two central ones are The Book of the Heart Girt with a Serpent(1909) and The Book of Lapis Lazuli (1910). Israel Regardie writes that Crowleywrote nothing of greater value after them, and that they display an “entirelydifferent type of writing than he had ever done before,” a claim I findunsupportable.18 [index_split_019.html#filepos781008]Regardie also believes that on the strength of the Holy Books, Crowley cannot bejudged as other men, an assertion Crowley certainly agreed with. The Book of theHeart Girt with a Serpent depicts the relationship between an adept and his HolyGuardian Angel, which, Regardie argues, is essentially passive. “The work ofAugoeides,” Regardie writes, “requires the Adept to assume the woman’s part: tolong for the bridegroom . . . and to be ever ready to receive his kiss,” apractice Crowley was prepared for by adopting the passive role in his homosexualrelations, but also by his fundamentally passive attitude toward life.19[index_split_019.html#filepos781172] The Book of Lapis Lazuli was, Crowley said,inspired by his crossing the Abyss during his walk across China. Crowley did notformally adopt the grade of Magister Templi 80 = 30 until the end of 1909,having claimed the grade of Adeptus Exemptus 70 = 40 earlier that year, takingthe names OU MH and then Vi Veri Universum Vivus Vici (“By the Force of Truth Ihave Conquered the Universe While Living,” which Crowley usually wrote asV.V.V.V.V.) respectively. But he believed that by the end of his Asian trek, hehad passed through the barrier and entered the sphere of the Supernals. He wasindeed unlike other men, was, in fact, no man at all, but one of the SecretChiefs.Crowley had exceeded Mathers in magical rank, and it was time to found his ownesoteric order. At some point between 1907 and 1908, Crowley formed his magicalsociety, the A...A... Crowley began to take on students, and did so for the restof his life. We can regard Crowley’s mystical tutoring as merely a way to fillhis increasingly empty pockets, but this would be doing him a disservice.Crowley was sincere. A look at the “required reading” at the back of Magick inTheory and Practice shows that, if nothing else, following it would provide theequivalent of a college degree. Nothing would be easier than to dismiss Crowleyas an opportunistic fake, or to take him at face value as the champion of humanliberation. Crowley was not wholly one or the other but a frustrating confusionof the two. Anyone serious about understanding him has to master the difficultart of sifting one from the other.At the beginning, recruitment for his new order was low. The first two memberswere Crowley and George Cecil Jones (Volo Noscere—“I Wish to Know”). CaptainFuller (Per Ardura ad Astra “Through Struggle to the Stars”) soon joined theirranks and he was to bring along a new recruit who would play an important rolein Crowley’s life.—BY APRIL 1908 Rose’s condition had worsened. Crowley’s frequent exits for partsunknown didn’t help, but it was precisely this advice that Gerald Kelly, OscarEckenstein, and the family doctor offered: Crowley should go away and threatennot to return until Rose got on the wagon. Crowley didn’t need to hear thistwice. He had kept his wandering ways and when not entertaining on Jermyn Streetor sharing the Warwick Road flat with Rose, he was overseeing his precariousestate in Boleskine, visiting his mother in Eastbourne, or frequenting favoritehaunts in Paris. It was to this last that he decided to repair. He took a roomin the Hôtel de Blois at 50 rue Vavin in the Latin Quarter, an address hemaintained for several years. In Paris, Crowley tried his hand at writing shortstories, something he would return to a decade later during his years in NewYork with his Simon Iff detective tales. Crowley’s occult fiction has itsadmirers, but for my taste it doesn’t rank with other weird writers of the time,such as Algernon Blackwood or Arthur Machen, both of whom Crowley consideredamateurs.20 [index_split_019.html#filepos781299] But even Paris could not holdhim for long and Crowley slipped out of the City of Light for forays intoVenice.In 1908 Crowley published The World’s Tragedy, another attack on Christianity,couched in the form of autobiography. He wanted it to circulate among the youngand “seduce the boys of England,” so they could “bring about the new heaven andthe new earth” by joining him in the worship of Pan.21[index_split_019.html#filepos781690] Speaking of Pan at that time wasfashionable; there was a veritable pandemic of writing then celebrating therandy Greek god (Arthur Machen had made his name in 1894 with “The Great GodPan,” and J. M. Barrie’s Peter Pan had appeared in 1904). “Seduce the boys ofEngland” suggests a double entendre, especially as part of the book is a defenseof sodomy.But what is important is that Crowley is openly seeking followers. “You are nota Crowleian,” he tells his readers with a heavy-handed paradox, until you say“Thank God I am an atheist.” Again it is not thelema he is advocating, buthimself. Crowley made recruitment drives for his occult movement in Oxford andCambridge, but his most successful convert was practically handed to him on aplatter.Captain Fuller met the twenty-three-year-old poet Victor Neuburg at the funeralof William Stewart Ross, the editor of the Agnostic Journal, who died inNovember 1906. Neuburg had published some poetry in the journal and had readsome of Crowley’s verse and he and Fuller became acquainted. Neuburg is littleread today, and outside of Crowleyan circles he is best known for his hand inthe publication of Dylan Thomas’s first book of poems. In the 1930s Neuburgedited a poetry section in a newspaper, The Sunday Referee, and his enthusiasmfor Thomas’s verse led the newspaper’s editor to finance Thomas’s 18 Poems(1934). Neuburg died in 1940.Fuller told Crowley about Neuburg. He, too, had come from a wealthy, repressivefamily, although his background was Jewish, not Christian, something Crowleynever let him forget. Neuburg was reading languages at Crowley’s alma mater,Cambridge, and on an excursion to his old haunts, Crowley turned up unannouncedat Neuburg’s rooms. He had read some of the younger poet’s verse and told himthat it showed signs of promise. Neuburg also showed great magical potential,but equally appealing was Neuburg’s masochism and obvious need for a master.Neuburg was awkward, self-conscious, and unsure of himself, and his appearancematched his insecurities: unkempt, unwashed, ill mannered, thick lipped, curlyhaired, and possessed of a peculiarly piercing nervous laugh. Yet from mostaccounts Neuburg also had a curious faunlike appearance. Crowley was taller,accomplished, confident, flamboyant, and in search of a student. The two weremade for each other, and along with developing a guru-chela relationship theyalso became lovers.Neuburg’s association with Crowley soon led to trouble. Neuburg belonged to theuniversity’s Pan Society—in 1910 he published a collection of poems entitled TheTriumph of Pan—and Crowley often lectured to the group. When the CambridgeInter-Collegiate Christian Union discovered this, they complained; Crowley’sreputation preceded him. An anonymous letter accusing Crowley of pederastyreached Rev. R. St. J. Parry, dean of Trinity, who immediately barred Crowleyfrom the college. (As Crowley was an ex-Trinity man, the Dean really could notdo this.) A fellow student of Neuburg’s and member of the Pan Society, NormanMudd, was outraged when the Dean ordered him to cancel all of Crowley’s futurelectures, and he called on his fellow members to refuse. Crowley eventuallyconfronted the Dean and asked why he had barred him from the college. The Deanhad no problem with magic, he said, but Crowley’s sexual ideas were immoral.Parry finally threatened to expel anyone who had any dealings with Crowley.Mudd, who came from a poor background, was especially vulnerable, as the Deancould cancel his scholarship. Eventually he backed down and promised to avoidCrowley, a decision he regretted for the rest of his life. That he was forced tobetray his role model gnawed at him for years to come.—NEUBURG JOINED THE A...A..., taking the name Omnia Vincam (“I Shall ConquerAll”), and started on his training. Along with extensive reading, this includedeating hashish; Crowley believed it stimulated astral travel, a mystical knackfor which Neuburg showed much potential. But Crowley also subjected Neuburg to abarrage of sadistic practical jokes, ostensibly to “liberate” him from hisrepressions and introduce him to “life,” but also to indulge Crowley’s own cruelsense of humor. At a party in Paris, Crowley got Neuburg drunk on Pernod andwatched as the stumbling poet made embarrassing advances on women. Intuitingthat Neuburg was a virgin, Crowley hatched a plan with one of his lovers, anartist’s model named Euphemia Lamb. Crowley told Neuburg that Euphemia was inlove with him and before he knew it, they were engaged. Crowley then tookNeuburg to a brothel, after which Crowley berated Neuburg for his infidelity andurged him to confess all to his betrothed, who was appropriately shocked andrefused to see him. When Crowley eventually told Neuburg it was all a joke, herefused to believe it, and only accepted it when he found Euphemia naked onCrowley’s bed, enjoying a cigarette after sex. Crowley claims it was all forNeuburg’s benefit, but Crowley’s idea of what was good for someone invariablymeant putting them in sexual situations he approved of. Crowley seemed intent onfashioning Neuburg after his own image, subjecting him to humiliations andencouraging him in sexual “freedom” Crowley style. Whether it did Neuburg anygood is debatable.Crowley’s contemporary Gurdjieff also subjected his pupils to unpleasant, oftenpainful ordeals; but he never gives the impression that he enjoyed it. MadameBlavatsky, too, often made life hell for the people around her, but one doesn’tfeel that she got pleasure from it. Crowley had a nasty streak that his positionas a teacher allowed him to indulge, and it is instructive that he quicklybacked away from people who resisted him. Yet Crowley was a master atself-justification. If questioned about his sadistic methods, he could easilyreply, “But I am only doing it for his own good.”Neuburg’s own good included a grueling hike through northern Spain at the heightof summer, where his and Crowley’s eventual grubby appearance led to their beingmistaken for bandits. It also required a magical retirement in Boleskine. Thisoccult holiday was a mix of magical training and straight-out S&M. Neuburgpracticed the occult discipline of “rising on the planes,” a form of Kabbalisticmeditation. One imagines an astral body, transfers one’s consciousness to it,and then uses it to “rise” through the Tree of Life. Neuburg proved very good atit, early on encountering the angel Gabriel, who wore white and had green spotson his wings and a Maltese Cross on his head. He also met a Red Giant whodismembered him; he was powerless against him until Crowley taught him the signof Horus (leaning forward and stretching out the arms) and the sign ofHarpocrates (putting one’s left forefinger on the lips). Curiously, Neuburgreported nocturnal emissions during some of these adventures.22[index_split_019.html#filepos781850] Neuburg’s astral travels were essentiallyextensions of the kinds of experiences Yeats had when experimenting with thetattwa symbols, but they are also very similar to what Jung called “activeimagination,” a method of conscious fantasy that connects the conscious andunconscious mind. For Jung, the beings and landscapes encountered in activeimagination emerge from the archetypes of the collective unconscious; forCrowley and Neuburg, they are the denizens of the Kabbalistic “paths” betweenthe sephiroth of the Tree of Life. Swedenborg practiced a similar discipline onhis many journeys to heaven and hell, and Rudolf Steiner did much the same whenhe “read” what he called the Akashic Record. (In A Secret History ofConsciousness, I suggest that we have a natural capacity for this in what isknown as “hypnagogia,” the strange state of consciousness between sleeping andwaking.23 [index_split_019.html#filepos782191] Jung, Swedenborg, and Steinerwere all good hypnagogists.) We may argue whether the inner spaces encounteredin Jung’s or Neuburg’s experiences were “merely” psychological or true“objective” mental realms. Nevertheless, each explorer encounters a strangeinner territory that also seems to have its own odd “objectivity.” Evennon-occultists experience this. After taking mescaline, Aldous Huxley spokeabout the mind’s “darkest Africas, its unmapped Borneos and Amazonian basins,”remarking on the “complete autonomy” of our inner inhabitants.24[index_split_019.html#filepos782362]Neuburg’s training included some less magical aspects. Crowley made him sleepnaked for ten days in the cold on a bed of gorse, a torment that Jean OvertonFuller, Neuburg’s biographer, believed led to the tuberculosis that eventuallykilled him. Neuburg kept a meticulous record of his work, and when Crowleydiscovered that Neuburg had been dallying with the Qlipoth—astral “shells” and“husks” known as spiritual “harlots”—he gave him thirty-two whacks with a gorseswitch and drew blood, although why astral harlots should offend Crowley isn’tclear. Neuburg’s arms were soon covered in razor scars, the result of practicingthe stern discipline of Liber Jogurum, which penalizes every use of the word Iwith a sharp slash. Crowley also beat Neuburg’s buttocks with stinging nettlesand subjected him to verbal abuse, making anti-Semitic remarks and berating himfor his Jewishness. Gorse and nettles were acceptable, but Neuburg drew the lineat racial slurs. “My Guru is unnecessarily rude and brutal,” Neuburg wrote inhis magical diary, “merely to amuse himself and pass the time away . . . Itseems to me that unnecessary and brutal rudeness is a prerogative of a cad ofthe lowest type. It is the very limit of meanness to grouse at a man because ofhis race . . . It is ungenerous also to abuse one’s position as a Guru: it islike striking an inferior who will be ruined if he retaliates . . . ”25[index_split_019.html#filepos782594] Gurdjieff, too, could sling verbal abusewith the best. Fritz Peters recounts seeing him rage at A. R. Orage so badlythat Orage, a large and accomplished man, emerged from Gurdjieff’s browbeating“withered and crumpled.”26 [index_split_019.html#filepos782757] But Gurdjieffnever sank to racial insult.At Boleskine Neuburg met Rose who, he later told a friend, was drunk most of thetime. Crowley estimated her minimal intake at a bottle of whiskey a day. Heplaced Lola Zaza in his mother-in-law’s care and told Rose she would not get herback until she dried out. Her doctor said the only hope was for her to enter aclinic. Rose refused, so Crowley asked for a divorce; he had no troubleproviding the necessary evidence of infidelity. Oddly the two continued to livetogether for a time even after the divorce, but on November 24, 1909, theirmarriage was over. Two years later Rose was interred in an asylum for alcoholicdementia. When she was released some years later, she married her doctor; buther cure was temporary and she eventually died of liver failure in 1932. GeraldKelly had long detested Crowley’s treatment of his sister and their parents, andCrowley himself was jealous of Kelly’s success; he soon became a royallyappointed portrait painter and Crowley predictably chalked up Kelly’s rise tolack of talent and a taste for respectability. Although Crowley tried tomaintain custody of his daughter, Lola Zaza eventually rejected him and alsodisappeared from his life.—DURING NEUBURG’S ORDEAL in Boleskine, Crowley accidentally “found” themanuscript of The Book of the Law, mysteriously mislaid some years back. He tookthis as confirmation that a new current had started for him. One sign of thiswas the publication of Crowley’s occult magazine The Equinox: The Review ofScientific Illuminism. Between 1909 and 1913, ten bulky volumes emerged—at thespring and autumn equinoxes, hence the title—and there was nothing quite likethem. The Equinox is generally considered Crowley’s magical legacy. The firstissue appeared on March 21, 1909. A hodgepodge of magical instruction, poetry,essays, reviews, and mystical text the size of a telephone directory, most ofThe Equinox was written by Crowley under his own name or various pseudonyms;Neuburg and Captain Fuller contributed, too. Allan Bennett contributed, andCrowley drew in the occult artist and fin de siècle enfant terrible Austin OsmanSpare. Spare joined the A...A... but had a falling-out with Crowley and did notstay long.27 [index_split_019.html#filepos782971] Crowley also attracted someoutside names, among others, the fantasist Lord Dunsany—a major influence on H.P. Lovecraft—and the literary “buccaneer” Frank Harris, remembered today as theauthor of the sexually explicit My Life and Loves (1931). Harris would remain afriend of Crowley’s for some years, the two sharing a knack for notoriety andliving on their wits.The Equinox was published out of the A...A... headquarters, a fifth-floor walkupat 124 Victoria Street, not far from Buckingham Palace. Here Crowley conductedmagical drug parties featuring hashish but also anhalonium, a form of peyotewhose most well-known derivative is mescaline; Crowley was engaging in somethinglike Ken Kesey’s “Trips Festival” or Timothy Leary’s acid sessions some years inadvance. Some biographers suggest Crowley introduced peyote’s effects to Europe(and perpetuate the myth that he turned Aldous Huxley on to it in Berlin in the1920s; he didn’t) but the psychologist Havelock Ellis wrote about his mescalineexperience in 1898, a decade earlier. (Ellis passed some on to Yeats, who, asmentioned, preferred hashish.28 [index_split_019.html#filepos783223]) Membershipgrew and soon Crowley could count the psychic investigator Everard Fielding,Naval Commander G. M. Marston, the poet Meredith Starr (Herbert Close), thewell-to-do George Raffalovitch, and others as devotees. Crowley described ascene at his temple when “the god came to us in human form . . . and remainedwith us . . . for the best part of an hour, only vanishing when we werephysically exhausted by the ecstasy of intimate contact with his divineperson.”29 [index_split_019.html#filepos783733] (Symonds suggests that this“intimate contact” was in some way sexual.)On another occasion, after dancing around the altar, everyone was convinced theywere being visited by something that “did not belong to the human species” andwere terrified until someone switched on the light and “no stranger was to beseen.”30 [index_split_019.html#filepos783888] One visitor to Crowley’s templewas the novelist Ethel Archer, who had published some poetry in The Equinox.After being admitted to a dimly lit, empty room, where people sat on cushions,she and her husband drank some beverage and then watched Neuburg dance whilemusic played and Crowley recited poetry. She later attributed the “lively”feeling that lasted the week after the performance more to the beverage than tothe ritual, and would fictionalize her experience in her novel The Hieroglyph(1932).31 [index_split_019.html#filepos784009] Crowley’s temple also receivedsome press. A reporter for the Daily Sketch attended a performance of one ofCrowley’s rituals at the Silver Star HQ. After climbing the “interminablestairs” he was met by a brother robed in white and carrying a sword. He entereda dark room, lit only by a dim red light. Other men in white, red, or blackrobes were stationed around the room. Incense filled the air. After someonerecited the Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, and the temple was purified withwater, Crowley, robed in black, led a procession around the altar. A “Cup ofLibation,” supposedly peyote and opium mixed with fruit juice, was passed aroundseveral times. The Greater Ritual of the Hexagram was performed, and Crowleyread his poetry. Then Neuburg danced the “dance of Syrinx and Pan in honor ofour lady Artemis.” Toward the end a new acolyte, the Australian Leila Waddell,played the violin, until Crowley declared the temple closed.32[index_split_019.html#filepos784161]The reporter had seen an early performance of Crowley’s Rites of Eleusis, apublic ritual that gave Crowley the fame he had been seeking since his Cambridgeyears but which also inaugurated the infamy that would last the rest of hislife.—NEUBURG EDITED THE SECOND ISSUE of The Equinox, which appeared on September 21,practically single-handedly, and Brother V.V.V.V.V. decided that he and hischela deserved a holiday—technically speaking, a magical retirement. Crowley’scoffers were running low and it is unclear if he, or Neuburg, whose parents werewell off, paid; Neuburg often gave Crowley his own money, and Jean OvertonFuller reports that at one point Crowley sent Neuburg’s parents a letterdemanding £500 if they wanted to see their son again.33[index_split_019.html#filepos784415] With his divorce proceedings under way,Crowley and his student headed across the Mediterranean to North Africa. Theyarrived in Algiers on November 17 and from there took a tram to Arba, where theycontinued south on foot through the desert to Aumale. In a cheap hotel Crowleyagain heard what he thought was the voice of Aiwass. He broke out into a sweat.“Call me,” it said. Never one to hesitate, Crowley did.Crowley had with him a magical notebook in which he had copied out the Enochian“keys” of Dr. John Dee, with which he had experimented while in Mexico. Enochianmagic is a rarity within the Western occult tradition. Although the languagetaught to Dee by his scryer Edward Kelly—who received it from the angelMadimi—seems gibberish (“Madariatza das perifa Liil cabisa micalazoda . . .”),it also seems to have its own grammar and syntax, which suggests that it is notmere nonsense. Dee and Kelly received nineteen “keys,” and the nineteenth allowsthe magician access to thirty “aires” or “aethyrs,” what we would call alteredstates of consciousness. While in Mexico Crowley had begun his exploration ofthese “aethyrs” backward, in keeping with Enochian tradition (Kelly had receivedthe Enochian alphabet in this way), starting with the thirtieth andtwenty-ninth. His lack of appropriate initiation prevented him from continuing,but now that he had advanced magically, he intended to investigate the rest. Hetells us he had no idea that he had packed this particular notebook, but as withthe missing manuscript of The Book of the Law, this may have been a case of“accidentally on purpose.”34 [index_split_019.html#filepos784632] The result ofCrowley and Neuburg’s Enochian adventures was recounted in a text Crowley calledThe Vision and the Voice, which subsequently appeared in The Equinox and whichhe ranked second only to The Book of the Law in importance; much of the doctrineand pantheon of thelema emerged from these visions. It is a sometimes-disturbingaccount of strange visions, angels, demons, cosmic cubes, Qlipoth, weirdlandscapes, magical watchtowers, and mystical initiations in the City of thePyramids under the Night of Pan, and it is Crowley’s attempt to advance himselfas a mystic seer. How successful he was is debatable, but it was after thisordeal that Crowley formally accepted the rank of Magister of the Temple, whichplaced him in the company of the Secret Chiefs.35[index_split_019.html#filepos784882]The idea was to walk out into the desert and, at appropriate spots, “call” thevoice that Crowley had heard in the hovel in Aumale, using the Enochian “key”and entering the different “aethyrs.”36 [index_split_019.html#filepos785146]They averaged about one a day. Crowley and Neuburg made an unusual pair as theytramped under the African sun. Crowley’s athletic frame was turning stout andhis head was shaved. He was thirty-four, robed in black, a pistol stuck into hissash, and he carried a large vermilion Calvary Cross made of six squares with ahuge golden topaz set in the middle. The topaz served as Crowley’s “shew stone,”the equivalent of the crystal ball used by Dee and Kelly. Crowley would intonethe “key,” peer into the topaz, and the visions would come. Neuburg’s head wasalso shaved, except for two tufts on either side, dyed red and twisted to looklike horns. He was not so much Crowley’s student at this point, but somethingmore like his demonic “familiar.” At twenty-six, thin, his spine slightly curvedand his lips bulging, Neuburg seemed to fit the part, and one wonders what thelocals made of them. In contrast to Dee and Kelly, Crowley himself acted asscryer and Neuburg as scribe, a reversal of roles suggested by Crowley’s beliefthat he was Kelly in a previous life. The association is apt; Kelly, too, had avery bad reputation, and at one point convinced the often malleable Dee that theangels required them to swap wives.37 [index_split_019.html#filepos785428]It was not easy work. On December 3 the two climbed Mount Dal’leh Addin, nearBou-Saâda, intent on entering the fourteenth aethyr. But something was wrong andall Crowley saw was darkness. Deciding it was a washout, they scrambled down butsuddenly Crowley heard a command to perform a magical ritual on the mountaintop.They scrambled back up, built a circle of stones, and erected an altar uponwhich Crowley “sacrificed himself.”38 [index_split_019.html#filepos785662] Thiseuphemism camouflages the magical sodomy dedicated to Pan that took place, withCrowley as the passive partner. Every particle of his personality, he said, wasconsumed. (Crowley often remarks that his ego is obliterated or destroyed aftersome magical act.) Crowley remarks that certain “conceptions of conduct” wereinimical to his initiation, and had to be eradicated. One assumes he means somehesitation about his homosexuality. As he had been a practicing bisexual forsome time by then, it is difficult to understand why he needed this lesson, orhow humiliating something he had been quite familiar with could be.Crowley repeated the experience of insanity he had in 1905. “All things hadbecome alike; all impressions were indistinguishable.” This is Crowley’sfavorite state of mind. It is Aiwass’s command to “let there be no differencemade . . . between any one thing & and any other thing.” It is the lesson of theAbyss. Back in Bou-Saâda he again experienced an episode of dissociation, whichhe again interpreted as a mystical initiation. “I did not merely admit that Idid not exist, and that all my ideas were illusions . . . It seemed incrediblethat I should ever have fancied that I or anything else had any bearing on eachother. All things were alike as shadows seeping across the still surface of alake . . . ”39 [index_split_019.html#filepos785817] It’s not an exaggeration tosay that this is not altogether different from states of mind associated withschizophrenia.But the sacrifice seemed to have worked. That evening, Crowley tried to enterthe fourteenth aethyr again and this time was successful. He received a visionin which he was admitted to the company of the Masters of the Temple. He saw acircle of rocks that he soon realized were his fellow Masters. They had becomeas rock because they had sacrificed all—their very life, their desire for power,fame, wealth, pleasure, everything Crowley himself had desired. But that desirehad died in him, too, and so, at least in a magical sense, had he. To be sure,Crowley the man continued to want power, fame, and all the rest. But Crowley theman was not V.V.V.V.V. “He” did not exist. His name was now Nemo (No One) and hehad joined his fellow adepts in the City of the Pyramids under the Night of Pan.One other thing came from Crowley’s sacrifice. It was his first indication thathis two favorite activities, sex and magick, worked well together. It was aninsight he did not forget.The other major event of their Enochian working was their confrontation withChoronzon, the demon of dispersion. This they achieved by opening the tenthaethyr called ZAX. Crowley needed to cross the Abyss consciously in order toconfirm his initiation and a face-off with Choronzon was necessary. Kelly hadcalled Choronzon “that mighty Devil,” but Crowley says he is not an individualbut a chaos of meaningless and malignant forces desiring to become real. We canthink of Choronzon as something like the “Shadow” in Jungian psychology or the“Guardian of the Threshold” in Rudolf Steiner’s system of spiritualdevelopment.40 [index_split_019.html#filepos785938] Confronting all that isweak, corrupt, vile, yet also powerful in oneself is a well-known necessity foranyone concerned with spiritual growth.Crowley entered the tenth aethyr on December 6. In Turn Off Your Mind, I remarkthat the Rolling Stones’ disastrous concert at Altamont, when Hell’s Angelsmurdered one individual and terrorized a small hippie city, also took place onDecember 6, 1969, sixty years after Crowley’s meeting with Choronzon. There’s nocausal link, but given that the Stones were being tutored in magick then by thefilmmaker Kenneth Anger, a devotee of Crowley, one wonders if there was anyconnection. In any case, Crowley knew what he had to face. Although he himselfwas a dark knight of the soul, Choronzon was a tough customer, and Crowleylikened himself to Christ on the cross; in the Confessions he even repeatsChrist’s cri de coeur “Eloi, Eloi, lama sabacthani.” Accounts of what actuallyhappened in the desert that day differ, but the following seems the essentialoutline. Rather than evoke Choronzon to physical appearance, Crowley himselfwould become possessed by the demon. To do so, he had to place himself withinthe traditional triangle of evocation—a magical first, according to FrancisKing.41 [index_split_019.html#filepos786455] The Kabbalistic names ofGod—Tetragrammaton, Shaddai el Chai, and Ararita—were traced in the sand aroundthe magic circle that would protect Neuburg. Three pigeons brought fromBou-Sâada were sacrificed, their blood supplying the subtle energies needed forthe manifestation. Animal sacrifice did not put Crowley off, and he resorted toit on several occasions.With the magic circle fortified, Crowley instructed Neuburg to resist anyattempts by Choronzon to draw him out of its protection. Neuburg then took amagical oath, promising to defend the circle, and swearing upon his HolyGuardian Angel, he performed the Banishing Rituals of the Pentagram and Hexagramwith his magic dagger. His head hooded, Crowley adopted the Thunderboltasana—otherwise known as the Diamond Pose—and peering through his eye slits heintoned the invocation. Some words about the Abyss came through, then Neuburgheard “Zazas, Zazas Nasatanada Zazas,” the words with which Adam is said to haveopened the gates of hell. The Abyss yawned wide and Choronzon appeared.Crowley/Choronzon uttered blasphemies, many against Crowley himself. Whathappened next depends on how much you believe in magick, or in Crowley orNeuburg. Choronzon did his best to lure Neuburg out of the circle. He appearedas a courtesan Neuburg knew in Paris. He pandered to his vanity, offering to sitat his feet and be his slave. The courtesan became an old man, and then a snake.In the form of Crowley, Choronzon pleaded unutterable thirst and begged forwater. He blasphemed against Aiwass, saying their dealings with him are “but acloak for thy filthy sorceries.” True to his oath, Neuburg resisted. EventuallyCrowley/Choronzon tore off his robe and threw himself on Neuburg, attempting totear out his throat with his fangs. Neuburg flashed his magic dagger andprevailed, and the demon retreated to the triangle. He became the beautifulwoman again, and again attempted to seduce Neuburg. Naked and ashamed, Choronzonpleaded to be released from the triangle to retrieve his clothes. After anattempt to get Neuburg to admit that magick was nonsense, Choronzon departed,leaving a naked Crowley squatting in the sand. The operation was over. The magiccircle and triangle were erased, and a fire was started to purify the air.Crowley and Neuburg called it a day.—CHORONZON WAS A DIFFICULT act to follow, but Crowley discovered freshtribulations back in England. The Equinox no. 2 included an article outliningseveral secret Golden Dawn rituals and announced that future issues would revealeven more. Crowley had sworn to keep these rituals secret and Mathers, whoclaimed copyright on the rituals, was outraged. But rather than launch a magicalattack, he sought justice through the law. Mathers succeeded in getting aninjunction halting publication. Crowley fumed; the judge granting theinjunction, he said, was a Mason who believed secret rituals should stay secret.But a new aeon had begun and everything had changed. “Abrogate are all rituals,all ordeals, all words and signs,” Aiwass had said, and Crowley felt he nolonger had to honor his Golden Dawn vows. Crowley appealed and was successful,one of his few victories in the legal world. Equinox no. 3 was published and foronce Crowley appeared in a good public light. The London Evening News ran astory, “Secrets of the Golden Dawn,” and admitted that “the revelations of Mr.Crowley have created utter consternation in the ranks of the Rosicrucians.”42[index_split_019.html#filepos786602] One consternated Rosicrucian was Mathers,who at this point recedes from view; little more is heard from him and he isthought to have died during the influenza pandemic of 1918. Crowley’s old lifewas rapidly fading and a new one was opening up. The victory over Mathersbrought him commendation from other occultists; he was, he said, showered withtitles and several secret societies claimed him as one of their own. The ranksof the Silver Star swelled. But not all was well.A bothersome fly appeared in the ointment in the form of Horatio Bottomley, awealthy Liberal member of Parliament, fraudster, jingoist patriot, and, likeCrowley, tireless self-promoter.43 [index_split_019.html#filepos786763]Bottomley owned John Bull, a right-wing tabloid, and in its April 2, 1910, issuehe published an open letter to Crowley, congratulating him on his legal victory,but also mentioning that it was “a fine advertisement” for The Equinox. He alsoasked Crowley to teach him to become invisible, turn his enemies into blackdogs, and find the treasure of the Djinn. Bottomley had targeted Crowley and waswaiting for a chance to bring him down. If Crowley had the slightest bit ofprudence, and a considerably smaller ego, he would have seen the trap andaltered his course accordingly. It was, however, in his character to persist.The way was clear and he was about to take his first step in becoming theWickedest Man in the World."},{"pageContent":"SIXSEX AND MAGICK> [images/00004.jpg] The idea of putting on public performances of magical rituals came fromCommander Marston, a senior officer in the Admiralty and probationer in theA...A ..., although Crowley had already seen Mathers’s Isis ceremonies in Paris.Marston had a thing for tom-toms; he believed their primitive beat increasedwomen’s sexual excitement, an idea that endeared him to Crowley. In Marston’shouse in Dorset, Crowley, Neuburg, and Crowley’s new mistress, Leila Waddell,had evoked the demon Bartzabel through poetry, dance, and music, and Marston wasimpressed. Although Waddell—Soror Agatha of the Silver Star—played a major rolein Crowley’s life, she did not become his Scarlet Woman. She lacked the requiredpsychic gifts—or instability—and was one of the few who dallied with the Beastand walked away unscathed. Her Australian accent did not go well with theceremonies, Crowley thought, so that may have had something to do with it.Marston suggested that the group bring their magic to the public; the result wasthe Rites of Eleusis described in the last chapter. After a few performances atVictoria Street, Crowley decided on a bigger venue. Seven rites, one for each ofthe ancient planets, were devised and on Wednesday evenings in October andNovember 1910, Crowley’s troupe performed them at Caxton Hall in Westminster.Attendance of the Rites was good, and the performances garnered some positivepress. But John Bull was not impressed and even less so was another scandalsheet called The Looking Glass. Its editor, West de Wend-Fenton, saw himself asa defender of public morality, and Crowley’s rites offended him. They did not,apparently, offend anyone else; Fuller even took his mother to one, and bytoday’s standards they were probably mild fare. But The Looking Glassdisapproved and launched an attack. Their critic wrote of being met at the doorby a “dirty looking person” in an “imitation robe” (Neuburg) and led into adimly lit room filled with people and someone beating a “monotonous tom-tom.” “Ablue-chinned gentleman” in a “Turkish robe costume” (Crowley) read some“gibberish” while others did a “Morris dance.”1[index_split_019.html#filepos787021] The climax of the evening came when “theMaster” told the audience that there is no God, so they can do what they pleaseand enjoy life. The critic also suggested some irregular sexual goings-onbetween the Master and the violinist; a photograph shows Waddell kneeling onCrowley’s chest and The Looking Glass made much of that. De Wend-Fenton wasknown as a blackmailer. He would start off lightly but more dirt would hit thenewsstands unless a certain palm was greased. Both he and Bottomley were laterbrought up on charges.In December Crowley took a holiday, and The Looking Glass was quick tocongratulate itself on running “one of the most blasphemous and cold-bloodedvillains of modern times” out of town. It was a kind of poetic justice. Eversince 1898 and Aceldama Crowley had painted himself as a satanic rebel and hadblasphemed left and right. Now the chickens were coming home to roost. Back inNorth Africa, Crowley and Neuburg tried to encore their honeymoon, but thingsdidn’t go right. Crowley enjoyed himself, smoking hashish and watching dancinggirls, but Neuburg was out of sorts. Crowley left him in Biskra to “recuperate,”but Neuburg was simply abandoned. Next stop was Paris, then a quick visit to hismother in Eastbourne—one biographer suggests he went there to torment the oldgirl—and then back to England.Crowley arrived to discover that The Looking Glass had done its homework. It’svery likely that Mathers had tutored them, providing a racy backstory toCrowley’s occult order. They had dug up everything they could on Crowley’spast—his divorce, adultery, the Golden Dawn debacle. Any skeletons Crowley hadwere pulled out, including the one from Chancery Lane, where Crowley had livedwith the “rascally sham Buddhist monk Allan Bennett.” Bennett had achieved somenotoriety by leading the first Buddhist mission to Britain, but such rascalswere not wanted in England. Bennett’s Buddhism, however, was not the problem. Itwas suggested that he had participated in “unmentionable immoralities” withCrowley. The Looking Glass knew its stuff and stopped short of saying anythingexplicit. But the implication was that Bennett, Fuller, Jones, and namelessothers had had sex with Crowley. Bennett was in Asia and in any case couldn’t bebothered, and Fuller wasn’t mentioned directly. Jones, a married man with afamily, was. He decided to sue.Fuller insisted Crowley sue as well but V.V.V.V.V. balked. Fuller had areputation to uphold—he was still a serving officer—and the mud slung at him wasmessy. Crowley should clear matters up. Crowley counseled “Resist not evil.” Hisnon-resistance cost him Fuller’s friendship. Jones went ahead with a libelaction but did not ask Crowley to testify; he believed that as a friend Crowleywould offer to do so, and if he didn’t, it would be ungentlemanly to insist.Crowley had defended sodomy in The World’s Tragedy. He had sung its praises inpoetry and had associated it with the highest spirituality. But it was illegalin England and that was a consideration. In any event, Crowley’s testimony mostlikely could not have helped Jones. Crowley would either have spoken the truthand admitted to homosexual relations—not with Jones or the others, of course,but with anyone was bad enough—or he would have to perjure himself, and thedefense would surely find him out. So prudence said keep mum and he did.Jones accused The Looking Glass of libeling him as a homosexual and claimedlarge damages. The Looking Glass retorted that they had not said Jones washomosexual, that the language used did not imply this, and that in any case,anyone associated with Crowley had no reputation to besmirch. But the realfigure in the dock was Crowley. Mathers had a last chance to get back at hisusurper when he was called to give witness, as was a Dr. Berridge, ahomeopathist and Golden Dawn initiate loyal to Mathers. Berridge testified that,years earlier, when told that some Golden Dawn members—possibly Yeats—accusedhim of being a sodomite, Crowley neither affirmed nor denied the accusation.This of course meant that it was true—which, in fact, it was. We can berate thelegal system of the time for making a harmless sexual preference an illegal act,and The Looking Glass for its contention that anyone involved with Crowleydeserved what they got. But Crowley had gone out of his way to give himself abad reputation and now he reaped what he had sown. The clincher came when someLatin notes Crowley had included to an essay were submitted as evidence. Thefirst letter of the words formed obscenities: piss, cunt, arse, and quim—Englishslang for female genitals.2 [index_split_019.html#filepos787172] Crowley nodoubt chuckled over these but they didn’t look good in court.In the end, Jones lost the case, Crowley lost friends, the A...A... lostmembers, and new recruits tapered off. The court found that the allegation ofhomosexuality was substantially true, a miscarriage of justice but perhapsinevitable. Fuller never forgave Crowley for what he saw as cowardice and theirrelations soon ended. He was already angry at Crowley over a letter he sent fromBiskra that included a homosexual limerick about Neuburg’s pursuit of Arab boys,as well as a packet of obscene postcards.3 [index_split_019.html#filepos787325]Fuller had a family. Had the letter been opened or been read by anyone else, itwould have caused a scandal and he could have been charged with possessingobscene materials. Crowley never worried if his obsessions caused trouble foranyone else and his loss of Fuller marked a trend that continued throughout hislife. Eckenstein had already distanced himself, as had Allan Bennett. Hecontributed an article on “The Training of the Mind” for Crowley’s Equinox thatyear and Crowley tried to renew their relationship, but Bennett had no time forthelema, explaining that “No Buddhist would consider it worthwhile to pass fromthe crystalline clearness of his own religion for this involved obscurity.”Crowley got out his frustration about the case with a self-justifying pamphletentitled “The Rosicrucian Scandal”—using Leo Vincey, the hero of H. RiderHaggard’s classic She, as a pseudonym—in which he had a final fling at Mathers.The opening shows Crowley at his alliterative best.4[index_split_019.html#filepos787501] He was not a good loser.Around this time, Jacob Epstein, the famous sculptor, had completed a monumentto Oscar Wilde in Paris’ Père Lachaise cemetery, where another “liberationist,”the singer Jim Morrison, is buried—it’s debatable whose grave is visited more.Epstein’s monument displayed Wilde’s penis and so the authorities covered itwith a tarpaulin. Crowley was appalled and devised a plan to show them up. Hedistributed pamphlets announcing that something spectacular would occur on thesite and encouraged the public not to miss it. He then hid in the cemetery, andafter cutting through the ropes securing the tarpaulin, attached thin wires thatcould unveil the monument with a simple tug. Crowds gathered on the appointedday as Crowley hoped, but the authorities, disdaining to be made fools of, didnot send the guards Crowley had expected. The press, too, didn’t turn up, and sohis unveiling was a dud. When he later discovered that a compromise had beenreached and a bronze butterfly now obscured Wilde’s privates, he once again hidin the cemetery and stole the offending insect. Crowley then appeared in theCafé Royal wearing the celebrated codpiece. It was one time he didn’t want to beinvisible. It’s reported Epstein did not think well of the stunt.—CROWLEY MET HIS next Scarlet Woman, Mary d’Este Sturges, in October 1911,through the current lover of his ex-mistress Nina Olivier. Crowley did not thinkmuch of Hener Skene, but he played piano for the famous dancer Isadora Duncan,and when Skene invited Crowley to a party at Duncan’s suite at the Savoy Hotel,he went. On arrival he immediately felt attracted to Duncan’s friend, Mary;Crowley was to use this scene in his novel Moonchild. Crowley says that he satat Mary’s feet like a Chinese god, exchanging electricity.5[index_split_019.html#filepos787721] Their currents must have matched; after abrief courtship, Crowley took her to Switzerland, to a skating holiday in St.Moritz. On the way they stopped in Zürich at the National Hotel. After muchalcohol, sex, and most likely anhalonium, Mary went into a trance and sawvisions. An entity named Ab-ul-Diz spoke to her, mentioning that he had a “bookfor Frater Perdurabo.” Crowley claims that Mary had not heard the name beforeand it is possible that she picked it up telepathically from Crowley. It is alsopossible that she had indeed contacted another disincarnate being, or perhapsAiwass himself under another name. The mention of a book intrigued Crowley;Ab-ul-Diz said it was called Aba and that its number was 4. Kabbalistically Abaadds up to four and Mary didn’t know Kabbalah. Other remarks suggested that shehad other knowledge she shouldn’t have had, and at the end Ab-ul-Diz said hewould reappear a week hence. The Scarlet Woman vacancy was now filled.Mary had a checkered past. Her real name was Dempsey and she had two ex-husbandsbehind her; one of them, Solomon Sturges, gave her a son, Preston, who laterbecame an Oscar-winning film director, famous for his screwball comedies. He waswith Mary on this trip and he did not think well of Crowley. Preston dislikedhis shaved head and single hornlike tuft and he later felt lucky they hadescaped with their lives. Crowley returned the regard, calling thirteen-year-oldPreston a “god-forsaken lout.”6 [index_split_019.html#filepos787875] Mary waslater sued by the d’Este family for using their name for her perfume company;she claimed she had a right to it but they disagreed, and so she changed thename to Desti.At St. Moritz it emerged that Mary had packed a blue robe much like the one Rosehad worn on her honeymoon; Crowley himself had unexpectedly packed everything heneeded for a proper invocation, including the Calvary Cross that had called upChoronzon. The Secret Chiefs were evidently on the case. On November 28 Crowleyturned their hotel room into a temple and after warming up with drink, sex, anddrugs, at 11:00 p.m. sharp Ab-ul-Diz arrived, just as he had said. After severalmore sessions, Mary, who had been given the name Virakam, wearied of the drugsand sex and asked to go home. Perdurabo persisted and the upshot was that theywere to find the right place to compose a book together. Mary eventually leftCrowley—she, too, showed signs of alcoholism—and married a Turk who soondeserted her. Crowley graciously gives her credit for her help and she isacknowledged as the co-editor with Neuburg of Equinox no. 7. She died in 1931.7[index_split_019.html#filepos788070]When Crowley asked Ab-ul-Diz exactly where he was to write the book, an image ofa house on a hillside, flanked by two Persian nut trees, flashed in his mind.Out on a drive, Mary suddenly ordered their chauffeur to head down an overgrownlane off the main road. At the end was the house. The Villa Caldarazzo inPosillipo near Naples was under repair so the owner let them rent it cheap. Itwas cold and damp but this didn’t matter. Crowley quickly set up a temple andthe two got to work. The result was Book Four (1912), Crowley’s most articulateexposition of his ideas about magick. Many consider Magick in Theory andPractice his masterpiece, but it can’t compare with Book Four for clarity andconcision, and rereading it recently for this book was a delight, althoughCrowley discredits himself badly by including petty and unnecessary remarksabout the “Jewish blood libel.”8 [index_split_019.html#filepos788371] It was inthis book that Crowley added the “k” to magic.Book Four has two parts. The first is dedicated to mysticism—yoga—the second tomagick. It is part of Crowley’s early pursuit of “Scientific Illuminism” and“genius on demand.” There is one unquestioned miracle, Crowley tells us: theinfluence of genius, and this appears only in man. With a nod to Nietzsche heremarks that one cannot think of a “‘superdog’ transforming the world of dogs”but this sort of thing happens regularly in human history. The key to genius isquieting the mind. “It is by freeing the mind of external influences . . . thatit obtains the power to see . . . the truth of things.”9[index_split_019.html#filepos788721] “All geniuses have the habit ofconcentration of thought, and usually need long periods of solitude to acquirethis habit.”10 [index_split_019.html#filepos788877] Here Crowley hits on thekey: concentration of the mind, something he learned from Eckenstein and AllanBennett. Although the second half of the book is a brilliant exposition of thephilosophy and symbolism of magick, one feels that after this central insight,all the paraphernalia of ceremony and ritual are unnecessary. Crowley himselfhad grasped this during his Augoeides invocations in China; he didn’t need hismagical instruments because he could do everything in his mind. But if the mindcan do that, what else might it do?Crowley didn’t get the hint, and this is what’s frustrating about him; he oftengrabs hold of an important insight, but drops it and falls back into the“satanizing” and rebellion that he knows is unnecessary. Concentrating the minddoes not require Aiwass or thelema or doing what you wilt, nor even Buddhism,just patience, effort, solitude, and time. For all his being the “spirit ofsolitude,” Crowley spent very little time alone—some of his “magicalretirements” were taken at the best hotel in town. He was practically alwayssurrounded by people, an example, perhaps, of his following the small part ofhimself rather than the great.I should point out that the most important remarks Crowley made about magick arein the Confessions. “Even the crudest Magick eludes consciousness altogether,”he writes, “so that when one is able to do it, one does it without consciouscomprehension, very much as one makes a good stroke at cricket or billiards. Onecannot give an intellectual explanation of the rough working involved.”11[index_split_019.html#filepos788998] The Austrian novelist and occultist GustavMeyrink, a contemporary of Crowley’s, best known for his Expressionist novel TheGolem (1915), said much the same when he defined magic as “doing withoutknowing.” This is an insight supported by the philosopher Jean Gebser, whoregards the “magical structure of consciousness” as the source of Jung’s“synchronicities,” those strange “meaningful coincidences,” which require,Gebser tells us, “a sacrifice of consciousness.”12[index_split_019.html#filepos789153] My belief is that Crowley’s magick, when itworked, somehow induced synchronicities. But Crowley did not know how he didthis. He admits that most magicians suffer from the delusion that there is a“real apodeictic correlation between the various elements of the operation” andits results, meaning they believe that the circle, sigils, weapons, et ceteraare necessary for the operation to work (apodeictic means “necessarily true” andis a term used in logic).13 [index_split_019.html#filepos789442] Crowley knewthey were not, yet he continued to use them. But he also knew that success inmagick “depends upon one’s ability to awaken the creative genius which is theinalienable heirloom of every son of man.”14[index_split_019.html#filepos789597] The “creative genius” was one of Crowley’sphrases for the unconscious. So successful magick depends on throwing oneselfinto the unconscious, something Crowley was familiar with and pursued throughouthis career.—MAY 1912 SAW CROWLEY living at 33 Avenue Studios in Fulham, a fashionable partof West London today but back then predominantly working class. He had given upon the A...A... as the main means of promoting thelema; the Looking Glassscandal had dissipated the ranks considerably and Crowley lacked the patience tobuild them up again, although he occasionally found new probationers among thewell-heeled and bored. One such was the socialite Gwendolyn Otter. At one of herparties in Chelsea he met the writer Katherine Mansfield and promptly dosed herwith anhalonium. Katherine did not think much of the drug nor of Crowley,calling him a “pretentious and very dirty fellow”; she was then a protégé of A.R. Orage and it was through him that she eventually found her way toGurdjieff.15 [index_split_019.html#filepos789724] Other new recruits were thepsychic and palmist William John Warner, who took the name Count Louis Hamon butwas known professionally as Cheiro; and the self-styled “Queen of Bohemia” NinaHamnett, with whom Crowley later engaged in a disastrous legal battle. But amongCrowley’s guests in Fulham was an eccentric German named Theodor Reuss, who sawhim in a different light. Reuss, a Mason (he belonged to practically everyoccult society operating at the time), had already met Crowley after his legalvictory over Mathers, when occultists were showering him with titles, but now heturned up on Crowley’s doorstep for another reason.16[index_split_019.html#filepos789933] Reuss had as checkered a past as Crowley.He had been a singer—he had performed in Wagner’s Parsifal atBayreuth—anarchist, police spy, socialist (he was thrown out of the EnglishSocialist League for spying on Karl Marx’s daughter Eleanor for the Germans),occultist, and journalist and, at the time of his visit, he was the head of theOrdo Templi Orientis (Order of the Oriental Templars), or O.T.O., a fringeMasonic occult society that had at its heart something it shared with Crowley:an obsession with sex.17 [index_split_019.html#filepos790087] Crowley hadalready been admitted into the O.T.O. but had not thought much of it; Reuss’svisit changed that.As with the Golden Dawn, the origins of the O.T.O. are obscure, but they aregenerally thought to lie in the late-eighteenth-century revival of TemplarMasonry. The Order of the Knights Templar was established in 1118 to ensure thesafe passage of Christians in the Holy Land during the Crusades. They soon roseto great military and financial power and in 1314 were liquidated by the Frenchking Philip IV, erroneously nicknamed “the Fair,” on spurious grounds of heresy,but more likely in order to obtain their riches. There is a long tradition thatthe surviving Templars fled to Scotland and there laid the foundations ofFreemasonry.18 [index_split_019.html#filepos791300] True or not, the idea hadmuch appeal and in the late nineteenth century there appeared several fringeMasonic groups claiming a link to the Templars and their secrets. One secret, atleast according to the O.T.O., was the use of sex in magical rituals andceremonies. This put them on the “left-hand path” traveled by Hindu tantrists,who employ sex, drugs, and other “forbidden” items in their worship—somethingthat would, of course, appeal to Crowley. This, at any rate, was the belief ofKarl Kellner, a wealthy Austrian industrialist who in 1896 traveled in the Eastin search of occult knowledge; he was at one point in India at the same time asCrowley, but the two never met. He claimed he had been taught the secrets ofsexual magic by three Orientals—an Arab and two Hindus—and wanted to revive thepractice. In this he was aided by Reuss and two other occultists, Heinrich Kleinand the ubiquitous Franz Hartmann, like Reuss a member of practically everyoccult group around at the time. (Hartmann was known as Dirty Franz; MadameBlavatsky once remarked that his magnetism was “sickening,” and Rudolf Steinerdidn’t care for him, either.)19 [index_split_019.html#filepos791471] In 1902Klein, Reuss, and Hartmann had received from the impecunious John Yarker—ahigh-ranking Mason fallen on hard times—a charter to establish a Berlin lodge ofthe Memphis and Misraim rite—thought to have been started by Crowley’s earlierself, Cagliostro, in the eighteenth century. Apparently Yarker was so hard up hewould grant a charter to whoever could pay; it was out of this that the O.T.O.emerged. Kellner is also thought to have had contact with the mysteriousHermetic Brotherhood of Luxor, an occult organization of the late nineteenthcentury that incorporated some of the ideas about sexual magic of the Americanmixed-race occultist Paschal Beverly Randolph.20[index_split_019.html#filepos791739] Like Crowley, Randolph used drugs as an aidto mystical states; he has been described by the esoteric scholar ChristopherBamford as “in equal parts authentic and a fake”—again like Crowley. Randolph,an unstable character, blew his brains out in 1875 at the age of forty-five.21[index_split_019.html#filepos791871]Reuss turned up at Crowley’s door because he believed Crowley had given away thesecrets of the IX0 grade of the O.T.O.; the earlier grades were more or lessstraightforward Masonic affairs and were ritually conferred, but the laterdegrees were hush-hush and different. Crowley said he had no idea what Reuss wastalking about, and in any case, could not give away secrets he did not have;Crowley had not been initiated into the IX0. Reuss is said to have grabbed acopy of Crowley’s The Book of Lies, a collection of obscure Kabbalisticaphorisms—something like Zen koans but less accessible—from his shelf and openedit. The import of The Book of Lies (1913) may occasionally reach an unpreparedreader, but for the most part, in order to grasp its often-incisive wit aknowledge of Crowley’s philosophy and obsessions is required.22[index_split_019.html#filepos792213] But Reuss knew his stuff. He turned to thechapter titled “The Star Sapphire” and read: “Let the adept be armed with hismagic rood and provided with his mystic rose.” At that the bell rang and Crowleyunderstood: rood was penis and rose was vagina. The IX0 secret was about sex.Ever since his experience with Neuburg on Mount Dal’leh Addin Crowley knew therewas some connection between his two favorite pastimes. His recent experiencewith Soror Virakam in Italy pointed in that direction, too. But now it hit him.Instead of using all the clumsy appurtenances of ceremony to work up thenecessary state of ecstasy, Crowley could use sex, which would be faster andmore reliable. It was obvious. Why hadn’t he thought of it earlier? The secretof sacred sex was not that secret; it formed part of Eastern religions and, asmentioned earlier, figures such as Count Zinzendorf and Swedenborg knew of it inthe West. But its use for magic was something else.Reuss accepted Crowley’s explanation—he had hit on the secret intuitively—andtold Crowley of the importance of using the male and female sexual fluids in akind of sexual alchemy. Crowley explained the importance of sodomy. It was clearthey were both working along the same lines and should join forces. By JuneReuss had initiated both Crowley and Leila Waddell into the IX0. (VIII0 O.T.O.workings involve “magical masturbation,” the X0 is a purely administrativegrade, and Crowley soon added an XI0 homosexual working grade, the twin ones ofthe number 11 symbolizing, one imagines, two penises; one suspects that hadCrowley created a lesbian grade, it would have been OO0.) Soon after in Berlinhe made Crowley the head of the O.T.O. in Great Britain, giving him the title ofSupreme and Holy King of Ireland, Iona, and all the Britains within theSanctuary of the Gnosis.23 [index_split_019.html#filepos792654] Crowley added tothis the title Baphomet, the name of the satanic deity the Templars were accusedof worshipping (it is thought to be a corruption of Mohammed). From then on theO.T.O. became Crowley’s main organ of dissemination; his British lodge wascalled Mysteria Mystica Maxima. One early recruit, Vittoria Cremers, wasappointed manager of the M.M.M.’s property, but was soon relieved of her dutiesby Crowley, who accused her of embezzling funds. This was most likely untrue andis more likely an example of Crowley’s paranoia. Cremers had earlier beeninvolved with Madame Blavatsky’s journal Lucifer and claimed to know the realidentity of Jack the Ripper.24 [index_split_019.html#filepos793134] Crowleyjoked that Blavatsky herself was the Ripper.25[index_split_019.html#filepos793290] Although Cremers may have been prejudiced,her assessment of Crowley bears noting: “It was sex that rotted him. It was sex,sex, sex, sex, sex all the way with Crowley. He was a sex maniac.”26[index_split_019.html#filepos793463]—ONE OF CROWLEY’S first acts as head of the British O.T.O. was to rewrite theirrituals, incorporating the theology of The Book of the Law.27[index_split_019.html#filepos794917] Some of these were published in theO.T.O.’s journal, The Oriflame, and caused something of a scandal. O.T.O.members saw sex as sacred but Crowley’s thelemic ideas were frankly unpalatableand Reuss received some criticism. Especially questionable was Crowley’s GnosticMass, which made the secret of the IX0 fairly explicit and which calledparticipants to believe in Baphomet and in “one Gnostic Catholic Church ofLight, Love, and Liberty, the Word of whose Law is θEΛHMA” (thelema in Greek).28[index_split_019.html#filepos795159] Reuss himself had not counted on swallowingall of Crowley’s idées fixes or on his insatiable ego. Dissonance betweenCrowley’s philosophy and the aims of the O.T.O. arose again in the 1920s, butfor the moment Crowley was in place and little could be done.Crowley himself did well out of the bargain. A manifesto of the M.M.M. promisinginitiates “instruction in the whole body of hidden knowledge,” “the Knowledge ofthe Preparation and Use of the Universal Medicine,” as well as an introductionto “those persons most complemental to their own nature”—a kind of tantricdating service—attracted some customers.29 [index_split_019.html#filepos795328]Crowley charged around £100 for membership, as well as a hefty annualsubscription. Yet even with this the Beast was often hard up. He made ends meetby putting on private occult shows for the curious and the jaded. The popular“haunted house” writer Elliott O’Donnell attended one in Crowley’s Fulham studioand wrote about it in Rooms of Mystery (1931). In the clichéd darkened roomO’Donnell was treated to a reading of something called the Book of Death; he wasthen serenaded by different women emerging from wooden boxes playing harps,rather like jack-in-the-boxes. Crowley then announced that he would “cut mychest”—as Iggy Pop famously did at Max’s Kansas City in 1973—and then dip aburning wafer in his blood.30 [index_split_019.html#filepos795475] O’Donnellknew it was all hokum and Crowley did, too, but it did his reputation no good.The American journalist Harry Kemp attended another performance and wrote aboutit in the World Magazine. In a dark, incense-laden room he found Crowley, the“high priest,” sitting before a black altar on which a gold circle and serpentrested. Women wearing masks formed a procession as the high priest chanted,“There is no good. Evil is good. Blessed be the principal of Evil. All hail,Prince of the World, to whom even God Himself has given dominion. . . .” Thengeneral pandemonium broke out and an orgy ensued. It all sounds like somethingout of a Hammer horror film and, in fact, Crowley inspired some classic blackmagic movies. He was not pleased with Kemp’s article, but he had only himself toblame. From the beginning he placed himself on Satan’s side and this kind ofthing was inevitable.31 [index_split_019.html#filepos795632]But Crowley was nothing if not versatile. Another moneymaking gambit was TheRagged Ragtime Girls, a troupe of women musicians led by Leila Waddell, whomCrowley had somehow engaged to perform in Moscow in the summer of 1913.32[index_split_019.html#filepos795847] (It is curious to note that Gurdjieff wasstarting his first Moscow groups at around the same time.) In the spring someperformances at London’s Tivoli had encouraged him, so they headed east for asix-week engagement in Moscow at an open-air pleasure park called the Aquarium.Once there Crowley left the girls—among whom, according to him, were “threedipsomaniacs and four nymphomaniacs” as well as a couple of prudes—to theirdevices and occupied himself with a Hungarian woman named Anny Ringler, asadomasochist he met at a café who fulfilled Crowley’s requirements. Ringlerached for “some satisfaction beyond earth’s power to supply,” but apparentlyCrowley could do the trick. Pleasure had no meaning for her, only pain, andCrowley was accommodating. She met his masochistic needs as well, and the twoseemed made for each other. Like sin-ridden flagellants they flogged each other;Crowley made Anny happy by inflicting “physical cruelties as she directed” andshe returned the favor. Crowley’s account of their meeting in the Confessionssuggests that he should have tried his hand at romance fiction: Anny was “tall,tense, lean as a starving leopardess, with wild insatiable eyes . . . We cametogether with irresistible magnetism.”33 [index_split_019.html#filepos796188]Besides having a “strong” time with Anny, she also inspired his best knownpoetical work, the oft-quoted “Hymn to Pan,” as well as The Ship, a verse playwhose chorus found a place in some O.T.O. rituals. Anny lifted Crowley to“heights of ecstasy” and inspired him to an orgy of writing.In September 1913 the last issue of the first volume of The Equinox appeared,and on his return to England Crowley felt the need for a change. Theconversation with Reuss had made him think about his direction. It was time toforge a new magical methodology. The March issue of The Equinox had containedhis essay “Energized Enthusiasm,” in which he proposed that the use of wine,women, and song—or, in more familiar parlance, sex, drugs, and rock ’n’roll—could be an aid in magical ritual. Crowley wanted to put these insightsinto practice. What this amounted to was his first full-scale sex magickoperation, known as “the Paris Working.”It began in Paris on New Year’s Eve 1913 and continued for the next six weeks.For the work Crowley required Neuburg, who had apparently forgiven him for hisperceived part in the suicide of Jeanne Heyse, an actress with whom Neuburg hadfallen in love. For the Rites of Eleusis performances at Caxton Hall, a largercast was needed and the part of the Moon was played by an actress named Ione deForest, whose real name was Jeanne Heyse. Neuburg fell in love with Jeanne andthey had an affair. Crowley disapproved; Jeanne got the message and marriedsomeone else. She and Neuburg continued their affair but the stress was greatand the marriage was a failure. Depressed by this, she committed suicide in1912. Neuburg was crushed and blamed Crowley for her death.Jeanne was by all accounts neurotic and unstable and might very well have killedherself without Crowley’s help. But in Magick in Theory and Practice Crowleywent out of his way to link himself to her suicide. Crowley wrote that “theMaster Therion once found it necessary to slay a Circe who was bewitchingbrethren. He merely walked to the door of her room, and drew an Astral T(‘traditore’, and the symbol of Saturn) with an astral dagger. Within 48 hoursshe shot herself.” Whether Crowley actually drew his “Astral T” or not, the factthat he took credit for Jeanne’s death shows him in a very bad light.The Paris Working would be the last magical ritual Neuburg performed withCrowley; after it he finally broke with his guru. Crowley also acquired someother participants. Walter Duranty was a foreign correspondent for the New YorkTimes—in 1932 he won the Pulitzer Prize—and his lover and future wife, JaneChéron, was Crowley’s ex-mistress; the Paris Working took place at her flat.Jane smoked opium, and years later, in Sicily, Crowley mused over the women inhis life and came to the conclusion that he loved Jane “for her opium soul.”34[index_split_019.html#filepos796343]The aim of the working was the invocation of Mercury—actually Hermes-Thoth, theGreco-Egyptian syncretic god—and Jupiter.35 [index_split_019.html#filepos796604]Mercury, the god of writing, was to inspire Crowley to greater poetic heights,while Jupiter, the god of good fortune, was to bestow much-needed money. By thistime Neuburg’s parents were frantic over the amounts he was handing over to hisguru. The operation, which included drugs—most likely anhalonium—as well as sexbegan with Duranty bestowing the “sacrament” on Crowley: again, a euphemism forsodomy with Crowley as the passive partner. Crowley then painted a pantacle—amagical amulet—for Mercury while Neuburg danced the Banishing Ritual of thePentagram. As in Boleskine, the Paris Working required S&M. Crowley scourgedNeuburg’s buttocks, cut a cross over his heart, and bound his forehead with achain. The sex magick began proper with another act with Neuburg taking theactive part and Crowley again the recipient. During these proceedings the twofraters of the Great White Brotherhood—as Crowley often referred to theA...A...—chanted one of Duranty’s invocations:> Jungitur in vati vates, rex inclyte rhabdou> Hermes tu venias, verba nefanda ferens. This translates as “Magician is joined with magician, Hermes King of the Rod,appear, bringing the unspeakable word.” Apparently Neuburg was not excited bythe proceedings, as he failed to climax. Nevertheless, Crowley deemed it asuccess. He saw a golden Mercury against a brilliantly colored background, feltthe god’s tongue inside his brain, making his skull phosphorescent, saw swarmsof caducei fill the room, and a sword of light cut across a weird sky. Whetherthese were gifts of Mercury or the effect of the anhalonium is debatable. Thenext day they tried again and this time Neuburg did achieve orgasm and Crowleywas able to speak with the god, or who- or whatever responded to his questions.A variety of insights were obtained, and Crowley recorded them in two texts, TheBook of the High Magick Art and The Esoteric Record, which were compiled byNeuburg. Crowley was told that “Every drop of semen which Hermes sheds is aworld . . . People upon the worlds are like maggots upon an apple, all forms oflife bred by the worlds are in the nature of parasites . . . Ma is the name ofthe god who seduced the Phallus away from the Yoni [female genitals] . . . Allworlds are excreta, they represent wasted semen . . .” Crowley was also informedthat, even after Mount Dal’leh Addin, he still retained sufficient amounts ofsexual shame to have to be humiliated again. Crowley complied and, in thepresence of Jane Chéron and Neuburg, was ritually sodomized by Walter Duranty.Crowley had been ridding himself of sexual shame for some time by then and onewonders if he would have had better luck with a psychotherapist.During another session Neuburg became possessed and spoke of the dangers ofunleashing a powerful magical force that would result in internationalcomplications. He also later made several predictions, none of which panned out.Then it was Crowley’s turn, although they suspected that the entity possessinghim was an evil spirit posing as Hermes-Thoth. Crowley was informed that thesupreme sexual-magical act was the ritual rape, murder, and dismemberment of avirgin. The body parts would be offered to various gods. Another“liberationist,” Georges Bataille, did plan the ritual murder of a member of hissecret society, but Crowley drew the line here; they decided to pass. He would,though, tease his readers with remarks about human sacrifice in Magick in Theoryand Practice.During another session, Crowley sank into reveries about his and Neuburg’s pastlives. He recalled that in ancient Crete, he was a female dancer named Aia, andNeuburg was Mardocles, an aspiring initiate. As part of his initiation Mardocleshad to watch Aia perform an erotic dance. He had two choices: either he remainunaffected or rape her. Failing this, he would be castrated. Mardocles/Neuburgfailed; he could not restrain himself but would not rape Aia/Crowley. But thehigh priest showed mercy and sold them both as sex slaves, whose job was toamuse their owners with “various copulations.”Vittoria Cremers may have had a grudge against Crowley when she said he was asex maniac, but the Paris Working suggests she wasn’t far off. I would even saythat it was not sex as much as his own penis that obsessed Crowley. He laterfamously drew an idealized self-portrait with his forehead looking like anengorged glans and signed his name with a massively erect A, complete withtesticles, and in 1917 Crowley would write another pornographic work, Not theLife and Adventures of Sir Roger Bloxham, in which his penis, testicles, andother unmentionables are the protagonists.36[index_split_019.html#filepos796837] In one O.T.O. document written after theParis Working, Crowley repudiates all organized religion, and states that thesun and its earthly representative, the penis, is the true deity. As Crowley wasthe vice regent of this faith, this made his own penis holy.The Paris Working convinced Crowley of the efficacy of sex in magicaloperations, but we may question this. One of his aims was inspiration forwriting, and a story written at the time, “The Stratagem,” is often held up asexemplary. At the time it was accepted by the English Review and H. L. Mencken,the great American editor, published it a few years later.37[index_split_019.html#filepos797577] It is, to my taste, a predictable work,although its self-collapsing character may suggest something done later and muchbetter by Borges. As for money, Neuburg did, in fact, come in to some, sent byan aunt. His family sent him money regularly, although Crowley was peeved thathis chela’s largesse no longer extended to his master. It was a sign that theirmagical and sexual liaison dangereuse was at an end. Neuburg, in fact, wassickened by the Paris Working; according to his biographer, he suffered anervous breakdown afterward and required medical attention.Back in London Neuburg avoided Crowley and eventually annulled his A...A...oath. Predictably, Crowley cursed him. Vittoria Cremers helped Neuburg duringthis period; for her, Crowley was little more than a charlatan and sheencouraged Neuburg to cut his ties. He did, but it was not easy and for the restof his life Neuburg retained a fear of Frater Perdurabo. When Neuburg was livingin a cottage in Sussex, running a small poetry press, and more or less a brokenman, Crowley knocked on his door. Neuburg had avoided him for years but he wasin constant fear that Aia would return to darken his life; he must have dreadedthe idea that they might reincarnate together again sometime. Neuburg’s wifetold the Beast that Frater Omnia Vincam was not at home. He was out walking hisdog and somehow word got to him to stay away. He did. Eventually the Beast leftbut it is said that on occasion he terrified Neuburg’s neighbors by sending hisScarlet Women who exposed their breasts upon which he had made the mark of theBeast. Neuburg died in 1940 in London in his flat on Boundary Road, not far fromwhere I live today.The Paris Working may have cost Crowley Neuburg, but what he got in returnseemed worth the price. He was convinced that sex magick surpassed all otherforms and that it promised access to an incalculable power. In Liber Agape, DeArte Magica, and other works written after the Paris Working and limited toselect members of the O.T.O., Crowley sings the praises—in very obscure andflowery language—of his discovery, calling the mixed male and female sexualfluids “the most powerful and radiant thing that existeth in the universe.”38[index_split_019.html#filepos797808] Through the proper use of sex magick, manmay “impose his will on Nature herself,” and by consuming the “sacrament” (themixed fluids) one becomes “capable of transmuting an unlimited quantity of baseand blind matter into the plastic and docile image of the will.”39[index_split_019.html#filepos798536] It is best, however, if one’s partner inthis miracle “should be in ignorance of the sacred character of the Office”—thatis, she shouldn’t know what you are about.40[index_split_019.html#filepos798777] Although it is best if she is “robust,vigorous, eager, hot and healthy . . . easily enflamed and nighinextinguishable,” it is also good to “make love to disgusting women,” and toapply oneself to “all such things as are naturally repulsive.”41[index_split_019.html#filepos798904] This last chimes with Crowley’s crank ideathat “the supreme masters of the world seek ever the vilest and most horriblecreatures for their concubines,” in their need to “transcend normality.”42[index_split_019.html#filepos799037] This is so because “by extreme violence toNature results are obtained equal to those garnered when Nature herself urgesvehemently to the act of enthusiasm.”43 [index_split_019.html#filepos799235]Hence Crowley’s championing of homosexual operations—magician on magician—butoddly not lesbian. For him woman alone, without the phallus, is “meresolvent.”44 [index_split_019.html#filepos799362] But in the end one should letone’s phallus do the choosing. In seeking an assistant, “it is not unreasonableto allow full sway to the caprice of the moment . . . For this caprice . . . isthe deliberate choice of the Holy Phallus itself”—instruction most men have noneed of.45 [index_split_019.html#filepos799494]—IN LATE SUMMER 1914 the guns of August blazed and Europe was at war. Crowley wasin Switzerland, training for a return match with Kangchenjunga, and it was withsome difficulty that he made his way back to London. There he offered hisservices to the war effort, but phlebitis in his left leg and his reputationprecluded that. He was nearly forty and once again at loose ends. His financeswere dim. He had mortgaged Boleskine and tried to lease it, but that provedfruitless. His books sat unsold and unread, and O.T.O. applicants were thinningout. He had begun to put the insights of the Paris Working to work, and in RexDe Arte Regia—The King on the Royal Art—he began to record his experiments withsex magick. On September 3 he experimented with the aptly named MarieMaddingley, an “easily excitable and very keen” woman who was herselfexperimenting with adultery for the first time. The operation, Crowley noted,was “highly orgiastic” and the elixir—their mingled secretions—of “first ratequality.”46 [index_split_019.html#filepos799629] The aim of the operation was“sex-force and sex-attraction,” that is, to increase Crowley’s own virility andto attract other participants. Later operations would be aimed at money,influence, the arrival of a new Scarlet Woman, or the furtherance of thelema andwould be peppered with Latin euphemisms: per vas nefandum (“by the unspeakablevessel,” that is, sodomy), per os (“by mouth”), per manu (“by hand”).47[index_split_019.html#filepos799785] That Crowley judges the elixir “first rate”is typical of the rest of his sex magick diary. He gives a curious clinical airto his proceedings and at one point calls his sperm “of excellent vintage.”Three days later his partner was a “Piccadilly prostitute,” Peggy Marchmont, a“sturdy bitch of 26 or so.” Then there was Violet Duval, a chorus girl, who wasassisted—exactly how is unclear—by Leila Waddell.But London at the outset of war was no place for the King of the Royal Art.Crowley was convinced that he could best serve England from abroad.48[index_split_019.html#filepos800437] In October, with £50, some books, acollection of Masonic charters, and high hopes—and preceded by some colorfulpress—Crowley boarded the ill-fated Lusitania and headed across the Atlantic toNew York. The new world was ripe, he thought, for the new aeon, and he wouldbring it with him."},{"pageContent":"SEVENNEW YORK’S A LONELY TOWN WHEN YOU’RE THE ONLY THELEMITE AROUND> [images/00004.jpg] Crowley arrived in Manhattan in late October and took a room in a hotel at 40West 36th Street. On his first stay in the Big Apple there had been a heat wave.Now winter was approaching in more ways than one. Middle age gripped him. He wasbroke and for the first time in his life faced real poverty. His left leg stilltroubled him, he had grown decidedly stout, and he was on his own. For all hishopes of success in the new world, Crowley didn’t really care for New York.“Call no man happy till he is dead,” he wrote at the start of his MagicalRecord, taking the ancient adage and adding his own touch: “or at least has leftNew York!”1 [index_split_019.html#filepos800743]An VIII0 opus on November 7, 1914, “Babalon per mentis imaginem manu sinistra”(Babalon imagined in the mind and with the left hand), was to attract a ScarletWoman to share his magical bed.2 [index_split_019.html#filepos800898] It was notimmediately successful and for the most part Crowley was reduced to usingprostitutes. Elsie Edwards, an “obese Irish prostitute of maternal Taurus type”cost him $3; she was unattractive and the opus was difficult, but he had tostart somewhere.3 [index_split_019.html#filepos801142] Florence Galy was used tosecure the attentions of Aimée Gouraud, a rich widow who had escaped him. Sheescaped Crowley again, even with Florence’s help (years later he finally seducedAimée but her wealth was much needed now). Grace Harris aided in anotheroperation aimed at wealth, as did the big Dutch prostitute Lea Dewey, andMargaret Pitcher, who had a “fine fat juicy Yoni.”4[index_split_019.html#filepos801297] On other occasions Crowley resorted tovariations of the VIII0. He would visualize the god Hermes sodomizing him, ormerely focus intently on the god-form, while performing the opus.5[index_split_019.html#filepos801764] How successful these operations were isdebatable. There is a desperate air about them, with Crowley eager for anypossible sign of effect.6 [index_split_019.html#filepos801893] Often enoughunder “Result” Crowley noted “Doubtful” and at times he questioned the efficacyof the operations entirely.7 [index_split_019.html#filepos802367] Crowley alsopursued sex that had little to do with magick. On a single night at a Turkishbath he received the sacrament per vas nefandum from two strangers and per osfrom another, and soon after received it again. On this occasion he was invitedby one stranger—a Mr. Finch—back home to dinner to meet his mother. Crowley setgreat store on his encounter with Mr. Finch and somehow believed that theproposed dinner signaled the start of his initiation to the grade of Magus.8[index_split_019.html#filepos802491] He even performed a IX0 work with Mamie, a“slender rather dark mulatto” of the “lowest prostitute type” in order to securesuccess. But the opus was a failure and Mr. Finch canceled the dinner.Crowley had some success when he met the lawyer and bibliophile John Quinn, whobought some of Crowley’s books; in the Magical Record he says he received $500for them, but it was most likely far less. Crowley was so hard up that whenQuinn invited him to Christmas dinner he was thankful and accepted. Years laterhe shouted “To the lions with them!” at young Christmas carolers before slamminghis door in their faces, but at this time he was happy there was a Christianholy day to celebrate.9 [index_split_019.html#filepos802616] One of Quinn’sother guests was the painter John Butler Yeats, the father of Crowley’s oldnemesis W. B. Yeats. Quinn himself did not think highly of Crowley. An intimateof Ezra Pound, Quinn found Crowley’s magick boring and his poetry third-rate,but his books were becoming collectable, although Crowley himself wouldn’tprofit by their growing value as rarities.10[index_split_019.html#filepos802787]More luck arrived when Crowley was asked to contribute to Vanity Fair. Hisdescription of a baseball game as seen by the Chinese poet Kwaw Li Ya (Crowleyhimself) impressed the editor, who commissioned more work. The astrologerEvangeline Adams also asked him to ghostwrite a book—Crowley claims the projectfailed because she wanted to cheat him; but more likely he quibbled over hisfee. Leila Waddell turned up, too, and helped Crowley with magick; although theykept in touch, she would eventually move on. But by May 1915—not too long afterhis debacle with Mr. Finch—Crowley’s entreaties were answered. He was invited todinner by a journalist friend and there met two women, Jane Foster and HelenHollis, who he called the Cat and the Snake.Jane was a poet, and Crowley felt an immediate attraction to her. She was his“ideal incarnate,” “beautiful beyond my dearest dream”; Helen, an actress, also“glittered with the loveliness of lust.”11 [index_split_019.html#filepos802942]Crowley later claimed that Jane Foster broke his heart and it was with her thathe set his highest hopes on fathering a “magical son,” a goal that for a time hebelieved he had achieved.12 [index_split_019.html#filepos803097] As with MaryD’Este, Crowley and Jane exchanged energies, and the next day, Jane told Crowleyshe was about to leave her husband—a much older man—and that they should lose notime in getting married. Crowley claims that even then he knew she was a fraud,but that he fought down this intuition out of love. Jane had to leave New Yorkfor a month. Crowley took this as a test. He thought the Secret Chiefs had sentboth women to put him through an ordeal, although his love for his ideal didn’tprevent him from performing further opera with prostitutes. When she returned,they became lovers, but Jane tormented Crowley, saying that she detested thephysical side of love; she may, however, have only detested receiving Crowley’slove by his preferred method per vas nefandum. When she left town again, Crowleywas desperate, and to relieve his anguish he spent time with the Snake. She mayhave gotten more than she bargained for. One of Crowley’s more peculiar habitswas bestowing what he called the Serpent’s Kiss. He had “unusually pointedcanines” and he would take a bit of flesh between them and suddenly snap,leaving “two neat indentations.” Often he drew blood: the heiress Nancy Cunardclaimed she got blood poisoning from one of Crowley’s love bites. Apparently theSnake was aroused by Crowley’s bite, and a twelve-hour orgy ensued, at the endof which Crowley woke into “pure love” and had a vision of a diamondlike cube.13[index_split_019.html#filepos803255]Crowley’s desire to have a son was sincere, but Jane was not the woman to bearhim one. She had difficulty conceiving and had already suffered a stillbirth.Over the autumnal equinox of 1915, Sister Hilarion (Jane’s magical name) andCrowley carried out several magical opera aimed at fathering his heir, andCrowley was disappointed when they failed; predictably, he blamed her. InOctober Crowley joined Jane and her elderly husband on a tour of America; hispassage was most likely covered by Jane’s cuckolded spouse. In Detroit Crowleyvisited the Parke-Davis pharmaceutical laboratories, where he topped up hissupply of anhalonium. As in London, in New York Crowley was known for dosingpeople, and on one occasion he got the novelist Theodore Dreiser very stoned.14[index_split_019.html#filepos803410] In Chicago he met the Buddhist scholar PaulCarus, and in Vancouver, the O.T.O. member Charles Stansfeld Jones. Jones—orFrater Achad—was originally from London and had joined the A...A... in 1909,brought in by Captain Fuller. Jones later emigrated to British Columbia, wherehe set up an O.T.O. lodge that would play a large part in Crowley’s laterfortunes.15 [index_split_019.html#filepos803667]The group headed south to Seattle and San Francisco, then Los Angeles, whereCrowley was dismayed at the “cinema crowd of cocaine-crazed, sexual lunatics,and the swarming maggots of near-occultists.”16[index_split_019.html#filepos803932] At Point Loma near San Diego he tried tomeet Katherine Tingley, the head of the American section of the TheosophicalSociety. He wanted to propose an alliance, but his reputation preceded him andshe declined a meeting. By the time the trio returned to New York, Jane had hadher fill of love and will with the Great Beast and dumped him. For his part hehad grasped the truth of her falseness and was compelled to “slay her.”17[index_split_019.html#filepos804087] This meant that he had to destroy the idealof her he had created. His means of demolition was a prostitute, yet somethingimportant had come of the trip.On October 12, 1915, his fortieth birthday, in a railway carriage heading backEast, Crowley accepted that he had passed into the grade of Magus, the mostexalted yet, as it is identified with the “word of the aeon.” In recognition ofthis he took the name To Mega Therion (Greek for the “Great Beast”). In thesummer of 1916, while on a magical retirement in New Hampshire, he formallyratified his grade by crucifying a frog he had baptized as Jesus of Nazareth ina ritual that Francis King describes as “sheer black magic” and “thoroughlysadistic.”18 [index_split_019.html#filepos804222] Crowley went through a mocktrial where the unfortunate amphibian was charged with blasphemy and scourged.The frog as Jesus had “plagued and affronted” Crowley all his life and now the“slave god” was in the hands of the “Lord of Freedom.” He was not merciful. Onceagain Crowley was hitting back at his Plymouth Brethren upbringing, something aless retarded personality would have jettisoned long before. After nailing thebeast to his handmade cross, Crowley put it out of its misery by stabbing itwith his magick dagger. He then cooked and ate its legs and burned the rest toashes.—IN EARLY 1915, Crowley was on a bus heading up Fifth Avenue. He was reading anarticle about himself sent to him by a London press-cutting service, when astranger sitting behind him asked if he was in favor of a “square deal” forGermany and Austria. America had yet to enter World War I and it was stilluncertain if it would side with the Entente or the Central Powers. Ever alert totwists of fate and eager for new opportunities, Crowley said he was. The man—one“O’Brien,” although it’s possible he never existed—gave Crowley his card andsuggested he call at his office. When Crowley arrived at the office of TheFatherland, O’Brien was not there, but he was surprised to discover GeorgeSylvester Viereck, a German-American poet whom Crowley knew in London from theEnglish Review. Crowley describes Viereck as capable of “awakening aninstructive repulsion in most people”; nevertheless, Crowley liked him.19[index_split_019.html#filepos804429] He liked Viereck even more when he offeredhim a job. The Fatherland was a pro-German newspaper that aimed to musterAmerican support for Germany against the British. There were many Germanimmigrants in America and sympathies with Germany were high. Crowley’s job, in anutshell, was to write pro-German, anti-British propaganda. Crowley accepted,and in order to clinch the offer, he even expressed strong pro-Irish sympathies;Ireland was about to rebel against English rule and would receive German help.He even claimed he was Irish himself. He wasn’t and he never set foot there, butnaturally that didn’t matter.From 1915 to 1917 Crowley wrote for The Fatherland as well as another journalViereck published, The International. Much has been written about thisquestionable period in his career, not least of all by Crowley himself. Longsections of the Confessions are devoted to explaining it. Crowley justified hisactions by saying that he quickly realized that The Fatherland—subtitled FairPlay for Germany and Austria-Hungary—was the center for German propaganda inAmerica, and that Viereck, for all his sterling qualities, could not be themastermind behind the operation, which also included espionage. Crowleymaintains that he was a British patriot, and that the “undercover” work he wasabout to embark on was either tacitly condoned or explicitly organized byBritish Intelligence. The responsibility for the German operation, he felt, fellto Professor Hugo Münsterberg, a German psychology professor at HarvardUniversity, with whom Crowley had, he claimed, crossed swords intellectually.Münsterberg, a friend of the philosopher and psychologist William James, wasoutspokenly pro-German in the lead-up to World War I and was, in fact, at onepoint suspected of being a spy. Most of Münsterberg’s work, however, was aimedat dismantling the stereotypes that Germans and Americans had about each other,in the interests of better relations between the two nations. Like manyacademics, he was concerned that war would hamper the progress of knowledge,which knows no national boundaries. Crowley communicated with Sir Guy Gaunt,head of Naval Intelligence, about his “plan,” but Gaunt had no interest in it,and regarded The Fatherland as relatively harmless and insignificant. RegardingCrowley’s ostensible “undercover” work, Gaunt summed it up as an expression ofhis “frantic desire for advertisement,” and estimated Crowley himself as a“small-time traitor.”20 [index_split_019.html#filepos804799]Crowley says that he took the job in order to undermine the German propagandaeffort by writing articles so absurd that no one would take them seriously. Healso aimed to infiltrate the espionage network behind The Fatherland and bringthe United States into the war on the side of the Allies. He knew, he said, thatby doing so he would cut himself off from his friends and his source of income,and be forced to dishonor his name, which it was his destiny to make immortal.21[index_split_019.html#filepos804954] Yet he had done these things already. Hewas alone in New York. He had no money, and had spent years building up hisimage as a satanic rebel and self-serving cad; he had already lost close friendsbecause of it. What did he really have to lose?He would, he said, work Viereck up slowly, starting with “relatively reasonableattacks on England” and then produce “extravagances which achieved my object ofrevolting every comparatively sane human being on earth.”22[index_split_019.html#filepos805109] Some of Crowley’s Fatherland pieces arepatently ridiculous. In one he compares the German Kaiser to an incarnation ofLohengrin, Siegfried, and Parsifal, German mythological heroes immortalized inWagner’s operas, in absurdly hyperbolic prose. Some are funny. Writing ofbombing raids over London carried out by German zeppelins, Crowley criticizedtheir accuracy. His aunt’s house in Croydon, South London, was spared, andCrowley asked the bombers to try again, giving them her address. Yet others arenot unlike the standard propaganda work being produced at the time and wouldhave been accepted by The Fatherland readers, who were never very many, asreasonable. Nevertheless, others are indeed revolting. In one Crowley condonesthe execution of the British nurse Edith Cavell, who aided the wounded of bothsides—“patriotism is not enough,” she famously said—and who helped two hundredAllied soldiers escape from German-occupied Belgium. She was arrested for thisand found guilty of treason, and on October 12, 1915, Crowley’s birthday and theday he accepted the grade of Magus, she was executed. Crowley compares her toJudas Iscariot and Lucrezia Borgia while he ranks Moritz von Bissing, theGovernor General of Belgium, who refused a stay of execution, with Jesus Christ.Crowley had already produced quite a bit of work that revolted comparativelysane human beings, so doing so while getting paid at a time when he was brokewas something of a heaven-sent. It was no new plan but much-needed business asusual. Crowley may well have convinced himself that he was working on England’sbehalf when he accepted Viereck’s offer. His capacity for rationalization andromanticizing would have served him well here. He even speaks of his “duel” withMünsterberg in “romantic terms” as a battle between Sherlock Holmes andProfessor Moriarty.23 [index_split_019.html#filepos805236] But he was the onlyperson to see it in this light. He wasn’t particularly pro-German. He was alwaysand everywhere pro-Crowley, but getting paid to write bad press about thecountry that ignored him would have appealed to his sense of humor. CharlesRichard Cammell, a friend of Crowley’s in his later years and one of his earlybiographers, suggested that Crowley’s pro-German work was motivated by his beingsnubbed by British Intelligence when he had offered his services to them. He wasalso, Cammell argued, appalled by the pro-British propaganda; it went to thesilly extreme of attacking Santa Claus as a Teutonic myth. How writing for theGermans was a response to this is unclear, but Cammell hits the nail on thehead, I think, when he says that Crowley believed that the Germans would seethrough his plan while the British and pro-British Americans would grasp it,too, and Crowley, making a quick escape from a dangerous situation, would returnto England in a “blaze of glory.”24 [index_split_019.html#filepos805363]That blaze of glory really mattered, not the British war effort. Crowley had theunfortunate habit of many obsessives: if they think something should be so, itquickly becomes so, at least in their minds. Yet Crowley’s plan backfired. Wordof his activities got back to England, and in the spring of 1917, police raidedthe O.T.O. headquarters at 93 Regent Street, not far from his favorite haunt,the Café Royal. Some of his associates were also raided. A bookseller who had acopy of The Open Court, a magazine edited by Paul Carus and that publishedCrowley’s propaganda, spent three months in jail. When Crowley heard about this,he was stunned and declared that he would go to Washington to sort it out.Naturally he didn’t. In 1918 William Jackson, assistant to New York’s attorneygeneral, questioned Crowley about his pro-German work. He admitted that he hadno connection with the British Secret Service, and the U.S. Department ofJustice confirmed that Crowley had provided no information about the Germans oranyone else during the war. Word of one of his more flamboyant stunts, however,reached the British authorities who, in the phrase attributed to Queen Victoria,but possibly apocryphal, were not amused.In order to prove his Irish sympathies to his employer, just before dawn on July3, 1915, Crowley, with Leila Waddell and four “other debauched persons on theverge of delirium,” took a motorboat to the Statue of Liberty.25[index_split_019.html#filepos805570] Here Crowley read a parody of theDeclaration of Independence and then tore up an envelope that allegedlycontained his British passport (it didn’t). Then Soror Agatha played “TheWearing of the Green.” Someone waved an Irish flag, and Crowley made a speechabout life, liberty, and love in which he renounced his allegiance to Englandand dedicated his last drop of blood to liberating Ireland. He ended byproclaiming the Irish Republic before topping things off with an “Erin goBragh.” The delirious crew then headed off to breakfast. The New York Timeswrote a few lines about it. Word got back to the British Foreign Secretary, whowas also told that Crowley was writing for an enemy publication. Word had alsoreached the British authorities that Crowley’s friend Frank Harris was also inNew York and involved in similar activities; like Crowley, Harris was broke andneeded the work. Crowley said he tried to contact the British Military Missionin Washington at around this time but was snubbed. If they had heard of thisevent, it isn’t surprising.In New York Crowley made his way into the bohemian circles of Greenwich Villageand began to think of himself as a painter. He rented a studio in WashingtonSquare and took out a newspaper advertisement asking for “Dwarfs, Hunchbacks,Tattooed Women, Harrison Fisher Girls [named after a popular artist of thetime], Freaks of All Sorts, Coloured Women, only if exceptionally ugly ordeformed, to pose for artist.” We’ve seen that Crowley believed that “thesupreme masters of the world seek ever the vilest and most horrible creaturesfor their concubines,” and his choice of models may have had something to dowith this. It may also have had to do with the fact that no matter who his modelwas, Crowley’s paintings tended to deform his subject; whatever he began with,the end was more often than not freakish. Crowley attracted some attention tohis work, and newspaper articles about him emphasized its outré character. Areporter for the Evening World spoke of his studio being covered with “thewildest maelstrom of untamed and unrelated colors ever confined under one roof,”and suggested that they look like “a collision between a Scandinavian sunset anda paint-as-you-please exhibit of the Independent Artists’ Association . . .”When asked what kind of painter he was, Crowley said he was an old master,because “I’m a painter of mostly dead souls.”26[index_split_019.html#filepos805725] He also assured the reporter that he neverstudied art nor ever intended to. By this time his ex-friend and brother-in-lawGerald Kelly was regularly exhibiting at London’s Royal Academy. One wonders ifCrowley’s taking up the brush had anything to do with Kelly’s continuedsuccess.27 [index_split_019.html#filepos805885]Yet, aside from prostitutes, Crowley’s choice of women remained somewhatconventional. It is rare that we find him with a freak or a vile or horriblecreature. In April 1916 he met and seduced Alice Ethel Coomaraswamy, a singerand the very attractive wife of the art historian and follower of thephilosophia perennis Ananda K. Coomaraswamy. Seduced, however, may be too politea term. Crowley did not think highly of Coomaraswamy; in his Magical Record herefers to him as a “bastard, thief, coward, and murderer.”28[index_split_019.html#filepos806597] The fact that Coomaraswamy was a Eurasiancontributed to Crowley’s animus. In his Confessions Crowley remarks on his lowregard for people of mixed European and Asian blood. He calls Coomaraswamy a“half-breed,” “eminent mongrel,” and “worm” and claims that he effectively gavehis wife to him, in exchange for a sex partner of his own.29[index_split_019.html#filepos806755] Naturally Crowley complied. In the bargain,recognizing Ratan Devi’s (Alice’s stage name) singing talent, Crowley used allhis powers to make her a success. He also made her pregnant; his Magical Recordrecounts their first union as “the most magnificent in all ways since I canremember,” and they carried on with several opera after that.30[index_split_019.html#filepos806915]By this time Coomaraswamy, according to Crowley, hoping to palm off his wife,proposed divorce, to which Crowley agreed “with a yawn.” But after Ratan becamea success—due, of course, to Crowley’s coaching—Coomaraswamy changed his mind;Crowley claims that financial considerations decided him. Although he lovedher—as he had loved Jane, and Mary, and Rose, et cetera—Crowley did not care ifAlice stayed with her husband or not, but the fact that she was pregnant withhis child forced him to take action: the baby might be the magical son he sodesired. Sadly, the fates, Secret Chiefs, or simply chance was against him.Alice decided to return to England, where she had other children, for herconfinement; after the birth she would return. Crowley claims that the idea wasCoomaraswamy’s; he knew Alice did not fare well traveling by sea—indeed she hadbeen forced to break a previous sea voyage during an earlier pregnancy—andintended that this voyage would be disastrous. It was; she miscarried. Crowleyclaims that he was prepared to “make any sacrifice necessary to insure [Alice’s]welfare and that of our child,” but, in fact, he did nothing to prevent herleaving for England.31 [index_split_019.html#filepos807414] He explains hisnonchalance by saying that he “refused to put pressure on her,” but he wouldnevertheless serve her with “every ounce” of his strength. Yet if Alice andtheir child meant so much to him, one would think that a word of the aeon mightmake a bit more effort to secure their safety. When Alice “implored” him to takeher back, he replied with “immovable firmness,” accusing her of killing theirbaby.Crowley’s attempts at producing a flesh-and-blood magical child were fruitless,but magick works in mysterious ways, and on the summer solstice of 1916, whileCrowley was performing an opus with Gerda Maria von Kothek—taking a break fromAlice—Frater Achad of the O.T.O. and Vancouver, otherwise known as CharlesStansfeld Jones, made an astonishing discovery. From a humble neophyte in theOrder of the Silver Star he had graduated almost instantaneously into a Masterof the Temple. Confirmation of this unheard-of metamorphosis came in avisitation by the Secret Chiefs and Jones sent a telegram to Crowley telling himof the news. At first Crowley had no idea what Jones meant; the thing wasunprecedented. Then it dawned on him. Jones’s revelation came exactly ninemonths after Crowley’s opus with Jane Foster during the previous autumnalequinox. They had not conceived a physical child, but a truly magical one.Jones’s sudden elevation to a rank Crowley himself had just transcendedconferred on him the status of being Crowley’s magical heir.Jones had become a Babe of the Abyss, but he had also become the “child”predicted in The Book of the Law, the “one” that would come after Crowley andsolve the book’s Kabbalistic mysteries that even Crowley himself could notunlock. And Jones was indeed one: Achad means “unity” in Hebrew. Jones did workon The Book of the Law and Crowley was later astounded that he had unlocked thesecret relations between AL in Hebrew, which means “God,” and LA, which means“not.” This, for Crowley, meant that there was a profound meaning in therevelation that God = 0, the Kabbalistic zero he had written about so long ago.AL and LA also have the numerical value of 31 and 31 × 3 = 93, the numericalvalue of thelema, or will. (Readers with a taste for gematria will grasp theimport of this.) Jones proclaimed these secrets in several books, but eventuallyCrowley turned on Jones and spread a story that he had gone insane and had takento exposing himself in public. For a time Jones left thelema for Catholicism,and there is a rumor that he tried to convert the church to Crowley’s creed. Forhis part Jones announced that Aiwass was a malignant intelligence and that thenew aeon on its way was not that of Horus, but that of Maat, the Egyptiangoddess of justice.On the magical retirement when he crucified a frog and proclaimed himself aMagus, Crowley also had a mystical vision. On Lake Pasquaney (now Newfound Lake)near Bristol, New Hampshire, on property owned by the astrologer EvangelineAdams—they had, it seems, buried their hatchets—Crowley enjoyed the greatoutdoors. For reading he had with him Bernard Shaw’s Androcles and the Lion, andhe took argument with Shaw’s preface. The result was one of Crowley’s bestessays, “The Gospel According to Bernard Shaw.” But when not critiquing Shaw,Crowley continued his magick. Using ether, anhalonium, and other drugs, he hadwhat he called “the Star Sponge Vision.” It was an important experience, and hereferred to it years later in his lectures on yoga.“There is a vision of a peculiar character which has been of cardinal importancein my interior life,” he wrote.32 [index_split_019.html#filepos807578] He summedit up in the insight that the Universe consisted of “Nothingness withtwinkles!”33 [index_split_019.html#filepos807705] In essence it was a vision ofthe unity of things. Crowley saw space occupied by innumerable bright points.Then space itself became ablaze, without, however, blotting out the individualpoints. These points became stars, which were linked to ideas, souls,everything, in fact, as well as to each other. Crowley returned to this visionrepeatedly, and his reflections reaffirmed the conviction that, since all isone, there is no reason to do one thing rather than another. The idea “flea,” hebelieved, is just as “full and interesting” as the idea “Ulysses,” and so,ultimately, one should make no distinction between them, something Aiwass toldhim long ago.34 [index_split_019.html#filepos807827] “To emphasize positive andnegative by labeling things ‘good’ or ‘bad’ is of course to depart further fromthe Tao; but such an act is neither good nor bad, for its opposite had arisenwith it.” “The Tao is not affected at all” and “nothing then matters, as indeedwe knew before . . .”35 [index_split_019.html#filepos808179] This being so, “itis obviously right, natural and easy for the blind being that does notcomprehend all this to follow the line of least resistance, which is to do itsWill . . .” “Nothing can be otherwise than it is,” because “the Tao goes onsmiling.” “Nothing has happened in all these happenings; nothing can happen.Nothing is All . . .”36 [index_split_019.html#filepos808306]In his reflections Crowley tied himself into logical knots trying to explainhow, if nothing matters and good is the same as bad, he could see himself as an“ameliorist,” that is, someone who wants to make things better, as he clearlydid by wanting to help people find and do their “true will.”37[index_split_019.html#filepos808438] But if, as he concluded, “I accept thingsas they are,” and “all the solutions turn out to be no solution,” it isdifficult to see how he or anyone else could make anything better, or worse forthat matter.Crowley was not the only one to grasp the underlying unity of things. Whileunder the influence of nitrous oxide—or possibly hashish—P. D. Ouspensky lookedat an ashtray. Suddenly his consciousness was flooded with everything to do withthe ashtray; it aroused a “whirlwind of thoughts and images” and contained an“infinite number of facts,” and Ouspensky came to the sobering conclusion that“a man can go mad from one ash tray.”38 [index_split_019.html#filepos808565] ButCrowley is one of the few to build an ethical philosophy out of the enfeeblingof the will such a vision can bring. During his nitrous oxide experiments,William James found himself awash in an “immense emotional sense ofreconciliation” in which “the center and periphery of things seem to cometogether.” “Unbroken continuity is of the essence of being,” James saw, and weare “literally in the midst of an infinite . . .”39[index_split_019.html#filepos808734] Yet James ultimately found that this visionof unity produced a “pessimistic fatalism.” It revealed “depth within depth ofimpotence and indifference,” with “reason and silliness united, not in a highersynthesis, but in the fact that whatever way you choose it is all one [myitalics].” James came away with the insight that “indifferentism is the trueoutcome of every view of the world which makes infinity and continuity to be itsessence.” Yet James, unlike Crowley, did not take this vision of cosmic futilityas carte blanche to do what he wilt. He withdrew from it for precisely the samereason that it attracted Crowley: it made him ineffective in the world—itdisabled his ability to make decisions, in other words, to act.Years later, Aldous Huxley came to a similar conclusion when he experimentedwith mescaline. Huxley realized that if everyone took mescaline—a drug, likeanhalonium, derived from peyote—there would be no war, but there would be nocivilization either, because no one would bother to make it. Looking at a sinkfull of dirty dishes, Huxley thought they were too beautiful to bother about.Under mescaline, Huxley recognized that “the will suffers a profound change forthe worse” and that “the mescaline taker sees no reason for doing anything inparticular.”40 [index_split_019.html#filepos809003] Huxley saw the danger inthis, but Crowley made a philosophy out of it.Yet in the same summer that he saw his Star Sponge, Crowley also suffered acrisis. He confessed that he was “inhibited from everything” and was tempted to“crucify a toad, or copulate with a duck, sheep or goat, or set a house on fireor murder someone with the idea . . . that some supreme violation of all thelaws of my being would break down my Karma or dissolve the spell that seems tobind me . . .”41 [index_split_019.html#filepos809201] It was, in fact, at thispoint that he crucified the frog. This passage suggests that Crowley sufferedfrom a lack of will, a lack of any purpose, and having a philosophy thatpreached that nothing matters could not have helped. He suffered another crisisa year later and actually tried to jettison the yoke of being a Magus. But itwas too late to change his spots. He returned to magick, thelema, and all therest because it seemed “there was certainly nothing else for me to do.”42[index_split_019.html#filepos809351]—IN OCTOBER 1917 Crowley headed to New Orleans. He may have wanted to renewcontact with a Professor Keasby, an art historian at the University of Texas,who had shown interest in his work and had visited Crowley at Lake Pasquaney.The idea of opening an O.T.O. chapter in Austin was even floated but nothingcame of it. The O.T.O. itself, at least in England, was dying a slow death.After relieving Vittoria Cremers of her duties, Crowley had appointed GeorgeMacnie Cowie as treasurer. Crowley says that Cowie had first sent him money tokeep him going, but stopped when he learned of his pro-German journalism andthen began to rob him blind.43 [index_split_019.html#filepos809514] If so,Crowley had only himself to blame. Cowie said Crowley’s demands for money wereexorbitant and were depleting the O.T.O.’s coffers and that he was doing nothingfor the organization in New York. Predictably, the two fell out; Crowley claimsCowie got possession of his belongings at Boleskine and sold them for a song.But by then the O.T.O. in London existed only on paper.In the end, relations between Crowley and Professor Keasby soured. Earlier thatsummer, Viereck had made Crowley editor of The International, and Crowleyquickly filled its pages with his work, either under his own name or a varietyof pseudonyms; he was often the magazine’s only contributor. Crowley claimed heaccepted the position because it would allow him to keep an eye on thepublication’s German backers and report his findings to the U.S. authorities,but this is doubtful. In April 1917 the United States entered the war on theside of the Allies; Crowley’s “plan” seemed to have worked, although because ofit The Fatherland became redundant and his own meal ticket was threatened.Viereck saw no sense in continuing, and when Professor Keasby offered to buy TheInternational, Viereck agreed—without telling Crowley. Keasby assured Viereckthat Crowley would remain as editor, but no sooner was he the owner than Crowleywas without a job. It was a pyrrhic victory; Crowley notes with satisfactionthat soon after his removal The International folded.In New Orleans Crowley enjoyed the people, the architecture, the French Quarter,and the bordellos, which, he believed, compared favorably to those in Cairo. Helived near the Old Absinthe House and wrote an article about “the greengoddess.”44 [index_split_019.html#filepos809641] Other articles on other drugsemerged from his pen—cocaine, ethyl oxide—and they make up some of his bestwriting.45 [index_split_019.html#filepos809807] But the most important additionsto Crowley’s oeuvre to come out of the Big Easy were his Simon Iff stories andhis first novel, The Butterfly Net, later published as Moonchild. Crowley’sfixation on producing a magical child, either in the flesh or in print, may havebeen premonitory. In May 1917 his mother died; as mentioned in chapter One, hedreamt of her death two nights earlier. Crowley had done everything he could tolive up to his mother’s christening him the Beast 666, but now when his last tieto his family was cut, he felt a “helpless, lonely feeling” and experienced asense of being truly adrift.By this time, Crowley was back in New York, living with the artist Leon EngersKennedy, sharing a run-down space on Fifth Avenue; it was while living withKennedy that he decided to take up painting. (Ironically, Kennedy is known todaysolely because of his portrait of Crowley, which hangs in London’s NationalPortrait Gallery, while Crowley enjoys a growing posthumous profile as apainter.) He had hit a kind of doldrums; even his sex life had reached a dullpatch. He notes in the Magical Record that his long absence from sex magick wasdue to being occupied with creative work. It was around this time that Crowleywent on strike, thinking that if the Secret Chiefs really intended him to betheir emissary, they should be more forthcoming with aid and instructions. For atime he continued his operations with prostitutes, aiming at “magical energy,”“Glory to God!” “health,” “promulgation of the Law,” as well as practicalobjectives, such as “success to Simon Iff stories.”46[index_split_019.html#filepos810043] This last aim, at any rate, wasunfulfilled; the stories did not catch on. On occasion he enjoyed an XI0 opus;one with a Howard per os had, he noted, no object; he was “taken by surprise” byit.47 [index_split_019.html#filepos810200] There was Anita, Anna Grey, a LionelQ (the details of both this opus and that with Howard Crowley kept secret, evenfrom his record), May, Maddy. The list grew, but by August 1917 Crowley had metAnna Miller, a Pennsylvania Dutch girl presumably in rebellion against herupbringing, whom he christened “the Dog.” They lived together on Central ParkWest.With Anna, Crowley operated per vas nefandum until she showed signs ofalcoholism, an occupational hazard when working with him, and he showed her thedoor. After the Dog arrived the Camel. Roddie Minor was a friend of Anna’s, andshe, Anna, and Crowley sometimes performed à trois. She was a “big, muscular,sensual type,” Crowley’s preferred kind of woman, and she seems to haveenjoyed—or at least submitted to—Crowley’s penchant for sodomy; p.v.n.punctuates most of the opera he recorded with her. They were often assisted by aWalter Grey and a Russian woman named Marie Lavroff, who Crowley wished tosnare, but who did not last long, escaping after an opus per manum—masturbatingCrowley. (One opus with Marie and Roddie was aimed at overcoming Marie’s “sincomplex” and Roddie’s growing jealously; this apparently didn’t work: Marie fledand Crowley had to perform an opus aimed at better relations with Roddie.48[index_split_019.html#filepos810326]) He called Roddie the Camel because shehad, he said, taken him across the desert, this empty period of his life. Roddiewas a find: she was a pharmacist and worked in a pharmaceutical laboratory; thismeant she had a steady income and access to drugs. She enjoyed smoking opium andtaking other drugs and was also interested in occultism. It was through thismeans that, as with Rose and Sister Virakam, he once again touched base with adiscarnate intelligence.The wizard Amalantrah arrived sometime in January 1918, by which time Crowleywas living on West Ninth Street in Greenwich Village. Crowley was writing LiberAleph, a long letter to his magical son Charles Stansfeld Jones about all thingsthelemic (it would not be published until after his death). Liber Aleph isconsidered by many to be an excellent introduction to Crowley’s philosophy, butit is not one of his best works. Roddie—or Sister Achitha—was smoking opium andhad a vision of herself as a candelabra of thirteen candles; part of this becamea crown that floated in the air until a halo appeared to drop into the crown.She then saw herself as thirteen naked women, all being caressedsimultaneously.49 [index_split_019.html#filepos810452] Crowley was intrigued andtold her of similar experiences had by his other Scarlet Women. He suggested shequestion the images; his technique resembles how Jung approached “activeimagination,” and a Jungian interpretation of Crowley’s experiences with Aiwass,Ab-ul-Diz, and Amalantrah would, I think, prove interesting (Crowley had, infact, been studying Jung’s The Psychology of the Unconscious (1912) for sometime, but Jung did not discover active imagination until his break with Freudthe following year.) Crowley guided Roddie through the astral landscape. She sawa farmhouse and heard gurgling water. This disappeared and she saw a yoni andthen a camel and a king and then a wizard. The king and the wizard entered acave and Roddie told them her name was Eve. In the end the wizard sat nearRoddie and told her that “it’s all in the egg.”Crowley was impressed. Ab-ul-Diz had spoken of an egg; perhaps Amalantrah wascontinuing the dialogue he had through Sister Virakam? But although he, too,joined the Camel on the astral—getting there by smoking opium—he was lessinterested in the fantastic imagery than in answers to two troubling questions:the correct Kabbalistic spelling and meaning of Baphomet, Crowley’s O.T.O. name,and how to transpose “Therion” into Hebrew while retaining the numerical valueof 666. The first answer came directly from Amalantrah. Baphomet should bespelled Bafometh and it meant “Father Mithras.” Crowley was astounded: hismastery of gematria confirmed Amalantrah’s answer. (As with Rose and Mary,Crowley tells us Roddie was ignorant of these matters.) The second came out ofthe blue. One morning Crowley received a letter at The International; it wasaddressed to Viereck, but he passed it on to him. Earlier he had askedAmalantrah if one could spell Therion in Hebrew and arrive at the value 666.Amalantrah said yes, but Crowley couldn’t see how. In the letter Crowley readthat its author, Shmuel bar Aiwaz bie Yackou de Sherabad (Samuel A. Jacob) hadsolved the riddle, and reached the exact spelling Crowley required. And not onlyhad the letter been written at the exact time Crowley had asked this question,the author’s name was Aiwaz, which, he later told Crowley, can be written inHebrew so that it adds up to 93. This may not convince us that Aiwass, thelema,and all the rest were true, as Crowley believed, but it shows that like Jung,Crowley was someone around whom snychronicities happened.50[index_split_019.html#filepos810658]But they did not always happen. Much of Amalantrah’s discourse was frustrating,repetitive, and magically void. Crowley’s relations with the Camel were turningthat way, too. Whenever he wanted a new Scarlet Woman, Crowley invariablydetected that the magical force in his current one was weakening. Even whilewith Roddie, Crowley had performed with other women and with men; at one pointhe refers to three women assistants as “three scorpions.”51[index_split_019.html#filepos810818] On one occasion Roddie took anhalonium andgot sick; Crowley chalked that up to her being too corrupt for the magick. Onanother she had the “Vision of the Demon Crowley,” Crowley’s euphemism for theirarguing.52 [index_split_019.html#filepos810975] Apparently Roddie’s orbit wasgoing askew. It was time for another magical retirement, and Crowley performedan VIII0 opus to make sure it would be a good one.53[index_split_019.html#filepos811101]When Crowley told his friend the journalist William Seabrook that he intended totake a magical retirement on Esopus Island in the Hudson, Seabrook, who knewCrowley was broke, passed the hat and came up with the money for the trip.54[index_split_019.html#filepos811223] Seabrook described Crowley at this time asa “strange disturbing fellow, with a heavy pontifical manner mixed with a . . .sly monkey-like and occasionally malicious humor,” whose “American Indianwarlock” made him resemble a “nursery imp masquerading as Mephistopheles.”55[index_split_019.html#filepos811727] Seabrook and his wife, Kate, with whomCrowley had an affair, were part of the Greenwich Village set, which at thattime included some important names: Theodore Dreiser, Edna St. Vincent Millay,Sinclair Lewis, John Cowper Powys, and Powys’s friend, Louis Wilkinson.Wilkinson became friends with Crowley, much to the dismay of his wife, the poetFrances Gregg. She disliked Crowley and hated his control over Wilkinson. Shetold a story of how at dinner with Crowley, Louis, who was normally veryself-controlled, suddenly began to act strangely, laughing at nothing inparticular and talking extravagantly; Frances believed Crowley exerted somehypnotic power over him.56 [index_split_019.html#filepos811953] She also sawCrowley make a man act like a dog, a trick he performed on more than oneoccasion.57 [index_split_019.html#filepos812107] Crowley’s dominance overWilkinson was so great that he convinced him to have Frances certified asinsane. The plan almost worked, until Frances realized what was up and escapeden route to the asylum. When she returned home, she found Crowley waiting forher at the top of her stairs, holding her young son by the hand. Crowley toldher a story about a woman, like her, who disapproved of him, and who came homeone day to find her two young children headless, by the fire. “The poor madwoman,” he told Frances, “imagined I had done it.” Crowley’s animus againstFrances was also fueled by the fact that she caught him in the act of putting onhis wig. For a time before he adopted the Erich von Stroheim look, Crowley’svanity compelled him to use a toupee, and he was afraid Frances would pull itoff.58 [index_split_019.html#filepos812234]Louis Wilkinson revered Crowley. Wilkinson’s father was a clergyman and inCrowley he saw a “warrior against the moral and sexual hypocrisies of the time,”many of which Louis was eager to flout. Wilkinson shared many of Crowley’spredilections—he had “aberrations,” his son Oliver wrote, and followed Louis’slaw: “that Louis should have what Louis wanted,” a kind of thelema in anutshell—and the marriage with Frances soon foundered.59[index_split_019.html#filepos812356] She remained fearful of Crowley throughouther life, much like Victor Neuburg. Years later while living in Essex inEngland, she discovered strange markings decorating her cottage and realizedthey were from Crowley and, according to her son Oliver, felt an “intensity ofterror.” He knew how to nurse a grudge.On Esopus Island, about ninety miles north of Manhattan, Crowley paddled in acanoe, meditated, visited the farms on the small island’s banks, was fed bylocal people—supplemented by provisions brought by the Camel, with whom he alsoperformed opera—and worked on a translation of the Tao Te Ching. Anotheractivity was to suspend himself with ropes along the island’s cliffs and inbright red paint cover the granite with his magical tags: “Do What Thou WiltShall Be the Whole of the Law” and “Every Man and Every Woman Is a Star.” Theidea was that people on passing boats would see his mottoes and be inspired todo their true will. (Crowley was, we might say, an early graffiti artist.)Seabrook popularized the story that Crowley had spent the money he had collectedfor him solely on the paint, brushes, and rope, and that he would, as Elijahwas, be fed by the ravens. Crowley, however, stocked up on food, wine, brandy,and other essentials, and even had a woman sent out to him; she stayed when theCamel was away. When the red-haired and curvy Madelaine George arrived at thenearest train station, having been invited to lunch on his island, Crowley wasdismayed to find she had brought along a huge trunk. Madelaine herself was putout that Crowley’s summer residence was a tent. Getting the trunk into Crowley’scanoe was a feat—they almost sank—and after lunch, Madelaine, who was married,became hysterical and demanded to return home.60[index_split_019.html#filepos812551] Crowley persuaded her to enjoy a row aroundthe island—it was only a half mile long and a few hundred feet wide—during whichthe canoe sprang a leak. After some more hysterics, however, Madelaine decidedto make the most of things and settled into a weekend with the Beast.On the island Crowley also worked at his magical memory, and added to hisalready rich array of past lives. Pope Alexander VI (the Borgia Pope with ataste for the occult), Eliphas Levi, Cagliostro, a suicide, a black magician, amonk who enjoyed inflicting pain on women, a Knight Templar, a deformedhermaphrodite who died of syphilis, and, appropriately, Ko Hsuen, a student ofLao Tzu, whose book Crowley was translating, were some who joined Crowley’sreincarnated ranks. Crowley also remembered a meeting of the Secret Chiefssometime before Mohammed, at which the question of whether to release importantoccult secrets to humanity at large or to keep them for only an elite wasdiscussed. Crowley was for releasing the knowledge; the majority was not.Curiously, this important discussion resembles a similar notion presented byCharles George Harrison, an obscure occultist, in a series of lectures given in1893 in London, and later developed by Rudolf Steiner.61[index_split_019.html#filepos812708] It is unknown if Crowley knew of Harrison’slectures; they were published in 1894 by a company partly owned by A. E. Waite,who reviewed them in The Unknown World that year. But Crowley could have knownof them.When Crowley returned to Manhattan in early September, Seabrook asked if he hadgained anything from his retirement. Crowley, who Seabrook said “held himselfpompously erect and had a tendency to strut,” said he had gained greater power,and to prove it, Crowley offered a demonstration. Following lunch at the PlazaGrill, Seabrook and Crowley walked along Fifth Avenue. Crossing 42nd Street andpassing the New York Public Library, Crowley pointed to a man in front of himand motioned to Seabrook to watch. Crowley fell in step with the man, imitatinghis movements exactly, becoming an “astral ghost of the other.” Suddenly,Crowley buckled his knees, and then shot back up and immediately got back instep. The man he had been shadowing fell; his legs, it seemed, had been pulledfrom under him, and Crowley and Seabrook helped him to his feet. The unfortunatevictim looked for a banana peel and checked his soles, but there was nothing tosuggest why he had fallen. Puzzled, he then thanked Crowley and Seabrook andcarried on. Seabrook tried to explain Crowley’s “power” in some rational way,but in the end suggested that he might really have possessed “power” after all.While enjoying the Camel’s embrace and enduring the hysterics of Madelaine,Crowley already had another Scarlet Woman in sight. In early 1918 Crowley hadgiven a lecture on magick to a small audience. At the end a young woman, whowould later write a book about the dangers of joining a “love cult,” approachedhim. Her name was Alma Hirsig. Two months later, Alma and her sister Leah cameto Crowley’s studio at 1 University Place. They were looking for lodgings in thearea and thought Crowley could help. While Alma spoke, Crowley looked at Leahand apropos of nothing kissed her. He continued to kiss her even as Almacontinued talking, and the two were still kissing when Alma left. It wasn’tuntil January 1919 that Crowley and Leah met again. By this time Crowley’scanvases had accumulated. While Alma and Leah stood admiring the screen thatconcealed his bed and on which he had painted a sun, a moon, and the Hindu holyfire, Crowley—the story goes—started to undress Leah. She was not his type:tall, thin, flat chested, “a little mouse like creature, pure and sweet,”according to her sister. Leah was thirty-five, teaching in the Bronx, andattending lectures in law at New York University; she also had a child by a manwho had left her. Yet Crowley detected something that allowed him tounceremoniously undress her and begin a sketch. “What shall I paint you as?” heasked. “Paint me as a dead soul,” she said.He did. In an orgy of inspiration Crowley spent the night creating what heconsidered an undeniable work of genius. In Dead Souls, Leah’s thin body, herskin a garish green wrapped in bluish shadows, is flanked by two women, onewhite, one black, both gazing at the Queen of Dead Souls. On the black woman’sshoulder rests a huge parrot, while the white woman writhes in agony. Below allthree are strangely shaped heads, suggesting, Crowley said, “all anguish, allperversity, all banishment from the world of reasonable things.”Not long after Crowley completed his masterwork, Leah returned to his studio.Crowley had her kneel within a magic circle he had painted on the floor. Afterperforming the Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, he inaugurated her reign asthe Scarlet Woman with, one assumes, a IX0 opus. He then painted the mark of theBeast between Leah’s boyish breasts. How often he painted it or if Leahoccasionally touched it up herself is unclear. But it was clearly visible toWilliam Seabrook, who saw it often, as Leah hung about Crowley’s studio on mostoccasions stark naked. Crowley would return to England soon. He had not been ahit in the United States. The new world had not cottoned to the new aeon. Infact, he had made things worse for himself, as he was now considered a traitor.But he was not going back empty-handed. His new Scarlet Woman was coming withhim."},{"pageContent":"EIGHTIN AND OUT OF THE ABBEY OF THELEMA> [images/00004.jpg] Crowley’s exit from New York in late 1919 was not auspicious. He had arrangedfor a publisher in Detroit to bring out a new issue of The Equinox. Volume IIhad been one of silence—to balance the first volume of speech—and volume III,no. 1, known as the blue Equinox—because of its sky-blue cover—was to get thingsback in step. Crowley, however, was unhappy with the way it was produced and,predictably, blamed the publisher, some Freemasons, for cutting costs. Thepublication did, however, contain the Leon Engers Kennedy portrait, Crowley’s“Hymn to Pan,” and an O.T.O. recruitment letter, and is now considered rare. Tobring some closure to his U.S. adventure, Crowley took one last magicalretirement, this time in Montauk on Long Island, but it was not a success; themagical current was exhausted, although today the area is considered a focalpoint for UFO sightings, which some suggest has something to do with Crowley’sbeing there. Just before crossing the Atlantic, Crowley headed south to spendsome weeks visiting William and Kate Seabrook on their farm in Georgia. Crowleyclaims that, inspired by his presence, Seabrook tried to escape fromjournalism—he worked for the Hearst chain—and become an artist, but as soon asCrowley left, Seabrook reverted to type. We can, in a way, see Crowley’sinfluence on Seabrook as emblematic of his time in America. Crowley arrived andkicked up a storm, but as soon as he left, things reverted to normal. He was, headmitted, “too young, ignorant, and bigoted to make any impression on the UnitedStates.”1 [index_split_019.html#filepos813152] He reflected that his years therewere really preparation for what was to come. We may see Frank Harris’s remarkthat Crowley left America floating a string of bad checks as emblematic, too.Crowley arrived in London shortly before Christmas 1919. Even he was surprisedat the ease with which he passed through immigration. He had, after all, beenbranded a traitor, supporting the Hun and the Irish rebels. One would expect hewould have a little difficulty getting back onto British soil, but Crowleywalked into England without a hitch. Those who believe that he really had beenworking for British Intelligence cite this as evidence that the government wasbehind him. A perhaps more plausible reason is that Crowley was simply not takenseriously. England deals with chaps like him by ignoring them and that seems tobe what happened with Crowley.It was a bit of good luck amid many difficulties. The O.T.O. was broke, eitherthrough Crowley’s profligacy or George Cowie’s pilfering. Victor Neuburg avoidedhim; he had heard of Crowley’s return and quickly ducked for cover. A reunionwith George Cecil Jones proved disappointing; he had settled into comfortablenormality and Crowley loathed him for it. Crowley’s own health was ailing; hehad bronchitis and his asthma had returned; to battle it he obtained aprescription for heroin, which was still legal at that time. It was thebeginning of an addiction that lasted the rest of his life.For the two weeks he remained in England, Crowley was reduced to staying inCroydon with his aunt at the house he had berated the zeppelins for sparing. Itwas slightly ignominious, but Crowley must have appreciated the poetic justice.All during this time he consulted the I Ching, the ancient Chinese oracle, everyday, sometimes more, and would continue to do so—he would even produce his owntranslation of it—looking for some direction, although he was frequentlyuncertain as to why he did. On February 3, 1920, he was so confident that a “newCurrent or Word” would reach him that he didn’t “even seek an Oracle,” yet thenext day he did, “because I have literally nothing else to do.”2[index_split_019.html#filepos813306] His worldly affairs were not promising, butthe magical future looked good. Intimations of being an Ipsissimus, the lastgrade left on the Golden Dawn ladder of success, came to him. When he finallyachieved it, he would, as he wrote in Magick in Theory and Practice, be “whollyfree from all limitations soever,” not distinguishing between “one thing and anyother,” arriving at the indifferentism William James sagely backed away from.Such attainment, Crowley believed, “is insanity.”3[index_split_019.html#filepos813462] We may well agree, but to this theIpsissimus is also indifferent. How he could remain indifferent and yet hopethat others attained a similar state was a conundrum that still baffled him, yethe seemed to have achieved at least an indifference to this.One thing he was not indifferent to was that John Bull once again targeted him.His old enemy Horatio Bottomley had dug up dirt about his traitorous doings inAmerica and called for the government to take action. It was a libelous attackand George Cecil Jones urged Crowley to take legal steps, perhaps forgettingCrowley’s reluctance to do so against The Looking Glass. But Crowley had nomoney and it is unclear exactly what would have come out in court. Again, thosewho believe Crowley really was a British agent suggest that he refused to sue inorder to maintain official secrecy about his assignment. Yet a legal battleabout his affairs in America may have forced the government to take him moreseriously, with possibly unfortunate results. In any case the I Ching counseledlaying low. Crowley may have been forgotten during his sojourn in the States,but whether he liked it or not, he was once again back in the tabloid spotlightand, like his heroin addiction, the bad press would hound him for the rest ofhis life.John Bull may have ranted, but Crowley was no longer in England. He had headedto Paris, where he arranged for Leah, whom he called Alostrael and the Ape ofThoth, to meet him. She arrived with her bastard toddler Hansi, very littlemoney, and pregnant with Crowley’s child. She had been staying in Switzerlandwith her sister—they were Swiss born but their mother had brought them toAmerica to escape her brutal alcoholic husband—and the plan now was to get toNorth Africa, where the hot, dry air would help Crowley’s recovery. But firstCrowley had a reunion with Jane Chéron. He wanted to smoke opium with her andhave sex; neither was forthcoming but Jane offered something else. She hadembroidered in silk a copy of the stele of Ankh-F-N-Khonsu, the very one thathad revealed to Crowley his destiny, and she now gave this to him. For Jane todo this was unusual; she had shown no artistic inklings before. She had copiedit from an image in the Equinox some years back and Crowley took her unexpectedpresent as an indubitable sign that the Secret Chiefs were once again directinghis affairs. He looked for signs and he found them; as mentioned, Crowley had aknack for sparking synchronicities. He maintained that he had proven beyonddoubt the existence of “extra-human Intelligence,” and Jane’s gift was only moreevidence of this.4 [index_split_019.html#filepos813587]Crowley and the Ape of Thoth headed to Fontainebleau, where Crowley looked foran appropriate dwelling for Leah to have their child. Shipboard, Leah had madefriends with a French woman, Ninette Shumway, who had worked in America as agoverness but had tired of the place and was returning home. She had a son—herhusband had been killed in an accident—and Leah suggested that they invite herto join their growing family. Crowley had been performing several opera p.v.n.with Eliane, a local prostitute, and the idea of a ménage à trois appealed tohim. He even fantasized about a ménage à quarte, as he contemplated the arrivalof Jane Wolfe, a Hollywood actress who had been corresponding with him. He soonperformed opera with Ninette, asking the gods what to do. Like Leah, Ninette wasnot his usual type. She was thin, pale, lifeless, and listlessly dragged alongher equally lifeless “brat,” Howard—whom Crowley called Hermes. Crowley calledthem his patients and said his work of saving humanity would start with them.Crowley paints a romantic picture of his first opera with Ninette, with winegoing to their heads in a peaceful glade in the Fontainebleau forest, but he hadalready introduced her to the virtues of p.v.n., although this took some work.5[index_split_019.html#filepos813712] Crowley invariably overestimated his sexualpartners’ capacity for indifference; whatever the magical result of their union,the most obvious one was that Ninette hoped to oust Leah as Crowley’s partner.Ninette’s possessiveness manifested in Crowley’s dreams: a casebook Freudianscenario found him inside a cave that he recognized as Ninette’s yoni; there hehad a tandem bicycle without handles—a sign, perhaps, that he was losingcontrol.6 [index_split_019.html#filepos813875] Not long after this, on February26, 1920, Leah gave birth to Crowley’s third daughter. Mercifully she was namedAnn Léa, and quickly nicknamed Poupée. Perhaps out of spite or to keep up withLeah, Ninette, who soon took to the magical regimen, announced that she waspregnant; Crowley, in fact, performed opera to make her so. (Oddly, Crowley, whotook delight in lurid and scatological pornography, was offended by some ofNinette’s magical diary, in which she recorded in “brutal obscenity” the detailsof her workings with the Beast.)7 [index_split_019.html#filepos814031]Should they go to Algeria or the Italian lakes? Or Spain, Naples, or possiblyMarseilles? The idea of establishing a magical community in a warm climate whereCrowley could recover his health occupied the troupe, and Crowley repeatedlypetitioned the I Ching for some hint or clue. Some money from an inheritance wason its way—exactly how much is unclear, but thanks be to the Secret Chiefs!—andCrowley wanted to get things right. On March 1, after much deliberation andfilled with “contemptuous courage,” he finally decided on Cefalù, a smallfishing port some forty miles east of Palermo in Sicily.8[index_split_019.html#filepos814194] Leah and little Poupée decamped for London,where Leah would tidy Crowley’s business affairs, while the Beast, Ninette, herson, and Leah’s headed for Sicily. In Marseilles Crowley and Ninette performedan opus p.v.n. to ensure a safe journey, and on March 31 they arrived in Cefalù.After a terrible night in a wretched hotel, a realtor showed them the VillaSanta Barbara, a run-down farmhouse up a narrow path that wound around amountain on the outskirts of town. Crowley saw two Persian nut trees near theplace, just like the ones he had seen with Sister Virakam in Posilipo, and knewhe had found what he was looking for. With the money from his inheritanceCrowley and Leah later signed the lease, he as Sir Alaster de Kerval, she asCountessa Lea Harcourt.The Villa Santa Barbara had a magnificent view, west to Palermo, east to thesea, and was surrounded by a garden filled with flowers and fruit, with rollinggreen hills in the background. Nearby was the great rock of Cefalù, atop whichwere temples to Diana and Jupiter; on his second day there Crowley traversed therock and thanked the gods.9 [index_split_019.html#filepos814350] The farmhousewas soon christened the Abbey of Thelema, but it was also called the Collegiumad Spiritum Sanctum and, occasionally, the Whore’s Cell.10[index_split_019.html#filepos814883] Crowley ordered fancy stationery andbusiness cards with his title The Beast 666 and Leah’s The Scarlet Woman printedon them, with their address as the Abbey of Thelema, although it is doubtfulRabelais would have recognized the place. Crowley quickly turned the centralroom, from which the others radiated, into a temple. Here stood an altar onwhich The Book of the Law and the implements of magick were kept, as well as arecord of daily activities and visitors, much as in any guesthouse; around thisCrowley painted a dark red circle and blue pentagram. Crowley sat on a thronebefore an incense-burning brazier and around him were circled low stools wherehis flock would rest.He got to work adorning his La Chambre des Cauchemars (“chamber of nightmares”)with his paintings. One depicted a man being sodomized by Pan with his own seedcovering a naked Scarlet Woman. Others, of various couplings, followed suit.Crowley claimed that his erotic paintings neutralized sex so that his studentscould study it scientifically, yet his attitude toward it was anything butneutral.11 [index_split_019.html#filepos815359] In 1955, decades after Crowley’sdeparture, the sexologist Alfred Kinsey and the filmmaker Kenneth Anger removedthe whitewash with which the house’s owners had covered Crowley’s work. Althoughgiven high-sounding names, the property was rudimentary, without gas,electricity, sanitation, or plumbing and was barely furnished. As there was notoilet, Crowley’s thelemites met nature’s call as best they could and visitorsfound the place filthy, with a “foul miasma . . . stinking to high heaven.”12[index_split_019.html#filepos815962] No one cleaned. A Catholic housekeeper theyhad soon left, and no one cooked, that not being a part of their true will. Theslaves, Aiwass said, shall serve, but as yet none of them had turned up at theabbey.13 [index_split_019.html#filepos816117]Life at the abbey settled into a routine not unlike that at Christianmonasteries. Mornings began with Leah proclaiming the Law.14[index_split_019.html#filepos816466] Then they made the Kabbalistic Cross—partof the Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram—which was followed by a procession andthen an adoration to the sun. Similar adorations were made at noon, sunset, andmidnight, dedicated to the appropriate Egyptian god. Before meals they said,“Will”: “What is thy will?” “It is my will to eat and drink.” “To what end?”“That my body may be fortified thereby.” “To what end?” “So that I mayaccomplish the Great Work.” After supper Crowley read extracts from The Book ofthe Law, much as his parents had read from the Bible in his childhood. Duringthe day there was magical work, invocations, banishments, entreaties to one’sHoly Guardian Angel, disciplines such as Liber Jogorum, all recorded in precisedetail in one’s magical record, which the Beast perused regularly. The children,who had minimal supervision, must have found these rituals rather like being atchurch. Many who came to the abbey—bohemians and arty types, that generation’shippies—did not follow the regimen although Crowley himself was strict about it.Whatever we may think of him, he took his magick seriously.Unlike in monastic life, Crowley provided a variety of drugs for all who wishedto experiment. Cocaine, heroin, ether, morphine, opium, hashish, as well asalcohol and tobacco were at one’s fingertips. Crowley believed that addictionwas a fantasy bred by weak wills and that one could master drugs as one pleased.The Diary of a Drug Fiend, which presents an idealized and, at times, temptingpicture of his abbey—his depictions of the surrounding scenery contain some ofhis best writing, and the book itself was an advertisement for the place—isbased on the idea that through magick and thelema, one could learn to take orleave drugs as one willed. Crowley found to his dismay that this was not so, butDionysus and Hermes, Hansi and Howard, had no restrictions and both werefamiliar with alcohol and tobacco at a, for us, scandalously young age. Theywere also exposed to the sex rituals that were a regular part of thelemic life.Crowley believed this would save them from his own lingering sexual shame,which, although he had been eradicating it for decades, apparently stilltroubled him.For a time Crowley was happy, enjoying a serenity absent from his life—exceptfor his times in the mountains—and he wrote, painted, and thought of schemes tomake money and to further the work. At one point he even asked the I Ching if heshould turn the abbey into a tourist resort.15[index_split_019.html#filepos816739] He came as close as he ever had tosomething approximating a normal life, but the idyll did not last long. For onething Poupée was ill; from the beginning her grasp on life was weak. Crowley andLeah themselves suffered insomnia and Crowley recorded waking up in “absolutehorror” feeling a “nameless apprehension,” which he compared to Edgar AllanPoe’s “The Premature Burial.”16 [index_split_019.html#filepos816897] He and Leahalso experienced hallucinations or possibly poltergeists: he speaks of hearingfootsteps, raps, voices, and of sensing the “unauthorized presence . . . of astranger.”17 [index_split_019.html#filepos817088] Leah herself hallucinatedseeing Crowley in various parts of the house simultaneously. How much of thiswas due to the cocktail of drugs they took, to the magick they performed, tosheer anxiety, or to Crowley’s asthma is up for grabs.There were other problems, too. Even before arriving at the abbey, Crowley foundthat having two wives and their children constantly underfoot was something of astrain; at one point in Fontainebleau he was “ready to bolt to some countrywhere children are unknown.”18 [index_split_019.html#filepos817209] In Cefalùthings only got worse. On April 5 he “fiddled and spanked children”; what hemeans by “fiddled” is unclear, but he was consoled with the discovery of an“ugly girl with a big mouth.”19 [index_split_019.html#filepos817336] And hefound the sexual demands of having competing concubines too much even for him.On April 20 he looked forward to dictating a letter in order to “postpone sexualduties,” and wished Leah and Ninette were lesbians; their appetites, he said,would wear out any man’s lingham. Leah was open to the idea, but Ninette—whoCrowley called “Beauty” and also “Cypris” and who was, he said, a “candidate fora lunatic asylum”—rebelled and ran out practically naked into the rain. Crowleyfollowed, looking for her in the dark. By the time he brought her back, Leah hadgotten drunk and when she saw Ninette, started another fight; she later had ahysterical fit and vomited. Crowley retreated to his opium pipe. He required hisfollowers to live up to the saying that it is “never dull where Crowley is,” butthere must have been times when he wished they wouldn’t. Like many “free love”advocates, Crowley failed (or refused) to recognize that, like the “territorialimperative,” sexual jealously is simply a part of human nature and it is onlyrare indifferent individuals who can flit from partner to partner withoutbatting an eye. Leah invariably flared up if Crowley looked at another woman,and on one occasion Ninette, with an appalling lack of indifference, threatenedthe Beast with a revolver.Yet with two women already to contend with, Crowley looked forward to addinganother to his harem. The entries in the Magical Record anticipating the arrivalof Jane Wolfe make for somewhat cringing reading. Like an adolescent fan boy, hewas infatuated with her being a “movie star.” “I adore her name. I hope she isas hungry and cruel as a wolf . . . I have written three pages about her atthree o’clock o’ the morning; that is to say, Q.E.D. I love her . . .”20[index_split_019.html#filepos817463] Crowley’s late-night confessions werefueled by the cocaine he was inhaling in increasingly large amounts; it oftenproduced a Niagra of prose, with the infrequent gem amid the verbiage. He wassoon disabused of his romantic notions, but for a time he wallowed inmasochistic fantasies about Jane. On June 18, a month before her arrival,Crowley wrote “I drown in delight at the thought that I who have been Master ofthe Universe should lie beneath Her feet,” and he looked forward to being“splashed with the mire of her Triumph” and to choking as “her heel treads mythroat.”21 [index_split_019.html#filepos817590] These ecstasies of abasementsegued into fantasies of omnipotence: “I am drunk with the pride-absinthe that Iam great, the greatest man of my century, its best poet, its mightiest mage, itssubtlest philosopher.” He was “the self-crowned God whom men shall worship . . .for centuries”—this was “Fact steel hard”—and yet he wanted his “crown crushedby Her feet” and his face “fouled by Her spittle.”22[index_split_019.html#filepos817717]Jane’s arrival put a stop to all this. After a long and arduous journey and somemix-up over where to meet—first Bou-Saâda, then Tunis—on July 23, 1920, in theHotel des Palmes in Palermo, Jane was greeted by Leah, who proclaimed the Law.Her black dress was greasy and dusty, her face unwashed, her hair a mess, andher fingernails dirty. “Filth personified,” was Jane’s first impression and shewondered why Crowley had sent such an emissary. Crowley was equally disappointedon meeting Jane. She was not like her pictures and, he soon learned, had liedabout her horoscope. She was middle-aged and rather masculine, and photographsof her from Cefalù suggest a butch lesbian; her Hollywood claim to fame was apart in Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm with Mary Pickford. From the moment shearrived at the abbey she complained and Crowley found her a tough customer, buthe was determined to lead her to her true will. She suffered from the Hollywood“heebie-jeebies,” from affairs, bootleg gin, and veronal, and Crowley prescribeda simple but strict cure.23 [index_split_019.html#filepos817849] She wouldsubject herself to a month of meditation, living in a thatched lean-to, high onthe promontory, alone. Food and drink would be left for her, her only clotheswould be a woolen burnoose, and a lime pit latrine would meet her natural needs.Jane told Crowley he was crazy. He told her she could leave. She didn’t and shewas one of Crowley’s few successes. After a few days Jane became excruciatinglybored with the “sun, moon, stars, sky, and sea” that Crowley said she had toentertain herself with. Then she sank into apathy. But by the third weeksomething shifted and she felt a wonderful calm joy, a renewal of strength andcourage. Crowley knew instinctively that she was wound up by the Hollywood ratrace and had forgotten how to relax. He had forced her to do so and compelledher conscious mind to slow down and reconnect with her unconscious, which is thesource of “power, meaning, and purpose.” There was no magick, no opera, nodrugs, merely time and patience. After this Jane became one of Crowley’s mostserious and devoted followers. It is a shame that Crowley himself, who knew thistrick, forgot it when he most needed it.His masochistic fantasies, however, were not to be denied, and he directed themnow at Alostrael. He took a vow of Holy Obedience to her and she did not shirkthe task. To exorcize his physical cowardice, she took a lighted cigarette andpressed it to his chest. Then she attacked his ego. She saw through hisboastfulness over his erudition, his skill with languages, his drug taking, evenhis success with women. But the final humiliation hinged on his power totransmute the foul into the sacred, the antinomian alchemy on which he based hiswhole philosophy. She tested this by forcing him to eat her excrement.24[index_split_019.html#filepos818000] It did not go down well. His mouth burned,his throat choked, his belly retched, and the next morning they were not muchbetter. But he had proved himself to his Scarlet Woman.—THEIR FIRST SUMMER WENT WELL but by October things took a bad turn. Poupée didnot get better and Crowley experienced one of the few times when he was notMaster of the Universe. His forty-fifth birthday was his saddest yet, but twodays later he was sadder still when Leah returned from Palermo with the newsthat their child had died. They had taken her to the hospital there with hopesof saving her but the Secret Chiefs, it seemed, had decreed otherwise. Crowleywas never happy with the I Ching oracles he had received about his baby girl andnow she was gone, and he was truly shattered. This was not the last of theirtragedies. Leah was approaching term and having difficulties; Ninette, too, waspregnant. Soon after Poupée’s death, Crowley’s dog, christened Satan, was“murdered.” Then Leah miscarried. Leah believed Ninette had caused it by blackmagic and when Crowley read Ninette’s diary, he agreed. He was appalled by whathe read; the man who labored to revolt “every comparatively sane human being onearth” never dreamed such things were possible. He quickly excommunicated SisterCypris, banishing her to town until the birth of her own child by him. That theScarlet Woman to whom he had vowed obedience should fail to give Crowley an heirand that her rival should produce yet another daughter for Crowley—born onNovember 26 and named Astarte, after a temple prostitute Crowley had been in aprevious life—must have caused much pain.Crowley got over his loss by taking a magical retirement in Paris. There NinaHamnett, the Queen of Bohemia, introduced him to the mathematician andmusicologist J.W.N. Sullivan, who is one of the dedicatees of the Confessions;he is best known today for his book on Beethoven. Sullivan and Crowley hit itoff immediately and Crowley also took a liking to Sullivan’s mistress, adepressed woman named Sylvia, a talented musician who lacked self-esteem. LikeLeah, Ninette, and others, she was attracted to Crowley. While playing chess,Crowley discussed thelema with Sullivan and was so persuasive that themathematician soon pledged himself to find and do his true will. The best way todo that, Crowley suggested, was to leave Sylvia in his hands and go off on hisown. Sullivan did and Sylvia soon found that her true will was to becomepregnant by Crowley; at least she learned she was pregnant after her tryst withthe Beast. When Crowley said it was time to return to the abbey, expecting hisnew friends to join him, Sullivan demurred and took Sylvia back. Crowley didn’tcare but Sylvia was furious. Soon after this she died of typhoid but Crowley’sexhortations to Sullivan to find his true will had taken root. Shortly afterleaving Crowley, he began an impressive writing career with a book trying tounderstand his tragic affair with Sylvia.But the abbey had acquired one new recruit. In November Cecil Frederick Russell,who had met Crowley in New York and joined the O.T.O., arrived. He had readCrowley’s articles in The International and had been in correspondence with himsince. Russell had been thrown out of the U.S. Navy after injecting a huge doseof cocaine and attempting to burn a piece of glass through sheer will; herecounted this experiment in a strange book, Znuss is Znees: Memoir of aMagician, privately published in 1970. Russell, however, never really settledinto the abbey. Crowley found him coarse, brash, and, like himself,antiauthoritarian; he was especially annoyed at Russell saying “God damn!” aftersniffing ether. Russell adopted the name Frater Genesthai and was frankly putoff by the idea of performing p.v.n. on Crowley. But Crowley was determined tofurther Frater Genesthai’s education, and to this end it was his will to painthimself like some New Orleans whore in order to seduce his reluctant swain.25[index_split_019.html#filepos818276] “Come, seize me, master me, come, Bull ofmine, reach out and take me roaring,” he wrote in the Magical Record.26[index_split_019.html#filepos818431] But Crowley, who had trouble getting VictorNeuburg started, was not the beauty he once was, and Russell wasn’t turned on;Alostrael had to prime him per manu before the opus could start. Even etherdidn’t help and years later Russell wrote that Crowley’s enchantments simply“didn’t give me a bone-on.” Russell left the abbey after an argument and someyears later started his own magical society, the Choronzon Club, with ahodge-podge of rituals taken from the Golden Dawn and O.T.O.The argument with Russell was over the arrival of another recruit. FrankBennett, a bricklayer from Lancashire, had joined the A...A... and O.T.O. in1909 before emigrating to Australia; he had originally sought Crowley’s counselregarding the Abramelin magic and also about voices in his head. Bennett hadwritten to Crowley and, having had such success with Jane Wolfe, Crowley advisedcoming to the abbey, where Bennett would benefit from Crowley’s directinstruction, what he called “frying the seeds of the ego.” When Bennett arrived,Russell was asked to give up his room to the new brother, who outranked him inboth age and magick. Russell refused. Crowley then ordered him to do so. Russellrefused again. Crowley then suggested a holiday in Palermo. At this, Russellrushed off in a huff to the top of the rock of Cefalù, where he cooled his heelsuntil he finally decided to leave the abbey. But Frank Bennett, FraterProgradior (“I Advance”), was another story. Crowley said that his success withhim was enough to “wipe out a dozen failures.”27[index_split_019.html#filepos818598]I say it was Crowley’s success, but it was really Freud’s, and, as Crowley hadsaid about the best magick, Crowley himself didn’t know how he pulled it off.28[index_split_019.html#filepos818753] In essence, Crowley told Bennett that his“Real Self” was his unconscious mind. This, in reality, was his Holy GuardianAngel and the source of his true will, and he was cut off from it because herepressed its promptings out of society’s demands. This seems to contradict theidea that the Holy Guardian Angel, at least in the case of Aiwass, is an“extra-human intelligence,” but perhaps Crowley was making things easy forBennett. Crowley explained this as they walked to the beach for a swim. Bennettwas electrified with the insight and promptly tore off his clothes and dashedinto the sea; Bennett was in his midfifties and for him to sprint like a younggoat, as Crowley says, was unusual. As Crowley and the others swam, Bennettsplashed about, filled with a sense of tremendous new knowledge. Later Bennettasked Crowley to repeat what he said. Crowley couldn’t remember but Bennettinsisted, and Crowley traced over his remarks until he found the “winning shot.”What Crowley told Bennett was essentially Freud’s central idea: that we repressour natural instincts and desires because society demands we do, and because ofthis, we are neurotic. What we need to do, Crowley told Bennett, is to listen toour unconscious—our true will—and follow its desires. Failing to do so leads tosickness and dissatisfaction; the title of Freud’s book Civilization and ItsDiscontents says it all. William Blake had said it with characteristic brevitywell before either Crowley or Freud: “Sooner murder an infant in its cradle thannurse unacted desires” and “He who desires but acts not breeds pestilence.”Crowley’s desires were never unacted but Bennett, it seems, had spent most oflife repressing his. Bennett was so shaken by Crowley’s remarks that, accordingto Crowley, he entered a trance that lasted three days. Bennett’s own accountsuggests something more spectacular—Symonds quotes it at length—but, as in thecase of Jane Wolfe, in essence Crowley had turned Bennett’s mind toward theknowledge that he was something more than just his conscious mind, that therewas a whole other part of himself—perhaps the larger part—that he was ignoring.It should be noted that Crowley’s (and Freud’s and Blake’s) insight is, ofcourse, true, but is not the whole truth, and that the answer is not to simplyabandon the conscious mind in favor of the unconscious, which Crowley invariablydid, but to bring the two together, so that they support, rather than oppose,each other. (This was Jung’s central idea.) Crowley’s advice amounted to the1960s dictum to “Let it all hang out” or today’s “Just do it,” and for FrankBennett, a hardworking, highly disciplined, “self-made man,” relaxing andallowing the unconscious to open up was salutary. But as Crowley’s own lifeshows, letting the unconscious rip is not always fruitful. Yet Crowley triggereda positive reaction in Bennett and he was grateful. “I will spend the rest of mylife in spreading his teaching,” Bennett wrote. “For he alone led me to theknowledge of my real subconscious self . . .”29[index_split_019.html#filepos818880] Whether we like it or not, for all hisshortcomings, Crowley did have a positive effect on some people, and whatever wemay think of thelema, Crowley’s message did produce some beneficial results.This, however, was not the case with other visitors. Ninette’s sister Mimi, hertwin, was inclined to join in the activities (only her prudish upbringingprevented her) but her elder sister, Helen, was appalled and complained to theBritish Consul in Palermo about alleged illegal goings-on. The policeinvestigated but found nothing incriminating. Two writers Crowley had met inParis, Mary Butts and Cecil Maitland, also disapproved of what they tasted ofthelema. Mary Butts was a friend of Nina Hamnett’s. She was a novelist of meritand had a serious interest in the occult. She claimed that she went to Cefalùbecause she was interested in reaching the Fourth Dimension, an objectiveinspired by her reading Ouspensky.30 [index_split_019.html#filepos819045] Shefound life at the abbey hard; there was little food, privacy, or free time, andthe idea that her diary was open to all comers repelled her. The absence oftoilets was also a drawback. At first she believed “the Beast to be a technicalexpert of the highest order,” and like Crowley she and her lover Maitland usedhashish to facilitate astral travel; at the abbey they also added heroin totheir intake. But soon she found the abbey a “sham” and Crowley a “fanatic.”31[index_split_019.html#filepos819265] That Crowley used children in his sexualrituals—to what extent is unclear—disturbed her, and it may have been this thatappalled Ninette’s sister Helen.Crowley did not care for Mary. That she suggested how to transform the abbeyinto a “miniature university” put him off—women, we recall, were not supposed tohave ideas—but the real problem was Maitland.32[index_split_019.html#filepos819392] Crowley perpetually sought a reliablesuccessor—or at least magical heir—and had so far struck out. Maitland seemed alikely candidate. Like Neuburg, Maitland was talented and brilliant but, asCrowley noted, he lacked real will, and Crowley no doubt believed Butts wasresponsible for this. On their arrival in late June 1921, Maitland and Crowleywent for a swim, and Crowley did his best to drown his guest. Maitland escapedonto some sharp rocks, cutting himself badly in the process. Crowley may havebeen testing his capacity for domination à la Neuberg. The next day Maitlandplayed a prominent role in the ceremony of the Cakes of Light, the recipe forwhich can be found in The Book of the Law. Maitland baptized a cock, christeningit Peter Paul, while Leah, recapping Salome’s dance, demanded the bird’s head ona platter. The decapitated fowl’s blood was added to the ingredients.33[index_split_019.html#filepos819519] Meal is said to be the cakes’ mainingredient, but in Crowley’s Mass “the host is of excrement,” which theparticipants consume in adoration.34 [index_split_019.html#filepos819667] MaryButts found the offering unacceptable and remarked that on her arrival at theabbey, Crowley offered her “a goat’s turd on a plate.”35[index_split_019.html#filepos819842] Mary had a sense of humor equal toCrowley’s. During a ritual in which a goat was intended to copulate withAlostrael, the reluctant animal demurred, but was sacrificed anyway, its bloodsplattering the Scarlet Woman’s back. Leah, confused (and most likely drugged),asked Mary, “What should I do now?” and Mary replied, “I’d have a bath if I wereyou.”36 [index_split_019.html#filepos819997] It seems this episode finally putMary off Crowley.Mary wrote while at the abbey, and in Diary of a Drug Fiend Crowley depicts heras “a fat, bold, red-headed slut” and “white maggot” whose writing was “the mostdeplorable dreary drivel that had ever been printed.”37[index_split_019.html#filepos820148] He no doubt enjoyed that alliterativeassault but it would rebound on him disastrously. Mary and Cecil left the abbeyin September in ill health, bringing with them a heroin habit. Crowley, however,was not through with them. The following year, Leah visited the two in Paris.She said that if they didn’t give Crowley money, they would come to harm.Maitland handed her a hundred francs but evidently this was insufficient, andLeah cursed them. Two days later he took an overdose of Veronal, by accident ordesign or magick is unknown.38 [index_split_019.html#filepos820476]Yet all this should not have troubled the Beast. By 1921 he had reached the apexof his magical career. He was appalled by the enormity of the decision andfeared it would require some “insane act to prove his power to act withoutattachment.” What was left to do in this department is unclear; Crowley had beenacting without attachment for some time now. He gathered his forces and facedhis last challenge as an impossibilist. Crowley had reached the top of the Treeof Life. He was ready to become an Ipsissimus, 100 = 1empty square[images/00005.jpg], entering Kether, the first sephiroth emerging from thepositive nothingness of the Ain Soph Aur. What this was to free him from is,again, unclear. He was already beyond good and evil, right and wrong, and othersuch dualities and had achieved an unruffled indifference to everything aroundhim. No matter. He would invoke Insanity itself—even though he had alreadyinvoked it more than once. At 9:34 in the evening, Crowley became a god. “As aGod goes, I go,” he noted.39 [index_split_019.html#filepos820627] AlthoughCrowley swore to keep silent about this unthinkable achievement, the ScarletWoman, of course, was not so bound.Reflecting on his attainment, Crowley noted that he had exposed himself to thefull gamut of experience, to disease, accident, violence, to dirty anddisgusting debauches, to eating excrement and human flesh—which seems to addsubstance to the claims that he, at some point, cannibalized someone.40[index_split_019.html#filepos820815] But this amounted, he said, to a moralitythe severity of which surpassed any other because it was absolutely free fromany code of conduct.41 [index_split_019.html#filepos820970]One thing the Ipsissimus found it difficult to be unattached to was heroin. Hestarted taking it on his return to England in 1919, first for his asthma, thenfor pleasure, and then because if he didn’t, he suffered withdrawal; he sufferedsimilarly from cocaine. He was also very short of cash. In early 1922, after avisit to Paris with Leah—it was then that she hit up Mary and Cecil—Crowleyretreated to a hotel in Fontainebleau and tried to kick the habit. He went thereto beat the “storm fiend,” but also to get away from Leah; a distance wasgrowing between them. He had been taking three grains of heroin a day, sometimesfour or five, not to mention other drugs, and his health suffered. He stillbelieved he could free himself of the addiction, but confessed that he had“erred in going too far” and that the “worship has become forced.” To admit thatAiwass’s command to take strange drugs had been precipitate would undermine hiswhole life, but Crowley realized he needed help. He met with a Dr. Edmund Gros,who suggested Luminal and a sanitarium, but Crowley insisted on administeringhis own treatment; anything else would have been admitting defeat. His notebooksfrom this time are filled with the frequency, amount, and effects of the heroinhe was taking, as well as the horrors of trying to avoid it, with much wishfulthinking about how he could beat it; Crowley’s chronicle of his addiction may behis most lasting literary contribution. Crowley uncovered the dodges he workedto get past the guards at the gates of indulgence, but life without heroin washell. He needed it to get up and he needed it to get to sleep. He needed it,period.Another meeting with Leah in Paris proved depressing. He loved her, but thatlove was a curse. She, too, was addicted and she was exhausted from the rigorsof her office. But perhaps with another Scarlet Woman . . . ? Back inFontainebleau he asked Aiwass for direction. A young man, AugustineBooth-Clibborn, arrived at his door. He was interested in magick and Crowleyexpounded thelema to him exhaustively. Booth-Clibborn, Crowley explained, was toextract substantial sums from his parents, then head to Cefalù, where he wouldbe initiated into his new life.42 [index_split_019.html#filepos821092] But whenCrowley drew up his pledge, Booth-Clibborn, alarmed at Crowley’s repeatedrequests for money, declined. Crowley cursed Booth-Clibborn.—CROWLEY AND LEAH DECIDED to go to London. Both of them needed a break from theCollegium ad Spiritum Sanctum, and Crowley thought he could drum up somemuch-needed money there. But Crowley, who had been wearing his magical robesmost days at the abbey, realized he hadn’t a thing for the trip. In Paris hereclaimed some clothes he had left at a cleaners in 1914—it was magical theywere still there—and dressed in Highland gear (it was all he had), with his facepainted and no more than £10 to his name, the Ipsissimus and his consort madetheir way to cross the Channel.Near Boulogne he was mistaken for Gerard Lee Bevan, a financier wanted forembezzlement. The police removed his glengarry cap and black frizzy wig andbelieved they had caught their man. Crowley took it as a joke. He was a famouspoet and explorer and to prove it, he produced a photograph of himself in J.Jacot Guillarmod’s book on the Chogo Ri expedition—one time Crowley was thankfulfor the odious Swiss. In England he tried to retrieve copies of his books heldby the Chiswick Press, who claimed he owed a considerable sum in storage fees.The new owners were not sympathetic—Crowley claimed he had paid his bill—andCrowley had to cut his substantial losses. He tried to meet Captain Fuller atthe War Office but his old champion avoided him. He met with Gerald Kelly,hoping for a handout but also to discuss his daughter Lola Zaza, who, Kellyinformed him, was turning out like her father. They did not, it appears, discussRose. The apple does not fall far from the tree and Crowley was glad to hearthat at fifteen, Lola was unmanageable, ill tempered, and conceited. She,however, was not glad to see her father.The only paying work Crowley had ever performed—aside from training inthelema—was writing and he approached his friend Austin Harrison at the EnglishReview. Harrison commissioned some articles, which Crowley wrote underpseudonyms; Harrison could not publish them otherwise. In “The Great DrugDelusion” and “The Drug Panic,” Crowley argued that drug addiction was a myth;he even presented himself as a “New York specialist,” whose private clinicsuccessfully treated patients through “moral reconstruction.” Crowley’sideology, it seems, was getting the better of reality.Crowley fell out with Harrison but his expertise with drugs would come in handy.The novelist J. D. Beresford, an editor for the publisher William Collins, likedCrowley’s proposal for a sensational novel about drugs. There was a readershipfor books about the white slave trade; drugs and sex went well together, andCrowley could easily meet this requirement. Ostensibly the book would warnreaders to avoid drugs, but it would also be a wish-fulfillment fantasy in whichCrowley’s fictional alter ego would cure addicts through magick. He could alsoextoll the virtues of the abbey and encourage readers to travel there. With anadvance of £60—modest but sizable for the impecunious Ipsissimus—Crowley set towork. It was his first book that was not self-published.On June 4, 1922, in his room in the Kabbalistically significant No. 31Wellington Square, off the King’s Road in Chelsea, with Leah as scribe, Crowleystarted dictating The Diary of a Drug Fiend. He finished on July 1. For lessthan a month’s work it is an impressive achievement. Crowley dictated about fivethousand words daily; as a working writer I can confirm this is a hefty quota.Leah wrote in longhand and was shattered by the end. She coughed blood andfeared she had tuberculosis; after taking down Crowley’s 120,000 words, sheimmediately left for Cefalù. Their own addiction was going strong; the twoconsumed substantially as they produced a fairy tale about how drugs wereultimately harmless. The Diary of a Drug Fiend is not a good novel. It ramblesconsiderably, Crowley’s characters are cardboard—it is an unabashed roman àclef—his alliteration gets the better of him, and he is too easily drawn intosatirizing his enemies. But what it lacks in literary finesse it makes up for inimagination and dash; his account of the hell of addiction and his descriptionsof the Abbey in Telepylus (Cefalù) are, as mentioned, often striking. In 1972John Symonds annotated a paperback edition identifying all the characters. PeterPendragon, the protagonist who becomes addicted and comes to the abbey to becured, is based on Cecil Maitland. We’ve already mentioned Mary Butts’sdepiction. But the most revealing characterization is of Crowley himself. Heappears as King Lamus, otherwise known as the “Big Lion” (Great Beast). InHomer’s Odyssey King Lamus is the ruler of the Laestrygonians, a race ofcannibal giants. Lamus is, to put it bluntly, a superman. Those unable torecognize him as a genius fear and despise him, while those who can, revere andadore him. One gets the feeling that Crowley was saying this to himself for along time. When I first read the book in 1975 I knew nothing about Crowley’slife and accepted his idealized self-portrait at face value; it was, I admit,one of the reasons why I went on to pursue magick. Reading it again, knowingCrowley’s depressing and turbulent life, I find it often heartbreaking.Crowley’s unsatisfied hunger for recognition is simultaneously repellent andpoignant.Collins was so impressed with The Diary of a Drug Fiend that they commissionedCrowley to write an autobiography, what later became The Confessions of AleisterCrowley, giving him a £120 advance, twice as much as for the Diary. Crowleycould feel that finally, after all his toil, he would receive the recognition hedeserved; he could also feel confident that a modest income could be had fromhis pen—or Leah’s. When the book appeared in November, the literary reviews werenot glowing, but neither were they scathing. They were, all in all, respectfuland encouraging. For The Times Literary Supplement—London’s literary HolyGrail—the book teemed with an “amazing fertility of incidents and ideas” and wasrife with an “amazingly rich crop of rhetoric . . . and verbiage.” The Observerfound it had a “compelling power” in its “descriptions of degradation.” Yet notall were so tolerant.James Douglas, a columnist for the Sunday Express, had already attacked JamesJoyce’s Ulysses—for many years considered obscene—and Aldous Huxley’sinoffensive Antic Hay. Like de Wend-Fenton, Douglas was a self-proclaimed moralwatchdog, and Crowley’s novel made him growl. The Diary of a Drug Fiend was, hewrote, a “book for burning.” Douglas’s growls had increased sales for Joyce andHuxley, but such was not Crowley’s luck. The Express smelled blood and attacked.All the old mud came up and was slung at the Big Lion, and new revelations wereadded. Following Douglas’s attack, the Express launched an all-out assault,aided by an interview with Mary Butts. “Complete Exposure of ‘Drug Fiend’Author,” the banner read, “Black Record of Aleister Crowley.” Mary was handed anopportunity to retaliate for her portrait in the book and took it. She spoke of“profligacy and vice,” “bestial orgies”—the unfortunate goat—and otherdepravities. A woman, Betty Bickers, who knew Crowley, also revealed that he hadborrowed money from her that he never repaid. This supported the erroneouscharge that Crowley had stolen £200 from a widow. The “widow” was Laura Grahame,from whom he had extracted (exactly how remains ambiguous) the £100 with whichAllan Bennett had sailed to Ceylon. Other articles followed, accusing Crowleyof, among others things, running a prostitute ring in Palermo; it was untrue,but it was the sort of thing Crowley delighted in. Once again friends urged himto sue, but Crowley could not afford legal costs.The book quickly sold out its first run of three thousand copies, but Collins,cowed by the bad press, didn’t reprint and quietly let it fade away. They alsocanceled the Confessions, although Crowley did keep the advance. The irony isthat there is nothing obscene in The Diary of a Drug Fiend; Crowley, knowingwell the depths of addiction, depicted them sincerely, even if he was equallysincere about the delights of indulgence. It didn’t matter; he took a beating.Sensational half-true accounts about lurid sex and drug-filled rituals soldpapers. How much Crowley had himself to blame is debatable.While The Diary of a Drug Fiend was under attack, Crowley was in Cefalù,enjoying, to some degree, the publicity. As synchronicity would have it, on thevery Sunday—November 26, 1922—that the Express exposed the “orgies in Sicily,”Crowley welcomed a couple who would spell doom for the abbey. Crowley had metBetty May at the Café Royal in 1914. She didn’t like the Beast, but Betty’scareer was as checkered as his. She had grown up in a Limehouse brothel. Afterworking as an artist’s model in her teens, she had joined the Apaches in Paris,where she helped the gang relieve rich customers of their francs. She becameknown as the Tiger Woman and later returned to London and again took upmodeling; she was introduced to Crowley by the sculptor Jacob Epstein. LikeCrowley, she used cocaine and was a heavy drinker. She had already run throughtwo husbands and had hit thirty when she met Frederick Charles Loveday—a muchyounger man who liked to be called Raoul—and married him. Loveday was not herusual type. He had a first in history from Oxford, but Loveday also had a wildside. At Oxford he belonged to the Hypocrites Club, a society of thrill seekers,and Loveday seems to have been its leading light. He once climbed the Martyrs’Memorial to put a chamber pot on its top; on another occasion he fell from aroof onto a spiked railing that impaled his thigh. He also had a fascinationwith ancient Egypt and the occult and had read much of Crowley.Betty Bickers—who had unwisely loaned Crowley money—was putting up the Beast,who had left his room in Wellington Square. Crowley gave lectures at her place,and at one of these Betty introduced him to Raoul. Crowley took an instantliking to Loveday, sensing in him another Neuburg or Maitland. When he invitedRaoul to a private interview, Betty May tried to put him off. But Loveday washooked, and three days later he returned to Betty’s flat, his breath reeking ofether and with a strange look in his eyes. He had been astrally traveling withthe Beast the whole time and had only escaped by climbing out of the window anddown a drainpipe. A few days later Crowley turned up at their door in his kilt,wig, and lipstick—perhaps his failure with Russell made him take precautions—andinvited himself to dinner. As had Frances Gregg, Betty feared the worst.Crowley—an occult bully who liked threatening women—took note and told Betty shewould soon be cooking for him.When Loveday announced he intended to visit the abbey, Betty reluctantly agreed.Nina Hamnett, whom they met en route in Paris, tried to dissuade them, but Raoulwas determined. At Palermo they couldn’t afford the train to Cefalù and had topawn Betty’s wedding ring. Appropriately they reached the abbey at nightfall.Crowley, dressed in his magical robes, let Raoul pass, but Betty remainedoutside until she answered Crowley’s invariable greeting with “Love is the Law,Love under Will.” Loveday, christened Frater Aud (“Light”), took to the abbeyimmediately. Betty found it dirty, smelly, and unappetizing. Raoul started hismagical work eagerly. But Betty was made housekeeper—Ninette, who had performedthis function, was again pregnant. Part of Betty’s duties included cooking.Crowley had fulfilled his promise.A battle of wills began between the two. Betty broke the abbey rules at everyturn. She ignored Liber Jogorum and said “I” whenever she liked, but Loveday’sarms were soon covered in scabs from his infringements. Crowley ate with hishands and washed them before and after meals in a water bowl; Betty once pouredthis over his head. She also found Crowley’s frenzied Dionysian dancingamusing.43 [index_split_019.html#filepos821345] She was a tough cookie—runningwith the Apaches was no joke—and Crowley had his hands full, but, as Neuburg hadbeen, Raoul was under his spell. Betty feared that the drugs and rituals wereweakening Raoul. His health was already bad and meeting the demands of theMaster Therion did not help. By this time Crowley and Loveday both suffered froma liver complaint, possibly hepatitis, which is associated with drug use and canbe sexually transmitted. Crowley’s biographer Martin Booth suggests that Crowleycould have been infected and may have been an asymptomatic carrier.44[index_split_019.html#filepos821576]The end came after a ritual involving a cat. Strays littered the abbey andCrowley said they housed evil spirits. In February 1923, one evil spirit, calledMischette, was found under the dinner table, and when Crowley hauled her up, shescratched his arms, performing an unscheduled Liber Jogorum on the MasterTherion. He was not amused. Crowley announced that Mischette had to besacrificed and that it was Loveday’s will to do it. Betty May had taken a likingto Mischette and this may have had something to do with what followed.The story is that Crowley made a pentagram over the beast and commanded that itremain on the spot, and it did. The truth was that Crowley anaesthetizedMischette with ether and put her in a sack. Loveday then recited a longincantation holding the drugged cat with one hand and a Gurka knife withanother. Drawing the blade across the ill-fated feline’s throat, Loveday botchedit and the cat, now awake, bolted, showering the room with blood. Mischette wascaught again and again drugged. This time her blood poured into a silver cup,which Crowley offered to Loveday, commanding him to drink. He did.Soon after, Loveday fell ill and at first Betty blamed that cup of cat’s blood.But earlier that day the two had hiked and as it was hot, Loveday had drunk froma mountain spring. Crowley had warned them not to drink the spring water—it waspossibly infected by settlements higher up the mountain—but Loveday’s thirstoverruled the Beast. Ironically, the one time that Loveday went againstCrowley’s commands proved fatal to him, possibly. The doctor first diagnosedhepatitis, but as Loveday worsened, this changed to acute gastroenteritis,possibly from infected water; the doctor may have been lax in his duties as hewas having difficulty getting paid. But the complaint could also have come fromthe cat’s blood; it may have had bacteria in its throat. Another possibility isthat Loveday was allergic to cats. Raoul quickly worsened and on February 14 hedied, at the time Crowley had predicted. Crowley had again lost his magical heirand was crushed; he had truly liked Loveday. He performed a solemn thelemicfuneral service, reading from The Book of the Law and his verse play The Ship.Crowley took ill immediately afterward and remained bedridden for weeks.Loveday’s remains were later exhumed by his parents and brought back to England.Betty May received help from the British consul and soon after Raoul’s deathreturned to London. She told her story to some reporters from the Sunday Expresswho were delighted with it. On February 25 Crowley again made the headlines:“New Sinister Revelations of Aleister Crowley. Varsity Lad’s Death. DreadfulOrdeal of Young Wife.” The Express pulled out all the stops and went for Crowleywith a vengeance. Betty and Raoul—who were not named—had been “trapped in aninferno, a maelstrom of filth and obscenity.” Raoul fell ill because of theabbey’s unsanitary conditions. The facts about the abbey were “too unutterablyfilthy to be detailed in a newspaper,” but the Express did its best. Childrenwere forced to witness depraved sexual rites. Crowley, saturated with drugs,idled in a room hung with obscene pictures. And so on.John Bull joined in, pumping up a flagging circulation with the headlines “TheKing of Depravity,” “A Man We’d Like to Hang,” and, most notoriously, “TheWickedest Man in the World.” Betty May was not the “innocent young wife” she wasportrayed as—nor was she the “Angel Child” as reported in the United States—andshe later admitted that it was most likely the infected water that had killedLoveday (although, had he not been weakened by drugs and the exertions of histrue will, he may have survived; we simply don’t know). Crowley had also notcannibalized two porters in the Himalayas, as the newspaper claimed nor hadspirits counseled him to sue the Express for £5,000 to fund a new, larger abbeyelsewhere. He did envision a grander, glass-domed abbey, and at one pointapproached his landlord, the Baron la Calce, as a prospective investor. Thebaron declined, but he did not refuse performing occasional opera with Alostraelwhen Crowley was away. It is true that the mud slung at Crowley was libelousand, had he the resources, he may have won a case against his slanderers. Butthen, had he been less threatening to Betty May, she may have been less eager togive his detractors ammunition—we remember Mary Butts. We may also consider thata “religious leader” and “major thinker of the age” who resorts to bestiality,animal sacrifice, substance abuse, sadomasochism, and promiscuity might find itdifficult explaining why modern man needs these in order to find his truewill.45 [index_split_019.html#filepos821727] Crowley was unjustifiably accusedof many things. But he had no qualms about skating over the abyss, orreservations about those less sure-footed who followed him.Someone who took the Express’s sinister revelations seriously was Italy’s newruler, Benito Mussolini. The mud had reached the European papers and Il Duce wasalarmed. Mussolini was cracking down on secret societies of all sorts, hittingFreemasons and Mafiosi indiscriminately. He also wanted to gratify the church.An anti-Christian, drug-addicted, sex-obsessed magician was not what Sicilyneeded just then. On April 23, 1923, the local commissario of police servedCrowley a deportation order. Cannily, Crowley noticed that only his name wasmentioned. Reluctantly, the authorities agreed that his fellow thelemites couldstay; some did, Ninette for another three years. Crowley, however, had to leave.A week later Crowley and Leah left the Collegium ad Spiritum Sanctum forPalermo, where they caught a ship for Tunis. Many of the locals regretted hisgoing. He had livened up the place and they signed a petition, organized by JaneWolfe, asking for him to remain. They may have crossed themselves as they passedthe abbey, but after all, he had caused no real harm and had brought many peopleto the place. For years after Crowley’s departure the abbey remained empty andabandoned. More recently, as noted, it has been featured in tourist brochures,and as of 2006 was up for sale, at the price of £1.2 million."},{"pageContent":"NINEWANDERING IN THE WASTELAND> [images/00004.jpg] Norman Mudd, mathematician, was not the luckiest of men. Ever since backing downfrom the Dean of Trinity College over his association with Crowley, Mudd hadfelt a coward. Relocating to South Africa, he became the head of appliedmathematics at Grey University College, Bloemfontein; he also contractedgonorrhea and lost the sight in one eye. This did not help his appearance; Muddwas short, unattractive, and snub-nosed. Shame dogged him and in 1920 hereturned to England in search of Crowley. Failing to find him, he headed toDetroit—the Blue Equinox pointed him there—where he met Frater Achad. He did notmeet Mudd’s needs but it was through him that Mudd again came into contact withhis master, who promptly asked him for money and suggested he join the faithfulin Cefalù. Again Mudd’s nerve failed him; in the spring of 1921 he retreated toSouth Africa. Followers of gurus often vacillate, however, and after rereadinghis correspondence with the Beast, Mudd once again contacted Crowley. This timehe was sure. He resigned his post, emptied his savings—which he soon gave toCrowley—and headed for Cefalù. He arrived the day after Crowley received hiseviction notice from Mussolini.1 [index_split_019.html#filepos821955]Undeterred, Mudd became Crowley’s secretary. While the Beast and his ScarletWoman hightailed it to Tunis, Mudd remained behind with Ninette. Crowleyactually put him in charge; of what is unclear. Mudd wrote a panegyric toCrowley that was published in an Oxford student magazine called Isis in November1923. Crowley’s ideals were “noble” and his honor “stainless.” Yet why England’s“greatest poet” was subject to “baseless” vilification Mudd did not explain.This encomium was as successful at clearing Crowley’s reputation as was anotherthat Mudd had written, under Crowley’s direction, his Open Letter to LordBeaverbrook, published in 1924 in a pamphlet distributed to literary lights.Beaverbrook owned the Sunday Express, which had raked Crowley over the coals.Crowley could not openly defend himself, and Mudd became Crowley’s bulldog muchas Captain Fuller had been.Meanwhile Crowley cooled his heels at the Hotel Au Souffle du Zéphir in Tunis, abudget establishment. Here he dictated his Confessions, battled his drugaddiction, worried about money, and felt a lack of interest in Leah, who againserved as his scribe. His diaries from this time are free of sexual opera and hesuffered from impotence, either from drugs, his attempt to kick them, or sheerboredom, which afflicted him frequently. Leah was his most faithful follower andhe had sworn a holy vow of obedience to her. Nevertheless her “mere presence—notanything she does—disturbs.”2 [index_split_019.html#filepos822742] It did notdisturb him enough to avoid using her as an amanuensis, but it was becomingclear that Leah’s days as the Scarlet Woman were numbered.Collins had canceled the contract for the Confessions, yet Crowley wasdetermined to get his life down on paper. Some urgency compelled him, or thecocaine to which he was psychologically addicted necessitated some vocaloutflow. Or he may simply have needed some activity to keep him from fallingapart. He seems to have entered a period of denial. He had been booted out ofCefalù, yet he considered the abbey a success and dreamed of starting again at amore suitable location. This, of course, was a pipe dream. The only activitygoing on at the abbey was Ninette’s giving birth to another daughter, this timeby Baron la Calce, who sometimes performed opera in lieu of receiving rent. OnMay 19, the day of baby Isabella’s birth, Crowley confided thoughts of suicideto his diary. Some weeks later he also entered black thoughts of depression atthe failure of the abbey. He doubted if he was a great magician, yet he alsoproclaimed that although he may be a black magician—a damning admission—he was“a bloody great one.”Much of this Sturm und Drang was self-pity. Crowley thought he was a washout andwould disappoint any new students. Drugs were to blame. A cure might work, butit could leave him “a shadow of my former self.” “Why drag out a useless life,dishonoring my reputation, discrediting my methods,” he asked.3[index_split_019.html#filepos822899] “Suicide should not be taken as anindication of failure,” he mused, but of the “determination to be done with aworn out tool, or to make way for new ones, or (perhaps) to get a new oneoneself.”4 [index_split_019.html#filepos823024] He had, after all, seen badtimes before, in his previous incarnations. How well his Ipsissimusshipweathered this buffeting the reader can decide, but Crowley came very close toadmitting he had made some mistakes. “It is possible, even probable,” he wrote,“that a man may be misled by the enthusiasms of an illumination.” “People . . .may be expected to get themselves into all those kinds of trouble which resultfrom uncritical enthusiasms about the ‘revelations’ which are made to them.”5[index_split_019.html#filepos823144] If this is so, they should, he reflected,“unhesitatingly stick to the course that ordinary decency indicates.” Again, thereader must decide if Crowley followed his own advice. Other thoughts also cameto him. “If a man fucks a woman,” he reflected, “he admires heraesthetically . . . When a man fucks me I want to know it is for my beauty,”something that had escaped Cecil Russell. Crowley thought of heading to Cairowith Captain Fuller to steal the Stele of Revealing from the museumthere—exactly what he would do with it he left uncertain. He wrote to KingGeorge V suggesting he initiate a religious crusade; at the same time he wroteto Leon Trotsky advising that he should be made the head of a movement toabolish Christianity. Those familiar with Nietzsche’s last days of semisanitybefore his final plunge into madness will recall a similar megalomania.To free himself of his malaise, in late July Crowley decided to take a magicalretirement at the Tunisia Palace Hotel, the most expensive place in town. Herehe took as a lover a young boy named Mohammed he had found in a souk. He stayeduntil October. Most likely Crowley paid for this with Mudd’s money. Leah did notaccompany him. She remained at the Hotel Au Souffle du Zéphir where on June 20she was joined by Mudd. Leah left for Cefalù the next day, but when she returnedin August, an odd thing happened: Leah and Mudd fell in love. To economize, theyshared a room at the cheap hotel and, quite naturally, magick took its course.Mudd proposed marriage, believing that if he and Leah were wed, she couldfulfill her role as the Whore of Babalon more fully by sleeping with Crowley.This flawless logic did not please the Beast, who forbid their union. He was nolonger interested in Leah but he still needed her help, although he would be thelast to admit it. (He had, as well, confused thoughts about her. Concerned forLeah’s health, he wrote to her sister Alma, asking her to come to take care ofLeah and to take Hansi from Cefalù, where he remained with Ninette, Howard, andIsabella. Yet when Alma had arranged the trip, Crowley ordered Ninette to barher from the abbey and any access to Hansi.) Crowley did not want Leah, but hecould not let her go. He convinced Mudd that he was not really in love with Leahand sent him off on a magical retirement of his own; he would have some ofCrowley’s Confessions to study. Meanwhile, with Leah and Mohammed, Crowley setoff on another magical retirement, this time in the desert. (He had somedifficulty paying his bill at the Tunisia Palace, but seems to have surmountedit.) On the sands near Nefta, a pilgrimage site, Crowley and Mohammed smokedhashish and performed opera, as did Mohammed and Leah. But this retirement was adisaster; after a few days the three fell ill and returned to Tunis. Whilerecovering Crowley wrote a pamphlet criticizing Mussolini and worked on acommentary about The Book of the Law.Crowley was glad to see 1923 end; it had not been a good year. On December 29,he determined that the magical currents in Tunis had waned and it was necessaryto relocate. He wrote to the owner of the Hôtel de Blois in Paris, his favoritepied-à-terre, assuring him that The Diary of a Drug Fiend had been a success andthat he would soon pay him the two thousand francs he owed from his last visit;Crowley often comes across like Dickens’s Mr. Micawber, perpetually awaitingsomething to “turn up.” His assurances must have worked; commandeering whatmoney there was, Crowley fled from Tunis heading for Marseilles, leaving Leahand Mudd holding a very empty bag. His Scarlet Woman and chief defender wereabandoned, penniless, and not a little confused.—CROWLEY’S OSTENSIBLE PLAN was to collaborate with Frank Harris on buying aParisian newspaper, the Evening Telegram, another pipe dream intended to bringin cash. In Nice, Harris lent Crowley five hundred francs for the train toParis; Harris was also broke and looking for work, and had to borrow it himself.The plan was a nonstarter from the beginning and when Harris asked Crowley forthe money back, unsurprisingly Crowley explained that he couldn’t pay but alsoinformed Harris that he, Crowley, had been handpicked by the gods to initiatethe new post-Christian era for mankind. If Harris would only join in thiscampaign, all of their problems would be solved. Immediately this meantsupporting Crowley in his proposed trip to London, where a lawsuit against theSunday Express would attract those few who were ready to “assume Kingship andrule the disorganized and bewildered mob.”6 [index_split_019.html#filepos823269]Crowley assured Harris his plan would succeed because his speeches in courtwould be prophetic. Harris, who really needed his five hundred francs, was notconvinced.To maintain himself in Paris, Crowley pawned his magical jewels, bell, andsword, as well as a fur coat and a cigarette case. He believed in the SecretChiefs and his mission, but for a moment doubted himself. On January 13, 1924,he confessed that he had no strength left and no interest in anything. It was aneffort to get out of bed and a challenge to dress. He wanted to die, to be takeninto the bosom of the saints, far beyond these earthly tribulations. Had he everdone anything of value? Was he merely a wastrel, a coward, a trifler—in otherwords, was he as those who criticized him believed? “Guilty” came the starkreply.7 [index_split_019.html#filepos823423] He had by now given up the idea ofcuring himself of his drug addiction, and it is possible that Crowley’smuch-discussed visit to Gurdjieff’s Prieuré in Fontainebleau in early February1924 was in order to see if Gurdjieff would take him on as a patient. Gurdjieffhad at different times earned money curing addicts and alcoholics throughhypnosis; Crowley could have visited the Prieuré with this in mind.8[index_split_019.html#filepos823585] Different accounts, by C. S. Nott,Gurdjieff’s student, and James Webb, his biographer, tell different stories, butthe only record by Crowley of his visit states that he went there in order tosee if he could take on any pupils with whom Gurdjieff had “failed,” a curiousnotion.9 [index_split_019.html#filepos823788] Crowley didn’t meet Gurdjieff—atleast he doesn’t mention meeting him—either because he was not at the Prieuré orbecause Gurdjieff did not wish to see Crowley. Crowley did meet Frank Pinder,whom he considered a “hell of a fine fellow.” Pinder convinced Crowley thatGurdjieff was a “tip-top man” and a “very advanced adept,” although Crowley tookargument with his ideas about sex.10 [index_split_019.html#filepos824962]Gurdjieff believed that a normal sexual life was necessary for “work ononeself,” but that the sexual irregularities that Crowley pursued weredetrimental to it.11 [index_split_019.html#filepos825089]—BY THIS TIME Leah had escaped from Tunis and returned to Cefalù. She managedthis by pawning Crowley’s magical ring, which raised eighty-four francs. ButMudd remained until Crowley, receiving money from Leon Engers Kennedy,surprisingly sent him some to come to Paris. Mudd soon did, leaving a wake ofunpaid bills. What he told Crowley of Cefalù was not good. Everyone was facingeviction because of unpaid rent; the Baron had had his fill of opera and wantedto sell the place. Crowley needed to move his belongings, especially hislibrary, and the faithful Mudd arranged for this to be shipped to England. Thiswas a mistake: it was on this occasion that, as mentioned earlier, Crowley’sbooks were seized by customs and destroyed. Crowley then sent Mudd to London ona fund-raising mission. Jane Wolfe was already there, working at a nursing home;of all the crew at Cefalù, she seems the most together. Mudd was not successful;he wound up having to enter a homeless shelter to get a bed for the night.12[index_split_019.html#filepos825263] During this trip Mudd appealed to peoplesuch as Bertrand Russell, Bernard Shaw, and the philosopher Miguel de Unamunowith his Open Letter to Lord Beaverbrook; he also appealed to the anarchist EmmaGoldman. She doubted Crowley was as persecuted as Mudd alleged, as she hadrecently seen him at a Parisian café, surrounded by friends.13[index_split_019.html#filepos825484] The friends may have been George CecilJones, J.W.N. Sullivan, and the Argentine artist Alexander Xul Zolar, who hadsought out Crowley for magical instruction. The three brought cash, food, andcompanionship. While his followers fended for themselves as best they could,Crowley always managed to land on his feet.Leah arrived from Cefalù in late March. She was not happy with the Beast. He hadleft her and Mudd destitute and had ignored their pleas for help. Indeed,Crowley’s missives to Mudd were vitriolic. Mudd had had the temerity to suggestthat their current crises arose because Crowley was avoiding the obligationsgiven him by The Book of the Law. Typically, Crowley turned on Mudd; that heconsidered him “less than a mollusk” suggests his level of vituperation.14[index_split_019.html#filepos825639] When Mudd, who was still in love with Leah,told Crowley it was his destiny to marry her, Crowley replied that Mudd couldbest fulfill his magical tasks by getting a job, saving money, insuringhimself—with Crowley as beneficiary—and committing suicide. This was, alas, ajoke that would soon be in earnest.15 [index_split_019.html#filepos825766]On May 1 the understanding proprietors of the Hôtel de Blois sold the place. Thenew owner was less thelemically inclined and Crowley and Leah were booted out.Crowley promptly cursed him and the hotel allegedly soon went bust. Crowley hadhad two nose operations earlier in the year—sniffing heroin and cocaine dailyhad ravaged his sinuses—and his doctor had advised entering a nursing home. Thenext best thing was Chelles-sur-Marne, a quiet village on the outskirts ofParis. Here they stayed at the inn Au Cadran Bleu and passed a quiet summer.Crowley continued to dictate his Confessions and passed on his occult wisdom toAlexander Xul Zolar. Then the inevitable happened.Dorothy Olsen was American, thirty-two, and neurotic. She was also seekingmagical instruction and was willing to pay for it. She was touring Europe and inAugust 1924 found her way to Crowley’s door. She was attractive, blond, and fullof life. Leah, at forty-one, was haggard, weary, and looking it. The SecretChiefs, it seemed, had plans for Dorothy. They did not include Leah. Dorothy wasquickly initiated into the A... A... and christened Soror Astrid. Soon after,and much to Leah’s dismay, Crowley announced that in their wisdom the SecretChiefs had decreed that he and Dorothy should take a magical retirement—alone.The unthinkable had occurred. Leah was no longer the Scarlet Woman.After a romp in Paris, on September 23 Crowley and his new consort headed forMarseilles from where they crossed the Mediterranean to Tunis. Crowley informedLeah that he did not know when he would see her again. His only remark about herreaction was the terse note that she had collapsed.16[index_split_019.html#filepos825887] Leah was abandoned again, and again waspenniless. She was also ill and addicted. This, sadly, was not the only blow. Atelegram from Ninette informed her that her sister Alma had gained custody ofHansi and was taking him to America.17 [index_split_019.html#filepos826014] Leahtried to regain custody but the American embassy would not help. To make mattersworse, she was thrown out of her hotel; her belongings littered the street,although her sympathetic landlady gave her a chair to sit on. Norman Muddreturned from London and shared her misery; the two tramped through Paris,starving, dressed in rags. Together these thelemic orphans united and, ignoringCrowley’s admonitions, magically married in a ritual Leah had devised. To earn acrust the former Scarlet Woman and Whore of Babalon was reduced to washingdishes at a Montparnasse café. Mudd pawned what he could and importuned hisparents for money. Leah prostituted herself to make ends meet; sex was businessnow, not magick. Her letters to Crowley were ignored, her pleas for helpunanswered; the only words she heard from the Beast were complaints. The curseof Aiwass, it seems, had struck again. Or was it Aiwass’s curse? Both Mudd andLeah’s main concern was that Crowley was ignoring his responsibilities as theword of the aeon. Unbelievably, they were still believers, for a time.Crowley meanwhile enjoyed the Tunisian sun and, inspired by Soror Astrid, heagain took to poetry. On the voyage from France, he composed a manifestoentitled To Man. It later formed a part of The Heart of the Master (1925), akind of spiritual autobiography. To Man was aimed at dissuading the theosophistAnnie Besant from proclaiming her and Bishop Charles Leadbeater’s protégé, JidduKrishnamurti, as the long-awaited World Teacher, the avatar of the new age whowould lead mankind out of chaos. That role, clearly, belonged to the MasterTherion. Crowley needn’t have worried; Krishnamurti declined the position in1929.18 [index_split_019.html#filepos826741] Crowley’s other literary activitywas composing begging letters, mostly aimed at Dorothy’s family. While Leah andMudd starved and struggled, Crowley used the money he got to fashion a magicaljewel for his new flame’s forehead. He also journeyed through the desert andenjoyed a feast laid out by a sheik who—so Crowley said—recognized him as aSecret Chief. He also performed important opera, mostly with Dorothy butsometimes XI0. By this time Leah had achieved a certain distance from and ironyabout the Beast, answering his letters—which only contained magicalinstructions, never offers of help—using his initials, “A.C.,” and not“Beautiful Big Lion” as she once had.Yet she still was at his beck and call. In March 1925, Leah dropped her dishesand headed to Marseilles, en route to Tunis. After an arduous winter in Europe(spent mostly in Paris), the Big Lion and little Dorothy had returned to Tuniswhere they discovered that Dorothy was pregnant. Leah was required to help. Andnot only with the pregnancy. Dorothy was causing trouble. Her health was bad—shewas not used to the drugs that invariably accompanied Crowley’s magick—and shewas giving the Beast a hard time, so hard that he was compelled to give her ablack eye, shattering her cheekbone in the process. She returned fire,scratching Crowley’s face as he slept. But it was a false alarm. Dorothymiscarried and Crowley and she headed for France. Leah remained in Tunis.It was a kind of closure. There, again in poverty, again abandoned, Leahregained something of her own self, her own will. Eventually she renouncedCrowley, both the man and the magician; her addiction to him she labeled“A.C.–itis” and she got over it. From Switzerland in 1929 she circulated aletter disclaiming her role as the Scarlet Woman. Crowley had by then forgottenher but he was disturbed enough to tell his followers to avoid her like theplague, yet he still asked her to provide evidence that Mudd had stolen some ofhis property; people were always stealing from him. In desperation the lucklessmathematician had sold some of Crowley’s books and kept a pittance as acommission. She refused. Mudd, too, eventually renounced Crowley, and for a timethought of himself as the new World Teacher. And, as if in fulfillment ofCrowley’s sardonic advice that he commit suicide, Mudd met his end in 1934 bydrowning himself off the Isle of Guernsey. He filled his trousers with stones,tied them off with bicycle clips, and walked into the sea.19[index_split_019.html#filepos826898] Leah’s end was not so tragic. According toSymonds, she eventually returned to America where she again took up teaching;she died in 1951.—ONE OF CROWLEY’S FIXATIONS was a prophecy in The Book of the Law concerning a“rich man from the west” who would solve all of his financial problems. In thesummer of 1925 he seemed to have turned up. After Theodore Reuss suffered astroke in 1922, Crowley was determined to become the head of the O.T.O. The twohad fallen out in 1921, but Crowley claimed that before Reuss died in 1923, heappointed him O.H.O.—Outer Head of the Order. Crowley offered no proof of thisand the German members were not happy with his leadership. To fill the gap,Heinrich Tränker, otherwise known as Frater Recnartus, who led a group known asPansophia, was made temporary head of the order.20[index_split_019.html#filepos827207] In 1924, Tränker had a vision in which hesaw Crowley as the World Teacher and he invited the Beast to an O.T.O.convention held in Hohenleuben, a small town in Thuringia near the Czech border,to discuss his possible leadership. Crowley, Dorothy, Leah, and Mudd had theirfares paid by Karl Germer (Frater Saturnus), a well-heeled and well-educatedmember. Germer also paid off Crowley’s debts in Paris. He was to become one ofCrowley’s main benefactors for the rest of his life. The rich man had arrived.Germer told Crowley that he was sexually confused and had never reachedsatisfaction with a woman. He fantasied himself as a hermaphrodite and had nounderstanding of magick. Crowley, of course, soon sorted that out.Crowley sent a copy of The Book of the Law ahead of the conference, to betranslated into German. This proved a mistake. We’ve seen how some O.T.O.members reacted to his rewriting of their rituals. Tränker read Das Buch desGesetzes and was appalled. Other members agreed: it was demonically inspired.Albin Grau, an artist and the production designer for F. W. Murnau’s classicvampire film Nosferatu (1922)—Grau introduced much occult symbolism into thefilm—believed that Crowley’s philosophy presaged a “primitive world order”suggesting the “blackest days of Atlantis.”21[index_split_019.html#filepos827448] But then Tränker had a second vision inwhich he saw that Crowley’s book encapsulated the idea of “civilization,” acurious assessment indeed. He then supported him, although relations between thetwo remained tense. The conference split into pro- and anti-Crowley camps, butat the end Crowley’s position as O.H.O. was secure. Leah and Mudd also benefitedby the journey. The elderly Martha Küntzel, a theosophist who had known MadameBlavatsky, allowed them to live with her for a time in Leipzig; it was here thatLeah gave birth to a boy she had by William George Barron, a disciple who stayedaround long enough to get her pregnant. It was after this meeting that Leah andMudd gradually came to terms with Crowley’s fickleness. Küntzel herself became afanatical Hitlerite and fell out with Crowley over this.It was also after this meeting that Dorothy’s position as Scarlet Womancrumbled. The two returned again to Tunis, where Crowley wrote his enigmatic“Comment” on The Book of the Law, which states that the “study of this Book isforbidden” and that those who discuss it are to be “shunned . . . as centers ofpestilence.” That Crowley did both goes without saying. One reader of thesereflections was Crowley’s friend and biographer Charles Richard Cammell, whoseson, Donald Cammell, directed the dark hippie film Performance (1970), starringMick Jagger.22 [index_split_019.html#filepos827603] Crowley advised that “it iswise to destroy” the book “after the first reading.” Cammell, appalled by TheBook of the Law, threw his inscribed copy into the fire. One of Dorothy’s lastservices to Crowley was to write to Henry Ford, explaining that his oppositionto organized labor was in keeping with the ideals of thelema. By October 1926,she was history. Like Rose, she eventually became an alcoholic. Reports are thatshe drank herself to death in 1930.Back in Paris and free of Dorothy, Crowley used Karl Germer’s money to live inthe style he was accustomed to, taking a flat at 55 avenue de Suffren. Germertolerated Crowley’s profligacy, but his wife was less forbearing. She wrote tothe Beast complaining that the money she had given him was spent on “expensivecigars, cognac, cocktails, taxis, dinners, . . . anything you desired at themoment,” and suggested that “God Almighty himself” would not have been asarrogant.23 [index_split_019.html#filepos827804] Crowley ran through potentialScarlet Women, candidates his rigorous screening process soon eliminated. At onepoint he claimed to be juggling six white and three black mistresses. One inparticular, Margaret Binetti, he became engaged to, but jettisoned in February1927, burning a Jupiter talisman that, he claimed, protected her. He also hadthe occasional XI0 encounter. He was past fifty, drug addled, ill, overweight,bald—he had given up wearing wigs and had settled into his shaven-head look—histeeth were bad and his breath reeked of ether; it was one of Leah’s fewcomplaints about his personal hygiene. Yet he was still able to attract women.He was also able to attract men. One was Tom Driberg, a homosexual and communistwho later became a prominent Labour Party Member of Parliament. Driberg wasknown to haunt public lavatories and in later years he became friends with thenotorious Kray Brothers, Swinging London’s criminal elite; according to thepsychologist Anthony Storr, he was the only person he ever met whom he couldtruly call evil.24 [index_split_019.html#filepos827965] While at Oxford in 1926,Driberg wrote to Crowley after reading The Diary of a Drug Fiend, and during avisit to London, Crowley met him for lunch at the Tour Eiffel restaurant inFitzrovia, Crowley’s stomping ground in later years. Driberg never became adisciple, but he did support Crowley and at some point acquired one of hisdiaries, which he later sold to Jimmy Page for a princely sum. Ironically,Driberg became a journalist for the Daily Express—a Beaverbrook paper—and inlater years it emerged that he had for many years been a Russian spy. Whether hehad XI0 relations with Crowley is unclear.A less disreputable acolyte was Israel Regardie. Regardie first wrote to Crowleyafter reading Book Four. He was born in London in 1907 to an East End Jewishfamily; they moved to the States in 1920. Regardie’s search for occult wisdombegan at fifteen, when he read Blavatsky’s Secret Doctrine. At eighteen, afterhearing a lecture about Crowley’s ideas, he wrote to him again, and the Beastadvised contacting Karl Germer, who was then living in New York City. Germersold Regardie a set of the Equinox and the two became friends. In 1928 Crowleyaccepted Regardie’s offer to come to Paris and be his unpaid personal secretary.Regardie told his parents that he would study art in France, but he told hissister that he would really study magick. She took one look at the Equinox, wasshocked by what she read, and tried to prevent his getting a French visa. It wastoo late, although the French authorities assured her they would look into thematter.Regardie arrived at Gare St. Lazare in Paris on October 12, 1928. It wasCrowley’s fifty-third birthday and he met his new amanuensis wearing blue-graytweeds, plus fours, and a cap. From this point on, Crowley increasingly appearssomething of an anachronism, holding on to a British style that went out offashion after World War I; from his photographs, one expects him to say “pippip” and “cheerio.”25 [index_split_019.html#filepos828208] Tall and heavyset, ina thin, slurring voice Crowley proclaimed the Law to Regardie, his eyes gleaming“pleasantly over the dark bags beneath them,” his hand offering a limpgreeting.26 [index_split_019.html#filepos828758] Regardie remarked thatCrowley’s eyes were “inclined to fix themselves in one position and bore in,”the basilisk stare many have commented on.27[index_split_019.html#filepos828920] As soon as he arrived, Regardie handed overhis savings, some $1,200; not only did he work for Crowley without salary, healso paid for his magical instruction. As he did with Germer’s largesse, Crowleysoon spent Regardie’s tribute on his lavish lifestyle, although he maintainedthat this was in order to free Regardie of any attachment to money, something hecertainly did.Like Neuburg, Mudd, and Maitland, Regardie was a nervous, inhibited,self-conscious character—what in the 1960s was called “uptight”—and speakingwith Crowley he felt “completely exposed.” He felt even more exposed thatevening when, after dinner and cognac, Crowley and his latest Scarlet Woman, thePolish Kasimira Bass—her reign was brief—performed an opus before his eyes.Regardie, flustered, left the room. Crowley took note and his first assignmentfor his new recruit was to visit as many brothels as possible. This seems hardlyinstructive, but Crowley’s “teaching” aimed to make applicants more likehimself. He also told Regardie, whom he called the Serpent, to order a suit fromhis tailor and to send him the bill; it was, of course, never paid. Around thesame time, Crowley attracted another well-heeled young man interested in magick.Gerald Yorke had been to Eton and Cambridge; he was the nephew of an earl andthe cousin of a baron, and his father owned an impressive estate. Like Regardie,he had come upon the Equinox and was transfixed. Writing to Crowley, hesuggested meeting in Paris. Crowley must have wondered if there were two “richmen from the west,” as Yorke arranged that they should meet at the Parisairport; air travel then was the prerogative of the very wealthy. They carriedon to Cassis, where Yorke received his first magical training and his inductioninto the A...A... Yorke became Crowley’s business advisor and financial manager.Although their relationship had its rocky patches—several, in fact—Yorkeremained loyal, and years later he donated his collection of Crowleyana toLondon’s Warburg Institute. Comprised of books, manuscripts, magicalparaphernalia, and even clothes, it remains the largest single collection ofCrowley material available for study.Yorke and Regardie often met at Crowley’s flat, where Regardie lived. Here theywere subjected to the Beast’s unnerving regimen of late hours, chess, cigar andpipe smoke, copious alcohol, and drugs. They were also concerned that, inRegardie’s words, he would try some “homosexual monkey tricks” on them, butCrowley didn’t. Regardie remained at Crowley’s side for four years, buteventually broke with him in 1932 over “the nasty, petty, vicious louse thatoccasionally he was.” One would only question that “occasionally,” but like manywho encountered Crowley’s venom, Regardie often minimized Crowley’s nastinessand emphasized his own unworthiness. Even without the sex, there was somethingof a dominance/submission relationship between them. When, after separating,Regardie sent Crowley a copy of one of his books, and Crowley repliednegatively, Regardie wrote a petulant letter, calling Crowley “Alice” and sayinghe was a “contemptible bitch.”28 [index_split_019.html#filepos829045] Crowleyretaliated, circulating an anonymous letter in which, as he did with Neuburg, heberates Regardie for his Jewishness, and compiles a litany of his failings,including constipation, masturbation, and gonorrhea. (Oddly, Regardie publishesthis piece of turpitude in full.) Their unedifying exchange is like that betweentwo “queens” caught in a catfight. Yet Regardie’s book, The Eye in the Triangle,written in response to John Symonds’s The Great Beast, often gives theimpression that it doth protest Crowley’s innocence too much, and is therebysuspect; at the end of it, Regardie himself admits that it is with real reliefthat he can unburden himself of the task of exonerating Crowley. After Crowley,Regardie went on to join the Stella Matutina, a Golden Dawn offshoot, and towrite a series of intelligent books bringing together insights from alchemy,Jungian analysis, and Reichian therapy. His Tree of Life, one of the first bookson magick I read, which synthesizes Crowley’s system with that of the GoldenDawn, remains a classic. He did, however, pull a Crowley himself when hegathered the Golden Dawn material that he vowed to keep secret and, breaking hisoaths, published it in The Golden Dawn (1937–1940).Not long after Regardie arrived, Kasimira Bass departed. Regardie was asked tobreak the news. On hearing it, Crowley reflected that the Lord giveth and theLord taketh away. He was most likely happy she departed as Kasimira seems tohave had a mind of her own. Her place was soon filled. The fortyish Maria TeresaFerrari de Miramar, a native of Nicaragua, had considerable magical potentialand Crowley called her the High Priestess of Voodoo. They met at the end of 1928and were soon enmeshed in the sexual, emotional, and magical turbulence thatinvariably accompanied Crowley’s affairs.Much of this time Crowley was occupied with the publication of his magnum opus,Magick in Theory and Practice, a continuation of his earlier Book Four.Synthesizing Western and Eastern occult systems, and binding the lot with thelaw of thelema, the work is full of Crowley’s obsessions and erudite but obscurehumor. As mentioned earlier, it is not, in any way, written for “all,” despiteCrowley’s protestations. For connoisseurs it remains rich fare, but for theaverage reader it is impenetrable, or, at best, an acquired taste. Crowleyrecaps material presented in Book Four and introduces the Beast, Scarlet Woman,and Whore of Babalon; I mention the rituals, exercises, and reading lists in theintroduction. In essence Crowley tries to modernize magick, to free it of itstraditional encumbrances, to anchor it in the psyche and imagination of themagician. But he is too fond of hinting at hidden knowledge, giving the worktwists and turns that either fascinate or befuddle, but are clearly meant toentice the reader to seek him out. And he can’t avoid a generous sprinkling ofhis sardonic wit. In chapter XII, “Of the Bloody Sacrifice,” after assessing thevirtues of different sacrificial animals, Crowley drops a subtle bombshell. “Amale of perfect innocence and high intelligence is the most satisfactory andsuitable victim,” he writes, adding, in a poker-faced footnote, that FraterPerdurabo made this sacrifice 150 times a year between 1912 and 1928.29[index_split_019.html#filepos829402] Crowley isn’t speaking of child sacrifice,but of his own sperm. Magick has no direct sexual references, but for those whoknow, they are there. Crowley surely chuckled at the readers who took his remarkseriously. But why shouldn’t they, given he went out of his way to presenthimself as some demonic wizard? In any case, the readers Crowley wanted to shockwith this adolescent gag never even looked at the book.One interesting passage escapes mention by most of Crowley’s commentators.Speaking of the Astral Plane, Crowley writes that the magician “may go for along time being fooled and flattered by the Astrals that he has himself modifiedor manufactured.” “They will,” he writes, “pretend to show him marvelousmysteries.” He “will incline to accept them as true, for the very reason thatthey are the images of himself idealized by imagination.” “He will becomeincreasingly interested in himself, imagine himself to be attaining oneinitiation after another. His Ego will expand unchecked, till he seems tohimself to have heaven at his feet. Yet all this will be nothing but the fool’sface of Narcissus smirking up from the pool that will drown him.”30[index_split_019.html#filepos829570] Readers may detect a similarity here withCrowley’s dark musings following his expulsion from Cefalù. Did Crowley know hewas talking about himself?Crowley didn’t trust magick to make Magick a success. He hired a publicity agentto revamp his public profile. C. Vidal Hunt took on the daunting task ofrelaunching Crowley’s career. Hunt, however, soon discovered that Crowley couldbe his own worst enemy. He could not, Hunt complained, “act pretty over a cup oftea”—that is, make a good impression—nor could he be taught new tricks. Crowleyhad, it seems, “crystallized,” to use Gurdjieff’s term. Even with his own bestinterests at stake, he couldn’t act “out of character.” Hunt had other problemswith Crowley. Hunt tried to embroil Crowley in a scheme involving a richAmerican widow and a pauper Spanish aristocrat. Crowley was to cook up a phonyhoroscope informing the millionairess that Don Luis Fernando de Bourbon was Mr.Right. Crowley thought astrology was only minimally true, but to his credit hedeclined, and even warned the rich American about the scheme.31[index_split_019.html#filepos829697] Hunt was not happy and he took hisdispleasure to the Sûreté Géneralé. Hunt was not the only person to mentionCrowley to the French authorities. Regardie’s sister’s concerns had also reachedthem. Whether it was Hunt, Regardie’s sister, or some other influence, onJanuary 17, 1929, Crowley was visited by an inspector from the Préfecture dePolice. The encounter has the air of a Marx Brothers film. After questions abouthis past, drugs, magick, and Kabbalah—the inspector expressed a surprising wishto study it—the conversation shifted to a mysterious device Crowley had restingon a table. Crowley believed that the befuddled flic thought it was a bomb, oran apparatus for distilling cocaine, but it was only a harmless espressomachine—although that a Parisian would not know this strikes me as unlikely.Crowley believed he had made a good impression, but the flic’s superiors didnot, as a month later the Minister of the Interior issued a refus de séjour—anexpulsion order—for Crowley, the High Priestess, and the Serpent.32[index_split_019.html#filepos829852] They had twenty-four hours to leave France.Crowley managed to extend his stay, claiming illness; he would not leave untilhe had a copy of Magick in his hands. As no English publisher would touch it,Gerald Yorke and Karl Germer paid for a French publisher, the Lecram Press, toproduce it. Regardie and Señora de Miramar had managed British visas, butCrowley’s doctor’s certificate allowed him to stay. The Serpent and the HighPriestess, however, soon hit a bump. The British authorities refused entry andas soon as they arrived they were summarily shipped back to France. Eventuallythey obtained Belgian visas and reached Brussels nearly a week after leavingParis.On April 12 Crowley received a copy of his masterpiece. He was ecstatic. Yetwhen it was released to the public, the book Crowley had written for allreceived few, if any, reviews, and was ignored by the Banker, Biologist, Grocer,and Factory Girl whose lives he had hoped to fulfill through it. It must havebeen disappointing; another advertisement for his new aeon had drawn a blank.Less than a week later he was heading to Brussels, where he stayed for a shorttime, reunited with his Scarlet Woman. But soon enough he was heading across theChannel. A Colonel Carter of Scotland Yard had contacted Gerald Yorke—the twoknew each other through Masonic connections—and had warned him about associatingwith Crowley. Yorke convinced Carter that the Beast was not as black as he waspainted, and according to one account, it was Carter himself who paid forCrowley’s voyage back to Britain. Carter, it seems, had plans for Crowley, andthe two soon met with Yorke at dinner. Crowley wanted to confirm his legalstanding, and Carter was interested in helping Crowley, in return for favors tobe called in later. Crowley, at any rate, had no trouble returning to England.The tabloids growled about his evil doings, but the authorities apparentlyturned a blind eye.Yet if Magick had received no notice, Crowley’s expulsion certainly did. It hitthe international papers; in France even a “true crime” magazine, Detective,sported Crowley in his Ku Klux Klannish hood on its cover and reported hisfiendish deeds.33 [index_split_019.html#filepos830789] In an interview Crowley,ever the martyr, compared his plight to the famous Dreyfus case of thenineteenth century; the irony of an anti-Semite comparing the tragedy of a Jewwrongly accused and sent to Devil’s Island to his own situation escaped him.34[index_split_019.html#filepos831027] The most likely reason the French expelledCrowley was his pro-German work in America, and the fact that he was the head ofa German occult organization. He was understandably suspected of being a Germanspy.As had happened with Leah and Norman Mudd, in Brussels the Serpent and the HighPriestess were thrown into each other’s arms. Or more likely the matronly HighPriestess took charge of the young Serpent and performed an unscheduled opus.Regardie was concerned about the impropriety—what would the master think?—butsoon enough there were new troubles. Now the Belgians wanted them out, too.Regardie, who was after all British born, should have been allowed entry toEngland. He was discovering what learning from Crowley was all about. EventuallyRegardie somehow managed to enter Britain; most likely Colonel Carter helped.Karl Germer rescued Señora de Miramar, transporting her to Leipzig, where shestayed with the helpful Martha Küntzel. Soon after, Crowley arrived and onAugust 16, he and the High Priestess married. The main reason was to facilitateMaria’s entry into England; it was a union of practicality, not passion. Yetlike all his others, it would not last.One reason Crowley wanted to be in London was to find a publisher. He hadcompleted the Confessions and it needed a home. It found one in June whenCrowley met P. R. Stephenson, who ran the small Mandrake Press with his partner,Edward Goldston. Their offices were on Museum Street, near the British Museum.Stephenson admired rebels; he had recently published a collection of D. H.Lawrence’s erotic paintings and he saw in Crowley another warrior againstrepression. Stephenson offered Crowley a £50 advance for the Confessions andMoonchild and a collection of stories, The Stratagem and Other Stories.Stephenson himself wrote a book attacking Crowley’s treatment in the press, butThe Legend of Aleister Crowley, intended to attract potential readers, was afailure, as were Crowley’s books. Bookshops refused to carry the Confessions;the enormous A of Crowley’s signature on the cover, clearly an erect penis andtesticles, could not have helped, likewise his equally phallic idealizedself-portrait. Crowley had only himself to blame, but the work itself is in noway blasphemous. It is a very readable, often insightful, and occasionallybrilliant account by an unabashed egoist of his undeniably unusual life. Onetires of his tireless self-regard and self-justification, but then this is trueof Casanova, Rousseau, and other celebrated self-proclaimers. Only the first twovolumes appeared in 1930; the remaining four languished until an abridgedone-volume edition appeared in 1969, edited by John Symonds and Kenneth Grant.That posthumous edition was something of a bestseller, but 1969 was not 1930.Eventually Crowley fell out with Stephenson and Goldston, and a reborn MandrakePress with Gerald Yorke, Karl Germer, and Robin Thyme—who we will return to—atthe helm did not do much better.In February 1930, Arthur Calder-Marshall, of the Oxford Poetry Society, invitedCrowley to give a talk. Rather than speak of his earliest passion, Crowleydecided to lecture on the fifteenth-century child murderer Gilles de Rais.Predictably, when the authorities found out, they banned the lecture. Crowleyprinted it as a pamphlet and had sandwich-board men hawk it on the streets. Thecontroversy helped sales, but that was the lecture’s only attraction; it is atedious march over well-trodden anti-Christian ground. Other speed bumpsappeared. Later that year Crowley tried to exhibit his paintings, but no gallerywould accept them. Even the Mandrake Press refused to hang them; the flack theygot showing D. H. Lawrence’s canvases informed their decision. When his estateagent, courtesy of an article in John Bull, discovered that Crowley was tryingto exhibit his work near an apartment he wished to rent, he refused to rent himthe flat. Crowley got the message. He gathered a large collection of works anddecided to return to Germany, where he was appreciated.By this time his marriage to the High Priestess was kaput. She was drinkingheavily, was hysterical, and in general falling apart. On an earlier visit toGermany, she and the Beast quarreled viciously. Crowley consoled himself bydiscovering nineteen-year-old Hanni Jaegger in the studio of an artistacquaintance. While Crowley predictably fell in love with Hanni, Maria sankdeeper into drink. She became unmanageable and he was forced to leave her withMartha Küntzel in Leipzig while he returned to England. When Maria returned too,they took a flat in Knightsbridge, but her days as the Scarlet Woman were over.She had become an embarrassment and made drunken advances to any male who turnedup; that Crowley paid her less and less attention may have contributed to this.On August 1, 1930, Crowley headed for Berlin. At his farewell party, Maria drankherself unconscious and he left her on the floor. He cut off all financial tiesand instructed his lawyers to start divorce proceedings immediately. “Dismissedwife, without notice,” he noted in his diary. The marriage had lasted less thana year. As he had with Leah, Crowley dumped Maria on others, Gerald Yorke inthis instance. Maria was penniless and on her way to a lunatic asylum, and Yorkehad to deal with it.Young Hanni rejuvenated the fifty-four-year-old Perdurabo, who was doing verylittle magick but much thelema. After a romp in Berlin Crowley and his ScarletTeenager headed to London, the first leg on another magical retirement. AvoidingMaria, who was languishing in Hampstead—Gerald Yorke had found her aplace—Crowley and his nymph raced to Southampton, en route to Lisbon. Crowleyhad been corresponding with the Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa. The two hadmuch in common: both played chess, were interested in the occult, and shared anaddiction to alter egos. In Pessoa’s case, this manifested in the manyheteronyms he devised—not mere pseudonyms, but actual other literarypersonalities, other characters, whom he invented to author his poems.35[index_split_019.html#filepos831178] Pessoa was an Anglophile; he had translatedCrowley’s “Hymn to Pan” and included it in Presenca (1931), one of the few ofhis works published in his lifetime. At first Hanni proved excellent at opera,especially p.v.n., and Crowley christened her “The Monster.” She had unusualdesires and apparently liked Crowley to use her as a WC—a toilet.36[index_split_019.html#filepos831373] He had other lovers, too, with whom heenjoyed “psychological cruelty,” but apparently Hanni only complained aboutbeing forced to watch Karl Germer masturbate.37[index_split_019.html#filepos831529] Unsurprisingly, she was less than stableand soon into their whirlwind adventure, she, too, started to unravel. After aferocious argument, Crowley and his waif had to leave their hotel. While Crowleychecked into a new one, Hanni bolted. She vanished and Crowley confided hisconcerns to Pessoa. A few days later he found her; she was booked on the nextboat heading to Germany. All his entreaties failed; the American consul hadadvised her to head home as soon as possible. Crowley was desperate. What couldhe do?He decided, with the help of Pessoa, to fake a suicide. At the Boca do Inferno(“The Mouth of Hell”), an arched rock formation near the sea, he took a leaffrom Sherlock Holmes and left a note weighed down by his cigarette case.38[index_split_019.html#filepos831650] “I cannot live without you,” it read.Crowley then headed for Germany. Pessoa spread the story and the press ran withit. Mysterious disappearance of infamous black magician. Had the Beast finallybought it? Was there foul play? In Berlin, Crowley found Hanni and they patchedthings up, temporarily; he even got her to write a letter accusing the Americanconsul in Lisbon of sexual harassment. Then, on October 11, the day before hisfifty-fifth birthday, the mystery was solved, and the world breathed a sigh ofrelief. The Beast was back, and his paintings adorned the GalleryNeumann-Nierendorf in Berlin. Among them were portraits of Mudd, Leah, andAldous Huxley, whom Crowley had met recently. Again, Crowley garnered somepress—the main idea—but no paintings sold and things were not exactly wunderbarwith Hanni. She was deeply depressed, sobbed constantly, and spoke often ofsuicide; she would, in fact, kill herself, not long after her predecessor wascommitted to a mental home.Maria was not doing well. Even when Colonel Carter advised Crowley to return toLondon to take care of his wife, the Beast did not respond. Crowley informedMaria that she should file for divorce, and he obligingly admitted toforty-seven acts of adultery with Hanni since August 3 as evidence—not much, heagreed, but he had been traveling. It was around this time that both Yorke andRegardie threw up their hands at the master. Not long before, Maria had had toenter a public workhouse; she had no money and her association with Crowleyprevented her from finding work. On June 16, 1931, Maria was admitted to theColney Hatch lunatic asylum, suffering from paranoia, manic depression, anddelusions. She believed she was George V’s daughter and was married to herbrother, the Prince of Wales, but she also harbored weird ideas about being theScarlet Woman of the Beast 666—her doctors were unaware of Crowley’s ministry.By this time Hanni, too, had left.Crowley was unfazed. He had already met Hanni’s replacement. On Berlin’s Unterden Linden, thirty-six-year-old Bertha Busch—he would call her Billie—approachedCrowley. She was just the thing he needed: into S&M, p.v.n., drugs, drink, andthe rest. Crowley threw himself into the Weimar twilight, a grinning golem letloose in Cabaret. He and Billie liked to fight. On one occasion, some NaziYouths roughed him up when they caught him slapping her against a wall. Onanother she stabbed him with a butcher knife. For a time Crowley shared a flatwith Gerald Hamilton, the model for Christopher Isherwood’s Mr. Norris in hisBerlin Stories. One time Hamilton returned home and found Billie drugged andtrussed up with a note saying not to release her. On another occasion, findingBillie stark naked on the freezing floor, Hamilton woke Crowley and asked if shewas ill. “Hasn’t that bitch gone to bed yet?” a half-dressed Crowley askedbefore landing Billie a vicious kick. The flat was usually strewn with brokendishes, Billie’s favorite mode of defense, and on more than one occasion adoctor had to give Billie a sedative, usually a morphine injection. Karl Germerdid not like her—she was not, he felt, true Scarlet Woman material—but Crowleyparaded Billie around, introducing her to people such as Isherwood and the poetStephen Spender, who visited Crowley at his flat. Isherwood relates how he oncesaw Crowley trail his fingernail—long repellent things—down the bare chest of astud in a Berlin boy bar, and how he just escaped being beaten up. “The trulyawful thing about Crowley,” Isherwood wrote, “is that one suspects he didn’treally believe in anything.”39 [index_split_019.html#filepos831895] The onlything real about Crowley, Isherwood thought, was his drug addiction.Gerald Hamilton had a history as dubious as his flat-mate’s. Like Crowley, hehad been branded a traitor because of his friendship with Roger Casement, theIrish Republic supporter. Hamilton was a communist, and he introduced Crowley tosome of the leading Reds in town, whom Crowley did his best to convert tothelema. But Crowley got more than introductions from Hamilton. Colonel Carterhad arranged for Crowley to report on Hamilton’s activities; for the sum of £50,Crowley became something of a real-life spy, although of a rather seedy sort.Crowley clued Carter in to anything of note happening with Nazis, nationalists,communists, secret societies, or anything else that would justify his keep. Hewas, in short, a paid informer. In a case of Spy vs. Spy, Hamilton was doing thesame for the Nazis about Crowley; they were keen on any information about occultsocieties, Freemasons, and Illuminati, and were already taking steps toneutralize these potential threats.Crowley liked Berlin; it was the kind of place he felt at home in. Everything hereally enjoyed was on tap. But eventually he had to return to England; beingkicked out of his flat precipitated that. Billie had gone ahead, on afund-raising tour, but came up empty-handed. Crowley still hunted for apublisher, and was miffed to discover that his student Regardie was having muchmore luck in that regard. Thoughts of death came to him, and he drew up a will,asking to be buried, once again, like Christian Rosenkreutz, or on a cliffbehind Boleskine, or, failing that, in Westminster Abbey. But there was no restfor the wicked. On June 21, the summer solstice, he returned to Britain. Aftertaking a flat on Albemarle Street near Piccadilly Circus, in July he went toColney Hatch to visit Maria. He wanted her to sign papers releasing him from anyfinancial responsibility, but her doctors advised him against seeing her. Itwould only upset an already badly unstable woman; Maria remained in care for therest of her life. At the asylum Billie threw a fit and soon after disappearedfrom Crowley’s world. He had tired of her anyway; her letters, asking for areunion, went unanswered. That chapter in his life had closed. Now began thelast days of the Beast."},{"pageContent":"TENTHE SUNSET OF CROWLEYANITY> [images/00004.jpg] At first, Crowley’s return to Britain seemed promising. A lecture for Foyle’sLiterary Luncheon in September 1932 on “The Philosophy of Magick” was wellreceived, as was another for the National Laboratory of Psychical Research on“The Elixir of Life: Our Magical Medicine” in October. Crowley’s topic for thistalk was the benefits of a tonic he had devised using his own semen. Amrita, theElixir of Life—the name of Crowley’s rejuvenating pills—was, he claimed, 100percent effective, and for a time his homemade Viagra turned a few bob. Butmoney remained a problem and in the early part of the new year, Crowley found away to bring some in. In January 1933 Crowley noticed an advertisement for hisnovel Moonchild in the window of a bookseller on Praed Street. It mentioned thatThe Diary of a Drug Fiend had been withdrawn from circulation after it had beenattacked in the press. This was technically incorrect; the book was notwithdrawn, simply allowed to go out of print. The bookseller aimed to boostsales with a little sensationalism, no doubt, which could only be to Crowley’sadvantage; the novel had languished since its publication. But Crowley stillsmarted from the libels he suffered and would not let this one go unchallenged.Crowley sued the bookseller and for once the law agreed with him. When the casewas heard in May, the judge remarked that there wasn’t the slightest grounds forbelieving that anything Crowley wrote was indecent or improper. Evidently thejudge did not read the Beaverbrook papers. Crowley won £50 in damages withcosts. Unbelievably, neither the bookseller nor his defense pointed out that theadvertisement only quoted from the blurb Crowley himself had written for thebook’s dust jacket.Crowley already had another, weightier litigation on the boil. The year before,Nina Hamnett, his old friend and onetime member of the A...A...—they had knowneach other for twenty years—had published her memoirs, Laughing Torso; the titlecomes from her life as an artist’s model. Before publication she had written toCrowley telling him that he was mentioned in the book. Everything was “very niceand agreeable,” Nina assured him. “No libel, no rubbish.”1[index_split_019.html#filepos832250]Crowley would be the judge of that. He opened the book and discovered that hewas said to have practiced black magic in Cefalù. It was also said that a babyhad disappeared there, and that something had happened with a goat. Crowleydecided that Nina was wrong. There were certainly grounds for a lawsuit in theseheinous, if tongue-in-cheek, remarks. But, being a friend, he offered her thechance to settle out of court. Failing that, he even explained how they couldboth benefit financially by his winning the suit. But Nina disagreed and thistime Crowley was taking on more than a single bookseller. Nina’s publisher,Constable and Co., who would be party to the defense, knew their stuff andsuggested Crowley do his worst. He did.Crowley’s solicitors knew he had a shaky case—the remarks were barely libelous,if at all—and asked him to get witnesses to testify to his integrity. J.W.N.Sullivan, J.F.C. Fuller (now a major general), and J. D. Beresford—who hadcommissioned The Diary of a Drug Fiend—all declined. Beresford even advisedCrowley to drop the case. Any trial would amount to an examination of the lifeand ideas of the Beast and Crowley would not survive it. Crowley ignoredBeresford’s advice. But Crowley’s counsel was worried and, considering whatmight come to light, asked for a copy of White Stains. After looking at it theyadvised Crowley that if it got into the defense’s hands his case was gone.The case opened in April 1934 and the defense went straight to the point. Theyasked Crowley if he was bringing suit because his reputation had been damaged,and then made it unmistakably clear that Crowley had no reputation to besmirch.Was he not called the “wickedest man in the world”? And did he not for most ofhis life openly defy all moral conventions and display contempt forChristianity? (Crowley, of course, had, but he judiciously denied it; it was anabject repudiation of his whole career.) And was he not called the Beast 666 andthe Master Therion? Crowley tried to jollify the proceedings when, in answeringwhat “the Beast 666” actually meant, he replied “sunlight” and suggested that hebe called “Little Sunshine.” The audience laughed but not the judge or jury.When the defense produced a copy of White Stains, Crowley’s lawyers’ fears wererealized. After the judge perused it the jury declined; they had no need. Andwhen Betty May testified to the squalid scenes she had witnessed at theabbey—including Crowley’s home decorating for his La Chambre des Cauchemars—theend was near. After four days Crowley lost the case, and he had to pay costs.The judge remarked to the jury that in his forty years of service, he had neverheard such “dreadful, horrible, blasphemous, and abominable stuff as that whichhas been produced by the man who describes himself to you as the greatest livingpoet.” But this was not all. The case bankrupted Crowley; he could not have wonsubstantial damages anyway, but now he was truly destitute. His debts amountedto nearly £5,000. His nonexistent assets amounted to £15,000 that he claimed hewould have earned had Gerald Yorke not been his business advisor; Crowley hadrecently served writ on Yorke for that sum and of course it would nevermaterialize.2 [index_split_019.html#filepos832404] And shortly after he was alsofined for illegally obtaining letters of Betty May’s that he had used in court.They did not help and only made things worse for him. The judge spared him aprison sentence, but he was put on probation and told if he was brought beforethe court again, he would receive six months.Crowley’s own comment on the proceedings was magnificently unrealistic. He notedthat its verdict brought “General joy—the consternation of Constable and Co.”This was about as far removed from reality as one could get; it practicallyverges on the delusional. All his hopes, dreams, plans, and fantasies aboutbeing recognized as a great poet, thinker, or prophet had been soundly dashed.Crowley’s reputation was now truly unrecoverable. In court there were nodramatic speeches energizing the few who were ready to “assume Kingship and rulethe disorganized and bewildered mob,” only feeble attempts at wit à la OscarWilde, and absolutely no clue about how badly these were received. Crowley’s oneconsolation was the publicity; he clung to the fact that his name was once againin the papers. Being in the spotlight, even as the wickedest man in the world,always gratified him.Crowley had by now acquired a new Scarlet Woman, his last. Pearl Brooksmith wasthirty-five, a widow and, according to the I Ching, which Crowley consulted onher account, looking for the Great Man. She met Crowley instead and performedher first opus, per manu, sometime in August 1933. Pearl was fond of saying “Ifeel the flame of fornication creeping up my body” and she did her best to meanit. She, like Rose and Maria, would end up in a mental home. But Crowley’sattentions were soon diverted to nineteen-year-old Patricia Doherty, who hadattended the libel trial and thought it was a travesty. The legend is that shehad approached Crowley afterward, and declaring that the verdict was the worstthing since the Crucifixion, offered to be the mother of his child. The realitywas less dramatic, although she did have a son by Crowley, his only officialone, whom he named Ataturk; he was also called Randall Gair, and he arrived onMay 2, 1937.3 [index_split_019.html#filepos832978] Patricia was the mistress ofRobin Thynne, who had been on the board of the Mandrake Press. Thynne, in hisfifties, was himself an interesting character: a follower of Rudolf Steiner butalso a “de-mobbed officer on the make . . . ever on the lookout for thrills andremuneration.”4 [index_split_019.html#filepos833946] John Bull had targeted himas well, exposing some shady business operations he was involved in; for onceCrowley agreed with them, calling Thynne a “swindler and a share-pusher of theworst type.”5 [index_split_019.html#filepos834113] Pat had lived in Cornwallwith her grandparents; this is where she met Thynne. They sent her to London tolive with a relative, the High Court Judge Lord Justice Slesser, ostensibly tohave more opportunities, but also to end the relationship with Thynne. LordSlesser invited Pat to watch the Laughing Torso trial. She did and was takenwith Crowley. She did not, however, become his lover until 1936, after Thynne’ssudden death. Why Crowley would have been attracted to her is no mystery, butwhy she decided to have a child by him is—although she would have severalsubsequent children, legitimate or not; she, in a way, collected them, and laterran a kind of orphanage.6 [index_split_019.html#filepos834233]Life with Pearl saw Crowley at a low ebb. The libel trial had shattered him, andmany old friends avoided him. Louis Wilkinson told his son Oliver, by now agrown man, not to give Crowley his address; at this point Crowley was living ina slum in Paddington Green, a disreputable part of town.7[index_split_019.html#filepos834434] The artist and magician Ithell Colquhounrecalled seeing Crowley in a bookshop, and remarked that his skin was “the colorand texture of parchment.”8 [index_split_019.html#filepos834686] A visitor to anold, dilapidated house on Great Ormond Street recalled being met by a “corpulentman dressed in plus-fours” who smelled of alcohol. In a shabby-genteel roomPearl, a “chlorotic-looking lady” whom Crowley introduced as “the BlessedVirgin,” reclined on a couch. As Crowley excused himself to use a machine forhis asthma, Pearl explained that they had recently been thrown out of a flatnear Regent’s Park Zoo. Pearl explained that Crowley needed someone to “mother”him. “The poor thing” was, after all, “only a child,” an astute observation.They had, yes, some trouble with the landlord. He had apparently discovered themnaked, in the basement, performing a rite of Pan, and had read them the riotact.9 [index_split_019.html#filepos834844]Alan Burnett-Rae was Crowley’s landlord for a brief period around this time. Hehad first encountered Crowley in 1934 at the Mayfair Hotel, where the occultistand hypnotist Alexander Cannon tried to levitate the dancer Vaslav Nijinsky’sdaughter.10 [index_split_019.html#filepos834974] In 1936 Burnett-Rae came intosome property on Welbeck Street, in the West End, and the West Indian mysticRollo Ahmed, author of The Black Arts (1936), asked if he had a room for “a veryhighly evolved personality” who would be a very satisfactory tenant. This turnedout to be Crowley.11 [index_split_019.html#filepos835233] In later years, Ahmedchanged his mind about the Beast, calling him after his death a “self-proclaimedHigh Priest of Black Magic and Satanism,” and castigating his “foulpractices.”12 [index_split_019.html#filepos835354] Yet Ahmed himself was noangel; by the time he met Burnett-Rae he had served two sentences for fraud andwould serve time again in 1946.13 [index_split_019.html#filepos835544]Burnett-Rae gave Crowley a room and soon the “satisfactory tenant” wasdisturbing his housemates with incense and arguments, and generally being atenant from hell. Burnett-Rae, though, did enjoy the stories; among others,Crowley told him that his walking stick was made of a rhinoceros’s penis.Crowley certainly looked bad. His teeth reminded Burnett-Rae of the black keyson a piano, and in 1937 his infamous Serpent’s Tooth broke off in a Turkishbath. He was overweight, badly dressed, asthmatic, and clumsy. He also tried toget Burnett-Rae to invest in one scheme or another. At one point, while livingon Hasker Street—Burnett-Rae had by then thrown him out but Crowley had kept intouch—Crowley asked him to fund a health clinic he was setting up; along withhis Amrita pills, he would provide osteopathy, vibrators, infrared lights, andsomething he called “Zotofoam.”14 [index_split_019.html#filepos835721] Otherget-rich-quick schemes were a Black Magic restaurant, a board game calledThelema, and selling “We Want Our King” buttons to people who were opposed toKing Edward VIII’s abdication to marry Wallis Simpson. All came to nothing.Pearl herself wanted to give Crowley a child, as well as the kind of visions headmired in a woman, but her attempts at astral traveling proved unconvincing andat getting pregnant even worse and soon Pearl’s health suffered badly. InJanuary 1936 she had a hysterectomy, ending the possibility of her providingCrowley with offspring. She began to suffer hallucinations and was removed, asmentioned, to a mental home. From here she wrote to Crowley, begging to be takenaway, because the Devil, who was under her bed, wanted to kidnap her. Thissounds like leaping out of the frying pan into the fire and then back again.Naturally, Crowley ignored her. Impregnating Pat, however, was no picnic.Crowley’s impotence had worsened and the necessary opus required some effort.Later, the mission accomplished, Crowley introduced Burnett-Rae to Pat and hisson, Ataturk, at the Café Royal. When Burnett-Rae was unable to locate thelittle Crowley, the Beast pointed out he was still recumbent in Pat’s womb.—MOST OF CROWLEY’S life now was spent treading water. He was in his sixties, atime when most men contemplate retirement after a fulfilled career. Thatcontentment escaped Crowley; every day was a struggle simply to make the rent.Most of the time he was ill; decades of abuse had taken their toll. And he hadlost many friends, either through his own insensitivity or the black cloud ofdisrepute that followed him. And aside from his last important work on thetarot, which we will look at shortly, there was little ahead. He did compose asmall volume, Little Essays in Truth, which is a neat summing up of some of hiscentral themes, but it is little more than a gentle walk down thelemic lanes. In“Trance” Crowley reaffirms his basic muddle: “The whole and sole object of alltrue Magical and Mystical training is to become free from every kind oflimitation.”15 [index_split_019.html#filepos835880] He had sought this all hislife, and where had it landed him? But there were still flare-ups of the oldprovocateur.—IN 1937 The Equinox of the Gods appeared; Gerald Yorke and Israel Regardiefunded its publication. This consisted of The Book of the Law, an account ofCrowley’s magical career, and a reproduction of the Stele of Revealing. (Symondsnotes that a typo had this as the “Stele of Reveling,” which makes a kind ofsense.) On the evening of Christmas Day Crowley and Gerald Yorke—he was nolonger in the A... A..., having rejected The Book of the Law, but had remainedCrowley’s friend—went on a pub crawl. After shanghaiing a Jew, an Indian, anAfrican, and a Malaysian, they headed to Cleopatra’s Needle on the ThamesEmbankment. At 6:22 a.m., as the sun entered Capricorn, in the shadow of theancient obelisk, Crowley proclaimed the Law and, announcing it as a charter ofuniversal freedom, handed copies of the book to the representatives of theraces.16 [index_split_019.html#filepos836064] It was also around this time thathe gave his Eight Lectures on Yoga. When inspired he could still draw on hisclarity and wit; the lectures were not well attended, but, as mentioned, theyshow Crowley at his best. He received correspondence from his readers, askingadvice on matters magical and personal. Some may have gratified him butothers—such as that from a gentleman suffering from excessive sweat andnocturnal emissions—must have tried his patience.Things weren’t doing too well on the thelemic front, either. Hitler had bannedthe O.T.O., A...A..., and nearly every other occult fraternity. Karl Germer wasput into a concentration camp. His U.S. visa had expired and in 1935 he had toreturn to Germany; he was arrested practically on his return, specificallybecause of his association with Crowley. He was released ten months later andwent to Belgium where, in 1940, because of his German nationality, he wasarrested again and sent to a French concentration camp, where he spent anotherten months. Germer endured these ordeals by concentrating on his Holy GuardianAngel and meditating on Crowley’s Holy Books. In 1941 he immigrated to America,where he remained until his death in 1962. Reports are that even in the States,he was harassed by the FBI, who suspected him of being a Nazi spy; Crowley’sFatherland propaganda didn’t help, as the authorities believed he was Germer’s“controller.” Whenever he could, he sent money to Crowley.Martha Küntzel’s home was raided and all her magical papers were confiscated.This must have baffled Martha. Years earlier, Crowley had told her that thefirst country to adopt The Book of the Law would become the leader of the world.In 1925 Martha sent Das Buch des Gesetzes to Hitler, and later believed that hebased his ideas about National Socialism on it. Hitler, she believed, was hermagical son, but there is no evidence that Hitler ever got the book or read it.Although Crowley fell out with Martha because of Hitler—the Brits would, he toldher, knock the Führer for a loop—he also believed that Hitler had read The Bookof the Law. A copy of Hermann Rauschning’s Hitler Speaks (1940), annotated byCrowley and available at the Warburg Institute, shows that Crowley believed muchof Hitler’s “table talk” was thelemically inspired.17[index_split_019.html#filepos836223] Crowley himself tried to get the Britishand the Germans interested in thelema; he also, we’ve seen, tried to interestStalin.18 [index_split_019.html#filepos836537] It didn’t matter which nationadopted it; whichever one did would lead the New World Order. There are clearresonances between Crowley’s vision of a thelemic future and Hitler’s darkdreams, but this is not because Hitler was inspired by Crowley. Gerald Yorkeannotated a copy of Mein Kampf (1925–26), showing its similarities to Crowley’sphilosophy; Hitler wrote this while in prison after his failed “Beer HallPutsch,” and most likely did not have a copy of Das Buch des Gesetzes on hand.But he didn’t need to. Both he and Crowley fantasized about some master race,lording it over the masses, and both were enamored of the abyss of irrationalitythat lay latent in the western soul, and wanted to release it.—CROWLEY DRIFTED AROUND LONDON, an engaging dinner guest or a crashing bore,depending on your perspective. At one point he talked a young Cambridge studentinto letting him live rent free, in exchange for magical instruction. But theyeventually argued over money and Crowley had to go. He was invited to lunch bythe journalist Maurice Richardson, who then wrote an article, “Luncheon withBeast 666,” in which he portrayed Crowley as a heavy drinker and a “fearfulbore”; Crowley, Richardson recorded, could down three triple absinthes, a bottleof burgundy, and some brandies without batting an eye, and needed half a pint ofether to get going in the morning.19 [index_split_019.html#filepos836692] Healso said that Crowley’s bald head resembled an “enormous penis.”20[index_split_019.html#filepos836860] Crowley later returned the favor andinvited Richardson to lunch. Crowley provided an impressive spread and at theend Richardson felt sheepish about his article and apologized. Crowley askedthat if he really felt that way, would he mind writing a brief apology?Richardson declined, saying he was too drunk to write. Crowley suggested thatthey have lunch again soon. Richardson then realized that if he had written theapology, Crowley could have used it as an admission that he had slandered him,and taken him to court. Even after his debacle with Nina Hamnett, Crowley stillhad the taste for litigation. After a party Crowley threw at the Café Royal, heexcused himself to use the gents, then headed to Regent Street, where he caughta cab and sped away. He stiffed the restaurant £100 and was not welcome thereagain.21 [index_split_019.html#filepos837019] He had a certain talent forburning bridges.For the novelist Anthony Powell, who used Crowley as a character in one of hisbooks, he was like a music hall comedian, keeping up a “steady flow of ponderousgags.” For the writer Arthur Calder-Marshall, who had invited Crowley to lectureto the Oxford Poetry Society, Crowley was “a shagged and sorry old gentlemantrying to outstare me across a table.” Before their meeting Crowley had lookedup Calder-Marshall in Who’s Who and saw that his family had money; he wonderedif Arthur had too and invited him to stay the night. He was still hunting forScarlet Women, but he was, understandably, losing his touch. One catch thatescaped him was the Portuguese beauty and wealthy socialite Greta Sequeira, whowas part of the Café Royal set. Crowley met her in 1936 and pursued her off andon; at one point in 1938 he journeyed to Cornwall in order to dine with her.22[index_split_019.html#filepos837251] She liked Crowley, but like many shecultivated him as an unusual acquaintance and rebuffed his advances. Gretabecame friends with Pat Doherty, and she also fell in love with Robin Thynne andwas a follower of Rudolf Steiner. Many of the people who became involved withCrowley at this point had occult or esoteric interests outside the thelemicfold. Many felt that they could learn something from the Beast, but they alsofelt it was a good idea to keep a certain distance from him.—ON SEPTEMBER 1, 1939, England declared war on Germany. Much has been writtenabout Crowley’s involvement in intelligence work during World War II.23[index_split_019.html#filepos837628] It is difficult to determine how much istrue, how much is speculation, and how much is a good story. The standard reportis that Tom Driberg, an MI5 spy who would turn Russian double agent, introducedCrowley to the pulp novelist Dennis Wheatley. Wheatley is practically unknown inAmerica but in the UK he was a bestselling author of sensational thrillers, andhis most famous work, The Devil Rides Out (1934), features a magician based onCrowley. Wheatley was friends with Maxwell Knight, a high-ranking BritishIntelligence officer; Knight is said to have been Driberg’s chief. Knight wasfascinated with the occult but also had a professional interest in keeping aneye on various occult societies, and on Crowley in particular; he seems to havebeen an eccentric character himself, sharing his Pimlico flat with a baboon anda tame bear, which he took for walks along the King’s Road.24[index_split_019.html#filepos838312] It’s been said that Wheatley introducedCrowley to Knight, who considered using him as an operative, but there aredoubts about this.25 [index_split_019.html#filepos838519] Ian Fleming, thecreator of James Bond, also worked in British Intelligence. He had an idea touse Crowley as a disinformation agent in order to capture one of the Nazi highcommand. The plan was to smuggle Crowley into Germany, where he would feedRudolf Hess—one of the few top-ranking Nazis with a real interest in theoccult—occult misinformation, and suggest that there were people in Britainready to overthrow Churchill and make peace with Germany. Hess—ironically afollower of Rudolf Steiner, who was on the “hit list” of the early Nazigroups—was himself eager to broker a peace, but his sudden flight to Britain inMay 1941 put an end to this plan (some accounts say that the plan worked andHess’s flight was the result). Fleming then proposed that Crowley interrogateHess in prison. Knight is said to have agreed but Fleming’s immediate superiorrejected the idea. Fleming is supposed to have based Le Chiffre, the villain inCasino Royale (1953), the first James Bond novel, on Crowley, while “M,” Bond’ssuperior, is based on Knight.Crowley is also said to have taken part in “occult warfare,” supposedlyperforming ceremonies in Ashdown Forest, with Winston Churchill no less, burningNazi effigies to keep England safe from invasion, but this is surely legend. Iftrue, however, he was not alone; during the Battle of Britain, Dion Fortune,probably the most important magician in England after Crowley, conducted ritualsat the Bayswater headquarters of her Fraternity of Light—a late Golden Dawnoffshoot—aimed at repelling the Luftwaffe.26[index_split_019.html#filepos839670] Crowley’s patriotism took center stageduring the war years. He composed a rousing poem, “England, Stand Fast!” andliked to pose as Churchill, wrapped in a thick scarf, puffing on an enormouscigar.27 [index_split_019.html#filepos839875] Crowley even claimed to haveinvented the “V for Victory” sign. Crowley had used the V in his occult work andintended to use it as the symbol for his proposed “Union of Men,” a magicalassociation that would defend Britain. Crowley’s Union did not come together andthe use of the V sign in World War II most likely originated with the formerBelgian Minister of Justice and BBC broadcaster Victor Auguste de Laveleye, whothe official BBC account credits with first using the “V for Victory” idea inJanuary 1941.28 [index_split_019.html#filepos840098] Crowley claimed that hepassed the idea on to “a bloke” at the BBC before this and also to Churchillthrough his contacts at MI5, but there is no evidence of this.29[index_split_019.html#filepos840255] Crowley, however, had a penchant to claimcredit for many things; he even suggested that Hitler got the idea for theswastika from him. If so, the Führer was not very grateful. During the Blitz,William Joyce, aka Lord Haw-Haw, like Crowley a pro-German English propagandist,suggested in a radio broadcast that rather than hold church services inWestminster Abbey in order to receive divine protection, Crowley should performa Black Mass.—CROWLEY’S LAST MAJOR WORK was The Book of Thoth (1944), his essay on the tarot.Crowley’s artist collaborator on this project was Lady Frieda Harris, a friendof Greta Sequeira’s and the wife of the Liberal politician Percy Harris. Crowleywas introduced to Lady Harris in 1937 by the writer Clifford Bax, after he hadasked Bax if he knew an artist who could put his ideas on canvas. Harris, aneccentric social butterfly, was—like Robin Thynne, Pat Doherty, and GretaSequeira—a follower of Rudolf Steiner. She took lessons in Steiner’s “projectivegeometry” from Olive Whicher and George Adams, authors of the classic The PlantBetween Sun and Earth (1952), and incorporated Steiner’s ideas into her work.30[index_split_019.html#filepos841172]Frieda was only two years younger than Crowley and so did not become his lover.But she was interested in the occult and looked to him as a teacher; she alsoprovided him with a stipend during their collaboration, although at one pointCrowley got into a legal dispute with her—it had become something of a habitwith him. Crowley worked her hard, and many of the paintings had to be doneseveral times to receive his approval; the entire project took some seven years.For thelemites it is the last word on the tarot, but many non-Crowleyites findit too powerful, or too full of Crowley’s predilections. As with everything elsefrom his hand, it is full of thelemic ideas. Crowley includes passages from TheVision and the Voice and The Book of the Law in his text and reverses the orderof some cards in order to meet the requirements of the new aeon. This liberty,Crowley argues, is sanctioned by the Secret Chiefs. According to him, they wishto “put forward certain particular aspects of the Universe; to establish certaindoctrines; to declare certain modes of working, proper to the existing politicalsituations.”31 [index_split_019.html#filepos841452] Crowley, being “charged withthe guardianship of the human race,” has the authority to “modify” the pack whenhe deems appropriate.32 [index_split_019.html#filepos841655]Crowley’s central belief, that the tarot originated in Egypt and that it isbased on Kabbalah’s Tree of Life—an idea originating in Paris with Court deGébelin in 1781—is rejected by most modern historians.33[index_split_019.html#filepos841781] But this hardly matters; whatever the realorigin of the tarot, Crowley’s Thoth deck exerts an unmistakable power. AndCrowley’s text—in equal parts lucid, convoluted, and turgid—has an equallymesmeric force. At times it reminds me of Jung’s early work Symbols ofTransformation (1912), the book that ended his friendship with Freud. Both workshave a tendency to lose themselves in their wealth of illustrations andallusions, until the reader has forgotten what set off a particular spiral ofinterpretation. But this may be unimportant; one is irresistibly carried alongby the flow of Crowley’s occult erudition. The Fool, for example, takes us fromthe formula of Tetragrammaton to the Green Man, to the Holy Ghost, to Percivale,to the Egyptian god Set, to Hoor-Pa-Kraat, and so on to Baphomet. It is at timesa striking but also baffling exposition. The idea is to learn how to see theworld as Crowley does. Every idea, every symbol, he tells us, contains itscontradictory meaning. “One must,” he says, “keep in mind the bivalence of everysymbol. Insistence upon either one or the other of the contradictoryattributes . . . is simply a mark of spiritual incapacity.”34[index_split_019.html#filepos842007] We are, of course, in a kind of dreamworld, where the strictures of logic do not apply.Crowley’s work on the tarot kept him going through the Blitz. Just before thebombs fell he moved to Richmond, a leafy suburb of London. Here he enjoyed thecompany of Charles Cammell; like Israel Regardie, Cammell was appalled bySymonds’s book and wrote his own biography of Crowley in reply. Cammell did notthink much of thelema or magick—as noted, he threw his copy of The Book of theLaw into the fire—but he appreciated Crowley as a poet and man of the world. Hefelt that while thelema looked good on paper, “it loses significance in thelimelight of the philosopher’s application thereof to his own life.”35[index_split_019.html#filepos842163] Cammell also believed that Crowley’stroubles started because he broke his Abramelin oath to use his powers only forgood, and he made the interesting observation that John Dee had received asimilar message from a “spiritual creature” as Crowley had from Aiwass: “Do thatwhich most pleaseth you.”36 [index_split_019.html#filepos842370]Cammell had met Crowley in 1936 and won his friendship by surviving one ofCrowley’s fiery curries. Like Gurdjieff and Jung, Crowley was a good cook; theWarburg collection even includes some of his recipes. Crowley enjoyed feedingguests blazing dishes and watching them sweat. When Cammell washed down apyrotechnical repast with hefty swallows of vodka and then asked for more, theBeast was undone. In Richmond Crowley lived on Petersham Road, near the Thames,and Cammell introduced him to Ralph Shirley, the editor of The Occult Review,and Montague Summers, the popular writer on witchcraft. Summers had followedCrowley’s career, collecting press cuttings and magazine articles about him;Crowley, he thought, was “one of the few original and really interesting men ofour age.”37 [index_split_019.html#filepos842492] Cammell says that Crowley wasliving with a black woman on Petersham Road, and this may be one reason why hehad to leave. Cammell found him a new flat on the Green, in the center of town,close to Cammell’s own flat. Crowley’s sex life was winding down. Alice Uphamwas Crowley’s last recorded lover; as with the other women in his life, theirrelationship was rocky. He had other lovers, too, but the long orgy was drawingto an end. On June 18, 1941, for the first time Crowley recorded that he failedto raise an erection. His last recorded opus was an act of cunnilingus withAlice at a flat in Hanover Square in October that year. He was sixty-six.Crowley enjoyed the bombings. Cammell records that one evening a German bomberhit by antiaircraft fire came crashing down. Cammell rushed out of his door andso did Crowley, waving his hands and shouting “Hooray!”38[index_split_019.html#filepos842618] But soon the Blitz proved too much andCrowley left London for Torquay in Devon—Cammell paid his fare—where apparentlyhe developed a reputation for propositioning the local ladies. But his healthsuffered and at one point Lady Harris found him half-dead from pneumonia;someone had even made arrangements for a coffin. Lady Harris found a doctor andnursed him back to health.39 [index_split_019.html#filepos842745] Another timewhen Crowley was again near death, Cammell rushed to his bedside. Cammell andCrowley’s nurse both insist that Crowley had died, and the doctor asked Cammellto make the necessary arrangements. But the next day Crowley had revived; theDevil, the nurse said, had called him back from the dead.40[index_split_019.html#filepos842872] (For what it’s worth, Madame Blavatsky,Gurdjieff, and Jung suffered similar resurrections.) While in Torquay, Crowleyinvestigated Barton Cross, near Plymouth, as a potential site for a new abbey,but like many of these projects, it didn’t materialize. Crowley eventually brokewith Cammell over money. Crowley asked Cammell’s wife to purchase some fabricfor him; when she asked to be reimbursed, he refused, as usual making up someexcuse. “Money,” Cammell notes, “never meant anything to him,” and “whenchallenged, he became defiant.”41 [index_split_019.html#filepos843031] Cammellthen joined the ranks of people who truly liked Crowley, but who the Beastinvariably drove away.—WHEN THE BLITZ was over Crowley returned to London, where he moved from room toroom. Lodgings in the bombed-out capital were scarce, but at one point Crowleyhelped the heiress Nancy Cunard find a flat. Later her landlord named a roomafter Crowley and used it to hold séances. In June 1941, an exhibition of LadyHarris’s tarot paintings was scheduled for an Oxford gallery, but it wascancelled because of Crowley’s connection. Another exhibition was arranged, butHarris felt it politic not to mention Crowley in the brochure. Understandably,Crowley was miffed, but with his reputation, it was difficult securing backersfor a show. Harris also disapproved of his pamphlet Liber Oz, written in NewYork during World War I and now brought out as a broadside. It states hispolitical stance with strident brevity, and its libertarian ideas are not farremoved from those of Ayn Rand. Crowley, in fact, was a fan of Rand’s; in hislast days he spoke highly of The Fountainhead, remarking that his Americanfriends recognized him in the protagonist, Howard Roark.42[index_split_019.html#filepos843187] “Man has the right to live by his own law,”Crowley declares. He has the right to work, play, rest, die, and love as hewill, and he has the right “to kill those who would thwart these rights.”43[index_split_019.html#filepos843490] The essence of these “rights of man” is thesame as Crowley’s earliest desire to “let me go my own way,” the adolescent needto “do what I want to do” without interference.44[index_split_019.html#filepos843652] Like the oft-quoted line from his poem“Hymn to Lucifer”—“The Key of Joy is Disobedience”—Crowley’s “rights of man”remind us that Crowley never grew up.45 [index_split_019.html#filepos844175]This is one of the truly remarkable things about him. Crowley swallowed enoughexperience to fill a dozen lives yet he emerges from it all exactly as he began.He remains a colossal example of arrested development.At this time Crowley was known to wander around Fitzrovia, reeking of ether,happy to relate his exploits for a drink. On one occasion in early 1942 hefrightened the poet Dylan Thomas with a demonstration of mind reading. At theFrench House—a famous watering hole—he handed Thomas some paper, asked him todraw something, and then left. Shortly after Crowley presented Thomas with anexact copy of his handiwork. Thomas, a Welshman, knew second sight when he sawit and ran from the place. A young Peter Brook, later a prestigious filmmakerand stage director, saw a copy of Magick in a bookshop on Charing Cross Road andwas intrigued enough to write to its author. Brook met Crowley at his flat inHamilton House, Piccadilly, where he found him “elderly, green-tweeded andcourteous.” Brook later persuaded Crowley to hide in his bedroom in Oxford;during the party that followed he manifested the aged magician to his fellowundergraduates’ delight. In 1944 Brook directed a production of ChristopherMarlowe’s Doctor Faustus; Crowley was his “occult advisor.”46[index_split_019.html#filepos844339] Although slowing down, Crowley remainedactive: he wrote a poem for the French Resistance, made wax recordings ofreadings of the “Hymn to Pan” and the first two calls of the Enochianaethyrs—his voice is rather high and sibilant—and even thought about composing anew national anthem for America.In the winter of 1943, Crowley set down at 93 Jermyn Street, Mayfair, an aptaddress. He liked his landlady, but she soon troubled him about things likerent. Most of Crowley’s income came from America, either from Karl Germer orfrom the O.T.O. branch in Pasadena, California. In the late 1930s, W. T. Smith,an initiate of Frater Achad’s Vancouver lodge, settled in the Golden State andstarted his own group, called Agape Lodge, in Hollywood. Jane Wolfe, who hadreturned to America, helped Smith. In 1943 Grady McMurtry, atwenty-nine-year-old lieutenant in the U.S. Army and initiate of the AgapeLodge, was stationed in England and visited Crowley often. McMurtry, likeCrowley, played chess—the game was one of Crowley’s last pleasures—and over onematch Crowley initiated McMurtry into the IX0 of the O.T.O., giving him, asmentioned earlier, the name Hymenaeus Alpha. (It was during a visit fromMcMurtry that Crowley bellowed “To the lions with them” at some Christmascarolers.) McMurtry contributed to The Book of Thoth’s publication; it appearedin 1944 in two hundred signed and numbered copies. They are now a rarecollector’s item.Crowley liked McMurtry and, ever in search of a magical heir—and concerned aboutthe state of the O.T.O. after his and Germer’s deaths—Crowley gave McMurtry therank of Sovereign Grand Inspector of the O.T.O. Crowley later authorizedMcMurtry to take control of the O.T.O. in the event of an emergency and declaredhim head of the society in the United States after Germer died. As usuallyhappens with occult societies, following Germer’s death, a leadership battle forthe O.T.O. ensued, and the controversy continued for some time.Crowley by this time was taking a potent medley of drugs: between four and sixgrains of heroin a day—he soon worked his way up to ten—as well as Veronal,ethyl oxide, cocaine, and other pharmaceuticals. His intake was so great that atone point he was visited by the police because of his many prescriptions. Hishealth was clearly fading. He had lost much weight; it is remarkable to seephotographs of his wizened, gnarled figure and recall the bloated hedonist ofyesterday. From the gourmand famous for his steaks and devilish curries Crowleywas reduced to a meager diet of biscuits, boiled eggs, milk, and heroin, alongwith alcohol. Crowley’s drink intake remained considerable. One story—possiblyapocryphal—tells of his hiding gin bottles in a friend’s toilet cistern during atwo-week visit. He accompanied her to town each day while she shopped andsurreptitiously charged a bottle to her account; he later stashed the empty inthe cistern. After he left, someone remarked that the toilet was faulty and oninspecting it, fourteen empties were found.—IN APRIL 1944, Crowley relocated to the Bell Inn at Aston Clinton,Buckinghamshire, leaving London for good. It was pleasant enough and he likedthe food, but Crowley ultimately found the place boring. There was nothing to doand no one to talk to. He had visitors—Alice Upham, Nancy Cunard, McMurtry, whothought he was “almost at the end of the road”—but most of his days he wasalone. His only distraction was work. Crowley had started corresponding with astudent, Anne Macky, explaining his occult philosophy. He suggested otherstudents join in and the correspondence grew into a kind of firesideintroduction to the thelemic way of life. He originally entitled this AleisterExplains Everything but it has come down to us as Magick Without Tears, firstpublished by Germer in 1954. Depending on your tastes it is either an unbuttonedentry into Crowley’s thought or a garrulous recycling of his earlier work. ColinWilson suggests it is the best introduction to Crowley’s ideas. It displaysCrowley’s “probing intellectual curiosity,” but, oddly, also one of hisdrawbacks, his incorrigible flippancy, which undermines his stature as a seriousthinker.47 [index_split_019.html#filepos844605]Crowley’s landlady at the Bell Inn didn’t care for him. He was a “phony” and“nuisance” who scared his nurse by asking her to sharpen a hatchet and who stolefood from the kitchen; the image of a wraithlike Crowley in his green plusfours, silver buckles, mandarin beard, and Tibetan bangles creeping out of thelarder with the sugar ration is, we must admit, charming (Crowley generally tooksix spoons of sugar with his tea and was very fond of sweets). She alsocomplained that his room stank. Crowley asked friends to find another locationand Louis Wilkinson passed the request on to his son. Oliver Wilkinsondiscovered that a fellow actor in a repertory theater did, in fact, run an“intellectual guest house” in Hastings. That a man who, as a boy, had beendetermined to kill Crowley because of the way he treated his mother should nowfind him a place to live says something about Crowley’s peculiar charisma;Wilkinson’s account is admirably balanced and even supplies examples ofCrowley’s infrequent generosity.48 [index_split_019.html#filepos844765] Mostlandlords considered the Beast a liability, but Vernon and Ellen Symonds, whoran the guesthouse, were delighted at having Crowley stay. In February 1945Crowley moved into the aptly named Netherwood, on the Ridge, Hastings, and herehe would die.—NETHERWOOD—a “large, somber, 19th-century mansion”—was not the usualguesthouse.49 [index_split_019.html#filepos844938] Its owners had bohemianbackgrounds, and their idea was to provide a pleasant atmosphere in whichartists, writers, and other creative individuals could enjoy a relaxing weekendwith good food, drink, and conversation. Among other guests were the philosopherC.E.M. Joad and the historian of science and author of The Ascent of Man (1973),Jacob Bronowski, both of whom were well known through the BBC radio show TheBrains Trust.As usual, Crowley knew how to make an entrance. A telegram preceding his arrivalannounced that “a consignment of frozen meat” was on its way. Meat was subjectto war rationing, and the local postman sent a copy of the telegram to the FoodMinistry, who sent people to inspect the shipment, due on February 1, 1945. Whenan ambulance turned up that day and the Beast appeared with fifty or so parcelsof books, it was clear he was the “frozen meat.”50[index_split_019.html#filepos845247] Crowley duly checked into room number 13.He looked old and frail, and his landlords thought him more vulnerable thanmenacing. One of the first things he did was top up his heroin supply—severaldoctors prescribed it for him—and one of his first visitors was Kenneth Grant.Grant, who was to become an influential occultist in his own right, came uponCrowley’s Magick in a bookshop in 1939 when he was fifteen.51[index_split_019.html#filepos845387] He was already passionate about the occult,and at eighteen he volunteered for the army, hoping to be sent to India, wherehe intended to find a guru. Grant’s grasp on reality was somewhat romantic; henever reached the subcontinent and left the service for obscure reasons in 1944.Grant tried to contact Crowley through his publishers; failing that, he askedMichael Houghton of the Atlantis Bookshop to help. Houghton refused, because, hesaid, Grant was “mentally unstable,” but Grant believed Houghton wanted torecruit him for his own magical society.52 [index_split_019.html#filepos845587]Most likely Houghton was just miffed at Crowley. Crowley considered Houghton“the meanest thief alive” and made anti-Semitic remarks about him.53[index_split_019.html#filepos845712]Grant eventually met Crowley and, as had Israel Regardie, became his unpaidfactotum. By spring 1945, Grant moved into a cottage on the grounds ofNetherwood; one of his first missions was to get new needles for Crowley’s dailyinjections.54 [index_split_019.html#filepos845838] Crowley’s heroin use causedsome consternation. Once he left his works at the men’s room of the local chessclub (he beat the local champ easily but his reputation precluded his joining);another time he upset McMurtry by excusing himself to take an injection, thensquealing like “a stuck pig” from behind the bathroom door.55[index_split_019.html#filepos845964]Grant learned much from the master. He took lessons in ether-fueled astraltraveling and also in how to extract money from relatives, but his performanceas a secretary left much to be desired.56 [index_split_019.html#filepos846109]Grant was a dreamy, poetic soul—he wrote some effective occult fiction—andCrowley reprimanded him for his inability to “be content with the simplicity ofreality and fact; you have to go off into a pipe dream”—something Grant’sdetractors also point out, especially about his claim to having a bloodconnection to Crowley.57 [index_split_019.html#filepos846235] But Crowley didsee Grant as a potential successor, at least in the UK, regarding him as a“trained man to take care of the O.T.O.”58 [index_split_019.html#filepos846460]This would lead to complications. Grant revised and added much to Crowley’sideas—he was, for example, the first to link Crowley’s magick with the weirdfiction of H. P. Lovecraft, in his influential book The Magical Revival(1972)—and this earned him the enmity of Karl Germer, who excommunicated him.59[index_split_019.html#filepos846640] After Germer’s death, Grant declaredhimself O.H.O., but was challenged by Grady McMurtry, who eventually secured thetitle. Grant went on to form his own offshoot, the Typhonian Order. He died in2011.Grant’s apprenticeship with the Beast was short-lived; after only a few months,his parents compelled him to leave Crowley. They wished him to find more secureemployment, but Crowley thought he was “giving up his real future.” Most likelyGrant himself found Crowley’s demands endless, and no doubt wanted to pursue hisown path.60 [index_split_019.html#filepos847681]—SOME OF CROWLEY’S LIFE at Netherwood sounds idyllic. After breakfast the Beastwalked in the garden in his scarlet blazer and purple slippers and hislandlord’s niece and nephew hid in the bushes and watched as he made hisadoration to the sun. He spent much time in his room. He ate dinner there, wouldsleep during the day then stay up reading and writing; his correspondence wasvoluminous. He scared the housekeeper when he told her he had seen her flying ona broomstick; she did not care for him and thought the sooner he died, thebetter. Another housekeeper complained that he used all the hot water. At achildren’s birthday party he appeared in turban and sash with a jeweled daggerand many rings; but he performed no tricks and the kids were not impressed.His followers in America sent him supplies, delicacies unavailable in Britain,but not all was well in California. In 1939 Jack Whiteside Parsons, a founder ofthe Pasadena Jet Propulsion Laboratory, joined the Agape Lodge. Soon Parsons wascorresponding with the Beast, addressing him as “Most Beloved Father” andsigning his letters “Thy son, John.” Jack encouraged his wife, Helen, to do whatshe wilt; she did, and turned her affections toward W. T. Smith. Parsons was nottroubled; he found a willing replacement in Helen’s sister Betty. When Parsonsinformed Crowley of this development, the Beast was concerned that Smith wasturning the O.T.O. into just another “love cult,” and he arranged for Smith toabdicate his leadership in favor of Parsons. Parsons, who showed keen magicalpromise, took control and moved the lodge’s Hollywood temple to his mansion onSouth Orange Grove Avenue in Pasadena. Things went well until the arrival of L.Ron Hubbard, then a pulp science-fiction writer on his way to inventingDianetics and the more successful Scientology. Hubbard claimed that NavalIntelligence had sent him to Pasadena to break up a dangerous black magic ring.Parsons, after all, was a real-life rocket scientist—there is in fact a crateron the moon named after him; appropriately it is on the dark side—but Hubbardhad more likely heard about the “free love” parties given at Parsons’ mansionand thought to check them out. Parsons was a sci-fi fan—he knew the writerRobert Heinlein—and word of his Pasadena occult house parties no doubt gotaround at the Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society meetings that he attended.61[index_split_019.html#filepos847854]One of the first things Hubbard did was to attract and secure Betty’sattentions. Parsons, of course, was beyond jealousy, but he was coming underHubbard’s spell, too. He told Crowley that Hubbard was “the most thelemic personI have ever met”; Hubbard had much natural magical ability and was, Parsonsbelieved, in contact with his Holy Guardian Angel.62[index_split_019.html#filepos848175] Parsons did not let his being cuckoldedinterfere with the supreme ritual he had in mind, and in which he asked Hubbardto participate. Like Crowley, Parsons wanted to create a magical child, and todo so he needed his own Scarlet Woman. Parsons used the O.T.O. VIII0 method ofmagical masturbation—perhaps making a virtue of necessity—and with Prokofiev’sViolin Concerto hammering in the background, threw himself into a trance, whileHubbard related events on the Astral Plane.63[index_split_019.html#filepos848333] After many inconclusive attempts, Parsonssucceeded. Returning with Hubbard from the Mojave Desert, Parsons discoveredthat his Scarlet Woman had turned up, in the form of Marjorie Cameron, who waslater to star in Kenneth Anger’s thelemic masterpiece, Inauguration of thePleasure Dome (1954).64 [index_split_019.html#filepos848617]Marjorie had the red hair, green eyes, and intelligence Parsons was looking for,but it was her imperious manner that sold him; Parsons, like Crowley, enjoyedbeing dominated. His relationship with Hubbard suggests this; around the timeMarjorie showed up, Parsons had given a considerable sum to Hubbard and Betty,as an investment in a business deal. Hubbard and Betty made off with the money,which Parsons never saw again.65 [index_split_019.html#filepos848882] It’s beensaid that Hubbard learned everything he knew from Crowley, and there is reasonto believe this is true.When Parsons told Crowley about Marjorie, the Beast was pleased. He had, infact, been working to bring about this very meeting; Crowley told Parsons that“for some little time past I have been endeavoring to intervene personally onyour behalf.”66 [index_split_019.html#filepos849045] With Marjorie on board,what Parsons called the Babalon Working began in earnest. After three days ofIX0 exertions—often on a sheet smeared with menstrual blood and with Hubbardscrying in the background—Parsons believed they had achieved success. Parsonswrote Crowley a wild, incoherent letter, speaking of the “most important,devastating experience” of his life. The Beast wasn’t impressed. He wrote thathe hadn’t “the slightest idea” what Parsons could mean, and complained to Germerthat Parsons, or Hubbard, or “somebody is producing a Moonchild. I get fairlyfrantic when I contemplate the idiocy of these goats.”67[index_split_019.html#filepos849199] And when Crowley learned of Hubbard’sswindle, he told Germer that Hubbard was clearly playing a confidence trick, andthat Parsons was a weak fool, losing both his money and his girl.68[index_split_019.html#filepos849326] Parsons eventually broke with Hubbard,Betty, Crowley, and the O.T.O.; in his last letters he calls Crowley “DearAleister,” a strange echo of Leah Hirsig’s epistolary detachment. Parsonscontinued his own magick, changed his name to Belarion Armiluss Al DajjalAntichrist, and increasingly slipped into dissociative states. On June 17, 1952,he blew himself up in what was apparently an accident in his chemicallaboratory.Crowley suffered all the complaints of old age—diarrhea, constipation, insomnia,and general decrepitude—and on one occasion he congratulated himself on beingable to get to his barber, bookshop, and printer all by bus and all in one day;he also recorded the embarrassment of needing to urinate but not getting home intime.69 [index_split_019.html#filepos849458] But his main concern was seeing hisunpublished work to print; he had eight books in mind and wanted at least twoper year to appear. He would be disappointed. Olla: An Anthology of Sixty Yearsof Song (1946) was the last of his books published in his lifetime. It sported acover portrait by Frieda Harris and a frontispiece by his old friend the artistAugustus John; Harris’s portrait shows Crowley as a kind of Oriental sage, butJohn’s has a look of surprise, even dismay. Olla is Crowley’s testament topoetry and is not for all tastes. Crowley himself had no patience with modernpoetry; T. S. Eliot’s The Waste Land (1922)—which, ironically, incorporates muchoccult erudition—“nauseated” him.70 [index_split_019.html#filepos849599] (Someof Crowley’s more recent biographers have tried to relaunch him as a modernist,but there is no evidence for that.) Of other works that did not see print untilafter his death, Liber Aleph: The Book of Wisdom and Folly was finally publishedin 1961. Frieda Harris relates that Crowley kept £500 of O.T.O. donations underhis bed, reserved solely for publishing his work; he wouldn’t touch it, andfinally did only after Harris convinced him that it was all right to do so.71[index_split_019.html#filepos849754]Crowley enjoyed the cinema; at one point he wanted to see The Wizard of Oz butwas disappointed when told it was a children’s story. He told a correspondentthat it had nothing to do with his Liber Oz but that he wouldn’t change thetitle of his book “because some filthy Jew in Hollywood chose to pinch theword.”72 [index_split_019.html#filepos849895] (Apparently he was unaware of thesuccess of L. Frank Baum, a theosophist.) But his main source of diversion washis guests. Many people came to see the Beast in his last lair; for a fullaccount the reader should look to Netherwood: The Last Resort of AleisterCrowley, which recounts Crowley’s last days in detail. On December 16, 1945,David Curwen, a furrier and alchemist, was the last person Crowley initiatedinto the IX0 O.T.O.; Louis Wilkinson, who was initiated himself only the daybefore, attended. Curwen bought the two-year subscription that Crowley demanded,but was disappointed; he received no new knowledge or introductions to othermembers. He eventually broke with Crowley; he felt he had been taken in, but wasalso unhappy that Jews couldn’t be full O.T.O. members.73[index_split_019.html#filepos850416] Curwen later drifted toward Kenneth Grantand became involved with Grant’s own occult operations.Crowley’s first visitor of 1946 was the Cambridge scholar E. M. Butler, whoarrived on New Year’s Day. She was researching her book The Myth of the Magus(1948). Butler’s impressions were not positive. She found Crowley “a seedyfigure in light tweed knickerbockers” whose “grating voice” intoned the Law.Crowley was “disintegrating,” “surrounded by an aura of physical corruption.” Hewas “more repulsive” than she had expected, and his voice—pedantic, pretentious,fretful, scratchy—was the worst thing about him.74[index_split_019.html#filepos850548] She thought thelema “insane,” and Crowley’sroom squalid and airless, like something out of Kafka. The only danger she feltwas that of “prolonged boredom mixed with repugnance and pity.” But Crowley wasecstatic that a scholar had come to speak to him; Butler had spent a long dayand had asked many questions and he had answered at length. Butler, he recorded,spoke to him with “sympathy, consideration and understanding”; her visit was a“dream of joy.” “If all days could be like this!”75[index_split_019.html#filepos850746] In the end, Butler merely name-checksCrowley in her book.Another scholar to visit Crowley was Richard Ellmann, who was writing a bookabout Yeats; he was interested in speaking with Crowley about his magical battlewith his rival poet. Ellmann’s Yeats: The Man and the Masks (1948) remains aclassic biography of Crowley’s old nemesis. The poet and translator MichaelHamburger visited Crowley and was impressed by his “sheer physical stamina,”amazed that he was not only alive but “active and vigorous.”76[index_split_019.html#filepos850886] James Laver, curator at the Victorian andAlbert Museum, and author of a book on Nostradamus, visited Crowley; he enjoyedthe brandy that the Beast offered and noticed flecks of blood on hisshirtsleeves. Crowley told Laver that “magic is something we do to ourselves,”explaining, however, that it is “more convenient to assume the objectiveexistence of an Angel who gives us new knowledge than to allege that ourinvocation has awakened a supernatural power in ourselves,” a remark thatcontradicts what he always claimed was his key discovery, the reality of“discarnate intelligence.”77 [index_split_019.html#filepos851013] FredericMellinger, a German actor who had emigrated to America and returned to postwarGermany, also visited Crowley; he had joined W. T. Smith’s Agape Lodge in 1940.He came bearing gifts and helped the Beast tidy his room.78[index_split_019.html#filepos851140]On a more magical note, Gerald Gardner, the modern exponent of witchcraft, andauthor of Witchcraft Today (1954), visited Crowley. Gardner found him a “frail,gentle, archdeaconish figure.” “Could this be the Great Beast who had onceboasted so many followers; who had thundered his way through life?” Gardnerwondered. Gardner was not sure about Crowley’s powers, but he believed Crowleybelieved in them, and that “this delusion enabled him to exploit many people.”Nevertheless Gardner was initiated into the O.T.O.; as it did with Grant andMcMurtry, after Crowley’s death this led to some confusion. For a time he wassaddled with being O.H.O., but Gardner did not really care for sex magick or theO.T.O. and soon abandoned it for his own predilections, which includedscourging. Much has been speculated about Crowley’s influence on Gardner’sWicca; one apocryphal tale has Gardner paying Crowley £300 to write his Book ofShadows, the collection of writings making up the Wiccan liturgy. That Gardnerborrowed material from Crowley is fairly clear, but that Crowley was initiatedinto a witch cult in 1900, as Gardner claimed, is rejected by most researchers.Gardner, like Crowley, was a self-mythologist and teller of tales, somethingtrue of many people interested in the occult.One visit to Netherwood most likely did not take place. In 1919 Dion Fortune,the magical name of Violet Firth, was initiated into the Alpha and Omega, aGolden Dawn offshoot led by Moina Mathers. A rivalry between the two began andFortune left to pursue her own path. By the 1930s, Fortune was one of the mostrespected modern occultists; her The Mystical Qabalah (1935) remains a classicintroduction to the magical tradition, and she was also the author of severalvery readable works of occult fiction, one of which, The Winged Bull (1935),features the black magician Hugo Astley, based on Crowley. Crowley had seen herlecture in London in 1939, and recorded that she was “like a hippo with falseteeth,” and her talk a “bubbling of tinned tomato soup.”79[index_split_019.html#filepos851267] Nevertheless, in 1942 they begancorresponding, and continued to do so while Crowley was at Netherwood. KennethGrant relates that Fortune visited Crowley on two occasions while he waspresent, and on others after that; he also refers to her as “the magical Shaktiof the new aeon”—Shakti being the consort of the god Shiva, meaning that she,Fortune, was Crowley’s magical partner. There is, however, no mention ofFortune’s visits in Crowley’s diaries; this is strange, as Crowley recordedanything of note in his journals. There was a considerable correspondencebetween Crowley and Fortune; much of this was, sadly, subsequently destroyed. Inone letter Fortune appears to accept Crowley’s new aeon, but reserves the rightto announce this in her own time and asks Crowley to keep silent about it untilthen. This letter, however, is reproduced in Grant’s memoir, and itsauthenticity may be suspect.80 [index_split_019.html#filepos851412] Crowley alsotold Frederic Mellinger that before her death in January 1946, Fortune hadreached an “arrangement” with him, in which she acknowledged his authority, butwas forced to keep silent because of “the old nonsense which was knocked topieces in Crowley v. Constable.”81 [index_split_019.html#filepos851578] There isno evidence for this “arrangement” outside of Crowley’s account, and as we’veseen, the only thing knocked to pieces in his libel trial was Crowley himself.Crowley, we know, often tried to take over other occult groups—he did this withthe O.T.O., and we remember his attempt to get Annie Besant to recognize hissupremacy—so this may be just another example of his esoteric imperialism. It ispossible that Fortune, recognizing Crowley’s magical geniuses—she acknowledgeshis influence in The Mystical Qabalah—wanted to please him, and told him what hewanted to hear. She may have known that, like herself, he was not long for thisworld; by the time of her alleged visits she was diagnosed with leukemia. Granthimself said she had lost her vigor and was close to death.But probably Crowley’s favorite visitor was his son, Ataturk, who turned up withhis mother on May 15, 1947, a few months before Crowley’s death. Crowley hadlast seen them ten years earlier, during a holiday in Cornwall. Ataturk was nowten. Crowley was moved by his son’s and Pat’s sudden appearance—he told acorrespondent that he had “given them up for dead”—and he wrote Ataturk aletter, spelling out what he expected of him and giving him advice. It is atouching if bizarre document. Like every other letter Crowley wrote, he prefacedit with the Law. Crowley tells Ataturk how happy he is to see him, and assureshim that from now on he will watch over his career. He is very happy thatAtaturk is learning to read. That Ataturk was ten, and that Pat was a followerof Rudolf Steiner, suggests that Steiner’s ideas about reading—that it shouldn’tbe taught until after the age of seven—may have had something to do withAtaturk’s late start. Crowley informs Ataturk of his supposed ancestry—the deQuérouaille line—and insists that he be “high-minded, generous, noble” and neverlie. He urges Ataturk to learn Latin: it is his destiny to become an educatedgentleman. He should also learn chess, and read the Bible and Shakespeare;through these he can develop good style in writing. Grammar, syntax, and logicare indispensable. Crowley closes as his “affectionate father,” after remindingAtaturk that “Love is the law, love under will.”82[index_split_019.html#filepos851705]It would not be a usual letter if it were written during Crowley’s own childhoodand if Ataturk had not had two stepfathers during the last decade. During thewar, Pat had married James McAlpine, an army officer who worked for BritishIntelligence. After he died on a mission, Pat married again, and she also hadseveral “open” relationships.83 [index_split_019.html#filepos851908] But for aten-year-old who did not remember his father—he was only a year old when Crowleylast saw him—it seems an odd missive. How much Ataturk followed his father’sadvice is unclear, but his subsequent career was, like that of his father’s,checkered.84 [index_split_019.html#filepos852036]Yet undoubtedly the most important visitor to Netherwood was John Symonds, whosebiography of Crowley, more than anything else, saved him from oblivion. CliffordBax broke the ice, and Symonds headed to Netherwood with the astrologer RupertGleadow. Bax himself first met Crowley in 1904 at the age of eighteen, over achess match in St. Moritz, not long after Crowley’s revelation in Cairo. Bax hadan interest in theosophy and later, edited a magazine, The Golden Hind, with theoccult artist Austin Osman Spare. Symonds knew of Victor Neuburg—indeed, helived in his flat—and wanted to do an article on Neuburg’s guru. His firstimpression of the aged Beast on May 3, 1946, was not positive. Crowley had apained, puzzled expression, a fussy voice, a skull-like head, and seemed utterlyexhausted. He also exuded a peculiar odor, Abramelin oil mixed with old age andpossibly ether, and had a strange air of remoteness, of being far removed fromhuman concerns. On being told that Gleadow was an astrologer, Crowley remarkedthat astrology was only “a fraction of one per cent” true. They spoke about theend of the world, and Crowley delivered an impromptu lecture, ending in his ownrevelation about the new aeon of “force and fire.” What struck Symonds most wasCrowley’s heroin intake; he was, Symonds says, taking enough—eleven grains—to“kill a roomful of people.”85 [index_split_019.html#filepos852163] But Crowleymust have thought well of Symonds. He made him one of his literaryexecutors—Louis Wilkinson was the other—a decision thelemites have regrettedever since.Symonds, as noted, took a critical view of Crowley and his book is anathema tothe Beast’s followers. Most biographies subsequent to The Great Beast (1951) area response to it, attempts at rectifying Symonds’s tongue-in-cheek account. Thisis fair, but it has to be admitted, I think, that Symonds’s remains the bestwritten account of Crowley’s life. It is by far the most readable. Symonds isbiased, yes; he didn’t like the Beast and admitted that he “hoped to make a nameand fortune over Crowley.”86 [index_split_019.html#filepos852323] But this iswhat any writer hopes when he has found a good story. Symonds himself wassurprised at the reaction to his book, and was appalled that by the 1960s, the“love generation” had taken Crowley up as a hero—he was, himself, much moreconservative and health-minded than his subject, and he did not like thehippies.87 [index_split_019.html#filepos852464] But without his first, howeverflawed, account, most likely neither the hippies nor anyone else would haveknown of Crowley at all. And perhaps neither would we.Crowley turned seventy-two in October 1947. One of his last visitors was LouisWilkinson, who noted a certain pathos in his old friend. Crowley noted it, too,and apologized to Louis; “I am sorry,” he said, “you have wasted your time invisiting a log.” It was clear to Wilkinson that Crowley’s powers were failing.It was also clear that Crowley knew his life had been, if not a failure,something less than a success. He had not done what he wanted to do; at best,only part of it, and he had acquired infamy rather than fame. There wassomething in this unspoken admission that, Wilkinson said, made Crowley lovable:the Beast revealed himself as a man, a troubled one, who had no chance left toput things right.88 [index_split_019.html#filepos852775]Much has been written about Crowley’s final days. There are conflicting reportsabout who was with him, what happened, and what his last words were. The mostfamous account is that, with tears running down his cheeks, he told FriedaHarris, “I am perplexed,” and drifted off.89[index_split_019.html#filepos852929] But this is now considered apocryphal.Another account has it that Lady Harris was not with him and that his last wordswere “Sometimes I hate myself.”90 [index_split_019.html#filepos853084] Anotheraccount has someone on the floor below him hearing him pace—as was his wont—andthen hearing a sudden crash. When he rushed to Crowley’s room, the Beast wasdead.91 [index_split_019.html#filepos853225] There is a persistent story that,as Crowley’s body lay quiet, someone stole his gold watch.92[index_split_019.html#filepos853347] According to Pat Doherty, who was atNetherwood when Crowley died, there was no deathbed contrition, no confessions,no regrets. Crowley died happily and peacefully and, as a good occult storyshould have it, a gust of wind kicked up and thunder boomed as he gave up theghost.93 [index_split_019.html#filepos853502] Crowley’s life was a complicatedmix of truth, half-truth, bad press, and a good yarn, and there is no reason whyhis death shouldn’t have been, too.Edward Alexander Crowley died on December 1, 1947, of myocardial degenerationand chronic bronchitis, exasperated by chronic heroin use—at least according tohis death certificate. Although he once again made the papers—this time theinternational press was sure he was dead—the local Hastings & St. LeonardObserver got a few things wrong. He was not seventy-three, and his last work wasnot titled 60 Years of Song. This hardly warranted litigation, but Crowley, hadhe known, could not have been chided for remarking, “Damned papers—they nevergot it right.” Among his effects, an Abramelin talisman, stained with menstrualblood and semen, was discovered in his wallet.94[index_split_019.html#filepos853643] The way to the Abyss had opened, and Nuithad taken back her own."},{"pageContent":"ELEVENTHE BEAST GOES ON> [images/00004.jpg] Aleister Crowley’s remains were cremated at Brighton Cemetery on December 5,1947. Reports of the attendees at his memorial service differ, but we can besure that a small group was there, and that among them numbered Gerald Yorke;Frieda Harris; John Symonds; Patricia MacAlpine and Crowley’s son, Ataturk;Kenneth Grant and his wife, Steffi; and also the poet Kenneth Hopkins, a friendof Louis Wilkinson’s; as well as Wilkinson himself.1[index_split_019.html#filepos854411] If Crowley alone was not enough to make theoccasion something out of the ordinary, Wilkinson made sure the day would beremembered. Gerald Yorke was originally asked to read some of Crowley’s work,but at the last minute the task fell to Wilkinson. Crowley, we’ve seen, oftenthought about his death, or, perhaps more accurately, about the servicessurrounding his death. Like many egotistic Romantics, he fantasized about lavishmemorials and fantastic burials—Crowley, we know, wanted to be remembered forcenturies. In his last days he put together a collection of his works that hecalled The Last Ritual, and it was to the sound of this that he wanted to exitthis dreary plane. Wilkinson had some reputation as a public speaker and in hisfine voice, and after the inevitable declamation of the Law, he read extractsfrom The Book of the Law—he spared the mourners the proposed full text—as wellas some of Crowley’s poems and passages from his Gnostic Mass. Most unusual, atleast for the crematorium chapel’s attendants, was Crowley’s “Hymn to Pan,” acelebration of madness and Dionysian excess, which remains his most effectivework. As Wilkinson intoned “Io Pan! Io Pan Pan!” the small group chanted back“Io Pan!” Following his reading Wilkinson reminded the mourners that “Love isthe law, love under will.” Patricia then placed some red roses on the coffin,and the body of the Great Beast made its way to the flames. On the way back toNetherwood, or so the story goes, a thunderstorm blew up and lightning flared.“That’s just what Crowley would have liked!” Louis Wilkinson announced in thecab.2 [index_split_019.html#filepos854687] It was only after reading newspaperreports of the service that the Brighton city council—again, so the storygoes—declared it would take steps to assure its taxpayers that such a scenewould never happen again, at least not in Brighton.It would be too anticlimactic if no mysteries surrounded the Beast’s departure.One story, told by James Laver, has it that in his last days, Crowley’s doctorthreatened to cut off his heroin supply. Crowley told him that if he did, he,Crowley, would die, and that he would take him with him. Dr. William BrownThomson, Crowley’s physician, did indeed die twenty-four hours after Crowley’sdeath; the official report blamed his death on natural causes, and it is mostunlikely Dr. Thomson interfered with Crowley’s heroin use. Yet inevitably thetabloids made much of his demise; the Daily Express ran a headline “CrowleyDoctor Dies: Magician Put Curse On Him.”3 [index_split_019.html#filepos854954]Another more poignant mystery is where Crowley’s ashes ended up. Crowley hadasked that his ashes be preserved along with his seal ring in a casket andentrusted to the Grand Treasurer of the O.T.O., The urn containing Crowley’sashes was sent to Karl Germer in America. Germer informed curious correspondentsthat Crowley’s ashes had been buried at the foot of the largest pine tree on hisproperty in Hampton, New Jersey; being a Jerseyite, I was surprised to hearthis. But a later story emerged. In this version, discussing with his wife,Sascha, the question of what to do with Crowley’s ashes, Germer was surprisedwhen Sascha, never a thelemite, suddenly grabbed the urn and smashed it againsta tree. One version of the story has her saying, “There, this is now theAleister Crowley tree,” but in another the ashes were simply blown by the wind.This last version strikes me as most apt. There is some poetic justice in thefact that a man who was a wanderer of the waste in life should also drift hereand there in death. One almost wants to say “no rest for the wicked,” andcertainly not for the wickedest. No gravestone or memorial marks Crowley’spassing, and I am not sure if the Aleister Crowley tree—as Germer is said tohave called it—is still standing.4 [index_split_019.html#filepos855119]A year after Crowley’s death, a group of his friends gathered at an Indianrestaurant in North London to remember his passing. Appropriately, chiles werepiled on and strong spices applied. Crowley had asked as much, and we can feelthe cold hand of his wraith reaching out from New Jersey, urging his comrades onto greater helpings. But for the larger world, Crowley’s death meant that he wasno longer in the public eye or mind. Facing post–World War II austerity, Britonshad more to occupy themselves with than the dubious career of the Wickedest Manin the World, and with time his memory faded.In 1951 some of the old morbid fascination returned when Charles RichardCammell’s Aleister Crowley: The Man, the Mage, the Poet appeared, but it wasleft to the odious—at least to thelemic eyes—John Symonds to really bring backthe Beast. The Great Beast was published in the same year as Cammell’s morefriendly work. It has to be said, though, that considered simply as a book,Symonds’s work is more of a success. Whatever you may think of Crowley,Symonds’s is a more readable, more memorable work than Cammell’s apologeticmemoir, for all its virtues. The fact that Cammell’s appreciation of Crowley’spoetry at times rivals J.F.C. Fuller’s places his book, I think, beyond mostaverage readers; if people remembered Crowley at all, they did because of thetabloids, not his poetry. Symonds’s strategy was simple: give Crowley enoughrope, and he would hang himself. In practice this meant to present Crowley as hewanted to be seen, with his biographer keeping his tongue firmly in his cheek,only emitting a hint of disapproval every now and then. The effect is, on thewhole, hilarious, a neatly done send-up, even with knowing the omissions andinaccuracies that pepper the book. But although Symonds took argument withCrowley, the fact that the book was about Crowley at all was enough to make itverboten. Colin Wilson tells the story of a friend who, soon after Symonds’sbook was published, asked a local library if they intended to stock it. He wastold indignantly that nothing “would induce them to spend the rate-payers’ moneyon such vicious rubbish,” a sentiment with which some thelemites might agree.The library even declined to get the book through an interlibrary loan, such wasCrowley’s reputation.5 [index_split_019.html#filepos855328]Symonds wrote other books, including a biography of Madame Blavatsky, to whom heis somewhat more kind, and novels, but, as he admitted, he aimed to make hisname with Crowley, and he did. In 1958 The Great Beast was followed by TheMagick of Aleister Crowley, and from then until his death in 2006 Symondsbrought out new, expanded, and revised editions of his controversial but highlyentertaining life of the Beast. Whatever we may think of Symonds, he more thananyone else is responsible for keeping Crowley’s name alive.But he was not solely responsible. The odd sea change Crowley underwent,transforming him from a scurrilous knave into a spiritual liberator, began,oddly enough, in France. In 1960 a book appeared that almost singlehandedlytriggered what’s been called “the occult revival of the 1960s,” the history ofwhich I chart in Turn Off Your Mind. There had been a slow buildup of interestin the occult through the late 1940s and ’50s, with the rise of public interestin flying saucers and other “weird” concerns; Immanuel Velikovsky’s Worlds inCollision (1950), which linked biblical accounts of the flood to the Earth’sclose shave with a comet, and T. Lobsang Rampa’s doubtful account of his life asa Tibetan yogi, The Third Eye (1956), had both been big sellers. But it was theappearance of Le Matin Des Magiciens (1960) by Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergierthat really triggered the return of magic. The book is a heady, oftenmind-numbing jumble of strange, new, and unusual ideas that took the Paris ofJean-Paul Sartre and existentialism by storm. It rambled from alchemy to UFO toGurdjieff to ancient civilizations to mutants to occult Nazis to higherconsciousness and then some—rather like Charles Fort’s books of the 1920s and’30s, although much better written. It became a huge bestseller and when it wastranslated into English in 1963 as The Morning of the Magicians (The Dawn ofMagic in the UK), it was a bestseller, too. And amid its mysterious thicket of“all things occultly marvelous”—in the historian Theodore Roszak’s words—wasCrowley and the Golden Dawn. Never mind that what the authors had to say aboutCrowley, the Golden Dawn, and much else was often inaccurate. The book is fullof mistakes and unsupported assertions—such as that Gurdjieff was responsiblefor the Nazi use of the swastika. What was important was that they were talkingabout magic and the occult at all. They knew that the time had come for a changefrom the black-and-white world of political commitment, la nausée and beingengagé, to something much more colorful, dazzling, and exciting. Crowley hadspoken about the new age of the “crowned and conquering child.” With The Morningof the Magicians the newborn seemed to be waking up.In his own lifetime Crowley had been an influence on popular culture. SomersetMaugham, we’ve seen, had used him as a model for a black magician, and Maugham’snovel The Magician (1908) was turned into a film in 1926. Crowley has also beensuggested as the model for the cult leader in Edgar G. Ulmer’s occult decohorror film The Black Cat (1934), starring Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi; it’sunclear if Crowley ever saw it or knew he was being cast in the role of asadistic Satanist, but most likely he would have approved. Crowley, in fact,served as a model for more than one cinematic mage. In a talk I gave in Londonand in Trondheim, Norway, I looked at those films already mentioned as well as afew other classic black magic films from the 1950s and ’60s that featured amagician based on Crowley. Night of the Demon (1957), The Devil Rides Out(1968), and The Dunwich Horror (1970)—which is an early entry in the Crowley–H.P. Lovecraft connection mythos—all feature Crowleyan elements, and Crowley’sinfluence isn’t limited to B-movie shockers. As mentioned, the avant-gardefilmmaker Kenneth Anger was profoundly influenced by Crowley—his whole oeuvre,we can say, is thelemic through and through—as was the Chilean directorAlejandro Jodorowsky, whose The Holy Mountain (1973) often shared top billingwith Anger’s films at midnight movie offerings.6[index_split_019.html#filepos855489]Mention of The Devil Rides Out, based on Dennis Wheatley’s novel published in1934, reminds us that Crowley was also an influence on literature, or at leastfiction. We’ve already mentioned Maugham. A list of writers who used Crowley insome way would include, among others, M. R. James (his “Casting the Runes”inspired Jacques Tourneur’s Night of the Demon, mentioned above; the magicianKarswell is based on Crowley), Dion Fortune, Colin Wilson, Anthony Powell, JamesBlish, Robert Heinlein (whose Stranger in a Strange Land [1961] employs largehelpings of Crowley’s philosophy), and, perhaps most recently, Jake Arnott,whose The Devil’s Paintbrush (2009) focuses more on Crowley’s homosexuality thanhis magick. Crowley led such a supersized life that it would be surprising if hehadn’t been taken up by novelists, always on the lookout for strikingcharacters. There are more sightings of the Beast in the pages of fiction, pulpor better, but this should suffice.But the area of popular culture in which Crowley has had the most impact surelymust be music. It took some time, but by the mid-1960s, the occult revival hadreached the burgeoning “youth culture,” which was itself on its way to becominga serious rival to the mainstream, what became known as the “counterculture.”Popular music has always had some connection to the “dark side.” The myth of theearly-twentieth-century bluesman Robert Johnson selling his soul to the devil inreturn for success—a bad bargain, as Johnson didn’t see it—is paradigmatic, andby then the link between music and the devil was already longstanding. Thenineteenth-century violinist Niccolo Paganini, like Johnson, was supposed tohave sold his soul to the devil, as was also said of the eighteenth-centurycomposer Giuseppe Tartini, famous for his “Devil’s Trill” (1713). The violinitself is considered the “Devil’s instrument,” and Igor Stravinsky’s “TheSoldier’s Tale” (1918) relates the parable of a soldier who gives his violin tothe devil in exchange for worldly success. Hector Berlioz’s SymphonieFantastique (1830) is famous for its musical depiction of a witches’ Sabbath.Music has always had an element of danger associated with it because of itsability to subvert the conscious mind and reach directly into the unconscious;Plato, we know, famously banned most music, except for a few bland modes, fromhis utopian Republic. Thomas Mann’s cautionary novel Doctor Faustus (1947)blends the archetypal tale of the magician who sells his soul to the devil, withthe tragic life of a brilliant but unbalanced composer (based on the philosopherNietzsche). That old black magic, it’s true, has had many in its spell.7[index_split_019.html#filepos855854]Yet even the long history associating music and the devil can’t account for thestrange blend of magic and rock and roll that emerged in the “mystic ’60s,” norfor the threatening, revolutionary character this pairing briefly enjoyed. Whenthe ’60s occult revival met the growing counterculture something strangehappened. Each recognized that they had a common enemy in what was called “theestablishment.” This term stood for the values, institutions, sensibilities,tastes, political ideals, and morality of the previous generation, and thedistance between it and the burgeoning one became known as the “generationgap”—a phrase put to good marketing use when the Gap clothing retailer openedfor business in 1969. Fifties teenagers were also unsatisfied with thebuttoned-down, conventional life they were expected to inherit from theirparents, but they expressed their dissatisfaction by being “crazy mixed-up kids”or “rebels without a cause,” letting off steam through vandalism and surlyaggressiveness. Their rebellion had little focus, as can be seen in theearly-teenage-exploitation film The Wild One (1953). When Johnny, the leader ofa motorcycle gang, played by Marlon Brando, is asked what he is rebellingagainst, he answers, “Whaddaya got?” The same sense of aimless rejection fuelsJack Kerouac’s Beat classic, On the Road, published in 1957. When Dean Moriartytells Sal Paradise, “Whee. Sal, we gotta go and never stop going till we getthere,” Sal asks, “Where we going, man?” Dean replies, “I don’t know but wegotta go.”8 [index_split_019.html#filepos856152] Dean Moriarty is based on NealCassady, an early Beat and later one of Ken Kesey’s LSD-fueled Merry Pranksters.Cassady kept going until the night of February 3/4, 1968. He was found the nextmorning in a coma on some railway tracks in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, anddied the next day ostensibly from exposure, but he had also taken a hefty doseof barbiturates. He was just short of forty-two. Kerouac himself kept goinguntil 1969, when, increasingly disgusted with the hippie generation that hisbooks helped spawn—he hated the hippies and famously at a meeting betweenKerouac and Kesey’s Pranksters, Jack solemnly folded an American flag that theacid-heads had draped over his shoulders—he succumbed to cirrhosis of the liver,brought on by years of heavy drinking. He was forty-seven. The actual first Beatnovel, written by John Clellon Holmes and published in 1952, was entitled Go.This is not, it seems to me, vastly different from “Just do it,” or “Do whatthou wilt.”In the 1960s, this sense of having “to go” gained more focus, and theaimlessness of simply being on the road turned, in many cases, into a genuine“journey to the East”: a search for something more fulfilling than the Americandream of a house, a car, and 2.5 kids. The influx of magical and mystical ideasthat came with the ’60s occult revival offered what seemed like a positivealternative to the ’50s negative rebelliousness. It gave a burgeoning “youthculture” a sense of direction. At the same time, “the establishment” was thestronghold of the rationalist, materialist philosophy that denied that magic,mysticism, and spirituality were anything but superstitious nonsense. Theofficial view of reality said that matter was the only real thing. Spirit simplydid not exist, and magic was an illusion, belief in it a sign of madness, orchildishness: adults didn’t believe in such things. For such a philosophy,material gain was the only value: a bigger TV, a bigger car, a bigger bankbalance. The new generation rejected this and the worldview that went with it.So the scientific, modern ideals of the “atomic age” 1950s were jettisoned infavor of the ancient belief in magic, myth, and the mystical. Adult realism gaveway to a childish belief in magic. In 1965 the Lovin’ Spoonful had a Top Ten hitwith their song “Do You Believe in Magic?” Many did. This cultural atavism wasthreatening to the adult establishment and for a time the political and themagical currents in the 1960s joined forces. One clear if somewhat ludicrousexample of this occurred during the massive anti–Vietnam War march on Washingtonin October 1967, when the Crowleyan filmmaker Kenneth Anger attempted toexorcize the Pentagon while the Beat poet Allen Ginsberg tried to levitate it.9[index_split_019.html#filepos856338]By then Crowley was without a doubt back. Twenty years earlier he had died inobscurity in somewhat squalid circumstances, but by 1967 Crowley was hangingout—posthumously, of course—with some of the most famous people in the world,and was more popular than he had ever been. If any one sign marked that thecounterculture had given its imprimatur to the occult revival, it had to be thefact that the Beatles had included Crowley on the cover of their album Sgt.Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, released in the fateful summer of 1967.Designed by the artist Peter Blake, the cover has Crowley’s by-now-familiarshaven head and bulging eyes cropping up between the Indian guru Sri YukteswarGiri and the actress Mae West: aptly, as mysticism and sex formed the heart ofCrowley’s life. Other figures sharing space with Crowley—Aldous Huxley, C. G.Jung, Sri Mahavatar Babaji, and Sri Paramahansa Yogananda—show that by the timethe Beatles came to know about the Beast, magic, mysticism, and altered stateshad become the hottest things in town. A few years earlier such stuff would havebeen laughed at by the mods, but by the summer of love practically everyone onthe Swinging London A-list had their heads into the occult. That the Beatleswere fully behind Crowley’s program is clear from a remark John Lennon made inan interview for Playboy magazine, some years later and shortly before hisdeath. “The whole Beatle idea was to do what you want . . . do what thou whilst,as long as it doesn’t hurt somebody,” Lennon told the journalist David Sheff,misquoting Crowley.10 [index_split_019.html#filepos856495] Earlier, Ringo Starrhad told Hit Parade magazine that the cover featured “people we like andadmire,” a sentiment Paul McCartney echoed when he informed Musician magazinethat the cover sported “photos of all our heroes.”11[index_split_019.html#filepos856928] The Beatles, however, tended more towardEastern than Western mysticism, as evidenced by their rocky relationship withthe Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.By the autumn of 1967 rank-and-file British hipsters learned of Crowley when theunderground newspaper International Times—cofounded by Barry Miles, a friend ofthe Beatles’—ran a full-page article on him, presenting the Great Beast as aproto-hippie whose sex-and-drug-filled life seemed right up the counterculture’salley.12 [index_split_019.html#filepos857142] Richard Cavendish’s The Black Artshad been published that year, and was part of Mick Jagger’s favorite bedsidereading. It featured sections on Crowley and the Golden Dawn, and in The LongTrip: A Prehistory of Psychedelia (1997), the writer Paul Devereux reminiscesabout how in the late ’60s he saw a “white-suited Mick Jagger” leave WatkinsBookshop off the Charing Cross Road carrying “a stack of occult books.”13[index_split_019.html#filepos857317] Back in the Great Beast’s salad days,Watkins Bookshop was home to members of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.Well and truly, Crowley was back in town.The Rolling Stones, the second most famous people in the world, got deep intoCrowley through the filmmaker Kenneth Anger, who arrived in London in early1968.14 [index_split_019.html#filepos857527] The Stones were already friendswith the alchemist Stanislas Klossowski de Rola, author of Alchemy: The SecretArt (1974)—he was friends with the Beatles and Pink Floyd’s Syd Barrett, too—andJohn Michell, whose The View over Atlantis (1969) would inaugurate the nextdecade’s fascination with ley lines and “earth magic.” (Michell’s The FlyingSaucer Vision [1967] was already a countercultural “must-read.”) The Stones werefriends with the art dealer Robert Fraser, whose gallery on Duke Street,Grosvenor Square, sold stills from Anger’s films. Fraser had worked with PeterBlake and art-directed the Sgt. Pepper’s cover. The Stones’s own shot at apsychedelic LP, Their Satanic Majesties Request (1967), released a few monthsafter Sgt. Pepper’s, speaks for itself, as does what soon became their signaturetune, “Sympathy for the Devil,” from Beggar’s Banquet (1968). Anger had made hisname with such avant-garde thelemic films as Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome(1954), mentioned earlier, and Scorpio Rising (1963), which in many waysinitiates the rock and roll/transgressive sex/leather-jacketed/occult antinomianmélange that now characterizes much of what in Turn Off Your Mind I christened“roccult and roll.” Anger was keen for Jagger to star in his magnum opus,Lucifer Rising (1966–1980), a cinematic paean to Crowley’s coming new age, butJagger demurred. He did, however, provide a synthesizer soundtrack to Anger’sdisturbing Invocation of my Demon Brother (1969). As we’ll see, Anger alsoapproached Jimmy Page, the guitarist for Led Zeppelin and a Crowley devotee, forhelp in raising Lucifer, but as frequently happened with Anger, the two had afalling-out. The film eventually appeared, starring pop chanteuse MarianneFaithfull, with a soundtrack by ex–Charles Manson “Family” member BobbyBeausoleil, who composed it while serving a life sentence in Tracy State Prisonin California for the murder of Gary Hinman in 1969. Anger and Beausoleil hadbeen friends back in Haight-Ashbury, and there is a lingering legend that aftera tiff, Beausoleil stole the reels for Lucifer Rising and gave them to his guru,Charlie. Beausoleil is French and means “beautiful sun,” and Crowley we know wasa sun worshipper. . . .Keith Richards and his girlfriend Anita Pallenberg came more intimately underAnger’s spell. Richards told Rolling Stone that witchcraft, magic, and Satanismwere things everyone should explore, and he called himself Kenneth Anger’s“right-hand man” although left-hand would perhaps have been more appropriate.The Stones’ sympathy for the devil, however, did not last long and after theirdisastrous concert in Altamont, Jagger decidedly backed away.But by then, the hippie musical Hair had told everyone that it was the dawningof the age of Aquarius—a prophecy that in his lifetime Crowley took someargument with—and the Fifth Dimension had a No. 1 hit with “Age of Aquarius /Let the Sunshine In,” a nod, perhaps, to a particular potent batch of LSDpopular at the time. The folk rocker Donovan sang about the lost continent ofAtlantis, whose resurfacing many had anticipated sometime in 1969, and eveninnocuous fare like the folk singer Buffy Sainte-Marie expressed antinomiansentiments when she announced that she was dedicated to “Satan and Jehovah—mygod is Abraxas, the god of evil and good.”15[index_split_019.html#filepos857689] (Abraxas, a Gnostic deity, made hiscountercultural debut in Hermann Hesse’s novel Demian [1919], a ’60s bestseller,and in 1970 Santana released an album named after him.) Magic was in the air,the Zeitgeist was suffused with the mystical, and at least one major figure fromthe fields of flower power based much of his career on that of Crowley.Timothy Leary, the Harvard psychology professor turned drug guru, made no bonesabout how much his attempt to turn on the world with lysergic aciddiethylamide—better known as LSD—was inspired by Crowley’s own adventures; in apost-’60s interview for the PBS program Late Night America, Leary made clearthat he had long been an admirer of Crowley’s and that he was “carrying on muchof the work” that Crowley had started and that the ’60s themselves were anexpression of “Do what thou wilt,” something with which, we’ve seen, John Lennonagreed.16 [index_split_019.html#filepos857816] Even Leary’s tag as “the mostdangerous man in America,” given him by then President Richard Nixon, was asynchronistic echo of Crowley’s tabloid profile as “the Wickedest Man in theWorld.” Confessions of a Hope Fiend (1973), one of Leary’s severalautobiographies—like Crowley, Leary enjoyed talking about himself—is a mash-upof Crowley’s Confessions and Diary of a Drug Fiend. And at one point, Leary wasconvinced that he and an acid buddy, Brian Barritt, were somehow reenacting—orreincarnating—Crowley and Neuburg’s adventures with Choronzon in North Africa, atrip recounted in Barritt’s memoir The Road of Excess (1998); again, that weirdlink to a very disturbing episode in Crowley’s career. After discovering thestrange parallels between Crowley and himself, Leary remarked about the “eeriesynchronicities” between his life and Crowley’s, “unfolding with such precisionas to make us wonder if one can escape the programmed imprinting with which weare born . . .”17 [index_split_019.html#filepos857975]One recipient of Leary’s psychedelic wisdom was John Lennon, who in 1966 found acopy of The Psychedelic Experience (1964)—by Leary, Ralph Metzner, and RichardAlpert—in London’s Indica Bookshop, an emporium of countercultural literaturerun by Barry Miles and linked to Robert Fraser’s gallery. Leary’s advice that,“whenever in doubt, turn off your mind, relax and float downstream,” struckhome, and Lennon incorporated the line in his song “Tomorrow Never Knows,” fromthe album Revolver (1966), generally regarded as the Beatles’ first psychedelictrack. Lennon spent the next few years turning off his mind by ingesting verylarge doses of LSD. Another link between the psychedelic milieu, the occult, androck were the Doors. Their name came from Aldous Huxley’s influential book TheDoors of Perception (1954), an essay about Huxley’s experiment with mescaline.Huxley, a more judicious advocate of psychedelic exploration than Leary, got thetitle himself from William Blake’s The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, and in 1970the Doors released Doors 13, their first “greatest hits” compilation; the backcover featured a photo of the group sitting around a bust of Crowley. The bandrecorded one more album before their leader, Jim Morrison, died in mysteriouscircumstance in Paris in 1971. That Morrison was on the antinomian bandwagon isclear from his remark that “I am interested in anything about revolt, disorder,chaos, especially activity that seems to have no meaning,” written for apublicity release for the Doors’ record company Elektra in 1967. Morrison’slyrics also suggest a familiarity with Crowleyan themes: “Can you picture whatwill be, so limitless and free?” (“The End”) and “We want the world and we wantit now” (“When the Music’s Over”). These yearnings for the Abyss and for theimmediate gratification of the child need not have come to Morrison directlyfrom Crowley, but they were certainly in the atmosphere of the time.One thelemic fatality was the R&B artist Graham Bond, a seminal figure onLondon’s early ’60s blues scene, who performed with superstars like Jack Bruceand Ginger Baker of Cream. Bond, a keyboardist, became a Crowleyite, made blackmagic gestures on stage, and met with a tragic end. Under the influence ofCrowley’s magick—and also heroin—Bond believed he was one of Crowley’sillegitimate sons, joining the ranks of many who boasted of this dubiouscelebrity. He named his bands Holy Magick and Initiation and walked throughSwinging London in his magical robes—much as Crowley did invisibly on RegentStreet. His record company, Mercury—aptly named, as in his Greek form, Hermes,he is the god of magic—allowed him to use their offices for rituals. Throughdrugs and his obsession with Crowley, Bond’s grip on reality loosened, and hewould often be seen wandering the streets in a dazed condition, unwashed anddisheveled. In 1974, after years of decline, he threw himself under a train atLondon’s Finsbury Park Underground station.By the early 1970s, with its millenarian expectations behind it, the occult boomin popular culture had settled into a stable subgenre—where it remainstoday—with bands like Black Sabbath and Kiss doing their demonic best to bring adevilish tone to the strains of heavy metal. In February 1970, on Friday 13,Black Sabbath released their first album, Black Sabbath, the title of a 1963horror film by Mario Bava starring an aged Boris Karloff. The eponymous songfrom the album was inspired by the work of Dennis Wheatley and incorporates the“Devil’s tritone.” Another track, “N.I.B.,” is supposedly written from Lucifer’spoint of view. Critics were not impressed; Lester Bangs, writing for RollingStone, complained about the “doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley,” but fansloved it, and Crowley’s influence continued to inform the band’s singer, OzzyOsbourne; in 1980 Osbourne released a solo single, “Mr. Crowley,” the lyrics ofwhich—“Mr. Crowley, what went down in your head / Mr. Crowley, did you talk withthe dead?”—are emblematic of much of the rock informed by Crowley.By 1974 the new, darker strain of “occult rock” was given the blessing of anearlier generation, when in Crawdaddy magazine Beat magus William Burroughs Jr.wrote that “rock and roll taps the sources of magical energy, and this can bedangerous.”18 [index_split_019.html#filepos858179] (And, of course, Burroughsknew that this was its appeal.) By then it was common knowledge that Jimmy Page,the guitarist for Led Zeppelin, was a fan of Crowley’s work, his appreciation ofit going so far as to purchase Boleskine, Crowley’s house in Scotland, in 1971.He owned it until 1991, and the house and its grounds feature in the group’sconcert film The Song Remains the Same (1976); in a fantasy sequence Page climbsa nearby mountain in search of the tarot figure of the Hermit.Page has earned a bad reputation in thelemic folds for snatching up a great dealof Crowleyana and keeping it in his private collection, unavailable to devotees,rather as if some fervent Christian had his hands on important holy relics. Buthis sincerity can’t be denied; I mentioned earlier the $1,700 he spent on aCrowley manuscript at Gilbert’s Bookshop in Hollywood. Page met Kenneth Anger atan auction of Crowley memorabilia at Sotheby’s. Both vied for a rare copy of TheScented Garden but the waiflike guitar hero easily outbid the often impecuniouscineaste. Anger was not angry that Page had outbid him; by this time the Stoneshad given Anger a cold shoulder and he was on the lookout for another rockgiant. Anger approached Page and asked if he would provide the soundtrack toLucifer Rising; impressed with Anger’s occult expertise, Page agreed.Yet Lucifer still didn’t rise. In 1972 Page had bought the eccentric neo-GothicTower House near London’s Holland Park. Designed by William Burgess in the late1800s, it is thought to be haunted. Among other oddities it has an astrologyhall, with a painting of the zodiac adorning the ceiling. The house was beingsold by the actor Richard Harris—who spoke of its poltergeists—and Page hadoutbid another Crowley fan, David Bowie, for the place. Page let Anger use thebasement to get Lucifer to rise, but Anger didn’t feel at home there andcomplained that he couldn’t make a cup of tea without setting off an alarm.Oddly, Anger had rented Boleskine just before Page bought it: the two seemed tobe following each other. By 1976 they had an irreparable falling-out.Anger was miffed that after three years, Page had produced only twenty-eightminutes of soundtrack; he also felt that Page was not adhering properly to thethelemic program and was sinking too deeply into heroin. As was his commonresponse to frustration, Anger performed a ritual and turned Page into a toad.Anger had earlier performed the same magick on Bobby Beausoleil, but apparentlyhis transgression was forgotten and, as mentioned, it was Beausoleil’s music oneheard when Lucifer finally rose at the film’s premiere in 1980 at New York’sWhitney Museum.But Page did not need Anger to pursue his magick, and Led Zeppelin albums arethought to be informed with a great deal of magickal symbolism. Althoughofficially titleless, Led Zeppelin IV is perhaps their most obvious occultrelease, sporting weird, runic-like symbols for each band member instead of atitle, and supposedly invested with much magick, such as having “Do what thouwilt” inscribed in the disc’s inner groove. Robert Plant’s symbol of a leafwithin a circle is supposed to be based on the symbolism of the ancient lostcivilization of Mu, believed to have existed in the Pacific, and to have sunkmillennia ago, much as Atlantis. Mu was the subject of a series of books in the1920s and ’30s by James Churchward. Plant’s other magical interests includedJ.R.R. Tolkien’s innocuous hobbits. Page’s own symbol, which has come to beknown as “ZoSo,” although he denies it is a word or means anything at all, hasan appropriately sigil-like character, and reminds me of some of Austin OsmanSpare’s work. “Stairway to Heaven,” their most famous track, is also supposed tobe rich in thelemic symbolism; in the 1980s, paranoia gripped a certain sectionof the American Christian community because it believed that subliminal satanicmessages, hidden on the album by a technique called “backward masking” andrevealed by playing the track backward, urged listeners to embrace Satan andaccept the rule of 666. The group, of course, denied these claims. In the early1970s, Page’s magical interests also included owning an occult bookshop, theEquinox, named after Crowley’s magazine. In 1976, Page told Sounds magazine that“Aleister Crowley is the great misunderstood genius of the twentieth century,”an assessment with which Crowley would no doubt agree.The other big rock name of the ’70s fascinated with Crowley and the occult was,as mentioned, David Bowie. Bowie’s is perhaps the most introspective andreflective pop adaptation of occult themes, and his lyricism is welcome afterthe crude assertion of much magical heavy metal. In his plaintive song“Quicksand,” from the album Hunky Dory (1971), Bowie tells us that he is “closerto the Golden Dawn / immersed in Crowley’s uniform of imagery.” Like Crowley,Bowie’s occult contemplation is often wedded to disturbing kitsch-Nietzscheanideas about a super-race: in the same song, notions of the “death of man,” the“superman,” and “the logic of Homo Sapiens” sit uncomfortably close to Nazihenchman Heinrich Himmler’s “sacred realm of dream reality.” (“Oh You PrettyThings” on the same album informs us that we “gotta make way for the HomoSuperior.”) Mention of Himmler tells us much about Bowie’s occult reading. Hispiquant dallying with fascism and Nazi chic in the mid-1970s was born of anacquaintance with The Morning of the Magicians and also with TrevorRavenscroft’s highly readable but largely fictional account of Hitler’s occultobsessions, The Spear of Destiny (1973). In “Station to Station,” from the 1976album of the same name, Bowie sings of “one magical movement from Kether toMalkuth,” the first and last sephiroth on the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, orIpsissimus and Zealator in the Golden Dawn system of initiation, and also throwsin a reference to Crowley’s “white stains.” As I relate in Turn Off Your Mind,while recording the album in Los Angeles, Bowie went through a series of bizarreexperiences that convinced him he was under a magical attack.19[index_split_019.html#filepos858495] In New York Rocker: My Life in the BlankGeneration (2002), written under my stage name Gary Valentine, I also tell thestory of being asked to leave Bowie’s Manhattan loft in 1980, because of adisagreement over the work of Colin Wilson during a late-night discussion aboutthe occult.20 [index_split_019.html#filepos858658]By the ’80s, “roccult and roll” had established itself as a permanent strain inrock, more or less covered under the sobriquet “goth,” i.e., “gothic,” from agenre of literature devoted to the dark and supernatural; a formative gothicnovel, The Mysteries of Udolpho (1794), by Ann Radcliffe, features a mysteriouscastle, ghosts, a brooding villain, dark romance, and other items that soonbecame stock-in-trade of horror fiction and films. Yet not all Crowleyitesfollowed this trend. In 1980 the soft-rock singer Daryl Hall (formerly of Hall &Oates) released a thelemic solo album, Sacred Songs, one track of which,“Without Tears,” is supposedly based on Crowley’s Magick Without Tears. In aninterview with the journalist Timothy White, Hall remarked that he “becamefascinated with Aleister Crowley . . . because his personality was theequivalent of mine—a person brought up in a conventional religious family whodid everything he could to outrage the people around him . . .”21[index_split_019.html#filepos858820] But most occult rockers were less clean-cutthan Hall. More typical was the British heavy metal band Iron Maiden, whosealbum The Number of the Beast (1982) speaks volumes. Though not directly Crowleyinfluenced, it certainly shared with him a fascination with the Book ofRevelations, which did not sit well with Christian fundamentalists. Later trackssuch as “Moonchild,” on their 1988 release Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, aremore directly Crowley related, and singer and lyricist Bruce Dickinson wouldlater write the screenplay for the film The Chemical Wedding (2008)—released inthe United States as Crowley—about a reincarnated Beast getting up to his oldtricks.But the more ponderous rock appropriations of Crowley and magick drew fire fromsome of Crowley’s more serious devotees. In 1983, David Tibet, of the Crowleyangroup Current 93, wrote an article, “The Return of the Beast,” for theunderground music magazine Flexipop; appropriately it appeared in the magazine’sissue No. 666. Tibet, a serious student of Crowley’s work, complained about howCrowley was “popular with the uninspired image seekers because he generated muchpowerful imagery.” Magick, Tibet lamented, provided symbols that are “ready-madeand waiting for those with little respect for Crowley and their audiences.”22[index_split_019.html#filepos859279] Groups lambasted by Tibet were BlackSabbath, Hawkwind, Graham Bond, Led Zeppelin, King Crimson, Toyah, and Blood andRoses, among others. Tibet was not alone in his assessment; the rock journalistSandy Robertson, for one, agreed. “Groups like Venom, Witchfynde, Iron Maidenand so on,” Robertson wrote, “ramble on incoherently about the occult in theirlyrics, while the record covers are littered with inverted crucifixes androtting zombies.” Goth rockers fare no better: they are “pseudo-‘Gothic’”wannabes, “nasally crooning about ‘doing what thou wilt’.” Both types forRobertson—and one assumes Tibet—“have no real knowledge of Crowley’s ideas andare only interested in sensationalism and selling vinyl.”23[index_split_019.html#filepos859464]Echt musical Crowleyans then, one assumes, must come from Tibet’s own camp.Tibet, a member of the O.T.O. (at least of Kenneth Grant’s controversialTyphonian branch), emerged from the experimental art-music group Psychic TV,started in England in the early ’80s by the performance artist GenesisP-Orridge. An associated project was Thee Temple Ov Psychick Youth, a kind ofcult-cum-fan club and loosely knit magical organization, dedicated to exploringthe transgressive sides of magical activity. After many transmutations, it stillexists today; along with Crowley, some of its influences include the 1960santinomian Process Church of the Final Judgment, William Burroughs Jr., BrionGysin, and other practitioners of what has come to be called “occulture,” aportmanteau indicating the amorphous mélange of occultism and counterculturethat characterizes much twenty-first-century magic.24[index_split_019.html#filepos859680]Along with “guiltless sexuality” and “chaos magic,” other transgressiveactivities of Thee Temple Ov Psychick Youth include “deconstructing” “normal”communication, hence the eccentric spelling, a tactic taken up in recent yearsby many rappers and followed by Crowley himself with “magick.” Orridge’s ownmagical and antinomian influences include Anton LaVey, founder in 1966 of theChurch of Satan, and Charles Manson, as well as Crowley; in a strangely apt actof reversal, the two ’60s antinomian icons to enjoy a renewed celebrity withlate-twentieth-century roccultists are a self-professed Satanist and a convictedkiller: so much for love and peace. Orridge himself came out of the “industrial”music group Throbbing Gristle, which was known for incorporating hardpornography and images of Nazi concentration camps into their performances.Orridge in many ways seems to have aimed at fulfilling Crowley’s desire torevolt “every comparatively sane human being on earth”—Crowley’s explanation forhis stint as a German propagandist during World War I. Orridge’s outspokenadvocacy of deviant culture led, however, to some unfortunate results; as he wasfollowing in Crowley’s footsteps, this is not surprising. In 1992 a performanceart video made for Orridge by the filmmaker Derek Jarman came to the attentionof the UK’s Obscene Publication Squad. Christian activists claimed the filmdepicted satanic child abuse, sodomy, and forced abortions, among othertransgressions. On the strength of these accusations, Orridge’s home was raidedby the police. Nothing incriminating was found and the allegations weresubsequently dropped, but Orridge, who was in Nepal at the time, decided not toreturn to the UK and went into self-imposed exile in the United States. In the1990s, Orridge embarked on an experiment in “body modification” with his secondwife, aiming at producing a “pandrogyny,” or single nonmale, nonfemale sex.Among other expedients this included breast implants and the use ofnon–gender-specific pronouns.Crowley was taken up by other “experimental” groups, such as Coil, associatedwith Psychic TV, who blended homosexual motifs with Crowley’s magick and thekind of musique concrète inaugurated by the Futurist artist and “noisician”Luigi Russolo in the early twentieth century. Others of a similar bent were BoydRice of the group Non. Rice, a priest of LaVey’s Church of Satan and, likeCrowley, a Social Darwinist, is also a fan of Charles Manson and a collector ofBarbie dolls; like Buffy Sainte-Marie, Rice, another producer of “industrial”music, is also a devotee of the gnostic god Abraxas.25[index_split_019.html#filepos859951] But by the ’90s less obscure roccultistswere making waves. The adolescent need to be more shocking than your parents ledsome of ’90s youth to embrace disturbing antiheroes such as Manson. LikeCrowley, Manson is a kind of gray eminence lurking in the shadows of the 1960sand is the dark antitype of the flower children: what better role model for ’90syouth rebelling against their hippie parents?Nine Inch Nails recorded their 1994 album, The Downward Spiral, in a studiobuilt at 10500 Cielo Drive in Los Angeles, scene of the vicious murders ofSharon Tate and friends by the Manson family. Trent Reznor, the group’s leader,christened the studio Le Pig; infamously, one of the Manson killers had written“PIG” in Sharon Tate’s blood in the front hall. The most obvious Mansonite,though, has to be Marilyn Manson, whose name comes from a mash-up betweenMarilyn Monroe and Manson. Manson’s performances are replete with theby-now-standard assortment of transgressive ingredients: kitsch fascism, satanicimagery, thelemic antinomianism, deviant sexuality, sadomasochism, death, andother dark stuff popular with angst-ridden teens. Like Boyd Rice and GenesisP-Orridge, Manson is a fan of Anton LaVey; in Satan Speaks! (1998), a collectionof LaVey’s writings, Manson calls him “the most righteous man I ever knew.”Magick and other assorted occult items inform much of Manson’s act. Crowley isreported to be one of his favorite authors and Crowleyan motifs inform Manson’salbums, such as Antichrist Superstar (1996). Manson’s penchant for adopting astage name based on a convicted killer is shared by some of his band members.Madonna Wayne Gacy, stage name of one of Manson’s keyboardists, is an amalgam ofthe pop singer Madonna—who herself proclaimed an interest in Kabbalah in the’90s—and the homosexual serial killer John Wayne Gacy, executed in 1994 for themurder of at least thirty-three victims.One would think that by the 2000s, the Crowley–pop music franchise would haverun its course, but in recent years the Beast has been rediscovered by a newgeneration eager to earn their antinomian stars. The late 1990s saw a kind ofrenewed occult revival, or, more accurately, a Gnostic revival. The Gnosticswere an early antinomian Christian sect who, as mentioned earlier, believed thatthe God of the Bible—Jehovah—was a kind of “lieutenant god,” who usurped thetrue God’s place and created the “false” world in which we live. The neo-Gnostictrend included a reappraisal of the work of the pulp science-fiction writerPhilip K. Dick, whose many novels and stories deal with the themes of falserealities, altered states, and the fragility of personal identity. Starting withBlade Runner (1982)—based on his story “Do Androids Dream of ElectricSheep?”—many of Dick’s works were made into films. Total Recall (1990) dealswith the notion that our identity is unstable, and that the person we think weare may not be who we really are, and that even the idea of really being oneperson rather than another is iffy. More recently The Adjustment Bureau (2011)centers on the idea of powerful people “behind the scenes,” who secretly controlour lives, making the necessary “adjustments” to them without our knowing, inorder to keep to the “plan.”26 [index_split_019.html#filepos860083] In bothfilms the world we live in is not the “real” world. By the late ’90s thisGnostic theme was turning up in several films, ironically, as the film medium isitself an “unreal” world. The Cube (1997), The Truman Show (1998), and Dark City(1998) all deal with the same idea: their protagonists find themselves trappedin a “false” reality, a kind of prison from which they cannot escape. The mostsuccessful and influential work of this genre was The Matrix (1999), whichspawned a franchise including two sequels, comic books, video games, and muchelse. Again, the central theme is of being trapped in a false reality, an unrealworld, in this case a computer simulation being fed into our consciousness byintelligent machines that feed off humans. That the liberators of humanity inthe film wore black leather and dark glasses and packed guns made the Gnosticquest for the “true world” even more thrilling.Much of the inspiration for The Matrix and films like it came from the growingfascination—some might say obsession—with the Internet, “virtual reality,” andthe “cyberworld” that has by now become as ubiquitous and indispensable astelevision, an earlier “false” reality. Today we all live with a sense ofreality not being quite what it seems. Rightly or wrongly we have—at least inthe West—grown suspicious of every authority; to borrow a phrase from thephilosopher Paul Ricouer, we live under the “hermeneutics of suspicion,” and theonce firm footing for our beliefs is now little more than thin ice. This senseof ontological disorientation has reached contemporary pop. Innocuous acts likethe Jonas Brothers and celebrities like Peaches Geldof (daughter of Bob Geldofof the punk-era Boomtown Rats) sport thelemic emblems: a recent photographrevealed that Peaches had an O.T.O. tattoo and she sang the group’s praises onTwitter; while Kevin Jonas irritated some fundamentalists by wearing a CrowleyT-shirt.27 [index_split_019.html#filepos860302] Crowley’s image has turned up inthe fashion world, too; actress and model Taylor Momsen was caught by apaparazzo with the Beast all over her.28 [index_split_019.html#filepos860590]This does not mean that these celebrities are Satanists, black magicians, or arereally “into the occult,” although Geldof has earlier spoken of her interest inScientology. (Her remark that Crowley’s books are “super interesting” maysuggest the depth she has reached in her esoteric exploration.) What it doesmean is that we live in a world flooded with images, whose meanings most of usare ignorant of; as David Tibet said, Crowley provided striking images forpeople with no imagination. But there are somewhat more serious signs that theBeast is still on the prowl.In an interview about his video “Run This Town” (2009), the rapper Jay-Z wears ahoodie emblazoned with “Do What Thou Wilt.” If this isn’t bad enough, the videoitself is said to be rife with thelemic, occult, and other esoteric symbolism,mostly of a Masonic, Illuminati bent; that the singer Rihanna holds a torchaloft in the video is supposed to be representative of Lucifer, the fallen angeland “light-bringer.”29 [index_split_019.html#filepos860779] Along with otherbiblical baddies, Lucifer is a Gnostic hero, rejecting the authoritarian rule ofJehovah. The video takes place in a postapocalyptic landscape; the atmosphere isthreatening, suggesting that order is giving way to chaos, that the old world iscrumbling and a new, more violent one is emerging—perhaps Crowley’s era of“force and fire”?—that the elite will dominate. Jay-Z is also making a mark—ofthe Beast?—in the fashion world, with an esoteric fashion line, Rocawear, thatsports a medley of Masonic symbols: pentagrams, pyramids, “All-Seeing Eyes,”which also turn up in his videos and in live performances. The “devil’s horns”sign, made by clenching the thumb and middle fingers and extended the fore andlittle fingers, has become very popular, and figures like Rihanna and Eminemhave more or less branded it. Jay-Z’s video “On to the Next One” (2010) evencontains a brief flash of the Templar deity Baphomet, the androgynousgoat-headed idol now associated with Satan and one of Crowley’spseudonyms—although Eliphas Levi, the nineteenth-century occultist who designedthe image, receives no royalties or credit.The association of Crowleyan motifs with rap may seem far-fetched, but Crowleyhimself was into bling, spending freely—usually other people’s money—on rings,tie pins, cuff links, and other solid signifiers of power. Does this mean thatJay-Z is really an agent of the Illuminati, a late-eighteenth-century breakawayMasonic group upon whom more conspiracy theories have been hung than I care torelate? More likely he is, as Mick Jagger was in the late 1960s, an astutetactician, cannily addressing a felt appetite for some elite knowledge andvocabulary, available only to those “in the know,” and rediscovering that occultimagery has a strange appeal to rebellious youth, eager to shock anyone theycan. Another performer, the R&B singer Ciara, has also added to the occult brew;in her video for “Keep On Lookin’” (2013) she sports a jacket emblazoned with“XIV Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn” on the back and boots to match; othersingers, like Kanye West and Ke$ha, apparently share her hermetic interests.30[index_split_019.html#filepos860958] Rather than providing evidence of a rapoccult conspiracy, more likely these celebs feel the need to keep up with oneanother.Another recent antinomian pop manifestation comes from Lady Gaga. Her video“Judas” (2011) is a good example of Gnostic pop. In it, Jesus and his disciplesare a motorcycle gang. Lady Gaga as Mary Magdalene dumps Jesus for Judas andrides off with him on his motorcycle; I suspect Kenneth Anger would be wellpleased with seeing his occult-biker imagery making the scene once again. ForGnostics, Judas was a hero, and he is for Lady Gaga, too. In the video Jesus isshown healing the sick, helping the poor, and performing other Christian acts,while Judas drinks and paws women. Some suggest this is a symbol for Crowley’scoming age of Horus, which rejects Christianity and encourages hedonisticthrills. The fact that Lady Gaga’s eyes are made up to look like “eyes of Horus”has convinced some that, like Jay-Z, she is in some way an agent of forces thatare out to undermine morality and decency and inaugurate a new age of lust anddepravity—at least from their eyes.If peace-loving hippies, violence-loving punks, death-loving goths, devil-lovingheavy metallers, noise-loving performance artists, and bling-loving rappers canall be into Crowley, what does that tell us? That Crowley’s philosophy isecumenical enough to appeal to practically everyone? Or that at bottom theappeal is very simple: it is the appeal of the forbidden, the shocking, thetransgressive? My guess is number 2.—AS YOU MIGHT SUSPECT, most of the concern about the dangers of the new popoccultism comes from Christian fundamentalists. But the odd thing is that, whileresearching this material on the Internet, I was struck by the similaritybetween the “satanic” Web sites and the fundamentalist ones. Both used strikingimagery, both exaggerated the power and importance of “the occult,” and bothpandered to a taste for sensationalism, a kind of “spiritual pornography,” aimedat titillating base emotions: fear, greed, egoism, power. Often I had to checkto see which one I was looking at. Both cater to the belief that there issomething dangerous about the occult, Crowley, esotericism, and the Gnosticbelief in a “false world.” I would agree with this, but not for the reasonsfundamentalists give. I don’t think listening to Jay-Z or Lady Gaga is going tolure anyone into Satan’s clutches. The danger, I think, is the very one thatDavid Tibet pointed out decades ago: that Crowley and others like him providepowerful imagery that can be easily taken up and used by people who lack theimagination to create their own imagery or to understand what such imagery meansand can do. Earlier I mentioned the philosopher Jean Gebser, who speaks of a“magical structure of consciousness.” This ancient level of the psyche is stillactive in us; anyone who has ever felt “carried away” at a rock concert or otherlarge group experience feels it. William Burroughs wasn’t joking when he saidthat rock taps into the sources of magical energy, and that this can bedangerous. The danger is not so much in the energy itself—it is, we can say,neutral—as in our ability to understand it. It is no surprise that magic in someway—Crowley’s variety or otherwise—still appeals to “youth culture” and findsits way into its music. Magic and the music industry make use of much of thesame materials—imagery, special effects (light shows), illusion, trance—and bothreach down below the conscious mind to the deeper, older, more visceral levelsof ourselves. Both also cater to that adolescent appetite to be someone“special,” to stand out, to be noticed, to belong to the elite and to have aneffect on the people around you. Crowley often claimed that he could makehimself invisible, yet he did everything he could to draw attention to himself.If he were around today, he would no doubt turn up on chat shows, be tweetingregularly, and make guest appearances on YouTube.That Crowley has been appropriated by today’s celebrities is a pop version ofthe fact that his portrait hangs in London’s National Portrait Gallery. In onesense this neutralizes him and his philosophy: if the Jonas Brothers are intoCrowley, how dangerous can he be? But in another sense such neutralizing has itsown pitfalls. It suggests that we have become inured to the kind of characterCrowley was, and accustomed to his lifestyle, his “excess in all directions.”Does this mean that Crowley was right, and that the new age he prophesized hasarrived? Not really. What it means, I think, is that Crowley was a kind ofpre-echo of our own moral and spiritual vacuum. For better or worse, we do findourselves in an antinomian world, beyond good and evil, in which practicallyanything goes and we are urged to give into our impulses and “just do it.” Ifnothing else, giving in to impulse is good for business. But we all live in aworld with constant distractions, constant allurements to have, do, or be“more”—we have so lost touch with life that we have to “capture” it on ourcellphones, as if it were a wild creature on the loose, and display our trophieson social networks. We are very far from Pascal’s suggestion that we sit quietlyin a room.But if Crowley was right, and this is the era of the “crowned and conqueringchild,” I can only hope that he grows up soon."},{"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Many people helped make this book possible.

Although Blavatsky’s Masters were> Hindus, there is a good argument that the notion of “Secret Chiefs” has its> source in the “unknown superiors” of the Strict Observance Freemasonry of Karl> Gottlieb von Hund, which began in France in the 1740s. “Strict Observance” got> its name because the rite required a vow of absolute obedience to the> mysterious “unknown superiors” who were its leaders. Hund claimed that in 1743> he was initiated into the rite by a masked man known only as “the Knight of> the Red Feather.” Madame Blavatsky’s great-grandfather—whose occult library> started her on her esoteric career—belonged to a Russian Strict Observance> lodge, and his loyalty to his “unknown superiors” may have inspired> Blavatsky’s own obedience to her Hidden Masters. Another possible source for> the Secret Chiefs is the mysterious Rabbi Samuel Jacob Chayyim Falk, an> enigmatic character at the hub of esoteric life in London in the eighteenth> century, and who counted Swedenborg and Cagliostro as his students. In 1889,> in the notices page of a literary magazine, Westcott himself suggested that> “the Order of mystics which gave Eliphas Levi [the great nineteenth-century> French occultist] his occult knowledge, and of which Johann Falk was at one> time the Lecturer on the Kabbalah in London, is still at work in England” and> he names it “the Hermetic students of the G.D.” (For much of the Golden Dawn’s> early history, the meaning of the initials G. D., like that of the A...A...,> remained secret.) It is possible, though doubtful, that Falk himself was the> “hidden superior” that initiated Karl Gottlieb von Hund in Paris.
