This story deserves a book of its own,and Tobias Churton demonstrates here that the Beast is indeed in the details.”RICHARD KACZYNSKI, AUTHOR OF PERDURABO: THE LIFE OF ALEISTER CROWLEY“Churton has sifted through a mass of material—from long-neglected documents tothe latest researches of contemporary Crowley scholars—to put together thiscomprehensive and intriguing study of the years the Beast spent in America. Hebrings fresh eyes to old controversies, such as the true nature of Crowley’spolitical activities during the First World War, and presents a work that anyoneinterested in the history of Crowley and his circle will read with enthusiasm.”KEITH RICHMOND, CO-OWNER OF WEISER ANTIQUARIAN BOOKS AND AUTHOR OF PROGRADIORAND THE BEAST“This beautifully produced and richly documented history tracks and clarifiesCrowley’s myriad experiences in America. Tobias Churton admirably sorts out factfrom fantasy and shines an illuminating light on a misunderstood facet ofCrowley’s career.”MITCH HOROWITZ, PEN AWARD–WINNING AUTHOR OF OCCULT AMERICA“Way beyond the standard Crowley hagiographies, Churton’s books always put theGreat Beast in cultural context. This fascinating must-read is no exception;it’s an invaluable, well-researched, and highly entertaining insight into thegreat magician’s life, thoughts, and scandals during his American adventures.”CARL ABRAHAMSSON, AUTHOR OF OCCULTURE: THE UNSEEN FORCES THAT DRIVE CULTUREFORWARD AND REASONANCES AND EDITOR OF THE FENRIS WOLF“Magician Tobias Churton has successfully cast a spell, transforming his750-page comprehensive scholarly tome into a gripping and obsessive page turner,leaving one wishing for more. Replete with new and exciting details andinterpretations of Crowley’s time in the New World—and of the multiple denizensof his exciting and unique social circles—the book includes previouslyunpublished manuscripts, letters, and photographs. Churton furnishes the readerwith a sensitive and intimate portrait that brings Crowley to life—as if we areinvited to a convivial conversation or private dinner with the Magus himself.Truly an outstanding, enjoyable, and invaluable book!”JAMES WASSERMAN, AUTHOR OF TEMPLAR HERESY: A STORY OF GNOSTIC ILLUMINATION“Crowley had a great hunger for almost everything he ever thought of or saw. Hewas economical with the truth, with his own money, and with his loyalties,but—and it is a big but—the scope and scale of America thrilled him. Thevitality of the big cities, the newness and esoteric searching of the West Coastmade him delirious with a big, greedy joy. He loved the States for nearly thirtyyears, as it gave him a dedicated group of very clever people, like JackParsons, who practiced what he preached. Tobias Churton has uncovered freshmaterial on Crowley in biographically fresh territory and has once again writtena very fine book.”GERALDINE BESKIN AND BALI BESKIN, OWNERS OF THE ATLANTIS BOOKSHOP, LONDON"},{"pageContent":"CONTENTS 1.

One of those shared features is thesheer weight of information available concerning their respective careers andthe high degree of controversy about aspects of each of their activities.When I began writing my own biography of Crowley (Aleister Crowley: TheBiography) in 2008, I was very conscious of the late Martin Gilbert’s bulky,eight-volume Churchill biography—all of which, I’m happy to say, I had read longbefore with relish. As in Churchill’s biographical case, a single volume wasreally inadequate to the purpose, given the growing extent of serious Crowleystudies, and I ran into trouble over length with the original publishers. Thisled to agonizing delays in publication, only resolved at last by the involvementof a new publisher. If my subsequent study, Aleister Crowley: The Beast inBerlin (2014), has not proved that the days of single-volume biographies ofCrowley’s life are over, then this book certainly should. Feeling the weight ofthis tome, I cling for encouragement to the fact that the book that turned me onto Crowley in the first place, back in 1978, was Crowley’s “autohagiography,”known generally as the Confessions. Nine hundred sixty pages in length, and allcontained in a single handsome volume, it still only took Crowley’s lifestory—as he chose to tell it—up to 1922, with twenty-five years left unaccountedfor. If, as some would believe, Crowley’s life is not worth taking seriously,then it would not be worth writing about at all. Such might, in my view, only befairly said of some of his detractors.This, the first properly researched account of Aleister Crowley’s extensive andquite fascinating adventures in America, has been rendered even more challengingan exercise by the appearance in 2008 of Professor Richard B. Spence’s SecretAgent 666: Aleister Crowley, British Intelligence, and the Occult. Spence’shypothesis that Crowley was an intelligence agent, or at least asset, for muchof his mature life, has truly thrown the cat among the pigeons of Crowleystudies and forced open-minded scholars to look much more closely at manylacunae regarding Crowley’s activities and motives. I have had to deal with themany questions raised by Spence’s hypothesis head on, and with thoroughness, asthe picture changes very quickly as the kaleidoscope of extant evidence isviewed from different angles. There is mystery.Furthermore, there has long existed the extremely vexed question of whetherAleister Crowley was a traitor to his country of birth during the period 1914 to1917. This has proved itself a supremely difficult issue to wrestle with due tothe fact that intelligence services that might have inherited key documentationapparently do not consider the questions involved worth investigating in thepublic arena, for such is, understandably, not those organizations’ purpose.Reluctance inherent to these systems is partly reinforced by the nature ofCrowley’s popular reputation, particularly in Great Britain, and partly becausethe question hinges on the aforesaid theory regarding Crowley’s allegedintelligence role, a difficult matter to be sure. Documents declassified andreleased in the United States tell a nuanced, if still complex, story to thatwhich has become a more or less official spectrum of views in Great Britain.Added to Spence’s speculative intelligence scenarios, recent discoveriesregarding Crowley’s activities in Mexico in 1900 to 1901 raise similar questionsto those pertinent to his World War I record. These I have also had to examinecarefully and have reached my own conclusions on the issue, given the evidencecurrently available. All of these issues are critical to assessing AleisterCrowley’s personal integrity, something he insisted on with great vigor in hisConfessions, and an attribute vital in a spiritual teacher, which Crowleyclaimed to be. It would be hard to find in the annals of human history a figurecombining spiritual teaching with so many other large-scale commitments, andyet, to whom personally, all these activities amounted to a predominantconception of service to the future of humanity. Crowley undoubtedly presentsposterity with a great riddle, and this book does more than attempt to solve it.In my research into these and many other questions concerning Crowley’sexciting, multifaceted career (alive and dead, present and absent) in Americathroughout the twentieth century, I am, above all, indebted to the marvelousassistance afforded me by the international head of the Ordo Templi Orientis,William Breeze, who has time and again demonstrated unfailing willingness tobring to my attention rare documentation, his exacting knowledge base, andexperienced insight into all matters Crowleyan, without which this book wouldhave been barely a shadow of what it is; indeed, without his help the projectwould not have been worth the effort expended on its composition. William Breezehas been kind and generous enough even to acquaint me with information he hasgathered for his yet unpublished, unexpurgated edition of Crowley’s completeautobiography, as well as his edited transcripts of Crowley’s unpublisheddiaries, and much else, while throughout I have enjoyed complete freedom ofinterpretation and exposition. It was William Breeze who pointed me in thedirection of the John Quinn Papers deposited in the professional care of the NewYork Public Library, Manuscripts and Archives Division. Thanks to the provisionsof that great institution I have been able to study authentic material that hasled to a far greater, scholarly appreciation of the sometimes difficult andalways intriguing relationship that developed between a most remarkable lawyerand generous, enlightened collector, John Quinn, and Aleister Crowley. The JohnQuinn Papers also shed much-needed light on the complex relations that existedbetween Quinn and John Butler Yeats, the latter’s son, William Butler Yeats, andthe no less remarkable Jeanne Robert Foster (1879–1970), whose almost incrediblelife would stand as a monument to tenacity, profound dedication, and appliedcreative intelligence and artistic imagination, without any mention of the factof her being, for a season (1915–1916), Crowley’s “Scarlet Woman,” as he choseto see her. Exploring Jeanne Robert Foster’s life with the aid of RichardLondraville’s moving biography of Jeanne, Dear Yeats, Dear Pound, Dear Ford, andthe Foster-Murphy papers (also held in the care of the New York Public Library’sManuscripts and Archives Division) has been one of the brighter highlights ofresearching this book; I learned so much and, like all who had the good fortuneto come to know her, found Jeanne Robert Foster an inspiring figure. It isarguable that Aleister Crowley never quite got over their broken relationship,while Jeanne herself went on to greater heights.A proper assessment of Crowley’s disinformation strategy worked through thepages of German New York–based propaganda magazine The Fatherland from 1915 to1916 has been expedited thanks to the professional website provisions of theDigital Library, Villanova University, Falvey Memorial Library, who havedigitized the once obscure issues of the German Propaganda Kabinett’s principalpublic outlet in America during World War I. Likewise, the Library of Congress’swebsite devoted to “Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers,” madepossible by the National Endowment for the Humanities, has proved an invaluableresource for tracing the day-to-day news stories that dominated American popularthinking during the period under study.I must express particular gratitude for the kindness shown to me by Crowleybiographer Richard Kaczynski, who has shared with me, his fellow laborer in thevineyard, revealing and important researches into Crowley’s correspondence withnoted scientists William Sturgis Bigelow (1850–1926) and Professor Elihu Thomson(1853–1937), made available to him through the good graces and kindconsideration of Charles Greifenstein and Earle Spamer of the AmericanPhilosophical Society. I am also thankful for Richard Kaczynski’s sharing of hiswork on Crowley’s relationship with Albert W. Ryerson and the Freemasons ofDetroit in 1918–1921.While writing this book, I was delighted to be informed by Messrs. Breeze andKaczynski of historical researcher Colin Campbell’s discovery of the originalcottage where Crowley experienced his “psychedelic” summer of 1916 near Bristol,New Hampshire, by Newfound Lake (known locally as Lake Pasquaney). That hascorrected a longstanding misapprehension regarding the site of Crowley’sexperience of the “ball of fire” and the place where Crowley wrote his detailedassessment of Christianity, The Gospel according to St. Bernard Shaw. I am mostgrateful for Colin’s kind correspondence with me on the subject, as well as hisprovision of photographs of the site as it is today, the property of theO’Connor family. I should also like to express my thanks to James Wasserman, whokindly provided me with photographs by Gregory von Seewald of Esopus Island,where James Wasserman followed Crowley in making this remarkable island in theHudson the site of a holiday campsite.My gratitude to Frank van Lamoen, assistant curator at the Stedelijk Museum ofModern Art, Amsterdam, knows no bounds. It was he who, stimulated by this study,decided to form the best chronology ever undertaken of the life of artist LeonEngers Kennedy. It is included as an appendix to this book as accurateinformation on Engers’s life is extremely hard to come by and is of greatinterest to enthusiasts of Crowley’s life, not least of whom is RichardKaczynski, who has given talks on the life of an artist who was a friend ofCrowley for many years, even providing Crowley with digs in New York during avery hard time endured during late winter to summer 1917, when Crowley was oftenill and at a very low ebb both in health and in fortune.Enormous appreciation and myriad thanks are properly due to the staff at InnerTraditions International: to Jon Graham, whose faith in this project ensured itsexecution; to Mindy Branstetter, who has been stalwart and always considerate inher dealings with me over the vastness of the editing process; to Jeanie Levitanfor all her help and kindly guidance on finding the right format for thematerial; and to all at ITI for their artistry, care, and professionalism.I also wish to acknowledge the longstanding kindness and encouragement I havereceived from Geraldine and Bali at the Atlantis Bookshop, Bloomsbury, London: averitable anchorage for the British fleet of Crowley’s aficionados andfollowers. Long may it thrive!It has been a magnificent privilege to make this intimate tour of the UnitedStates that existed from 1900 to the millennium, a period of bewildering,sometimes dazzling change, and some progress, and to show, in this centenaryyear of Britain and the United States’ first coming together as allies andbrothers in arms against tyranny, that the spiritual magician and pioneer ofscientific illuminism made such an enlightening contribution, even ifunacknowledged, to the progress of Britain and America—a gift of insight stillyet to unfold the fullness of its potential glory, in a life lived by others ina world to come.Finally, I should like to dedicate this book to my beloved wife, Joanna, anddaughter, Merovée, who have had to suffer the exhausting process of this book’scomposition close-to. What I owe, I cannot hope to repay, which makes me adenizen of that debtor’s prison, into whose cells I should recommend anyone tobe liberated.TOBIAS CHURTON ENGLAND, APRIL 2017"},{"pageContent":"PART ONE> THE ADVENTURE"},{"pageContent":"ONEimage [images/9781620556313_099.jpg]A Special Relationshipimage [images/9781620556313_003.jpg]The fire of love no waters shall devour;The faith of friendship stands the shocks of time;Seal with your voice the triumph of this hour,Your glory to our glory and our power,Alliance of one tongue, one faith, one clime!Seal and clasp hands; and let the sea proclaimFriendship of righteous fame,And lordship of two worlds that time can never tame . . .And join our worlds in one amazing netOf empire and dominion, till aghastThe lying Russian cloak his traitor headMore close, since Spain has bledTo wake in us the love that lay a century dead . . .Our children’s children shall unsheathe the swordAgainst the envy of some tyrant power:The leader of your people and our lordShall join to wrest from slavery abhorredSome other race, a fair storm-ruined flower!O fair republic, lover and sweet friend,Your loyal hand extend,Let freedom, peace and faith grow stronger to the end!ALEISTER CROWLEY, FROMAN APPEAL TO THE AMERICAN REPUBLICThe year is 1899. Stirring stanzas fly from Aleister Crowley’s “Appeal to theAmerican Republic.” In a twelve-page visionary pamphlet, the poet hailsAmerica’s recent triumph in the Spanish-American War and unfurls his desire forAnglo-American alliance: a new dawn for the world will depend upon it.Wrapped in red papers, emblazoned with a color-embossed crossing of Union Jackwith Old Glory, Crowley’s outspoken optimism appeared, at the time, decidedlypremature. It was, however, prophetic. Britain and America have indeed“unsheathed the sword” in allied opposition to “some tyrant power,” and theyhave done it in the name of peace, prosperity, and freedom since 1917, eighteenyears after Crowley’s initial, fervent appeal.Victory over Spain changed America. Thanks to the war, the United Statesacquired Spain’s remaining possessions beyond Africa—the Philippines (for $20million), Guam, Puerto Rico, and a protectorate over Cuba. Quite suddenly, theUnited States appeared to the world an empire. And Crowley envisioned a union ofimperial might to embrace the world and nourish the babe of global freedom inthe light of liberty. What revolutionary poet William Blake had dreamed of inhis prophecy “America” in 1793, Crowley saw reentering the stage of the world asreality a little more than a century later.Crowley was not entirely alone in his enthusiasm. In England on May 13, 1898,shortly after Spain declared war on the United States over what she saw asAmerican interference in Cuba, British Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlaininformed his Birmingham constituents that Britain could no longer stand inisolation, “envied by all and suspected by all.” Britain would have to makepacts. Critical of Russia for breaking peace pledges, Chamberlain favored pactswith Germany and with the United States. Denounced in St. Petersburg, derided inGermany, Chamberlain’s idea nonetheless found an appreciative audience amongleading U.S. journalists. Appreciation still registered seven months later. OnDecember 10, 1898, a day before the Treaty of Paris officially ended theSpanish-American War, another speech by Chamberlain to voters in the EnglishMidlands received the New York Tribune’s qualified blessing.Probably nobody has been more astonished than Mr. Chamberlain himself by thecriticism which his speech, brimming over with good feeling for America, hasexcited in America; he is, in reality, the last man in England who wants aformal alliance with the United States, for, as Secretary of State for theColonies he has Canada to deal with, and his own reputation to maintain as thegreatest English Imperialist. He believes heartily in the closest possiblefellowship between England and America and takes the statesmanlike view thatboth nations can admit Germany into the same sphere of good feeling andco-operation in commercial and maritime policies.This was the idea which he clearly expressed at Leicester, and Americans have noreason to hold him accountable for the inadvertent use of the word “alliance,”which was immediately translated into “understanding based on good feeling.” Mr.Chamberlain is a sincere and useful friend of America: probably there is noother leading Englishman who is equally outspoken in praising America or is soutterly indifferent to a foreign alliance in any quarter, so long as England cancount upon American good will. His diplomacy can probably be summed up in wordslike these: “With Americans with us in heart, it matters not who may be with usor against us.”There was of course one Englishman who was working hard to become a “leadingEnglishman” and who would shortly appear even more outspoken in his desire foran alliance, and that was twenty-four-year-old poet, mountaineer, and magicalenthusiast Aleister Crowley: like Chamberlain, a supporter, albeit a criticalone, of Lord Salisbury’s Tory government.What perhaps is most striking about the coincidence of interests of ColonialSecretary Chamberlain and the firebrand poet recently down from university isthat Edward Alexander Crowley—“Aleister” was his pen name—had entered Cambridgewith every intention of assuming a career in Britain’s diplomatic service. Hadall passed as intended, Crowley would probably have been knocking onChamberlain’s door in search of preferment around the time the Tribune articleappeared.1898: A DIPLOMAT MANQUÉCrowley enjoyed many advantages. Not the least of them was a distinguisheduncle: civil engineer, inventor, and patron of science Jonathan Sparrow Crowley(1826–1888). On the death of his first wife, Jonathan Crowley married hischildren’s governess, Anne Heginbottam, or Heginbotham (1840–1921), described inhis nephew’s autobiography as “a lady of a distinguished Saxon family, who couldtrace her pedigree to the time of Edward the Confessor. Tall, thin,distinguished, and highly educated, she made an admirable chatelaine. Herpersonality appealed strongly to me, and she took that place in my affectionswhich I could not give to my mother.*1 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft1] She becamea prominent member of the Primrose League, and it was through her influence withLord Salisbury and Lord Ritchie that I obtained my nomination for the DiplomaticService.”1 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt1]Taking its name from former Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli’s favorite flower,the Primrose League was founded in 1883 by Lord Randolph Churchill and Sir HenryDrummond-Wolff to spread Conservative principles and provide the party withauxiliary support. Jonathan Crowley’s first cousin Florence Mary Crowley(1847–1927) was also a member. True to his family’s established tradition,Crowley was a lifelong “High Tory” patriot. As such, he was nominated for thediplomatic service by Robert Gascoyne Cecil, Marquess of Salisbury, Grandmasterof the Primrose League, three times prime minister (1885–1902); and bySalisbury’s loyal cabinet member, Charles Thomson Ritchie (later 1st BaronRitchie), former secretary of the Admiralty.Crowley’s replacement mother figure, Aunt Annie, actively supported Ritchie’ssuccessful 1895 campaign for election as member of Parliament for Croydon, nearLondon, home to Crowley’s Ales and two feisty women Conservatives, Anne andFlorence Mary, familiar names to Croydon’s Conservative leadership, conscious ofthe power of a prominent, established family of Croydon brewers.That year 1895 also saw Anne Crowley’s talented, potentially high-flying nephewenter Trinity College, Cambridge—alma mater to Lord Salisbury’s three halfbrothers and ideal portal to a life of political and philosophical intrigue.That Lord Salisbury was on the lookout for young men of ability can hardly bedoubted, and it is the prompting of this thought, together with the evidentialpresence of a series of espionage connections in Crowley’s later life, thatencouraged Richard B. Spence, professor of history at the University of Idaho,to flesh out his theory that Crowley’s links to corridors of power led torecruitment at Cambridge into the secret service.2 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt2]RECRUITED AT CAMBRIDGE?Unfortunately for us, British evidence mounted in support of the theory is,where not ambiguous, mostly circumstantial. MI6 and MI5 archives are excludedfrom public access; responses to inquiries conform to standing policies:complete openness and candor are hardly to be expected, and data releases meetinternal not external requirements. Further, neither MI5 nor MI6 existed at thetime Crowley was at Cambridge, nor during Crowley’s early career.During the late Victorian and Edwardian periods up to 1909, Britain’s secretservices were performed by numerous organizations, often ignorant of oneanother’s activities, and sometimes even existence, with little coordinationamong them. In the 1880s, for example, two intelligence bodies gathered evidencefor Fenian (Irish republican) terror plots, both agencies getting in eachother’s way, with one operating practically outside the law. Much was undertakenby word of mouth, without record. Military and Naval intelligence activitieswere distinct and frequently competitive. Home intelligence tended to come underthe auspices of Scotland Yard and the “Special Branch” (originally establishedin the 1880s to counter Irish republican subversion), while foreign intelligencewas usually gathered by embassy and consulate staff, operating through“friendly” contacts, agents, and assets, in independent loops, and in Imperialpossessions by senior colonial policemen, not infrequently imported to Britainfor special services involving delicate operations where native judicial scruplemight obstruct effectiveness.Nevertheless, U.S. historian Spence’s requests for British documents establishedthat so-called MI5 (home intelligence) and MI6 (foreign intelligence) had, or atvarious points in time had, files on Aleister Crowley. MI6 simply denied access,while MI5 denied existence of any such files, informing Spence, tellinglyperhaps, that the absence of files may have been because “despite his[Crowley’s] bizarre antics the view may very well have been taken that Crowleydid not represent a threat to security.” When in the course of research Spencediscovered reference to a genuine MI5 file, he was informed, “Sadly, it wasdestroyed (we think) in the 1950s when large numbers of records which seemed atthat point to have out-lived their usefulness were destroyed.”3[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt3]Files listed in the British Foreign Office Correspondence Index, numberingthree, including two related to Crowley’s 1914 to 1918 activities, were missing.In short, the case for Crowley’s intelligence work based on direct officialBritish corroboration alone may passably be described as weak or inconclusive.However, the case has other significant evidential, not only circumstantial,supports not to be fairly dismissed.CROWLEY AND THE CARLISTSWe know that young Crowley involved himself with “Carlist” and “Legitimist”politics, including armed subterfuges in 1899. In fact, a tangled web joinsCrowley’s Carlist activities to the immediate consequences of Spain’s defeat bythe United States, and it was to be that web of intrigue that stimulatedCrowley’s first voyage to America in July 1900.On July 27, 1899, the New York Times published a surprising story that theformer governor of Cuba, Don Valeriano Weyler y Nicolau (1838–1930), wassuspected of plotting a coup d’état in Spain with the Carlists.The Carlists were a traditionalist faction that backed the claim of Don Carlosde Bourbon, the Duke of Madrid, to the Spanish throne. The story was especiallysurprising because before he assumed Cuba’s governorship in 1896, Weyler, withcharacteristic thoroughness, had actively suppressed several Carlist revolts inSpain. Indeed it was the transference of Weyler’s uncompromising zeal to Cubathat in part precipitated the Spanish-American War in the first place. Pushingfor U.S. intervention in the Cuban revolt, William Randolph Hearst’s “yellowpress” dubbed Weyler “the Butcher.” Before resigning as Cuba’s governor in 1897,Weyler had introduced “re-concentration,” a phrase soon to be modified into thenow infamous “concentration camp” for separating insurgents from civiliansupport by incarcerating civilians in resettlements.Back in Spain, horrified by capitulation to America, Weyler sought nationalredemption. A headline in New York’s Sun newspaper (July 27, 1899) declared:WEYLER HINTS AT REVOLUTIONIt Might Accomplish, He Says, the Regeneration of Spain.Madrid July 26—In the course of the debate in the [Spanish] Senate today on thebill fixing the strength of the army, General Weyler made a remarkable speech,which is being interpreted as being an exhortation to the populace to combinewith the army against the government. “Revolution might accomplish theregeneration of Spain. At any rate, revolution sometimes clears the politicalatmosphere. I will do all I can to uphold military discipline, but the situationis very grave and a revolt will probably break out.”This was by no means the first time Americans had been informed of moves tosupplant the Spanish parliament (Cortes) with a “legitimate” monarch; that is, amonarch first in line by birth and blessed by “divine right.” While the Spanishgovernment watched Weyler closely, the Chicago Tribune on August 28, 1898,headlined the SCHEMES OF THE CARLISTS and featured an interview with LordAshburnham, Don Carlos’s British representative and supporter of Legitimistpolitics throughout Europe. “My own idea,” Ashburnham informed the journalist,“is that there will not be a real war, but perhaps a little fighting here andthere. . . . Don Carlos is the rightful heir to the throne. He believes himselfcalled by the wishes, if not of an actual majority, at any rate of the best andmost honorable portions of the Spanish people.” If successful, Don Carlos wouldnot only reign, he would also govern; ministers of state would report to him,not to the Cortes; decisions of state would rest in the monarch under God. Sucha polity was music to the ears of the Roman Catholic Church.In May 1898, in a speech to the Primrose League that was widely reported in theStates and that angered many in Madrid, Lord Salisbury described Spain as a“moribund nation” and recommended that its government adopt a realisticacceptance of the United States’ role in the conflict; Salisbury believed thatthe United States’ growth was in Britain’s long-term interest. His position asregards a Spanish revolution was typically cautious. Informed of LordAshburnham’s Legitimist activism, Salisbury did not, as far as we know, directlyinterfere with the Catholic peer’s elaborate plans to send weapons and mercenarysupport to Don Carlos in Spain. However, with Spain and the United States on thebrink of war, Salisbury did receive a confidential note from Britain’sambassador in Madrid, Sir Henry Drummond-Wolff, concerning “very hostilecurrents which may overwhelm the dynasty and perhaps the monarchicalinstitutions, in the event of any grave reverse.”4 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt4]An Austrian queen regent represented the “dynasty” while the crown prince—of acadet branch of the Bourbons—was too young to ascend the throne. Pretender DonCarlos was the senior Bourbon and hence “legitimate” claimant.A possibility existed that should a Carlist coup fail, a victorious republicanfaction might abolish monarchy altogether: a possible threat to monarchiesacross Europe. Judging from a letter of April 28, 1899, sent by Paul vonHatzfeldt (1831–1901), German ambassador to London, to Freidrich Holstein(1837–1909), éminence grise of the German Foreign Office, after von Hatzfeldthad met Lord Salisbury in person, Salisbury’s concerns about a Spanishrevolution were influenced by the thought that if revolution did lead to themonarchy’s overthrow in favor of a Spanish republic then a weak Portugal wasvulnerable to combined French-Spanish republicanism. There were otherimplications.In the unlikely event of pretender “Carlos VII” achieving his aims, Don Carlos’sclaim to be “Charles XI,” legitimate Bourbon king of France, could, if pressed,substantially upset the continental status quo. Legitimists, after all, believedQueen Victoria and her Hanoverian predecessors were not Great Britain’slegitimate rulers, on account of the British Parliament having blocked alegitimate House of Stuart from succession to the throne for religio-politicalreasons back in 1701. In 1899, British Legitimists not only supported Don Carlosbut had a Stuart pretender in line for the British throne as well. Supporters ofthe Stuarts were commonly called “Jacobites,” after the Latin Jacobus, or“James,” referring to James Francis Edward Stuart (1688–1766), “legitimate”pretender to the British throne. Aleister Crowley was a lifelong Jacobitesympathizer, though his views would mellow with maturity.The British government was aware of British Legitimist support for Don Carlos.Von Hatzfeldt informed Holstein in Berlin that he had the previous day receiveda visit from Sir Henry Drummond-Wolff. Britain’s ambassador to Spain conveyedhis belief to the German ambassador that the syndicate, which had advanced DonCarlos £60,000, did not consist of business speculators accustomed to gamblingon winners but rather “fanatical legitimists like Lord Ashburnham, who is stilldreaming of a Stuart restoration, although there are no more Stuarts, and whoevery year places wreaths at the statue of Charles I [“martyred” by OliverCromwell in 1649].”5 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt5] The ambassador had hissources. Von Hatzfeldt agreed with the British ambassador, if only because DonCarlos could achieve little with the sum advanced.*2[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft2]To the end of his life, Aleister Crowley regarded himself as a High Tory with ananarchic spin, a believer in aristocracy and spiritual tradition. Whether heinherited the Jacobite strand of old Tory tradition from his activist Aunt Annieis unknown, but somewhere along the track Crowley, by the age of twenty-three,had acquired enthusiasm for Legitimist beliefs, if for no other reason than thatthey were romantic and squarely against the tendency of the times, whose moodpromised democracy, socialism, evangelicalism, more materialism—and ultimately,he believed, social and economic disaster.Crowley remained close to Aunt Annie. It was Aunt Annie’s late husband, UncleJonathan, who had saved Crowley from the brutality of a Plymouth Brethren schoolafter his beloved father’s death in 1887. Crowley even moved Annie into hishome, Boleskine House, by Loch Ness, after his marriage in 1903. His feelingsfor the legitimate House of Stuart were doubtless encouraged by Scottish cousinGregor Grant and from reading Rob Roy and kindred historical romances set in theheyday of Jacobite rebellions. Crowley felt the Stuarts’ cause had been lost tothe cause of Whig (anti-Tory) political expediency. England’s greater landowningaristocrats generally favored a controlled monarchy with no direct access totheir pockets; the burgher class, in general, followed suit. Queen Victoria,doyenne of the Whigs—now known as “Liberals”—was, of course, the politicallyexpedient Hanoverian married to a German.Crowley’s links to Legitimism were several. Louis Charles RichardDuncombe-Jewell (1866–1947) was, like Crowley, the son of Plymouth BrethrenChristian sectarians, which put him in a small, exclusive world. Duncombe-Jewellemerged from it as an army lieutenant and journalist. A friend of Crowley’ssince Duncombe-Jewell’s parents moved to Streatham, south London—where Crowleylived on and off from 1890 before going up to Cambridge in 1895—Duncombe-Jewellwas, at the time of the Spanish-American War and impending Carlist insurgency,Times correspondent in Spain. Pursuing his correspondent’s career with theMorning Post during the Boer War, and subsequently for the Daily Mail (in 1902),Duncombe-Jewell combined features writing with devotion to uniting the “fiveCeltic nations,” quixotically proposing Cornish independence. Crowley neededlittle encouragement to be seduced by the supposed magic of an ancient,imaginary “Celtic Church,” an alleged hidden spiritual church, or quintessence,of Britain’s soul. Unlike either mainstream or sectarian Christianity, theCeltic Church was not noticeably concerned with sin. This “virtual Church,” orconceptual body, attracted members of like romantic and spiritual disposition.Most significantly, Duncombe-Jewell belonged to the Thames Valley LegitimistClub, a radical coterie close to Bertram, 5th Earl of Ashburnham, KnightCommander in the Order of Malta’s Society of the Order of the White Rose,reformed in 1886 for Legitimist activities.On December 14, 1883, Lord Ashburnham had granted part of his Welsh estate inPembrey, Carmarthenshire, to the secretary of state for the War Department withright to use part of the manor for three months a year for seventeen years as afiring range for HM forces, at an annual rent of £20. Ashburnham now used thisland as a training ground for a tiny, secret organization to support the Spanishpretender.What took time to dawn on new recruit Crowley was that Legitimism was in fact aservant of political intentions nourished within the Roman Catholic Church,which, like young Crowley, detested universal suffrage and materialism and hopedto replace such aspirations with a return to Catholic authority. Young Crowley,on the other hand, sought his “return” through science, individual freedom,poetry, and spiritual magic. The Catholic Church naturally feared anarchy (asdid most conservatives, spiritual and otherwise), but Crowley felt somethingvital in the anarchic challenge; this would make for persistent paradoxicalconflict in Crowley’s complex psyche and opinions. For Catholic Legitimists,“legitimacy” meant spiritual and, therefore, worldly authority: the essentialright to rule. In his Confessions, Crowley describes his Legitimist training,and its shortcomings.Burns [the Scottish poet] and my cousin Gregor had made me a romantic Jacobite.I regarded the Houses of Hanover and Coburg [the British royal family] as Germanusurpers; and I wished to place “Mary III and IV” on the throne. I was a bigotedlegitimist. I actually joined a conspiracy on behalf of Don Carlos, obtained acommission to work a machine gun, took pains to make myself a first-class rifleshot and studied drill, tactics, and strategy. However, when the time came forthe invasion of Spain, Don Carlos got cold feet. The conspiracy was disclosed;and Lord Ashburnham’s yacht, which was running the arms, fell into the hands ofthe Spanish navy. [my italics]6 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt6]Crowley’s recent training on a machine gun is probably behind a jocularreference in an unpublished letter from Crowley to his Cambridge undergraduatefriend Gerald Kelly (1879–1982) written around November 1899 when Crowley hadjust moved in to his new estate at Boleskine, near Foyers, Inverness. Crowleyasked Kelly to gather copies of his unpublished poetry collection Green Alps andother works deposited with risqué publisher, Leonard Smithers.If you do this, the Gods will reward you, for I never will, as Queen Elizabethsaid. If you don’t, I shall apply a Maxim Gun to your anus and pic.*3[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft3] By the way, was I such a bloody fool of a prophetabout this war?†4 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft4] Be good and take your grade.

Yoursfraternally, P.¶7 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft7]7 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt7]Before Ashburnham’s arms run hit the skids, Crowley had already met his secondlink to Legitimism, Samuel Liddell Mathers (1854–1918), a man up to his neck inLegitimist conspiracy. From a Paris base at 87 Rue Mozart, Auteuil, Mathers ranthe secret Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, as well as a web of pro-Legitimistcontacts throughout the Western world.image [images/9781620556313_004.jpg]Fig. 1.1. Allan Bennett (1872–1923)Famously initiated into the Golden Dawn magical order in November 1898 asPerdurabo, Crowley received not only training in gnostic magic and Masonic-styleneo-Rosicrucianism but also a framework of spiritual attainment that, for betteror worse, gave the rest of his life its essential structure and much of itsmeaning. What perhaps is curious is that in Crowley’s account, his introductionto Mathers followed an allegedly chance encounter with Londoner Julian LevettBaker (1873–1958). An analytical chemist working close to the brewing industry,Baker had been initiated into the Golden Dawn on June 16, 1894, taking as hismotto, Causa scientiae (“for the cause of knowledge”). A few months later,George Cecil Jones was initiated. He and Baker had become friends at the City ofLondon School. Baker and Jones also shared an interest in chemistry’s origins inalchemy, though it was Jones who was most immersed in the medieval tradition.*8[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft8] It seems likely that it was fellow chemist AllanBennett who first recommended Baker to the GD (Bennett had been initiated inFebruary 1894.) Bennett and Jones would become close friends of Crowley afterCrowley and Jones first met in October 1898. A surviving envelope of picturesquehotel stationery, once containing a letter to Gerald Kelly at his parents’ houseat Camberwell Rectory, London, pinpoints the occasion of Crowley’s meeting withBaker. It was sent by Crowley—mountaineering at the time—from the Hôtel MontRose, Zermatt, Switzerland, and postmarked July 25, 1898.8[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt8]From the time scale, it looks as though Crowley’s interest in politicalLegitimism coincided with commitment to spiritual and magical initiation. If itwas Duncombe-Jewell who was chiefly responsible for Crowley’s association withthe Society of the Order of the White Rose, why had Duncombe-Jewell notmentioned his Legitimist colleague Mathers to Crowley in this context before?Crowley’s autobiography is mute on the question, but then again, Crowley didsay, “There is a great deal more to this story; but I cannot tell it—yet.”9[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt9] Was this a clue?Sharron Lowena’s paper “Noscitur A Sociis: Jenner, Duncombe-Jewell and theirMilieu” revealed hard evidence for Ashburnham and Mathers securing armsshipments from Bavaria in 1899.10 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt10] Close to theaction was the Legitimists’ cryptographer Henry Jenner (1848–1934), “Bard ofCornwall” and chancellor of the Society of the White Rose. Jenner handled secretnegotiations with Bavaria and elsewhere. Having been informed of Jenner’santi-Hanoverian convictions and secessionist politics, Queen Victoria turned herback on Jenner at the Stuart Exhibition of 1889, where she is reported to havesaid with disdain, “I have heard of Mr. Jenner.” According to the New York Times(January 16, 1913), Her Majesty also snubbed Lord Ashburnham when Gladstonenominated him for the position of lord-in-waiting.11[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt11] Crowley knew Jenner through Duncombe-Jewell.Perhaps Crowley knew a lot of people the government would like to have knownabout, though who can doubt Salisbury had his sources? The Primrose Leagueitself provided strategic intelligence for the Conservative Party.As is well known, Crowley advanced quickly through the Golden Dawn orderstructure. Barely a year of progress through the seven grades of the “OuterOrder” had passed before Crowley appeared an intimate of Mathers and, as AdeptusMinor, crossed the portal to the “Second Order” of the Ruby Rose and Cross ofGold, whose ascending grades led ultimately, on paper at least, toGod–Self-realization and a role within the purposes of the Order’s supposedpreternatural “Secret Chiefs.” Partly due to existing fissures and rivalries,Crowley’s progress through the Order elicited dismay among some members inLondon, particularly Irish, pro-Fenian poet William Butler Yeats (1865–1939),who for not altogether comprehensible reasons—other than Yeats’s eventualopposition to Mathers—despised Crowley, a contempt Crowley, refusing to takeoffense, characteristically laid at the door of pique at Yeats’s alleged senseof poetic inferiority to Crowley! Few concur with Crowley’s self-assessment, butestimates of poetic values have changed considerably since 1900. There wasdoubtless more to their rivalry than poetry, for according to the accountCrowley maintained to the end of his life—part fictionalized in his story “Atthe Fork in the Roads” (1909)—Yeats seriously threatened him in 1899 using blackmagic via the vampiric agency of alleged accomplice, doomed artist-designer andpoet Althea Gyles (1868–1949) of the Slade School of Art, whom Crowley alsofancied and whose artwork he appreciated. Sexual jealousy probably played apart, and perhaps political suspicions also festered between the poets.Dear Kelly,Let me know how Pelleas is going and if I can help you in any way. . . . Whatabout my design? I have seen a drawing of Althaea [sic ] Gyles which I shall usein some way, unless it is expensive, and you are less cantankerous than usual.Signed “To the re-seeing I kiss your hands and your feet” (Pollitt).*9[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft9]Tata, Aleister Crowley12 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt12]Yeats had been an enthusiastic admirer of redheaded Gyles (she had designed bookcovers for him) but withdrew support when in 1899 he learned of her involvementwith Leonard Smithers, dismissed by critical observers as a drunkenpornographer. While Smithers published Crowley’s earliest work, Crowleydetermined, in late 1899, to frustrate Smithers by loading him with unpaidpublishing debts. Crowley wrote to Kelly sometime in November–December 1899:Will you do me a great favour? Get Green Alps [Crowley’s unpublished poetry]from Smithers if you possibly can—several copies. Say you have seen me and Ishall not communicate with Smithers till Green Alps is published. If you can getany things you know I shall like for me on credit, &c so: perhaps this best donefirst. But I must increase my debts to Smithers at all cost. You should in anycase buy most of my “Jezebels” [poetry by AC] in his possession and as many asyou can of my Japanese “Book of Second 50 drawings” [?] as you can. And when youget the bill, say you’ve paid me. Also get a dozen of “Stains” [Crowley’sdecadent work, White Stains].13 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt13]Crowley was either trying to annoy Smithers deliberately or to make Smithersfinancially dependent on him and therefore disposed to be amenable to obtainpayment, for reasons of Crowley’s own, probably connected with Althea Gyles,whom Smithers seems to have removed from Crowley’s involvement. Gyles may haveconstituted the nub of Crowley and Yeats’s bad relations.As easily as Crowley ascended to the upper echelons of the Golden Dawn—withoutbothering, or feeling able, to cozy up to the dominant faction of the LondonIsis-Urania Temple—he familiarized himself with the Legitimist plot to secureCarlist victory in Spain. He claimed in his Confessions to have been knighted byan unnamed lieutenant of Don Carlos for his services, whatever that might mean.It probably happened at Ashburnham’s Welsh estate where in 1899 Carlistvolunteers expecting to serve in Spain’s northern provinces convenientlyreceived training.Surviving Ashburnham correspondence contains telegrams and accounts relating tothe purchase, equipping, and maintenance of Ashburnham’s steam yacht, Firefly.14[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt14] Commanding the yacht, Thames Valley LegitimistClub member Vincent J. English*10 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft10] oversaw theloading aboard of a hold full of Gras rifles from Bavaria.15[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt15] The Firefly duly steamed south in early July 1899but failed to reach Spain. Somebody tipped off the Spanish consul at the port ofArcachon, near Bordeaux. The consul pressed French customs and on July 15 thevessel was seized. Letters in the Ashburnham papers to the British viceconsulate at Arcachon reveal a tense showdown over possession of Ashburnham’sprize steam yacht.16 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt16] Ashburnham got his yachtback, but the conspiracy was exploded.Sharron Lowena’s study of Cornish Carlists draws attention to a name on theyacht’s pay list dated August 26, 1899: one “C. Alexander.” Spence considersthis possible twist on “Alexander Crowley” might just stand as one of “agentAleister’s” first aliases; it might just as well not, and scanty evidence isagainst putting any weight on the identification, especially as a July 8, 1899,interview with Crowley in the Pall Mall Gazette about fatalities on Beachy Headputs him in London preparing for a mountaineering tour of Switzerland and theTyrol at the time of the Firefly’s fateful voyage. However, Spence’s singularobservation brings us to his most audacious speculation as regards AleisterCrowley and the British intelligence apparatus. Spence poses the question: Whatif Crowley was encouraged to involve himself with Mathers’s affairs so that hecould inform on the Order chief ’s clandestine political activities? Spencebelieves Crowley’s subsequent conduct—his role in the April 1900 revolt thatsplit the Order apart amid exposure of Mathers’s antiestablishment politics, forexample—attains greater intelligibility when seen as Crowley operating as agentprovocateur executing a secret mission.Spence’s admittedly speculative, though doubtless compelling, scenario beginswith Crowley at the end of his second year at Cambridge, still intending acareer “in the Diplomatic.” Crowley’s own account was that at this point in hisuniversity career he entered a personal crisis in which, realizing the ultimatefutility of all worldly honors, he lost faith in his ambitions, abandoned hisformer course, and embarked instead on a life of spiritual exploration andservice to invisible governors of human destiny, having come to the conclusionthat all meaningful change is effected by spiritual causes. What if, asksSpence, Crowley did not abandon completely his original ambitions for diplomaticservice, as his own story goes, but rather accepted a wholly clandestine role toserve the powers-that-be, a role he could never reveal?Readers, kindly note that we only enter this territory because Spence’shypothesis, and the complex issues it raises, may help us to assess moreaccurately Crowley’s many mysterious activities in America following his firstvisit to New York in July 1900.Crowley was still a student when in the summer of 1897 he first traveled to St.Petersburg, which, he tells us in his autobiography, was undertaken to learnRussian, the Diplomatic Service requiring foreign language skills. At the time,Russia was deemed as great a threat to the British Empire as Imperial Germany’sexpansionist naval and territorial ambitions. Spence asks us to considerCrowley’s presence in St. Petersburg as a kind of dry run for intelligenceservices to come, especially as Don Carlos’s son Don Jaime, favored by TsarNicholas II, had received a Russian Imperial Army commission the previous year.Foreign Office hawks may have interested themselves in knowing if the tsar alsofavored Don Jaime’s father’s plans. This seems a tall order for a studentlacking a natural facility for modern languages. Nevertheless, with Crowley’sCambridge studies completed a year later, and having in the meantime come into aprivate fortune, Spence’s hypothesis has Crowley moving in on Mathers’s world bysniffing out Julian Baker of the Golden Dawn in Switzerland.Crowley had read Golden Dawn member A. E. Waite’s The Book of Black Magic and ofPacts (1898) and ensuing correspondence with Waite had, Crowley stated, whenjoined to Baker and Jones’s promptings, crystallized his desire to approach thesecret body of adepts of spiritual wisdom. Following Spence’s hypothesis, byusing chemist-alchemist Baker to get into the Golden Dawn, Crowley could enterthe Legitimist conspiracy while simultaneously satisfying his interests inmagical psychology and spiritual effects, interests common to otherdistinguished men of Trinity College. These included Crowley’s older friend,barrister, naval officer, and—note—World War I intelligence officer, theHonorable Francis Henry Everard Joseph Feilding (1867–1937), and Britain’sleading anthropologist, James George Frazer (1854–1941), author of the classicThe Golden Bough: A Study in Comparitive Religion (1890), which greatlyinfluenced Crowley’s thinking about religion when he lived in America.CROWLEY AND “MACGREGOR” MATHERSIt is perhaps curious that when Crowley met Mathers in Paris in early1899,Mathers was prepared to deal with an Englishman whose card announced him as“Count Vladimir Svareff,” but then cash-strapped Mathers also enjoyedself-granted titles such as, “Count of Glenstrae,”*11[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft11] for example, and believed James IV ofScotland—that royal patron of alchemists—was his former incarnation. Theprevailing view has been that Crowley emulated Mathers’s pretensions. WhileCrowley enjoyed role playing, and was in youth afflicted with snobbish vanity,the following previously unpublished letter to Gerald Kelly offers another slanton Crowley’s adoption of the title “Lord Boleskine”; that is, his being properly“laird” of Boleskine and Abertarff.Just a note re the title [Lord Boleskine]. We needn’t quarrel. Aleister Crowleyis my nom de plume, but (intra nos)†12 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft12] Rose[Crowley’s first wife] is keen on it; so must I seem, if I am to go back to theEast. “Lord” is not an English title, but a courtesy title which for exampleScotch judges take. My bitter enemies in Inverness opposed me for a week andgave in at once when I explained. I did not know Camberwell [Kelly’s home] wasso severe. B.K. [Rose’s mother Bridget] addresses her daughter as LadyBoleskine. Enough: I am not annoyed, especially when you overwhelm me with themasterpiece “I naturally shall do as they do.”—’S’truth I break down again everytime I think of it!17 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt17]Spence suggests the moniker under which Crowley lay “perdu”‡13[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft13]18 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt18] in the heart ofLondon at the time may rather have been part of elaborate schemes undertaken bythe Special Branch to smoke out Russian anarchists and agents around London’sWest End: a serious concern for Britain’s security services at the time after aseries of terrorist atrocities. Such might explain the mystery of “CountSvareff’s” flat in Chancery Lane being watched by police.Crowley was at London’s Hotel Cecil when on January 15, 1900, he received twoletters from Miss Evelyn Hall saying, “You (and all your friends at 67 [ChanceryLane]) are watched by police. This is connected with ‘the brother of a collegechum’ but no doubt can be entertained of the meaning of her hints. She naivelyassumes the charge to be true.”19 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt19] Crowley doubtedEvelyn Hall’s story.*14 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft14]20[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt20] It is possible that any police observationderived from Crowley’s enemies in the Order, in particular Frederick LeighGardner, who condemned Crowley for alleged promiscuous liaisons with men andwomen and tried to trap him.21 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt21] It is alsoperfectly possible that Crowley hung out under a pseudonym so that hisinvestigation of magic, black and white, should not come to his family’s notice.He may simply have been getting entertaining mileage out of what he’d picked upin St. Petersburg.image [images/9781620556313_005.jpg]Fig. 1.2. Evelyn Hall (L’Épée by Alfred-Pierre Agache, 1896; Ontario ArtGallery)Years later Crowley would claim his reason for acting incognito was a playfuldesire to extract obsequiousness from tradespersons, ironically observing theirbehavior for its psychological value. Conversely, he claimed that he did notwant members of his family to know about his occult experimentation in ChanceryLane. These explanations may be disingenuous. Crowley foisted his “CountSvareff” card on all comers, not just tradespeople. According to Spence’stheory, there were no accidents in Crowley’s progress after Cambridge—themeeting with Baker in Switzerland, the cultivation of Mathers, joiningAshburnham’s Carlists—all together suggested to Spence a spy’s desire toinfiltrate Legitimist intentions. “Everything about his association with theHermetic Order of the Golden Dawn smacks of an agent provocateur.”22[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt22] There is no doubt Crowley’s behavior contributedto bringing the Order’s simmering personality conflicts to the boil. But ifspeculation of this order is permitted to fathom obscurities, then it might alsobe speculated that Crowley simply enjoyed the role of occasional agentprovocateur on his own terms and to satisfy his own anarchic tendencies, tastefor adventure, pleasure in posing, and outré, sometimes contradictory, politicaland spiritual enthusiasms.When Mathers’s authority in the Golden Dawn was challenged, Crowley believed itwas chiefly because certain members of the Second or Inner Order knew thatMathers had gone to Paris to facilitate plots against the governments of Spain,Portugal, and probably Great Britain. Legitimists dreamed of a Britain rid of“usurper” Victoria and her successor, the Prince of Wales, by offering the crownto Prince Rupprecht (“King Robert”), the son of Maria Theresa Henrietta Dorotheade Austria-Este-Modena, descendant of the House of Stuart.*15[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft15]Crowley may conceivably have received an initial directive to observe Mathers’sactivities, but when Order opposition to Mathers developed into an outrightattack on Crowley himself (because Crowley was seen as Mathers’s delegatedmuscle), the idea of reforming the Golden Dawn may possibly have assumedpriority in Crowley’s plans, based in part on his belief that the Order harboredpersons he would later describe as “Black Brothers.” Black Brothers were, byCrowley’s definition, persons committed to imposing negative, destructive, ordepressive spiritual beliefs, frustrating long-term plans of the invisible“Great White Brotherhood” that he believed guided humankind and to whoseabsolute service Crowley felt himself pledged. As far as Crowley was concerned,the purposes of the White (magic) Brotherhood included the integrity of GreatBritain and—as we shall see—Britannia’s future alliance with the United Statesof America.It is also the case that eruptions in the Golden Dawn coincided with Crowley’sdedicated performance of the Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin the Mage, by which hewas bound by oath to overcome opposition and temptation from the “evil Princesof the World.” He was to expect perilous frustration and was encouraged by closefriend and tutor in magic, Allan Bennett, to see physical opposition as avisible correlate of spiritual evil lined up against one who aspired to supremespiritual attainment. Crowley was already living out a dynamic inner drama onthe stage of the real world.Crowley’s personal commitment to progress in the Golden Dawn structure evenextended to offering sincere help when encouraging the younger Gerald Kelly tofollow in his footsteps. For Crowley, the spiritual ideal of the Order owned asublimity transcending politics. Nowhere do we find Crowley gloating orrejoicing over the split that inexorably unpicked the seam of the Order, whichprocess was, anyway, well advanced before he arrived on the scene. Crowley’sarrival may have been catalytic, but how could he have known that beforejoining, unless of course he intended it to be so? Mathers called for loyalty;Crowley gave it. All indications are that Crowley had first expected what Orderpropaganda offered: a romantic continuity of the ancient and spiritual OrderR.C. (Rosy Cross). One may also discern from Crowley’s letters of the periodthat he took the Order’s doctrines seriously without ulterior motive andrecommended assiduous attention to them from people he cared about.In late 1899, beneath gold-headed notepaper bearing Clan MacGregor mottoes—’Srioghal mo dhream, “My race is royal,” and “E’en Do and Spare Not,” meaning “inwhat you do, no expense is too much” (a preemptive corollary of “Do what thouwilt”)—Crowley addressed Neophyte Gerald Kelly, concerning Order exams.Care Frater E.S.D.,Do your exam for exam purposes.

Had it beenCrowley’s aim to provoke revolt, he might have been expected to detach himselffrom the inconvenience of initiating fresh adepts. Instead, he calls on Kelly todo his bit and expresses relief to find Mathers’s—and his—opponents absent. Hehas no contention with Mathers and seems simply glad to see the back of personswho, in his view, were ill-equipped for the magical enterprise in the firstplace.MacGregor of Boleskine, Hotel Great Central, LondonCare Frater,There will be a meeting of Gimage [images/dots.jpg]Dimage [images/dots.jpg][Golden Dawn] one day next week to initiate Madame Lucile Hill.†19[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft19]You [Frater E.S.D. = Gerald Kelly] will be requested to act as an officer, asthe number of members in Isis-Urania No 3 has been reduced.

AC26[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt26]On the inside folded sheet of the above letter, Crowley left carefulinstructions for Kelly as to how to make the “Lamen of Dadouchos,” appropriateto Kelly’s grade of Zelator. What looks to us today like a Nazi symbol wasunderstood by the Order in 1900 as the Hermetic Cross, known also as Fylfot,hammer of Thor, and swastika (a Sanskrit health symbol), formed of seventeensquares, representing the sun, the four traditional elements, and twelvezodiacal signs. Crowley made two helpful drawings, “badly drawn here,” andshowed pictorially how to attach a tag so that the lamen could be hung aroundthe neck: “Let it be drawn accurately on a circular lamen with a tag to hang so.I have ordered the collar myself. The [symbol] is in white on a black ground. Itis on both sides of your lamen alike.”Even in the years immediately after Mathers’s rift with most of the LondonOrder, Crowley recommended that Gerald Kelly—who removed himself to Paris ongraduating from Trinity Hall, Cambridge—keep in touch with Mr. and Mrs. Mathers.On December 13, 1901, Crowley, in Calcutta, asked Kelly, “Seen Gimage[images/dots.jpg]Dimage [images/dots.jpg] in newspapers? You should call onMacGregor [Mathers] of Paris.”27 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt27] Again, returningto Europe from India, Crowley wrote to Kelly from Cairo on October 22, 1902.Dear Gerald, . . . I come via Marseille to Paris. I have business also with the Chiefs ofthe Order [Mathers and his wife] of which I have recently heard so much and seenso little. But I do not wish my presence in Paris known till the Hour ofTriumph, or some hour like that: so I will accept your kindness in the samespirit in which I have always received your insults and drive straight off toMontparnasse [where Kelly rented a studio at 8 bis Rue Campagne 1ère]. I knowthe Boulevard Montparnasse, not your street though. I am not likely to go toEngland until certain arrangements are made—tell you what later. . . . Get andcram up Michelet “Histoire des Templiers.”*26 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft26]Ever,Aleister Crowleyimage [images/9781620556313_0101.jpg] Can’t say when, as I am waiting for cashto see Pyramids &c. while I am here dictating the story of my journey to astenographer. Result abject as literature. I will wire from Marseille. A.C.28[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt28]Three days later, Crowley wrote to Kelly from Cairo’s famous Shepheard’s Hotel.“I most probably leave Port Said November 3 to Paris via Marseille. . . . Ishall perhaps write SRMD [Mathers’s motto as “MacGregor”] and Vestigia [MoinaMathers’s GD motto, Vestigia Nulla Retrorsum]. I suppose you see themoccasionally.”29 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt29] It is, of course, possible thatCrowley felt it important to maintain links with the Order of which he was stillpart, while also keeping a watch on Mathers’s political activities, but ifwatching Mathers was an intelligence objective, why spend from June 1900 toNovember 1902 out of Europe altogether? Well, by 1902 a Carlist rising in Spainwas out of the question, and if there is anything to Spence’s agent provocateurhypothesis, frustrating Legitimist plots in 1899 and 1900 would havesufficiently satisfied government. However, Spence’s argument must still contendwith Crowley’s straightforward declaration that he supported the Legitimistcause, until, that is, he saw it as a Catholic-inspired subterfuge. Then thequestion would be, precisely when did he realize that? Crowley’s personalpriorities were spiritual and occult, combined, as ever, with art andexploration for sport and enlightenment.There is another aspect of Crowley’s general approach to situations that castsdoubt on Spence’s idea. It is in fact illustrated in a letter sent to Kelly—nowCrowley’s brother-in-law—from the Hôtel d’Iéna, a little to the south of the Arcde Triomphe in Paris, where Crowley stayed in late autumn 1904. Exasperated bypsychological games and quarrels played out by the women in Kelly’s family,Kelly’s mother and sister particularly, Crowley vented his annoyance forcefully.Womb artists. Ann lied, you remember. . . . Their idea is to arouse sympathy;they suppress or subtly alter to suit; more rarely they fabricate—“more rarely”because they lack imagination in common with other high mental faculties; beingfools, they usually fail even to attract the sympathy.R [Rose, Crowley’s wife and Kelly’s sister] has written me any number ofexquisite letters to stir me up against F.F.K. [Rev. Frederic Festus Kelly,Rose’s father], B.K. [Rose’s mother] and yourself. This time I had the wit tosee through it. I know they bully her—and so do you, don’t deny it!—but there isno reason for embroiling an already strained situation. . . . You do bickerdreadfully between yourselves; and I think the painter Gerald Kelly [whomCrowley is addressing] like the poet A.C. had best follow Christ’s advice aboutleaving father, mother &c. all the prohibited degrees in fact—and follow Art.The above is really my doctrine of Non-Interference—call it the Primrosedoctrine, if you will. But I am sure you will subscribe to it.Yours more than ever,Aleister CrowleyP.S. as soon as I can settle in a flat.30 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt30]While reference to the Primrose doctrine may alert intelligence aficionados toCrowley’s link through his aunt with the Primrose League, it must surely referin this context to the expression “the primrose path”; that is, to lead, orbetter, to let someone down a path of their own choosing that despite initialattractiveness invites ruin. This was Crowley’s way to deal with most conflicts,and the inspiration clearly came from Christ’s spiritual guidance, probablyinculcated by Crowley’s father, the Christian preacher, adorned with Blake’swisdom that “if a fool would persist in his folly, he would become wise” plus atouch of friend Allan Bennett’s Buddhist nonreactionary,dispassionate-compassionate approach to the world. Don’t interfere with a fool;let them learn. There is no cheating in spiritual matters; no short cuts. AfterLondon members split with the autocratic Mathers, the Order degenerated intofragments, its magic, its larger influence depleted. Crowley would take thesword, melt it down, and, by the end of 1908, forge a new magical weapon thathas survived to this day, through perpetually strained circumstances. In theend, when Crowley picked the “winning side” in the conflict, it turned out, ashe would see it, to be his; that is to say, the gods’ side.To Crowley’s observation, Mathers too in due course found himself on theprimrose path; what had once appeared a character of authority became bloatedinto self-defeating egoism and delusion. Crowley felt an estrangement,compounded by trusted friend Allan Bennett’s own doubts about Mathers’s fitnessto lead. Convinced by 1904 that Mathers had fallen from grace as regards thesupposed Lords of Initiation—Mathers released a magical attack on Crowley inJuly of that year—Crowley would have no qualms in his novel Moonchild, writtenin America in 1917, about presenting the fictional version of his onetimeinitiator as a German spy and tool of the Black Brotherhood. The allegation thatMathers was directly involved in “Jacobite conspiracies to overthrow the throneof England” appeared in a work Crowley published in 1911, a year after Mathershad unsuccessfully attempted by law to prevent publication of Golden Dawnrituals in Crowley’s journal, The Equinox.31 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt31]If, despite existing evidence, Spence’s hypothesis was proved to resemble hiddenfacts inside the case, then Crowley’s battle with the Golden Dawn would stand ashaving been profoundly misread for more than a century. Unfortunately, chiefwitness against Spence’s reconstruction of events is probably Crowley himself.In a newspaper article published in 1935, Crowley appeared fairly direct—with acaveat—about his former activities. “I became a secret Jacobite agent, andfought to restore Don Carlos on the Throne of Spain. . . . What ridiculousnonsense! No: I’m nearing sixty, and it wasn’t nonsense at all.”32[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt32] He still saw something in the cause, or at leasthis part in it, and he does not say, nor does he imply, that he became a “secretJacobite agent” on behalf of the government, or any other body.In the same article Crowley made light of the personal crisis that in hisConfessions he asserted had led to his dropping the planned diplomatic career topursue lasting reality in spiritual action. “It happened at the beginning of mythird year at Cambridge. A trivial illness, but it led to the extraction of atooth. They had economized on the nitrous oxide; and I came out of it into auniverse which was nothing at all but Absolute Pain. I think the experience gavethe last shock to my conventional ideas of Reality. All endeavor is in vain, onthis plane. I must find a permanent material on which to found my work. I beganto look for an ‘invisible world.’ Here scientific training helps. Science iswholly against materialism, as Huxley showed so finally.”Crowley launched the article with a bold statement: “The Adventure of the GreatWork is the only one worth while; for all others are but interludes in thesinister farce of Life and Death, which limits all merely human endeavor. . . .Death makes life futile and fatuous.”33 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt33] One mightof course feel free to interpret that phrase “invisible world” in a dual sense:that of spiritual causes and covert, unseen, or “invisible” agencies ofgovernment. Neither realm excludes the other. But it is interesting that heascribes his career turning point to the realization of futility and, evenperhaps, ultimate meaninglessness, the abyss of existential pain; Crowley maysimply have become a world-transcending nihilist who, unwilling to kill himselfover the pit of nothingness and nullification of values, chose rather to haveenlightened fun with the show, or at least to undertake an extreme adventure theworld, even a damned world, would never forget, and if it did: What of it? “Idon’t give a damn for the whole human race—you’re nothing but a pack ofcards.”34 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt34] Some kind of anarchism would thereonhave represented a political and religious baseline. Smash the lot; have arevolution, and smash that too! It doesn’t mean a thing. Crowley unleashed wasgod, devil, and who knows whom: the ultimate Decadent? Do what thou wilt.In a series of articles published two years earlier, Crowley expressed thecrisis and its dénouement differently again, though in a manner some-whatlending support to our latter possibility, albeit with a more positiveresolution.It was at Cambridge that I perceived the futility of worldly ambitions. I hadwanted to be a poet and to attain to the greatest success in the DiplomaticService, for which the late Lord Salisbury had intended me. Suddenly all theordinary ambitions of life seemed empty and worthless. Time crumbles all; I mustfind durable material for building. I sought desperately for help, for light. Iraided every library and bookshop in the University.One book told me of a secret community of saints in possession of everyspiritual grace, of the keys of the treasure of Nature.*27[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft27] The members of this church lived their secretlife of sanctity in the world, radiating light and love on all those who camewithin their scope. The sublimity of the idea enthralled me; it satisfied mycraving for romance and poetry. I determined with my whole heart to make myselfworthy to attract the notice of this mysterious brotherhood.Then one of the first principles of magic was revealed to me. It is sufficientto will with all one’s might that which one wills. You who read this—whateveryou will you can do. It is only a question of commanding the means.35[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt35]There then follows, in the same article, a curiously ambiguous telling of howCrowley came to meet chemist Julian Baker in Switzerland. “The first proof thatI had of this miracle-working capacity which is latent in every man was this:even before I had issued the call for guidance there was a man at my side toanswer it. But the first call: 1898. In a Bier-halle under the shadow of theMatterhorn I met an alchemist.” That was Baker, strictly speaking, a chemist.“Through his good offices I was initiated into the Order in November, 1898.”There can be little doubt of Crowley’s sincerity here. It makes sense withoutpositing any ulterior motive, though it does not altogether disallow duplicity.We can be certain Crowley was determined to tackle the rocky road of magicaladventure: his amazing life is illustration of that. The only slight alarm heremay come from close attention to Crowley’s words “before I had issued a call forguidance there was a man at my side to answer it.” One might think the referencewas to Baker. However, the next sentence begins, “But the first call: 1898.”Baker’s providential appearance came apparently in response to the first call.But there was already, apparently, a man at Crowley’s side to answer it beforethe call was made. Strange. It might be a pious reference to the foresight ofthe gods—providence—or not. If Baker was not the man intended, we must admitignorance as to who was at Crowley’s side. His Holy Guardian Angel? Who now cantell?There is no getting around the fact that Crowley’s precise personal position asregards motives and beliefs around this period, and subsequently, involves bothapparent contradiction and, honestly faced, not a little mystery, often of atantalizing nature. This characteristic “hall of mirrors” phenomenon will beevident throughout Crowley’s life, seldom more dramatically than during hisuninterrupted five-year sojourn in the United States from November 1914 untilNovember 1919. As Crowley’s sometime friend C. R. Cammell exclaimed in his 1951account of Crowley, “Explain me the riddle of this man!”36[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt36]"},{"pageContent":"TWOimage [images/9781620556313_099.jpg]The Song of the SeaThe persons in whom this power [Poetry] resides, may often, as far as regardsmany portions of their nature, have little apparent correspondence with thatspirit of good of which they are the ministers.

Commanded by Captain H. Spliedt, thefour-mast, single-funneled steamship would bear Crowley across the Atlantic toNew York in ten days. Behind him, the magician left the Golden Dawn in freefallwith hostile London members in definitive breach with Mathers, even as Mathersexpelled them for rebellion. W. B. Yeats and his anti-Mathers associates refusedto recognize Mathers’s initiation of Crowley into the Inner Order, which hadtaken place in Paris on January 23 at Mathers’s Isis-Urania Temple in Paris.They had then thwarted Crowley and Golden Dawn colleague Elaine Simpson’sattempt, on Mathers’s behalf, to “repossess” the Order’s initiatic “Vault,”dedicated to Christian Rosenkreuz, in Blythe Road, Hammersmith: a scuffle overpossession that led to Crowley’s taking a lawyer while Yeats’s colleague inrevolt, Florence Farr Emery, took expensive legal counsel.Contemplating the implications of Mathers’s latest bombshell that the Order’sfounding documents had been forged, Crowley assessed the odds and withdrew fromlegal action. He refocused his sights on the Americas: first New York and thenMexico.Something of the tumult broke into a work composed by Crowley on the high seas.Carmen Saeculare was completed on July 4, 1900, as cargo liner SS Pennsylvaniaapproached the North American coast. Admitting a psychological interpretation,the poem may be seen as an emotional and spiritual retaliation to hostiletreatment by brethren in London, a geyser for suppressed anger venting itself inapocalyptic loathing and extreme, even cosmic, reaction. But there is probablymore to this important Crowleyan testament.Clearly impacted by the imminence of first physical contact with America, we maywonder if Crowley was not somehow mindful of his Quaker ancestry and how thosemore famous nonconformist Pilgrim Fathers viewed their first leaving Plymouth280 years earlier. Perhaps the main difference was that while all partiesresorted to apocalyptic imagery to express themselves, whereas the religious ofold addressed their God as Jehovah, Crowley’s “Lord” in Carmen Saeculare is, aswe shall see, his presiding god of the era, Horus, the red rising sun, avengerof his murdered father, and “ancestral voice prophesying war.”We cannot help noting that in the late Greco-Egyptian version of the Osirismyth, sun god Osiris is murdered by his brother, the evil Seth, whereupon Isis,Mother of life, gathers the scattered corpse, impregnates herself with Osiris’sredeemed seed, and gives birth to sun god Horus or (Greek) Harpokrates. Horuswill avenge his father by killing evil Seth. Crowley believed his father hadbeen “murdered” by Plymouth Brethren colleagues whose religious bigotry eschewedconventional surgery and elected to cure Edward Crowley’s mouth cancer by aspeculative electrical method. Whatever drove the Brethren to their “crime,”Crowley made it his life’s work to destroy. He called the cause of their fatalerror “Christianity.”Its title indicating a secular hymn (that is, “of the world”), or “hymn of theages,” Carmen Saeculare was first published in 1901 by Kegan Paul, Trench,Trübner & Co. Ltd., at Crowley’s expense and with a title borrowed from Horace’sodes in the Sapphic meter. With a small number bound in buckram and printed onvellum for privileged recipients, its sixty-two pages consist of four sections:“Prologue: The Exile,” “Carmen Saeculare,” “In the Hour Before Revolt,” and“Epilogue: To the American People on the Anniversary of their Independence.” Itis unclear from the poem whether Crowley looked forward to his first experienceof the real, as opposed to ideal and poetic, America. It is, anyway, a song ofself-imposed exile.Carmen Saeculare offers insight into the poet’s predominant personalpreoccupations of the time. They might strike us as peculiar, evencontradictory, though contradiction is hardly unknown in the minds of poets. AsWalt Whitman famously ejaculated, “Do I contradict myself? Then I contradictmyself. I am large; I contain multitudes!” The poem’s contents certainly bear onthe issue of Spence’s hypothesis regarding Legitimism and Crowley’s realloyalties, even though the debacle of Ashburnham’s Firefly adventure was nowalmost a year old.Crowley wrote in his Confessions more than two decades later, “Carmen Saecularewas actually the result of a more or less prophetic vision. Some of itsforecasts have turned out wonderfully well, though the century is yet young;others await fulfilment—but I do not propose to linger on merely to obtain somorbid a satisfaction!”2 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt38]There seems little doubt that Mathers and wife Moina were still esteemed byCrowley, for the 1901 publication was dedicated to Mathers’s wife as “Countessof Glenstrae”:I DEDICATEON EARTH MY POEMTO THECOUNTESS OF GLENSTRAE:IN HEAVEN MY VISIONTO THEHIGH PRIESTESS OF OUR LADYISISThe reference to Moina as High Priestess of Isis relates to a project she andher husband had launched in Paris as a means of broadening the Golden Dawn’sappeal. They undertook a semipublic revival of the cult of Egyptian goddessIsis, with the highly artistic and intuitive Moina as high priestess Anari andMathers as high priest Rameses of the Isiac rite. What began in a suburbanstreet in Passy proved so popular it moved, with the help of journalist, writer,and occultist Jules Bois (1868–1943), to a little theater on the Butte ofMontmartre, the Théâtre de la Bodinière.Why had they done it? asked Frederic Lees when interviewing “Count and CountessMacGregor of Glenstrae” for the Humanitarian (February 1900). The count repliedthat it wasn’t what people thought: more decadence! No! On the contrary, it wasto combat the decadence of the time.3 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt39] Crowleyclearly shared something of their enthusiasm, for Isis is present in CarmenSaeculare as inspirational principle of liberty’s revelation.Republished in Crowley’s Collected Works in 1905, with notes by Crowley’sfriend, surgeon, and Trinity Hall, Cambridge graduate Ivor Back (1879–1951), thepoem’s dedication to Moina had disappeared. This was a predictable omissionafter Mathers’s autumn 1904 magical attack on Crowley, when Mathers retaliatedfor Crowley’s defection from the Golden Dawn, a defection grounded in Crowley’sbelief that Mathers had forfeited the “Secret Chiefs” of the Order’s confidenceand authority, an authority Crowley believed had been transmitted to him withthe reception of The Book of the Law in Cairo the previous April.Another detail readers of the Collected Works version would miss was the outlinedrawing of a shamrock, sole adornment to the work’s original green cover. Thisannouncement of a dominant theme of the poems’ prophecies is highly pertinent toCrowley’s adoption of the “cover” (if that is what it was) of Irishrevolutionary advocate in America during World War I.The symbol of Ireland embodies the prophesied resurgence of the Celtic race, atheme recognized by a 1901 review of Carmen Saeculare in the English newspaperthe Daily News. “The poet foresees the dawn of an era of love, justice, andpeace, when the Celtic race shall be restored to their own. There are manystrong, nervous lines, and some exalted thoughts.”*29[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft29]By the time Ivor Back supervised the Collected Works in 1905, Crowley’s stanceon the “Celtic movement” advocated by Mathers, Duncombe-Jewell, and Jenner hadchanged, for the first thing we see there is an asterisk next to the title,leading us to a footnote stating, “Crowley, an Irishman, was [my italics]passionately attached to the Celtic movement, and only abandoned it when hefound that it was a mere mask for the hideous features of Roman Catholicism.”4[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt40] We may believe Crowley had been passionate aboutthe Celtic movement, but Crowley was not, as stated, an Irishman, though hispaternal forebears derived from that country before the eighteenth century. TheCrowleys of Alton, Hampshire, whence Crowley’s paternal family settled, werethoroughly English, though their religion had long been nonconformist Quaker.Crowley’s father, Edward, had broken ranks, first as an Anglican, then byjoining the Exclusive Plymouth Brethren, founded in Dublin in the early 1830s byJohn Nelson Darby (1800–1882).Celtic identity nonetheless continued to resonate for Crowley in the romanticsense. He would tell his son Randall Gair in the 1940s that the surname camefrom Breton aristocracy (“de Querouaille”). Celtic movement romantics consideredthe French northern province of Brittany an ancient Celtic kingdom, as Bretonseparatists do today. The Irish part of the Crowley name, Crowley would assert,was of Irish bardic provenance with more than a hint of mystical mastery, thoughCrowley would also joke about basing any genuine interest in Irish republicanismon this kind of supposition. Systems of government hardly matter; it is thespirit inhabiting them that counts above all. If the spirit can breathe, thesystem should evolve. Man as he is, is not the end of evolution. Such wasCrowley’s maturing view.In 1900 the Saxon receives very poor press from Carmen Saeculare, and Crowleywants it understood that his England, his Britain, is an ancient bond of souland soil, garlanded in green clover, loved by Celts and exploited by Saxonmigrants after the collapse of the Roman Empire in the fifth and sixthcenturies. There is, however, still something peculiar about Crowley’sproclaiming himself an Irishman, having abandoned the Celtic movement by 1905.This was not a momentary identification, as we shall see. Even an Englishprovincial newspaper report on Crowley’s brave but disastrous attempt on theHimalayan mountain Kangchenjunga in 1905 refers to “Mr. A. E. Crowley, Engineerof Ireland.”5 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt41]Crowley seems to have needed an Irish identification to secure his poetic visionof England as coming from outside in, and inside out. He saw himself asEngland’s prophet, much as William Blake had done, and he was familiar with W.B. Yeats’s mistaken belief that Blake’s family derived from an “O’Neil” ofDublin. Crowley simply could not imagine the blood red fire of inspiredprophetic poetry emanating from an Anglo-Saxon, a race famously dismissed byNapoleon Bonaparte as “a nation of shopkeepers”; that is, materialistic,spiritually perfidious, provincial profiteers. An Anglo-Irish commander answeredthe jibe at Waterloo.Crowley also seems to have been affected by Samuel Mathers’s no less determinedstance to be seen as of the once condemned, tragic Clan MacGregor. Mathers likedto be designated by the acronym SRMD from the Gaelic ’S rioghal mo dhream,translated as “my race is royal,” for MacGregors traced their origins to ancientCeltic kings of Ireland. While it seems Crowley did through experience grow outof asserting these romanticisms, something of them undoubtedly stuck: the ideaof spiritual kingship—for example, of becoming an “initiated king”—remainedimportant, as did a link to an ancient race of authentic spiritual and magicalattainment. Crowley was familiar with the legends that made Blake believe theancient biblical patriarchs were Druids connected to ancient Britain, and thusto the House of Stuart; that the Stone of Scone had been the stone against whichJacob slept when he dreamed of the angelic ladder to heaven (Genesis 28:10–17).In 1901, Crowley gave his name on Carmen Saeculare’s cover as “St E. A. of M.and S.” While “St E. A.” presumably refers to “St Edward Aleister,” of “M. andS.” (that is, the “Magpie & Stump” debating society in Cambridge), one cannothelp noticing the capitals practically give us the Gaelic name Seamus,equivalent to Jacob (Hebrew: “one who grabs at the heel”) and James—one thinksof King James IV of Scotland, who practiced alchemy and whom Mathers consideredhis former incarnation, as well, of course, of the hapless legitimate James ofthe first Jacobite rebellion (1715). The detail about Jacob/Seamus as “one whograbs at the heel” may just mean that Crowley is also pulling our leg withregard to some aspect of Carmen Saeculare. Crowley, anyway, could see a funnyside to the poetic tract.It should be recognized that Crowley, when acting according to his ownpreferences, seldom exhibited much more than general interest in contemporaryIrish politics, and his view of Ireland’s political state over the years was insome ways typical of many Englishmen; namely, that the country had plainly beentreated very badly as a result of misguided, sometimes callous and shallow,policies, while the political results of history’s brew constituted an awfulmess that resisted compromise and seemed insoluble to everyone’s contentment.While Crowley’s prophetic outburst of 1900 accepts spirited revolt as theoutcome, he himself never visited Ireland once in his life, nor expressed anywish to, though, it may be allowed, the same may be supposed of many persons ofIrish descent around the world who would nonetheless warm to the idea of SaintPatrick’s Day and consider themselves, even when subjects of other countries, asbeing Irish still. Crowley’s “Irishness” was essentially related to a spiritualideal, a poetic, romantic, even antiquarian Celtic identity—but it would haveits uses. Put another way, Crowley’s repeatedly claimed Irish identity had moreto do with the way he felt about English attitudes and government than about thereal Ireland. At the very least, it means that he did not wish to be identifiedas a typical Englishman, but that may be said of many great and untypicalEnglishmen, for England seldom fully recognizes her great children, certainly intheir lifetimes. In due course we may feel driven to ask whether the poem reallyis a sincere effusion of the poet’s soul and not, say, a psychologicalpreparation for a role. It does give us a key into Crowley’s mind as the SSPennsylvania passed Nantucket Island and approached New York in the coolAtlantic breezes beneath the summer sun.Largely apocalyptic in tone, Crowley’s imagery is redolent of the prophetIsaiah, combined with flashing imagery of crashing waves, vast oceans, stars,brilliant sunsets, and sunrises. It is “the song of the Sea”: the Mother,freedom, death. Its subject is destiny, and the first destiny on the horizon isof course the poet’s own.Reeling from the Golden Dawn’s duplicitous intrigues against Mathers, the CeltCrowley finds himself caught “in the storm of lies and tossed,” but hisopponents should know that while a spiritual exile, he is no coward, runningaway. / “I was born fighter. Think you then my task is done, My work, myFather’s work for men, the rising sun?” He is about his heavenly Father’sbusiness. The poet makes explicit his continued support for Don Carlos asSpain’s redeemer. He sees God judging his native land, likening England to “theancient whore.” Crowley gushes language and syntax redolent of one of Blake’sless successful prophetic poems, “The French Revolution” (1791, unfinished). Aswith Jesus’s judgment of the Temple, no “stone of London” will be left standingon another. The Saxon race will fail, for the country is rotten and thereforeunfruitful, and the “fair country” will be given to those who have suffered longexile: “Yea, they shall live! The Celtic race!” Then there is ambiguity abouthis true position: “And I give praise, and close mine eyes, cover my face, andlaugh—and die” (my italics). He can’t help seeing the other side, the funnyside, and can laugh himself to scorn; he will not always show his true face.In the second part of the poem, Crowley is in the hands of a power from within,analogous to his position in 1904 when, in his account of writing down The Bookof the Law from direct voice dictation, he heard the mysterious voice. “I seethee hate the hand & the pen; but I am stronger” (AL II:11).*30[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft30] The muse of Carmen Saeculare commands, “Take upthy pen and write! I must obey. No shrinking at this terriblecommand! . . . Their fire impulses the reluctant hand. My words must prophesythe avenging day / And curse my native land.”6 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt42] Asa prophet, he must give voice, whether he wills it or no. Isaiah also had tocurse his native land, Israel, but for love of that land and desire that it turnto God. The true patriot does not deceive his country with nationalistic praisewhen its roots are in danger from lack of harsh, unwelcome truth. “How have Iloved thee [England] in thy faithlessness / Beneath the rule of thoseunspeakable!”7 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt43] A footnote to “unspeakable”indicates “The House of Hanover.” Here the “bigoted legitimist” of 1899 strikesagain. Crowley would remain a spiritual Jacobite, one with a longing for avanished England of cavaliers, flush-faced bawdiness, bosomy hostesses, ruraldelights, and spiritual idealism. In his “Simon Iff” stories, written in NewOrleans, Titusville, and New York in 1916 to 1917, Crowley’s detective herowould find his London home at the Hemlock Club, with its customs amusinglyfounded on Jacobite history, such as the moleskin tie, for it was a molehillthat tripped the horse that “King Billy” (William III) rode, so bringing theDutch-born Protestant scourge of Irish Jacobite rebels to eventual death in1702.The next verse predicts the end of Empire and her independence. “O England!England, mighty England, falls!” And taking a leaf from Chamberlain’s Birminghamspeech of 1898—“She hath not left a friend!”8[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt44]—echoes Chamberlain’s warning that England couldnot go on in isolation, without pacts of friendship, preferably with Germany andthe United States.The oracular muse turns Crowley’s attention to the effect on England of the BoerWar raging at enormous expense in manpower and money ever since the two Boerrepublics opened hostilities on October 11, 1899: “Her days of wealth andmajesty are done: Men trample her for mire!”9 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt45]Crowley sees Britain’s capital power diminishing: “Mammon”—“The temple of theirGod is broken down.”10 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt46] Britain’s boast of rulingthe waves will in the end ring hollow. In June 1900 the German Bundesrat wasbusy voting the mighty sum demanded by the Kaiser for the greater expansion ofhis navy. Maintaining naval superiority would cost Britain dear; social reformand charity came second to imperial ambition.Crowley addresses the German Empire: “Let thy sons beware, / Not crowding sordidtowns for lust of gold. . . . / Not arming all men in an iron mould. / Peacefulbe thou: with watching and with prayer. / Be not overbold.” If only, we mightthink, Germany had taken this advice to heart! As for Austria: “Fall, Austria!”“I see thy rotten power Break as the crumbling ice-floe in the thaw. /Destruction shatters thy blood-builded tower.” This was spot-on. TheAustro-Hungarian Empire had but eighteen years to live, and the poet isn’t sorryat all. “Stand, Russia! Let thy freedom grow in peace.” The poet believes Russiawill be saved from invasion by her climate: “And Frost, the rampart of thineiron ease, / Laugh at the shock of war.” Addressing Constantinople, capital ofTurkey: “O Gateway of the admirable East! / Hold fast thy Faith! / Let no mantake thy Crown!” “Mad Christians see in thee the Second Beast, but shall notshake thee down.”11 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt47]The prophetic frenzy next looses the poet’s voice on the United States, with nopunches pulled: “foul oligarchy of the West, / Thou, soiled with bribes andstained with treason’s stain, / Thou, heart of coin beneath a brazen breast, /Rotten republic, prostitute of gain!” He recalls the deliberated carnage of theAmerican Civil War (1861–1865) that wasted the Confederate South and its youth.“Thou, murderer of the bravest and the best / That fringed thy southern main!”12[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt48] Crowley isn’t whistling Dixie here; his tone isquite different from the previous year’s “Appeal to the American Republic,”written, he said in his Confessions, after meeting two charming Americans on atrain between Geneva and Paris. It is difficult to account for the apparentchange, other than his own state of mind. What might have turned his vision ofthe United States from the city on the hill to a gutter of wanton waste? TheCivil War wasn’t exactly recent news.A reading of American newspapers for the time Crowley left England in June 1900elicits only continuity since the time of Crowley’s 1899 “Appeal.” In 1898, NewYork governor Theodore Roosevelt was winning laurels with his Rough Riderscavalry’s heroic feats in Cuba; in June 1900, a first ballot at Philadelphia’sRepublican Convention secured Roosevelt’s nomination as vice president to runwith President William McKinley in the election. Poor McKinley would beassassinated in Buffalo fifteen months later by an anarchist inspired by EmmaGoldman’s incendiary rhetoric; we shall encounter “Red Emma” again.Mainstream American newspaper reports of the Boer War were gener-ally, thoughnot exclusively, sympathetic to the British side, and serious, balanced newsfrom England peppered New York’s front pages most days. When British generalsMethuen, Sir Redvers Buller, and Lord Roberts suffered very hard strategic blowsand bloody losses from sharp Boer tactics in the Transvaal and Orange FreeState, the New York Tribune’s descriptive tone was not markedly different fromthat covering the struggles of U.S. generals Grant and MacArthur againstinsurgents in and around Manila the same month.The New York Tribune did regard with great skepticism a British idea thatsuccess against the savagery of the then very current Boxer Rebellion againstforeigners in China might best be achieved if one country (America), rather thana coterie of other interested parties (Russia, Britain, Germany, and France),assumed the main role of reestablishing the status quo in China. American policywas squarely against any alliance with British or European forces. While inJune, Britain had already committed her marines to protect the European andAmerican (mostly missionary) population in China from massacre, PresidentMcKinley ordered five thousand of his own troops to Peking in response to horrorstories of men, women, and children being hacked to death by the “Boxers” inChina’s world-shaking breakdown of law and order.Prophet Crowley seems to get more to the point in ensuing verses. The finger ofjudgment is pointed against the “politician and the millionaire” who for the“maternal dung” of money have enslaved American workers. However, “Thy toilerssnare thee in thine own foul snare.” He doubt-less refers to trades unionstrikes sparking in the American steel and coal industries.America, the poet cries, must return to its true principles of freedom,humanity, liberty for all—this at a time when lynchings of negroes in the Southregularly made broadsheet front pages—freedom for all men and women, enlightenedby spiritual vision, lest the dollar-obsessed incur the wrath of “thine ownchildren.” When America recovers its founding vision, “Then only shall thyliberty arise; / Then only shall thine eagle shake his wings, / And sunward soarthrough the unsullied skies, / And careless watch the destiny of kings. / Thenonly shall truth’s angel in thine eyes Perceive eternal things.”13[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt49] Crowley saw America’s position in the world asone of greatest responsibility; it must not shirk it by gazing inward, mindfulonly of immediate profits.Such is the judgment. That is not the end. “The Reign of Darkness hath an end.Behold!” Young Crowley points to eight planets together in the fiery sign ofSagittarius at the close of 1899. “This is the birth-hour of the Age of Gold; /The false gold pales before the Gold divine. / The Christ is calling to thestarry fold / Of Souls—Arise and shine!”14 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt50]Crowley says his own “face is shining with the fire of heaven. I move among myfellows as a ghost.” Crowley is the outsider, the “Irishman.” “Only I see thecentury as a child. . . . Stormy its birth; its youth, how fierce and wild! Itsend, how glorified!”15 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt51] This is the Aeon of the“Child!”The penultimate section of the poem “In the Hour before Revolt” makes it clearthat to reach the glorified end, there is going to be war, lots of it.16[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt52] Mars, or Horus, the child avenger, is the godpresiding over transformation. The poet invokes him, “Hail! Hail to Thee, / Lordof us, Horus! [Egyptian god of sun and war] / All hail to the warrior name! /Thy chariots shall drive them before us, / Thy sword sweep them forth as aflame.” Crowley sees his own deepest desires instrumental in the change: “Mycries were the cries that awoke Thee . . . whose footsteps are in the Unknown: /Look down upon earth and behold us / Few folk who have sworn to be free.” Thepoet appeals for “Africa’s desperate sons” and for “We, Ireland,” who “lookupward and yonder” for the time when “The tyrant is shaken and scattered, / AndIreland is clear to the Sea! / Green Erin is free!” Crowley’s ruddy tone offorce and fire strongly suggests sympathy, or at least familiarity, with theprevalent anarchist cause, by which all rulers and orders were to be brought lowin the name of freedom.As for the prophet’s advocacy of the cause of militarily outnumbered Dutchsettlers of the South African Boer (literally “farmer”) republics, though backedby German weapons and munitions, he might best have first absorbed June’s NewYork Tribune review of twenty-five-year-old Winston Churchill’s latest bookLondon to Ladysmith via Pretoria. The American reviewer accepted that NewYorkers might already feel strain from so many new books clamoring for attentionabout the Boer War, but if they had to read one, this one by London’s MorningPost correspondent Lieutenant (resgnd.) Churchill was the best. In it, Churchilldescribed his world-famous escape from a Boer prison camp (dramatized in RichardAttenborough’s 1971 movie Young Winston). Talking to Boers about why they wouldnot accept living under British rule, Churchill found, when he scratched thesurface, that the predominant motive was fear that British governance would give“Kaffirs” (black native inhabitants of South Africa) equal rights to themselvesas subjects. Equality with their old enemies was religious anathema to Boers.Students of prophecy might find Crowley’s prophetic muse somewhat partisan injudgment.The poem’s epilogue is addressed to “the American People on the Anniversary oftheir Independence.”17 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt53]Independence, cries thepoet, involves a duty, for if one calls oneself “son of the free,” that is notto be alone. “Sons of the free” must have common cause with all who are, orwould be, sons of the free, for freedom is a state of being, not a state. Thepoet suspects the “day of your oath to the world” has been forgotten, or takenfor granted and rendered mute or meaningless. “Is its flame dwindled down to anember? / The flag of your liberty furled?” Freedom comes with a price, thatbeing the meaning of the word redemption, the fee paid by, or for, the slavefreed. “The price of your freedom—I claim it! / Your aid to make other men free!/ Your strength—I defy you to shame it! / Your peace—I defy it to beDishonoured! / Arise and proclaim it / From sea unto sea!” The idea implies thatAmerica should challenge England to stand up for the freedom of Ireland, ofIndia “By famine and cholera shaken,” and of the Boer republics in South Africawho offer their lives rather than accept surrender of liberty for the sake ofBritish financial interests (gold and diamonds beneath the land). If Americashould operate on kindred principles, namely that profit is all, and not seizethe time of freedom and justice for all, then “Columbia” will share “the shameand the stain,” then “Your stripes are the stripes of dishonor; / Your stars arecast down from the sky; / While earth has this burden upon her, / Your eagleunwilling to fly! / Loose, loose the wide wings! / For your honour! Let tyrannydie! / I demand it of ye, / Man’s freedom! Arise and proclaim it, the song ofthe sea!”Well! There were doubtless radicals of various hues in the United States whomight warm to Crowley the prophet’s sentiments, but one can imagine the kind ofshort shrift he would get from the American who had ground from hard earth hisand his family’s wealth with his own hands, by sheer hard work, against allodds, by distinguishing himself from his competitors or opponents by grit,individualism, and graft. One thinks, for example, of the tough, if fictional,character Daniel Plainview, played brilliantly by Daniel Day-Lewis in PaulThomas Anderson’s movie There Will be Blood (2007), itself based very loosely onsocialist Upton Sinclair’s 1927 novel Oil! Plainview—inspired by Sinclair’sself-made oil millionaire “James Arnold Ross,” involved with greedy businessmancolleague “Vernon Roscoe” in a real-life government bribe scandal—would glarecoldly into the eyes of Crowley’s high-flown prophecy then spit with contempt.For such a one, independence meant just that: not relying on anybody.Independence for such an American meant the individual was free to do what wasnecessary to do within the law to attain goods and status. There were bound tobe losers, dammit. But in fact, Crowley’s own individualist, anarchic streak wasnot so very far from this bristling position, but for this: Crowley questionedthe values on which such freedom or independence should be based. For him,wealth and attainment were not ends, only means. Death nullified attainment;heaven was not further recompense for the labor of the wealthy. Curiously, interms of what we shall soon discover, Upton Sinclair’s “Ross” has beenconsidered, in his turn, to be based on real Californian oil tycoon Edward L.Doheny (1856–1935), cofounder of the Pan American Petroleum & Transport Company.Doheny was currently busy seeking concessions for oil exploration in Mexico, andMexico was where Crowley would very soon find himself among authentic Americanspeculators and gamblers.As a mournful dawning sun rose on the morning of July 6, 1900, SS Pennsylvaniasteamed slowly passed Liberty on Bedloe’s Island to dock at the HAPAG pier,Hoboken, on the Hudson River’s west side, opposite midtown Manhattan. No longerplying poetic waves, the reality of America hit Crowley like a blast of hot air.Indeed, it was precisely very hot air that hit him, for the horror awaiting hisarrival might seem uncanny fulfillment of his own freshly penned propheticinvocation: “In the hour of Revolt that burns nigher / Each hour as it leaps tothe sky, / We look to Thee, Lord, for Thy Fire.” Fire was the fatal element ofthe hour."},{"pageContent":"THREEimage [images/9781620556313_099.jpg]Out of the Frying Pan, into New York SHIPPING NEWS.

H.] Spliedt, Hamburg June 25 and Plymouth, [Tues.]26, with mdse [merchandise] and passengers to the Hamburg-American Line. East ofFire Island at 7:49 p.m.East of Fire Island. This sighting on Thursday, July 5, 1900, of the SSPennsylvania east of Fire Island on page 16 of the following day’s New YorkTribune is the first authentic, if indirect, reference to Aleister Crowley’sarrival in America. As Fire Island lies more than 35 miles from Hoboken, thesefew lines confirm Crowley’s account that he arrived in New York on July 6.A glance across the columns from the shipping announcement would have revealedsomething of the atmosphere greeting him. “Hoboken was a city of mourningyesterday.” Pressed by grim circumstances, the HAPAG Line’s German rival LloydCompany had been obliged to inter the largely unidentifiable remains of 102workers killed in “last Saturday’s fire” in a specially bought lot at Hoboken’sFlower Hill cemetery. With Lloyd’s temporary offices draped in black, Hoboken’sbusiness had been abandoned for the greater part of the day, while all over thecity flags flew at half mast. The Lloyd line lost three of its vessels, burnedor sunken. Headlines on the Tribune’s front page announced: Bodies of 102WORKERS IN HOBOKEN OIL TANK FIRE BURIED. STANDARD OIL WORKS FIRE AT CONSTABLEHOOK STILL BURNING. OVER $1MILLION LOST. LLOYD TERMINAL DAMAGED.image [images/9781620556313_007.jpg]Fig. 3.1. The SS PennsylvaniaAt 4 o’clock in the afternoon of Saturday, June 30, while the Pennsylvaniasteamed southwest of Greenland, a fire had broken out amid cotton bales andbarrels of oil and turpentine at Hoboken’s Pier 8. Within fifteen minutes highwinds spread the blaze along a quarter of a mile of port. Fire engulfed fourLloyd steamships moored at company piers. Amid scenes of desperate anguish, menbelow the Saale’s deck strained to squeeze out of the portholes, but the windowsto life were too narrow; forced back into the choking corridors and fatalcabins, most of the 150 crew burned to death. While the Bremen was badlydamaged, the Saale and Maine were wrecked, and only a timely tow into the middleof the Hudson saved prize liner SS Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse from the gluttonousflames and asphyxiating black smoke that devoured the river’s east side.Struggling against fierce odds, Hoboken and New York fire departments couldhardly prevent the death toll from rising to 326.As Crowley stepped onto ash-coated American soil for the first time, the NewYork Tribune carried the following bittersweet weather report.WEATHER CHANGES FOR BETTER. There was a change for the better in the weatheryesterday [July 5], but the early hours were as discouraging and as seethingalmost as those of the fourth. When the sun rose the heavens were hung withblack, the great smoke cloud from the Standard Oil fire at Constable Hookspreading over the Bay and ocean and over the green hills of Staten Island,darkening the scenery into mournful gloom. . . . As on the fourth, the mercurystood at 76 [degrees Fahrenheit] at 8am; at 11:35am it had reached 84 degrees,and the worst of the day was over. The humidity at both hours was 63 percent.As if the Hoboken Pier fire was not grisly enough, on July 4, only four daysafter the Lloyd Company catastrophe, as Crowley brought his fiery invocationCarmen Saeculare to a climax, lightning hit Standard Oil’s refinery tanks atConstable Hook by Upper New York Bay. The tanks exploded, sending flaming oilinto surrounding waters. Fire still licked the skies as Crowley arrived. Itwould take another day to extinguish. Casualties this time were relativelyfew—nine injuries—but insurers staggered beneath an eventual $2.5 million ofdamages.There is no mention whatever of the Standard Oil or Lloyd Company fire disastersin Crowley’s account of his arrival, even though the detritus was impossible tomiss. The wreckage in the Hudson was still smoking while the Constable Hook firedarkened the very sky. What Crowley did consider worth mentioning was theweather.Till this time I had never been in any reputedly hot country. I was appalled tofind New York intolerable. I filled a cold bath, and got in and out of it atintervals till eleven at night, when I crawled, panting, through the roastingstreets and consumed ice-water, iced watermelon, ice-cream and iced coffee.“Good God,” I said to myself, “and this is merely New York! What must Mexico belike!” I supposed that I was experiencing normal conditions, whereas in point offact I had landed at the climax of a heat wave which killed about a hundredpeople a day while it lasted.1 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt54]image [images/9781620556313_008.jpg]Fig. 3.2. Hotel Imperial on Broadway and 31stCrowley exaggerates. Had he, as he himself noted, read a newspaper he would haveunderstood that the high temperatures that drove him out of his suite at theeight-story Hotel Imperial on Broadway and 31st Street in quest of iced anythingwere relatively untypical.He insisted, however, that being merely informed of conditions by a newspaperwould hardly have compensated for the risk of condescending to consult one.I had already learnt that even the finest mind is bound to perish if it suffersthe infection of journalism. It is not merely that one defiles the mind byinflicting upon it slipshod and inaccurate English, shallow, commonplace,vulgar, hasty, and prejudiced thought, and deliberate dissipation. . . . Peopletell me that they must read the papers so as to know what is going on. In thefirst place, they could hardly find a worse guide. Most of what is printed turnsout to be false, sooner or later. Even when there is no deliberate deception,the account must, from the nature of the case, be presented without adequatereflection and must seem to possess an importance which time shows to beabsurdly exaggerated; or vice versa. No event can be fairly judged withoutbackground and perspective.2 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt55]Contemporary U.S. newspapers undoubtedly offer us background and perspective forpenetrating Crowley’s otherwise seductive rhetoric. Rather than “about ahundred” dying a day, we find in the New York Tribune on the day of his arrivalthat “Julius Hartenstein, 28 years, of 402 East 18th Street” was “overcome bythe heat at 128 William St., and removed to the Hudson St. Hospital,” while“Kate Roesen of 219 73rd Street” was also “overcome at her home and removed tothe Presbyterian Hospital.” The official forecast for July 6 was “partly cloudy,stationery temperature.” If generous, we may suppose Crowley’s mind had over twodecades confused the death tolls from the disastrous fires with the weather. Ofcourse, the oil fires were not disastrous to him.It is undeniably exciting to see Crowley’s quest for the benefits of cold waterconfirmed by delving into the news. A Tribune headline on page 6 the day ofCrowley’s arrival announces: “CITY USING STORED WATER. LITTLE FALL OF RAIN INCROTON WATERSHED IN JUNE AND JULY..” While New Yorkers feared a water shortage,officials claimed there was enough stored for another 100 to 150 days.Temperatures were expected to ease toward the end of the month. The highesttemperature for July 6 was 82°F, the lowest 73°. “Forecast for Friday andSaturday: partly cloudy and warmer today, continued warm. West New York State,showers and thunderstorms. Average temperature 77½°.”It was hot—as was the latest news. The Tribune’s main headline that day reportedthat violence perpetrated by fanatical Chinese Boxers (“Righteous and HarmoniousFists”) had reached crisis point since the Dowager Empress Cixi’s June 21declaration of war on all foreigners. The Chinese Guangxu emperor and hiswife—under house arrest at Empress Cixi’s bidding in Beijing—were reputedly deadby poison: a report conforming precisely to Crowley’s assessment of newsaccuracy. (They were both alive.) Meanwhile, hostile Chinese had severed theinternational forces’ retreat from Taku. The interests of the United States,Germany, France, Great Britain, Russia, Japan, France, and Italy were at stake:all compelled to demonstrate rare unity of purpose. While things looked bad forthe international legations under siege in Beijing, things looked better forWilliam McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt, whose nominations as president and vicepresident, respectively, were heartily endorsed by the Republican NationalConvention in Philadelphia.At the Democrats’ National Convention in Kansas, meanwhile, William JenningsBryan received presidential nomination with Adlai Ewing Stevenson as his runningmate, the nomination delayed over conflict concerning Bryan’s “16 to 1” ratio ofsilver to gold proposition—as against McKinley’s insistence on “sound money”(gold). While the Tribune lampooned Bryan with a cartoon of him sporting a crownasserting “I am democracy!” standing high on the shoulders of figuresrepresenting “Anarchy” and “Spoils” (Trusts), Bryan’s rhetoric remainsnoticeably in tune with Crowley’s poetic strictures as to the United States’future. Advocating resistance to the temptation of imperialism, while embracingthe social advantages of “free silver,” Bryan declared, “The nation is of ageand it can do what it pleases; it can spurn the traditions of the past; it canrepudiate the principles upon which the nation rests; it can employ forceinstead of reason; it can substitute might for right; it can conquer weakerpeople; it can exploit their lands, appropriate their property, and kill theirpeople; but it cannot repeal the moral law or escape the punishment decreed forthe violation of human rights.” Republicans, in their turn, propagandized thatBryan was a dangerous fanatic, a religious nut supported by anarchists.3[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt56]The Tribune, with some Republican bias, reported Theodore Roosevelt generatinggreat enthusiasm by stirring speeches at Hannibal, Missouri, and Quincy,Illinois. Elsewhere, the paper reflected current concern over “Imperialism” inU.S. policy and the government’s support of Great Britain, though the paper wasgenerally warm toward Britannia. Missouri governor Roos in a speech at Hannibalseemed to be groping either for spiritual values or a sense of imperial destinywhen he reflected that “we have seen during recent years marvelous materialprosperity in this country, and material prosperity must be one of thefoundation stones on which we build. But we must have more than that if thenation is to rise to what it should be and will be.”A small patch of a Tribune column publicized calls for help to alleviate faminein British India while another minor notice reassured American visitors to themighty Paris Universal Exhibition, running from April to November to demonstratea century of progress, that the Tribune could be purchased daily at MonsieurLouis Vuitton’s establishment at 1 Rue Scribe, opposite the Grand Hotel. Crowleyhad left Paris the day before the exhibition opened on April 14, withinstructions from Mathers regarding the London rebellion. While there, Crowleyhad probably read specialist Parisian journal l’Initiation, edited by “Papus”(Gérard Encausse), head of the dominant French esoteric orders, which that monthannounced provisions of Papus’s “Martinist Order” for the Universal Exhibition.ORDRE MARTINISTEDuring the duration of the Exhibition, the Martinist Order will hold severalformal sessions in Paris, all lodges uniting, and will invite to these sessionsBrethren with passage to rites affiliated to the Order [such as the “GnosticChurch”]. A special room has been prepared for the purpose.The Velléda Lodge has inaugurated its obligations by invitations for aconference with projections on Symbolism taking as an example the church ofNotre-Dame de Paris. The first meeting of this kind*31[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft31] was a lively success.Crowley might envy Papus who had created an international, spiritually orientedmovement, as much a part of the real world of 1900 as the Universal Exhibition.It might also be noted that the initials of Crowley’s detective creation “SimonIff” are in fact the acronym for the highest grade of the Martinist Order:Simage [images/dots.jpg]Iimage [images/dots.jpg]—that is, Supérieur Inconnu, orUnknown Superior. The inspirational source of the Martinist Order, Louis Claudede St. Martin (1743–1803), was known, so to speak, as “the Unknown Philosopher,”a role Crowley saw repeatedly as his own, even as the “Unknown” backed into thelimelight.According to Crowley’s Confessions, it was while reporting to Mathers in Paristhat the latter introduced Crowley to “two guests, members of the Order.”†32[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft32] Crowley records, “They had just come back fromMexico. The fancy took me to go there. I wanted in particular to climb the greatvolcanoes.”This disingenuous introduction to Crowley’s embarking for New York requires akey to unlock it. Several Crowley biographies have mooted that Crowley headedfor New York in quest of famous opera singer Brooklyn-born soprano Susan Strong(1870–1946), wealthy daughter to the late New York senator Demas Strong. Anerroneous supposition, it derives from confusion between Strong and her operaticunderstudy, Lucile Hill. As a recent neophyte (0° = 0▫) to the Golden Dawn—whoseinitiation was undertaken by Crowley and Kelly as officers—Crowley sought outLucile Hill when she played Venus in Wagner’s Tannhäuser at the Royal OperaHouse, Covent Garden, London, which ran May to July 1900. Remarkably, we maycatch the occasion from a never-before-published note sent by Crowley onCavendish Hotel, Eastbourne, note-paper to Gerald Kelly.Care Frater,I go back to Great Central Hotel image [images/9781620556313_0102.jpg] [symbolfor Wednesday-Mercury’s day] for the Tannhaüser. Our 0° = 0▫ is singing Venus*33[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft33] . . . I shall come to Cambridge for my motor[car] and ride up.4 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt57]Crowley obviously intended to impress by rolling into Covent Garden in commandof his automobile—a very rare sight indeed in London in 1900.†34[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft34] What a scene that must have been!Tannhaüser enjoyed seven performances at Covent Garden in 1900, with only one ona Wednesday, so we may date Crowley’s arrival there precisely to May 30, 1900.5[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt58] We get a glimpse of Crowley’s peculiar view ofLucile from Gerald Kelly’s copy of Crowley’s combination of poetry andmetaphysical essays, The Sword of Song (1904), where in a complex section called“Pentecost,” to the left of a note indicating “Advice to poet’s fat friend,” wefind the following not entirely complimentary verses.While for you, my big beauty, (Chicago packs pork)I’ll teach you the trick to be hen-of-the-walk.Shriek a music-hall song with a double ong-tong!Dance a sprightly can-can at Paree or Bolong!Or the dance of Algiers—try your stomach at that!It’s quite in your line, and would bring down your fat.You’ve a very fine voice—could you only control it!And an emerald ring—and I know where you stole it!But for goodness sake give up attempting Brünnhilde;Try a boarding-house cook, or coster’s Matilda!Still you’re young yet, scarce forty—we’ll hope at three scoreYou’ll be more of a singer, and less of a whore.A pencil note by Crowley to the right of the verses states clearly the referenceis to “Miss Lucile Hill of the Opera,” while next to Crowley’s versified hopethat she mature into “more of a singer, and less of a whore” we find the note:“This hope has been disappointed. A. C. 1911.”*35 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft35]Because Tannhaüser had still to run until July 27 in London, it is inconceivablethat Crowley went to the States in pursuit of Lucile. Error regarding Crowley’smotive stems from failure to note that Susan Strong shared the role of Venuswith Lucile Hill, combined with a cross-reference in Crowley’s Confessions,wherein chapter 23 (p. 204) informs us that his poem Tannhaüser was inspired bymeeting a girl in Mexico City who aroused him to such an extent that he returnedfrom her “slum” with feelings so intensely insatiable that they assumed in hisimagination proportions reminiscent of Wagner’s opera lately dignified by LucileHill.Something in Lucile’s overall performance had undoubtedly stimulated apassionate romance, revealed in Confessions.Yet my principal achievement [in Mexico] had its roots in Europe [hence thebiographical confusion regarding Crowley’s motive in going to America]. At oneof Mathers’s semi-public ceremonies [in Paris], I had met a member of the Order,an American prima donna.*36 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft36] She took me by stormand we became engaged [meaning sexually]. The marriage could not take placeimmediately, as she had to get rid of some husband that she had left lying aboutin Texas.†37 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft37] But I heard her sing Venus inTannhaüser at Covent Garden; and she courteously insisted on my sampling thegoods with which she proposed to endow me. The romance of an intrigue with sofamous an artist excited my imagination.image [images/9781620556313_009.jpg]Fig. 3.3. Lucile HillWhat Crowley did find in New York in July 1900 was not quite the New York wethink of today. Hear his response to the city’s surprising 1900 skyline:In those days one was not bored by people who had never seen a real skylineboasting of the outrage since perpetrated by the insects. A mountain skyline isnearly always noble and beautiful, being the result of natural forces actinguniformly and in conformity with law. Thus, though it is not designed, it is theembodiment of the principles which are inherent in design. New York, on theother hand, has been thrown up by a series of disconnected accidents.6[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt59]New York was not a city of skyscrapers. Even the famous Flatiron wedgelikebuilding on 5th Avenue would not obstruct light of day until 1902. Nevertheless,after the mid-1870s, with Manhattan Island’s size imposing prohibitively highrents for office and living space, new technology answered the call for upwardlymobile constructions on the grand scale. Chief among early users of high-riseconstruction were the masscirculation dailies. At 260 feet, the New York TribuneBuilding of 1875 dominated 154 Printing House Square on Nassau and SpruceStreets for fourteen years, after which it gained a superior and all too visiblerival when the New York World Building at 53–63 Park Row began its ascent tobeat height records for five years after its twenty stories were finally stackedlike a winner’s chips in 1890. The days of Trinity Church’s 284-foot spiredominating the skyline were over. Business meant business. Until 1903, when thepaper moved to Longacre Row (now Times Square), the New York Times made its homein the New York Times Building at 41 Park Row (today “Newspaper Row’s” lastsurvivor).Only two years old when Crowley sought iced water in July 1900, the EmpireBuilding had arisen in all her Classical Revival splendor at 71 Broadway on thecorner of Rector Street. Considered a skyscraper by contemporary standards, sheboasted twenty-one stories and a steel frame curtain-wall construction. Suchscale was, however, fairly rare in the New York of 1900. Most of Manhattan’scommercial buildings were between roughly five to twelve stories in height andenormously varied in architectural quality, depending on the whims and income ofindividuals and companies.The view from the decks of liners arriving at Manhattan was not particularlystimulating in itself: brown and gray warehouses jostled up to the river’s edgein abundance, with many a monotonous flat roof jigging up and down like adigital signal to no great purpose, but the positive effect of so muchcompressed activity gradually thrusting upward would doubtless have beenheightened after rough Atlantic crossings without modern stabilizers.The magnificent Brooklyn Bridge wasn’t in quite the right position to lend thedramatic dominance that would have enhanced the city’s splendor as, say, theSydney Harbor Bridge does so effortlessly, but it definitely contributedatmosphere. Taking the sidewalks along Manhattan’s bustling, but not overfilled,streets would have been a noisy affair, with horse-drawn cabs and cartscompeting for road space with the city trams, rattling along, with theoccasional impertinence of one of the new motorized buggies butting in with itsbarking klaxon like a warning from history. Arriving at Central Park would havebeen a ghostly shock for the New Yorker of today, transported back in time. Forthe most part, the tallest things to be seen were the trees: the skyline waslargely sky. The unique Dakota residential building, stubbornly, forbiddinglyeccentric and resembling somewhat a rather grim, oversized French chateaustretched upward and, denied harmonious wings, to our eyes would have lookedalmost surreal by itself. Built 1850 to 1854, it had emerged, or imposed itself,on 72nd Street when the Upper West Side was hardly developed at all, and fromthe parkland would have reared up solitarily as a massive, uncanny, outsizestately home set upon its own grounds like an austere visitation from a madman’sdream.In the streets Crowley, in his English Savile Row suit, would have passed bybusinessmen in frock coats and top hats, young men in cream trousers wearingstraw boaters, corseted ladies perspiring inside graceful European styles oflong, fabric-rich dresses, sporting elaborate broad-brimmed French and Englishhats with plenteous feathers, their hair hanging loose or in curls at the sides,most becoming. Many men sported a derby and short jackets, trousers, revealinghose, narrow neckties, stiff collars, and collar studs. Boys wore soft caps andknee breeches and could be seen boxing and wrestling in the street from time totime. Policemen were of the Keystone Kops type with bulbous, faintly comical,phallic helmets, swinging truncheons, while a call to the fire brigades broughtforth a train resembling a carnival float or chariot flanked by trotting firemenin huge helmets suitable for medieval warfare.The spirit of liberty was palpable everywhere, Crowley observed; people mindedtheir own business and looked each other in the eye; there was no deference, andrich and poor and the middlin’ sort got on well enough. The spoken manners,however, Crowley found shockingly uncouth, but amusing too.At more than fifty sites on New York’s blisteringly hot streets, Crowley’s hugeears would have felt assailed by piercing yells from poor, often immigrantnewsboys hawking the morning and late editions, crying out the headlines. OnJuly 7, Crowley’s second day in Gotham, whether or not he suffered reading theTribune, he would probably have heard the headline Japan to Have a Free Hand:not the gift of a severed limb courtesy of the Boxers, but Russia’s announcementof her consent for Japan to move 23,000 troops into China. News of “thousands”of Chinese converts to Christianity slain, as well as foreigners, echoed aboutthe city. Crowley had no time for missionaries or converts; he thoughttraditional beliefs should be understood, not replaced. Splashed across theTribune’s front page was a dramatic photograph of the Foreign Concession in TienTsin, encircled by Chinese troops, redolent of scenes reproduced in SamuelBronston’s 1963 epic set during the Boxer Rebellion, 55 Days at Peking, starringAva Gardner, Charlton Heston, and David Niven.image [images/9781620556313_010.jpg]Fig. 3.4. Skaters in Central Park circa 1890 by the Dakota Apartments,constructed 1880–1884.Back in the real July 1900, President McKinley received a cable from KaiserWilhelm II thanking the president for his sympathy over the shocking daylightmurder of the Kaiser’s representative in the streets of Peking.Yes, it would have done Crowley no harm at all to undergo the humiliation ofphysical contact with newsprint. He might have found that he was not alone inhis views and that his philosophy was not unknown either. An interesting piecein the Tribune of July 7 by an American who had recently visited England couldhave invited comparison with or even served as vindication for his 1899 “Appealto the American Republic.” While the article’s author was swift to criticize thestuffiness of English conventions and the absurdly dim view held of his clothestaste, and while the writer tried to forgive the “tyranny of 1776,” he wasnonetheless hugely impressed by the unity and satisfaction with Great Britain’sgovernment shown by the vast majority of folk, as well as the general pleasuretaken in the nation’s victories and in its social and political system.Americans and British have much in common and the logic of events must bring thetwo peoples into closer business and social relations. Even as they dislikeGreat Britain for its strength and progress, so do most of the Continentalcountries dislike the United States. This is no figment of fancy. The Americanisolation of former years, finally made impossible by the growth of steam andelectricity, is no longer a factor in our diplomatic problem. Today America isnot only in the world, but of it. . . . That Great Britain and America will growmore and more friendly and get closer together is as certain as the sun to rise,although, for political reasons, an official alliance is out of the question.7[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt60]As heartily as Crowley might have endorsed the columnist’s insightful view offuture cooperation, he would probably have felt envy had he read of one outcomeof the success of Winston Spencer Churchill’s latest book. Churchill’s Boer Waradventure had attracted so much favorable notice that New York agent Major JamesB. Pond engaged Mr. Churchill, “now in the early twenties,” to deliver a lectureseries in New York beginning in November. Churchill aroused particular interestas his mother (now Mrs. Cornwallis West) was respected New Yorker LeonardJerome’s daughter, and the latter’s grandson enjoyed “a good many Americanaffiliations.” Pond considered Churchill to have achieved as much at twenty-sixas would constitute a brilliant career for most men aged fifty.Crowley’s incipient career as a literary figure had a tantalizingly long way togo. One may ask why Crowley could not bring himself to enter the fray of findinga publisher. Was it pride, impatience, suppressed self-doubt, distaste forpublishing as a “trade,” fear of rejection? All of the above, I think. It is notas though he had nothing to say. Though he was on the verge of the first greatforeign adventure of his life, even his personal interests would have found anaudience. After all, page 10 of the Tribune, in addition to news aboutChurchill, carried a fair review of French astronomer and Theosophicalenthusiast Camille Flammarion’s latest investigation of psychic and occultmysteries, L’Inconnu (The Unknown), just published by C. F. Harper & Bros. inLondon and New York. This was right up Crowley’s alley, especially as itcontained a scientific approach to the issue of the soul and survival afterdeath. Crowley would give his magazine series, The Equinox, beginning in 1909,the rubric “The Aim of Religion, The Method of Science.” There was a market forsuch things if the author could harness his or her thought to the concerns ofthe reader.It was a tremendous experience recently to have in my hands an extraordinarilyrare, and revealing, letter on blue-headed notepaper sent by Crowley to his dearfriend Gerald, back in England. Gerald Kelly may have wondered where his olderfriend had got to. Well, now he could see, for the letter showed a drawing ofthe “Hotel Imperial, Absolutely Fire-Proof [how appropriate!], Broadway at 32ndStreet, New York (Robert Stafford Hotels).”Dear Kelly,I am an unexpected chap, nicht war?

Once or twice I have had acurious experience—entering the astral from below, I found a lot of grand stufffor pomes [sic: archaic for poems]. I wrote it up, and on returning found myverse pure drivel—I had been made a complete fool!Was the Crescent a success?Best Wishes to you and yours,Ever as ever,AC8 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt61]Fascinating how he hopes Kelly and Jones might be able yet to “fix” the GoldenDawn, and obviously expressing some regret as to what had occurred, though onemay not doubt that a mended G∴D∴ would be an Order shorn of rebellious elements.Kelly would leave the whole business behind him, but Crowley and Jones would goon to formulate the A∴A∴ on adapted, streamlined, and reformed G∴D∴ lines in1908. It is also clear that Crowley saw his transatlantic journey in terms ofromantic exile; cultural exile would intensify as a keynote of his early career.Note also Crowley’s skepticism regarding what could be encountered while astraltraveling, here suggesting an experience akin to someone who has written“inspired words” while ingesting psychedelics, only to find in sobriety that theinspiration was illusory or wildly exaggerated in value. Crowley was neithercredulous nor uncritical where magical or spiritual experiences were concerned.Crowley says in his Confessions that he stayed in New York only two or threedays. Perhaps the weather explains why. If the heat was not challenging enough,he and New York in general were confronted on Saturday, July 7, by a tornado!According to the front page account in the Sun newspaper the following day:as the rest of New York City was breathlessly awaiting the thunderstorm thatloomed up in the western sky at half past four yesterday afternoon, awell-developed and able-bodied tornado swept across Manhattan Island aboutSeventieth Street, gave a fillip to a lofty cupola at the river’s edge andswooped down on Blackwell’s Island, where the city keeps its helplessly poor andcages its petty criminals and disorderly characters.The main body of the “aerial riot” kept above Manhattan’s rooftops, but its tail“made some extraordinary wreckage of roofs and trees.” This was on top of asevere windstorm that visited Brooklyn at 5 o’clock on Saturday afternoon.According to the Sun, “nearly 100 trees and several telegraph poles were blowndown in various parts of the borough.” The next day a “Swirler” tornado hit NewJersey, tearing up everything that wasn’t nailed down and cutting off telephonecontact between New York and several coastal resorts. It was observed as beingblack, balloon-shaped with lightning mixed up with it, and it came from thesouthwest heading northeast. Long Branch, Lakewood, Oakhurst, Freehold, andTurkey [old name for New Providence] were devastated with fine old treesuprooted and whole houses whipped up into the air. The roaring devastation wasattributed as a figure of speech to “aerial conspirators,” a phrase Crowley, hadhe heard it, would probably have taken literally as his imagination tended tosee a storm as involving a demonic spiritual cause, and that despite hisscientific outlook.image [images/9781620556313_011.jpg]Fig. 3.5. Central Mexican Railway trainEvidently he concluded he couldn’t stand it any longer in New York and caught atrain south. Destination: Mexico City. For the purpose, he would probably havehad to make two connections. It seems likely he took one of the SouthernRailways Pullman trains with drawing room, sleeping car, and dining services forNew Orleans that left Pennsylvania Station at 3:25 p.m., 4:25 p.m., and ten pastmidnight daily. If he fancied the fastest route, he might well have taken the12:10 a.m. “Fast Mail” train that only called at Atlanta. The Southern PacificCo. Railroad provided his best connection from New Orleans west through Texas tothe U.S. border at El Paso. From there Crowley would have crossed over the RioGrande to Cuidad Juarez, Mexico, where the Mexican Central Railroad would havechuffed him south to Mexico City.The trains he traveled in would have been the kind you have seen in dozens ofwesterns, with huge funnels trailing black vapor, lamps, bells, and cattle-trapgrilles at the front. In his Confessions he observed that normally trainjourneys more than half an hour quickly become tedious, but after two or threedays “one becomes acclimatized.” If Crowley left New York on Sunday, he shouldhave been in Mexico City by the end of Thursday."},{"pageContent":"FOURimage [images/9781620556313_099.jpg]The Eagle and the Snake: Mexico CityMuch as it would be delightful to linger long amid the sunny plains andvolcanoes of Mexico, as Crowley did—an extraordinary sojourn lasting nearly tenmonths from early July 1900 until April 20, 1901—our stay with him mustconcentrate on matters relating most of all to his long-term relationship withthe United States.Now, if we take Crowley’s autobiographical account at face value, we have fewproblems to contend with. His narrative proceeds in this wise: he arrived at thegrand-looking Hotel Iturbide to find the hotel offered little in the way ofservice, while the city seemed devoid either of fine food or vintage wines.People, he says, drank liquor to get drunk. The trainee mage quickly grasped thepoint and adapted to conditions, soon finding himself spiritually, but notalcoholically, in tune with the Mexican people. He says they had little time forcommerce and industry, and their character had not been spoiled by hypocrisy andthe Protestant work ethic. They liked gambling, sex, aguardiente, and their owncongenial interpretation of the Catholic faith. There was room for enjoyment,because Porfirio Díaz, the president who had ruled from 1876 and would continueto do so until 1911, was damn good, as Crowley puts it, at running the country.It was not at all like England, where sex was a continual problem, shrouded inthe sense of shame. In Mexico, even the priests joined in.The English colony, he tells us, was disliked by some and despised by others.The British consul was habitually constipated; the vice consul drunk. Howeveraccurate this may be, Crowley preferred the American colony, which wassubstantial in size and dynamism. Indeed, Crowley gives us little idea of justhow active that colony was in Diaz’s plans for modernizing Mexico, and Americanand European schemes for exploiting it. But then, Crowley’s account is of aMexico serving chiefly as moral exemplar and as a setting for his ownreflections and adventures.These appear to begin with magical practices. He commenced his exploration ofthe “Aethyrs”: inner-plane territories ruled by angelic figures of awesomecharacteristics whose realms were delineated in the sixteenth-centurymanuscripts of English magi John Dee and Edward Kelley, but Crowley confessesthat his limited initiation gave him limited access. Through following his ownline of Qabalistic logic, he discovered the true spelling of the famous magicalspell, corrected by Crowley to “Abrahadabra,” whose gematria or numerologicalequivalent was 418. He also worked on “invisibility” and developed, he says, askill of invisibility by deflection; that is, his state of mind and bodyconcentrated, he could pass by people unnoticed (useful to an agent of course).It was really a kind of trick. He says he passed unnoticed through a city streetin a red robe and golden crown. Redolent of a Crowley leg-pull, his displayperhaps accompanied an outbreak of that carnival spirit generally suppressed byDiaz.He tells us that he acquired a lodging close to Alameda Park (from alamo: apoplar; as well as something to be remembered) in downtown Mexico City. This wasdoubtless connected to what went on in the park. Here he could concentrate onthe benefits of being an exile, for, as he writes with some justice, “theEnglish poet must either make a successful exile or die of a broken heart.” TheAlameda Park was an easy place to make easy contact with female, andbehavior-coded contact with male, prostitutes. Crowley probably availed himselfof both “nymphs and satyrs.” The park, he says, was protected from police.Committed to a part-roué existence, he acquired the services of an accommodating“Indian”—that is, native—girl to keep house, as the expression went, and went onthe prowl. After one sexually delirious encounter in a slum with a Mexicanprostitute with eyes “of seductive sin,” the thought of his passionate adventurewith Lucile Hill came vividly to mind: a typically Crowleyan juxtaposition. Thiscombination of raw sex and high passion led him to pen at an unbroken sittingthe verse play named after the performance in which he had last seen Lucile:Tannhäuser. Its theme, which spouted forth from him in the course of a timeless,sleepless night, was, of course, a troubadour’s spiritual and philosophicalquest for the absolute. It would be interesting to see it performed properly. Ithas some very good lines, but not many, though Crowley’s Tannhäuser is stillmore literate than much that passes critical inspection these days.Still sweeter when the Bowman*43 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft43]His silky shaft of frostLets loose on earth, that no manMay linger nor be lost.The barren woods, deserted,Lose echo of our sighs—Love—dies?—Love lives—in granite skirted,And under oaken skies.The problem, as with much of Crowley’s early poetry, is that he conceived poetryvery much as a technical exercise, a duel of wit and word. Verse and rhymestructure, measurable in terms of expertise, predominate, while into and betweenthese girders he attempts to vent the geyser of his complex thoughts,self-conscious humor, and pent-up ecstasies in search of an elusive poeticbreakthrough. Finding rhymes for difficult, obscure, and quite unnecessarilyambitious words and phrases may appear to us an annoying conceit. Much of thispoetic masochism is forced, unlike his prose, which benefits from a ribald senseof irony, form, impeccable grammar, and legato, laid-back eloquence.Crowley was aware of his need for an editor. When assembling his Collected Workson August 15, 1904, he wrote to Kelly that “in ‘Collected’ there is much carefulrevision—a fair amount cut out. I gave [Ivor] Back a free hand with the bluepencil. The fact is neither you nor I can tell which is the indifferent work.They may know in AD 2904.”1 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt62] Crowley made someinteresting comments about style in a letter sent from Calcutta to Kelly,October 31, 1905. He refers to writer Marcel Schwob and sculptor Auguste Rodin,both of whom he met and worked with in Paris in 1902 to 1904.For all that, you [Kelly] are wrong in sticking in Paris. You ought to bespending your nervous energies on savagery, rather than on the purely falseculture of the “intellectual” prigs. What we have both failed to see hitherto isthat we are prigs, worse—because more knowledged—than the crowd that brainsuckedSchwob, and that still brainsucks Rodin.You are, I think, worse than I, ostensibly at least; for I have pretended todespise my art, while you have always worshipped it. Though our speech hasreversed these roles, this was the truth.Now Shaw [G. B.] is quite right: people who have achieved a true style arepeople who have had something to say and were mad to say it. But the “something”has been assimilated and become instinctive therefore uninteresting or rejected,therefore absurd. Hence the style is the permanent truth, as you have alwayssaid. Your mistake was in not seeing the cause. And thus the ridiculous Miltonand Bunyan are masters as well as the admirable [Thomas Henry] Huxley; and thefilthy minded Baudelaire as the virginal Crowley.Poems and Ballads [Algernon C. Swinburne, 1866] is an orgasm; the later work awet dream. . . . A lily achieves beauty by trying to grow.2[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt63]Something in the clear air of Mexico City and the sight of distant mountainsthat looked so close made him condense his magical ideas into a “Ritual ofSelf-Initiation.” This was undertaken in the form of a dance incorporatingmagical gestures learned in the Golden Dawn and brought to such a pitch ofinward ecstasy that its end was usually unconsciousness. This was of course theway to access the source of magical power: the unconscious, where the gods dweltunchained by reason. Crowley intuitively understood sex as symbol of spiritualattainment.He seems to have had rituals on the mind, for he ascribes to his meeting an oldman he calls Don Jesús Medina the opportunity for initiating the Spaniard ashigh priest in a new, self-created Order of the Lamp of Invisible Light, foundedin Guanajato. Crowley says that he had a degree of permission from Mathers toinitiate likely candidates into the Golden Dawn, but one doubts if this was whatMathers had in mind. Wanting things his way, Crowley wrote “The Book of theSpirit of the Living God,” completed by February 22, 1901, from which tworituals were published in Book II of “The Temple of Solomon the King” (Equinox,March 1910, vol. 1, no. 3, pp. 269–78), dedicated to “Isis, Queen ofNature”—doubtless inspired by the Mathers’s Parisian cult—and based around an“ever-burning” oil lamp that radiated its effulgence onto a series of planetarytalismans, serving as a focus for the initiates’ concentrated thought-energy.Florence Farr and her Sphere group of fellow members of the Isis-Urania Templeemployed similar ideas in London.A diary entry for Friday, April 5, 1901, refers to Crowley, having just returnedfrom San Andrés’s pre-Columbian Aztec religious capital, with its Great Pyramidof Cholula (68 miles southeast of Mexico City), choosing to spend the “night in[the] temple of L.I.L.”—a fascinating jump. In the L.I.L. temple Crowley made aninvocation of the Holy Spirit and “four princes and eight sub-princes.”This detail alerts us at once to Crowley’s inspirational source. From January toApril 1900, Crowley had executed preliminaries to the hazardous Operation of theSacred Magic of Abra-Melin the Mage. The aim: “Knowledge and Conversation of theHoly Guardian Angel” or the “Higher and Divine Genius” by progressive operationsto unite the conscious mind with the divine to gain magical control over fallenorders of being. Unfinished due to answering Mathers’s summons to Paris, Crowleyhad made paper square talismans by invoking Abra-Melin’s classification of fourprinces of the demons (Lucifer, Leviathan, Satan, and Belial) and eightsub-princes (Astaroth, Maggot, Asmodee, Beelzebub, Oriens, Paimon, Ariton, andAmayon)—all subject to the will of the “Lord of the Universe.”In Mexico City, Crowley “assisted” (Don Jesús presumably) in the “morninginvocations.” Crowley considered the L.I.L. conception “sublime” and wonderedhow things turned out later; so might we, but no record has come to light, andthe invisible light remains invisible. Though he does not tell us when he metthe Don (a general Spanish honorific), and this is significant, he relates thatDon Jesús was so impressed by his knowledge of Qabalah (as Crowley preferred tospell it), that he initiated Crowley into the Scottish, or Ancient & AcceptedRite, even to the ne plus ultra of Additional Degree Freemasonry: the 33rddegree.We then hear about the many Americans with whom Crowley became chummy,especially in gambling houses and various ranches (some private, some countryhotels) and of various con tricks and crooked investments being regularly pulledon the unsuspecting. One place he frequented involved a “delicious” electrictram ride from the city to Tacubaya, where a luxurious casino with long tablesstacked with silver dollars dominated the tourist resort. For those with thecash, Mexico had become a fun-seeker’s paradise. Crowley didn’t altogether likethis sort of thing but was interested in what made the American gamblers tick.The psychology of these people really interested me. They had no experience ofthe kind of man who knows all the tricks but refuses to cheat. Their world wascomposed entirely of sharps and flats. It is the typical American conception;the use of knowledge is to get ahead of the other fellow, and the question offairness depends on the chance of detection. We see this even in amateur sport.The one idea is to win. Knowledge for its own sake, pleasure for its own sake,seem to the American mere frivolity, “Life is real, life is earnest.” One ofthemselves told me recently that the American ideal is attainment, while that ofEurope is enjoyment. There is much truth in this, and the reason is that inEurope we have already attained everything, and discovered that nothing isworthwhile. Unless we live in the present, we do not live at all.3[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt64]He mentions two dodgy characters in particular, “McKee” and “Wilson,” as well asa “warm friendship” with “live wire” Parsons, an American doctor who was runningan appendectomy scam with a surgeon-colleague brought out from back home to skimbucks from anyone with a stomach complaint. Judging by the fact that Crowleylater sent Parsons the gift of his Oedipal poem The Mother’s Tragedy after heleft in 1901, Parsons may have been his lover. Crowley was rather drawn to maledoctors throughout his life.After all this, Oscar Eckenstein, Crowley’s much-loved mountaineering colleague,arrived from Europe to join Crowley in undertaking record-breaking climbs, andsome failed attempts, on the highest mountains in Mexico. Then they parted, andCrowley headed for the Far East via New Mexico, San Francisco, and Hawaii inApril 1901.And that would probably be a reasonable summary of the facts, and indeed was,until Richard B. Spence threw a spanner in the accepted works with acontinuation of his theory that Crowley was an advancing deep-cover agent, or atleast “asset,” to obscure British intelligence requirements.Where Spence may have got his idea from, I cannot tell, but it’s ratherintriguing nonetheless. According to Spence, Edward Doheny (whom we brushed pastin chapter 2) sought oil concessions in Mexico for his Pan-American PetroleumCompany even as admiral of the British Royal Navy John Fisher (1841–1920) wasadvocating to superiors his conviction that the world’s greatest navy shouldchange over from steam to oil. Fisher believed, against the huge investmentalready made in coal-fired ships, that oil was the future. There was, however,not much of it to be had.Enter Weetman Pearson, British director of one of the world’s biggest and mostsuccessful construction companies, especially successful in Mexico. According toSpence, the same month Crowley leaves Mexico, Pearson arrives with an overridinginterest in oil concessions from Porfirio Díaz. Spence wonders if Crowley hadnot somehow smoothed the way through Masonic links (Jesús de Medina and hisScottish Rite) with Díaz, or perhaps simply through gaining useful intelligenceon what the Americans were about by earning trust, gaining confidences,listening to contacts, and keeping his ear to the ground. As Pearson wasfabulously successful from 1901, where Mexican oil was concerned, Spencespeculates that Crowley could have made himself useful at a critical time, hiscover being essentially that of eccentric British gentleman indulging a personalobsession with mountaineering, poetry, and pulchritudinous pleasure.Odd perhaps, but not entirely implausible. For a start, we do have to face thecurious fact that while Crowley’s Mexican sojourn is generally remembered forclimbing exploits with Eckenstein, Crowley had already been in the country forfive months before Eckenstein even arrived. He describes at one point in hisConfessions being so stimulated by the daily sight of the heights to beconquered that he was tempted to go mountaineering alone, but from a sense ofcomradeship with Eckenstein he waited until his friend’s arrival in Decemberbefore assaulting the peaks. It obviously will not do to say that Crowley’s solepurpose in going to Mexico was mountaineering; Crowley was a man very easilybored and frustrated.However, there are immediate problems with Spence’s hypothetical scenario, aslisted below. 1. No tangible evidence exists pointing directly to an operation of British intelligence involving Crowley. Indeed, Spence’s particular scenario is only conceivable if the hypothesis of Crowley’s “Cambridge recruitment” and supposed subsequent activity as a state-primed agent provocateur is true. That scenario remains, however, hypothetical at best. One might speculate that Crowley was executing clandestine services for Pearson alone, but you would never suppose such a possibility without prior acquaintance with Spence’s general hypothesis. 2. A detail, but not insignificant: Admiral John Fisher was not Second Sea Lord in 1900 to 1901, as Spence has him.*44 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft44] Until promotion to that position in 1902, Fisher was entitled to lobby at informal gatherings but not instigate fundamental policy.4 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt65] The head of the Naval Intelligence Department from March 20, 1899, to November 14, 1902, was Rear Admiral Reginald N. Cunstance. From March 1901, Fisher and Cunstance were opponents within infranaval politics; Cunstance was doing Fisher no favors.5 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt66] Other than Crowley’s friend Everard Feilding, who was in the Royal Naval Reserve, and possibly Captain Vincent English of the Royal Navy (retired), who captained Ashburnham’s Firefly, we do not know if Crowley enjoyed significant Royal Navy connections in 1900. Lack of such would probably have made his services unacceptable to naval intelligence in 1900 to 1901. 3. Spence supposes that a Masonic link between Don Jesús Medina and President Porfirio Díaz might have facilitated an intelligence objective. However, Methodist pastor and journalist Don Jesús had broken with Díaz’s Scottish Rite Order around 1890 to participate in a new dissident Scottish Rite body. Medina’s Rito Mexicano Reformado was opposed to Díaz’s domination of the Supreme Council of Mexico, 33rd degree, recognized by the U.S. Southern Jurisdiction of the Scottish Rite, the regular “Mother Council” assuming authority over the Rite. On the other hand, it might be argued that having formerly belonged to the U.S.-recognized Rite, the old Don Jesús would have proved an asset for gaining information on Díaz and his associates; it may, arguably, have suited Crowley to discover what Díaz’s Masonic critic was up to. A journalist with many contacts, one could speculate that Don Jesús could have been Crowley’s “fixer.” If oil was a factor, Don Jesús’s opposition to the U.S.-backed Supreme Council may also have been significant, on account of the political significance in Mexico of Masonic bodies and the president’s interest in reducing American influence if possible. Intelligence on any such connections may have been useful both to Britain and the United States, though one would have supposed an availability of other sources for information, but of course it is possible Crowley might have volunteered his findings to the allegedly constipated British consul or inebriated vice consul in Mexico City. As we shall see, Crowley’s connection with Don Jesús may have been linked to Carlist sympathies in Mexico, as much as neo-Rosicrucian magic. 4. Spence rather suggests that Weetman Pearson could have benefited from Crowley helping “Brother Díaz” to look kindly on British oil exploration in the face of American competition. Díaz, however, needed no nudging to favor British interests to the detriment of Doheny and American influence; it was his preferred policy at the time. Furthermore, Pearson already enjoyed a privileged and longstanding business accommodation with Díaz’s commercial interests.In fact Weetman Pearson was returning to Britain from Mexico in April 1901, themonth Crowley left. Habitué of Mexico since December 1889, Pearson had alreadyimpressed Díaz by installing Mexico City infrastructure, draining swamps,building a railroad, erecting powerlines, fashioning waterworks, andconstructing new harbor facilities at Vera Cruz. In 1896, Díaz requestedPearson’s help in building the Tehuantepec Railroad. As surveying progressed,obvious oil seepage on the surface became evident about Cristóbal and Pedregalsouth of Mexico City; Pearson might already have contemplated drilling toprovide motor fuel for his construction operations.In the meantime, Henry Clay Pierce’s Waters-Pierce Oil Company, an affiliate ofStandard Oil, after bringing petroleum into Mexico with an initial salesmonopoly, investigated Mexico’s oil potential. Exploration efforts came to ahead in 1901 when Edward L. Doheny established his new petroleum firm Huastecaand pushed for concessions to follow Pierce into serious drilling. AlthoughDoheny got on well with Díaz personally, the president was determined on lessU.S. dependency for his modernization program; Díaz looked to Great Britain andthe European continent.The U.S. protectorate over Cuba made Díaz particularly suspicious ofPan-American encroachment. Nevertheless, prudence dictated a position on Cubanindependence not directly antagonistic to the United States. This position maybe contrasted with Medina’s Rito Mexicano Reformado, which in July 1898, whenpresided over by Pedro Peña Romero, came out actively supporting Cubanindependence, stating, “It is argued there that the liberty of nations is afundamental principle of Freemasonry, and that the government’s officialneutrality on the issue of Cuba contrasted with public opinion ‘favorable toCuba’s independence.’”6 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt67]Díaz’s diplomatic overtures with European representatives increased after 1898.While Díaz sought alliances to challenge “Panamericanismo,” or U.S. Protestant,materialist culture, with those whose cooperation would benefit hispanismo, orSpanish, Catholic values, he could not afford to alienate U.S. investors, whoseefforts were galvanizing Mexico’s surge into modernization. Such considerationscould have been a factor in the president’s sticking with the U.S.-based versionof Scottish Rite Freemasonry, especially as he was himself head of the MexicanOrder.Pearson was in an excellent position to come out of the horn smiling. Not onlydid he have government favor, but he also had excellent local knowledge,impeccable international business experience, and an established network ofbusiness agents in Mexico.The universally accepted sequence of events that would lead in 1903 to Pearson’snetting the biggest Mexican petroleum contract in the country’s history began inApril 1901, the month Crowley departed—he crossed the Rio Grande on April 22.Pearson too was just leaving the country when a missed train connection on theTexas–Mexico border left him stranded for nine hours in Laredo. Gripped by “oilmania” since February, the town had been transformed since Captain Anthony J.Lucas’s oil strike. In the excitement, Pearson remembered the Tehuantepecrailroad surveyor’s reports and cabled his experienced Mexican manager, J. B.Brody, instructing him to secure prospecting options on all the land for milesaround the promising sites. While it took until 1908 before the first really bigoil strike, drilling progressed thereafter. By 1914, Mexico was producing 26million barrels a year, making it the world’s largest oil producer after theUnited States and Russia, with Pearson controlling 60 percent of the Mexicanmarket. Not surprisingly, Pearson was raised to the peerage as Lord Cowdray andserved as a powerful British government advisor, bringing advantageous oil dealsto the armed services.7 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt68]For anyone still seeking a place for Aleister Crowley in Pearson’s story,however minor, I can only offer two tiny snippets of circumstantial evidence offaint speculative value, though it is worth first mentioning a couple of facts.Crowley’s diary from April 22, 1900, to February 21, 1901, covering the greaterpart of his Mexican sojourn, is lost. Also, for what it’s worth, Crowley didhave some familial connection with railroads and construction. Both his fatherand his uncle Jonathan Crowley were trained civil engineers with shares in anumber of British railways, though as far as we know Crowley never exhibited anyinterest in the fact, or knowledge of the subject.One of the few fragments of Crowley’s handwriting to emerge from the Mexicansojourn during 1900 is an envelope, addressed to his friend Gerald inCamberwell, with a Mexican stamp and dated September 4, 1900. Perhaps pickingup, in Crowley’s jocular fashion, on “Don Jesús,” the letter’s recipientacquires a new identity: “Al Señor Don Geraldo Festus Kelly.” The postmark reads“Mexico D.F. [Distrito Federal = Mexico City]; Sucursal [Branch Office] B”8[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt69] Crowley’s effervescent spirit of levity wasflying high in Mexico’s crystalline air in September 1900, whatever he was upto, or for.For a couple of months, beginning February 22, 1901, we have brief diary entriesconcerning Crowley’s last Mexican adventures. It is quite something to hold thesmall, faded, but clearly legible red notebook in one’s hands and realize thatit traveled with Crowley across Mexico on horseback, by train, and on foot upactive and dormant volcanoes more than a century ago. Its opening, dedicated toQueen Isis, indicates very clearly Crowley’s priorities, as he saw them at thistime, in Mexico. He begins with a note in archaic seventeenth-century Englishasserting that he has completed his work on the rituals for the Order of L.I.L.,and that a new century has begun: a new era for humankind.I should rest awhile, before resuming my labours in the Great Work, seeing thathe who sleepeth never shall fall by the wayside and also remembering the twofoldsign: the Power of Horus: and the Power of Hoor-pa-Kraat.9[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt70]The infant Horus (the Greek Harpokrates) was traditionally depicted sucking hisfinger; this had long been misunderstood as a sign of secrecy (finger to lips)rather than of early youth, so Crowley was emphasizing discretion regardingsecrets or intent. Judging by what follows, Crowley’s idea of rest from thegreat work involved taxing, and occasionally dangerous, mountain climbing. Atender little line drawing he made of Mount Colima shows it smoking in thedistance in a deceptively lazy manner. The main work for Crowley is engagementwith spiritual powers. The mountaineering exercise is to render himself fit forthat august task, and, with Eckenstein, it was a pleasure.A fairly surprising entry occurs in Crowley’s diary for March 25, 1901. This wasduring a period following Eckenstein’s informing him that he lacked essentialpowers of concentration, a deficit that was messing up his magic, whereafter achastened Crowley began a long series of grueling concentration exercisespursued daily for many months at convenient and inconvenient times, in which hehad to hold an image or even sound or smell in his mind for as long as possible,while noting any break of attention. The entry reads: “Began recapitulatorycourse. I took a holiday.”10 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt71] First question: Aholiday from what? There is nothing in the diary to suggest that he had beenworking in the ordinary sense. And if one should think, Ah! Magicalworkings—that is to say, the concentration exercises, which were, certainly,hard work—then one must contend with the fact that they were resumed on March27, though one might argue two days’ respite was holiday enough. The“recapitulatory program” might imply reflection on what had been gained.However, the day after the “holiday” reference, Crowley noted leaving MexicoCity, where Eckenstein had been feeling ill, for Vera Cruz, whence he didn’treturn until Sunday, March 31, then, to hear the “alarming news” that “EBC”—thatis, Crowley’s somewhat dreaded mother, Emily Bertha Crowley—was “coming outhere!”Vera Cruz was of course Mexico’s main port, and Pearson’s company was rebuildingit. By 1905 it would be equipped with Pearson’s oil terminals and associatedsupport structures. Was the Vera Cruz trip a holiday—from caring for a sickEckenstein, if not the exercises, which continued at odd times in Vera Cruz—orwas it some kind of work? We do not know; it would be unwise to build much onit.Returning to Mexico City, Crowley discussed with Oscar Eckenstein news of hismother’s apparently imminent, doubtless unnerving, arrival at their billet ofpersonal liberty. Trying to concentrate on other matters, they also discussedquickly climbing Citlaltapetl, Nevado de Toluca, and Popocatapetl. Eckensteinagreed that Crowley could use his photographs of the magnificent scapes for abook Crowley planned on their climbs (this never transpired, though Eckensteinused some of them in an article about mountaineering in Mexico). They also madean arrangement for Crowley to wire Eckenstein by October 31 to confirm orabandon a plan for Eckenstein to join him on an Indian climbing expedition—whichtranspired as their famous assault on K2 in 1902.The third point of their agreement is interesting and unexpected. Havingconcurred that, with ten climbs accomplished, Eckenstein return to England aboutApril 30, Crowley would “go to Japan, Hong Kong, and Ceylon: or to Texas,dependent on the affairs of H.M. of S—”11 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt72] (myitalics). Well, we know that Crowley would go to Japan and Ceylon; but why wasthe alternative Texas?—and who was H.M. of S—? Is this an unsolved mystery, ormight it be that this has nothing whatever to do with Texas oil drilling andmuch to do with “Her Majesty of Streatham” (or even “Her Majesty of Shit”)—thatis, Crowley’s problematic mother, the bigoted Christian, as he consideredher—coming to see her relatives! Emily Bertha Crowley’s grandfather’s son fromhis first marriage, William Bishop (b. 1822), had migrated to America andmarried Mary Martin of Illinois. William was buried in Livingston County,Kentucky in 1899; his wife, Mary, likewise after she died on March 27, 1900.While EBC had clearly not been summoned to a Kentucky funeral in spring 1901,Crowley’s comments about Queen Victoria indicate that he identified his motherwith H.M. the late Queen-Empress as another hausfrau-repressed-repressor. EmilyBertha Crowley did not in fact visit her American relatives until August 1904,when the ship’s manifest gave her address as Eastbourne, not Streatham. Shevisited William’s son, Lawrence Bishop, and his wife, Birdie, in Kentucky. Whileignorance is both a fruitful, and fruitless, ground for speculation, it isWilliam Breeze’s surmise that “H.M. of S—” rather refers to “His Majesty ofSpain,” and that possibility puts us back in the territory of Crowley’sLegitimist politics, because he held Don Carlos de Bourbon to be Spain’srightful monarch.THE TWO REPUBLICSAnd so, just as astute readers may be thinking that absence of hard evidenceindicates there is little to take seriously about the Crowley-on-a-missiontheory as regards the Mexican period, there comes a remarkable discovery. I amgrateful to William Breeze for sending me something he unearthed in a copy ofEnglish-language Mexican newspaper the Two Republics, one of two papers servingMexico City’s American colony. The date (note): September 22, 1900. Below fourharrowing columns devoted to the infamous Texas hurricane that devastatedGalveston, killing around eight thousand people, the Boxer massacres ofAmericans in China, Philadelphia’s big coal strike, and to the left of a storyabout “Four Negroes Lynched” by a mob for alleged burglary at Pontchatoula,Louisiana, we find the following most curious headline and story.SAYS ENGLAND IS ON THE VERGEIsidor Achille O’Rourke, a prominent European politician, is in the city andwill remain for some months, as he says, for the purpose of spending some timein mountain climbing. Mr. O’Rourke says he has been connected with a number ofimportant political movements of Europe during the past few years and that hecame to Mexico for the purpose of seeking a quiet rest from the turmoil ofactive life.“England is on the verge of a reign of terror,” said Mr. O’Rourke last evening.“People have been denied the right of free speech in England since the openingof the Boer War. The manipulations of the British powers during the course ofthe war have been characterized by the most disgraceful actions. As an example,at the time of the alleged capture of Spion Kop by Buller, the report which wassaid to have been received at the British war office in London was nothing morethan the trumped up trick of the stock exchange to bloat the national bonds. Atthe time the message was received in London announcing the capture of Spion Kop,which was said to be the key to the situation of the war, another message wasreceived containing the news of the recapture by the Boers, but was withheld bythe war office for several days, in order that the purpose of the stock exchangemight be accomplished.“The newspapers were aware of the fact, and one well known editor told me thatit would be as much as his life was worth to allow the fact to be published inhis newspaper. The impression given out that the Boer War is settled is a farce,and simply means that parliament will be dissolved and England will sufferanother administration of the conservatives.”Mr. O’Rourke is staying at the Hotel Iturbide.And we should very much like to meet him! But who really would be attracted bysuch a tirade? First, note the name: Isidor Achille O’Rourke. The initialcapitals make an acronym—I.A.O.—which is the Gnostic name for God. God isclearly on Ireland’s side and like much, but not all, of Irish opinion, iscritical of British conduct over the Boer War and alert to war-time censorship.And should there be any doubt that Chevalier O’Rourke is Aleister Crowley, weneed only look to contemporary issues of Mexico City’s more dominantEnglish-language newspaper, the Mexican Herald, which, beginning October 14 andfor the remainder of Crowley’s stay, reported the mountaineering exploits of“everybody’s friend,”*45 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft45] Chevalier O’Rourke, and,after December, his “aide” Mr O. Eckenstein.Another surprise: Chevalier O’Rourke is staying at the Hotel Iturbide, thecity’s finest, a palatial residence still standing in its glory at 17 MaderoStreet in the city center, named after president and, briefly, emperor ofMexico, Agustín de Iturbide (1783–1824). Built 1779 to 1785 in grand style, ithad been a hotel since 1855. Crowley’s Confessions strongly suggested a briefresidency before moving to lodgings near Alameda Park, but here we find him atthe Iturbide more than three months after his arrival, apparently holding courtfor a journalist. Was he by chance leading a double life? And had the Chevaliergot over his disdain for newspapers, or was that condescension something Crowleyprojected back from the 1920s, after a decade of yellow journalism giving himtrouble?What is even more intriguing is why Mexico City citizens had had to wait untilSeptember 22, 1900, for the public manifestation of the word of “prominentEuropean politician” Chevalier Isidor Achille O’Rourke. Was he not a “chevalier”(knight) when he arrived in mid July?Well, it transpires that he was! The evidence is printed on page 2 of ThursdayJuly 12, 1900’s issue of the Mexican Herald. There, William Breeze’s penetratingeye located a tiny detail under a notice for “Today’s Arrivals—CentralPassengers”*46 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft46] indicating that “the followingpersons passed Jimulco yesterday, and will arrive in Mexico this morning.” Alongwith two named passengers from El Paso and Cleveland, respectively, the capitalcould also expect one “Isidoro Achille, Orouke, Paris.”†47[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft47]Let us look again at Crowley’s alias. We have already observed how the initialsconstitute the Gnostic name for God: “I.A.O.” The divine acronym is confirmedplainly, and obscurely, in the opening lines to Crowley’s Rosicrucian pasticheAmbrosii Magi Hortus Rosarum (“The Rose Garden of Magian Nectar,” 1902).It is fitting that I, Ambrose, called I.A.O., should set down the life of ourgreat Father (who now is not, yet whose name may never be spoken among men), inorder that the Brethren may know what journeys he undertook in pursuit of thatKnowledge whose attainment is their constant study.Ambrose comes from the Latin for “divine” or “immortal,” so that “ambrosia” isfood pertaining to the immortals, or the gods, traditionally associated with“nectar.” For Crowley, the “nectar of the gods” was the ambrosial honey ofdivine sex. Isidore means “Gift of Isis,” mother of Horus, which chimes in withCrowley’s respect for high priest and priestess Mathers’s Parisian cult of Isis,incorporated into the dedication to his recent prophecy of exile, CarmenSaeculare, from which we drew Crowley’s bold statement: “I was born Fighter.”Achilles is Homer’s Iliad warrior par excellence, and we note that the onlynonimmortal part of Achilles was his “heel” (by which water-goddess Thetis heldhim when she dipped baby Achilles into the protective waters of the River Styx),perhaps referred to in the near-acronym for “Seamus” on the cover of CarmenSaeculare (from the name “Jacob,” meaning “one who grabs at the heel,” with thepossible allusion to one who “pulls legs”). With Paris on his mind, Crowley usesthe French form, Achille. The Jacobites followed the last Stuart king ofEngland, James, to Paris, where now Mathers (seeing himself as a reincarnationof James IV of Scotland) resided. Achilles may perhaps be derived from acombination of the Greek words “achos” and “laos,” suggesting the grief of apeople, which may bring us again to the Celts, as delineated in Crowley’s songof exile, his “Song of the Sea,” Carmen Saeculare. We may also note that thearrow that hit Achilles’s vulnerable heel was shot from the bow of Paris!O’Rourke is appropriately a noble Irish surname of antiquity, a name for bravefighters, exiles and Jacobites, such as Count Owen O’Rourke, who served EmpressMaria Teresa of Austria (ca. 1760–1780), descendant of “Tigernan the Great”O’Rourke, who compounded with Queen Elizabeth I and was permitted to rule hisprincedom of Breffny and Convacny independently of English government untilCromwell’s time.As regards the title “Chevalier,” we can hardly fail to notice its consonancewith that of hero of Jacobite Freemasonry, Chevalier Ramsay (Andrew MichaelRamsay 1686–1743), whose famous “Oration” (1737), delivered in Paris, assertedfamously that Masonry derived from the knightly orders of the Middle Ages,rather than the reverse, as asserted by the pro-Hanoverian Grand Lodge ofEngland. Introduced to an enlightened Catholic mysticism by François Fénelon andMadame Guyon, Ramsay converted to the faith and entered the household of exiledStuarts in Rome. In 1723 he was knighted into the Catholic Order of St. Lazarusof Jerusalem. He was universalist in spiritual and political outlook and, beingScottish by birth, fitted Crowley’s self-mythos rather well. In his time, Pariswas the epicenter of Jacobite Masonry, actively promoting the return of theCatholic Stuart dynasty to Great Britain.Clearly, Crowley created his alias for its meaning rather than todisappear!—though it should be noted that its assumption renderedCrowley-as-Crowley quite invisible (perhaps the meaning of his claim to havewalked in Mexico City undetected in a robe of red and crown of gold) as hecombined his assumed Scottish “lairdship” with his knighthood granted in theservice of Don Carlos de Bourbon within a composite new identity, with which hehad fun.Anyone familiar with the situation surrounding Crowley’s arrival in New York onOctober 30, 1914, some three months after Britain’s entering World War I, willnote a peculiar resonance between the two arrivals. Crowley will arrive inAmerica in 1914, according to the Lusitania passenger manifest, as “Irish” fromEngland. After an initial uneasy period, he allowed himself to be identified asone in favor of revolution for a free Ireland against British rule and as asympathizer with Germany’s cause (Germany was offering Ireland independence inexchange for rebellion against England), and by the end of summer 1915 he waspenning outrageous, apparently pro-German propaganda, which close research nowrecognizes as being what Crowley afterward claimed it was: a disinformationcampaign to discredit and undermine the New York–based German propaganda aim ofkeeping the United States neutral in the war. Crowley’s campaign intended tooutrage reasonable American opinion and so encourage the U.S. government torecognize overwhelming public support for joining the Allies against KaiserBill’s Germany. We have a recent analogy to how public outrage works aspropaganda when we consider how TV images of alleged Syrian governmentatrocities against civilians in April 2017 encouraged support for militaryretaliation even among people with declared wishes to avoid confrontation withprincipal combatants.Is it possible that Crowley’s basic operational template for conduct in Americaafter 1914 was formed out of his experience in Mexico City in 1900? What couldbe the purpose of a newspaper article as provocative and apparently mendaciousas that in the Two Republics? The Battle of Spion Kop in January, for example,had involved dreadful carnage, mostly on the British side; the Boers released ahurtful, controversial propaganda photograph of young British corpses piled upand horribly mutilated in a shallow trench; Churchill had witnessed the sceneand described a notorious, merciless slaughter. A thorny question: Was“O’Rourke” aiming, through the publicity interview, at attracting personshostile to, or critical of, Britain or vice versa—or was he enjoying anelaborate ruse for other purposes, possibly even a loose-tongued anarchicoutburst or extreme, somewhat unfunny leg pull? If so, such, he knew, wouldhardly have passed unnoticed with acquaintances—or more?—at the Britishconsulate. Was he simply succumbing to the role of insane joker?It is surely significant that there is no mention whatsoever of ChevalierO’Rourke in Crowley’s Confessions, or in any other document attributed to him,though he would use Irish pseudonyms in his work for German-owned magazines inAmerica during World War I, and he found it amusing to tell his readers abouthis time as “Russian” Count Svareff in 1899. It might be borne in mind thatGermany was at this time sup-porting the Boers with arms and intelligenceagainst the British and that Germany was also trying to muscle in on British andAmerican trade and influence in Mexico and with the president personally. Oneaccusation made by German propagandists in World War I was that the war was anexcuse for Britain to keep German business out of Mexico by trying to bottle upthe German fleet.Perhaps we find a clue in Crowley’s adoption of a knighthood (chevalier) and thereference to “a number of important political movements” in Europe. Crowley’sConfessions inform us that, for services to the Carlist cause, Crowley receiveda knighthood from “one of Don Carlos’s lieutenants.” This statement carries afootnote asterisk: “There is a great deal more to this story; but I may not tellit—yet.” The word may suggests not being allowed to tell it; we can speculatethe shadow of the British Official Secrets Acts (1889, 1911), or perhaps a vowof silence. It is clear from Crowley’s writing on the subject that he took whathe considered authentic knighthood very seriously; he spent a night in a forestkeeping vigil with his arms, and he was familiar with Legitimist theoryregarding spurs being conferrable only by Legitimate sovereigns, and not bywomen.12 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt73] The account of the knighthood isseparate from the training at Ashburnham’s estate, and he gives no indication ofwhere it took place. And “Isidor,” by the way—the “Chevalier’s” Christianname—happened to be one of pre-tender Don Carlos’s middle names.Carlism was certainly a European political movement, but what had it to do withMexico?First, General Weyler, former controversial Spanish governor of Cuba, haddallied with Carlists in Spain, as we have seen, and Cuban-related politics wereof great moment to hispanismo politics in Mexico. Second, we recall the unknowncouple introduced by Legitimist conspirator Mathers to Crowley in Paris in April1900, lately returned from Mexico, to whose presence the Confessions accountattributes the idea of Crowley’s going to Mexico at all. We note that Mathershad given Crowley authority to “initiate” persons in Mexico in partibus. ThisLatin phrase is short for the Catholic episcopal phrase in partibus infidelium,meaning “in the lands of unbelievers.” The Catholic origin is significant, andthe reference in Mexico would hardly seem to apply to Roman Catholics as Mexicowas very much a land of believers, so it might best apply in the circumstanceseither to Protestants or persons outside of the Legitimist or Celtic Churchcause, for as Crowley writes in the Confessions, “The theory of the CelticChurch was that Romanism was a late heresy, or at least a schism.” This opensthe field if the “unbeliever” in the triumph of the Celtic cause was possibly anuncorrected Catholic!Now here things get even more complicated. Eighteen months before Crowley’sarrival in Mexico City, the following headline appeared on page 1 of the ChicagoDaily Tribune (Saturday, January 14, 1899).CARLISTS SEEK AID IN MEXICO: JESUITS RAISE FUNDS TO HELP THE PRETENDER’SMOVEMENT AGAINST THE PRESENT SPANISH DYNASTYThe Tribune learned from its Washington Bureau that a secret commission ofCarlists had been operating for some time in Mexico, especially among Spanishresidents. The commission traveled extensively through the country to the largercities and towns. Coming direct from Spain, they had a headquarters in MexicoCity. Subscriptions were obtained, along with assurances for more aid when theCarlist Rising got going. The pretender’s agents were largely Jesuits,Spaniards, or of Spaniard extraction. People could be reached through priests ina way they could not have been reached otherwise. They were told that they werehelping the mother country (in tune with the hispanismo tendency), that theywere helping Spanish brethren out of bad conditions and troubles brought aboutby the Spanish-American War. Many were contributing without being told that themoney was for Carlists but rather was to help Spain and her depleted treasury inits problems caused by having to fight the United States. Considerable sums werecollected, with many paying believing that they had been approached by directrepresentatives of the Spanish government.The story, though of unknown origin, may give us to suspect that there was aCarlist group operating in Mexico, even looking perhaps for a return to Catholicmonarchy in Mexico (Habsburg emperor of Mexico, Maximilian I, had been executedby President Juárez, backed by the United States, in 1867). A Carlist success inSpain would have powerful political ramifications in Mexico.The reference to the Jesuits is particularly interesting. We may recall that in1905 Crowley published his view that the Celtic Church had been revealed to himas a front for the political machinations of the Roman Catholic Church. Anunnoticed detail of Crowley’s meeting with Mathers in April 1900 may give us afurther hint. In Crowley’s unpublished document headed “Instructions fromParis,”13 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt74] he deals with the issue of the identityof a woman (“Mrs. Horos”)*48 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft48] who had approachedMathers and tricked him into believing that she was the soror “SapiensDominatibur Astris” of Nuremberg, who Golden Dawn members were given to believehad effectively chartered the Golden Dawn system from Germany in the firstplace. Crowley makes notes of magical precautions to be taken should she and hercolleague “Theo Horos” approach him, as “her forces” had been against Mathers“for long,” adding, “May be Jesuits”14 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt75] (myitalics).Complex as this picture is, it does shed light on Crowley’s relations with theold journalist he calls Don Jesús Medina “a descendant of the Great Duke[Medina-Sidonia] of Armada fame.”15 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt76] Presuming thegentleman told Crowley of his alleged aristocratic forebear, it would seemaristocracy was something they discussed, and a person keen to show such a linkwould almost certainly be someone who would view Spain’s situation with greatconcern. That does not mean that Don Jesús was sympathetic to the Carlist cause,which was traditionalist Catholic at its heart. Crowley says that he had anintroduction to Don Jesús. This may possibly have come from Mathers, most likelyif Medina had some link with the Carlist cause. However, such politicalproclivity may not be taken for granted.In December 1894, a new periodical appeared in Mexico City called El Boazeo(from the Masonic left pillar “Boaz” supporting Solomon’s Temple), subtitledImpreso Francmason, a Masonic publication. Its editor was José M. Medina(Jesús’s brother). Correspondence was to be addressed to “Jesús Medina, 1aMixcalco, Núm. 1,528” in the historic center of Mexico City. The journalsupports the “Mexican Reformed Rite” and lays out a program to “Simplify andmodify the Ancient Landmarks” of Freemasonry, to reform its constitution andliturgy, to assert the absolute independence of the first three grades ofMasonry, to include men and women in initiations, to correct philologically thewords of the grades, to support de-Catholicization of the people and the ritesof Freemasonry, and to assert the full and free broadcast of thought. All inall, a pretty radical Masonic package!image [images/9781620556313_012.jpg]Fig. 4.1. El Boazeo, magazine, run by José and Jesús Medina, for the MexicanReformed Rite of Freemasonry, 1894The “Program” is followed by a piece titled “Inquisitorial Circle” and refers toCatholic propaganda posted into the editor’s hands titled “The Inquisition.”The Catholic Circle [Circulo catolico] has published a booklet, La Inquisicion,in which the inquisition is defended. . . . One could better think of theCatholic Circle as an Inquisitorial Circle, because the church defends theinquisition, an abject tribunal which made thou-sands of victims, including manyJews, burned in “autos de fe.”During these processes sarcastically enough the Psalms of David were sung.The Catholic church is only catholic in name. The published booklet says: onlythe wicked and stupid are enemies of the inquisition, which is not true. TrueChristians and people of good will should be enemies of the inquisition. Thereal church of Jesus has its own evangelical discipline: a discipline andpunishment without the need of torture or inquisition.16[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt77]The editor plainly finds the Catholic position inhuman and completelyoutrageous. This gives us a fair view, I think, of where Don Jesús was comingfrom ideologically. Such an itinerary would not, I think, suggest one committedto a cause fostered surreptitiously by Jesuits.It is interesting that Crowley mentions absolutely nothing of this. The old manis mentioned only in terms of his role in Crowley’s magical Order of the Lamp ofInvisible Light, and Don Jesús must surely have been a very liberal Christianindeed to tolerate that. Was it all part of the story Crowley “may not tell”—andnever did? Could it even be that it was Don Jesús who enlightened Crowley to theCatholicizing implications of Carlism and the machinations in which Mathers wasinvolved? For after 1900, we hear no more of Carlism in Crowley’s life. It ispossible that he knew already, and could have been “on the case.”This interpretation of events would of course snub any suspicion that Don Jesúswas the “lieutenant of Don Carlos” who knighted Crowley. Of course if, asCrowley maintained, Medina took him through to the 33rd degree of the Scottishrite, then Medina would have “knighted” him anyhow on the way, for the 18thdegree of the rite involves becoming a “Knight of the Pelican and the Eagle,” aSovereign Prince of the Rose-Croix. This would undoubtedly have meant somethingto Crowley, who got a kick out of titles where he could. One must then wonderwho it was that Medina had been first introduced to: Crowley, or the“Chevalier,” or someone else. It would be greatly helpful if we had thepassenger manifest from the SS Pennsylvania, which had brought Crowley to NewYork. Did he come as an “Irishman,” as he would in 1914, or did he arrive underthe alias “Chevalier O’Rourke”? Sadly, that particular manifest has beendestroyed: not the only missing manifest of the period, I believe.On the basis of Medina’s journalism, it would be difficult to place the latter’sopinion of the United States. One might think he would resist too muchhispanismo, but if he was wary of American power in Cuba, as was one othermember of the Reformed Rite, he might not have been a panamericanismo supportereither (his Reformed Rite had left the U.S. Southern Jurisdiction). Perhaps,then, Medina favored British influence as a liberal mediator (the Golden Dawn’sfounders were all, incidentally, members of the United Grand Lodge of England)and would then have been most interested in Chevalier O’Rourke’s revelation ofBritish government censorship of Boer War news in London. Medina wanted aliberal, democratic politics, unhindered by the church—Masons must be “free”—andas Crowley departed from Carlist fantasies there remained in him a deep-seatedconflict in his thinking between personal freedom and orders based on theaccumulated wisdom of experience. Thelema, his eventual system, would haveelements of both principles: “thou hast no right but to do thy will” (AL I.42b);for Crowley, that reconciled free will and destiny.And if we put aside for a moment the possibility that Chevalier O’Rourke wassimply an anarchic figment of Crowley’s urge to make mischief and pull legs, oreven that Crowley really was a pro-Irish revolution advocate with persisting, ifconfused, Carlist commitments, there exists the following possibility.If we allow any substance at all to Spence’s theory that Crowley’s covert motivein getting tight with Mathers was to sniff out Carlist and related subversiveactivity, then Medina could well have proved a most useful contact, because hehad considerable journalistic experience of both Catholic propaganda and secretsocieties in Mexico and would have been the first to be disturbed at news ofJesuit-inspired attempts to manipulate Mexican Catholics into supporting adestabilizing Carlist rising in Spain. However, any thought that Medina was somekind of Masonic conduit to Díaz must be dispensed with. Don Jesús was ferventlyanti-Díaz, and opposition was doubtless mutual.What is remarkable perhaps is that Spence’s hunch of a Crowley intelligence rolein Mexico preceded the discovery of Chevalier O’Rourke’s extraordinary interviewwith the Two Republics. Spence’s hypothesis that the nexus of Crowley’s allegedintelligence role was in facilitating Pearson’s British oil business may havebeen beside the point, though the stability of Díaz’s regime was surelyadvantageous both to Pearson and to British and American political andcommercial interests.Another consideration: in answer to the reasonable objection that Crowleyhimself never directly implied any such role in his autobiographical writings,we ought to remember that had Crowley not been outraged at being accused ofbeing a traitor to his country in World War I by yellow journalist HoratioBottomley in January 1920, he would never have written his apologia (“The LastStraw”) outlining his disinformation activities at all, and we might have takenthe “traitor” story from the mouth of the gutter press. But even then, Crowleydeclined to publish in 1920, probably over issues of secrecy. Only limitedreferences to the content of “The Last Straw” appeared in P. R. Stephensen’sdefense of Crowley’s reputation, The Legend of Aleister Crowley, in 1930, andeven this publication enjoyed limited circulation in Crowley’s lifetime.*49[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft49]Crowley knew how to keep a secret."},{"pageContent":"FIVEimage [images/9781620556313_099.jpg]Chevalier O’Rourke and The Mexican HeraldFor a man who claimed he would not sully his hands with a common newspaper,Crowley, as Chevalier O’Rourke, had a remarkable relationship with what hadbecome the leading paper for Mexico’s expat American business community, theMexican Herald.1 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt78] Owner Paul Hudson’s goodrelations with Díaz ensured that the paper became something of an intermediarybetween Díaz’s regime and the U.S. government. The editorial policy wasPan-American, integrating Mexico into the community of peaceful nations, with avision of a technologically inspired future of modernity.According to Joshua Salyer’s enlightening study of the Herald, its editorstended to different degrees to emphasize the benefits of U.S. business modelsand Pan-American policy to the detriment, where politic, of what it assertedwere the antimodernist tendencies of European “imperialists.”2[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt79] Hudson would have to moderate his editorialposition when Díaz spoke up for Spain at the outbreak of the Spanish-AmericanWar in 1898. On this ground alone, one can see why the paper would take aninterest in Isidor Achille O’Rourke’s claimed status as a politician involved inEuropean political movements, whose exertions in that regard had brought him toMexico, albeit as a respite from them.It is clear the Mexican Herald editors had read the story that appeared in theTwo Republics, the Herald ’s chief, if lesser rival, and decided to investigate.The paper then reported, even trivialized, the Chevalier’s exploits asadventures in daring and eccentric humor. The Mexican Herald, noticeably, didnot report on the Chevalier’s political views, only on his vacation adventures,sometimes in an overfamiliar, patronizing, skeptical light. By 1900 even themainstream American press was debating America’s own “imperialism,” a situationthat encouraged British and European commercial interests even further in Díaz’sdeliberations. We should therefore not take at face value the Mexican Herald ’shandling of O’Rourke and his so-called aide, railway engineer and mountaineerOscar Eckenstein.image [images/9781620556313_013.jpg]Fig. 5.1. Oscar Eckenstein (1859–1921)The Chevalier’s first notice in the Mexican Herald (October 14, 1900) indicateshow much time Crowley had been spending with gamblers, while apparently givingthe lie to his statement in the Confessions that he held off thoughts of actualclimbing until Eckenstein arrived. The note at the end, that the secretary ofthe U.S. legation had already climbed Ixtaccihuatl, is typical of the paper’spolicy: an American official had already trumped even the skill of the Briton!A Herald reporter called on the Chevalier O’Rourke yesterday in regard to thereport that he was going to attempt the ascent of Ixtaccihuatl.The Chevalier said that he had climbed many mountains in Switzerland that hadbeen pronounced inaccessible and that guides could not be procured to make theattempt. He is confident that he can reach the summit of Ixtaccihuatl butprefers to have a companion go with him and if any one should doubt hissincerity or judgement in the matter he is willing to make the following betviz: $1,500 to $1,200 that he will take any healthy American or Englishman tothe summit of Ixtaccihuatl within 21 hours of pitching the camp at or near thesnow line. The following conditions to be observed:1st. Each party to provide his personal equipment, such as guns, horses, etc.2nd. The taker of the odds to provide the common equipment as tents, mules,provisions, service, etc.3rd. The layer of the bet to have absolute command in all questions appertainingto mountain craft.4th. Serious illness of either party after reaching the snowline to cancel thebet (this will not include the so-called mountain sickness).5th. Stakes to be held by a responsible party to be subsequently agreed upon.6th. In the event of a fatal accident to either party, the whole of the stakemoney to go to some charitable object to be agreed upon.7th. The taker of the odds to have the right of stepping first upon the actualsummit.8th. Each party to exercise separately the right of making literary use of theexpedition. Or, Chevalier O’Rourke is willing to make the attempt with a suitable companion,without the bet, the balance of the above conditions to be observed, and hethinks the honor of being the first to climb the mountain will more thancounterbalance the expense which will not exceed $200 each.Any gentleman who wishes to accept either of the above propositions cancommunicate with the Chevalier O’Rourke at the Hotel Iturbide.Chevalier O’Rourke has been in Mexico City about four months and with atraveller’s instinct has learned the lay of the valley pretty thoroughly. Itwill be interesting to watch if there are any takers for the above rather uniquewager.Note: Ixtaccihuatl has been climbed by Henry Remsen Whitehouse, at one timesecretary of the United States legation here and some others.Ixtaccihuatl would not be climbed by Crowley until January 1901, afterEckenstein’s arrival from England, shortly before Christmas.Brought up in London’s East End, the son of a German Jewish socialist andEnglish mother, Oscar Johannes Ludwig Eckenstein (1859–1921) was one of the fewmen Crowley truly respected, notwithstanding a manner that could intimidate bysimple, plain speaking and sharp eyes. Crowley knew Eckenstein’s reputation inthe sport had suffered from anti-Semitic jealousy and other causes. The unsunginventor of the crampon and a number of other revolutionary innovations,Eckenstein incurred the Alpine Club’s disdain by applying science to the sportand by dismissing recommendations regarding guides, ropes, and othersafety-first measures that inhibited genius on the rocks. Eckenstein believedthat climbers should be self-reliant, honing their wits and acquiring skillthrough facing difficulties head on. One club member called Eckenstein “a dirtyEast End Jew” in Crowley’s hearing after a climb in Zermatt, Switzerland.According to fellow mountaineer Guy Knowles, it was Martin Conway, president ofthe Alpine Club in 1902, who probably obstructed Eckenstein’s climb of K2 withCrowley (Eckenstein was briefly detained from entering Kashmir by India’sviceroy) because Eckenstein had fallen out with Conway and quit Conway’sexploration of the Karakorams in 1892.3 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt80]image [images/9781620556313_014.jpg]Fig. 5.2. K2 (Chogo Ri) base camp on the Baltoro Glacier, Karakorams, 1902.Crowley seated (right of center); mountaineer Guy Knowles, standing right.The first thing Eckenstein told Crowley when he arrived in Mexico was thatCrowley was failing in his life and his magic—an activity Eckensteindismissed—through inability to concentrate properly. Crowley took the advice ascoming from the highest source and proceeded to engage in grueling dailyexercises that stood him in good stead for the rest of his career.At one point in the Mexican Confessions narrative, Crowley refers to the two ofthem “falling in” with a group of railway engineers.4[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt81] This may not have been accidental. Eckenstein waswell qualified to work for Pearson, or for the Mexican Central Railroad, or anysimilar body, for he was a railway engineer “years ahead of the times in thoughtand scientific invention of devices for the betterment of railroading,”according to fellow engineer Bostonian H. W. Hillhouse of the InternationalRailway Congress Association. Hillhouse met Eckenstein at a congress held in theUnited States and spoke of Eckenstein’s serious interest in Easternphilosophies, and in mental telepathy, as well as his uttering frequentanti-British sentiments.5 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt82]Constantly smoking Rutter’s Mitcham shag, as was his habit, Eckenstein wasprobably at Crowley’s side when, according to the Mexican Herald of December 27,a Mr. and Mrs. J. S. Bowdle of Denver interviewed prospective mountaineers toaccompany them on an ascent of Popocatapetl, or “Old Popo” as the journalistfamiliarly dubbed it. Chevalier O’Rourke, “everybody’s friend,” took jocularcontrol of the conversation, according to the journalist, who perhaps preserveda true dialogue, offering a glimpse of Crowley’s habitual good humor.“It’s mountain climbing you’re after, is it?” said the chevalier when he hadreached the presence of Mr. Bowdle.“That was my object in coming to Mexico at this time,” replied Mr. Bowdle. “Areyou fond of climbing?”“Very. I have climbed everything from a four board fence to a grenzel pole, andwas never curried below the knees,” gallantly responded the chevalier. “Thereare a great many things to be considered when contemplating a trip up a greasedpole or a snowy mountain,” he continued, “the first and most important of whichis, whether the return trip will ever be recorded. I am looking for a man whowill consent to remain with me at the top of Popocatepetl providing we find thelocation a pleasant place to live.”“Yes,” said Mr. Bowdle, “I understand there is a growing sentiment in the Cityof Mexico in favor of a number of people locating in the crater.”“Quite possible,” assented the chevalier. “I have been encouraged by a greatmany people in my ambition to prove that a person may as easily die from theeffects of a sun stroke at the top of PoPo as yield up the ghost from mountaintroubles when living on the level with the sea. The latter I have provedconclusively. I have demonstrated, to the delight and astonishment of a largenumber of friends, every symptom of mountain troubles while on the sea, and amprepared to test the sunstroke idea at the highest elevation within the reach ofman.”“Is there any danger in climbing PoPo?” inquired Mr. Bowdle from his newacquaintance.“No more than stumbling over an empty tomato can in your back yard,” was thecheerful commonplace reply. “There is pre-eminently more danger in extractingthe essence from a boisterous and irreligious heifer. I am a living example.”“If such is the case I agree with you, but do you wish to accompany our party?”“I go where glory waits me.”Glory awaited elsewhere. Eckenstein and Crowley undertook the 17,343-foot ascentof Ixtaccihuatl, where he and his friend, having completed the climb, exercisedthemselves by practicing sharpshooting with revolvers and rifles in the clearair, to great effect: something they repeated whenever near a strange settlementas a means of deterring the commonplace murderousness of Mexican marauders.On February 2, 1901, nine days after the death of Queen Victoria, news thatbrought the climbers joyous relief, the Herald ’s headline Bold Alpine Climberannounced the pair’s achievement.Chevalier O’Rourke, the famous Alpine rover, returned to the city Thursday. Withhim he brings a fortnight’s growth of whiskers, his mountain climbing companion,O. Eckenstein, and a bunch of secret information about their flirtation with“The White Lady” (Ixtaccihuatl), which has already aroused the envy and jealousyof those who have gone before, but not so far, into the graces of the famous oldwoman.The chevalier is a clip [hit?], and with his aide-de-camp, Eckenstein, they haveexplored the snowy bosom of the hitherto unattainable lady to further orders.They discovered that the topmost point of her classic bust moved their aneroid[barometer] to announce the height at 17,343 feet. This enviable familiaritywith the White Lady was reached by a perilous exertion on the north side of hersleeping apartment, and the chevalier describes it as being very difficult ofapproach owing to the steep powdery snow. This bit of information regarding thevanity of the Lady who until now had never been known to use such an article ofartistic adornment as powder, is, according to the gallant chevalier, a delicatesubject, which he unwillingly makes public, at the same time considering it oftoo much importance to withhold.The Lady entertained them in one of her choicest apartments in a camp at 13,800feet, where the chevalier says they were attacked by nothing except dyspepsiaand cold feet. The furnaces have not been in working order with the White Ladyfor a great many years, but otherwise her reception was of the most cordialnature. On the North peak they spent some time at an altitude of 16,882 feetwhich the Lady assured them had never before been trodden by mortal man. In thisparticular the chevalier and his distinguished friend were allowed privilegesabout the dominion which they highly esteem.At another time the Lady entertained Mr. Eckenstein, unaccompanied, in herfavorite drawing room where the apartment, Mr. Eckenstein asserts, is furnishedwith a group of rock towers, the highest of which was exceedingly difficult ofexploration.“Our visit was deucedly uneventful,” said the Chevalier last evening. “The WhiteLady received us royally. She abhors animal life which is entirely extinct inall her possessions. She eats very little, since she is a confirmed sleeper; andwe were compelled to subsist upon canned goods which I think have come from whatwas left of the embalmed beef which was fed to the American soldiers. I and myfellowman have both a beastly attack of dyspepsia.”Mr. O’Rourke added that it was not definitely decided just where their nextexploration would take them. He aspires to scale the Mount of Orizaba before heforsakes the country, and his friends all bid him Godspeed. He related a numberof his experiences last evening in the American club, where he is a provisionalmember.Three weeks later Crowley and Eckenstein were at the Hotel Cosmopolita (stillstanding), Guadalajara, a handsome city in Jalisco State, some 280 milesnorthwest by train from Mexico City and about 62 miles north of the live volcanoof Nevado Colima, their destination. It was there that Crowley “completed thework of L.I.L.,” an achievement he considered crowned the previoustwo-and-a-half years of magical efforts.On February 27 they took the train 50 miles south to Huescalapa, whence the nextday they rode to a ranch, then on March 1 to camp at 12,550 feet. Crowley’snotebook contains a drawing of the smoking volcano “from the camp”: an awesomesight. On March 2, Crowley made a different kind of journey, much less tiring:an astral journey to Elaine Simpson Witkowski (by arrangement), who was livingin Hong Kong with her husband, a German investment banker.The next day Crowley and Eckenstein made an “early start for Nevado,” Mexico’sonly active volcano. The lower slopes were thick with enormous trees, then pinetrees until about 13,000 feet, after which, no trees at all: lava scree, rocks,and what climbers of the period called “bread-crust bombs” blown out by thevolcano in semifluid state before hardening in the sun. Crowley’s diary recordsthe denouement, after the uncomfortable, deeply tiring journey: “Returned at3PM.”6 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt83] The mountaineers had had to contend withthe Colima volcano spewing forth burning ash, and the climb was called off whenthe red-hot ash burned into their shoes and penetrated their shirts. Colimawould erupt with full force in 1903, changing the slopes again after the 1869eruption, on whose lava flow Eckenstein and Crowley had tried to ascend. Itmight be noted that Crowley’s diary for these months only contains details ofhis image-concentration exercises; nothing is said of what filled the days,other than mentions of travel on horseback south of Guadalajara.On March 19 the Mexican Herald recorded the sense of disappointment felt by theclimbers.A HARD PROPOSITIONMountain Climbers Unable to Ascend the Slopes of ColimaChevalier O’Rourke and his fellow mountain climber, Mr. Eckstein [sic], returnedyesterday from Colima where they have been for the past weeks examining theactive volcanoes of that Pacific state. The chevalier for the first time in hislife found something which he could not climb. The volcano of Colima is adecidedly hard proposition. The chevalier and his companion nearly lost theirlives in their attempts to ascend the active mount. “Large cinders and asheswere thrown into the air for several miles,” said the climbers last evening.“When we were ten miles from the crater we were pelted with bits of cinder allof which satisfied us that the earth’s internal fires have not subsided to anygreat extent.”On April 3, the Herald reported that Chevalier O’Rourke “and his aideEckenstein” were leaving that day for Orizaba or Citlaltepetl (18,491 feet),accompanied by John Benjamin Marshall, manager of the International StenographicBureau, native of Kentucky, and a keen climber. According to a 1908 U.S. articlein Outing magazine by Edmund Otis Hovey, “The ascent of Orizaba, the highestmountain on the continent south of Alaska [in fact third highest], is rarelyundertaken on account of the lack of accommodations for tourists.”7[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt84] Kindred difficulties would be encountered by theChevalier and his fellows.*50 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft50]Shortly before they left, the Herald announced on March 31 the arrival ofvacationers who identified themselves as A. Roosevelt, son of New York and Parisbanker Cornelius Roosevelt and cousin of “the hero of San Juan Hill,” now U.S.vice president, with companions Dr. Charles Thoan of Paris’s Hotel Dieuhospital, and millionaire “sugar king” of France, H. Say. They announced theirimminent ascent of Popocatapetl as part of scientific studies led by Thoan totest blood pressure at altitudes. “Mexico is beautiful,” said the cadetRoosevelt, “but her grub is tough.” Crowley might have agreed; he was constantlysuffering from sickness due to poor-quality canned food. Clearly the reporterasked if they knew of the Chevalier and his companion. The paper printed thevisitors’ reaction.Dr. Thoan is a member of the celebrated Alpine Climbing society in France anddiscredits the claim of Chevalier O’Rourke, to being a member in good standingof this distinguished society. The chevalier and his aide Eckstein [sic] bothhave said they were Alpinere, but now come these gentlemen with the unmistakableaccent and with no Bally Bay apostrophes chopped into their names, denying ourfriends their thunder with painful positiveness.Readers may note the somewhat unpleasant comparison of value made between goldenrich kid Roosevelt and the Irish “Bally Bay” surname O’Rourke. This is ablue-blood Republican newspaper!Anyhow, cut to April 4 when young Roosevelt and pals return from Popocatapetl.The lad says he can’t recall what happened on the mountain as he passed out andthat it was a mistake to climb a mountain without long acclimatization, onaccount of the air. “I’m glad to get away from Mexico. I believe I would die inthis country,” cried the young varsity heman, celebrated for fitness anddemocratic directness by the Herald only four days earlier! Dr. Thoan indicatedthat he would not be returning. They left for Los Angeles by Mexican CentralRailroad, just in time to miss the return of Crowley and company on April 6.ASCENT IMPOSSIBLEHoly Week Not Favorable to Mountain Climbing in MexicoThe Chevalier O’Rourke, Mr. Eckenstein, and Mr. Marshall, returned yesterdayfrom Oriziba where they had gone for the purpose of making the ascent of MountOriziba but for various reasons they were unable to accomplish their purpose. Onaccount of holy week, guides were not obtainable and other obstacles arose whichcould not be overcome.Crowley does not refer to the trip in his diary at all, other than, on March 31,the intention to climb it. Between April 3 and 4 his diary merely records ajourney to and from San Andrès Cholula, southeast of Mexico City, which was some43 miles west of Citlaltepetl, though the latter mountain could be seen fromthere, as could Popacatapetl to the west.On April 7 an article in the Herald indicated that Crowley and Eckenstein hadvented spleen over the paper’s reportage of Roosevelt and friends, and perhapsfor failure to climb the highest mountain in Mexico, by threatening the paperwith legal action. Meanwhile, Crowley did a tarot divination that day to helphim decide where next to go. Indications for Japan were “awful” if he went atonce. “Therefore I decide absolutely to postpone this journey, and am stronglyinclined to go to Canada.”8 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt85] He was minded to goto Canada because he’d received a letter from friendly contact, great Britishmountaineer and former tutor in chemistry J. Norman Collie, with a map of theRockies and the latter’s recommendations. The negative tarot divination woulddetermine Crowley’s eventual decision to stagger his trip to Japan by stayinglonger than expected in Hawaii in May and June. Again, it must be stressed thatCrowley’s movements were dictated by personal, practical, and spiritualconsiderations; this would have made any kind of strict intelligence itinerary,governed by human beings remote from himself, unlikely.In the meantime, Eckenstein decided to get even with the Herald journalist.OFFENDED CLIMBERSThink Their AchievementsHave Not Been Properly TreatedThe Chevalier O’Rourke and his friend Mr. Eckenstein are said to be taking legaladvice in this city with a view to prosecuting the Herald because of the allegedliberties which this paper has taken with the names of those persons. Mr.Roosevelt, of New York, who recently visited here, stated that the mountainclimbers O’Rourke and Eckenstein were not members of any climbing society thathe knew anything about, and the gentlemen are said to have taken exception tothe remark. Mr. Eckenstein also asserts that he is no “aide” to O’Rourke, andO’Rourke thinks he never needed an aide. The chevalier has written a number ofbooks, some of which are very good and others have never been reviewed. His namewhen he is an author is Aleister Crowley. He is a shadow of Swinburne.According to the Confessions Eckenstein met the offending journalist in his “lowbar” and scared the bejesus out of him while Crowley jocularly encouraged thefellow to join him on a trip to Popocatapetl to confirm the journalist’s beliefthat mountaineering was really quite easy. The chap would be all right as they’drope him to them, and all he’d have to do was to keep up: nothing too desperate!Crowley and Eckenstein then took a quick train trip 22 miles south-west ofMexico City to Calimaya, then went by horseback 9 miles to the volcano of Nevadode Toluca. Eckenstein fell ill after they climbed the lower peak; the higherpeak Crowley climbed alone the next day on April 11.On April 16 the Herald reported the men’s plan to ascend Popocatapetl anddescend into the crater without ropes. That same day Crowley astral traveled “inan egg of white light” to see Elaine Witkowski by prior appointment in HongKong. She was standing in a room of white and pale green, wearing a white dresswith velvet lapels. He tried to lift a cloisonné vase from shelf to table with“questionable success.” He said, “Vale Soror!” (“Goodbye Sister,” of the Order),he thought, audibly. That was at 10:00 p.m., after spending the day travelingdown to the fertile, crop-filled plain of Amecameca, which provides aspectacular view of godlike Popocatapetl. On March 17 the party spent the nightat the ranch (hotel) at Tlamacaz and ascended Popocatapetl at great speed onApril 18.As Crowley says in his Confessions, the journalist learned a hard and sharplesson. Roped securely to an absurdly cheerful Crowley and Eckenstein, chivvyinghim on with gleeful encouragement, the utterly exhausted American cursedeverything he could think of but had no choice but to stumble unwillingly on.Crowley remarked that the journalist wrote up an account of his experience ofthe climb in the Herald in the style of “Dooley,” an Irish character. Itappeared in the Herald on April 21. This little extract gives an idea of it.“How are yez, Hinnessey, me b’y,” said Mr. Dooley as he came up the streetwalking by the assistance of a cane.“Foiner ’n silk,” replied Hinnessey, “but why the stick; is it lame yez are?”“Spake in whispers er not at all, an’ oi’ll be tellin’ ye, fer as me ould frind,oi belave ye’ll not bethray me. Oive ben away t’ th’ top iv Popeycapethel . . .”“But, Mr. Dooley . . .”“Hinnessey, be thrue to me. Me woife hez denied me bid an’ bard, an’ oim a poroutchast in the worruld, charged with havin’ no sinse at all. Oi wint,Hinnessey, in the inthrusts iv Seance, wid me former counthrymon, the ShivvyleerO’Rourke, an’ his parthner-in-crime, Barron von Eckenstein. Kape away from him,Hinnessey, er ye’ll be inveigle into some desperate skame be th’ which ye’ll berobbed iv yure bodily comfort an’ fam’ly this. Th’re a bloomin’ pair iv humandayceivers who cahnt till th’ diff’rence betwane hate and co’ld, upon me soulth’ cahn’t.”By the time it was published, Crowley was heading for El Paso, leaving the Texasborder town for San Francisco on April 24, the day this fascinating—and somewhatmore respectful—story appeared in the Mexican Herald.CLIMBER TO LEAVEMr. Eckenstein May Explore the Wilds of Canada and AlaskaO. Eckenstein, the British mountain-climber, who has been in this country forthe past few months in company with the Chevalier O’Rourke, expects to leavetonight for Veracruz where he will sail on the Ward line tomorrow for New YorkCity.Mr. Eckenstein will join a friend in New York [almost certainly J. Norman Collie1859–1942] and they may decide to make a journey into the unexplored regions ofCanada and Alaska. Mr. Eckenstein, when busy, is a civil engineer.Mr. Eckenstein is an Englishman by birth, but his parents are German. When ayoung man he attended the University of Bonn at Germany having as one of hiscollege mates, the present emperor of Germany. Mr. Eckenstein said that in hisyounger days Emperor William was a very unpretentious fellow and one would notsuppose from his actions and mode of living that he was to become ruler of agreat country. He was of a strictly democratic temperament, said Mr. Eckenstein,and was a thorough student in school who was generally admired by all his fellowstudents. In speaking of the sensational reports printed concerning the Kaiser’sstate of mind, Mr. Eckenstein is inclined to scoff. He said:“I find that people are unable any longer to appreciate an honest statesman. Inalmost every nation under the sun and particularly in America, the politiciansare subject to the influence of the rich. Other parts of the world are similarlyaffected. In Germany they have a ruler who says just what he thinks under allcircumstances and he is sincere in what he says; so the people of the world arepleased to call him crazy, or suffering from incipient insanity. On the contrarythe emperor is intensely sane. He believes in honesty and uprightness and squareand open dealing with his people under all conditions and he tells them hisideas and his intentions.”Mr. Eckenstein is at present spending a few months vacation after a long periodof engineering service and he was attracted to Mexico by the Chevalier with whomhe had wandered over a great deal of the earth’s surface.O’Rourke, who is a wealthy Scotch-Irishman, owning vast estates in differentparts of the old country, will stay in Mexico until further orders.Mexico would never see the Chevalier O’Rourke or Baron von Eckenstein everagain. One wonders if they were missed, and if so, by whom.Was Crowley a secret agent in Mexico?Assessing Spence’s theory regarding Crowley’s alleged employment as a Britishgovernment agent undermining Legitimist politics, and even facilitating oildeals with the Mexican government, two possibilities present themselves.Crowley’s Legitimism, while sincere, also offered access to secret informationof interest to Britain’s secret services, and he may then have played a role inMexico on behalf of those services. The second possibility is that he wasengaged at some level in covert Legitimist activity, to which he was, at leastinitially, committed, in a manner indifferent to British government interests.Regarding the first possibility, it ought to come as no surprise that there isbound to be a level of intelligence activity regarding which regularintelligence officers may be uninformed, and while such suppositions may inviteridicule as mere fuel for fictional fantasies, who could seriously deny theusefulness to power of such undertakings? Crowley could keep a secret. He couldalso keep his word of loyalty, to the highest cause of which he was aware. Inrespect of which, it is significant that when in May 1891 a teenage Crowleyentered Malvern College, Worcestershire, and joined the Cadet Corps of the 1stWorcestershire Royal Artillery Volunteers, he made an oath of loyalty to theBritish crown. Curiously deleted by editors John Symonds and Kenneth Grant fromtheir published version of Crowley’s Confessions, Crowley’s original accountshows that despite fierce criticisms of much of British government and society,Crowley always recalled his first oath of loyalty to the crown: “every time Iperform an act in support of my original oath, I strengthen the link [toEngland].”9 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt86]He made other oaths too. On March 17, 1900, he had formulated an oath regardingthe Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin, submitting himself “utterly to the Will of theDivine.”To despise utterly the things and the opinions of this world lest they hinder mein doing this.To use my powers only to the Spiritual Well-being of all with whom I may bebrought into contact.To give no place to evil: and to make eternal war against the Forces of Evil:even until they be redeemed unto the Light.To conquer the temptations.To banish the illusions.To put my whole trust in the Only and Omnipotent Lord God: as it is written“Blessed are they that put their trust in Him.”To uplift the Cross of Sacrifice and Suffering: and to cause my Light to shinebefore men that they may glorify my Father which is in Heaven.10[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt87]The whole tenor of Crowley’s comments on the subject of loyalty are consistentfrom the time of the outbreak of World War I to the end of his life; that is,that while he maintained a position as an abrasive, unsparing and propheticcritic of what he regarded as the follies of his country, he was essentially andinstinctively loyal to Britain and strove for her ultimate welfare. One suspectsthis position arose out of earlier conflicts in his mind, and it would appearthat his experience in Mexico was determinative in this regard.Crowley in 1900 may have been involved with some sort of covert activity inMexico, but in a manner indifferent to British government interest. It ispossible that as a “bigoted Legitimist,” as he described himself with hindsight,he was in 1900 to 1901 still operating in loose association with Mathers and hisLegitimist colleagues’ dream of a Legitimist revolution in Spain and elsewhere(despite that dream’s dismal failure in 1899), though it must also be said thatthe possibility of a Crowley engaged in Legitimist politics does not necessarilypreclude the other possibility, that he also felt called to serve aparadoxically superior service.Until we are graced with hard evidence for Spence’s hypothesis of Crowley’semployment as a pro-government agent insinuating himself into Legitimistpolitics, my own conclusion must be that Crowley went to Mexico initially withsome matter in mind related to Mathers’s Legitimist activities. The idea ofgoing had, he stated in Confessions, occurred to him only after meetingcolleagues of Mathers’s in Paris, just returned from Mexico. Once in Mexico, andacquainted with the facts on the ground, I suggest his thinking on the subject,and his attitude to Mathers himself, evolved significantly, quite possibly afterdiscussing hard realities with Medina, who could easily have shown him what wasinvolved in terms of Legitimist usefulness to Catholic political intentions. Isuspect Medina either positively or negatively assisted Crowley to “see thelight” on this matter and remove from his eyes some of the scales of hishistorical romanticism. Crowley’s subsequent activities suggest strongly adetermination to eschew politics and to explore more deeply magic (includingBuddhism and raja yoga with Allan Bennett), poetry, and mountaineering asprincipal lines of activity. As far as fading enthusiasm for Legitimism goes,one discerns signs of a young romantic giving all for the “impossible dream,”only to see the raw windmills behind the dream. Crowley-Quixote was an“impossible dream” kind of person, which explains something of his attraction,but the world is a cold knife, and heaven, warm flesh.“Explain me the riddle of this man.” Indeed."},{"pageContent":"SIXThe Mother’s Tragedy HERE, in the home of a friend,Here, in the mists of a lie,The pageant moves on to the desolate endUnder a sultry sky.Noon is upon us, and Night,Spreading her wings unto flight,Visits the lands that lie far in the West,Where the bright East is at peace on her breast:Opposite quarters unite.Soon is the nightfall of Destiny here;Nature’s must pass as her hour is gone by.Only another than she is too near,Gloom in the sky.THE SPIRIT OF TRAGEDY’S OPENING LINES;THE MOTHER’S TRAGEDY, 1899After a depressing experience of brutish materialism in vice-ridden El Paso,followed by a casual act of grisly mutilation in Juarez across the Rio Grande,Aleister Crowley climbed aboard the Southern Pacific Railroad train at El Pasostation, Texas, on April 24, 1900. Bound north-west for California, thelocomotive roared and puffed its way across the Texas border into New Mexico,then on through Arizona and California for a day before reaching apiston-screeching halt at San Francisco station at Townsend Street and 3rd.Pale as a hacienda, the colonial station with its graceful, roomy arches, andcupolas looked back to the West Coast’s Spanish past. Crowley probably didn’ttake it in properly. Suffering from a bad cold and acute stomachache, close tovomiting all day, he twice resorted to an opium grain for relief. The dust andheat of the long journey had got to him, probably the food too.Judging by Thursday’s edition of the San Francisco Call, Crowley arrived to finda city agog over the imminent arrival of President McKinley and his wife. Amidscenes of wild enthusiasm, America’s first couple toured a visibly gratefulcountry. The Call announced with something akin to reverence that the presidenthad chosen to reside in friend Henry T. Scott’s house in the city, on the cornerof Clay and Laguna Streets, for six days in May, during which time San Franciscowould be the effective seat of American government: a moment in Frisco’s historyso proudly anticipated that the Southern Pacific was cutting ticket prices tohelp people come into the city from out-lying areas to witness the celebrations.It all resembled a gilded epiphany of royalty. Typically, Crowley did not regardthe fervor worth mentioning: all so swiftly passing, headlines trodden in thepuddles of time.Apart from the paper’s doubtless staggering news that women from the OhioSociety were planning a banquet for the visitors, the other headline of theday—Terror Holds Full Sway in Cape Colony—exclaimed an unlikely story that theBritish could lose South Africa because of draconian arrests and allegedintimidation of Dutch settlers, with four Cape Colony newspaper editors beingarrested and a campaign of espionage and internment camps with families guardedby armed troops under military justice. The report somewhat echoed ChevalierO’Rourke’s apparently prophetic assessment of “terror” in the previousSeptember’s Two Republics in Mexico. Meanwhile, the Cuban ConstitutionalConvention requested a reluctant U.S. administration to grant the island itsindependence.When Crowley returned to San Francisco in 1915 he noted how much he missed thevivid character and multifarious architecture of the pre-earthquake city, but athis first visit he felt unimpressed by its whirl of pleasure seeking and“frenzied money-making.” Indeed, San Francisco in 1901 must have been fairlytraumatic after the laid-back tempo of Mexico under the “Porfiriato.”A stroll or streetcar ride northeast up old Market Street from its intersectionat Hyde, Grove, and 8th Streets would eventually have taken him past the newlyconstructed Call Building: no straight-up, break-your-neck-to-see-the-top, steeland glass shard this, but a stately “skyscraper” of pride and shapeliness—thetallest office building in the west, as luxuriantly apportioned as a dowager ata deb’s ball. New buildings of commanding size were well into construction amidthe plethora of four-story Victorian shops and offices in brick, wood, andstone.As the cable car trundled steadily past the awnings to the right of the EmporiumDepartment store—a mecca for ladies in long, dark dresses, buttoned to thechin—the view up the very straight and very wide street was yanked intoperspective by the tall, thin tower of the Ferry Building, a guiding sentinel orpharos in central vision at the far end of a sea of crisscrossing traffic, itshuge clock reminding everyone that time is money and that Market Street, likeeverything else, had a definitive, unavoidable end. A scattering of the latestmotorcars wove and chugged their way in the sun around pedestrians andtramlines, impertinently overtaking horse-drawn carts and city water wagonsunhindered by traffic restrictions, even U-turning in the middle of the bustlingstreet as men in bowlers and dark suits took their chances dodging theever-moving surge of a street scored with tram rails, horses’ hooves, andgrinding wooden wheels. And behind it all, the wheels of fortune, of fortunesmade and lost every hour, ticking away in tune with the Ferry Building’s clockand the port’s swift exchange of Pacific stock.Crowley made his way to his favorite part of San Francisco—Chinatown—where thesolitary traveler lit joss sticks in “their temple,” and had his fortune read by“Wong Gong.” Crowley dutifully noted Wong’s prognostication in his red Mexicannotebook purchased from Al Libro Mayor (“The Ledger”), owned by Swiss editor,printer, and picture-postcard maker, Juan Kaiser Schwab (1858–1916), San LuisPotosi 16. But for the business stamp in the notebook we should never havesuspected Crowley ever visited San Luis Potosi, north of Guanajuato Province.What past and future did Gong perceive and foresee?Good family.Quick learner.Only one or two brothers and sisters [Crowley had a sister who died in infancy].From 1 to 5 all right.5 to 10 sickness.10 to 15 good studies.15–17 much loved by girl.15–20 everything very good.20–25 great aunt died.Age right.I make much and spend much money.Everything all right.25, 26, 27 be careful.28 change till 34 I marry.35 to 40 all right make much money.41–60 best time in my life. Very happy &c.61–67 all right.68 bad obstacle to pass but if I do, live to 75.3 kids only once married. Rich wife.Better luck in 1st 6 months of year & in 7th 15 days of month. Lots of goodfriends.1 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt88]Not bad, Wong, but wrong after 35. What the oracle did not impart was that theprevious month city doctors had detected bubonic plague in Chinatown, which theauthorities refused to do anything about; a quarantine, it was whispered, woulddamage trade: plague only killed people, after all, and mostly Chinamen. Despiteunknowingly gambling with his life, and seeing some unpleasant sights—the corpseof a cocaine addict turned his stomach—Crowley felt drawn to the old Chinatownand its inhabitants, which was fortunate as he was heading toward theirhomelands.I realized instantly their [the Chinese] spiritual superiority to theAnglo-Saxon, and my own deep-seated affinity to their point of view. TheChinaman is not obsessed by the delusion that the profits and pleasures of lifeare really valuable. A man must really be a very dull brute if, attaining allhis ambition, he finds satisfaction. The Eastern, from Lao Tsu and the Buddha toZoroaster and Ecclesiastes, feels in his very bones the futility of earthlyexistence. It is the first postulate of his philosophy.2[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt89]It would be interesting to voice that view in Chinatown today.Crowley stayed in San Francisco at the Palace Hotel for nine days, during whichtime he began his epic poem, Orpheus. As he wrote, he became aware how much hisideas had changed and were still changing on many fronts. Among these changes wemay include his attitude toward Legitimist politics.image [images/9781620556313_016.jpg]Fig. 6.1. The Palace Hotel, San Francisco, circa 1880On April 26, Crowley wrote on Palace Hotel stationery to Gerard Kelly in anecstasy of feverish composition, heightened by his solitariness on the Pacific’scusp:Dear Gerald,I am Aleister Crowley c/o Arnhold & Karberg, Hong Kong, China [he would pick upGerald’s reply there].*51 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft51] I am going to writeOrpheus to be all lyrics.You wait!

You wait. I’m mad with delight.4[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt91]On Monday April 29, Crowley awoke to widespread storms. The Call reported that“farmers rejoice over goodly rain,” which dampened nobody’s enthusiasm, for Mr.and Mrs. McKinley were in the best of health. Little did McKinley know, amid thehysteria of admirers, that he had only four more months to live before fatefulassassination brought grief to a poorly Mrs. McKinley and shock to a bereavednation.The next day, Crowley was still hard at his new epic poem, writing ecstaticallyto Kelly on Palace Hotel notepaper.I’ve written 80 pages of Orpheus. All lyrics all Nature. Some is I know good. Ihave written very fast: most difficult metres—double rhymes and four or fivewords rhyming and that sort of thing. I never seem to hesitate. On Sunday I wasa nervous wreck.Comic opera (sure the mark!) cured me. . . .I have bought a most marvelous ivory Buddha am sitting before it now withjoss-sticks burning. . . .Going to McGovern-Gardner fight tonight and sail for Sandwich Islands [oldBritish name for Hawaii] Friday. Christ! I wish you were here.5[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt92]The above letter was undated, but we can date it precisely because Crowleyinforms his distant friend that he’s off to see the “McGovern-Gardner fighttonight.” This was the biggest contest in America that night of Tuesday, April30, 1901. The pugilists’ struggle was announced thus on April 25 in theIndianapolis Journal:Unscrupulous managers and fighters have done much recently to bring pugilisminto bad repute with the public. There is more money in the business forfighters who are on the square than for men who engage in fake contests, but thelatter class kill the sport. McGovern’s coming fight in San Francisco willdetermine whether the sport is dead or alive on the Pacific coast. Should therebe the least sign of a fake about the bout it is very probable that boxingcontests will be a thing of the past in that part of the country, but shouldMcGovern prove that it had nothing to do with Gans laying down in Chicago andput up a fast exhibition in San Francisco the sport will be revived.6[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt93]“Terrible Terry” McGovern had fought Oscar Gardner on March 9, 1900, but theresult was disputed, leading to the San Francisco rematch at the MechanicsPavilion, a massive indoor arena known as the “Madison Square Garden of theWest” built in brick in 1882 to seat nearly eleven thousand on Larkin, Grove,Polk, and Hayes Streets, lost to fire in 1906. The fight had come to SanFrancisco because the State of New York had temporarily banned professionalprizefights: this fact alone would have ensured Crowley’s presence; he hatedprohibitions. Above an oval photographic portrait of mustachioed referee HarryCorbett, wearing a smart, fabric-rich suit and cravat, the San Francisco Callheadline warmed up readers for the Main Event.HARRY CORBETT IS SELECTED TO REFEREE THE BIG BATTLETerry McGovern and Oscar Gardner Are in Fine Fettle and Ready for Their FisticEngagement This Evening—The Boxers Meet Before the Camera and Exchange Warm andHearty GreetingsMcGovern made the first lead: “Hello, Oscar,” he said.—Gardner came back withthe same greeting and the honors were easy.“I never saw you looking so fine, Oscar,” said Terry with a side step thatbrought him closer to Gardner. They both led with their rights and warmly shookhands. In reply to Gardner’s polite query about his health, McGovern said he was“finer than silk.”Both donned ring costumes and took up fighting positions before the camera.—Theyeyed each other narrowly and chaffed each other somewhat, but withheld fightingfor another time.Gardner and McGovern later called on the club’s physician, Dr. W. C.Fidenmuller, and underwent a physical examination. Both men were found to be insplendid fettle and capable of making a fast battle.The following is what Crowley saw that night, according to Charles “Charley”White’s article on Wednesday, May 1, in the San Francisco Call.As the bell sounds both men spring to the center of the ring. Without a moment’shesitation McGovern lets fly with left, right, and left on head and face.Gardner covers himself and backs away. McGovern is anxious. They clinch andGardner lands three lefts on body. They break cautiously. McGovern lands leftand right on face. McGovern cops a short left on Gardner’s jaw. Terry is veryeager and lands a brace of lefts and rights on jaw and nearly drops Gardner.McGovern is too anxious, and misses left swing. He then lands hard right onbody. Terry lands left and right on head. Gardner places two lefts on body, butMcGovern’s attack is not stayed. McGovern tries to catch Gardner on jaw in thebreakaway. Terry hits Gardner on jaw and turns him over. Gardner rises and Terryis after him like a demon, but is fighting wild. Gardner is dropped again, butis soon up and Terry is wildly anxious to finish him. Gardner hits low and Terrysays, “Oscar, you’re hitting low,” and Gardner answers, “I did not mean it.”Terry appears anxious to finish his man and lands a blow on the head that turnsGardner completely around. Terry is fighting very wild. He lands a hard straightleft on Gardner’s body as round ends. McGovern is fighting as he alwaysfights—anxious to finish his man as quickly as possible. He is the perfect typeof a fighting machine, combining qualities of quickness in the style of heavyartillery. He is a little anxious to commence proceedings. Gardner simply wasthe receiver general, displaying splendid gameness. Round Two . . .Terry hooks right on jaw and follows up with a brace of rights knocking Gardnerthrough the ropes. Gardner turns a complete somersault in his journey. He ishelped back into the ring. Gardner is taking a severe beating. McGovern isfighting carefully. The bell sounds, otherwise Oscar would have been out. Terrygoes back to his corner confident while Gardner shows signs of the severepunishment he has undergone. Oscar’s training is standing him in good stead.Round Four. Terry is first up. He lands left on stomach and sends right to head.Terry smothers Gardner’s wild swings. Terry plants a hard left on stomach. Terryputs right on jaw and knocks Gardner backward. Terry follows up quickly andsends hard left to stomach and whips in right on face and Gardner falls. GeorgeHarting, the official timekeeper, counts ten, and Gardner is out, but RefereeCorbett makes a mistake, and does not declare Terry the winner. Oscar risesagain and is helped to his feet. He is sent down a moment later and while on hisknees, Terry sends a left that brushes Oscar’s hair. There are cries of foulfrom the spectators, but no foul has been committed. Terry smiles and shakesOscar’s head. Gardner is up again and they are again at it. Terry wants to endit here but swings wildly. Gardner lands a good right, but Terry is not to bedeterred. He watches his chance and puts a terrible right on body and Gardnerdrops to the floor a beaten man. The time of round is 2:35. Gardner is unable torise and his seconds fan him while he is lying on the ground. The body blowshurt him.With Gardner knocked out in four rounds, Terrible Terry had done it again andretained his featherweight title.While Frisco’s fight fans took in the news, Crowley added a few lines to hisletter to Kelly of the previous day.Lyric mine seems played out now. Anyway today I am doing none. Write me A.Crowley c/o Arnhold & Karberg, Hong Kong, China.Ever,Aleister Crowley7 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt94]Perhaps the previous night’s fight had knocked the lyric flight out of him.Boxing and poetry don’t mix.image [images/img_002.jpg]Hawaii was next on Crowley’s agenda. There were natives in Hawaii who would notmourn McKinley’s death, for Hawaii in 1901 was far from becoming America’sfiftieth state. Newly dubbed the “Territory of Hawaii,” the islands had beenillegally annexed as such by the United States in 1898 with McKinley’s support,against native wishes. The natives and their rightful monarchs had over thecentury seen their population dwindle from imported diseases while the generalpopulation was artificially expanded by foreign plantation owners’ importationof cheap labor from the Far East and Puerto Rico. There was plenteous bitternessamong native Hawaiians, and among other inhabitants of the islands bound tosweated labor.At San Francisco’s bristling port, Crowley inspected steamship Nippon Maru,bound for Honolulu on Friday, May 3, a cargo liner that had first attracted theSan Francisco Call ’s attention on January 15, 1899: “New Japanese steamerNippon Maru in port.” Owned by the Toyo Kisen Kaisha (Oriental Steamboat Co.),she had arrived the previous day on her initial voyage. Like sister shipsAmerican Maru and Kongkong Maru, she was “not a very handsome boat,” but herofficers told the paper that she was “fast and very comfortable.” In supremecommand was Captain F. R. Evans, and under him served three European and threeJapanese officers. While the ship went into commission in England, Japanese lawinsisted that its officers hold a Japanese certificate, which Englishmencouldn’t take; hence Japanese officers were added to the crew. Heavilysubsidized by the Japanese government, the Nippon Maru was run in conjunctionwith vessels of the Pacific Mail and O & O companies. She brought up sixty cabinand eleven second-class passengers, “besides 19 Japs and 17 Chinese in thesteerage.”Four days into the voyage, oblivious apparently to all but his increasinglysuccessful concentration exercises, Crowley “went to Devachan.” TheosophicalSociety founder Madame Blavatsky informs us that Devachan means the “dwelling ofthe Gods.” Crowley recorded curious astral visions, perhaps assisted by opium,though he does not record such. His imagination encountered a world of “pearlylustre,” with trees of “superbest plumage” and bright birds. “Saw sea-captain onhis ship, lover contemplating bridge, etc. The Real inhabitants were as if offlame; the imaginary ones appeared physical. Saw mountaineer, etc. My fatherpreaching; with me in his old home; my mother, etc. Saw a man doing raja-yoga onwhite god-form.” Crowley had been reading The Astral Plane, Its Scenery,Inhabitants and Phenomena, written in 1894 by C. W. Leadbeater, then secretaryof the London Lodge of the Theosophical Society. In that book the authorreferred to the work on Earth of what he called the “Life Wave.” Crowley wrotein his diary, “The Wave (see Leadbeater) was of pale light of rather silkytexture. It passed through and over me. One of the habitants passed through me,unconscious of me.”8 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt95]Back on planet Earth, the Nippon Maru docked at Honolulu two days later. Thepast eighteen months had seen dramatic events in Hawaii’s new era of U.S.control. Indeed, the very ship that hosted Crowley’s astral travel had been anunwitting instigator of tragedy. The Nippon Maru had brought bubonic plague fromChina to Honolulu in late 1899. Plague spread through Honolulu’s Chinatown. IfCrowley had thoughts he could pursue his admiration of things Chinese there, hewould not find much left to explore.The administration attempted to control the plague by burning selected houses inthe area, by renovating sewers, and by putting the Nippon Maru’s sister shipAmerica Maru into costly quarantine, for fear it carried rats, but in January1900 one of the induced fires whipped out of control when high winds carried theflames to “clean” buildings. A mighty conflagration engulfed Chinatown forseventeen days, destroying thirty-eight acres as selected burnings at thirty-oneother Chinatown sites continued. Seven thousand homeless people were crammedinto detention camps and quarantined until April 30; forty died of plague.Crowley arrived only a year after the quarantine’s end.Crowley did not observe anything untoward. All he had to record was a localpaper’s announcement of a “White Lotus Day” to commemorate a decade since HelenaPetrovna Blavatsky’s death on May 8, 1891. Crowley determined to visit localTheosophists during his twenty-seven days in Honolulu. He must by now havecaught the paper-reading habit, despite risks to his intellect.On May 10 he moved into the Hawaiian Hotel Annex on Waikiki Beach, whosebrooding volcanic past inspired him to poetry. He considered imitating Gauguin’strip to Tahiti a decade earlier—that is, to find himself a hut and a girl andcommit himself to art—but while he felt fired up for art, much of his romanticdreams were swiftly swept up into an interest in a “pretty widow or divorceewith kid.” She was Alice Rogers, née Mary Alice Beaton, and she came with herthirteen-year-old son, Blaine Rogers. Of Scottish descent, she had left herhusband at home in Salt Lake City and was in Hawaii to recover from hay fever.Crowley was smitten, but not so much as to lessen his commitment toconcentration exercises and “physical astral projection,” a technique forconscious astral projection while in asana, taught to him by his closestcolleague in the Golden Dawn, Allan Bennett, at that time studying Buddhism andraja yoga in Ceylon.On May 12, Crowley practiced magical ceremony in his hotel room at his shrinewith its ivory Buddha bought in San Francisco, making the comment, “I aminclined to believe in drugs—if one only knew the right drug!” He was thinkingof the age-old magical requirement to “loosen the girders of the soul” so thatinvocations could focus sufficient inner force. He recalled the cocaine corpsein San Francisco with a cold shudder he would eventually get over, to hisdetriment. He devoted himself to all the occult studies relevant to his grade inthe Golden Dawn, Adeptus Minor, including adopting god-forms as a way ofchanneling spiritual energies for conscious application in willed outcomes.Wednesday, May 22, marked Aleister’s first kiss with Alice. They cuddled. Hetold her that he loved her and kissed her. The kiss was returned; the affairbegan. He tried to persuade her to come with him to Japan. She agreed, andchanged her mind. But Crowley booked her passage anyway, and she changed hermind again.On June 1, Crowley reread Esoteric Buddhism (1883) by Blavatsky’s colleague A.P. Sinnett (perhaps borrowed from Honolulu’s Theosophists), while Aliceattempted to avoid full sex with Crowley, claiming she had uterine cancer. Thenext day she confessed that she’d been lying about the cancer and agreed to goto Japan. Part of Crowley was surely in a romantic swoon, but as ever there wasanother part, quite ruthless about such things: “I was a silly shit not to fuckher Monday, quarrel and part,” he confided charmlessly to his diary on June 4.9[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt96] But in his own way, he loved her, and that meantlust had to be satisfied so they could get to the higher aspect of the feeling.One might think that in Crowley’s haste to see Mrs. Rogers alone and withoutclothing that he took no notice of her son, Blaine (one wonders what became ofhim). It took some twelve years before his mother’s seducer’s thoughts aboutBlaine found literary expression in a controversial critique titled “Art inAmerica” published in the English Review in November 1913, a work to which weshall return in due course. Fortunately for the lad, he was not named, asCrowley used him, outrageously, as a means of assessing the education “common”to American youths and its inadequacy for preparing the mind for creating art ofthe first rank.I once talked with a boy of thirteen years old [Blaine Rogers], as bright andintelligent as I ever met. He knew no Latin or any modern language; he did notknow where Berlin was; he knew the names of only eight of the States in his owncountry, although he was getting “a quarter” for every one he could name; heknew no arithmetic beyond the first four rules, and those he knew badly; hishistory was confined to George Washington and [American statesman] James G.Blaine, to the exclusion of such insignificant characters as Napoleon; and hisother mental bunkers were equally empty of coal. He had excellent machinery;nothing for it to work with.Now, one might expect a boy of this type—a type almost universal in America—todevelop into an artist. He lived in Salt Lake City, but spent most of his yearin California and Honolulu. Having nothing else to feed on, one would expect himto feed on his surroundings; and I cannot conceive of anything much moresublime. The Mormon adventure is one of the most romantic in the world’shistory; the ghastly grandeur of Utah is an epitome of death as Oahu and theGolden Gate are of life. The finest island in the world; the third finestharbour in the world; the most wonderful valley in the world; and the mostadmirable climate in the world; one of the most intoxicatingly variedpopulations in the world—what comes of it?Wednesday, June 5, found the randy English poet, taken-by-storm Alice, andhapless son Blaine at the port at Honolulu. Before them was docked the SSAmerica Maru,*52 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft52] Yokohama bound, or as Crowley’sdiary put it, “Started with Alice for Hell.”10 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt97]image [images/img_002.jpg]Everybody plays a role in the great drama of life. Crowley saw Mary’s role asthe muse for his sometimes witty and effective, bittersweet sonnet cycle, Alice:An Adultery (1903), which covers in almost documentary fashion each day of theaffair to its wizened end: “Thank God I’m finished with that foolishness!”Marcel Schwob considered it a “little masterpiece.” One feels Crowley wentthrough the lows and highs specifically with a work of art in mind, and Alicehad more reality for him as poetry than flesh, for Crowley has put the soul oftheir lightning love adventure into rhyme. This tendency of Crowley as artistand magician would intensify in time to become a full-blown way of perceivinglife, especially in the United States from 1914 to 1919. Crowley pursues humansymbols on a metaphysical journey. Not surprising that he will come to think ofhis American years as a “dream,” and he and reality somehow lost in it, forevery significant person he met there was treated as a symbol, masked by aspecific mythical role. Little wonder Crowley felt so often adrift on the sea ofsoul, which is where we must leave him for the time being as he sails out ofAmerican territory to the East in quest of fresh experience.Still, if we are to entertain the hypothesis that Crowley’s extraordinary forayinto the Far East launched in the Americas was, even in part, some kind ofdirected “intelligence mission” we must consider strong indications in hispersonal letters to Gerald Kelly that the adventures of 1900 to 1902 could, andperhaps should, all have gone differently. This is not a skein of feelingdiscernible in Crowley’s Confessions, which are predominantly assertive andseldom admit weakness or sentiment, being the Olympian product of middle age, athousand disappointments, frustrations, persecution, and battle-hardened steelof purpose.Aged twenty-five, Crowley wrote to Kelly from Yokohama about his affair with“Mary Beaton.” He debated with himself whether it was really a good idea to goto Ceylon to put himself under friend Allan Bennett’s tutelage in raja yoga, foruntil then he had been his “own master.”Shall go as far as Colombo [Ceylon, where he would meet Allan at the end of July1901]. There I am not my own master for a while. Maybe I shall come practicallyright through to London. Quien sabe? [“Who knows?”] It depends on occultconsiderations, or climbing considerations, or on poetry considerations. . . .You will not recognize my mind when I get back. I am very calm and happy andfairly energetic all at the same time.11 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt98]From Yokohama, Crowley sailed to Shanghai, then Hong Kong, only to find thatElaine née Simpson, now Witkowski, his old comrade, had just had a baby and wasembroiled in ordinary colonial life. Elaine had apparently worn her GD robes ata fancy-dress ball, a sort of blasphemy for Crowley. He felt alone in hispersonal quest, so hurried to Colombo to a man equally alone. To improve AllanBennett’s fragile health, Crowley suggested that they go higher up, to abungalow called Marlborough, above Kandy. There, amid the sun-kissed, humidhills, the men pursued the most demanding, assiduous exercises and experimentsin raja yoga trance in a Buddhist philosophical framework. For all that—andCrowley achieved much—he wrote to Kelly, on August 2, 1901, a letter permeatedby bittersweetness about the whole effort of “exile,” now into its second year.You say [C. S.] Jones told you “my news between Cambridge and Mexico.” You don’tsay how fully. I was a fool to go; but glad I went [my italics]. . . .The Cosmic Fuck! (This is a new invention of mine, which would take too long toexplain. [He is referring to Orpheus again.] The drama of MEDEA is played byrequest of Eurydice as a warning to Orpheus if he screws elsewhere. [Crowley putan entire play—The Argonauts—within his overkilled verse epic, Orpheus!]12[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt99]Nor did the mood pass. Kelly received another letter from Kandy where Crowleyseemed to regret or half regret what he was doing. The strain was beginning totell. “What a fool I was not to come home instead of this maniac jaunt. ‘Excuseme, sir, I think I’m going mad.’”13 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt100]POST SCRIPT: THE LAST LAUGHThe Mother’s Tragedy that gives this chapter its title is certainly not that ofAlice Mary Rogers. She escaped the mystical adventure and went safely back homefrom Japan to her ordinary earthbound comforts and contented (perhaps)historical obscurity as, to all socially required appearances, fine wife andmother, a lady to her fingertips. No, The Mother’s Tragedy is perhaps not atragedy at all but rather a leg-pull at the expense of those who thought theyhad Crowley over a barrel of their own corrupt and cocksure self-assurance.History has conceivably waited more than a century for this joke to becomevisible. Now it can be told.In his surviving “Writings of Truth” record, written in Kandy, Crowley made asingle entry for August 18, 1901: “By concentrating the mind on any point of thebody, a throbbing becomes evident in that part. This even in a mathematicallyformed point whose very name one is ignorant of.”14[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt101]As Crowley wrote that entry, a story appeared on another side of the world, inthe Mexican Herald, a paper you may recall that found the Chevalier O’Rourkesomething of a challenge, concluding that the sporting thing was to sport withhim. In the Chevalier’s now four-month absence, one of its journalists clearlyimagined a fine opportunity had come the paper’s way both to “out” the Chevalierand to get its own back, with little fear of contradiction. His snappy littlestory purports to be a review of Crowley’s very interesting poetic drama, TheMother’s Tragedy (1899).*53 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft53]AN AWFUL BOOKThe Noted Chevalier O’Rourke Out-Swinburnes SwinburneWhen the Chevalier O’Rourke was in Mexico we thought him Awfully Simple; now hehas written a Poem which shows he is Simple Awful. So is the Poem. It is soMorally Unhealthy that it had to be quarantined on the Way to the land of theAztecs: and of so Burning a Nature that the Covers are of Asbestos, and itCarries a Fire Insurance Policy. It is a Book which no Self Respecting Girlwould permit her Mother to read: and One which few real Respectable men wouldpermit themselves to Overlook.The Chevalier O’Rourke is the Stage Name of the English Importation who answeredto the Cognomen of Aleister Crowley in the Home of Shamrock II, and who firstStampeded the public of San Francisco Lane [the church of San Francisco, likethe Hotel Iturbide, is in Madero Street, Mexico City] by his InimitableCombination of Knickerbockers, Long Hair, and Inseparable Pipe, and a generalBug-House Make-up. His After-Celebrity came when, with an Alpenstock and his manFriday Eckenstein, he trampled the snowy Breast of Ixtaccihuatl, and chewed bitsof the Alabaster Neck of the White Lady, to Quench his Burning Thirst.Previous to That he had Prolonged the Horrors of the Spanish-AmericanPleasantness by a Book of Greeting to the New Republic, which has since Beenequaled in its effect only by the long Drought in the Corn Belt and the SteelStrike. But his latest Riot of Rhyme has the War Production Beat a Mile, andThen Some, with the Decameron of Bocaccio Away Back in the Ruck, and EllaWheeler Wilcox on ice among the Also Rans. It is so bad that the Author isafraid to Read it Again, lest he be corrupted. In short, it is Destined to beAmong the Most Popular Books of the Season.The Effervescence is Called “The Mother’s Tragedy and Other Poems.” The “andOther Poems” belong just a block beyond where the trolley stops for “Mother’sTragedy” in Spotted Town. The Chevalier Evidently becomes Intoxicated with theExuberance of his own Verbosity and seeks to Give Artistic Versimilitude to anotherwise Bald and Unconvincing Narrative. He gets There on All Fours with theVerisimilitude, even if the Art is lacking. “And Other Poems” made the Book soBad that the Chevalier had to Print it Privately, and the Name of the Printer isas completely Lost as Teddy Roosevelt.Dr. A. W. Parsons [a recent 33° in the Díaz-led Ancient and Accepted Rite] isamong those in the city who believed in the literary ability of the Chevalier,and to him the author has sent a copy of his book. The doctor compares thegeneral work of the Chevalier to that of the poet Swinburne, for in his bettermoods he has brought out some of the sweetest songs of love and nature, but hislast production seems in a class of badness by itself.“The Mother’s Tragedy” is the story of an illegitimate son who has been rearedin ignorance of the identity of his parents.In time he falls in love with his own mother, whose fondness for her sonrestrains her from telling him the degrading story of his birth, and he forcesthe conclusion by a proposal of marriage to his mother. He raves in scenes ofbeautiful depths of love when she in agony refuses his suit. She is finallycompelled to reveal the awful truth to her son to prevent his self-destruction.The denouement is heart-rending.Dr. Parsons, remember, was the “live wire” who was running the appendectomy scamwith his pal from the home country. One suspects that Crowley surmised the good(?) doctor would not keep to himself the revelation that the Chevalier, late ofthe Iturbide, was an English poet and would present his findings to thefast-talkin’, wise-crackin’, chip-on-the-shoulder, slave-to-capital smartasshack at the Mexican Herald.That the vulgar attack on Crowley’s verses was unmerited—even if he wrote ithimself—we may take as read. Crowley introduced the drama with an explanationwhose irony has entirely passed by the anything-for-a-buck mentality of thejournalist. The story concerns the workings of Fate, which must reach, in thiscase, their tragic end, regardless of what Crowley calls the “dodges” men try tohide behind, of prayer and false pieties, professions of Christian innocence,professed indifference, or wishful thinking. Conduct yourself in a particularway and the result, however long it takes, will surely transpire.In the case of the story, we have a mother, Cora, who earns her living from lowprostitution and low entertainment, cash conscious and con-science free. Shefinds herself pregnant and bears the consequences. Ulric is born, and she loveshim passionately, so passionately that she will not compromise their growingcloseness by letting him know that she is his mother. Maturing, Ulric finds anice girl, or shy maid if you like, called Madeline. The mother observes and isglad. Her son will be happy, but she will not lose him; Madeline is an innocent.The day comes for the mother to congratulate the son; but no, the son isoutraged. Marry a girl! Never; he loves a woman: Cora. Cora is devastated. Shesays it cannot be. Why? Ulric demands. She says to explain will destroyeverything. How dare she destroy their love! Ulric squeals. He forces her totell him the truth. He loses his mind, dragging his mother off to have his way.He returns to find Madeline, the purity of innocence, lost. As the “Spirit ofTragedy” watches over all, Ulric kills her, and having killed her, before hismother, cuts his own throat. The mother is left, alone, abject. The Spirit ofTragedy broods eternally.The point is simple and awe-full. The journalist thought he was clever,disclosing the truth of Crowley’s identity. But in the process, in the heat ofhis passion and mindless confidence, he has only revealed himself as the son ofprostitution: a money-muddled whore, destined for oblivion. This is perhapsCrowley’s subtle, spiritually power-packed last laugh on the venal qualities ofthe American gamblers and culture of avarice that had laid its eggs in MexicoCity, the city of the eagle and the snake. The eagle had flown, but the snakeremained, forever shedding its skin. The “Mexican Herald” was the herald not ofMexicans—a “brave and buoyant people,” as Crowley called them—but of corruption.Dr. Parsons had failed his medical. Fate is inexorable, and claiming God is onone’s side means nothing. As Crowley’s dear father, Edward, used to say, “Getright with God.” Ignoring this is the Mother’s Tragedy. Where is Pan-Americanismnow?"},{"pageContent":"SEVENimage [images/9781620556313_099.jpg]Return to New York 1906We left Aleister Crowley in the summer of 1901, his mind stimulated by love,raja yoga, and the works of Theosophists C. W. Leadbeater and A. P. Sinnett,about to undertake a journey across India that would take him to the Karakorams,and the tempests of K2. Crossing India in 1901 to 1902 brought Crowley toprofound awareness of the quality of fatality in Nature.Lines of fate are generally only drawn “after the event,” but whether or not wesee them, or trace them accurately, they are there. There is a line of fate thatjoins a certain young woman to Aleister Crowley. I should like, as we go, topoint out some moments when this line, or fuse, becomes, in retrospect, visible,before reaching its explosive denouement.In the year 1906, at the age of twenty-seven, the very remarkable Jeanne RobertFoster (1879–1970) formally joined the Theosophical Society in New York City, aplace she frequently visited for work assignments. Otherwise, she resided inRochester with her considerably older husband, insurance executive MatlackFoster. Pastor’s son Foster was twenty-three years his wife’s senior. Jeanne wasseventeen when marriage opened the door to a life free of financial struggle.Determined to work, she took advantage of Matlack’s patronage by studying for abusiness diploma from Rochester’s Athenaeum and Mechanics Institute. Before hermarriage, Jeanne had worked as a teenage teacher in the Adirondacks where manyof her boy pupils were taller than her!Born Julia Elizabeth Oliver in Johnsburg, New York, eldest of four children ofAdirondack lumberjack Frank and schoolteacher Lizzie Oliver, “Jeanne RobertFoster” (her pen name) was raised in the hard, penurious environment of theAdirondack Mountains, northeast upstate New York, west of Vermont. Difficult,sometimes harsh times were ameliorated by a loving family, outstandingcharacters among the ordinary population, by folktales, songs, and by plenty ofrich, if often strenuous, contacts with nature in the densely wooded vicinity ofGlens Falls and Chestertown. A photograph of Jeanne, aged eight, immediatelyevokes antique, sepia-toned daguerrotypes of steely, careworn pioneers headingwest, but while the girl is dressed simply in gingham shirt and smock and givesout a don’t-mess-with-me toughness, the wide eyes, mouth, full lips, and broadforehead already betoken Jeanne’s innate intelligence, drive, and theextraordinary beauty that would be hers in maturity.In 1900, Jeanne played minor roles for the American Stock Company at 8th and42nd Streets, New York, staying, at Matlack’s insistence, at the Saratoga SacredHeart Dominican Convent. The year 1900 also brought a lucky meeting with VanityFair editor David Dodge, who insisted Jeanne’s beauty grace the magazine asmodel “Jean Elspeth” in the Christmas issue. From then on, modeling offersflowed in colorful abundance from the top magazines. In 1903 she became the“Harrison Fisher Girl,” after respected glamour photographer Harrison Fisherseized on her potential to attract business and inspire him. While Fisher guidedher through the pitfalls of the job, Jeanne liked the way he portrayed her as anactive, can-do-anything kind of girl, refreshing and positive, open to newexperience. She put her good money to good use, purchasing a home for herparents in Schenectady, while trading on her mass of red and gold hair andstunning Grecian profile: an immensely comfortable sexiness.image [images/9781620556313_017.jpg]Fig. 7.1.

Jeanne Robert Foster, acting and modelingStarring roles at the Madison Square Theatre followed enrollment at theStanhope-Wheatcraft Dramatic School, but this failed to satisfy Jeanne’sambition. Having learned to type, she worked as assistant to Miss Grace Gould,fashion editor for the William Randolph Hearst papers, then started attendingcourses at Harvard and Boston University extension schools. In biographerRichard Londraville’s words, “She was simply too beautiful, too talented, andtoo ambitious for an elderly husband to keep reined in.”1[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt102]Jeanne had the good fortune to attend lectures by Charles Townsend Copeland,George Santayana, Josiah Royce, Herbert Palmer, and William James, the latter apsychologist and philosopher of whom Crowley would write in his article “Art inAmerica” in 1912, “William James is the only name [among American philosophers]that occurs to me with anything like a feeling of respect.”2[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt103] Like Jeanne, Crowley was greatly impressed byJames’s Varieties of Religious Experience (1902).Boston captured Jeanne’s heart; she would stay there from 1905 until 1910. Shewrote for Boston and New York papers, took college courses, and undertookoccasional modeling assignments. Despite the glamour, Jeanne held fast to aninner conviction that spiritual life was the primary reality, and messages couldcome from above, in curious events and unexpected meetings; her world was fullof symbols.In an interview with Aline Saarinen in 1962, Jeanne related how spiritualteachings unleashed her from a Calvinist heritage. “I escaped set religiousbelief at fourteen. My father was one of the trustees of a prominent church, anda deacon, but my mother had at first followed the transcendentalists and laterbecame immersed in the cosmography of the Vedantists whose system is a part ofthe Indian gospels.”3 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt104] Jeanne, like her mother,became friends with Vedantist disciples and met the remarkable Indian mysticSwami Vivekananda (1863–1902), with whose work Crowley was also familiar andwhose teachings Jeanne endeavored to follow. It was a Vedantic traditionasserted by Vivekananda that great souls may sometimes be reincarnated ingroups, thus creating spiritual movements with mutual support. According toRichard Londraville, Jeanne thought in her old age that she had been fortunateto have grown into the midst of a group of great minds and great personalities.She wrote in a letter to Aline Saarinen, “I came to accept reincarnation astruth and—as life went on and the mountain girl met—seemingly through specialdispensation—great men and women, and when life gave me opportunities I couldnot have earned in this life, I felt that I had returned to that group.”4[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt105]Aleister Crowley was returning from a breathtaking walk across southern Chinawith his family when it was decided that his wife, Rose, and baby daughter,Lilith, should return westward via the Suez Canal, while he, after revisitingold friend Elaine Witkowski in Shanghai, would take a ship east across thePacific for Vancouver, cross North America, then sail back to England from NewYork. Aleister and Rose had a peculiar marriage.Jeanne Foster was probably in Boston when thirty-year-old Crowley boarded RMSEmpress of India at Shanghai Harbor on April 21, 1906. Built sixteen yearspreviously in Barrow in England’s northeast, and run by the Canadian PacificSteamship Company, the Empress weighed 5,905 tons and accommodated seven hundredpassengers on the Hong Kong– Shanghai–Nagasaki–Kobe–Yokohama–Vancouver route.Had Crowley been an ordinary man you might think that his diary contained atleast a note about life on board, or even the odd reminiscence of the last timehe docked at Yokohama, with Alice Mary Rogers and son in 1901, but no, to judgefrom his 1906 diary you would never even know Crowley had left his bed inShanghai all the way to Liverpool, where he would disembark on June 2.Practically every single entry right across the Pacific, across Canada, down toNew York, and onward concerns the quality of his attempts daily to invoke the“Augoeides,” or dawning light, the Holy Guardian Angel, the divine being, as thecompletion (still to be achieved) of the Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin the Mage,first attempted in 1899.Fortunately, Crowley gives us some idea of his time in America in 1906 in hisConfessions, where he recalls that he had by a few minutes just missed buyingthe last ticket to San Francisco via Honolulu. This he regretted, not onlybecause he wanted to bathe once more in the beauty of the islands but alsobecause that ship, four days later, arrived at San Francisco just in time to seethe entire city aflame, the great earthquake having just taken the ground fromunder the old city’s pride forever.By contrast, Crowley’s voyage was “twelve days of chilly boredom” with no lifeor stars in sight, followed from Vancouver by an uneventful transcontinentaltrain journey across Canada. Disappointed with his view of the Rockies, thegreat expanse of Canada seemed to dissolve into what he dismissed as thegrayness of Toronto. Finally, his train puffed across the U.S. border atBuffalo, where, in September 1901, President McKinley had fallen to anassassin’s bullet. Keen to be overwhelmed by the elemental grandeur of nearbyNiagara Falls, Crowley felt temporarily relieved. Suddenly he was accosted byfrantic journalists. Crowley presumed they wanted a story about his China walkor mountaineering exploits on Mount Kangchenjunga on the Nepal-Sikkim border theprevious year, but it was all a case of mistaken identity! The pressmen sought aBritish officer who’d got into trouble and hopped across the border: a somewhatsour start to Crowley’s return to America.Catching the next train to New York City, he attended to unexplained “business”and tried to launch Kangchenjunga II. His diary for May 10 reads:Aimage [images/dots.jpg] poor [Crowley’s daily invocation of the Augoeides]—amreally worn out. Asked [the spiritual power of Augoeides] for exceptional vigourand courage and health in N.Y. so as to get my business through. Granted—did allbusiness but the Kangchen[junga] scheme in one day. Most amply granted. Bar theone day’s fever, on a Sunday when in no case could I work, I was boiling overwith energy the whole time.5 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt106]The 1905 attempt on Kangchenjunga with Swiss climber Jacot Guillarmod and acontinental team had been disastrous. Exceptionally hostile weather led totragic deaths and bitter recriminations as to who was to blame. Crowley had beenin command but maintained that orders had been ignored; nerves shattered, hestormed from the scene in fear and disgust. He nevertheless wanted another go atit and hoped to interest patrons of science. As his Confessions express it,Crowley “spent a rather hectic ten days sampling the restaurants and theatres.But as for interesting people in the Himalayas, I might as well have joined theChina Inland Mission. Nobody in New York had even heard of them, unless asmeaningless items in his hated geography lessons. No one could see any sport inmountaineering at all, or any scientific object to be obtained by reaching greatheights. After the first few days I could not even find a listener.”6[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt107]Crowley had some photographs taken of himself in New York, possibly to drum uppublicity. It is thought that the striking prints of Crowley the explorer withswept hair and sheepskin jacket, smoking a colossal meerschaum like his friendEckenstein, looking remarkably “modern” and even “cool,” were taken on thisoccasion. Of course, New Yorkers did have things on their minds other than theEnglishman’s Himalayan adventures. A look at the Sunday edition of the New YorkTribune for May 13, 1906, reminds us of the catastrophe that had hit SanFrancisco and reverberated across the continent while Crowley was snorting atthe Canadian Pacific Railroad’s lack of a good dinner or bottle of wine.The New York Tribune’s usually relaxed Sunday edition for May 13 was full ofpictures of refugees in makeshift shacks in the burned-out ruins of their oncefair city. “Homeless San Franciscans facing fate hopefully in spite ofearthquake and conflagration,” ran the caption. A “Temporary Home in Howard St”consisted of slats of wood slapped against each other; “Refugees in JeffersonSquare”; “Cooking meals in the street”; “A clubless Clubman in Union Square”—thepictures told a grim tale. Odd that Crowley’s return to America should again beaccompanied by visions of hell. A week later, however, the Sunday edition wasback to its regular evocation of New Yorkers’ leisure pursuits. “Central Parkevery year at this time renews its popularity with the little folk”—notleprechauns but photographs of children in delightful Edwardian clothes ofvelvet and lace feeding ducks, riding ponies, and playing with their governessesin the park. One is reminded of early scenes in the mysterious, romantic moviepar excellence Portrait of Jennie (1948).image [images/9781620556313_018.jpg]Fig. 7.5. Aleister Crowley; believed to have been taken in New York, 1906, topromote a Himalayan expedition (Ordo Templi Orientis)Crowley’s recollections of his relatively short stay in New York in 1906 sufferfrom a curious inaccuracy or confusion of memory, spiced with creative writing.It is a rare occurrence in the Confessions to be confronted with a plainfabrication, but that is what we seem to have.After the first days I could not even find a listener. The town had gonecompletely mad; first over Upton Sinclair’s [novel] The Jungle which had madecanned food a drug on the market, though there was practically nothing else toeat; and secondly by the shooting of Stanford White, which let loose all thesuppressed sexual hysteria of the whole population.They would talk of nothing else. Everyone screamed in public and in privateabout satyrs and angel children, and vampires, and the unwritten law, and menhigher up, and stamping out impurity. For the first time in my life I came intocontact with mob madness. Modern morality and manners suppress all naturalinstincts, keep people ignorant of the facts of nature and make them fightingdrunk on bogey tales. They consequently seize upon every incident of this kindto let off steam. Knowing nothing and fearing everything, they rant and rave andriot like so many maniacs. The subject does not matter. Any idea which givesthem an excuse of getting excited will serve. They look for a victim to chivy,and howl him down, and finally lynch him in a sheer storm of sexual frenzy whichthey honestly imagine to be moral indignation, patriotic passion, or someequally avowable emotion. It may be an innocent Negro, a Jew like Leo Frank, aharmless half-witted German; a Christ-like idealist of the type of Debs, anenthusiastic reformer like Emma Goldman or even a doctor whose views displeasethe Medical Trust.7 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt108]While Crowley’s account of “mob psychology” and hysteria over dramatic newsstories involving unusual individuals, especially where sex is concerned, isdoubtless as true today as when he wrote it in the early 1920s, the setting iswild and probably self-serving.Celebrated American architect Stanford White was murdered by Harry K. Thaw atMadison Square Garden’s roof garden theater in revenge for White’s havingseduced Thaw’s wife, Evelyn Nesbit, when she was sixteen (and Whiteforty-seven). A serial seducer of teenage girls, Stanford moved on to enticemany more girls into his wine-dine-and-strip seduction habit. Chorus girl andartist’s model, Nesbit provided entertainment at erotic sessions at StanfordWhite’s specially appointed multistory apartment-for-sex at 22 West 24th Street,where his obsession was acted out without fear of interference. The Hearstpapers reveled in it, calling it repeatedly the “Trial of the Century.” The onlyproblem as regards Crowley’s account is that the murder took place on June 25,by which time Crowley had been back in England for three weeks, grief strickenat news on his return to Liverpool on June 2 that his and Rose’s baby daughter,Lilith, had died weeks before in Rangoon from a fatal infection. Perhaps Crowleyread English reports of the trial in the papers that he claimed to loathe.However, the manner of his description suggests a more intimate response to thescandal. The likelihood would then be that he had a contact or contacts in NewYork at the time who wrote to him about it and that he, years later, imaginedthe scenes he recorded as having witnessed himself. It would be helpful to knowabout any such contacts. Anyhow, it is a rare thing to catch Crowley out on sucha matter of fact.The other cases Crowley mentions are interesting. Leo Frank was a Jewishdirector of a factory in Atlanta, Georgia, where in April 1915 young girl workerMary Phagan had been found strangled. There were serious shortcomings in thetrial evidence, resulting in the commutation of the death penalty to lifeimprisonment by Governor John Slaton. Enflamed by an anti-Semitic backlashagainst Jewish-owned companies employing child labor, Frank was kidnapped byarmed men from prison and lynched in August 1915. Crowley anticipated judicialopinion today by calling Frank a “harmless Jew”; Frank received an officialpardon in 1986.Eugene Victor Debs (1855–1926), union leader and kind-natured socialist, was afounder of the radical, industry-disrupting I.W.W. (Industrial Workers of theWorld). Most remarkably, considering Crowley’s claimed role in promotingAmerican participation in the Great War, Debs was arrested in 1918 for a speechagainst U.S. participation, charged under the Sedition Act of that year, andsentenced to ten year’s imprisonment, commuted in 1921 by President Harding.Crowley’s reference to Emma Goldman (1869–1940) is especially fascinating, asher name will loom amid Crowley’s spying activities during the 1914 to 1918Great War. His description of her as an “enthusiastic reformer,” while doubtlessexpressing his anti-inflammatory view, deliberately avoids the usual descriptionof Russian-born émigré Goldman as “anarchist” and “socialist,” meaning Crowleyhad sympathy with these people and saw how their being labeled undercut theirgenuine character, values, and usefulness. As readers may recall, the man whoshot President McKinley claimed that he had been inspired to do somethingrevolutionary after hearing a speech by Emma Goldman.Crowley understood from bitter experience what being labeled publicly byill-considered or malicious reaction does to an individual. Presumably, Crowleyhad sympathy with the values, if not the “cure,” advocated by socialist andanarchist philosophies. We need to grasp this to get a fix on what Crowley meantwhen he said that he was an “aristocratic anarchist.” It was Goldman whofamously said, “If voting changed anything, they’d make it illegal.”Crowley’s reference to Upton Sinclair’s novel The Jungle, published in February1906 by Doubleday, is also revealing. Passionate socialist, Sinclair (1878–1968)used his novel to describe shockingly exploitative conditions in the Chicagomeatpacking industry, a plaint that led to amelioration of conditions by law,more on account of public fear of unsanitary meat than understanding of wageslavery. This is the background to Crowley’s otherwise easily misunderstood jokeabout Sinclair’s novel having made “canned food a drug on the market,” while hebewails the lack of decent food available generally, on account of industrialstandardization of product and aspiration. From 1918 to 1919, Crowley wouldbecome an habitué of the creative liberal and socialist circles of GreenwichVillage, to which Sinclair was a regular visitor. With Crowley’s background in1890s Symbolism and Decadence, he was bound to find Sinclair’s realist fixationa trifle obsessive and annoying: “laying it on a bit thick” as the English saywhen a sledgehammer is employed to crack a nut. Crowley saw that socialism basedon materialism and the primacy of external, opaque “conditions” and ineluctable“historical forces” would itself become an oppressive phenomenon. He saw clearlythough how religion had become discredited by revolutionaries as the “charity”of the bosses who gave with one hand then took twice as much with the other. Inthe end, sociology has as much propaganda value as conventional history. There’sprecious little science in any of it. Can you weigh a tear, or assess greatnessin grams?What Crowley did find of significant personal value, from the literary point ofview, in New York in May 1906 was Fitzhugh Ludlow’s The Hasheesh Eater, firstpublished by Harper and Bros. in the United States in 1857. The book hadestablished a craze in America for places where cannabis extract could be takenand enjoyed for its own sake. New York–born Ludlow (1836–1870), a clergyman’sson, described the delirious escape from the bonds that kept the soul’s visionin check and how the drug admitted him into realms of extended thought,analysis, and sense-enhanced, dreamy states of consciousness. It was perfectlylegal, and popular forms of cannabis extract created an enthusiastic market.Crowley felt sure this was something he could explore further to great effect,fully aware of the book’s clear warning that overindulgence led to debilitatingpsychological, though not physical, addiction, as well as nightmares,“psychoses,” and fundamental distortion of reality during the period ofingestion. Ludlow lamented how hasheesh easily came to dominate his life anddiminish important life priorities by its seductive siren call of easytransport.On May 22, Crowley interrupted his record of invocations of the “Bornless One”to record in his diary, “Reading The Hashish-Eater, a wonderful book. Sleeping,I got a mild hashish dream!” That Crowley was effectively getting what is todaycalled a “contact high” is confirmed from his diary the next day. “Aimage[images/dots.jpg] at first disturbed—with resolution better. Vision somewhat,but confused with hashish distortion. That book is clearly bewitched.”Crowley sailed from New York to England on the Campania on May 26. By the end ofautumn, measured use of cannabis grains combined with ritual invocation enabledhim finally to complete the Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin the Mage; that is, toexperience the “Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel,”“Samadhi,” with the “Self-glittering one” of his being’s Master. Such was theprimary aim of Crowley’s “Magick” and the cornerstone of his doctrine from thenon."},{"pageContent":"EIGHTimage [images/9781620556313_099.jpg]Art in AmericaJeanne Robert Foster and Aleister Crowley were closer to one another in thesummer of 1911 than either of them knew. Jeanne was on a journalist’s mission toEurope at the behest of Albert Shaw, editor in chief of esteemed criticaljournal the American Review of Reviews. Crowley was getting over flak fromApril’s infamous Looking Glass trial. His friend George Cecil Jones had sued theLooking Glass, a low rag, for libel. Bizarrely, Jones lost his case; it beinghinted at the trial that Crowley was homosexual and that Jones was his friend.Crowley would not defend himself in court, probably because he was bisexual andif the jury heard incontrovertible evidence attesting to the fact, he could havebeen arrested, his public life ruined. The jury was manipulated as to Crowley’salleged immorality. As a result, Crowley lost some good friends, but not all.While Jeanne studied at the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, Crowley restoredhis health with Mater Coeli, his “Mother of Heaven”—that is, violinist,protohippy, beautiful person, and all-round sex goddess Leila Waddell—at nearbyFontainebleau, to which place Crowley would retire occasionally for healthreasons. Officially divorced from Rose in the new year of 1910, Crowley informedhis (then) friend JFC Fuller later that year that he and Leila were joyfullyengaged; no marriage ensued. When autumn 1911 came, Crowley returned to Englandfor the unenviable task of committing his divorced and alcoholically debilitatedwife Rose to an asylum.By then, Jeanne had moved on to Ireland, thence to London, where she enjoyed anemotionally painful few days with the married man she was in love with, whileinvalided husband, Matlack Foster, resided with Jeanne’s family in Schenectady.In London again in August 1914, Jeanne confided to her diary recollections ofher tryst with Albert Shaw in London’s Kew Gardens three years earlier when,with her “heart torn with pain,” her mind “bewildered” by guilt and excitement,she indulged the love of a married man. “Flesh is such a marvel, the body, thebeautiful eyes, the delicate finger tips, the intricacies of nerve and muscle.Then what wonder, when there is the clear pure light of love, the immortalsoul.”1 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt109] The spirituality of Jeanne’s emotionaland physical life radiates from these passages.First introduced to fifty-two-year-old Albert Shaw while on a visit to New Yorkfrom Boston in 1909—the year Jeanne heard and was impressed by TheosophicalSociety leader Annie Besant, also visiting New York—Jeanne fell for the man whowas equally drawn to Jeanne’s intelligence and beauty. Shaw marveled at heractive social conscience, penetrating curiosity, and, above all, deepunderstanding of the Adirondacks—a place of solace that he had consideredprivate. Recognizing Jeanne’s qualities, Shaw surmised editorial work would suither, whereupon, despite the fact that everyone else involved was male, Shawemployed Jeanne on Poetry and Eloquence from the Blue and the Gray, one in aseries of volumes constituting The Photographic History of the Civil War,published by the Review of Reviews Co.Before April 1911’s trial of Jones versus the Looking Glass, Crowley came to theattention not only of the police but also of the press, in Britain and abroad,for his production of what he called The Rites of Eleusis, performed in Londonwith Leila Waddell on violin, poet Victor Neuburg dancing, and other acolytes ofCrowley’s magical order the Aimage [images/dots.jpg]Aimage [images/dots.jpg] inAugust, October, and November 1910. An admiring review flowed from friendRaymond Radclyffe’s pen into the Daily Sketch on August 24. “If there is anyhigher form of artistic expression than great verse and great music, I have yetto learn it.” The show was something of an Edwardian version of an early PinkFloyd concert, with lighting effects and a potion passed round. Its performancepolarized opinion in much the same way as Pink Floyd did in the late 1960s andearly 1970s.Impressed by the reaction, Crowley moved the rites to Caxton Hall, Westminster.I have seen one of the original tickets, very well produced. It could have beenfrom the “Monterey Pop” Festival of 1967. Tickets cost five guineas, an enormoussum, for the complete seven rites.Blackmailer De Wend Fenton’s scandal rag, the Looking Glass, ran a predictablesmutty put-down of The Rites of Eleusis on November 12: the first serious attackon Crowley to appear in a public paper, even if it was lavatory paper. Theheadline read, An Amazing Sect. It promised “The Origin of their Rites and theLife History of Mr. Aleister Crowley.” De Wend Fenton’s modus operandi was toprint a “taster” of scandal, calculate possible legal implications in proportionto sales, then offer a way out for the victim: a one-off payment to avoidfurther “revelations.” Crowley told Fenton what he could do with his threat, andthe Looking Glass went to work making a calculated attack on Crowley’s friends,implying that they were deserving of the trials of Oscar Wilde.Jeanne was quite likely acquainted with the story, for its salacious telling wascabled stateside for readers of the Washington Post, which ran a long, sarcasticaccount on November 27, 1910, cobbled together from misquoted extracts fromCrowley’s journal The Equinox combined with tidbits about the performances,headlined:TEACHING TITLED BEAUTIES TO RAISE EVIL SPIRITSDiversion of English Society Which Is Conjuring “Demons” and Practicing the“Black Art”—But Seems to Need a Lot More PracticeLondon. Nov. 20.The titled beauties of England and for that matter beauties without titles andtitles without beauty, have taken up most earnestly the pursuit of the higher“black art,” the conjuration of spirits evil and otherwise, the revival ofancient mysteries, such as those of Eleusis, for profanation of which beautifulGrecian Phryne was condemned to death and saved only by her advocate snatchingaside her garments and dazzling her judges.Not perhaps since the days of Cagliostro and of the beginnings of theSpiritualistic era has such a fever for occultation and weird rites thatflourish best at midnight seized upon aristocratic and literary London. Perhapsthe cause is the dullness of the court of George and Mary, as contrasted to thealways-something-doing reign of Edward. Perhaps it is only the natural progressfrom mind healing, Indian Swamis, Theosophy, and ghost hunting. At any rate, asthe witty Countess of Warwick said the other day, “Everybody seems to have theirhearts set on raising the devil!”The leader of the movement is Aleister Crowley, a distinguished English poet andliteratear. He leads a society which, in 1888, revived the old order of theRosicrucians, that medieval society of mystics, which even up to the end of theeighteenth century had for its members all the astrologers and alchemists, andmost of the great scholars, chemists, and sages. If it had remained as it wastwo decades ago—a staid community of enthusiasts and dreamers—there would havebeen no occasion now to remark upon it, save as a curious reappearance ofmysticism in modern time.But in the last five years the society has spread amazingly, and its adherentsare in every country. Within the last year the soulful branch of the Englisharistocracy has embraced it, and chapters are soon to give demonstrations in theUnited States.Even Sir Oliver Lodge has not been above attending various séances in ascientific effort to discover if the old incantations could really raiseanything. The beautiful and eccentric Lady Marjorie Manners, the daughter of theequally eccentric Duchess of Rutland, is said to be among the foremost of theRosicrucians.Meetings of the Rosicrucians for the purpose of conjuration and of invoking“forbidden knowledge” have been secret until last week. Then the Eleusinianrites were performed openly in a London hall. The original rites were celebratedin ancient Greece, in honor of Demeter or Ceres, the earth mother or goddess,and to Persephone of Proserpine, her daughter, who was captured by Pluto, god ofthe underworld.Purpose to Attain Religious EcstasyThe modern Rosicrucians admit frankly that their purpose is to attain religiousecstasy, and to get into communication with spirits, not disembodied commonspirits which on earth were plain John Jones or William Smith, but spirits thatwere powerful when Lilith flirted with Adam and haven’t any place in arespectable Church of England heaven.Lady Marjorie isn’t certain that she has seen any spirits yet and betrays animpatience that may take her from the fold soon if her curiosity isn’tgratified. Raising the spirits is hard work according to the formulae prescribedby Poet Crowley, in his book, The Equinox, which, by the way, come down quitedirectly from the ancient sources. Sometimes it takes six months to raise eventhe semblance of one, and if the conjurator has fallen down anywhere during thattime the spirit either doesn’t appear or else the applicant is afflicted in amanner that makes Job’s lot seem like a pleasant dream.For instance, the new Rosicrucians are very desirous of evoking the mightyspirit Taphthartharath, who seems to have knowledge of a lot of things theywould like to learn from him. An elaborate “temple” has to be prepared for theconjuration. The ceremony takes a lot of people. If they can’t getTapthartharath, he must be a very unreasonable and unaccommodating spirit.However, when the “Temple”—and it is very awe inspiring—is prepared, theRosicrucians begin. The Magus of Art is usually a woman, and this is the partthe titled beauties just simply love to take. She wears a white robe, yellowsash, red overmantic, indigo nemyss; upon her breast she wears a great tabletwhereon is the magic seal of Mercury; and over this “the Lamen bearing thesignature of Taph on its obverse and the Lamen of a Hierophant.” She wears adagger in her sash and a red rose on her heart; and she carries in her left handthe Ankh of Thoth—that is the old crux ansata or cross of life of the Egyptians,and in her right the Ibis wand. This, in the language of ’Arry, is a neat but abit gaudy outfit. The assistant does his best to compete. He wears a white robewith a girdle of snakeskin, a black headdress; he bears in his right hand asword, in his left hand a magical candle, and a black chain about his neck. Incommanding tones the chief Magus cries.[There follows a long, satirically garbled version of a magical invocation.]But if Taph doesn’t come—and there isn’t any record that he ever has—why thenthe worshippers go over it all again at the next meeting night? It must makeTaph feel something dreadful. And they’re all, as has been said, such nicegirls, too.Has any one ever raised the spirits? Well now! Poet Crowley’s book, The Equinox,which relates at length these conjurations, tells of a very earnest seeker whofor six months followed the exceedingly rigorous and ascetic course prescribedfor the Rosicrucian way of seeing things. What he saw irresistibly reminds oneof easier ways of seeing them—and not so ascetic. This is what he says happened:“In bed I invoked the Fire angels and the spirits on the tablet, with names,&c., and the 6th Key. I then (as Harpocrates) entered my crystal. An angelmeeting me told me among other things, that they were at war with the angels ofthe 30 Aethyrs to prevent the squaring of the circle. I went with him into theabodes of Fire, but I must have fallen asleep, or nearly so. Anyhow, I regainedconsciousness being there and half there.“I recovered and banished the spirits, but was burning all over and tossedrestlessly about—very sleepy, but consumed of fire. (Note—Nothing is said hereabout the singular hallucination of a circumambulating bedroom.) Then I had along dream of a woman eloping, whom I helped, and after of a man stealing myrose cross jewel from a dressing table in a hotel. I caught him, and found him aman weak beyond the natural (I could bend or flatten him at will) and then thedream seemed to lose coherency—I carried him about and found a hair brush tobeat him, &c., &c. Query: Was I totally obsessed?”You were, brother, indeed you were! But many a man could have gone you severalbetter on that vision and not have them six months to hatch it either.A couple of months after this story graced American newsstands, Jeanne wasadvised that if she wanted to experience the best show in New York she shouldget herself down to the unassuming Petitpas restaurant, run by a pair of Bretonsisters on 317 West 29th Street. There she could witness the magical voice ofold John Butler Yeats (1839–1922), who held regular court over a long tablewhose main dish was the rich sauce of a conversation stirred and ladled toadmirers by the distinguished Irish painter.J. B. Yeats was father to poet W. B. Yeats, who had rebelled against his occultmentor Samuel Mathers in the Golden Dawn, launched a magical attack on Crowleyin 1900, and subsequently gone his own occult way with London colleagues. One ofthose who declined to go with W. B. Yeats and company, and who became Mathers’snew London representative, Dr. Edward Berridge, was about to turn witnessagainst Crowley’s character in the Looking Glass trial in London, intimating tothe jury that Crowley was homosexual (this from a man who had scandalized Ordermember Annie Horniman in 1899 with his advocacy of sexual relations with“elementals” on the astral plane).image [images/9781620556313_019.jpg]Fig. 8.1. John Butler Yeats(1839–1922),by photographer, AliceBoughton(1866–1943)In early 1911, following advice, Jeanne seated herself at one of the Petitpasrestaurant’s small square tables and began taking notes of the old master’s bonsmots. Never one to miss a beautiful thing, or person, John Butler Yeats invitedthe beauty to join him at table. Soon he was captivated, as was she. Perceivingthe depth of his spirit in the girdle of his charm, Jeanne adored the volubleartist, taking him with her to the Poetry Society and National Arts Club,Grammercy Park, JBY being perennially strapped for cash. As Jeanne’s biographerputs it, “Jeanne, as she did with many other men in her life, dismissed orignored the negative aspects of JBY’s advice and concentrated on what was usefulto her.”2 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt110] She learned a great deal from JBY,developing through him a fascination with Ireland. She took his advice to visitYeats’s close relatives in Dublin and became a lifelong intimate of the family.Thus, after her time in Paris, she traveled from England to Ireland in autumn1911, while her employer and lover, Albert Shaw, observing her progressadmiringly, felt encouraged to give Jeanne more responsibility for the Review ofReviews’s literary and art sections. As literary editor, Jeanne developed the“New Books” section, while combining poetry criticism with a burgeoning passionfor art.Hopelessly devoted to JBY’s son’s poetry, Jeanne revisited Ireland in 1912, onlyto become distressed at the depths of poverty endured by so many Irish people.Intending to interview celebrated writer George Moore (1852–1933), Jeanneapproached his door but was suddenly overcome with nerves. Perhaps the cause wasMoore’s reputation for womanizing. Perhaps she had read Hail and Farewell ’ssequel, Ave, published the previous year, in which Moore made wry swipes at W.B. Yeats’s alleged intellectual monomania, eagerness to prophesy, and his beingone “whose granaries are in the past.” Jeanne withdrew from Moore’s door but, asshe told Richard Londraville, determined thenceforth never to permit fear toobtrude between herself and experiences necessary to a journalist, and more, toa budding poet open to reality and the ideal.In England that same year Jeanne exhibited her genuine social conscience whentaking notes on enlightened employers constructing garden cities for theirworkers: planned estates such as Port Sunlight on the Wirral, near Liverpool.The absence of similar large-scale acts of concern in the United States put herhome country behind in this field. Jeanne had already used the pages of theReview of Reviews to highlight “The Case of Women in State Prisons” in July 1911and would highlight “Woman and the Age Question” in April 1914. Her seriouscommitment to reform of schools, immigrant conditions, and prisons would last along lifetime. Maybe Crowley’s sympathy with socialist confrontation with thefacts of life would have found some common ground, because both writers werespiritual idealists, though singing in rather different keys.While Jeanne found herself in Edinburgh in 1912 for the Review of Reviews,interviewing prominent American Rodin-influenced sculptor George Gray Barnard(1863–1938) as he studied Michelangelo’s works, Crowley undertook the first ofan intended three-part series of articles titled “Art in America” for theEnglish Review (though not published until November 1913).Jeanne’s and Crowley’s approach to art criticism could not have differed more.Jeanne wrote with sensitivity, interest, and considerable sentimentality, ratherlike a schoolteacher exhorting her charges to consider this and consider thatwhen reading unseen texts for homework. She saw it as her task to express thevalue of what she herself valued, and her critical pieces consequently make foreasy, persuasive reading. She introduced subjects with just sufficientearnestness to hold the casual reader’s attention, before expatiating withclarity and notable originality of phrase.As late as 1921, John Butler Yeats advocated the profound need for seriouscritics of American art, writing to Jeanne Foster, in whose poetry he tookbenign interest, “There is plenty of genius in your poetry, indeed for thatmatter there is plenty in America—but where is the artist? There are no artistsbecause there are no critics—the critic does the analysis, scientifically andcoldly—and then the artist discovers himself, comes to birth in the man ofgenius.”3 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt111] Get that: man of genius. With Crowley,of course, you got criticism, as JBY wanted it, and genius: too much for manycasual readers.It should be noted that Crowley’s extant review “Art in America” only dealt withthe past; he had planned two more pieces on American art’s present and future,but the title was taken as a blanket criticism and upset a number of Americanjournalists. Crowley did announce his intentions. “We can then fold our wingssadly over our faces when we contemplate the past (in this article I avoiddealing with the present) of American literature.” We shall look at what upsetsome American journalists presently.Crowley’s decision to assess the state of art in America was timely, even justahead of its moment. Indeed, had he waited a few months, and had he been in NewYork a few months later, the piece that earned him little in America but insultsmight have been quite different.In February 1913, Jeanne’s attention was seized by news of a controversialexhibition of contemporary art, taking place at the Armory of the 69th Regimentin New York City. Its financier was John Quinn, a critical figure in Crowley’sfirst year in New York from November 1914. A highly successful lawyer, artcollector, and sometime friend and admirer of John Butler Yeats, Quinn had notyet met Jeanne Foster, but he had probably heard of her; in time, he would fallin love with her, and vice versa . . .Sponsored by the Association of American Painters and Sculptors, the 1913 ArmoryShow marked a seminal event in the story of American art. It included all thelatest European styles, shocking styles in their day: movements that moved,moved and shoved everything else into the past. There were futurists,pointillists, cubists, vorticists, fauvists, neo-impressionists.President Theodore Roosevelt, accepting Quinn’s invitation to attend, toleratedmuch of the “shock of the new” but drew the line at Marcel Duchamp, whose workthe president positively hated, affronted by the artist’s obvious dismissal ofthe viewer’s feelings. Seduction was one thing; the cold, stained enamel of theartist’s shoulder was another matter.Jeanne Foster eschewed the stance of automatic reaction and did her best tounderstand. “They seek the inner meaning behind the bodily form—the divineessence in nature.”4 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt112] Abstraction couldaccommodate and express spiritual ideas. Not put off by what many saw as afrightful loss of visual reality, Jeanne bravely observed “that objects inmovement multiply themselves (a runaway horse has not four legs but twenty),that space does not exist (a wet street of puddles of water reflecting thelights and the stars is hollow to the center of the earth) . . .” She wasmothering a new generation, mindful of her duty to the American mind.Nevertheless, she had a little, matronly lesson for the artists. “While theirgreat imaginative vision makes much of their work interesting and worthattention, they need some common basis of agreement in their interpretations—acommon language that will make their work intelligible.”5[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt113] One suspects that this stricture would not havegone down well with any artist struggling to project what was imagined to be anew language, but what she was saying was that if the new was unintelligible,then its language was void: artists spoke only to themselves. But of course theweight of expectation of the artist is that the viewer acquires new eyes, andwith them, fresh perspectives on language. Crowley’s mature view was that theartist should always try to give the viewer a way in, if he or she wished tocommunicate at all.A remarkable feature of the Armory Exhibition was that it housed the mostextensive ever collection of contemporary American art (even though these workswere not included when the show toured the country). American artists includedthe intriguing personality of Robert Winthrop Chanler (1872–1930). A scion ofthe Dudley-Winthrop and Astor families, “Bob” Chanler would befriend Crowleywhen the Beast came to reside in Greenwich Village in 1918 and would not onlypaint his portrait but become the first admiring critic of Crowley’s ownpainting, after the Magus took to the brush in late 1917.The beauty of Chanler’s screens, exhibited at the Armory, struck Jeanne Foster.“The ‘Leopard and Deer’ screen,” she noted, “resembles a Beardsley drawing inits mastery of the grotesque; the ‘Porcupine screen’ is a symphony of dullblues, silver and white; another reveals a scene of tropical deep-sea splendor,corals, devil fish and the beady phosphorescence of trailing sea-weed.”6[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt114] Somewhat toadying up to the prominent financier,Jeanne took her conclusion from John Quinn’s speech at the opening. “If some ofthe new art fails it is for the reason that John Quinn has given, ‘that it islacking in intellect and there can be no permanently satisfactory substitute forbrains.’” Jeanne Foster wisely accepts change, and more change to come, lestthose who shock today, bore tomorrow. “Every generation has a rhythm of its ownart and the succeeding generations will break up their rhythm and form as surelyas age follows age.”7 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt115] Clearly the writerembraced the wisdom of the ages, giving her the perspective of a kindly,encouraging, but somehow just a little bit irritating school marm. But as theBroadway choreographer was heard to exclaim: “With those legs—who cares?” Jeannecould get away with it. She had brains all right.Appearing in the English Review’s November issue, Crowley’s essay “Art inAmerica” surged through the Atlantic like a racing clipper to stir immediatefoam on t’other side of the pond. If Crowley himself was not in America in 1913,some of his critical thoughts certainly were.The English Review’s editor, Austin Frederic Harrison (1873–1928), formerpolitical editor of the Observer, did make the point that these were theopinions of the writer, and the Review was not responsible for them, so Harrisonmust have anticipated controversy, if indeed he wasn’t courting it; Harrisonrecognized the value of controversy, demonstrated at the outbreak of war withGermany, as we shall see. Crowley’s letter about the article to Austin Harrisonhas survived from September 1913 and implies the editor’s uneasiness with theway Crowley expressed what he had to say and his desire to bring its level downto that of the average English reader.Dear Austin Harrison,I am afraid you will never acquire literary sense. . . .on receipt of the £20 I will endeavour to remove any spark of liveliness or witthat may be lurking in the article, and in every other way try to lower it tothe standard of the “English Review.” But, if in the course of an honest day’swork I do my best in this matter, and if you then want to put it into poetry orDorsetshire dialect, or in the style of Tolstoi or Josh Billings, I shallrequire a refresher.By this means, I hope, we shall keep as much goodwill in business, as we have ingolf. [There follows an argument about a golf match they recently enjoyed;Crowley’s handicap was fourteen.]If we are not always careful, the millions who have already broken away fromGolf by using illegal Clubs will introduce billiard cue putters, and howitzerdrivers, and get their balls out of bunkers by electricity. The Rules of Golfshould be studied as conscientiously as the study of the works of the Fathers,and the rigour of their application should remind one of the Trappists.Now it is off my chest,Yours ever,Aleister Crowley8 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt116]One thing is soon evident in Crowley’s article. While Crowley was genuinelyfamiliar with many works by American writers, poets, painters, and sculptors,his interest was not to criticize in depth individual works but rather toattempt a broad analysis of the way artistic culture functioned socially inAmerica and how it was bound up with the psychology of the developing country.He told it the way he saw it. Thus:Of American culture, I have one perfect sample. Travelling from Nagasaki to HongKong two mature maidens from Massachusetts discovered that I sometimes wrote,and “took me up.” “And who,” I asked, “is your favorite poet?”A warm flush overspread each sallow cheek as the two thin mouths exclaimed“Rossetti!” “And which” (I tactlessly pursued) “which of his poems do you likethe best?”This remark closed the conversation. They had put the name Rossetti down in anotebook; and right there “culture” ended.This I found characteristic of many American women. I have seen American girlsin Italy laboriously writing down the names of more painters than I shall everknow, without any further comment than the dates at which they painted. To ask asingle question on the broadest lines was to court silence; in fact, it becamethe most useful method in my daily life and conversation.Crowley, like Symbolist and Decadent artists in general, was a great admirer ofEdgar Allan Poe (1809–1849), of his prose anyhow; Crowley considered Poe’spoetry fairly flat by comparison. However, he remarked that Poe’s settingstended to be European, the style likewise. Crowley was amazed that a countryfounded by people who carried Shakespeare, Bunyan, and the King James Bible withthem to lands of such varied and epic grandeur had not, in the past at least,been inspired to greatness in art. He had no difficulty in expressing thevirtues of Walt Whitman (1819–1892), his faults likewise.Whitman is almost equally unconvincing as far as scenery goes. The secret of allNature-poetry is the interpretation of every phenomenon as a direct dealing ofGod with the soul,*54 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft54] and Whitman rarely reachesto be more than a recorder or reflector of Nature. It stirs him at times to bigthoughts, but hardly ever in that intimate manner, the sense of necessity, whichwe see in Keats, Coleridge, and even Wordsworth.And yet he [Whitman] does something better than all this, he gets as none otherever got it, the sense of vast open space and the vigorous autochthon rejoicingin his strength—man made one with the biggest kind of Nature. . . . In fact, ifwe are to take the loftiness of the habitual plane of thought to be the firstqualification of a great artist, Poe and Whitman stand alone.Nevertheless, Crowley penetrates to the flaws in Whitman’s writing, when judgedin terms of claims to the first rank. “A great mind, perhaps; it seems to me asif that mind had been overwhelmed by the immensity of its material. He obtainedsuch mystic rapture from every object that he could do nothing but scribble downits name!” Crowley notes this curious fascination with names of places: anAmerican song or poem can achieve a response simply through repetition ofplace-names. Had he heard it in 1912, the song “Route 66” would have served asperfect illustration of this. We learn absolutely nothing about Pomona orFlagstaff, Arizona: it is a chant whose soul is obscured by the blur ofchromium-plate; one has zipped through the body of America without the anguishof experiencing it.Crowley knows perfectly well he is treading on corns, that deification of thehero is endemic to American culture, in the Greek sense, and that the peoplegenerally don’t like criticism at all. It goes, he observes, against theuniversal American discovery that positive thinking with a strong inoculation ofmindless optimism can bring in the bucks, and that this superstition, orconfidence trick played on the superficial self, though practically valid attimes, passes for faith. What Crowley is getting at is that American culturedisplayed to him a fundamental problem with scale and proportion and that thishad something to do with the daunting expanses of the continent: Go West, youngman!—and you just keep going. George Washington is a “big” hero, so his statuemust be trans-Olympian as though assumed like Elijah, Constantine, or theCatholic Virgin to the invisible heavens, whereas back on earth, “superiority”is despised in the name of the demos. Somehow, Nature, the vast continent, hadhit the pride and sensorium of the British and European migrant, and with itwent all the talk about “conquering Nature”: an impossible, indeed undesirable,objective for anyone living off Her indulgence. As Nature is the first mirror ofthe artistic soul, Crowley had a profound point to make. Americans might own theland, but they had not inwardly possessed it, or been possessed by it. Proof ofpurchase came with paper, or bullets. The so-called redskins had learned toaccommodate the Great Spirit and see its maternal presence in the land, whileEuropean Catholics and Protestants imported their God, in books, and tried toproject it, making every solitary grave on the prairie look rather mean,melancholy, and out of place: reality could very soon look like despair onearth; best move on. Thus Arizona doubles for Palestine, and every migrant is aMoses subduing the Amalekites. Destiny, precisely, was not manifest, butimposed. What one feels Crowley was getting at was that American art lacked thenecessary historical development through enlightened paganism that characterizedEuropean artistic sensitivity, whose Renaissance finery made the “plainProtestant” of the Plains wince.Crowley notes a persistent didacticism in American poetry, the singing, evenparroting of learned ideas, beliefs or guaranteed-not-to-break “great thoughts,”whereas, Crowley declares, “In Art a man’s views count for nothing. It is acurious paradox that a man can only write if he is so white-hot over somethingthat his work pours through him, not from him; and yet it is not of the leastimportance what that something is. . . . What does it matter whether anyone isright? If he does right, it will last.”Nevertheless, Crowley can well appreciate Whitman’s confrontation with scale forits own sake and how he mirrors, not so much Nature herself, but Americancultural characteristics.From the philosophical, and even more from the human view, Whitman is an artistsupreme in so far as he mirrors the spirit of his time and country. He has thechildish petulance and bombast and enthusiasm, the gross, naked lust and theultra-refined delicacy, the essential rough vigor, the hurry, the conceit, theegoism, the astounding incompetence and the still more astounding capacity, theJingoism, even the cant, of the American-as-he-is-in-himself, the Yank an sich.I find meaning even in the strings of names; I understand how, in a country sonew and generous, the mere crying of the names of things fills the soul withecstasy—the ecstasy of poetry. Whitman says “lint, bandages, iodo-form” as theGreeks said “Thalassa! Thalassa!” [“The Sea! The Sea!”] and thereby conjures avision of all the heroism and suffering of the War of Secession.Crowley looks forward to the day when the American creates rather than acquireshis Culture. “We must not,” he writes, “expect his literature to follow ourlines. His literature is to come. We shall know when it does—it will bestupendous, it will be gigantic and elemental beyond all experience. It willkeep our rules. It can only come with a settlement of some of the main socialand political problems; but when it does, we shall, I believe, clearly recognizeWalt Whitman as the fountain and origin of it all. . . . Whitman is America. Heis the real thing, the spirit of the new continent made word. Not the voice ofimported culture, or any other thing inessential. He is raw, untutored,tameless, crude, the America of the War. I have lived on the prairie myself [inMexico], and I recognize the note.”Poe and Whitman engage Crowley’s admiration. Mark Twain he regards as not agreat artist, be he ever so popular; “Longfellow is merely the polite professor;he has little learning, even for an undergraduate, and he has never penetrated asingle mu into the varnish of any drawing-room idea. Smooth, shallow optimism, afaith even more frock-coated and silk-hatted than Tennyson’s, a style absolutelywooden.” Henry James was still alive when Crowley was writing. Crowley hasrecognized his genius. “Henry James, good or bad, is too important and too subjudice to discuss in this brief appreciation of the literary stars that spangleOld Glory.” Crowley was of course familiar with the author of The Last of theMohicans. “Another well-known writer in England is James Fenimore Cooper. He,again, succeeded chiefly by the novelty of his themes; his method is stilted,and after all he is only boyhood’s friend. That I still like him onlyproves—what everybody knows—that I have never grown up.”In vain does cheeky Crowley seek originality in American art; why, he exclaims,even the national anthem “My Country ’Tis of Thee!” is sung to the tune of “Godsave the King” (this was before the adoption of “The Star Spangled Banner” in1931)!And why is it? Why is it that with everything in favor of new birth, of“variation,” we find so very little born? Consider the astounding avidity withwhich the American swallows every kind of idea, the rage for literature, thesubsidizing of Art, the passion for music. Consider even the new blood thatpours into the States to the tune of two millions a year from everyart-producing country in Europe: and wonder grows, and grows.Americans say that the immigrants are the scum of Europe. Perhaps, but they beatthe native out of most of his money and power in no time. Isn’t there a touchingsong about the “poor exile of Erin” who in a fortnight became “Alderman Mikeinthrojuicing a bill”?There is, firstly, the question of a critical faculty. This is clearly infantinein nearly all Americans. A Man will determine to study philosophy. To whom doeshe go? To Kant? To Hume? To Aristotle? Dear me, no! He is quite happy with FraElbertus [Elbert Hubbard b. 1856],*55 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft55] with hissham Kelmscott Press [Hubbard led an American version of Englishman WilliamMorris’s Arts and Crafts Movement: the Roycrofters] and his platitudes, or withSwami Vivekananda, that burliest of Babus. It never strikes him to defer to theUpanishads, from which Vivekananda derived all that is of value in his work.. . . As a matter of fact, I have sometimes met Americans whose native goodsense made them finely appreciative of good work. But they are too often “putoff their game” by the comments of “cultured” posers, usually of that Presswhich has discovered that “woman is the market,” and thought it best to writedown to the assumed level of woman’s intellect.Now, as Wilde urged, criticism is the foundation of creation; at least, it isthe negative side of creation. And so, with no power of selection from theenormous mass of material at his disposal, he is entirely incompetent to do muchmore than copy the people he admires.Crowley wonders what may be adduced from the effects of climate on the Americanpsyche and observes that New York, for example, shares its latitude with Madrid“and can be a great dea’ [sic] hotter than Madrid.” While nature urges behaviorakin to the Madrileños, “the Puritan conscience is in absolute antipathy to thelazily, lazily, drowsily, drowsily frame of mind. So the people ‘get a move on’and restlessly rage throughout the day—and get nothing done. ‘Festina lente’ and‘More haste, less speed’ ought to be painted up at every street corner in NewYork.”Crowley has gazed in awe at the continent’s epic size, lyrical detail, dramaticmotion, and wonders if the cause of artistic weakness has been the absence of asettled order of things, where there is no standard acquiesced in for centuries.“In Europe,” he observes, “the overturning of the dynasties has usually been thesignal for an outburst of every kind of art. Here, however, there is in a sensenothing to overturn. People drift from Methodism to Zionism through Theosophy,Christian Science, and Nut-foodism, without a single wavelet over their mentalgunwale. If you tell a man that black is white, he gets thoughtful, and says:‘Yes, stranger, I guess that is so.’” If that doesn’t explain things, Crowley istempted to fall back on the platitude that America is a “very young country. Itis true: there is so much to do that no one has time to reflect. Poetry is bornin the stillness of the soul; boredom is one of its chief stimuli. Thecommercialism of the country is too rampant.”Looking briefly to the future, Crowley envisions greatness to come.No doubt, when immigration stops, when the negro problem, and the Japaneseproblem, and the labor problem, and the political problem, and all the rest ofthe problems are solved, when a class arises which has time to reflect upon lifeinstead of living it, American art will lead the world.Until then, the theme is likely to continue to overwhelm the artist. Whitmanalone has risen to the height of destiny; and Whitman was baulked by his ownmind. He was Being without Form, as Poe was Form without Being; and creation isthe marriage of these twain.Well, there was a reaction!—much of it predictable.The Chicago Daily Tribune of November 23, 1913, simply listed some of Crowley’smost provocative statements, believing them to stand as self-condemning bythemselves. “‘I am cursed with a public school and university education,’ saysMr. Crowley, ‘although luckily I was born with enough native sense to shirk thesoulless ritual of it so far as might be, and its bad influence has beencorrected by years of wandering in the wilds.’ The ‘curse’ was lifted. Mr.Harrison and the English Review may wish that it had stuck.”The State newspaper, published in South Carolina’s capital, Columbia, onDecember 7, 1913, tried to look on the bright side but was unsure whether theopinion of the unknown Aleister Crowley was to be accorded respect.ALEISTER CROWLEY HAS LITTLE GOOD TO SAY OF AMERICAN ART BUT LOOKS AHEADLondon, Nov. 19. What do you know about Aleister Crowley? Ever heard of himbefore? Neither had I until I found an article by him on “Art in America” in thecurrent English Review, cheek by jowl with one by Israel Zangwill on “TheMilitant Suffragettes.” Since then I have looked Crowley up in Who’s Who, butwithout finding him so much as mentioned therein, and all that I know about himnow, apart from the fact that he doesn’t consider that America has produced anyart or that Americans have any real culture is (and this I read in the Times)that he was the ringleader of those who removed the coverings that the Frenchauthorities caused to be placed over Jacob Epstein’s now famous memorial toOscar Wilde in Père Lachaise cemetery the other night, without, apparently,getting any thanks for so doing from the sculptor thereof. [Crowley had removedthe brass butterfly attached by Paris city authorities to the genitals of thefigure on Epstein’s Wilde monument as a gesture of artistic freedom.]However, since he is welcomed to the pages of the periodical which publishesMasefield, Hewlett, and, incidentally, John Heiston, one supposes that AleisterCrowley must have some standing in the literary world, though it is worth notingthat the editor of the English Review is careful to remark that Crowley’sopinions are not necessarily those of the periodical. The fact is that Crowleyis the superior person in excelsis, yet this article on “Art in America”contains some thought and its author reveals a wider reading of Americanliterature than most natives can claim. He says, too, that he has lived on theprairie, and he glories in the grandeur of American scenery.. . . Even this writer, however, is hopeful of America, and his article is notwholly a “roast.” “The Himalayas,” he remarks, “are too big for any one to sing,and America is all Himalayas of one kind or another.”image [images/9781620556313_020.jpg]Fig. 8.2. Walter Duranty (1884–1957)On January 30, 1914, residents of Baltimore, Maryland, opened copies of the Sunto a review that fired off with a list of inflammatory quotations, under theheadline “NO AMERICAN ART,” SAYS AN IRISH CRITIC. It is interesting that Crowleywas still identified in America as a son of Erin as well as “Poet, MountainClimber, Buddhist—Man Who Smashed Oscar Wilde’s Monument” and the instigator ofthe following literary outrages. “The boasted inventions of the Americans do notexist; what they invent is notions based on the discoveries of others.” “Theonly bright spot in American literature is humor. Of course, humor is the mostperishable of commodities.” “The only American sculptor I know is a Lithuanianliving in Paris.”*56 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft56]The paper reported that a New York Times correspondent in Paris had corneredCrowley “in his den” and taken him to task over some of the details. Thecorrespondent was probably Walter Duranty (1884–1957), sometime lover ofCrowley’s who visited him during his and Victor Neuburg’s experimentalsex-magick invocations of the gods Mercury and Jupiter in January and February1914.The Sun reproduced snippets of Crowley’s responses to questions put to him inParis.About music—“I have never heard of Nevin or Herbert.”About “My Country, ’Tis of Thee”—“Well, it has the same tune as ‘God Save theKing’” (therefore, of course, it is a parody).About inventions—“Fulton only adapted a principle already discovered. TheWrights are following the lines laid out by others. Morse only improved thetelegraphic system.”About Medicine—“I was not aware the Sir Bertram Dawson, the King’s physician,had said that he had to go to America to learn surgery and that the Mayobrothers, of Rochester, Minnesota, were the finest surgeons in the world.”“When I wrote of sculpture I had forgotten about Macmonnies.”“I was not aware that Jenny Lind was born in Sweden.” [Crowley had stated herswas the greatest voice in America.]A Many-Sided GeniusBut Crowley himself was found a very interesting personality. Parisians say ofhim: “He’s a mountain climber: holds a lot of records in the Himalayas andMexico.” “He’s a well-known Buddhist: has been to Tibet and got initiated intoall their mysteries.” “He’s a leading Freemason and past master Rosicrucian.”“He’s a worker of magic: holds séances and raises devils.” “He’s the man whomutilated Oscar Wilde’s monument at Père Lachaise.”Aleister Crowley is, in fact, a poet—the most prolific poet of the present day,the Times correspondent finds. He has produced a vast quantity of poetry, all ofit strange, much of it wonderful, parts of it horrible, and none of it popular.In appearance he is a thick-set man of about 40, with a strong, square head, anda high forehead. His skull is shaved bald.He lives in a studio in Paris, a high, bright room, decorated with magicsquares, a big bronze butterfly, ice-axes and alpine-stocks, futurist paintings,old English engravings and images of pagan gods.Hates England, Likes AmericaHe says he is an Irishman and hates England worse than poison. “I would ratherbe a dog than an Englishman,” he cried vehemently, and he has never ceased tolash the bitterest pen in Europe the country that has refused to recognize hisgenius.For America he expresses the highest admiration and affection, in spite of hisharsh criticisms. He once visited the country and wrote a fervid “Hymn to theAmerican People” as he crossed the Rockies on Independence Day, 1901.*57[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft57]image [images/9781620556313_021.jpg]Fig. 8.3. Aleister Crowley circa 1910–1913Crowley’s expressed disgust with much that he experienced in England, sociallyand politically, would a) make it easier for him to appear as an anti-Britishrenegade for espionage purposes in World War I, and b) further prejudice thoseconvinced that Crowley was a traitor to his country during that period. Thisevidential ambiguity then leaves open the question of what motivated him toarrive in New York at the end of October 1914, after the start of the war,giving his nationality as Irish, of English residency. Had a personal “ideal”identity simply become habitual, or was it part of a deliberate cover forpurposes undisclosed?A remarkable letter from Crowley to his O.T.O. (Ordo Templi Orientis) treasurerGeorge Macnie Cowie of November 20, 1913, puts a completely fresh slant onCrowley’s “Irish” identity. He begins by telling Cowie that he is “going to seeLarkin tonight.” Here is a rare piece of evidence that Crowley, at least on thisoccasion, was concerned with political developments in Ireland, for James Larkin(1876–1947) was a socialist organizer of trades unions in Ireland, who in thesummer and autumn of 1913 had instigated a watershed event in the history ofIrish labor relations, the Dublin Lockout. After organizing the Sligo DockStrike, Larkin attempted to get nonunionized workers of the Dublin UnitedTramway Company to join the Irish Transport and General Workers Union (ITGWU),against the will of company chairman and newspaper proprietor, William MartinMurphy. There were protracted lockouts, firings, sympathy strikes, wage cuts,newspaper condemnation of the workers and union leaders, and vicious policebeatings of those who came to hear Larkin speak. The Catholic Church in Dublinrefused to assist strikers’ hungry families. In November, amid protest fromBritish trades unionists and socialist sympathizers, Larkin was charged withsedition and arrested, but the Liberal government had second thoughts. Releasedon November 13, Larkin came to London to address the Parliamentary Committee ofthe Trades Union Congress, while the socialist Daily Herald organized an eveningmeeting at the Albert Hall for November 20, of which Larkin was principalspeaker. This meeting Crowley apparently attended. After the lockout finallyended in early 1914, Larkin—who declared that he did not recognize English rulein Ireland—went to New York and took further radical steps, joining thesocialist-anarchist I.W.W. (Industrial Workers of the World). In 1917 headvocated the Bolshevik revolution.Crowley followed his declaration of intention to hear Larkin, with afascinating, nuanced “confession.”Of course, as a man I am an Irish rebel of the most virulent type, and I want tosee every Englishman killed before my eyes: I would ship the English women toGermany, as I don’t like Germans either. But, of course, speaking as a man ofthe world, I am a reactionary Tory of the most bigoted type, although apro-Boer; that is to say, my objection to the Boer War was the depreciation ofproperty which it caused. I quite understand your [Cowie’s] attitude, but itappears to me quite absurd. You have tried to judge the matter on generalprinciples, without prejudice, and you have consequently no business to meddlewith politics, which is entirely dishonest.Yours fraternally,A. C.9 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt117]Looking through the fog of ironic humor and self-denigration, we can I think seewhere Crowley’s emotional sympathies lay, qualified by sophisticated awarenessof the facts of the real world and a rare ability to see beyond any entrenchedposition, however attractive at the purely personal or reactionary level. Forthe “Master of the Temple,” a revolution that failed to get to the absolute rootof the problem of Man would only serve to show how far from that root most mindsare. And because politics is essentially dishonest, then they can offer no pathto enlightenment, save the melancholy lessons of bitter experience. The “freedomof Man” for Crowley meant going beyond what Man was thought to be. While as aman Crowley’s passions could be characterized in the symbol of the Jacobiterebel—Chevalier O’Rourke!—such passions were symbolic, conditional, and relativeto essential spiritual attainment.JOHN QUINNThere are currently two schools of thought regarding Aleister Crowley’srelations with John Quinn, one of the most powerful and well-connected corporatelawyers and patrons of modern art and the Irish Literary Revival, in America.First, that of Richard B. Spence, adumbrated in Secret Agent 666, wherein Quinnis a moderate, pro-Irish Home Rule asset to the British consulate, WhitehallStreet, New York, in which service, according to Spence, Quinn took care ofCrowley, virtually on arrival from England on Halloween 1914, providing moneyand connections as part of Quinn’s ser-vices to the Allies in the conflict withGermany, not out of any personal admiration for Crowley. Their relations arepresented as cordial, business-like, but with little or no sign of empathybetween the two men, and not thought to extend much beyond 1915.Quinn also offered hospitality to Irish radical Sir Roger Casement, who botheredQuinn in that Casement’s rejection of Home Rule in favor of armed rebellion forcomplete Irish independence appeared to Quinn and his friend John Butler Yeats(who followed Quinn’s lead) to be based on an emotional hatred of the British,exacerbated by signs of instability. That Quinn relayed information aboutCasement to British intelligence contacts at the consulate is inferred by Spencefrom British recognition of Quinn as one of the staunchest supporters of theAllied cause among Irish-American leaders for the duration of the war.image [images/9781620556313_022.jpg]Fig. 8.4. John Quinn (1870–1924)The second line on Quinn derives from published correspondence between JohnQuinn, John Butler Yeats, and the latter’s son, W. B. Yeats, chiefly asinterpreted by William M. Murphy’s Prodigal Father, The Life of John ButlerYeats (1839–1922). Murphy’s book demonstrates the vagaries of the occasionallyvolatile Quinn’s relations with the often difficult Yeatses, painter and poet,father and son. Its lens on Crowley is that perceptible from the aforementionedcorrespondence, which provides the focus. Because all three men were very fondof Jeanne Robert Foster (and she of them), it is not surprising that once Murphycontrasts this warmth with Crowley’s well-established reputation—mud hardenedinto stone by 1978 when Murphy’s book was published—then Crowley must be thevillain of the piece, a dangerous interloper upon a nice, even cozy artisticscene, with Crowley the unsavory outsider with whom Quinn had inadvertently comeinto contact.At one point Murphy feels at liberty to describe Crowley as physically ugly;why, I cannot properly tell, though the archetypal bogeyman might have somethingto do with it. W. B. Yeats, a now longstanding enemy of Crowley’s, having heardthat Quinn and his father shared a Christmas dinner with Crowley in December1914, wrote to both his father and to Quinn. Despite the fact that Yeats seniorhad enjoyed the occasion and found Crowley a witty, “formidable” man—albeitemotionally isolated from those who laughed at his dominant, self-reflexiverepartee—Yeats attempted to warn them off a man he accused of having appallingsexual morals and who had only written the odd decent line of poetry amid anocean of uninspired verbiage. He said he did not “appreciate” Crowley andrelated a story he claimed to have troubled himself to garner from Cambridge,wherein a porter, allegedly, had once had to manhandle a struggling Crowley outof Trinity’s dining hall on account of his obscene humor. As if questioningQuinn’s ability to make the right assessment, Yeats said Crowley was the“English and French” type, which type was unknown to Quinn’s New Yorkexperience, and not to be entertained. To rub it in, Yeats also mentioned thatCrowley had once been a “handsome fellow.” This all added up to plain characterassassination perpetrated by a former practitioner of what W. B. Yeats himselffamously pronounced “dyahbolism” within a closed, friendly circle that Quinn, inparticular, valued highly.To John Butler Yeats’s recollection, Crowley impressed by erudition, though hefelt that while the big man’s mastery betrayed an aloofness that created a spacearound him, that same attribute rendered him a natural center of attention, witha curious attraction. Quinn’s response to W. B. Yeats’s entreaty that Crowley beshunned appears, by contrast, defensive.Quinn professed a cool indifference, somewhat forced: Crowley might be a good orbad magician; Quinn did not care. He could see no obvious moral defect, saveindulgence in wine. Denying Crowley any distinction as a poet—he wasn’t going tocontend with the great W. B. Yeats where that was concerned!—Quinn thoughtCrowley out of place in New York, even implying to Yeats that he had nopersonality! Quinn insisted he had neither interest nor personal tolerance ofmagic. Crowley’s pet subject was a bore to him. Doubtless concerned with hisreputation for advanced good taste, Quinn added that while the man had writtenmuch, his works were not popular—this from a man who personally backed theArmory avantgarde show in 1913, the same year he purchased Crowley’s more outréworks! Quinn maintained that Yeats shouldn’t be concerned, for he was not “in”with Crowley, nor had he any intention of being so. The implication may be thatQuinn had reasons not to explain his indulging Crowley at his house; thequestion then would be: What were those reasons?It might be observed that if Quinn felt as negative toward Crowley as hesuggested to Yeats, why had he ever invited him to his house in the first place?Well, he was a warmhearted fellow, no doubt. But why pay good money (Crowleysays $700 in November 1914) for Crowley’s works? Did Quinn suspect that theymight appreciate? And what made him so defensive in the face of W. B. Yeats’sconcerns?Spence was aware that on arriving in New York, Crowley’s autobiography statedthat after an “addled” business deal, the only thing that kept him in New York,in the first instance, was to oversee delivery to Quinn of a profitable quantityof fine editions and manuscripts of his work and to pick up the cash insettlement before returning to England. This may seem very odd if Quinn was, ashe maintained to W. B. Yeats, one who regarded Crowley’s poetry asinconsequential.*58 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft58] Spence naturally, given hisfocus on events, sees this buying-books episode as basically a cover to explaincontact with Crowley, with the added inference that Yeats’s unexpected (?)attack on Crowley had somehow rendered Crowley’s cover a little less plausible,thus putting Quinn on the back foot. It should be emphasized that Yeats’s fatherrather liked Sir Roger Casement (who, after meeting JBY and Quinn, had gone toBerlin to organize German assistance in exchange for an Irish rebellion againstwartime Britain). Unlike Quinn, W. B. Yeats cared very little indeed for theAllied cause and simply yearned for Irish independence.His father, John Butler Yeats, had informed Quinn shortly after Britain declaredwar in August that he would not personally mind if Britain was brought down apeg or two by Germany, even though he couldn’t stand German militarism.According to Murphy, J. B. Yeats began to move his politics more in line withQuinn’s as the weeks drew on; that is, support for the Allies in the name ofcivilization. By the end of the war, Quinn would express his disappointment withW. B. Yeats for never having written anything expressly positive to support theAllies, in which service Quinn had himself given much time, energy, and money.The fact is that John Quinn had been in contact with Crowley’s organization inLondon since 1913, and from that contact, he would already have known quite wellwhat he was dealing with.John Quinn was a devoted collector of manuscripts, books, and artifacts ofmodern art, with a particular interest in Irish politics and in new Irish workif of a high standard. That is what had first brought the Yeatses into theIrish-American Quinn’s orbit around 1907, and vice versa. In 1913, it seems,someone or something had alerted Quinn to the high-quality publishing exploitsof Aleister Crowley, whose Collected Works described their author as an Irishmanwho ran a countercultural (an anachronism, but accurate) publishing enterpriseout of his Equinox magazine offices at 124 Victoria Street, London, that tradedunder the name E. J. Wieland & Co., after Aimage [images/dots.jpg]Aimage[images/dots.jpg] member E. J. Wieland, husband of Equinox contributing writerEthel Archer, and who paid his subs to the Order by working for Crowley and,presumably, taking a cut of profits, if there were any.Neither Spence nor Murphy’s work shows awareness of Quinn’s prewar contact withCrowley. Crowley had just returned from an intense sojourn in Moscow when onSeptember 1, 1913, he entered his office to find four letters waiting for himfrom John Quinn.10 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt118] Judging by Crowley’s reply,confirmed by a passage in the Confessions, Quinn was particularly interested inpurchasing two works that Crowley described in the latter work as“introuvables”; that is, works difficult to obtain. The reason why the workswere somewhat rare, and highly collectible, was that they were both works ofdecadent, satirical irony involving explicit sexual references of a deliberatelyshocking nature, at least by the mores of the time. In the argot and mind of thegutter, they might be termed “dirty books.” Quinn was obviously intrigued toknow more about their contents.In his reply, Crowley explained to Quinn that White Stains, attributed to a“Neuropath of the Second Empire,” despite all appearances, was in fact a seriousrebuttal to Richard von Krafft-Ebing’s notorious investigation of sexualscience, Psychopathia Sexualis. Crowley says that White Stains was written todemonstrate that it was psychological, not pathological, disease that causedsexual crises. In other words, state of mind was critical. People with peculiarsexual proclivities were not necessarily sick, though lack of understanding oftheir psychology could cause breakdown of health. Crowley was quite frank thatthe treatise on “Persian piety” that went under the name of the Bagh-i-Muattar,allegedly taken from a manuscript transcribed by a “Major Lutiy,” and somethingof a gay parody of Sir Richard Burton’s Eastern erotica, dealt with “paederasty,of which the author [Crowley] saw much evidence in India. It is an attempt tounderstand the mind of the Persian.” Yes, of course. It is a play on buggerypeppered with homosexual euphemisms and double entendres and testifies to theera’s general obsession with sex; Crowley wanted to lance the boil, and got akick out of doing so.An even earlier letter from Wieland & Co. to Quinn survives in the YorkeCollection of the Warburg Institute. Addressed to Quinn at 31 Nassau Street, NewYork City, it refers to a letter sent to Quinn on February 12, 1913, which thelatter had not answered.We cannot keep this parcel and must ask you to let us know your decision atonce, as this offer can never be repeated. It has meant the labour of months toget together so complete a set of books.We are now able to supply the New Year’s card which we have obtained with theutmost difficulty, as it was sent out more than ten years ago to persons whosenames and addresses are now lost. Similar remarks apply to many of the smalleritems.11 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt119]Furthermore, we must admit some mystery in the relations between Crowley andQuinn, for research reveals that Crowley’s relationship with Quinn extended wellbeyond the period referred to either by Spence or by Londraville’s biography ofJeanne Robert Foster. Quinn’s phone number appears on Crowley’s address listfrom 1917,12 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt120] while written con-tact extended toas late as 1919, judging from this surviving note from Crowley to Quinn, datedabout April of that year. It concerns a show-ing of Crowley’s recent paintingsthat had been earlier exhibited at the Liberal Club in Greenwich Village, whichfeatured in a number of U.S. newspapers.My dear Quinn,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.I have now got my pictures more or less ready to show you—any day will suit meas long as I know beforehand.Love is the law, love under will.Sincerely,Aleister Crowley13 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt121]Jeanne Robert Foster became John Quinn’s personal editorial assistant, anddiscreet romantic partner, in 1918. One wonders if he ever broached the subjectof his special purchases of Crowley’s condemned works with Jeanne during theyears they shared together, and, one would like to know, did he consider themart?"},{"pageContent":"PART TWO> THE FURNACE"},{"pageContent":"NINEimage [images/9781620556313_099.jpg]1914On Monday, February 9, 1914, while Victor Neuburg and Crowley successfullyinvoked Jupiter (that is, to their satisfaction) in number 21 of the “ParisWorkings,” John Quinn wrote to W. B. Yeats in Ireland, the latter preparing aNew York lecture season.1 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt122]Quinn offered to revive a personal friendship shattered five years previously in1909 when Quinn accused Yeats of trespassing onto his romantic territory. Theunmarried Quinn had at some cost established a liaison with former schoolteacherDorothy Coates. In early 1914, fearing that she might be dying, Coates urgedQuinn to make up with Yeats, of whom she was fond, though she preferred Quinn’smoney. Coates and Yeats had met in Paris in 1909, when sparks flew between them.Excited, “Willie” unwisely boasted in Dublin of his effect on the lady. Coatesplainly encouraged an amour with the poet favored by Quinn’s patronage butinsisted to her official lover that Yeats had been the emotional aggressor.2[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt123] Incensed by John Butler Yeats’s son’s conduct,Quinn had expected the younger Yeats to respect what he had paid good money tokeep his own! Reconciliation between the men after the prolonged breach finallyoccurred in March 1914, very much to John Butler Yeats’s relief.Quinn had never lost faith in Yeats the poet, and before the latter’s return toIreland, Quinn arranged for New York’s most fashionable photographer, ArnoldGenthe, to photograph himself with the poet. Not only did Quinn join himselfthereby to high Art, but he also undertook to buy regular installments ofWilliam Butler Yeats’s manuscripts on the understanding that proceeds go topaying off Yeats’s father’s debts and living expenses at the Petitpasrestaurant’s boarding rooms, from which coal-heated coziness John Butler Yeats’sfamily in Ireland could never extract him.Before William Butler Yeats returned to Dublin, Quinn gave a lavish dinner inthe poet’s honor. Guests received a specially printed edition of nine of Yeats’spoems chosen by Quinn, with another Genthe photograph of Yeats as frontispiece.Thus one can imagine that Yeats would have felt threatened on several fronts bynews in December 1914 that Quinn had entertained Aleister Crowley, who knew muchabout Yeats that it is certain Quinn himself did not know. Frequently vain andsnobbish, Yeats had every reason to revive the character assassination ofCrowley he began with letters to his patron Lady Gregory in 1900 when he took itupon himself to damn Crowley as a “quite unspeakable person.”3[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt124]It is clear that William Murphy has accepted or embellished a story of Crowleyas some kind of mercenary character, asserting, for example, that Mathers had“hired” Crowley to close down the London Temple of the Golden Dawn, possiblyconflating the Yeats/Crowley legend with the fact that it was Crowley who hireda “chucker out” from a London theater to assist him and Elaine Simpson inclosing the Blythe Road Golden Dawn premises to the London GD rebels onImperator Mathers’s instructions.4 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt125]A quiet but very determined player, Jeanne Robert Foster undoubtedly kept aclose eye on the nexus of Quinn and the Yeatses; reporting the art world was,after all, part of her job. Having at last seen William Butler Yeats lecture atthe National Arts Club in late spring 1914, and considering Yeats the mostbeautiful being she had ever seen, it took very little for Jeanne’s idealism toconflate what she saw with what she thought of his poetry. Judging from a letterof May 10, 1914, from John Butler Yeats to son “Willie,” the father had pickedup on hints Jeanne may have gushed forth in her artistic enthusiasm and conveyedby implication, I suspect, that though married, the delectable Jeanne might yetstir herself into Willie’s poetic, unmarried heart, as she had already stirredthe father’s. If nothing else, she would be an excellent contact for Willie tocultivate: Jeanne was a “young lady who writes (and writes well) all thepoetical criticism in the Review of Reviews.” The young lady already consideredhim the “only poet.” Who was she? “She is a Mrs. Foster and extraordinarilypretty,” and clever, “and though her husband is old and an invalid the mostmalicious tongues have nothing to say. . . . She says that since she was a childshe has been interested in white magic and wants very much to know something ofblack magic.” Well, here was an evident entrée for Willie!—and, of course,though Willie’s father had no thought of it, for Crowley the following year. “Itis rare,” continued Yeats’s dad, piling on the merit stars, “to find so muchreally strong intellect with kindness and affection.”5[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt126]Five days before the canny old painter penned this letter, Aleister Crowley, infinancial straits after eighteen years of one-way spending, mortgaged hisScottish property, Boleskine House, by Loch Ness, to be administered by GeorgeMacnie Cowie, treasurer of the British branch of the Ordo Templi Orientis.Crowley might have been watching the pennies, or getting someone else to, but hefelt in full flush of health, attributed in part to the experimental sex magickfor Jovian health undertaken in January and February in Paris. Crowley hadmountaineering on his mind and made exploratory plans for a return either to K2or Kangchenjunga. Exactly eight years after trying to sell the idea in New York,he made a memorandum to contact the India Office, Fortnum & Mason (Londonsuppliers), King George V, Oscar Eckenstein, the Hon. Everard Feilding, GuyKnowles (who had footed much of the bill for the earlier expedition), financialjournalist Raymond Radclyffe, Guy Marston of the Royal Navy, the specialist bootdesigner Lawrie, and someone called “Bullock.”*59 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft59]Preparation for a projected 1915 Himalayan adventure perhaps explains why inJuly he went, apparently alone, to the Alps. He also returned to North Africa,where he wrote an effective poem, “The Tent,” about the “Love of God.” Crowleywas certainly hurt that Victor Neuburg, his partner in both the Paris Workingsand his last North African adventures (1909), had quit his master in occultstudies of many years, determined to go his own, nonoccult way. In summer 1914,Crowley ascended all of the 11,371 feet of the Jungfrau in the Bernese Alpsalone to encourage, he said in his Confessions, younger climbers to ignore theunmanly recommendations of the Alpine Club. As to what else Crowley may havebeen getting up to we are chiefly reliant on Crowley’s autobiographical accountalone, bar an important affidavit Crowley submitted in 1917 to explain to theU.S. Department of Justice how he came to be active in espionage against Germaninterests in the United States. 1. I was in Switzerland on Aug. 1, 1914, and returned at once to England. 2. I offered myself to the Government, and hoped to get a commission through the good offices of my friend Lieut. The Hon. Everard Feilding, R.N.V.R. [Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]. 3. In September I was attacked by phlebitis, which bars me permanently from active service.6 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt27]This line was consistently held by Crowley throughout his life, with only oneadditional detail. In an approving, illustrated article about his paintingpublished by the Syracuse Herald, New York, on March 9, 1919 (possibly the storythat alerted Quinn to Crowley’s art), the writer asserted that “Mr. Crowley isan Englishman who at the outbreak of the Great War was in the confidentialservice of the British government. In this service he was shot in the leg, hesays.” We may be inclined to take this as a remarkable explanation for thephlebitis that undoubtedly seriously afflicted him September to November 1914and that gave him a limp for a considerable time afterward. But the news storydoes not itself make that link and, standing alone, must be regarded as being ofquestionable value historically. He may have been thinking of the word shot in aquasi-surreal context, as his 1914 diary reveals the phlebitis condition wasdangerously enflamed after an experiment of sexual magick with a prostitute toimprove his health. The things I do for England . . .On August 1, three days before hostilities between Great Britain and Germanywere declared, Jeanne Robert Foster landed in England while Americans in Londonand Paris fought to get back to America. She recalled events more than fiftyyears later in conversation with Richard Londraville. “I spent much time withthe Straus American Committee in London and managed with my credentials, to seethe troop movements on Salisbury Plain, ride troop trains about, and send manypictures back to New York.”7 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt128]When war wasdeclared, “It was gay—one might have thought a holiday declared instead of war.”Jeanne saw the crowds gather at Buckingham Palace, greeted by the king and queenon the palace balcony. The next day she observed what Crowley would in duecourse complain about. Jeanne was shocked when confronted by “a startlingposter” in John Bull—a jingoistic rag run by Horatio Bottomley, MP, which afterthe war accused Crowley of treachery to his country—declaring, “To Hell withSerbia!” In Crowley’s postwar account of his wartime activities (“The LastStraw”), written as a rebuttal to Bottomley, he found the Bottomley approachendemic in British propaganda—“fighting à la fishwife,” as he called it, onaccount of the foul-mouthed abuse hurled at an allegedly inhuman enemy.Jeanne felt completely caught up in events, confiding to her diary on August 15,1914, “One seemed before to live outside history: suddenly history is in themaking everywhere.”8 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt129] What is particularlyinteresting is that Jeanne offered her resignation to Albert Shaw at the Reviewof Reviews so as “to help as well as she could with the war effort.”9[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt130] The war effort was Britain’s war effort, andJeanne was American, ostensibly an observer from an officially neutral country.Shaw did not accept Jeanne’s resignation, advising her to do as she wished butto submit material to the magazine when she could. Jeanne “used her press passto go where most women were not allowed.”10 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt131] Thisdetail is not explained in Londraville’s biography of Jeanne Robert Foster.Jeanne had obviously developed an attachment to Great Britain. Part of the storyabout her told in local history in the Adirondacks today is that during the warJeanne was a “secret Correspondent.” The source of the story was likely Jeanneherself. Spence suspected that Jeanne might have eventually returned to New Yorkas a British intelligence asset, working with the British consulate. He evensuggests that she might have been given the task of keeping an eye onunpredictable “asset” Aleister Crowley. Certainly, her remarkable access toBritish military maneuvers is quite extraordinary, except in the framework of aBritish propaganda and diplomatic effort.Jeanne dispatched many pictures of the British mobilization to New York. In onetouching story recalled by Jeanne, she was asked by volunteer soldiers gatheredin London’s Hyde Park to photograph them. The images are immensely moving:fresh, warm-faced young men in clean uniforms relaxing informally on the summerygrass. She sent copies of the developed pictures to the men’s regiments inFrance not long afterward. They were all returned. The fresh, warm faces of theyoung men relaxing on the grass of sunkissed Hyde Park were all dead. Thismemory must have had some effect on her when Crowley felt that he had tomaintain, as he would, to Jeanne the following year, that he would, if calledupon to choose, fight in a German trench. Crowley’s acutely painful reticencewas, he confessed, because Albert Shaw’s literary magazine had a distinctlypro-German slant. This is arguably the case, as we shall see. If Jeanne wasworking for the Allies, it is unlikely she informed Crowley of the fact, asindeed, vice versa. However, the story Crowley told must also cast doubt onSpence’s suggestion that she was requested to “mind” Crowley (otherwise whyshould she quiz him on his real loyalties?), unless of course she was not toldthat he might be a British asset himself, which, of course, complicates thescenario still further! One is inclined to reach for Ockham’s razor.That Jeanne was involved with secret information at some level is stronglysuggested by her passing reminiscence concerning fears about returning on aBritish ship to the United States in the light of German determination to sinkAllied shipping. She mentioned to Londraville that shortly before departing sheheard that the passenger ship SS Belgray had sailed from New York carrying warsupplies to a secret destination.11 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt132] How couldshe have learned this confidential fact if her safety was not of interest toBritish security? In any event, “Jeanne R. Foster,” aged twenty-nine, giving herNew York address as the National Arts Club, left Glasgow on September 19, 1914,aboard SS Columbia, docking safely in New York on September 28, a month beforeCrowley’s own return to Gotham."},{"pageContent":"TENimage [images/9781620556313_099.jpg]The Sinews of WarTo understand Crowley’s curious positioning and repositioning during the firstsix months of World War I, it is only necessary to grasp the two main issuesthat dominated British and American government thinking with regard to oneanother during this period and whose resolutions shaped future policy betweenthe nations. As will be shown, Crowley understood both issues with crystallineclarity and acted on his conclusions with vigor.The first issue was the immediate British need for additional money and matérielto expand its military and industrial war provision so as to prosecute all-outwar with Germany effectively. The second issue was the role played by activepro-German propaganda in America in frustrating resolution of the first issue.In face of competition and strong opposition, Britain had to secure hefty loansand credits from American banks, and so did Germany.The initial problem for both warring countries was that America was officiallyneutral. For U.S. government figures like Secretary of State William JenningsBryan (1860–1925), neutrality meant that Americans should not participate inloans or sell munitions to warring parties. In the war’s first months, Bryanupheld this prohibition as a principle of government, encouraging PresidentWoodrow Wilson to play mediator, a role compromised by favor shown to anyparticular side in the conflict. John Quinn, for one, considered Bryan idioticon the issue. Wilson had to listen to public opinion, which was of coursedivided. The interests of commerce and capital, which desired to profit from thewar, had loud voices, and in State Department Counselor Robert Lansing theyfound a determined spokesman for the economic case of selling war supplies tobelligerents.German government meanwhile, intensely irritated by the American media’swidespread sympathy to the Allied cause, quickly perceived that the Allies hadmost to gain from American liberty to sell, and therefore galvanized theirpropaganda effort to demand strict neutrality from the United States as regardsloans and matériel. Propaganda in America was not therefore a minor policysideline either to the Germans or to the Allies; German propaganda was on theforefront of British intelligence concern with regard to America. With Germanpropaganda in the States went German spying in the States. German exasperationover what it came to perceive as hostile anti-German U.S. policy (permittingloans and arms sales) would lead to precipitous acts of espionage and massdestruction that opened the road to America’s finally entering the war. As willbecome clear, Crowley played a role in unbalancing the formerly fine-tunedGerman propaganda effort, but that is to jump ahead.If we keep in mind the formidable tensions outlined above, we shall avoid theoccasional bouts of confusion that sometimes left Crowley himself reeling,partially overwhelmed by the complexity of events and forces in which he choseto involve himself. We must also recognize that Crowley’s priorities alwaysincluded long-term spiritual and magical obligations, as he became aware ofthem; for Crowley, the war was one symbol of the New Aeon’s birth—it was aboutfreedom, and the resistance of the old establishments to it.GERMANS COME SHOPPINGThe Germans were quick off the mark. Within a fortnight of war being declaredbetween Great Britain and Germany, two senior German bankers crossed theAtlantic into the heat of mid-August New York. Armed with Kaiser Wilhelm’sblessing, Max Warburg, head of the MM Warburg Bank of Hamburg, and BernhardDernburg brought $175 million in treasury certificates to market. Warburg hadhis connections. Brothers Paul and Felix were partners in Kuhn, Loeb & Co.Company patriarch Jacob Schiff was Felix’s father-in-law. Schiff was happy tooblige his relative from the fatherland but realized adequate funds necessitatedcooperation from J. P. Morgan & Co. at 23 Wall Street. Wall Street is not abrick wall, but it can act like one. Pro-Allied Morgan wanted nothing to do withfunding Germany’s war effort; rather, Morgan preferred to undermine it.In this, Morgan, and British intelligence, enjoyed the generous services of amost useful asset. Investment banker, collector, philanthropist, savior ofAmerican railroad finance, and naturalized British subject Otto Hermann Kahn(1867–1934) had joined Kuhn, Loeb & Co. in 1896 when Kahn’s father-in-law,Abraham Wolff, was a partner. According to senior New York–based British SecretIntelligence Services officer Norman Thwaites, Kahn was “whole-heartedlypro-Allied and especially pro-British.”1 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt133] AndKahn’s name crops up regularly in Crowley’s wartime and postwar writings as afriend. Crowley even fictionalized Kahn as “Paul Powys” in his “Simon Iff”detective story Nebuchadnezzar, written in 1917. Crowley almost gives the gameaway in his account of Powys’s enemy “Kuhn.”Kuhn, in particular, was noted for his sly secretive methods. He was called“Pussy” on the Street [Wall Street]. Arnheim was of a more obvious type; he wasassociated with Kuhn in many great enterprises. Next to Paul Powys [Kahn], therewas no financier in New York City so dreaded as Theophilus Kuhn; and there hadbeen great enmity between them. With Arnheim’s assistance Kuhn stood a fairchance of pulling down the great little Welshman [Powys]; indeed, he had alwaysheld his own, and come out of many a battle with not too unfavourable a draw.But Powys was master of a power not his own; he represented the conservativeelement, and could always rally the forces of sanity to his banner.2[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt134]According to Crowley’s “Affidavit” prepared specifically to explain pastactivities to the U.S. Department of Justice and uninformed Allied authoritiesin 1917, it was Otto Kahn who personally advised Crowley how best to approachBritish intelligence in New York.8. I wrote to Capt. Guy Gaunt, RN [British naval attaché, Naval IntelligenceDepartment, New York] from Washington early in 1916, when the Fatherland[pro-German propaganda magazine] was attacking him personally for “bribing theoffice boy” etc.,*60 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft60] a letter of sympathy and anoffer of help and service. Captain Gaunt replied cordially, but as if theFatherland were not worth notice.9. After a conversation with Mr. Otto H. Kahn, I applied to Captain Gauntformally for work in connection with (a) the Fatherland (b) Irish-Americanagitation (c) Indian revolutionary activity. I have ever since kept him informedof my address, so as to be ready if called. Not hearing from him, I also spoketo Mr. Willert of Washington, D.C.3 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt135] on thismatter, on the advice of my friend Mr. Paul Wayland Bartlett.4[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt136]Crowley’s acquaintance with Kahn extended beyond the war. When in 1923experienced journalist Frank Harris and Crowley attempted purchase of the ParisTelegram newspaper, “my friend Otto Kahn”5 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt137] waswilling to advance funds to a deal apparently wrecked by Harris’sinflexibility.*61 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft61] And in the wake of persecutionby hostile British tabloids, assis-tant Norman Mudd wrote to Kahn in 1924 forwritten confirmation of Crowley’s defense of his U.S. activities; Kahn replied.Curiously, when I recently went to inspect Kahn’s reply, this letter alone haddisappeared from its file at the Warburg Institute.Disappointed with their banking mission, Max Warburg returned to Germany, butBernhard Dernburg remained in New York to supervise the German InformationBureau on Broadway and to front the Germans’ secretive “Propaganda Kabinett.”7[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt139]MEANWHILE IN LONDON . . .Crowley was always indignant that on returning from Switzerland and Paris to awar-enflamed hysteria in London, none of his efforts to find governmentemployment in his country’s service bore fruit, at least not immediately.I was more than ever convinced that I was needed by my country, which isEngland, and to hell with everybody. In my excitement, I had the hallucinationthat England needed men. I found, on the contrary, that the guiding stars ofEngland needed “business as usual.”8 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt140]Records prove that Crowley, despite confinement to bed with phlebitis ondoctor’s orders in September and October, showed systematic constructive supportfor the Allied cause. He did this chiefly through his position as literarycritic, essayist, and contributing poet to the English Review in full andfrustrating knowledge that other British literary figures, such as G.K. Chesterton, Somerset Maugham, Arnold Bennett, and H. G. Wells, were findingemployment in propaganda and intelligence services. Crowley saw the war as anopportunity for an exceptionally well-traveled, virile man with linguistic andcross-cultural knowledge and experience to do brave and important things.True to form, he kicked off his campaign with ten specially written patrioticpoems, three of which appeared in the English Review’s August edition under thetitle “Chants before Battle.”9 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt141] Crowley’s poemsparodied English styles from Chaucer to modern times and included his take onthe 1878 hit “Jingo War Song,” whose chorus—“We don’t want to fight but by jingoif we do, / We’ve got the ships, we’ve got the men, and got the moneytoo!”—brought the word jingoism into the English language. Crowley eschewed themumbo-jingo and made the refrain more threatening and serious. “We don’t want tofight, but if we do . . .” If we do—giving the hanging phrase “if we do” kindredresonance to Kipling’s haunting “Lest we forget . . .” Crowley himself wasdoubtful that England did have the money she needed.Editor Austin Harrison presented Crowley’s poems amid works by SiegfriedSassoon, John Masefield, and war poetry by serving men. South Australian journalthe Register (October 3, 1914) commended to its readers the “August issue of theEnglish Review, which continues to present excellent value for a shilling.Aleister Crowley contributes a series of ingenious ‘Chants Before Battle,’ inimitation of various poets.”On September 27, the Observer printed Crowley’s letter suggesting how Germanymight, in defeat, make reparation for barbaric destruction wrought by its armyin Belgium and France.Sir,Poetic justice to Rheims is possible. It is well within the power of modernbuilders to transplant thither Cologne Cathedral, stone by numbered stone. Letthis be the symbol and monument of our victory.Yours faithfully,Aleister Crowley33, Avenue Studios,South Kensington, S.W., Sept. 22In November, with its author now in New York, the English Review republishedCrowley’s 1899 “Appeal to the American Republic,” calling on America with freshmeaning to join hands across the water with Great Britain—done with only asingle additional consonant: the “traitor Russian” became in the newcircumstances “the traitor Prussian.” For the poet, the timely reissue was bothsymbolic, and, as it turned out, prophetic.In quest of official employment, Crowley approached his older friend theHonorable Francis Henry Everard Joseph Feilding, former secretary of thePsychical Research Society, fellow graduate of Trinity, Cambridge (1890), son ofRandolph Feilding, Earl of Denbigh. Feilding would play a key role in Crowley’speculiar, attested wartime intelligence activities. Feilding’s uncle, ColonelWilliam Feilding (Coldstream Guards), had also served military intelligence,reported directly to Prime Minister Disraeli, and was given his own secretservice department to undermine escalating Fenian violence in Ireland andelsewhere between 1864 and 1867. Crowley’s friend Commander Guy Marston of theRoyal Navy was one of the top half-dozen Admiralty officials handlingintelligence during the Great War.*62 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft62]A very young midshipman in the Egyptian Campaign of 1882, Feilding was called tothe bar in 1894. Being a barrister, and lieutenant in the Royal Naval VolunteerReserve, Feilding qualified for wartime appointment to the Committee of NavalCensors (press bureau): a proper port of call for Crowley’s ambition to serve.Feilding would in due course be transferred to the Special IntelligenceDepartment of Egypt, which lent him to the new “Arab Bureau” (which T. E.Lawrence—“Lawrence of Arabia”—served), based in Cairo, and to the foreign officefor political service in Syria. For his pains Feilding would receive the OBE,the Order of the Nile, and the Order of El Nahda from the Emir of the Hedjaz.10[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt142] Crowley could only have dreamed of such honors.According to Crowley, Feilding told the Beast that if he desired a governmentappointment he would have better obtained a service commission and not developedsuch a mixed reputation for strange, unpredictable behavior, poses, andinterests. Past service to Carlists and following his muse into any number ofyouthful and mature indiscretions would not open doors to British militaryintelligence. “But what about propaganda?” pleaded Crowley: something heunderstood perfectly. “Psychology . . . special knowledge . . .” It was no good.Crowley’s reputation was apparently too colorful, too difficult to place. Thatwas the story: Crowley presented more problems than he might appear to solve.One can imagine the conversation, if it happened that way. Crowley says that hecould not understand it. The country was in peril, and his gifts were being castaside at the very time the country most needed them. Surely Feilding himself haddone odd things: studied psychical phenomena all over Europe, investigatingmedium Eusapia Palladino and Madame Blavatsky’s “hidden masters,” for a start.Ah, retorted Feilding, “I have a locus standi”; that is, a foot in the services.Crowley had crossed China, India, the Algerian desert, Mexico, the UnitedStates; explored Russia; scaled the highest peaks from the Alps to theKarakorams; handled weapons; led men; kept secrets; made himself invisible;confronted death, destruction, and the demon “Choronzon,” and what had Fieldingto trump his ace in 1914? Time spent on a naval training ship, legal expertise,and a post in the censor’s office! As Crowley put it years later, “My leg and mySunday School record alike conspiring to keep me out of the trenches, and mydeplorable lack of stupidity disqualifying me for the Intelligence Department, Iaccepted an invitation to go to New York . . .”11[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt143]Just how and why Crowley got to New York at the end of October 1914 we must nowinvestigate.CAP IN HAND, TO THE SAVAGES FOR COWRIESMystery has always surrounded precisely what it was that Crowley was doing whenhe boarded the Lusitania for New York on October 24, 1914. Now, I think, we canmake more than an educated guess. Crowley himself gives clues in hisConfessions.An invitation to New York was potentially profitable. “It looked as though theremight be fifteen or twenty million dollars in it, and I had a feeling that mycountry, the richest in the world, would shortly be going, cap in hand, to thesavages for cowries. I went to America by the Lusitania, on October 24th, 1914,expecting to stay a fortnight and return with the sinews of war.”12[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt144] The reference to the “sinews of war” alerts usimmediately to historical context: this was about raising capital, loans, andcredits to pay for war matériel. It was certainly not fifteen to twenty milliondollars for Crowley himself! Later in the Confessions he reveals that he hadexpected a “little splash”—that is, a commission—for his part in the business:sufficient to more than reimburse expenses incurred. The reference to “cowries”exhibits Crowley’s usual cynicism about the affairs of officialdom. Cowrieshells were used as currency in West Africa and the Indian Ocean to the middleof the nineteenth century. Crowley was expressing a patrician disdain for thedominant role of banks in war: slavers used cowries to pay for slaves—the priceof blood. He “had a feeling,” he writes, that Britain would soon be going toAmerica for finance; he knew damned well what was going on. “I had intended,when I left England, to conclude my special business in New York within afortnight, to make a little splash in any case, and to get home in a month onthe outside.”13 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt145]We may wonder what had suddenly led to a situation whereby a controversialoccult scholar, poet, mountaineer, and traveler could have assisted alarge-scale mercantile war interest. Crowley does not seem surprised, because hetook his usefulness for granted. In fact, the territory was familiar to him. Hedid not live his life in an occult bubble, though he would retire into it fromtime to time.The answer may be found in a singular paragraph of the Confessions. In it,Crowley gives the impression he was prophetically advocating opinions about therunning of the war of unique inspiration.At that time any man who suggested the advisability of conscription was regardedas a traitor. Conscription was the very thing we were fighting. Austin Harrisonsaid that we were fighting for our golf and our weekends, Raymond Radclyffe saidwith, as it seemed to me, some-what more plausibility that if we beat theGermans, it showed that the amateur was better than the professional.14[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt146]Though the line is somewhat disingenuous, it reveals the vital parties:prominent journalists Austin Harrison and Raymond Radclyffe, from which leads wemay deduce that the stimulus to Crowley’s financial gambit in New York came outof discussions at the English Review. While an impression might have beenconveyed that the Review was devoted to poetry, its contents were mostlynonfiction.Until 1908, Austin Harrison had edited Lord Northcliffe’s broadsheet of note theObserver. There Harrison pursued a longstanding concern with the threat posed bythe Kaiser to the British Empire and world peace. Harrison had quit Reuters in1904 due to German Foreign Ministry restrictions, whereupon he wrote ThePan-Germanic Doctrine (1904) to highlight impending crisis with Germany. SoCrowley’s Confessions account understates Harrison’s commitment to the cause,possibly to enhance his own. The English Review would carry Austin Harrison’sseries of articles advocating conscription as an urgent necessity to defeat theGerman war machine in summer 1915, possibly influenced by discussions theprevious year and subsequently with Raymond Radclyffe and the not uniquelyoutspoken Crowley. According to historian Ann-Marie Einhaus, the English Reviewwas very critical of government preparedness for financing the war.15[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt147] Thus in autumn 1914, Crowley found himself onthe vanguard of critics of government war policy.image [images/9781620556313_023.jpg]Fig. 10.1. The English Review, June 1914. Edited by Austin Harrison, June’sedition contained work by D. H. Lawrence (“Vin Ordinaire”), Norman Douglas, andAleister Crowley (short story, “The Stratagem,”) praised by Joseph Conrad.His Confessions account, however, presents his plaint as one of the unheeded“voice crying in the wilderness” type. “From my sick bed,” wrote Crowley, layingit on a bit thick (he had phlebitis), “I dictated an article called ‘Thorough’in allusion to the plan of the Earl of Strafford in the time of Charles theFirst [1641]. I said, ‘commandeer every man and every munition in the country.’I said, ‘This is not a continental quarrel—this is life and death for England.We don’t want debates in the House of Commons, or even in Earlswood asylum.*63[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft63] We want a dictator.’” No editor would publish it.While wagging a finger at Harrison for not being, in his opinion, quick enoughoff the mark, it is clear that Harrison would have sympathized. Perhaps Harrisonrecognized that the piece needed toning down, especially after the reaction toCrowley’s controversial “Art in America” article a year previously. Spurred byhis own strain of war fever, exacerbated by phlebitis, Crowley was indignant andimpatient to get on, and get in.It seems highly likely that the “way out” of Crowley’s dilemma came throughRaymond Radclyffe. Radclyffe was responsible for the English Review’s financialsection. He was a highly respected financial journalist, operating within amatrix of high-placed commercial networks, with his fingers on the pulse ofgovernment economic policy. Indeed, Austin Harrison had poached Radclyffe fromLondon’s Financial Times. Radclyffe’s exploratory tour and assessment ofAustralia’s mines established him as the sought-after expert in financing thisever-lucrative field of commercial exploration. Critically, Raymond Radclyffehad just written the influential, controversial pamphlet The War and Finance:How to Save the Situation.16 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt148] I would imagine thepublication of that work stimulated a concerned hand into action, and Radclyffe,knowing of, and sympathetic to, Crowley’s frustration to be useful, recommendedhim. Raymond Radclyffe was Crowley’s longstanding friend.image [images/9781620556313_024.jpg]Fig. 10.2. Raymond Radclyffe’s copy of Crowley’s Works (1905). Crowley gave itto Sunday Dispatch editor, writer and broadcaster Collin Brooks (1893–1959) onMay 26, 1942, inscribing it: “I am sad, for he [Radclyffe] was one of the verybest that ever lived; a City Editor straight as Euclid before Einstein attackedhim, and one of the best literary critics and friends in the world. But now I amglad, for Collin Brooks to whom I give this copy (which is not mine to give) hasrestored me to that ‘too much love of living’ which I thought I had parted from.Aleister Crowley 26-5-42 EV.” (Photo: Peter Harrington, Bookseller)A series of extant letters at the Warburg charts the early period of theirfriendship.17 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt149] On April 10, 1909, Crowley sent apostcard, postmarked Orléans, France, to Radclyffe, then living at the ruralvillage address of The Lines, Abbey Road, Bourne End, Buckinghamshire.I am sorry not to have written earlier to thank you for the kind invitation. . ..London will again rejoice at my presence (I hope) on Wednesday or Thursday, andmay the Gods grant it!—I should like to see you, and get you to meet Fuller[Captain J. F. C.

I’m weekending at Brighton; but will hope tosee you Monday at lunch. I’m writing Fuller*64 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft64]Let it be Imperial Grill 1:30 as usual, if you will.†65[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft65]No more; I’m wallowing in work.Yours,Aleister CrowleyFrom an apartment at 21 Warwick Road, Earls Court, shared with wife, Rose, anddaughter, Lola, Crowley wrote again in 1909 to Radclyffe, now moved to GolfView, Flackwell Heath, Buckinghamshire.All right. Thursday 18th. Will Imperial Grill suit you? . . . The Equinox hasgone to the binders; I am free from it for ten days, Thank God!Yours,Aleister CrowleyCrowley used his Equinox office postcard at 124 Victoria Street to write Mrs.Radclyffe on March 29, 1910, a letter testifying to the familiarity of Crowleyand the Radclyffes; he had given Mrs. Radclyffe a thank-you present.Dear Mrs. Radclyffe,Not easily shall I forget your kindness at Easter: I enjoyed myself as is rarelypossible for one of my melancholy temperament, and was so fortified by your goodcounsel that I am proud to be able to say that (though hard put to it) I amstill NOT engaged.*66 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft66]If you attach the Buddha to your neck by a string of Electrum Magicum and sayAum Mani Padme Hum 111 times in the right tone of voice when addressing yourball [crystal?], you will never again miss a fault.Yours very truly,Aleister CrowleyFive months later, Mr. Radclyffe would write a glowing, aesthetically responsivereport for the Sketch (a “journal of art and actuality” featuring fashion,society, art, theater, glamour, royalty, golf, etc.) of Crowley’s Rites ofEleusis under the headline A NEW RELIGION.A certain number of literary people know the name of Aleister Crowley as a poet.A few regard him as a magician. But a small and select circle revere him as thehierophant of a new religion.What perhaps really tips the scales in favor of it being a contact ofRadclyffe’s that sent Crowley off to New York, presumably with Radclyffe’srecommendation as middleman or carrier of financial instruments for contracts,is a letter I located recently at the Warburg. Incidentally, Crowley’s not beingidentifiable as banker, or commercial or government figure, was probablyadvantageous on account of the burgeoning heat in Washington and New Yorkregarding support for the Allies. The prospective deal probably touched a legalgray area at the time. Encouragingly, on October 15, State Department CounselorRobert Lansing, in line for secretary of state, denied any illegality in freeAmericans selling war supplies to belligerents, an announcement that swiftly ledto British Treasury envoys hot-shipping it to J. P. Morgan at 23 Wall Street.Two days after Lansing effectively challenged Bryan’s policy, Crowley wrote toO.T.O. Treasurer George Macnie Cowie about immediate disposition of O.T.O.property. The date of Crowley’s letter to Cowie is doubly significant and tiesup the sudden process of alert and departure.We shall become amply acquainted with Crowley’s experimental esoteric record ofsex magick called Rex de Arte Regia (“The King on the Royal Art”), commenced onSeptember 3, 1914. From it we learn that on October 14 at 8:17 p.m. O.T.O.Inspector General Leila Ida Nerissa Bathurst Waddell (“Mother of Heaven”)assisted chorus girl Violet Duval in a rite of sex magick with Crowley, whosewilled Object was health—an attempt to overcome the debilitating phlebitis. OnOctober 17, “Holy King” of the British “Sanctuary of the Gnosis,” Crowleyrecorded that the rite’s immediate results were “sudden, rather alarmingsymptoms the same night,” but afterward there ensued a “great improvement” sothat “today, 17 October, I am going about much as usual.” Crowley’s entry forNovember 1, the day after arriving in New York, connects the sex magick rite ofthe 14th directly with what followed. “The symptoms [of phlebitis] are still notaltogether vanished. But most assuredly some three days after the rite I had thefeeling of health—an indescribable but well-known sensation. I began manyenergetic things, made up my mind, and here I am in New York” (my italics).Those energetic things involved the writing of the following letter to Cowie onthe 17th, three days after the rite. The letter is telling and gives us a senseof a flurry over last-minute business plans awaiting a final go-ahead.The European situation, however, appears very bad, and I do not think that theorganized lying of the press will help it. I met a lady yesterday who had comeback from Antwerp. She says there is very little of it left, and quite concurswith the criticisms of the Morning Post, the only newspaper left to us with eventhe smallest regard for ordinary decency.I daresay you have by now got a copy of Radclyffe’s pamphlet “The War andFinance,” if not, do so; Smith’s book-stalls keep it. . . . There is no doubtthat we must have conscription. [my italics]The doctor called yesterday and said that I might now make experiments inwalking, but I must be pretty careful for the next two months. There is somehope too, of mother [“Mother of Heaven” Leila Waddell] getting on again, and ifshe can get a long tour of S. America, it will be splendid. [Leila touredprofessionally as a violinist.]. . . However, in case none of this comes off I think it best to dig ourselvesin for the winter, and the first step appears to me is to transfer the lease ofthe studio*67 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft67] to the trustees; I presume you haveno objection. . . . I have no plans at present, nor can have, until I know howthese various affairs may work out.By my calculations, the O.T.O. as it stands at present, is just about solvent.The Boleskine rent nearly covers the payment of interest, the rates of Boleskineand the rents and rates of the studio.. . . Of course, at any moment one might find a really strong, sound man to turnsolvency into wealth beyond dreams of avarice.18 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt150]One suspects in that last line that Crowley was dreaming of what might justtranspire in New York, and perhaps of one man in particular, as we shall see.Six days later, on the very eve of departure for New York from Liverpool,Crowley wrote again to “the Very Illustrious Sir Knight George Macnie CowieVII°.”I hope you will write to mother [Leila Waddell], and keep her happy. Luckily sheis booked for next week, and of course that may lead to better things [SouthAmerica?].19 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt151]"},{"pageContent":"ELEVENimage [images/9781620556313_099.jpg]My Egg Was AddledAs in the case of hypothetically connecting British construction magnate WeetmanPearson to Crowley’s sojourn in Mexico, I cannot imagine what spark ofinspiration made Richard B. Spence look for the name of George Macaulay Booth onthe passenger manifest records of New York’s Ellis Island.1[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt152] But he is there—on the same ship as Crowley, RMSLusitania, departing Liverpool on October 24, 1914.George Macaulay Booth, shipowner (recorded as “merchant” on the passengermanifest), aged thirty-seven, of Airlie Gardens, Kensington & Chelsea, wassurely a man with a firm grip on the “sinews of war.” Managing director of Booth& Co., with a fleet of Booth steamships, Booth was appointed director ofmunitions supply by the British prime minister in early 1915, handpicked fortalent and connections as a man who could get things done, a capabilityreflected in the title of Duncan Crow’s biography, “A Man of Push and Go”: TheLife of George Macaulay Booth—the kind of man, one would think, who could answerRaymond Radclyffe’s pamphlet prayer.Booth enjoyed established company offices at 17 Battery Place, the imposingRenaissance revival building designed by Henry Hardenbergh circa 1903 stillstanding between Wall Street and Battery Park, with advantageous views over justone watery artery of the Booth empire. Before radio dispatching, a man high in“White Hall,” as Number 17 was called, peered through a telescope for incomingships on the Hudson before alerting tugboats docked at the Battery with asix-foot megaphone.Operating in the West Indies and South America, the Booth Steamship Company wasacutely aware of German competition for the trade and wartime threats to itssurvival. That Booth & Co. would provide merchant-shipping services to the RoyalNavy probably explains why Ellis Island records show the arrival of one RichardBoyce, forty-five-year-old mechanic, who arrived on the Lusitania December 23,1914, giving as his destination “Booth & Co., 17 Battery Place.” His passage waspaid, the record shows, by the “British government.” Members of Booth & Co. wereelected to the U.S. Society of Naval Architects & Marine Engineers. Where loansand matériel were concerned, Booth was the man to have on the bridge of the shipof state.image [images/9781620556313_025.jpg]Fig. 11.1. The Whitehall Building (center, lower building), Battery Place, seenfrom Battery ParkWe are not surprised then to find Spence asserting that Crowley and Booth’sarrival in New York on the same ship at the same time was “certainly nocoincidence.”2 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt153] Well, it might have been.Nevertheless, on the circumstantial evidence, Spence suggests that Crowley wasto have been one of Booth’s minions or cut-outs in arranging contracts, but thedeal with Morgan, with Booth’s immediate and enthusiastic support, obviated theBeast’s services. Independent commercial agents were no longer wanted or needed;his “egg was addled.”3 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt154]We’ll get on to the highly controversial Morgan Bank issue presently, but it istrue that Crowley’s Confessions states: “It did not take me forty-eight hours todiscover that my egg was addled.”4 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt155] He doesn’tgive any details, only that he’d expected a fortnight to ensure a little splashwith his “special business” before a return to Blighty. What, he says, delayedhim ( for five years!) was that he had about £50 worth of U.S. currency (worthabout $5,000 today) and that “in the first week I sold over one hundred pounds’worth of first editions to a prominent collector. He [the collector whom Crowleynever names, calling him “Mr. D”] then expressed a wish to possess a completeset of my works and also two or three hundred manuscripts. This should havemeant at least five thousand dollars . . .” Crowley claims that he stayedinitially to oversee transport of the collectibles.The collector was none other than John Quinn, of course, and while Crowley didnot meet him until November 12, just under a fortnight after arriving, Spencetakes this palette of distinct facts as sufficient, when added to subsequentattestable connections, to advocate the theory that it was already anestablished intelligence objective for Crowley to ingratiate himself withincertain New York circles to further Britain’s war effort. That Crowley wouldspeak of his espionage as that of “a lone hand,” Spence suspects, was becauseCrowley was simply abiding by a prior condition communicated by an intelligencecontact that in view of who he was, and where he was (a neutral country), hewould always have to remain a deniable source, an unsalaried, dispensable asset,with the most tenuous link possible to security apparatus. If Spence’s theory iscorrect, we shall almost certainly never be able to prove it, and the theorythat Crowley was operating clandestinely from the very inception of his arrivalin New York must remain just that: a theory.Regarding the hypothetical link of Crowley to Booth and an unenviable status ofdeniable asset, I observe only four things at this stage, none in any wayconfirmatory or conclusive. First, an understanding of an intelligence valuewith no obligations from official authority would undoubtedly have suitedCrowley’s temperament; he was desperate to be used, preferably in intrigues,under practically any circumstances, and would have seen his having to make aliving off his wits as a reasonable challenge for a magician at war; he haduseful introductions to high-placed persons who might assist: courtesy, nodoubt, of Harrison, Radclyffe, Feilding, and possibly Commander Guy Marston atthe Admiralty. Crowley needed to feel free.Second, if such an understanding had occurred with an individual or individualsconnected to the Secret Intelligence Service or Admiral “Blinker” Hall’s NavalIntelligence Department, Crowley would have been informed that his conduct wouldbe closely watched, and he had better not attract to himself undesirable notice.Third, on December 17, Crowley says that he received and banked a further $500from Quinn for a collection of books. That would almost surely have concludedthat business; and yet, Crowley remained. By his own account, he did not find aspying opportunity until early spring 1915. Why then did he stay, especially ashe was feeling lonely and downhearted, and for his own personal sake, felt hehad endured enough of New York?Fourth, there is in fact no need to accept Spence’s macrotheory to explainCrowley’s espionage in New York, as Crowley’s own explanation—that it occurredfortuitously—is adequate to explain what occurred subsequently.An interesting detail that might color perception of Crowley arriving in NewYork in some relation to Macaulay Booth: Crowley’s diary entry for December 15,1914—the day before his Christmas dinner date with corporate lawyer Quinn andsome of Quinn’s friends—informs us that Crowley had “been generally invokingHermes or Mercury as the obvious God of this city of New York, and proposing tomake this new temple a Temple of Hermes by getting eight people to assist, andby making a circle on the floor, with the idea of building up a great Mercurialforce, a mighty Caduceus to rule this city.”5 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt156]Solitary invocations of Mercury continued on an almost daily basis until March10, 1915. I suggest that Crowley’s first material sighting of this “obvious God”of New York may still stare one in the face to this day. A stroll past 17Battery Place, once the majestic hub of Booth’s American mercantile operation,shows in no uncertain terms, on its ground floor, two huge sculpted stonecaduceuses, with wings and helmet, emblems of Hermes, god of commerce andtrickery, associated with fish and silver and messages from on high, flanked bycarvings of Pan, the All, repeated twice on the capitals! Crowley had alwaysrevered the horny god Pan. While visual references to Hermes as god of commerceand communication can be found in fabric details dotted about WallStreet—Mercury is also the principal statue atop Grand Central Station’s southface in the city center—it is hard to imagine those on Battery Place notregistering as salient sign to a symbol-sensitive magician who, less than a yearpreviously, had invoked Hermes with great energy by homosexual rites in Paris,and seen the god’s darting characteristics of spiritual enlightenment (heidentified Hermes with Christ), rebirth, transformation, and financial trickerycombined with boyish pranks visited on vain optimism. Crowley was invoking amighty force; there is a wisp of desperation in this, for as he knew well,Hermes, like his addled deal, could be a “slippery customer.”image [images/9781620556313_026.jpg]Fig. 11.2. Caduceus of Hermes, 17 Battery Place, ManhattanAstute readers may also note the parallel of his arrival in Mexico City fourteenyears earlier, when, as Chevalier O’Rourke, he busied himself establishing atemple to the “Lamp of Invisible Light,” with due invocations, as a magicalradix of cosmic energy to shed its power on his and his friends’ activities.And, as then, his determination to stay will be trumpeted by a newspaperarticle.And while we consider the role of journalists and secret machinations inCrowley’s New York arrival, Crowley perhaps left a clue as to what was going onin his Simon Iff detective story “What’s in a Name?”—the first in Crowley’sSimon Iff in America series. Opening with Iff’s arrival at New York’s CunardPier (where Crowley disembarked), Iff—after a swift passage through customs—isgreeted by “Keynes Aloysius Wimble,” described as “a native of Birmingham,England,” who discerned Iff’s “madness” was “as carefully calculated as a tableof logarithms.” Without doubt, Wimble is Maitland Ambrose Trevelyan Raynes(1879–1944), Crowley’s friend and, from 1914, foreign editor of the LiteraryDigest.*68 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft68]According to William Breeze, “Raynes may well have been a British intelligenceagent or asset working in Washington, D.C., and New York; he possessed many ofthe requisite abilities and was well placed professionally.”6[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt157] Breeze’s analysis inclines us to see thatCrowley may have revealed in two places, in telling and suggestive literarydisguise, something of what he did in his first forty-eight hours in New York.In the Iff story Crowley offers a coded account of being picked up by Raynes anddriven out to the countryside to meet a contact. Something about the contactCrowley may then have met is hinted at in a Warburg Institute (Yorke Collection)transcript. It may indicate a compulsion on Crowley’s part to imply the story bysecreting its substance in disparate writings. Written around February 1915 (hesays he’s been in New York three months and cites something published inFebruary), “Under the Ferule: A Study of New York” is a study of the city from aBritish perspective. In part “IX” Crowley describes a tall Englishman he dinedwith the night after landing. From the reference to being able to look south ofCentral Park, it appears the following exchange occurred uptown.The night after I landed a very distinguished Englishman, tall, languid,aristocratic, took me after dinner for a walk. “They will tell you,” he said,“that it is impossible or dangerous to tell the truth about this country in thiscountry. Do not believe it. You can write the truth, the whole truth, andnothing but the truth in fiery letters ten feet high if you go the right way towork.“Look!” he continued, “how’s that for Truth?” and he pointed to a tall buildingsouth of Central Park on whose roof was the blazing sky-sign:UNITED STATES TIRES “It won’t tire me,” said I. “I love children.”WHAT THE PAPERS SAIDIf on his way to his suite at the swish St. Regis Hotel at East 55th StreetCrowley had happened to notice New Yorkers reading the papers, chances are thatone of them would have had his or her nose in the Sun. A page 3 headline ofSaturday, October 31, 1914’s issue read: BRITON FINDS MANY GERMAN AGENTS INUNITED STATES. Taking a leaf, or article anyway, from out of London’s the DailyChronicle, the Sun relayed poet and journalist Harold Begbie’s experiences ofbeing in New York.Begbie had got on well with New Yorkers and was anxious to say that Germanguests Herr Doctor Dernburg and ambassador Count von Bernstorff were bothaffable, frank, dignified gentlemen, though the same could not be said of HermanRidder, editor of propaganda paper Staats Zeitung, who printed things that madean Englishman’s blood boil. Ridder was a friend of German propagandist GeorgeSylvester Viereck, whom Crowley would soon meet in New York, having met him oncein London at Austin Harrison’s English Review office. Both Viereck and Riddersat on Dr. Dernburg’s Propaganda Kabinett. Begbie recognized that propaganda wasa major issue in America for Great Britain and was anxious to point out thatwhile gentlemen appeared to front German efforts, below them lurked agents whopreyed very successfully upon the minds of pro-German workers in ordinary jobs.They were easily persuaded that Russia had started the war, and Germany wasfighting it to preserve the world from Russian domination. Where have we heardthat before?“There are,” Begbie, wrote, “German emissaries all over the country paid bysomeone to argue with American workers and to mingle with American crowds, paidto persuade every person they could get hold of that Germany will win the war.”First they used “vehement hatred” against the English, but, “finding thisunprofitable,” they had now become clever; it was all Russia’s fault. The reasonwas an abiding hope that American money would be forthcoming for Germany, butBegbie was convinced that this was a vain hope as Germany appeared to be losing,and, should they ever triumph, a Pan-Germanic empire would hardly accommodate anindependent United States of America. Begbie urged his English readers to getserious about America and recognize its importance to the long-term war effort.In this context, of course, Crowley’s eventual activities make even more vividsense.*69 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft69]The Evening World (page 4) reported that Crowley’s ship, the Lusitania was LateBecause of Fog and High Seas—not German cruisers—and that among its rathernervous 911 passengers safely docked were Mrs. William Vanderbilt(photographed), Mr. and Mrs. Vincent Astor, and two named correspondents fromthe fighting in Belgium. Crowley and George Macaulay Booth did not of coursecome with the obvious glamour associated with the Astors and Vanderbilts. Nor,for that matter, did the “500 Irishmen” whom the Sun (page 4) noted had arrivedin New York: 500 Irishmen Dodge War. Cunard liner Franconia had, the paperreported, brought from Queenstown, Ireland, several hundred Irishmen and boys,many of whom desired to escape military service should conscription come intoforce. This might have given Crowley a clue at some point, depending on when itwas that he chose, or had already chosen, to use his “Irish” image as a coverfor apparently pro-German activity. He would also have seen clearly that beingseen as a pro-German Irishman was not going to win him any glamour or popularityat all.Another headline on page 5 of the Sun gives a flavor of the moment: Expect MoreForeign Loans: “The arrangement of the French loan of $10m, it is believed inWall Street, will be followed by similar loans to European countries to pay forsupplies purchased here.” To the right, England Still Buying Gold. A “specialcable dispatch” from London revealed the Bank of England had added $860,000worth of gold eagles and bar gold to its supply. This was possibly the kind ofdeal Crowley was assisting with.The gold theme continued in the Monday, November 2, edition of the New YorkTribune, whose front page announced $25,000,000 GOLD COMING “Secrecy Helps toGuard Largest Shipment Ever Made.” Not so secret, the Tribune hadn’t caught onthat the gold “left Denver last Friday . . . to be locked safely in the vaultsof the Sub-Treasury in the City by ten o’clock this morning.” The AmericanExpress Company handled the shipment in three special cars over several railroadlines.Money was itching to move: ROCKEFELLER MILLIONS WILL FEED BELGIANS. “Relief Shipto Sail Tomorrow Bearing 4,000 tons of Supplies.” The supplies had beenpurchased by the Rockefeller Foundation for relieving Belgian miseries. TheBritish Council agreed to certify that the supplies were solely fornoncombatants. The “neutrality” issue was in constant flux. The British had justannounced that neutral shipping that had traded with German ports could beimpounded. Another headline that day showed an intensification of the conflictinto global dimensions: TURKEY DECLARES WAR ON RUSSIA, ANNEXES EGYPT, DEFIESENGLAND (New York Tribune, November 1). Even though Turkey had Germany for anally, claims to annex Egypt were wishful thinking; the British Fleet commandedthe Mediterranean.As regards magazines of note, Crowley almost certainly read the books section ofthe November issue of Albert Shaw’s American Review of Reviews, which JeanneRobert Foster, recently back from England, will have had an uncredited role incompiling. The November section on new books relating to the war included arespectful, even generous, review of Professor Hugo Münsterberg’s latestpropaganda tome. Münsterberg, who Crowley would soon take the trouble to get toknow and, he would claim, influence, was Harvard’s professor of psychology. Healso sat in on the first committee of Dr. Dernburg’s Propaganda Kabinett, andhis pro-German booklets were strongly featured and advertised in pro-Germanmagazine, the Fatherland, edited by sophisticated poet and essayist GeorgeSylvester Viereck.7 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt158]According to the review the professor “has gathered his various letterscontributed to the newspapers during the past three months, together withconsiderable other historical material, into a lucid and authoritative book. TheWar and America (Appletons, $1). From the German point of view he reveals thetrue inside of the war, its motives and issues, and their vital meaning forAmerica.”8 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt159] It is hard work today to readMünsterberg’s extraordinary claims on behalf of Germany’s superior civilization.His “four premises” are by today’s standards outrageous, racist, extremestateism. The German state had the right by virtue of its preeminence tochallenge the whole world if necessary for the “higher cause” it embodied. Atthe time Münsterberg’s premises would have been considered typical products of aGerman arrogance insisting only German science and civilization could save theworld from barbarism. Somehow all this justified invading France, Poland, andneutral Belgium, and the shelling and shooting of civilians in the German army’spath. Crowley would write in his Confessions that he noted a distinct pro-Germanpoint of view in Albert Shaw’s Review of Reviews; this is not fully justified,but had Crowley’s first acquaintance with the magazine been this particularsoft-pedaling review, one can understand it, because while the book is“reviewed,” its contents are subject only to cursory, polite criticism.Propaganda was consistently getting in under the line of “balance,”evenhandedness and fairness, as it does today. Crowley concluded quickly thatGerman propaganda was more effective and sophisticated than what he had leftbehind in London where “patriot Bottomley” could fill a headline in John Bullwith lines like “To Hell with Serbia!”Proving that financial relations between the United States and Great Britainwere not all one-way, we find the Tribune reporting, a fortnight into Crowley’ssojourn (November 14), that an Anglo-American frame-work had been drawn up for acredit plan “to pay Debts to Britain.” A proposal outlined drawing against $100million in the Bank of England to cover U.S. commercial interests’ “indebtednessto Great Britain”: “If this plan is accepted, American officials are certainthat foreign exchange will be again on practically a normal basis and that tradebetween the U.S. and Great Britain will again flow freely through its accustomedchannels and with increasing volume.” It should be noted that George MacaulayBooth was elected a director of the Bank of England in April 1915. There was agood deal of stitching going on that would not “go public” in the United Statesuntil the time of Booth’s election.Spence is convinced that the most significant factor in the addling of Crowley’segg came from negotiations with the J. P. Morgan Bank, begun by British Treasuryrepresentatives Basil Blackett and George Paish in mid-October with finalarrangements concluded in London in 1915, whither traveled Morgan partner HenryPomeroy Davison (1867–1922) in late November 1914.9[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt160] It is a reasonable proposition, but negotiationswith Morgan were not concluded within “forty-eight hours” of Crowley’s or of G.M. Booth’s arrival. Negotiations were difficult, partly because the moneymarkets were so unsettled, the figures enormous, and the City of New York had tojustify its creditworthiness in gold, movements of which on the high seas weresubject to panic and war restrictions. Furthermore, British Prime MinisterAsquith did not want the British public to think that the empire neededfinancial assistance.It may have been a gold transaction that Crowley was initially involved with.Henry Davison as a Morgan senior partner was closely involved in establishingthe city’s gold reserves.10 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt161] As Thomas W. Lamontwrites in his account of Davison’s brilliant handling of the foreign exchangesituation in London in the winter of 1914–1915, the Morgan bank was the crucialplayer in enabling the British and French governments to purchase credit, stock,and matériel in New York.Early in the War the members of the Morgan firm realized the benefits whichaccrue to America’s export trade, if the Allies were able to find adequatecredit facilities here. This a leading consideration which prompted J. P. Morgan& Co. to undertake the burden of leadership in practically all of the publicloan operations in America, of the British and French Governments during thefirst three years of the War. It was manifestly to the distinct advantage of theAmerican community to extend credit on such a scale to the Allied Governments aswould enable the latter to continue their enormous purchases of American grain,cotton, copper, steel, leather, and other products.11[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt162]image [images/9781620556313_027.jpg]Fig. 11.3. Belle da Costa Greene (1883–1950)Expunged for some reason from Symonds and Grant’s edited version of Crowley’sConfessions was Crowley’s statement that one of the first people he met in NewYork was Belle Greene. Judging by a diary entry in Crowley’s Magical Record forMay 31, 1920, he had enjoyed a limited romance with Belle da Costa Greene(1883–1950), proud manager of the Pierpoint Morgan Library, 29 East 36th Street.His excitement to love could have flowered into complete romance, confidedCrowley to himself, but for one flaw that put him off: Belle’s “manner.”Daughter of Richard Greener, first black American to enter Harvard but who, dueto racial prejudice, remade herself and her name into an exotic Portuguese,Belle only dated men of standing, such as the late John Pierpont Morgan(1837–1913) and art scholar Bernard Berenson (1865–1959). But there must havebeen something between Crowley and her to begin with. Her late beau’s son,financier Jack Morgan, was now deeply involved in securing Allied financialservices, while her job was to run Jack’s late father’s library and artcollection, buying, researching, and assessing value of books and artworks. Whatbrought Crowley to Belle is not known. It might have been the books he wouldagree to selling to Quinn on November 12; that is, because Quinn did not buy allCrowley was offering, Quinn might have suggested Crowley sell rare works to thePierpont Morgan Library. Quinn and Belle knew each other well. Spence suggestedthat Belle da Costa Greene was probably part of Morgan’s private intelligenceservice, run by Martin Egan, Morgan’s “publicity chief” who was a good sourcefor forty-four-year-old British naval attaché Guy Gaunt, running NavalIntelligence Department (N.I.D.) schemes from the British Consulate at 44Whitehall Street. High up in this Morgan-N.I.D. nexus was, according tointelligence scholar Thomas Troy, a “Mr. Green,” identified with surprisingconfidence by Spence as Belle Greene’s code name.12[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt163]While Spence’s numerous hypotheses linking Crowley to allegedintelligence-related figures carry weight in speculative terms, little is knownfor certain, though the critical mass of related circumstantial data cannot beignored in fairness to the historical record. One thing is certain: when aperson arrives pretty fresh in a big city, he or she will know soon enoughwhether they are “in” or “out.” Judging by Crowley’s string of contactsencountered in New York in November and December 1914, he was definitely “in,”and, despite frustrations tantalizingly expressed in his unique sex-magickdiary, he had just sufficient money and status to make an impact, even if Quinnwas, as he asserted defensively to William Butler Yeats, immune to Crowley’sglamour.We know for sure that Crowley met the following lights of New York media andculture within two months of stepping off the Lusitania: out-spoken Irishnovelist and pro-German Frank Harris (whom Crowley had known in London), JohnQuinn, Belle da Costa Greene, magazine and newspaper editors Frank Crowninshieldand John O’Hara Cosgrave, John Butler Yeats, multimillionaire Aimée Gouraud (néeCrocker), astrologer Evangeline Adams, and New York World journalist Henry NobleHall. That’s not bad going for a man who claimed that he only expected to cookan egg and scarper home in a fortnight.It may be the case that it only required Crowley to make one key contact toensure the string of contacts that appeared in fairly rapid succession. Take thefollowing link, for example. We earlier mentioned Crowley’s “Affidavit” of 1917wherein, failing to get a decent response from Guy Gaunt of the New York N.I.D.operation, he was advised by high society beaux arts sculptor Paul WaylandBartlett (1865–1925), then working in Washington, to contact London Timescorrespondent and S.I.S. man Arthur Willert, also based in Washington.Later knighted for services to His Majesty, Sir Arthur Willert wrote The Road toSafety: A Study in Anglo-American Relations, in which Willert described Quinn asone of the “staunchest supporters that the Allies, especially the French, hadamong the Irish-American leaders.”13 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt164] Quinnhimself in due course effectively confirmed this. “I have given my time and mystrength and my money to the pro-Ally causes of all nationalities.”14[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt165] It must be said that if it was the gaunt, balddome of slim John Quinn who set Crowley’s social ball rolling, then it isextremely unlikely that Quinn did it purely out of gratitude for Crowley’sselling him copies of his rare books and manuscripts! Of course, as Quinn hadbeen sympathetic, though in a highly qualified manner, to Sir Roger Casement, hemight have taken an interest in Crowley had Crowley played his “Irish” cardstrongly. William Breeze has observed that had Crowley opted for posing as Irishin Quinn’s company, the ever-sharp Quinn would not have been fooled for asecond. Decent-minded as Quinn undoubtedly was, he was not obliged to provideCrowley with working funds in exchange for Crowleyana and could easily havesuggested that Crowley’s place was in England, unless, that is, Quinn was givento understand that for some reason Crowley was useful in New York. Just how“useful” Crowley could be, and to whom, we may now begin to explore."},{"pageContent":"TWELVELower into the WaterThe first days of November 1914 were pleasant in New York. The temperaturereached the high fifties around midday, permeated occasionally by a chillybreeze from the sea, and all was generally fair, peppered with a few clouds inhigh-pressure, dry conditions that had spread up from the south. Crowley’s firsttaste of New York in eight and a half years might have been a surprise insofaras so much had changed, but a temporary suite in the elegant St. Regis wasdoubtless reassuring. The hotel’s seventeen stone stories rose majestically intothe peaceful skies dominating everything below them, and, were he not anxiousand still suffering some irritation in his leg, he might, briefly, have felt ontop of the world.The streets below the huge stars and stripes that fluttered above the hotel’scrown were crammed with considerably more motorized vehicles than he would haveseen in 1906; this was the new, hard steel land that Henry Ford had made, andthe horses and carriages and hansoms and carts had vanished from most ofManhattan, bar Central Park, leaving single-celled cabs, smelly trucks, andmotor buses to course up, down, and across the city’s clogged arteries. The cityhad not one heart but millions, beating, pulsing, in and out of strange timesfull of strangers.One wonders what hat Crowley would have worn. Would he have taken a bowler toblend in with the regiments of merchants and insurance men, or sported a silktop hat like a senior banker? Perhaps he wore a homburg; they were very commonin Manhattan in 1914, as were felt derbies and soft flat hats like boaters amonga few modest-brimmed stet-sons. Service staff wore spotless, bright-trimmeduniforms; cabbies wore peaked caps like seamen; women wore all kinds of exoticand plain broad-brimmed creations above the general fashion for stiff,single-breasted jackets tapered at the hips above long, dark skirts ofsubstantial fabric. Ladies wore as much fur as they could afford, from furlapels to mink stoles. Did Crowley, in an effort to blend in, conform to clubcollar, tie, and studs? One wants to doubt it; he loved big, bohemian bow tiesand spacious jackets; he was a poet, after all, though he could look the dudewhen he wanted to.And it was doubtless as a poet that Crowley called on novelist and journalistFrank Harris (1855–1931), reckless Irish rake who had endured and enjoyed a lifeboth tough and self-indulgent, having been a penniless migrant to America in hisyouth, who worked in hotels in Chicago and the cattle industry in Kansas beforestudying and returning to London, where he enjoyed success as a newspaper editorand at some point met the equally reckless and self-indulgent Crowley. Harrishad been a guest at Winston Churchill’s wedding, though politically the twoEdwardian characters were at some remove. Harris had taken to socialism, andthis colored his journalism. There was a hunger for change, fundamental change;it was perhaps the one thing that united artists and workers.Crowley did not have far to go to find Frank Harris, for Harris was staying atthe St. Regis himself; he’d been back in America since the outbreak of war andhad brought the chip on his shoulder with him. It is likely that Harrisintroduced Crowley to figures of his acquaintance, among whom stood out thefascinating, urbane English lecturer and budding novelist Louis UmfrevilleWilkinson (pen name “Louis Marlow,” 1881–1966).*70[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft70]Wilkinson appealed to Crowley; here was a man who had been sent down from Oxfordfor blasphemy in 1901 and who had corresponded with Oscar Wilde when Wilde wasjailed in Reading for homosexuality—not that Crowley was a Wilde worshipper, byany means. Wilkinson, who would pen a portrait of Harris—and of Crowley—in hisbook Seven Friends (1953), dwelled in New York’s borough of Queens, at RockawayBeach, on Long Island’s south side, a short train ride away.Harris has also been credited with introducing Crowley to William B. Seabrook,Hearst journalist with a powerful penchant for voodoo and S&M. Emily BerthaCrowley would doubtless have preferred more respectable friends for her son,but, like Jesus, Crowley could not eschew the company of despised people andwhores. As he would later observe, “You can be respected, or you can berespectable, but you cannot be both.” He placed this distinction in the contextof medieval virtus, virile strength of character, or chivalry: the propermeaning of virtue. No artist could afford to be respectable; it was a barrier tothe wells of truth. Not that Harris, in particular, cared to sup from thosewells as a way of life. As Max Beerbohm observed, Harris only told the truthwhen his invention flagged.However, there is one person that I suspect Harris may have provided a directpath to. This was a man who respected truth very much, for he knew precisely howto twist it. George Sylvester Viereck (1884–1962) was editor of pro-Germanpropaganda weekly the Fatherland, run from an office at 1123 Broadway, financedfrom official German funds through Heinrich Albert. Crowley’s Confessions relatethat when he came face-to-face with him, Viereck reminded fellow poet Crowleythat they had met formerly at Austin Harrison’s offices in London; Crowley wasblasé about Viereck’s recollection. He obviously preferred not to get on thesubject of the English Review, for which he had contributed patriotic verse andrecommendations as to how to win the war!image [images/9781620556313_028.jpg]Fig. 12.1. George Sylvester Viereck (1884–1962)Crowley’s account of how he got mixed up in German propaganda is as amusing ashe could make it and, as told in his Confessions, began “One day, I think, earlyin 1915” with an accidental conversation on a bus begun by a stranger called“O’Brien” with the words “Do you believe in a fair deal for Germany andAustria-Hungary?” to which the sporting Englishman replied that he believed in afair deal for everybody. Unfortunately, there is a problem with this account.Crowley’s first article for the Fatherland appeared in print on January 13,1915, and, as we shall see, was remarkable because the editor introduced itswriter—new to the magazine—as “the pro-British poet.” Anyone familiar with theaccepted tale who has not consulted the issue should be surprised at this, for,allowing for a natural run-up period from introduction to publication, Crowley’scontact, or desire to contact, the German propaganda apparatus must havepre-dated early 1915. As for the line about “a Fair Deal for Germany andAustria-Hungary,” this was, in fact, the official strapline to the Fatherland’smasthead.image [images/9781620556313_029.jpg]Fig. 12.2. The Fatherland’s mastheadThree weeks after Crowley’s Fatherland article was published, “Snobbery inExcelsis” appeared on page 8 of the magazine (February 3, 1915). The articlestated that England’s claim to be fighting for “freedom” was a lie, becausefreedom was what she denied to her own and to Ireland. Nor could her claim to befighting “militarism” hold water, for Great Britain was “the proud despot of theworld.” The “truth” was rather that Britain envied Germany, and wished to reduceher greatest commercial rival and to plunder her goods by naval blockade andother violent means. H. G. Wells was quoted: Germany’s advances, instead ofchastening England, simply irritated her.The writer of this distinctly pro-German piece was Frank Harris. A report fromBritish ambassador Cecil Spring-Rice flew to London complaining that Harrisexpressed “a profound detestation for England and a contempt for France.”1[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt166] The British ambassador’s view is borne outeloquently in a letter of January 25, 1915, from John Quinn to W. B. Yeats.There is another more or less cracked “man of letters” out here now also, whomyou perhaps know, Mr. Frank Harris.*71 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft71]Intellectually, he is as crooked as the biblical ram’s horn, if there was aram’s horn in the bible, and from what I heard financially he is as crooked astwo rams’ horns.I happened to wander into a lecture by him one night, taken there by my friend,Mitchell Kennerley, who loaned him a floor in his building, without rent, andfound Harris delivering a violently anti-English and ecstatically pro-Germanspeech. At the end of his speech I punctured him flat by asking whether,assuming all that he had said about England to be true, that she was autocratic,undemocratic, snobbish, caddish, unhygienic, unscientific, backward in herbusiness methods, made little or no provision for mothers or babes, and furtherassuming all he said about Germany were true, that she produced the greatestsynthetic chemists, the greatest scientists, physicians, philosophers,musicians, and statesmen, and that she was the great and ideal state of thefuture—assuming “Mr. Harris,” I said, “all these things to be true, do they giveGermany any right to invade her neighbours’ territories and murder herneighbours, plunder their cities and steal their territory?” Harris replied that“the gentleman’s question implies a quarrel with God.” I said, “Ah, yes, you apethe Kaiser ‘Me unt Gott!’” Harris said: “No, I mean your quarrel with the law ofevolution.” I replied that all of the things that he boasted that Germanyexcelled in, art, science, government, music, philosophy, chemistry, research,institutions, everything that went to make the civilized state, all those thingsexisted to mitigate and frustrate nature’s law of the survival of the fit-test;that Germany claimed to be a nation of culture but still he was harking back tothe law of the brute, to the stone age, as a justification for Germany fortaking and doing what she wanted. Harris is a clever writer, an exasperatingliar, has considerable power of sarcasm, but he is not reasoned. I did notintend to interrupt him, but when I got through there was nothing left to do. Hewas punctured as flat as a collapsed balloon.Kennerley says that he is a Jew and that his name is Cohen. He was introducedthat night as having Welsh blood, but born in Galway. I have heard of hisclaiming to be Welsh, to be Irish, and to be American. . . . But a hundredHarrises could not change public opinion in this country, 90% of which is withthe allies.2 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt167]The British embassy clearly had its eye on Harris, and on the Fatherland. Andso, we might surmise did Crowley, for Crowley lets another fact slip unnoticedinto his fragmentary narratives of early life in New York.In chapter 77 of the Confessions, Crowley says that what kept him in New Yorkbeyond the initial fortnight allotted for “special business” was the “prominentcollector’s” purchase of more than £100’s worth of first editions, followed bythe collector’s expressed wish for a complete collection plus “two or threehundred manuscripts.” It is worth recalling that the collector was the same JohnQuinn who undertook to purchase installments of manu-scripts from W. B. Yeatsfor the ulterior motive of funding John Butler Yeats’s life at the Petitpasboarding rooms. Was Quinn looking for ways to justify funding Crowley—ensuringhe at least got something in return?Not following Quinn’s train of thought perhaps, Crowley expected a complete dealfor the lot, all in one, which would have yielded, he calculated “at least fivethousand dollars” (the rate of exchange was about $4.70 = £1).3[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt168] “So,” writes Crowley, “I cabled for the stuffand hung around, with the result that my political opportunity came along. Whenthe books arrived from England, the collector changed his mind and only bought asmall proportion of the consignment. This left me flat, and besides, I wasgetting into my stride in countermining Münsterberg. So I stagnated in New York,getting lower in the water every day” 4 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt169] [myitalics].Crowley states that while waiting for the books his “political opportunity camealong.” Well, the books had arrived by December 16, for on that date Crowley’sdiary clearly indicates that Quinn “promised me $500 on a collection of books.”That was the “small proportion of the consignment”—very disappointing forCrowley, no doubt. Nonetheless, the figure was gratefully received and bankedthe next day. The nature of Crowley’s disappointment is revealed when we examinepreviously unpublished records of these transactions as they appeared to Quinnin the next chapter.So, by Crowley’s own account, he was already “getting into his stride incountermining Münsterberg” by December 16. This dating makes sense of hismaterial reaching the Fatherland by early January 1915. It may have been Harriswho passed the “teaser” article to Viereck or one of Viereck’s assistanteditors, Rethy or Harvey.When Crowley approaches the period from another angle in chapter 81 of hisConfessions we get the sense his first few months were a protracted misery. Wealso see what he meant by the phrase “political opportunity” above.I had arrived with a not inconsiderable reputation, both as a man of letters andas a Magician. I had numerous connections with prominent people in both campsand was furnished with excellent introductions. I was positively stupefied todiscover, by the most baffling experiences, that by none of these means could Imake my way into public life. I lectured with apparent success; yet literallynothing came of it. I was welcomed by editors and publishers, written up andentertained with surprising enthusiasm; yet I failed to sell a single poem,story, essay, or even article (except in the special case of political writingin one paper of no credit) and no one would hear of publishing a book.Occasionally, a man [Quinn? Someone else?] promised great things; but thearrangements always fell through suddenly and unreasonably. I had a host offriends in the city, yet days and weeks would pass without my seeing a soulexcept in the most casual way.5 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt170] [my italics]An article about the nature of propaganda was Crowley’s “political writing” forthe “paper of no credit”; the first part of “Honesty is the Best Policy” waspublished in the Fatherland on January 13. It is now clear Crowley was alreadyon the German propaganda trail by mid-December 1914, and this opens thepossibility that Spence’s theory that Crowley’s coming to New York involvedespionage from the start could arguably be, at least in part, correct. On theother hand, it is still possible that Crowley was simply kicking his heels inNovember and early December waiting for the book consignment and, bored andfrustrated, looked into Harris’s connection with Viereck, and having long sincecrossed swords with Münsterberg (in association with Naval Intelligence officer,Lt. Everard Feilding), and being aware of the “respectable” professor’s part inGerman propaganda—patently obvious to anyone reading the Review of Reviews, theFatherland, and other outlets—had a moment of inspiration of how he could yetserve his country (if he wasn’t already). As before, both readings lead us tothe same place, but it is surely significant that Crowley puts mist around thecircumstances of his association with Viereck and company, attributing thecontact to pure chance followed by a fateful moment of personal daring. He mayalso, of course, have been protecting Harris, if Harris was, as seems likely,the first link to Viereck. It should also be borne in mind that Crowley’s firstFatherland contribution—and there would be a very long gap until the nextone—was definitely presented as the work of a “pro-British poet,” and he hadtherefore a long way to go to prove to the pro-Germans that he shared theirpolitical prejudices. And this point, as we shall see, then makes considerablesense of Crowley’s dramatic performance as a pro-German “Irish Republican” onJuly 3, 1915, done at great personal risk, to show German propagandists that hewas not really pro-British and had definitively cut the painter. If you findthis complicated, that’s because it is. Crowley perennially took anidiosyncratically oblique approach to real-world situations. In the spiritualrealm he was direct. Crowley had a curious, and revealing, analytical logic andhumor of his own, as evinced in this little phrase from a wartime notebook.When Darwin buggered the monkey, God came unstuck.6[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt171]"},{"pageContent":"THIRTEENThe Magick of a New York Christmas: World War I StyleThe Universe is not an object; it is an arrangement of forces or laws(classically: “gods”), which when expressed through space and time may appearlimitless. But none of these concepts are objects either. That is to say, we donot know if the cosmos is finite or infinite, only that, as I suspect, if youwere to travel to an anticipated “limit,” extension of the observer beyond thatlimit would manifest in more universe, because the perceiver is creative of theuniverse of our knowing, material perception being conformable to law, andbecause “limit” is a condition of space, and were there no space, there could beno limit. Velocity requires the possibility of infinite extension, but extensionis a category of mind, not an object. The laws of the universe are absolutelyrigid, their possible manifestation infinitely fluid.On November 7, 1914, Crowley engaged in his first act of sex magick in theUnited States at the St. Regis Hotel, New York City.Some observations: First, while Crowley’s specialist diary Rex de Arte Regiagives details of sex-magick experiments, rites, and “operations,” the detailsare mostly for scientific purposes so that objective observations anddemonstrations could be compared and reflected upon rationally. Crowley waslearning about the “secret of the O.T.O.” (IX°), imparted to him in principle in1912 by the O.T.O.’s “Outer Head” Theodor Reuss, suspected by Crowley, in August1914, of having left London with the Prussian secret service. In fact, we knowonly a certain amount about what else Crowley was doing in the period but forhis account in his Confessions, which, while brilliantly expressed, isselective, self-serving, and above all, literary in character, written after thewar under appalling constraints. Nevertheless, investigation confirms much ofwhat Crowley related in his autobiography as matters of fact. But he was alsocovering aspects of his life in that work, mainly for legal or obligatorypurposes. Taken by themselves, as they too often have been, the sex magickdiaries give a highly distorted picture both of Crowley’s life in general, andof the character of the sexual rites themselves.In Rex de Arte Regia, Crowley records the date and number of the “opus,” orwork, in temporal sequences; the name and immediate background of the“assistant” (if there was one); the conditions (place, weather, state of mind ofparticipants); the primary sexual method; sometimes the astrological setting atthe time of the opus (and sometimes, if he knew it, the astrological conditionsat the assistant’s own birth); the willed “Object” of the work (its purpose);the state of the “Elixir,” or sacrament (usually combined semen and vaginalfluids = “bread” and “wine”); and any results, recorded over a period, thoughCrowley would quickly conclude that results ought to manifest within a fortnightlest “chance” play too obvious a role.The raw character of data occasionally gives an impression of cold, calculatedencounters with indifferent partners. The repetitive, formal nature of thesequences emphasizes this characteristic. This sex magick may appear very“unsexy.” That is because the documents are intended for Crowley’s analysis, notexpressions of his incurable romanticism. These were pioneering experiments inmagical practice and scientific para-psycho-physiology.Could sexual rites cause changes in nature in conformity with will (and naturallaw)? This was the question addressed, and though a highly problematic one, itwas not a question Crowley would shirk. It also helped if he enjoyed himself;that is, threw himself into the enthusiasm of the moment, rather than thinkingabout it. Besides, magick, he had always insisted in the past, should only bepracticed when ordinary methods were proving impossible, weak, or ineffective.All willed objectives may par-take of the character of magic, but strictlymagical rites call on obscure dimensions of the human being that rationalityalone cannot currently access: this being the chief methodological problem formaterialist science.Crowley was attractive to many women, and men, and he was by training and naturecourteous, considerate, somewhat shy, and romantic, if the partner wasresponsive. He could be caustic and very sarcastic otherwise, but one only hasto read his letters to women to realize the baselessness of the myth ofCrowley’s being some kind of brute and the women “dupes,” though he was often bynormal standards, irresponsible. “If a fool would persist in his folly, he wouldbecome wise” (Blake).It is also vital to grasp that Crowley’s conception of sex and the organs ofsexual life were anything but the clinical objects familiar to doctors andgynecologists, not that Crowley eschewed the scientific dimension. Semen for himwas “the most powerful, the most radiant thing that existeth in the wholeuniverse,”1 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt172] the “lord, the giver of life” if youlike. Following traditional alchemical symbols, he called it the “lion,” kingly,golden; the female secretions constituted the “eagle,” noble skyward bird thatseizes upon the lion. Participants in magical rites were kings and queens,generating a magical birth. The penis was the sun’s vice-regent on Earth and thewomb the Holy Grail. He refers to the vagina as the “cucurbit,” simply takingover the alchemical term for the vessel in which liquid is boiled so that vapormay rise and be distilled into magical elixir. He believed sexual magick was asecret of alchemy, expressed in chemical, abstract, as well as mystico-religiousand esoteric terms due to centuries of authoritarian religion’s sex-negativedoctrines. It made sense to Crowley’s understanding of human evolution andreligious history that the sexual essence of alchemy had been, to his mind,deliberately obscured.Crowley despised what he called “filth”; that is, careless sex acts of merelyphysical stimulation offering only “a relief redolent of defecation,” as he putit. Sex was a natural constituent of our being and was best transformed into itshigher, spiritual potential. First, obviously, was the creation of a fabulousnew human wonder being, but in addition, Man had the ability and right toexpress his “true will” (godly nature) through his or her fundamental nature asa sexual, creative, magical being. The more art, finesse, and passionate lifeone could bring to the love rite, the better. Enthusiasm was, he discovered, aprimary necessity. Magick was to be joyous: the spirit set free.Crowley’s basic attitude to sex is revealed in simple terms in a nice letter hewrote to friend Blanche Conn in 1923. Blanche had just dispatched 3,333 francsto Tunis to assist Crowley’s desperate straits after his having been expelledfrom Italy by Mussolini.The whole point is that the sex instinct is the creative instinct and you can’tget out of the responsibility of utilizing that instinct because of the dictatesof your fathers and the sins of your sister women. As long as the sex problembothers you, so long will you continue to be only a little bit of your trueself—and less and less as you go on in years.. . . I wish I had time to write a treatise on the difference between repressionand control.2 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt173]I wish he had too.*72 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft72]How did sex magick work? Crowley aimed to discover by experiment both if and, ifpossible, how it worked, or worked best. While it could not achieve things thatwere by nature contrary to law—to do so would be to cast the entire cosmos intoanarchy, which is not its nature—the idea of the galvanized will operating onfluid factors, shaping existing tendencies and innate possibilities at a deeper(subatomic?) level than obvious cause and effect, this the theory of sexualmagick could accommodate.Crowley observed energies and patterns in the workings of nature thatfacilitated, say, the flow of money transactions, or the sense of attractivenessand magnetism, or even ebullience of health. Such possibilities could beencouraged or invoked through god-forms, the theory asserted, by acts of purewill, so long as that will was “true” or of its essential character. Willpowerhad real power in this field: a staple of magical theory; Christ did the “will”(Greek: hē thelēma) of “he” who sent him, commanding demons as enemies accusedhim of drawing power from them.By Christmas 1914, Crowley realized that he faced a technical problem: how “tofix the volatile” (an alchemical procedure). He could concentrate wholly on theoperation’s Object, or purpose, or the words of the Object, but exactly how tohold together the evoked forces and project or “birth” them onto what ÉliphasLévi called the “Astral light” or “Universal agent,” or fluid plane of magiccausation, this was an abiding problem; it seemed to require an elusive knack.There were also, of course, all the usual problems and pitfalls, risks andriders appropriate to any form of magic or willed action. “Love is the law, loveunder will.”Crowley’s American sex-magick career began on November 7, 1914, with Opus IV, arite of masturbation with his left hand while imagining the image of “Babalon.”Derived from the Gnostic Aeon, or “goddess” Barbelo, who reflects the unknowableFather image while conveying spermatic fruitfulness (pneuma = “spirit”), Babalonis the god-form corresponding to Crowley’s “Scarlet Woman” (cf the HinduShakti-imbued “Red Goddess” Lalita Tripurasundari), divine partner of the“Beast” (solar Man) on Earth. On this occasion the Beast’s willed Object was“success.”A week later Crowley recorded immediate, but disappointing, results. “Things inNew York have moved slowly and badly so far.” The week gap was due to “lack ofleisure and opportunity.” He had had his first meeting with John Quinn, however.“Many Magi might rejoice seeing that I sold £500 or so of books on November 12.[$700 does not equal £500; there’s a calculation error; Crowley was expectingmore than had been agreed.] And that today, 14 November, all my difficulties onother lines seem to have cleared away. But this Magus [magician, not grade]wants definite, complete success all round. Call no man happy until he isdead—or at least has left New York!” Crowley seems to refer here to hisfinancial “business.” This rather supports Crowley’s own story that he picked upon the propaganda idea independently, while waiting for his manuscript and/orbook consignment to arrive.Crowley had suffered from a cold following Opus IV and experienced a “feeling”or “intuition” that his method was not “altogether right.” He made a divinationon the question by opening Book VII of his inspired Holy Books of Thelema, andletting his seal ring fall at random, on chapter 4, verse 49. “I have caughtThee, O my soft thrush; I am like a hawk of mother-of-emerald; I catch Thee byinstinct, though my eyes fail from thy glory.” From this he concluded that themethod was probably all right.On December 22 he would again reflect on results regarding “success”: “I thinkon the whole I may say I have had success though its results are not manifestaltogether. But I have had love, money, pupils, clients, fame, and my prospectslook very bright all round. Yes, I shall call this success.”Round one to sex magick.Among positive outcomes, Crowley did not specifically mention meeting Quinn’sfriend Belle da Costa Greene at the J. P. Morgan Library, but it was probablyfairly near this time that Crowley confided to her an audacious, dastardly ideato motivate Americans into war with Germany. Confessions editors Symonds andGrant removed the original passage, possibly because it might have been used toimply the Germans’ sinking of civilian ship Lusitania in May 1915 withtremendous loss of life was linked to a British intelligence plot. Indeed,perhaps the most significant hypothetical argument for British intelligencedenying Crowley’s intelligence role at all may have been linked to that verypossibility: that it was Admiral Hall’s policy at N.I.D. to let or encourageGermany into acts visible to Americans as hostile to themselves and theirprinciples. Certainly, after it happened, Crowley encouraged Fatherland staff toassert brazenly that it was Germany’s right and duty to sink the ship, knowingthis would affect Americans’ perception of the “justice” of Germany’s vaunted“cause,” inculcating the idea that defense against violence required thatGermany be stopped.A frustrated Crowley’s imaginative suggestion to Belle was that he pose as awealthy philanthropist, offering to take indigents to form an ideal colony. Onceat sea, the “colonists” would board an Allied ship. A captured German sub wouldthen torpedo the empty vessel in shallow U.S. waters. Subsequent outrage wouldforce government to retaliate. It says something about the scope of his thoughtsin combatting American apathy and confusion as regards the war.On November 14, Crowley gave an hour, starting at 10:30 p.m., to an opus withone Elsie Edwards, described thus: “Obese Irish prostitute of maternal Taurustype” who received three dollars for her services. The Object was “thanksgiving”for the glory of the phallus “and the Establishment of the Holy Kingdom in thiscountry.” “The unattractiveness of the assistant made the operation difficult,”commented Crowley. “But it was necessary to begin somehow and so far New Yorkhas shown me none of its sex side. May the Lord grant me favour in this also.”Reading over the record fourteen months later, he noted, on January 26, 1916,“The Lord granted it: blessed be He.” Crowley criticized his performance thus:“I find myself apt to concentrate on the articulation of the words thatformulate the Will rather than on the substance of the Will itself. This issurely (a priori) wrong.”Two days later, on November 16, Crowley felt the itch for a male lover. Apossibility had appeared on the horizon, but Crowley wanted someone whoresembled sometime homosexual partner Cambridge entertainer Herbert CharlesJerome Pollitt, and Opus VI’s Object was to attract “him.” Crowley concentratedagain on Babalon as the “love” of the most beloved and on her as the “body” ofthe most beloved, and the result astounded Crowley, though on January 28, 1916,he concluded that the man was “not worthy of the name.” Whoever he was, he leftthe mage disappointed and frustrated.On November 21 he concluded that there might have been something to Opus III,performed in London on October 14 with Violet Duval and Leila Bathurst for“health.” “The most anxious solicitude fails to discover any fault in the leg.This is a month earlier than the doctor’s prognostic.” Eight days later he againconsidered his health in terms of Opus III. “Not perfectly well, this leg. Butgeneral health throughout better than I have known it for years.” Crowley seemsto have had most success with sex magick, as he perceived it, with ritesrelating to health.Money was another thing. People who knew Crowley well recalled how he alwaysseemed to get just enough money to survive when hope seemed vain. On November23, Opus VIII introduced the idea that perhaps operations should be done whenthe planets looked propitious. His partner this time was a “low” prostitute, amulatto with strongly “negroid” features named Grace Harris, aged twenty-two anda “Venus in Crab type.” The Object: “Immediate money. (Interpreted as from anunexpected source before Sunday; a wish contrary to all probability.)” Two dayslater, “a letter came saying £800 was being found for me. But does this count[implying it was from an expected source]?” From whom this letter came or whatbecame of the very large sum mentioned, we know not. He would remark on December1 regarding the opus, “Not a cent! Yet I seem to be swimming in gold. I have aflat, and bought £150 furniture &c &c &c. [as we shall see shortly]. And Jonesfrom Vancouver [Charles Stansfeld Jones, running an O.T.O. Lodge in BritishColumbia] sends twelve people ready to take III° O.T.O.” That meant some feesforthcoming. On December 6 he noted there was only “$15 between me and thework’us.*73 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft73] And I owe $200.” On December 15 hecould only make the weak point that despite debt, he had obtained credit,concluding, “I shall call this doubtful.”Doubtful indeed. Crowley’s immediate financial concerns were tied up witharrangements made or supposed with John Quinn. Crowley’s expectationsundoubtedly overreached what Quinn was actually offering. For a start, Quinnexpected the shipping costs for the manuscripts Crowley ordered over fromEngland for his perusal to be borne by Crowley, and the money paid to Crowleywas intended as an “advance,” technically to be repaid if Quinn chose not to buyafter inspecting the goods. Crowley, meanwhile, had already moved from the St.Regis to the cheaper Hotel Wolcott at 4 West 31st Street when Quinn wrote to himon December 1.Dear Mr. Crowley,I received your letter of this date enclosing key of the hamper containing themanuscripts and a list of the manuscripts. I am sending the key to Messrs.Pritchard & Company, together with a copy of the list of contents. I will letyou know when the hamper is cleared and ready for delivery.Very truly yours,John Quinn3 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt174]Ever optimistic, Crowley rashly considered the advance a sign of fortunejustifying his taking on a rented apartment at 40 West 36th Street, to whichaddress Quinn’s secretary, John Watson, sent a confirmation of Crowley’sapparent debt to Quinn on December 18.Dear Mr. Crowley,I have today sent Messrs. Pritchard & Company Mr. Quinn’s check for $28.40 inpayment of freight, insurance, broker’s charges, custom house entry, etc., inconnection with shipment of MSS recently received by you. This makes yourindebtedness to Mr. Quinn $258.40. Mr Quinn sends his kind regards.Yours very truly,John Watson4 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt175]Crowley also used John Quinn’s name as a credit reference for bills he wasrunning up for furniture and other goods for the apartment, as is shown by twoletters sent from Quinn’s office on December 4. The first addressed a Mr. Perryat the credit department of the big department store B. Altman & Co., at FifthAvenue and 34th Street. Quinn sent the same letter to the Globe Wernicke Co. at380 Broadway, flagship retailer of bookcases and office furniture.Dear Sirs,I have received yours of December 3rd.I have known Mr. Crowley for some little time, particularly as a poet and man ofletters. I do not personally know of his financial means or resources. I believehim to be honest and I believe that he would not undertake an obligation that hedid not expect and feel competent and able to pay.Yours very truly,John Quinn5 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt176]Having attempted to improve his finances by sex magick, Crowley next thoughthe’d dedicate Opus IX on November 25 to “Eloquence,” as he had to give a lectureon Buddhism on Sunday 29th. Circumstances were peculiar and written details were“prohibited,” as a form of XI° or homosexual magick was employed, the occasionbeing completely unexpected. As for the result: “I was certainly fluent [at thelecture], and not self-conscious. On the whole much better than I had hoped.Yes: I will call this Success.” But surely Crowley could have made a good stabat the lecture without resorting to magick? One gets the sense that he was usingmagick for “performance enhancement,” to cope with anxiety and a dip inself-confidence: something that could, unfortunately, become habitual—though hemight argue that he would have wanted sex anyway, and it was his true will toraise it to the “Great Work.”The reference to the Buddhism lecture is interesting because shortly afterwardthe name of thoroughly remarkable multimillionaire Aimée Gouraud (née AmyCrocker 1864–1941) entered Crowley’s sex magick diary.Returning from many an adventure in the Far East in the 1890s, the delightfully“unmoral” (not, by her own estimation, “immoral”) Aimée would marry for thesecond time Jackson Gouraud amid a Buddhist community she founded—apparently thefirst—in New York in the 1890s, the heyday of intellectual occultism andParisian interest in Far Eastern religion. The very colorful Aimée, sometimefriend of Oscar Wilde, seems to have already known the very colorful Crowley andhis reputation as an occult scholar and steamy practitioner of disturbingmagnitude, responding to his magnetic appeal in her own suck-it-and-see fashion.The Buddhism lecture then may have been her doing. It is also possible thatCrowley had at some point initiated Aimée Gouraud into the O.T.O., because herefers to her as a IX°.image [images/9781620556313_030.jpg]Fig. 13.1. Aimée Gouraud (Crocker) with snakeimage [images/9781620556313_031.jpg]Fig. 13.2. Aimée Gouraud (née Crocker, 1864–1941)The Buddhism lecture set for November 29 was preceded the day before by anothermagical rite, Opus X, this time for Babalon “made flesh,” a rite performed with“full hands” to obtain the Scarlet Woman. Next morning Crowley received a letterfrom a Stanford lady seeking employment as private secretary (more expense!). OnFebruary 2, 1916, he reflected that her description, “hair ashen and greying,”was surprisingly applicable to she who did in fact secure office as ScarletWoman: Jeanne Robert Foster. In 1920, Crowley claimed that Jeanne’s dyeing ofher hair to maintain the lustrous red and gold of her youth had deflated himsomehow: a niggling fissure between his yearnings and the ideal.On December 1, Crowley finalized arrangements for moving from the Wolcott to 40West 36th Street—a couple of blocks from the Morgan Library. Whether Opus XI for“Magnetism” was performed around 10:45 p.m. at the Wolcott, or at a room held byprostitute Grace Harris, is unknown. Crowley’s Object was “that concentrationand radiation of magical force which draws men after one.” “The work was lackingin orgiastic quality,” wrote Crowley, “but good as to sacramentalism andconcentration. Latter very good; the mind faltered once only.” As to result, henoted the rite was followed by a “bad night,” so he used the time packing, whichsuggests he was still at the hotel.Quite without thinking—the ideal magical state it would seem—he picked upMagnetism by Jules Denis, Baron du Potet (1796–1881), a gift from the late JohnYarker. Yarker had introduced Crowley to the Ancient & Primitive Rite ofFreemasonry and, thereby, to the Ordo Templi Orientis. Praised by Éliphas Lévifor applying Mesmerism to occult research, sometime London homeopath du Potetwas a favorite of Theosophical Society founder Helena Blavatsky. She drew on hisIntroduction to the Study of Animal Magnetism (1838) and Magic Unveiled andOccult Science (1852), the latter work also favored by Victor Hugo, perhaps forits accommodation of spiritism. What fascinated Crowley was simply the linkbetween rite and the phenomenon of the book coming to hand.On December 4 he reckoned the rite had worked all right—but “the wrong wayround”! He was either a turn off, or else it was a woman he’d attracted!“Everything that depended on that went wrong. But I see signs of change thismorning.” While he would conclude on December 13 that the operation had been“thoroughly bad” due to lack of “proper orgia”—“The ‘calm mind’ is no good atall for Magick”—he would find himself praised by the luscious Aimée Gouraud,Ernest Simmons, and Mitchell Kennerley for precisely that glamour of “Magnetism”on December 6.The occasion was a dinner party in connection with a lecture on Magick at 32West 58th Street, close to Central Park, now demolished. The event rather openedup the Christmas rush in New York society and good will was plentiful. Who wouldnot desire to hear the voice of one of the magi at the cradle of a new aeon atsuch a time?Were things picking up for the man whose day began at 10:35 a.m. with a solorite, concentrating on Babalon and taking the sun’s vice-regent on Earth intohis hands, formulating the will whose Object was “Success tonight”—the lecture?It is not clear whether the dinner took place before or after the lecture. Onemight suppose after, on account of the magnetism perceived by Aimée Gouraud,Ernest Simmons, and Mitchell Kennerley. One tends to radiate more after asuccessful talk.Ernest E. Simmons (1884–1966) served as Elbert Hubbard’s secretary and businessassociate at the Roycroft organization, East Aurora’s ideal arts and craftscommunity referred to disdainfully by Crowley in his “Art in America.” Simmons’semployer, Hubbard, would die tragically in the Lusitania atrocity five monthslater.image [images/9781620556313_032.jpg]Fig. 13.3. Mitchell Kennerley (right, 1878–1950) with journalist ChristopherMorley (1890–1957)John Quinn’s friend Mitchell Kennerley (1878–1950), correspondent of FrankHarris, Arnold Bennett, and D. H. Lawrence, migrated from Burslem,Staffordshire, to establish himself in New York as art dealer and publisher ofworks by Oscar Wilde, H. G. Wells, Walt Whitman, George Meredith, Henrik Ibsen,Edna St. Vincent Millay, but not—alas—Aleister Crowley. It seems, however, thatKennerley did get Crowley’s hopes up that night. The Yorke Collection, WarburgInstitute, London, holds a set of proofs of Crowley’s poetry collection TheGiant’s Thumb (1915), under the Kennerley imprint, which suggests something cameof the encounter, though the project never reached fruition.*74[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft74]As for Aimée Gouraud, one rather hopes her reputation energized collectiveenthusiasm at the dinner. It hadn’t been long since she’d hosted the wildest,luxuriant parties at her strikingly adapted, Eastern-styled house at 46 West65th Street. In June she’d married fourth husband (so far) Russian aristocratAlexandre Miskinoff and was officially living with him at a suite in the McAlpinHotel, but by early 1915 they were effectively separated, so Aimée may have beenwell off the leash that night, keen to party.Result for Crowley: “Really a marked success. Pouring rain, and I had a badcough. Yet this left me while I spoke and I was eloquent. (Yet this impressionis mostly subjective.) I spoke without notes, yet never faltered. Truly say I,Let there be glory and thanksgiving to the Holy One! N.B. Abramelin demons didtheir utmost to stop this lecture. A 70-mile gale blew and they tried to upsetme both physically and mentally.”Who were these Abramelin demons? One cannot be entirely sure that Crowley was inearnest in attributing meterological phenomena to such agencies. When working onpreliminaries for the Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin the Mage at Boleskine in early1900, the process of making talismans had released, he believed, negativelycharged, so to speak, entities into the world, hell-bent on mischief. Suchunruly spiritual creatures were supposed to be at his command, but Crowleyinfers a tendency among them to stir things up when he wasn’t “on the case.” Hemight well have been pulling legs, but there was a period in the 1940s whenliving in Jermyn Street, St. James’s, he couldn’t bear to have the Abra-Melinbook in his room, so depressive and disturbing seemed to be the forcesassociated with the magic squares secreted within it. He was also suggestingthat no serious positive occult event occurs without spiritually negativeresistance of some kind, and he had plenty.image [images/9781620556313_033.jpg]Fig. 13.4. Aimée Gouraud with Prince Alexandre MiskinoffI’ve read the story of the “demonic” gale many times over the years and wonderedwhether Crowley had made up the whole story for effect. I consulted thoseoracles of unvarnished truth, the newspapers.The Sun’s forecast for New York State published early on Sunday, December 6,1914, had only a hint of disturbance, with an afternoon temperature of 32°Fpredicted. “For eastern New York, rain or snow in the south, partly cloudy incentral and northern portions today and tomorrow; strong northeast winds.” Notethe winds forecasted! “New York, Dec. 6—The southern storm lost much of itsforce, and moving eastward was central off the coast of South Carolinayesterday. . . . In this city, the [previous] day was partly cloudy and colder,wind, brisk to high northeast; average humidity, 57 percent.” Monday’s Tribunewas packed with war news: British and German gains and a pictorial magazineillustrated with ugly war photographs and images from “German war artists’sketchbooks.” There was a lack of confidence in U.S. Secretary of the NavyDaniels, and many charming advertisements for Christmas presents of all kinds.For the “Abra-Melin” effect one need only consult the Monday, December 7,Evening World final edition: the day after the lecture. The front page bannerheadline read: TERRIFIC GALE CAUSES GREAT DAMAGE ALL ALONG COAST. Below thisheadline was a huge photo-graph of Kaiser Wilhelm with his staff officers inspiked helmets next to the headline BIG GUNS RAKE ENTIRE GERMAN LINE; BATTLE ONFROM SEA TO THE ARGONNE—ALLIES ROLLING BACK KAISER’S GREAT ARMY, SAY PARISOFFICIALS. To the left of the story of Germans seizing Lodz in Poland “by pointof bayonet” was the second lead story: $25,000 SEAGATE COTTAGE SWEPT AWAY BYHIGH SEA; DAMAGE ALL ALONG COAST “Piers and Bulkheads on Coney Beach Smashed byTerrific Waves—Fight to Save Homes—Tide Near Record Mark Helps Gale inDestruction—New Storm on the Way. . . . Terrific seas, backed by a mightyflood-tide and twenty-four hours of a northeast gale, fell upon the nearbyAtlantic coast today, sweeping away houses, flooding villages, wrecking big andsmall boats and tearing great gullies through waterfront streets, lawns, andparking. The storm, which is raging from Hatteras to Maine, has not yet blownitself out, according to the Weather Bureau at Washington; the only changepredicted is that the direction of the gale will shift to the northwest. Thecity’s Seaside Park at Coney Island became a lake early in the day. . . . FromSixth Street to Ocean Parkway [in Seabright] houses stood in from one to threefeet of water.”As if this pandemonium was not enough, turn to page 3: “Plain NOISE KillingHundreds in New York; Causes Insanity and Deafness, Says Mrs. Rice.” Automobilehorns made people close windows night and day, ruining their health. Clearly,the demons were out and about. Mrs. Rice was staying indoors.image [images/9781620556313_034.jpg]Fig. 13.5. Astrologer Evangeline AdamsFive days later (December 11), another forthright, less febrile New YorkerEvangeline Smith Adams (born Jersey City 1859) was on the witness standtestifying at a fortune-telling trial. It wasn’t quite the Witches of Salem, butfortune-telling by astrology was bound by legal restrictions and was not aprofession to be pursued freely, especially where money was involved. Miss Adamswas about to enter Aleister Crowley’s universe, and taking risks for occultscience was a good way to get past first post. She testified:I am writing a book on astrology. I am holding it over simply for futureinformation. All the balance of the book is finished. I should have published itlast year but I wanted to find more facts to give my colleagues about Neptune.6[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt177]The judge was doubtless grateful. The jury, like most of society, definitelylacked facts about Neptune, but Miss Adams was not strictly relating the factsof the case, for the book she had been working on, apparently withpsychotherapist Dr. David Seabury (1885–1960),*75 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft75]was very far from finished: for that she would need Aleister Crowley. And fate,through the magic of newspaper print, was about to bring them together.JOHN O’HARA COSGRAVE, EVANGELINE ADAMS, AND FRANK CROWNINSHIELDOn the morning of Sunday, December 13, Crowley woke up to the delight of knowinga curious form of light relief from war news awaited readers of the New YorkWorld’s Sunday Magazine. An intriguing article began on page 9: MASTER MAGICIANREVEALS WEIRD SUPERNATURAL RITES. New York World Sunday editor John O’HaraCosgrave had first sent a regular features reporter (probably Marguerite MooersMarshall) to interview the latest arrival to New York’s cultural high life.Marshall having been dismissed as a “sob sister” by Crowley, Cosgrave thoughtbetter of it. “He then sent Henry Hall,” Crowley recalled, “who had married aFrench wife and learnt courtesy. He had read a good deal of good stuff andpossessed natural intelligence. I found him charming.”7[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt178]Former London Times correspondent Henry Noble Hall (1872–1947) had widejournalistic experience in the United States, England, and France. Sympatheticto Zionism, he corresponded with Chaim Weizmann, and when America joined theAllies in 1917, Hall was accredited to the American Army, experience evinced inThe Fourth Division: Its Services and Achievements in the World War, cowrittenwith Colonel Christian A. Bach. Its first chapter should engage anyone wonderingwhy America entered World War I. The chapter focuses on the very field in whichCrowley was, by stages, involving himself. Hall writes thatGerman officials violated American laws, incited labor troubles in munitionsplants and paid for the placing of bombs on vessels thus destroying Americanlives and property on the high seas. The German government fanned anti-Americanfeeling in Mexico and fomented Irish revolutionary plots, against Great Britain,in the United States. It filled unsuspecting communities and even Governmentoffices with spies.8 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt179]Hall was just as forthright about Crowley. Syndicated, his reasoned articlereintroduced the mage to America.Aleister Crowley, who recently arrived in New York, is the strangest man I evermet. He is a man about whom men quarrel. Intensely magnetic, he attracts peopleor repels them with equal violence. His personality seems to breed rumors.Everywhere they follow him.One man to whom I spoke of him lauded Crowley as a poet of rare delicacy, theauthor of “Hail Mary,” a garland of verse in honor of the Mother of God. Anotheralluded to him as an unsparing critic of American literature. Another knew himas the holder of some world records for mountain-climbing. Still another warnedme against him as a thoroughly bad man, a Satanist or devil-worshipper steepedin black magic, the high priest of Beelzebub. An actor knew of him only as atheatrical producer and as the designer of extraordinary stage costumes. Apublisher [Mitchell Kennerley?] told me that Crowley was an essayist andphilosopher whose books, nearly all privately issued, were master-pieces ofmodern printing. Among his works is a voluminous treatise on the history andpractice of magic, representing immense research and erudition—the authoritativebook on the subject. By others he was variously pictured to me as a big gamehunter, as a gambler, as an editor, as an explorer. Some said that he was a manof real attainments, others that he was a faker. All agreed that he wasextraordinary.The first time I saw Crowley he was standing in the lobby of the uptown hotelwhere he lives. I knew at once that he was the man I wanted, and instead ofgoing to the desk I went right up and spoke to him. He took me to his room andbegan to talk of an article by Harry Kemp, which the World Magazine publishedlast August, wherein was described a black mass at which Crowley was said tohave officiated as priest. He said: “Kemp honestly believes he was present atthe things he describes, but he wasn’t. I merely made him dream a scene of blackmagic, and he thought it was actually happening and that I was participating. Hedreamed himself. I don’t practise black magic.”“But do you believe in magic?” I asked, “Do you claim to have supernaturalpowers?” Crowley turned his piercing black eyes upon me, smiled, and in a verysweet, low voice said, “There is nothing supernatural about magic, any more thanthere is about wireless telegraphy. The earnest student of the occult profitsmentally and physically, and develops capacity for intellectual enjoyment notpossessed by the ordinary mortal. Magic gets me anything I want—with thelimitation, of course, that I must not use my powers to do anything that wouldbreak my oath. Each man has an original oath, which depends on the grade of hisinitiation. But all Magi are bound to poverty, chastity, and obedience.”Since our first meeting I have seen a good deal of Crowley, and although Icannot pretend to solve the bewildering riddle of his character, yet I know himas a very refined and courtly man, deeply versed in the history and principlesof all religions, a scientific student of occult-ism, a leading Freemason andpast master Rosicrucian, and as a poet of inspiration. Whether singing thepraises of Our Lady in chaste and mystic verse, or lashing the sins of modernBabylon with furious invective, or deriding degeneracy, or extollingesotericism, his lines are never labored. What blemishes there are, are theblemishes of haste. He told me that he wrote down just what came to him, andprinted it without changing a word. His most finished poetry is written inFrench, and takes the form of sonnets which might have come from the pen ofEdmond Harcourt or Paul Verlaine.One day as we were sitting together in his room talking of the war he told methat he knew beforehand it would come on, and that as far back as May, 1910, thespirit of Mars, which he had “called up, had prophesied that there would be twowars in five years, in one of which Turkey, and in the other Germany, would bedisastrously involved.” Of course I wanted to know all about his magicinformant. This is what he told me, as I remember his words.“A magician evokes a particular spirit by a special ceremonial rite. He worksfor a given result and does not, like the spiritualists, wait for some spirit toturn up and become the slave of whatever does turn up. Once within his magiccircle, the magician is master. The spirits must obey. What follows, believe ornot, as you please.“It was in London [May 9, 1910]. Three of us—myself, a British naval officer ofhigh rank [Commander Guy Marston], and a famous violinist [LeilaBathurst]—decided to evoke the spirit of Mars [“Bartzabel”]. By Mars we don’tmean the planet in the sky, at all; we mean the hidden forces that possess thepowers we attribute to Mars. Also we performed no sacrifice. In the old dayswhen the Israelites went out to give battle they would sacrifice an animal, butnowadays it is not necessary to shed blood. You use the proper incense, and thebeings you want materialize from the smoke.“As we were going to evoke the spirit of Mars I used a blood-red robe and worethe crown of the Uraeus serpent and armed myself with the sword and the spear.My two assistant Magi were clad in white and gold.“Around the altar we had traced a large circle, ample in size to contain thethree of us. And then, following the ancient rites, we consecrated the spear,and then the sword, and then the altar, and lastly the magic circle itself. Solong as we remain inside that circle no harm could come to us. Once we weresecure we conjured the Dog of Evil, just as the minister exorcises the spiritsof evil before laying the foundation stone of a church, and having done that webound ourselves by a great oath to the purposes of the ceremony. That is one ofthe most important things.“And as the clouds of incense rose from the altar we lifted up our voices andpraised the God of Battle. We invoked the Egyptian God Horus and called uponElohim Gebor to aid us. And then as I felt the power within me grow I commandedthe blind spirit Bartzabel to come forth.“The dark clouds of incense slowly took form and, standing without the circle, asexless oxlike form appeared, with dull, deceitful head and hideous humanfeatures suffused with blood. It stood panting, its heart beating violently, andin a deep, hoarse voice it answered my questions. Is said that in less than fiveyears there would be two wars, and prophesied that the greatest of the two wouldend by the crushing of Germany.”Crowley told me all this in as matter of fact a manner as if he had beendescribing an experiment by Edison or Marconi, and as he spoke he puffed slowlyat a briarwood pipe with a very short bowl and a very long amber mouthpiece.He is a well-knit, athletic man, on the verge of forty, standing 5 feet 11 inhis boots and weighing 158 pounds. It is possible to describe him exactly sofar, but no further.One can imagine Crowley’s delight with the article: no hysteria, no sobstory.*76 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft76] His instinct was to offer thanks forthe good things. This he did as Opus XIII, performed that Sunday afternoon at2:35 p.m. with low-class mulatto prostitute, twenty-two-year-old Grace Harris.The composite Object was “To become One with the Lord.” Crowley added, “Thingshad cleared up for me this morning. World article, date with Quinn [for December16] &c. So this was my weekly Thanksgiving Service; and therefore by this objectI meant (1) to worship the Holy One by identity, (2) to make others worship me.”By the “Lord” here, Crowley was referring to Hermes as “lord” of the Grade towhich he aspired, Magus 9° = 2▫, and also as the caduceus, the staff entwined bytwin serpents, surmounted by winged globe: wand of New York’s god; as Hermeticquicksilver semen in the sense of the “carrier of the Word” or “Logos,” thecommunicated essence of God; also as the rod or wand of the divine messenger—theHermetic phallus.Late antique philosophy understood the divine essence, or mind, as being sown inthe world as a seed: the logos spermatikos (“spermatic word”). For Crowley thesilvery Hermetic seed was visible sign of the Impersonal Self, or Augoeides, or“Holy Guardian Angel” that should be raised to its source sacramentally to“revivify the whole.” We can get a sense of where he was coming from when weobserve the “Result” of that afternoon’s opus. “I got a good identity-magical,not up to Samadhi [obliteration of distinction of subject and object] though—andsaw myself as Ph[allos] walking.”When Crowley shaved his head he would often leave a phallic tuft above hisforehead: sun, Horus, cock, fertility, life, love, and liberty! That was the NewAeon. Crowley would have been mightily chuffed by the discovery of the DNA modelas a double helix, like the twin serpents of Hermes’s rod. He would immediatelyhave identified it with the Hermetic caduceus, and with the two “thieves”(Hermes as trickster) on either side of Christ at the “place of the skull.” Hehad been surprised to perceive an identity of Hermes with Christ during theParis Working in January and February.The rite completed in “orgiastic” spirit, Crowley seems to have got out onto thestreets, for he reports, in light of his vision of himself as a walking phallus,that at 4:50 p.m. one Dorothy von Palmerburg “fell straight down for me,”however we might interpret that.It would appear that an evening party had been laid on for him to celebrate hismoment of newspaper fame, for he records being in the swing at 9:00 p.m. thatnight (December 13). Had he a spare moment between Dorothy and the party, hemight just have caught page 2 of Sunday’s New York Tribune, headlined GERMANSPIES COST SCHWAB MILLIONS. Highly relevant to his preoccupations, the storydescribed the kind of thing one suspects had ostensibly brought him to New Yorkin the first place.According to the Tribune, Germans in New York and Washington in and out of thediplomatic service were checking over a story said to involve Charles M. Schwab,president of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, and the German Secret Service.Schwab had recently returned from a mysterious flying visit to England with acertified check for $6 million. He “little dreamed” that German Secret Serviceefficiency would lose him the largest individual order that had ever beenobtained for his concern and that he would have to return to the Britishgovernment the 10 percent deposit of $6 million that had clinched the order. Mr.Schwab was said to have crossed the Atlantic on the Olympic under an assumedname. A special train had apparently carried retired steel king Schwab fromLough Swilly in Ireland to London. But before the Mauretania had reached SandyHook, the State Department had full knowledge of the transaction. On arrival,Secretary of State Bryan invited Schwab to Washington to tell him that executionof the contract violated the neutrality proclamation of Woodrow Wilson. “ThatGermany has a large staff of active agents in neutral countries, who openlycarry on a lively propaganda in her behalf, is well known,” declared theTribune, adding that the most important work was undertaken by secret agents.“The efforts of American bankers a few weeks ago to negotiate a loan to theAllies was promptly communicated to the German government, which immediatelyinstructed its diplomatic representatives here to protest to President Wilson.”This all sounds like background to Crowley’s “addled egg” and undoubtedlydemonstrates the background work of the Propaganda Kabinett, whose aim it was toshow Americans the “sound logic” of strict neutrality and, failing that, tobully them into it.Crowley was in good spirits that Sunday night: a welcome relief. According tohis sex magick diary, around 9:00 p.m. he “had a great time doing good magic andgetting the people interested.” Aimée Gouraud was, in particular, “very cordialindeed.” Crowley also had his eye on “another victim, red hair and Aires Ithink.” He wondered if she might be the manifest result of Opus X for theScarlet Woman. “Perhaps X at last!” Thirteen months later he would have toobserve, “All this latter part failed.”9 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt180]It is just possible that this was the night described in the Confessions whenCrowley dined with John O’Hara Cosgrave (1864–1947), who wanted Crowley to meetastrologer Evangeline Adams.I dined at Cosegrave’s [sic] house one night. He had asked Evangeline Adams tomeet me as being a famous astrologer. The meeting led to a lengthy association.She wanted me to write a book on astrology for her.10[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt181]Sunday editor of the New York World from 1912 to 1927, Cosgrave was firmlypro-Allied, which sympathy led Spence to speculate on whether his kindness toCrowley was prompted by consideration for Crowley as an Allied intelligenceasset.11 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt182] According to Spence, New York Worldforeign affairs editor Frank Cobb was also pro-Allied, indeed a close personalfriend of future number two SIS man in the United States, Norman Thwaites.Cosgrave edited Everybody’s Magazine, which took articles from H. G. Wells andG. K. Chesterton, denizens of London’s secret Propaganda Bureau.If the December 13 gathering did include Cosgrave and Adams, it would not onlymatch the World Magazine’s Sunday puff on Crowley but also tie in with the NewYork World’s page 3 illustrated splash the following day featuring . . .Evangeline Adams! Dominated by a large photograph of the controversialastrologer, Miss Adams received the Marguerite Mooers Marshall Women’s Sectiontreatment: ASTROLOGY MORE CERTAIN IN ITS DIAGNOSIS THAN MEDICINE OR LAW, SAYSMISS ADAMS. The subheading refers to Evangeline’s aforementioned trial forfortune-telling: “Woman Declared by Court to Be No Fortune Teller Asserts thatStars Indicate What a Mortal’s Fate May Be, and Then It’s Up to the KnowledgeSeeker to Fend Off Disaster or Invite Happiness—Plans an Astrological ResearchSociety.”Ms. Marshall continues, breathlessly, “That is the theory of Miss Evangeline S.Adams, astrologist . . . says her patrons have included the late J. PierpontMorgan and F. A. Heinze . . . I talked with Miss Adams today in her richlyfurnished curio-crammed apartment on the tenth floor of the Carnegie Studios*77[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft77] . . . Miss Adams herself is a businesslikeperson, with a square, frankly middle-aged face and figure.” Ms. Marshall askedMiss Adams about whether astrology could have predicted the war. Miss Adamsreplied proudly, “Three years ago I saw that suffering and strife threatened. AsI read the planets, it will be the last war, to be followed by a realbrotherhood of man, in bringing about which the U.S. will triumph as a spiritualnation. There seems to be a chance that the war may end next spring or summer,owing to the intervention of this country, and with the Allies victorious.”“That’s fortunate I [Marguerite Mooers Marshall] observed, if the stars want thebrotherhood of man instead of the step-fatherhood of the Kaiser.”The meeting of Crowley with Evangeline Adams would entail significantconsequences. First of these would be the production of Crowley’s masterpiece onastrology, The General Principles of Astrology Liber DXXXVI. Up to that point itwas Crowley’s biggest ever work of mature prose. Its progress was, however,checkered. What started as book doctoring on what Miss Adams and Seabury hadalready lifted from other sources, became a full-scale treatise that Crowley wasstill working on in the summer of 1916. That work came to an end at the summer’sterminus when Crowley decided to cease pursuing his “service” career with Adamsor Stuart X or other occasional articles, and devote himself to being prophet ofThelema, his religio-magical system of spiritual attainment, for which work hefully believed he had been chosen by generally unseen governors of planetarydestiny.Miss Adams would wait until after Crowley’s departure to eke out of Crowley’swork two strong-selling books on astrology published under her own name with noacknowledgment whatsoever of Crowley’s far more than substantial role. The bookas Crowley intended was not in fact published until 2002, when William Breezecompleted the massive task of reassembling a prodigious work that even Crowleyreckoned long lost to fate.Another outcome of Crowley and Adams’s encounter was a renewed interest inastrology as part of his modus operandi. Only in the summer, Crowley had writtento C. S. Jones in Canada that there existed not one decent book on the subjectand that the subject was fraught with bunk. Once he got back into the subject,however, Crowley soon found that, pursued with sensitivity, it held greatpossibilities. According to the Confessions, Crowley took to enliveninggatherings in New York with remarkable exhibitions of the astrologer’s abilityto judge people’s astrological data simply from looking at them.At this time, it was my invariable practice to judge from the personalappearance of every stranger I met the sign rising at his birth. Having made upmy mind, I would ask him to tell me either the hour or the day of his birth. Icould then calculate the missing day as thus: Suppose I judge my man to haveLibra in the ascendant and he tells me his birthday is October 1st. When the sunis in 5° or 6° Libra, I can tell him he was born at sunrise, within a limit oferror of about two hours. Alternatively, should he say, “I was born atmidnight,” I can give his birthday to within a fortnight or so of Christmas. Itabulated my results over a considerable period and found that I was right in alittle over two cases in three. Where I was wrong, I found that either the signI had chosen for his ascendant was that occupied by his sun, which in somepeople determines the personal appearance more effectively than the ascendant,or else, in erecting his horoscope I found the rising sign occupied by planetswhose nature modified the sign so that it could be mistaken for the one I hadpicked out.12 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt183]It seems to have been at one such demonstration, and around this time, thatCrowley came to know and appreciate Cosgrave’s good friend Frank Crowninshield(1872–1947; strange perhaps that Crowninshield, Cosgrave, and Crowley would alldie in the same year). The elegant, Paris-born poet and aesthete Crowninshieldhad recently accepted friend Condé Nast’s invitation to assume control of VanityFair, which Crowninshield undertook to transform into the preeminent literaryjournal of America. Crowley was perhaps recalling a first or early encounterwith Crowninshield in the following passage from his Confessions.The psychological reactions to these demonstrations [of astrological nous] weremost interesting. Some people were quite unaffected by the most brilliantsuccesses. Some were scared half out of their wits, such as they had. Othersagain fell prostrate in awed admiration and jumped from the facts to the fancythat I must be a Mahatma able to juggle with the stars in their courses if thewind took me. Only a small percentage showed intelligent interest. I made agreat impression on Frank Crowninshield, editor of Vanity Fair. I was in formthat night and told everyone exactly right. He realized it could not beguessing. The chances against me ran into billions.13[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt184]If Crowninshield found Crowley impressive, the sensibility was mutual. Crowleywas charmed by the man who pulled the business up from “nothing” to a quarter ofa million readers and reminded him a little of Austin Harrison, though thelatter compared unfavorably, for Crowninshield was “extremely intelligent andunderstood his business thoroughly”: a typical Crowleyan swipe. If a piece didnot suit, Crowninshield would talk it over and make the best of it. “I thusfound out how to suit his taste without injuring my self-respect. Most editorsdrive away their best contributors by treating them like street beggars andleave them bewildered at the rejection.” Perhaps not most, but too many! “Hetreated me,” wrote Crowley, “through some inexplicable misunderstanding, as ahuman being and asked me to write for him. I began with an account of a baseballgame as seen by a professor from the University of Peking.”14[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt185] Crowley’s memory may have been a little atfault, because the extant version of the very amusing article plainly depicts aHindu at a baseball game between the Redsox and Yanks, which he describes inperfectly symbolic terms as a religious rite—a superbly effective idea thatlingers.15 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt186] It appeared in the August 1915 issueof Vanity Fair. Crowley’s memory may have been at fault as his “Royal Art”sex-magick diary shows that he received $25 for a “Climbing Article” on February2, 1915. “Aleister Crowley: Mystic and Mountaineer” appeared in Vanity Fair inJune, before the baseball article, which makes sense, as the climbing articleintroduces Crowley to Vanity Fair readers as “Irishman,” “adept,” and “esotericphilosopher.” A letter to Cosgrave of 1917 shows that Crowley tended to think ofCrowninshield and Cosgrave together and in close communication,*78[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft78] so it is very likely they first met in theChristmas season of 1914.On the day the New York Evening World carried its feature on Evangeline Adams(December 14) its front page headline declared GERMANY’S SECRET SERVICE REVEALSHUGE ARMS ORDERS IT SAYS US HAS RECEIVED . . . GUNS IN THE MILLIONS. Thesubheading elaborated: “Says [Arms] Deal Indicates Allies Expect War to Last TwoYears More.” Whatever Secretary of State Bryan might have wished, matériel wasgetting to the Allies, profits to U.S. business, and the Germans did not like itone whit. “The German secret service is working vigilantly in the U.S. todisclose the enormous orders for War Supplies placed in this country,” drummingup arguments “in favour of Germany’s demands upon President Wilson to stop theexportation of munitions of war. The Evening World has obtained the latest list. . .”The essential story could be seen two columns to the right: US Steel Jumps to55; All Other Stocks Boosted . . . “Hundreds of Employees return to Work.” Thepresident would find it tough to argue with that.That day, Monday, December 14, marks a special day in Crowley’s magical life. Iwas fortunate to have at my fingertips recently the small, pale diary,surmounted by a big bright yellow “mercury” symbol, in which can be found theColloquy†79 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft79]of VVVVV‡80[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft80]that is to be a Magus 9° = 2▫of Aimage[images/dots.jpg]Aimage [images/dots.jpg]with the God ΘΩΘ [Thoth =Hermes/Mercury]. In thick black ink can be found Crowley’s diary specific toinvocations of Mercury. “About December 14,” Crowley writes, “I came to theConclusion that image [images/9781620556313_0102.jpg] [mercury symbol] was Lordof New York, and I began various invocations of this as best I could, notably bythe O.T.O. method. I shall refer here, and after to the record ‘De Arte Regia’[‘On the Royal Art’] . . . and my very blindness and impotence—which are atpresent considerable—give me hope.”16 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt187] Crowleyknew his magical progress impended on becoming a Magus, but the process wasneither simple nor automatic. There were tests and ordeals to pass through, tocleanse his being so as to incarnate additional insights, powers ofconsciousness from “on High.”The Rex de Arte Regia record indicates that the attempted Hermetictransformation of Crowley’s consciousness and life actually began immediatelyafter Sunday’s dinner party on the night of the 13th. From that time he had been“generally invoking Hermes or Mercury as the obvious God of this city of NewYork, and proposing to make this new temple a Temple of Hermes by getting eightpeople to assist, and by making a circle on the floor, with the idea of buildingup a great Mercurial force, a mighty Caduceus to rule this city.”By 9:00 p.m. on Tuesday, December 15, the temple was ready. Crowley beganmagical invocations of Thoth and Hermes, interspersed with appropriate “EnochianCalls,” allegedly communicated by angels through Queen Elizabeth I’sastrologer-mathematician John Dee’s seer, Edward Kelley, in the early 1580s. Thepurpose was to access inner plane “Aethyrs” wherein flourished realms of symboland angelic speech, visible and audible to inner ear and eye.17[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt188] Here translated is the opening of the “Call ofthe Thirty Aethyrs,” applied in this case to “KHR,” 20th Aethyr.O YE HEAVENS which dwell in KHR, ye are mighty in the parts of the Earth, andexecute therein the judgment of the Highest! Unto you it is said: Behold theFace of your God, the beginning of Comfort, whose eyes are the brightness of theHeavens, which provided you for the Government of the Earth, and her unspeakablevariety, furnishing you with the power of understanding to dispose all thingsaccording to the Foresight of Him that sitteth on the Holy Throne . . .Or as read originally, and sonorously, by Crowley in Enochian:MADARIATZA das perifa KHR, cahisa micaolazoda saanire caosago od fifisabalzodizodarasa Iaida. Nonuça gohulime: Micama adoianu MADA iaoda beliorebe . ..18 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt189]Fascinated to acclimatize himself fully to the proposed new Hermetic current,the magician reread his account of January’s Paris Workings in which he andVictor Neuburg had invoked Mercury with some success, as they perceived it.At about twenty to midnight dark-haired Dutch prostitute Lea Dewey, whose“beautiful Yoni” with fair pubic hair that Crowley admired, was with him in thetemple. With Lea he performed Opus XIV whose Object was simply “Hermes” (writtenin Greek in the record), meaning “a general invocation of his powers: magick,wisdom, eloquence, success in business, letters, &c &c. . . . The Operation wasmost orgiastic, but I formulated the God well and called aloud after his name.The Gluten of the Eagle was not very plentiful, and the Lion not very thoroughlydissolved therein. Still, I think the Elixir was formed well enough.”A detail of the record that perhaps makes the events difficult to place is thatafter commenting that all the invocations had improved conditions for success,and noting the fine, if cold weather (10°F), he writes, “On returning to myhotel I found a dun . . .” This must mean either that the temple was notsituated where he slept, or that he had left his hotel apartment again after theopus—perhaps to escort Lea out of the building. The latter seems likely. A dunis an importunate demand for payment. It came from his dentist. Because Mercurytraditionally rules the mouth (oral communication), Crowley took it as a clue ofHermes’s presence. Signs continued: after dawn broke, he received letters fromCowie and Leila Bathurst (letters = Mercury/communication); then in theafternoon his private secretary brought into him “an ink pot, eight daggers, atray with Hermes on it, a phallic night-light hold and a Virgo tray!” These allsignified mercurial correspondences. He then adds briefly, and only as anotherproof of Hermes’s coloring of events, “Later, dined with Quinn who promised me$500 on a collection of books.”Well, this was the notable Christmas dinner at John Quinn’s home at 31 NassauStreet on December 16, 1914, where Quinn introduced Crowley to his friends JohnButler Yeats, writer and art critic Frederick James Gregg, and Quinn’s mistress,Dorothy Coates: the same Dorothy Coates whose favor for William Butler Yeats hadopened the long, bitter rift between “Willie” and Quinn, only healed up thatyear (to John Butler Yeats’s relief), due to Coates’s pleading. We may recallthat while JBY informed son Willie that he found Crowley entertaining andmagnetic—though like “all Englishmen” he was always the hero of hisstories—Crowley nonetheless seemed to him emotionally isolate, and thereforeeasily dominant. One wonders if John Butler Yeats had any idea of just howCrowley had spent the previous seventy-two hours! Perhaps that inner coldness orabsence of personal sympathy discerned by Quinn’s favorite painter was thefrost-sparkled, silvery edge left by Hermes’s having sprinkled the magician’stongue with Mercurial spirit and penetrated his mind through his backside.The next day, Quinn’s money came through. Were there any other Mercurial signsin the air? There was at least one, Crowley thought.Having decided on December 19 to “now invoke Mercury daily as of old,” Crowleyfelt it his duty to record “one of the most curious experiences of my life.”At about 8:45 p.m. he was at 34th Street and Broadway, looking for “a soul-mate,a destined bride, an affinity, a counterpartal ego &c., and should haveconsidered the conditions satisfied by any orifice into which I might plunge mypenis at a cost not exceeding $2.50. I now saw a girl who might have served butdid not think it worth while to speak, as she looked expensive.” He had a flashto go to 42nd Street, having called on Hermes eight (symbolic to Hermes) times.He found the same lady, “Mildred Rose,” a pianist. They walked back up 40thStreet until they reached a point where they stood chatting and “flirting, verymildly. I am to ring her tomorrow or she is to come to my lecture.” Miss Rose,if that was her name, never came to the lecture, and by December 28, Crowley hadconcluded that this was something attributable to “the boy trickster Mercury”reminiscent of the first Paris operation on January 1, 1914. No signs had issuedfrom the lady since, and address and phone number failed to find her. Add tothat, a fish appeared to have blocked the water main, leaving the taps “dry.”Fish, of course, are sacred to Mercury. What cheek!As for the lecture, billed somewhere for December 20, even an afternoon ritewith Lea Dewey whose Object again was “Hermes”—Crowley said that he had “nothingleft to wish for”—was a washout, despite bright sunny conditions, cold, andfrost. He says the opus was “very clumsily managed,” and he “lost control ofBindu” (semen). The mage was not feeling well and intuited all along thatsomething was wrong, and in the event, the lecture was hopeless. “The wholeMercury force has been—to all appearance—thrown down instantly.” No one turnedup but those he brought with him (no names, sadly). Even after an afternoonspent invoking Mercury, “brother” Frater F. L. (?) didn’t show up (and he wasexpected to assist with Mercury invocations in the evening), nor did his privatesecretary, nor “faithful Rooney.” Perhaps Hermes preferred different companythat night.He gave Hermes another go, by himself, on December 22 just after nine o’clock,and felt he’d made a reasonable fist at it, correcting errors in the previousrite. The next day he turned to Grace Harris’s services again. He hoped toacquire “the mantle of David and Solomon” so that he could write some greatpsalms and canticles. He realized with welcome humor that “a quarter-fledgedMagus should not try for miracles of this size. ‘Let him kiss me with the kissesof his mouth: for thy love is better than wine’ has been written; and if theO.T.O. Magick can equal that . . .!!!”*81 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft81] Onreturning home he began three psalms, woke up at 5:30 a.m. and wrote some more,then was “at it again” twelve hours later. After penning sixteen, the “currentseemed to stop.” One wonders if David endured similar fits and starts.The week before Christmas, Crowley got himself embroiled in a conflict with thenotoriously troublesome Madame Frida Strindberg. Her venomous tongue apparentlyslandered Crowley to popular author and Brentano’s Publishers rare books expert,Temple Scott (1869–1934).Who was this Madame Strindberg, and what was she doing in New York?Divorced by Swedish playwright August Strindberg in 1895 after barely two yearsof marriage—the playwright found her too interfering in hisbusiness—out-to-shock Austrian Frida feinted suicide (regularly) then went toLondon where she founded in 1912 the notorious “Cave of the Golden Calf” and itsCabaret Theatre Club on Haddon Street, filling it with futurist paintings byWyndham Lewis, Spencer Gore, and Charles Ginner; phallic sculpture by JacobEpstein; and raucous ragtime music. The club attracted artist rebels likeKatherine Mansfield, Ford Madox Ford, and Crowley’s friend Augustus John, whomFrida pursued until John was driven nearly mad. She also seduced Wyndham Lewis,founder of the Blast Vorticist magazine and designer of the club’s Vorticistposter.19 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt190] Madame famously waved men away withthe words, “I’ll sleep with you, but don’t ask me to talk to you. One must drawthe line somewhere.” Madame Strindberg quit London in 1914 for the UnitedStates, acquiring a screen-writing job with Fox Film. She was certainly notpopular with everybody in the United States as this letter from John Quinn tofriend, author, and art, literary, theater, and music critic James Huneker(1857–1921) in Brooklyn demonstrates. The letter, written on December 26, alsosuggests that Crowley was becoming a bit of a nuisance to Quinn, though Crowley,note, is not held responsible for the debacle.My dear James,Crowley called up my office several times last week. Each time I was “busy” orout. Finally his secretary began to call, and then Watson got the news that hewanted to consult me on a legal matter. It appears that Madame Strindberg hasbeen slandering him to Temple Scott of Brentano’s and somebody else, tellingthem what a fearful man he was in London or God knows what. I can imagine myselfdefending a guilty correspondent in a divorce case; I can imagine myselfdefending a criminal or even a murderer if the court assigned me to the job; Ican imagine myself having a prostitute for a client; I can imagine myselfdefending a nigger or chinaman where the facts appealed to me. But I cannotimagine myself having anything, even remotely, to do with a legal squabblebetween a woman whose friends call her a slut and a man whose enemies call him abugger. There are some limits. Damn her, she seems to be always making mischief!And the funny thing about it is that Crowley about two weeks ago when I saw himcasually, spoke about her as sweetly as possible; said that “she wasn’t a badsort at all”; that he feared she was “up against it”; that he would do anythinghe could to help her; and that at heart she wasn’t bad, and that he hoped shewould get along well. Crowley isn’t a bad sort. I know nothing about himpersonally. He is not a great poet. There is a good deal of the over-grown boyabout him.The last that I heard of Madame S. in London was that she had taken up withWyndham Lewis. He is the man who was the chief chap in the Blast. It is too badhe didn’t turn on his blast and blight and blister the bitch, and in her larynxa galling give her.20 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt191]Apparently unfazed by ructions with Frida Strindberg, Crowley made no mention ofthe fuss in his diary. But that only reveals the problem with trying toreconstruct Crowley’s biography from extant sex magick diaries alone; they arecompletely inadequate to that purpose, even though they candidly deal withintimate matters most diaries seldom reveal.Crowley seems to have taken a Christmas break, not that he believed in Christmasparticularly. His parents insisted that it was a “pagan” festival, and they didnot take much notice of it; certainly trees were not in evidence at the familyhome. One might have thought its pagan association might have attracted Crowleyto Christmas excess. He would not have found much encouragement from theChristmas Eve edition of the Evening World. GERMANS WIPED OUT AT JOFFRE’S ORDERIN VOLLEY OF 600 GUNS roared the seasonal headline, while on page 2, beneathHindenburg’s capture of Polish city Lodz, was a cartoon headed (in Gothicscript), “The Three Wise Men of the West and their Star of Hope.” The threerobed figures stood on the North American part of a globe in space, each with asash inscribed, respectively, Humanitarianism, Democracy, and Neutrality. In theheavens above, a female figure opened her beckoning arms to reveal the wordPEACE, beaming to all, but untouched.The Tribune played the game. Its front page featured a photograph of a hugeChristmas tree in Madison Square, pocked with electric lights in the city’sdarkness. Next to it stood a native Indian with a sheet of music:“Os-ke-now-ton, a Mohawk Indian, Soloist in the Celebration.” The headlines:CITY GLOWS WITH FESTAL DAY JOYS; TREE OF LIGHT; SPARKLING THROUGH SNOW; and GLADSONGS SYMBOLS OF NEW YORK’S THANKFULNESS FOR PEACE AND HAPPINESS THIS CHRISTMAS.Another little headline:: WHITE CHRISTMAS ON WEATHER MENU—not the song; thathadn’t been written yet. The saddest thing was page 8: a cartoon sketch of aGreek hoplite, teeth bared in helmet, astride the globe in greaves of war,wielding a massive sword over an Earth enveloped in flames. Beneath it: “War onearth; ill-will to men.”Life, for some, goes on. Grace Harris was called for service again on the 27th:“object held tenaciously and the God-form fairly well sustained. The Elixir wasexcellent and ample.” Crowley did feel he had, as Neuburg used to put it, “gotThoth” and business went well enough the next day, whatever it may have been.We know at least part of that business involved calling on Quinn in the morning,for Quinn wrote a friendly letter to Crowley on that day (December 28) to thankhim for a seasonal gift.Dear Mr. Crowley,I don’t know what you will think of my not having thanked you personally whenyou called at the office this morning for your Christmas letter and for the MS.of your story the “King of Terrors.” I should have answered you last Saturdaybut I was so driven that I hadn’t a moment’s time.I am grateful for your good wishes and I hope you will have nothing but goodluck during the coming year. I am very much obliged to you for sending me theMS. Which I shall value the more highly as a personal gift from you.Sincerely yours,John Quinn21 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt192]It was nearly 11:00 p.m. on December 30 when Crowley and Lea Dewey got down, orup, to business again, this time with “Sex attraction” as the Object. Crowleywas on considerably better form; the Elixir was of “super-excellent quality.”However, he felt judgment was influenced too much by pleasure, and theexpectation of results “palsied.” Nevertheless, on January 2 Aimée Gouraud“called here of her own accord,” so there was a glimmer of light in midwinter’sgloom as the new year of 1915 began.One suspects that Crowley was lonely that Christmas, though a little break inthe clouds occurred on New Year’s Day with an invitation to dine that day withQuinn, John Butler Yeats, and Quinn’s friend modernist art critic F. J. Gregg.We know this from a letter Quinn wrote to John Butler Yeats’s son Jack, also apainter, on the last day of 1914. The letter has additional interest in thatQuinn gives his concise view of his views of the war and mentionssocialist-anarchist trades unionist Larkin, whom Crowley heard speak in Londonin November 1913.*82 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft82]I have been seeing a great deal of your father. He had dinner with me atChristmas. He is coming up tomorrow New Years Day. Gregg is coming up and alsoAleister Crowley a “magician” who was over here, and I fear is up against itfinancially.My sympathies are with the allies in this war, although I cannot look anyIrishman in the face and say that he ought to go out and fight on the side ofthe allies because England gave them home rule or any other reason like that. Isaid to Horace Plunkett ten days ago that if Nationalist Irishmen were notenlisting in Ireland in satisfactory numbers it was because of the birds cominghome to roost; that the Carsonites were not going out and getting themselveskilled but were keeping their skins whole to renew the fight and treason whenthe war was over. I feel, and well informed men agree with me that the man mostresponsible for this war is Carson.*83 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft83] He and theKaiser had a personal interview within the year. The Kaiser reasoned thatEngland would not fight because her army was honeycombed with treason and thatshe was split open on the Ulster question and so on. Of course he was wrong.. . . Larkin is out here too. I hear vaguely of him making fiery speeches beforepro-German–Irish audiences. Casement has gone over to Berlin, legally committingtreason; actually making it impossible for him to do anything for Ireland inIreland with the volunteers or anybody either during the war or after the war. Itold him that his place was in Ireland.22 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt193]Jack’s brother, William Butler Yeats, soon got to hear from his father aboutJohn Butler Yeats’s second meeting with Crowley, at Quinn’s New Year’s Daydinner. Old enemy, and arguably rival, of Crowley, W. B. Yeats was none toopleased, offering his father his opinion of Crowley from Stone Cottage,Coleman’s Hatch, Sussex, where he was staying with fellow poet and admirer, EzraPound, and Dorothy (née Shakespear), whom Pound had recently married. Yeats’stwice-used word amused naturally suggests its opposite.I was amused by your description of Crowley. Crowley is not a man I appreciate.I am amused to find that he now praises Mrs MaGregor [sic, Moina Mathers, néeBergson], he slandered her in a very cruel way in one of his books but I supposeBergson’s sister is now worth considering. I am sorry Quinn has taken up withCrowley.23 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt194]Crowley had dedicated Carmen Saeculare to Moina Mathers back in 1900, but Yeatswould insist anything generous from Crowley was rooted in low motive. He alsoomits to mention how Yeats himself was instrumental in attacking “MrsMaGregor’s” husband and seceding from Mathers’s authority in 1900, despiteMathers having taught him much of the occultism he had been so keen to acquire,regardless of his father’s persistent attempts to drag him away from thesubject. Willie would soon offer Quinn his views on Crowley in a less “amused”manner.. . . Crowley, meanwhile, sought inspiration, and positive action, by regularinvocation of Hermes in New York City."},{"pageContent":"FOURTEENimage [images/9781620556313_099.jpg]Toward the FatherlandGiven the amount of time and energy Crowley put in to invoking Hermes, he musthave had great faith in the ritual. An average of three invocations a day(morning, afternoon, late evening), sometimes combined with the Lesser BanishingRitual of the Pentagram to clear the air of unholy spirits, and occasionalrecitations of Enochian Calls, were performed from New Year’s until March 10,1915. On a very few occasions, Crowley smoked opium or sipped morphine,presumably to shut out the ordinary world and enter experimentally into thespirit of things.The main invocation had been adapted from a ritual given to him by Allan Bennettfor its efficacy. It was based on a late antique exorcism ritual, translated byCharles Wycliffe Goodwin, first published in 1852 by the Cambridge AntiquarianSociety as Fragment of a Graeco-Egyptian word upon magic: from a papyrus in theBritish Museum. The original calls, with “barbarous names of evocation,” on “theHeadless One” for power to expel an evil spirit. Crowley surmised headless to bea poor Greek translation from an Egyptian original meaning “bornless”—without abeginning—so referred to his recomposed “Liber Israfel sub fugura LXIV” as the“Bornless ritual” whose first quarter begins thus:The Temple being in darkness, and the Speaker ascended into his place let himbegin by a ritual of the Enterer, as followeth.ו*84 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft84] Procul, O procul este profani.†85[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft85]Bahlasti! Ompehda!*86 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft86]In the name of the Mighty and Terrible One, I proclaim that I have banished theShells unto their habitations.I invoke Tahuti [Thoth-Hermes], the Lord of Wisdom and of Utterance, the Godthat cometh forth from the Veil.O Thou! Majesty of Godhead! Wisdom-crowned Tahuti! Lord of the Gates of theUniverse! Thee, Thee, I invoke.O Thou of the Ibis Head! Thee, Thee I invoke.Thou who wieldest the Wand of Double Power! Thee, Thee I invoke!Thou who bearest in Thy left hand the Rose and Cross of Light and Life: Thee,Thee, I invoke.Thou, whose head is as an emerald, and Thy nemmes as the night-sky blue! Thee,Thee I invoke.Thou, whose skin is of flaming orange as though it burned in a furnace! Thee,Thee I invoke.Behold! I am Yesterday, To-Day, and the Brother of To-Morrow!I am born again and and again.Mine is the Unseen Force, whereof the Gods are sprung! Which is as Life unto theDwellers in the Watch-Towers of the Universe.The words were not uttered as if addressing an audience, but as first addressingthe god, then, spoken as the god. The god’s symbolic form will have beenstudied, his attributes fully assumed, the meaning realized. Then a prayer tothe god is made until the voice of the god “comes through.” In the third part,the magician is identified with the god, and in the fourth the prayer isrepeated but as made by the god, expressing the god’s will to be manifest in themagician. The process is one of progressive exaltation, until the will of themagician and the god become indistinguishable.1 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt195]Rex de Arte Regia for January 5 gives us more detail of what Crowley was doingin his temple; that is, in his mind. He followed the invocation with “dharana”meditation on the caducaeus. He imagined its winged globe inside his skull withits staff in his spine. Dharana meant concentrating on the image without breaksof attention, until the mind was aware of nothing but the image. He did thisalmost to the point of dhyana, a high trance in which insight into a statebeyond subject and object was experienced, usually as a visionary shock. Crowleywrites, “I got a dhyana by the way, a spark of silver (left by Hermes, on whoseimage I was concentrating ere I slept) of extreme brilliance.” He hadtemporarily become a spark of Hermetic silver. This should have impelled apersonal transformation, but the magick did not seem to be working. He recalledin his Confessions:I was even unable to practise my personal Magick. An inscrutable paralysis hadme by the spine. . . . I found myself forced to a daily invocation of Mercury(the god corresponding to the Grade of Magus) with whom I did not consciouslywant to have any dealings. . . . The surprise of the situation can only beunderstood if it be remembered that during my whole life I had never failed toattract eager attention wherever I went, to bring off whatever I planned, and tofeel myself in every way a centre of electric energy.2[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt196]As well as dharana on the caducaeus, Crowley devoted January 5 to Opus XXI withGrace Harris for “sex attraction,” mindful that his last operation three daysearlier with Lea Dewey for “gift of Oratory” had failed. At an engagement onJanuary 3 his oratory had been “rotten.” Unexpectedly asked to address a clubthe following day he “got through creditably,” and on the 5th was asked torecite at a reception. Crowley couldn’t understand why his magick was soineffective. Was it in the stars? Would it improve when Jupiter got clear ofUranus? Or was it the women? “Some of the Operations are like those of thespring in England. This country has no sex-force to draw on,” observed Crowleyon January 5, noting after the operation with Grace Harris, its lack of “thatmutual attraction which makes Energized Enthusiasm possible. . . . Women inAmerica seem purely animal. They ‘come like water and like the wind they go.’Not one of these Operations in this country has had the flavor that one gets allthe time in Europe. I feel inclined to throw the whole thing down and stick toBabalon until I succeed in incarnating Her.”He did a geomancy using random dots to fathom the reason for failure at the IX°and what he might do to improve things. “The answer is roughly this: that I lackfriends and money, and the consequent élan.” Finding wisdom in Matthew 3:12, “Tohim that hath it shall be given,” he saw the depth of his material problem.“Well I admit I’m tired of going about New York with less than a pound in mypocket—usually less than a dollar!—and when my money comes I’ve no doubt the IX°will be better. So far, though I have written ‘success,’ I have not had thatindubitable and striking success that I call worthy of this Royal SacerdotalArt.”Nor was he likely to get much more pecuniary encouragement from John Quinn, whowrote an emphatic letter to Crowley on January 5.Dear Mr Crowley:Mr Watson has told me of your call this afternoon.Please don’t be under any misapprehension as to my buying books off you. Ihaven’t agreed to buy any books off you. You voluntarily agreed to bring somebooks over to show me vellum copies, etc. But I haven’t agreed to buy any. Theseare not times when people are spending much money on books. I might care to buyone or two, but at present I don’t care to buy any and I have no presentintention of buying any. If I buy one or two manuscripts, for which I havealready paid you in advance $500; that is all I can spare now. I haven’t anymoney to spare for extra copies of books. I never promised to buy any books offyou. You said you had some vellum books and that you were going to bring themover for the purpose of cataloguing and possibly of sale. I presume you meantsale to whom it might concern. But certainly I didn’t agree to buy all the booksyou were bringing over or any part of them or any one of them. The same thingapplies to the manuscripts. If times were different, I might feel differently.But I want you clearly to understand that you mustn’t look to me for anyconsiderable quantity of money in addition to the $500 that I have alreadyadvanced you on account of the manuscripts. It is well to have things definitelyput down, and Mr. Watson’s statement to me of what you said to him thisafternoon is the first intimation that I had that you were counting upon anyfurther money from me, which you must not do.Yours very truly,John Quinn3 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt197]Cut to the quick, Crowley replied by return of post—twice—denying any thoughtQuinn may have had that he, Crowley, was trying to take advantage of him, or wasguilty of any low or mean act in Quinn’s regard, and please, could Quinn takeback any ill thought of him.Quinn replied to Crowley on January 8 with a seven-page letter, of which thefollowing extracts tell us most as to Quinn’s perception of events.I can dismiss your first letter of the 6th by stating that the four phrases init “trying to take advantage of you,” “any low or mean act,” “and explainyourself,” and “take back any ill thought I may have had of you” have noreference to my feeling or to the facts of the case. Evidently there was amisunderstanding. I neither said nor did anything to indicate that you were“trying to take advantage of me” or that you had “stooped to any low or meanact.” Nor did I say anything that would require you “to explain yourself.” Norhave I any “ill thought of you.”So much for your first letter of the 6th.I received last night your second letter of the 6th.My recollection is that neither the matter of manuscripts nor of de luxeeditions was mentioned during the time of your breakfast with me, but that afterbreakfast in the sidewalk in front of my apartment as I was turning to the rightto go to the Subway and as you were going to walk downtown the subject ofmanuscripts chanced to come up, and that I told you I might be interested in oneor two of your manuscripts. You said that you thought of sending for them. Atthe same time you said that you had a lot of vellum copies of some or all ofyour works and that you thought you “might send for the whole lot”; that youintended to have a bibliography made of them here, and that there was not muchchance of disposing of them on the other side. You also said you had aconsiderable stock of books in which you had a large sum of money invested. Isaid that I hoped you might be able to make some arrangement with some publisherhere to deal with them and that I might be interested in looking at some of thevellum copies and that I might possibly be interested in buying a few of them.I never said that I would “take them all.”The fact that I have paid £1,200 for a picture has nothing to do with myoffering to take a lot of vellum copies en bloc. . . . I never in my life haveever bought anything “offhand,” as you say, or without asking the price orcondition. [Quinn gives his conditions when assessing possiblepurchases] . . . If you said “You know it is a large matter—over two hundreditems,” of which I have no recollection, it was a purely voluntary thing on yourpart with reference to bringing over your books. . . . Then you volunteered,without being asked by me, “to bring over all your books.” [Quinn thought ACwould get them to a dealer.] For at your suggestion I had sent the Rodin and thethree other books to Mr. Birnbaum with a view of his trying to get a purchaserfor them. And when they were returned to me the other day by Mr. Birnbaum, hesaid that he had tried to get purchasers for them and had failed.According to your letter, the books were discussed first “and then you mentionedthe MSS.” My recollection is quite the other way . . .The $500 advance was solely with reference to the manuscripts and had nothing todo with the books. The night you remained after the dinner, when my otherfriends had left, you discussed only the manuscripts. You did not say then, whatyou now write, that you “stayed in New York solely on account of thistransaction.” I cannot see under what possible theory you could have stayed inNew York on account of the transaction [my italics]. When I agreed to advanceyou the $500 on account of the manuscripts I told you that “money was moneythese times” and that I was limiting my purchases very strictly these days. Youhad taken your apartment previously to that evening, and told me that one of thereasons why you wanted $500 was to pay your rent at the hotel [the Wolcott], soyou could leave there. Besides, you had told me previously to that you hadengaged a secretary.It is perfectly true that I gave you the name of a bank. But I did not“introduce you to a bank.” I told you of the Harriman Bank and said that withour banks it was customary to ask for a minimum average deposit before the bankwould bother with the account. You said that you wanted to check all of the $500out but that you expected some more money soon. You never said that you expectedthat money from me. I suggested that you explain to the Bank that while you weredrawing the whole initial deposit out, you would ultimately keep a fair averagebalance. But I never said I would be responsible for that balance or that moneyfrom me would make up the balance, or anything remotely resembling that. . . .It is perfectly true that you called up Mr. Watson in regard to the books, butthat was because you told me you did not know the customs regulations. Surely amatter of courtesy on the part of Mr. Watson and myself in advising you on thissubject is no reason why I should be committed to you on a purchase that I neveragreed to make. . . .As I think I have told you several times, I am an exceedingly busy man, and ifthe tone of my letters was either irritating or lacking in amenities, it was notintended. But I did and do want to make my position perfectly clear.You do not “owe me $528.” That money I advanced to you on account of thepurchase of two or three manuscripts. . . .I have said nothing in my letters derogatory to your “reputation.” . . . [Quinnadds that he might still be interested in a book or two, depending on price.]Thanks for sending me the missing Birthday card of 1903. I don’t know whetherits price was included in the purchase price of the original collection or not.If it wasn’t, I shall be very glad to compensate you. . . . There are some ofyour things vellum copies of which I can imagine I should like to have; othersthat I should not care for at all.Yours very truly,John Quinn4 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt198]The day Quinn wrote the above letter, the sun did shine, briefly, on Crowley’sdeclining fortunes. According to his “Colloquy with Thoth,” January 8, 1915,brought him “luck”: “S.K. bought books to $100, and actually paid for them!” Aswish address and phone number—170 West 72nd Street; telephone Columbus4572—accompanied S.K.’s timely purchase. 170 West 72nd Street was the address ofthe “Piccadilly Tea Rooms,” which specialized in British food and was perhaps ameeting place for “S.K.” The telephone number, however, does not match thedirectory address. It may have referred to an apartment above the restaurant, ora payphone.West 72nd Street began its residential existence with the famous Dakota Buildingon Central Park West, which when Crowley had first seen it in 1900, loomedalmost alone above the park. Around 1915 to 1916 fine stone-faced apartmentswere added to existing stock to line the street almost to the Hudson River. Asfor “S. K.”, who paid for $100 worth of Crowley’s books, her identity is still amystery. She may have been a friend of one of Crowley’s more remarkable andfamous lovers, millionairess Aimée Gouraud (also known as Aimée Crocker,1864–1941). Much attracted to Crowley, Aimée called “of her own accord” onJanuary 2 and became increasingly involved with him, though it also appears tohave been a case of renewing past acquaintance.At 3:20 p.m. on January 10, two days after receiving the $100 from S. K.,Crowley and Dutch girl Lea Dewey performed a IX° operation for “sex attraction,”described by the magician as “really quite good, almost up to Europeanstandards,” adding wryly, “This lady [Lea Dewey] has not been long in America.”Results seemed to follow immediately. At 4:00 p.m. an uplifted Crowley “wentround to see Aimée Gouraud and was spontaneously fondled and kissed as I neversaw! Really, a miracle of the first order. S. K., too, practically yielded tome; got quite excited, but being drunk was obsessed by her crazy love affairs.”Clearly S. K. was not Aimée, but she was with Aimée, perhaps at the McAlpinHotel where Aimée shared rooms with husband Alexandre Miskinoff (almostcertainly absent!)—or perhaps at S. K.’s address, or that of a mutual friend(170 West 72nd Street?).It’s possible that S. K. was friendly with Aimée’s daughter “Alma Ashe,” fromAimée’s first marriage to Porter Ashe. Alma, also known as Gladys “Alma” CrockerAshe, or Alma Gouraud (1884–1947), had, on divorcing husband Powers Gouraud(brother of Aimée’s late husband Jackson Gouraud), become her mother’s constantcompanion. Traveling together through Europe and America like sisters, they werein fact sisters-in-law! S. K’s “crazy love affairs,” as Crowley refers to them,seem not dissimilar to those of Alma and her mother, who followed their fancies,as this magazine report color-fully illustrates from the Wasp, San Francisco,Saturday, March 26, 1910:image [images/9781620556313_035.jpg]Fig. 14.1. A typical dance party given by Aimée Crocker (standing center, backrow)WILL THEY SETTLE DOWN HERE?The news that Mrs. Amy Crocker Ashe Gillig Gouraud and her daughter, Mrs. GladysGouraud, are to come West and probably make their home in San Francisco, hascaused a ripple of satisfaction among Mrs. Gouraud’s acquaintances here. Theattitude of society toward its members who fail to observe the hideboundconventions has altered considerably of late years. Anyone who can banishboredom is sure of a hearty welcome. When Amy Crocker was a girl she mightalways be depended on to give society a shock, though her girlish escapades wereonly due to an exuberance of spirits, perhaps. She will find her first husband,with whom she made a romantic elopement, the happy husband of another, and avery staid, quiet lawyer, who goes in for country and golf life. Her secondhusband died some months ago, and the third one quite recently. Considerablecuriosity is being manifested about the daughter, for Gladys Crocker Gouraud—asAlma Ashe—was recalled as one of the most independent little girls that everlived. On one occasion, her grandmother, Mrs. E. B. Crocker, gave the child abirthday party. The little girl requested that she might send out all theinvitations herself. When she showed her grandmother the list of guests, it didnot contain the name of a single girl.I think we can see that far from the picture of a low-life Crowley scraping awayin the shadows of New York presented by somewhat partisan admirers of W. B. andJohn Butler Yeats, the real Aleister Crowley, while in need of funds, was inearly 1915 excellently placed in high echelons of New York society. Indeed, hadhe not decided to do his “duty,” as he saw it, for his country and put himselfin the appalling position of having to appear as a pro-German to get insideGerman propaganda, he could have enjoyed an excellent time all around, despitethe European war, hobnobbing with the rich and famous, delighting all andsundry, penning witty puffs for Vanity Fair. He knew that New York journalism,publishing, and high society were predominantly pro-Allied. And if he were asvenal as his enemies have always suggested, and continue to suggest, he couldhave sold his occult knowledge for money and, like Evangeline Adams, made a goodliving in an uptown apartment giving occult advice and mystical training of thekind enjoyed by Theosophists to this day.That he did not do so should give us pause. He wrote after the war that he didnot want to be a hero, nor set out to become one, nor felt heroic about what hewould do. In this he succeeded beyond measure, for everything he did was to beturned against him. Crowley said that he simply saw a wide-open opportunity forwhich he was uniquely fitted and went for it, rightly giving himself credit thatwhen he realized what an atrocious position he had made for himself, evenstupidly made for himself, he at least bit the bullet and kept it up, despitepainful, pride-numbing, and excruciating emotional and physical consequences. Itis hardly surprising that the only way he found of dealing with thecircumstances that enveloped him was to interpret everything as a “dealing ofGod with his soul” as an adept he had at sundry times vowed to do. Thus, hecould ruminate on what he called the “Curse of the Grade of Magus,” whosehallowed destiny he was approaching; that is, that the Word of the Magus wouldbe taken for a lie and all that he did would be twisted by the profane.INTO THE DARK LAIRAs will become apparent, Crowley’s greatest problem with the German PropagandaKabinett and its overlords, military attaché Franz von Papen, naval attaché KarlBoy-Ed, and ambassador Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff, was to try to convincethem that, against all appearances, he really was pro-German. Though he claimedto be “Irish” and a natural enemy of England, he had a clear English accent,wore Savile Row suits, and had written to the Observer that Germany would payheavily for her crimes against the ruined churches of Belgium and France. Evenmore damning perhaps, in November 1914 the English Review published his “Appealto the American Republic,” referring to the “traitor Prussian” and the hope thatEngland and America would unite against common foes of mankind. He had a lot ofexplaining to do.Crowley’s advantage was that he could “play up” to the psychology of his prey,which he understood intuitively, and this uncanny gift was helped by the factthat Viereck, from the point of view of what he required, knew “a good thing”when he saw one. An English writer, with a reputation (any reputation), preparedto admit in print that the German point of view had fairness going for it andwas a coup really too attractive to pass on, given the pressure of the times.This was the main drive of the German propaganda: to persuade the Americanreader, and German American reader particularly, that Americans should, aboveall, be “fair” to Germany. What better way to do this than to use a “sporting”Englishman willing to see the other chap’s point of view in the interests ofkeeping a just peace and a fair game?Thus, three days after Crowley’s stimulating Sunday afternoon with Aimée Gouraudand S. K., German propaganda weekly the Fatherland appeared in New York newskiosks, price five cents, with Crowley’s “Honesty Is the Best Policy” on page11.5 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt199] On the inside front page readers wouldfirst see an advertisement for “The Fair Play Library,” including poems by Dr.Hanns Heinz Ewers; “German Warsongs”—Deutsche Kriegslieder; and “Searchlights onthe War” by Dr. Bernhard Dernburg. Editors’ names were given as George SylvesterViereck and Frederick F. Schrader.The Fatherland’s reasonable pieces were contrasted on page 4 with the headlineAllied Press Hysterical. Crowley recognized the truth of this. How could heundermine the Germans’ successful approach of appearing reasonable,unhysterical? The answer became obvious to him rather quickly. The upper left ofpage 14 advertised “A Hand-Colored Picture of EMPEROR WILHELM from CELEBRITY ARTCO. BOSTON MASS.” Such a sleazy attempt at a sacred relic may well have inspiredCrowley’s bizarre article about the Kaiser as the “New Parsifal,” “Saviour ofthe World,” a more than Christ-like, messianic figure literally “dwarfing”“obscene” King George V, and assumed to heavenly, mystical proportions andrealms, which was published later in the year by Paul Carus of Chicago’spro-German Open Court magazine, a magazine dedicated to “The Science of Religionand the Religion of Science.”6 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt200]In retrospect, Crowley reckoned that he must have been drunk both when he wrote“The New Parsifal” and when he sent it to Carus (1852–1919), author of TheGospel of Buddha (1894). “I suppose I had become acclimatized to the idea thatall serious and eminent people are perfectly brainless. He swallowed it, hook,line, and sinker,” recalled Crowley in his Confessions. Nonetheless, “The NewParsifal” appeared comfort-ably in the August issue of Open Court between alearned article about King Darius of Persia and the editor’s “English Diplomacyand the Fate of the ‘Huns,’” which opens with the statement that the initialcause of the war was the question of “whether the Slav or the Teuton” would be“the leader in Europe.”image [images/9781620556313_036.jpg]Fig. 14.2. Paul Carus (1852–1919)Crowley might have got a kick from seeing absurd propaganda printed instead ofclever stuff, but it is likely that many readers accepted his garbage at facevalue. However, no one had yet seen anything like “The New Parsifal” in Januarywhen Crowley’s first, cautious Fatherland article appeared on the 13th.Page 16 of that issue adhered to the sweet reason approach: a “DEBATE” betweeneditor Viereck and English visitor Cecil Chesterton*87[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft87] at New York’s Cort Theater on January 17—“Whetherthe Cause of Germany or of the Allied Powers is Just.”Coming to Crowley’s own submission (no pun intended), the Fatherland editorinserted at its head an interesting byline. It corrects the perception Crowleyadvanced in the Confessions of a straight-off, disinformative reductio adabsurdum counter-propaganda campaign of ludicrously broad, unreasonablearticles, to be taken by Americans as so extreme as to damn any cause advocated.This is how Viereck actually introduced Aleister Crowley:The Allies have been jubilant over the frankness of Maximilian Harden. It is atleast matched by the frankness of Mr. Aleister Crowley, the pro-British poet[note]. In fact, this is so well realized in England that the present article iscirculated secretly in manuscript and every precaution is taken to prevent itsviews from becoming known to the “common people.” Let us add that the editors of“The Fatherland” do not agree with the author’s final conclusion and that thearticle is published solely as a significant expression of British opinion. Innext week’s issue Mr. Crowley will conclude his brilliant exposure of Britishhypocrisy.Crowley’s article seems a fairly honest piece on British hypocrisy—andespecially hysteria—in British propaganda, encapsulating what he had criticizedwith Austin Harrison and Raymond Radclyffe in London where both popular andserious press ranted “à la fishwife,” inflating Germans into formidablemonsters, inciting attacks on all things seemingly German, instead ofconcentrating on sober, determined measures necessary to ensure victory.Crowley’s article was rational, consistent with his established views as regardsthe pitfalls of national arrogance, and appearing sensible, conformed to Germanstrategy. Presenting himself as the “original Sinn Feiner” to an editor whoclaimed great sympathy with Irish independence, Crowley showed himself useful;he was let in, just. With few cards, he played them with care, one step at atime.The second installment of “Honesty is the Best Policy” appeared on January 20,with the editor’s spin on page 5. “The following paper concludes Mr. Crowley’sanalysis of British sham and folly.” Crowley’s conclusion did not please theeditors. While finding the article useful propaganda, they distanced themselvesfrom it. It apparently gave too much away, making the Kaiser resemble not somuch a man under pressure as a man who reacted to pressure, even a man overcomeby it. This was not the “New Parsifal.”Before Austria has moved a man or a gun, Russia mobilizes. And what was theposition of the German Emperor? His bankers had told him that Germany could nolonger endure the weight of her armour; the incident of Zabern*88[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft88] had shown the Junkers that they could still notcontrol the Social Democrats, but that another year or two would see the end oftheir power. He must strike now or never.He looked about him. The weakness of the British Government and its supposedpreoccupant with the Ulster folly and the suffragettes encouraged him to hope.He saw France, mere rottenness, its bandages torn off by the pistol-shot ofMadame Cailleaux.†89 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft89] All things conspired; hewould make one final effort for peace by threatening Russia.And then he suddenly knew it was no good. Nothing was any good; nothing wouldever be good again. Sir Edward Grey [British Foreign Secretary] spoke for peace,spoke of neutrality, in the House of Commons at a moment when thousands ofBritish troops were already in Belgian waters, and the fleet, concentrated andready for action, already held the North Sea.. . . Even a worm will turn; even a Quaker will fight if he is cornered.Wilhelm struck.Just after midnight, the day before the Fatherland appeared, an uncomfortablyhot Crowley, with window open, dressed only in a silk dressing gown, recordedOpus XXVI. Weather moist “but warm as June,” the temple had been pitch dark. TheObject: “Money.” The Lord was invoked by the “adoration” from Crowley’s sacredplay The Ship, published in Equinox X in 1913.Thou, who art I, beyond all I am,Who hast no nature and no name,Who art, when all but thou are gone,Thou, centre and secret of the Sun,Thou, hidden spring of all things knownAnd unknown, Thou aloof, alone,Thou, the true fire within the reedBrooding and breeding, source and seedOf life, love, liberty, and light,Thou beyond speech and beyond sight,Thee I invoke, my faint fresh fireKindling as mine intents aspire.Thee I invoke, abiding one,Thee, centre and secret of the Sun,And that most holy mysteryOf which the vehicle am I!Appear, most awful and most mild,As it is lawful, to thy child!The “child” in this case was Crowley’s will fixed in the volatile, born of hisautoerotic passion, with a “portion” of the ensuing Elixir offered to thetalisman of Hermes. Results there were. After February 2, Crowley recorded anincoming flow of funds. “This time $1.25; 24 Jan $8; 25 Jan $62.50 [from C. S.Jones and the O.T.O. Vancouver Lodge]; 2 Feb $25 for climbing article”—Crowley’sfirst commission from Vanity Fair.While Crowley had been working up his first Fatherland articles, John Quinn hadwritten to William Butler Yeats on January 13, informing him of Crowley’spresence in New York. The letter would precipitate consider-able upset onYeats’s part, which Quinn had to do much to assuage before the end of April1915.My dear Yeats:. . . Aleister Crowley is here. He seems desperately hard up. One hears allsorts of stories about him but aside from a strong appetite for strong drinkI’ve seen nothing wrong about him. His brand of the occult doesn’t interest mein the least.7 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt201]A look at appendix 2, listing the full scale of John Quinn’s acquisitions ofCrowley’s work, might make one question whether Quinn did find any interest inCrowley’s literary and magical writings, and why he was so keen to calm Yeats’sconcerns about having anything to do with him. As we shall see, Quinn threetimes uses the same stock expressions to William Butler Yeats to distancehimself—or to appear to have distanced himself—from Crowley.GETTING IN WITH THE GERMANSWhile we may suspect Crowley’s account of meeting a certain “O’Brien” on top ofa “stage,” or bus, heading up 5th Avenue, “I think early in 1915,” who got offat 37th Street having left a card and an invitation to his office, otherelements of Crowley’s Fatherland story may be assessed as based in fact.Turning up at the Fatherland’s office on Broadway—“O’Brien” was never to be seenagain—Crowley says that he met Joseph Bernard Rethy (1894– 1941), Jewish authorof The Song of the Scarlet Host, and Other Poems.8[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt202] Scathing of Rethy’s being a “shining light” ofNew York’s Poetry Society, considered by Crowley a distinction any fool whocould tie a dozen words together might claim, Rethy introduced the mage toViereck.9 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt203] Viereck would boast of being grandsonof Germany’s first emperor by actress Adele Viereck.Crowley then met Viereck’s friend Alexander Harvey (1868–1949), Belgian-bornwriter of The Forbidden Floor, a ghost story in The Toe—and Other Tales (1913).Harvey professed admiration for Crowley’s work. Crowley could not reciprocateuntil he’d read Harvey’s Shelley’s Elopement and William Dean Howells: A Studyof the Achievement of a Literary Artist. Harvey, in his turn, introduced Crowleyto Edwin Markham (1852–1940). Despite Markham’s fellowship of the Poetry Societyof America, Crowley praised his The Man with the Hoe, and other poems (1898) as“assuredly first-rate of its kind.” It dealt with the hardships of labor, andproving popular, led to Markham’s lecturing to labor groups in New York.Markham’s 1902 publication Lincoln and Other Poems was read at the dedication ofthe Lincoln Memorial. Crowley’s first encounter with Viereck and his team couldhave occurred practically any day between early November 1914 and mid-January1915.Crowley could not have proceeded with the vacant opportunity to subvert Germanpropaganda and spy on its perpetrators had he not been very clear in his ownmind about his fundamental loyalty to England. His loyalty had two aspects.The first, he asserted on numerous occasions, was a simple, boyish enthusiasm tojoin in with “Rule Britannia!” of the “my country, right or wrong” instinctiveor emotional kind of collective patriotism. The second aspect he tried to definein his Confessions.I hasten to explain that by loyalty I mean neither admiration, approval, oranything amiable of any kind. I reserve the right to speak as severely asMilton, Wordsworth, Byron, Shelley, and Swinburne. All this does not touch thepoint. I am English, and that in a very special sense, as being the prophet andpoet appointed by the gods to serve her. We do not accuse Isaiah of beingunpatriotic because he thunders against Israel. Isaiah’s motive is mine. . . . Ifeel myself to be an integral element of this England; what I do I do for hersake. I may have to scrub her face with yellow soap, open an abscess, orextirpate a cancer. Working as I do in a world of spiritual causes altogetherbeyond the comprehension of common people I am liable to be misunderstood.10[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt204]Crowley perhaps never realized fully just how off-the-planet this might sound tosober realists indifferent to “spiritual causes.” But then, his country ofbirth’s perceived inability to recognize his genius had inured him to the ideathat he would not be understood. As an artist he had reason for some bitterness,but chose not to nurse it. Having concluded that Harvard professor of physicsand psychology, Hugo Münsterberg (1863–1916), was the real mastermind behind theGerman propaganda campaign, he put his head down and got on with the difficultjob of undermining it.MÜNSTERBERGCrowley had known of Münsterberg for some five years, considering him an “oldenemy”: intellectual or spiritual enemy, that is.We had quarreled about philosophy and physics. His mind was intensely positive,brutally matter-of-fact, but capable of appreciating subtlety, and far more opento new facts and theories than most of his opponents supposed. His arrogancewas, to a great extent, the Freudian protection against his own uncertainty. Heknew psychology, he knew men; he understood business; and in his capacity ofinstructor at Harvard, he had acquired the habit of forming and directing minds.So much I knew, and I pictured my duel with him in romantic terms of SherlockHolmes and Moriarty.11 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt205]Crowley had come to the States armed with an introduction to English expatHereward Carrington (1880–1958),*90 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft90] leadingmember of the American Society for Psychical Research.Dear Carrington,This will introduce you to Aleister Crowley, poet, sage, mountain climber, andgeneral lunatic. I am sure you will have much in common.E. Feilding12 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt206]As secretary of the British Society for Psychical Research, Everard Feilding hadjoined Carrington in investigating Italian medium Eusapia Paladino (1854–1918),famous for controversial “materializations” and vaunted psychic gifts.Concluding investigations in Naples in 1908, Feilding and Carrington foundEusapia innocent of fraud, a position modified later with the acceptance thatsometimes she played tricks.Carrington’s book Eusapia Palladino and Her Phenomena heralded the medium’sarrival in New York on November 10, 1909. During her seven-month stay, séanceswere observed at Columbia University. There, Professor Münsterberg foundtrickery at the house of Professor Lord. For example, Paladino seemed able tomove curtains in a room where all windows and doors were closed. Münsterbergdiscovered that she manipulated a jet of air from a rubber bulb. The exposureswere sensational, but Carrington insisted it was well known that Eusapia wasoccasionally fraudulent. Paladino told journalists that she felt tricks wereexpected, fearing harm from hostile investigators when in genuine trance.Despite Carrington’s warning to investigators against familiar tricks in acircular letter sent in advance, and his reminding Münsterberg of the manyinexplicable phenomena still unaccounted for, Münsterberg, though himself abeliever in life after death, determined to dismiss all “spiritualist”phenom-ena as fraudulent lest nascent interest in parapsychology be establishedas science. Feilding’s friend Crowley considered Münsterberg unnecessarilydoctrinaire, with a one-track mind when convinced that he was right: a traitCrowley would claim he exploited to influence the nature and effectiveness ofthe German propaganda effort."},{"pageContent":"FIFTEENimage [images/9781620556313_099.jpg]Getting HotterCrowley chose to attribute his successful wooing of Lola Augusta Grumbacher,*91[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft91] née Oliviera, on January 26 to the same Opus(XXII) for “sex attraction” with Lea Dewey on the 10th that he considered hadwarmed up Aimée Gouraud and S. K in his regard. Distinguished by a profile likeFlorentine poet Dante’s, and a muscular, masculine frame hailing from northBrazilian state Pará, Lola, wealthy widow of Very Illustrious Sir KnightMauricio Grumbacher 33° (1850–1912),†92 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft92] was,according to Crowley, “astoundingly passionate.” At 9:15 p.m., by the light of agas stove, with the temperature at 0°F, Crowley gave a grateful Lola the IX°treatment. A meeting with a Mrs. Schlessinger in the afternoon had put the ideaof a “rich marriage” in his mind, and this would be the Object of a sex-magickoperation in which “consciousness must have been lost absolutely; only at thelast moment the Will asserted itself in an appropriate scream.” Crowley felt acomplete mental upheaval. “The return of Aleister Crowley. No further comment isneeded.”Most unusually, a second operation followed almost immediately, though“naturally shorter!” “Both were most spontaneous, fervent, ardent, orgiastic,ecstatic; in fact, quite ideal. The screaming was very simultaneous. The Elixirin both cases was plentiful and of admirable quality.” The operation was, herecorded, “quite up to European standards.” His final note is intriguing: “As inthe case of Beatrice Levy in the summer of 1914, Pan was so furiously incarnatedin the girl that actual obsession occurred, the symptoms being those of violentand repeated sickness.”image [images/9781620556313_037.jpg]Fig. 15.1. Song of Summer, 1914 by Beatrice Sophia Levy (1892–1974?)Crowley had of course been in Switzerland the previous summer, and I thereforewonder if the Beatrice Levy he mentions was not American watercolorist BeatriceSophia Levy (1892–1974?). According to auction records, she painted in Franceand Switzerland. Her 1914 landscape (color etching; aquatint) Song of Summer,1914 shows a naked lady in a grove looking up to a bird swooping above. Perhapsthe “bird” was her freed soul, or the agent thereof, and the grove one sacred toPan.Lola, admitting an age of thirty-seven years, joined the Beast again three dayslater: a last encounter, the reasons why lost to history. The desire of theBeast for a rich marriage was doubtless perked up again, however, during thelate afternoon of January 30.Outside it had been “brilliantly fine, cold, exhilarating,” while inside thetemple was darkness, save a little light from the remains of day creepingthrough the blinds. Into the charmed circle came “T[hrice] H[oly] T[hrice]I[lluminated] T[hrice] I[llustrious] Soror Aimée Crocker Gouraud. Initiate ofthe Sanctuary IX° O.T.O.” Crowley had either admitted her to the Order in Londonor Paris, or there had been a lead-up in New York. That he gives fifty-year-oldAimée IX° status means that he had explained the secret of the degree, and shetherefore knew what she might herself achieve. As Aimée had a quite genuinehunger for esoteric knowledge and experience, she may already have acquired theessence of the matter from experiences in the east, which from her own account(And I’ d Do It Again, 1936) were both spiritual and sexual. Neither yogicmeditation nor the word kundalini would have been new to her, and the coupledoubtless compared notes on chakra matters. Crowley noted that he had been“wanting this particular partner since many months,” which does suggest anattraction on his part from before his arrival in New York.The Beast wanted to marry Aimée, but one suspects that Aimée preferred men whodid not have power over her, and she knew Crowley was both very hot stuff andvery deep water. Crowley was respectful, noting the Thrice Holy IlluminatedSoror had “a Will like the Holy Phallos itself!” She “kept concentrated onsex-force,” and Crowley did the same. “Either [object of each] may resulttherefore.”As the operation was unexpected, the Beast did not feel fully prepared. It was“not very orgiastic” as his mind was rather confused. He was untypically afraidof getting things wrong in so important an operation. Still, the soror’sastonishingly prehensile vagina—something he loved to his last days—greatlyimpressed him, and the Elixir had a “rare delicacy of flavor.” Both he and Aiméefelt very well afterward. But nothing came of it, despite an outsider’s thinkingthat perhaps AC and AG were (almost) made for one another. Crowley could hardlybegrudge a soul mate the perfect freedom he valued so highly. He would go onwishing for years, but Aimée stuck to her guns. They remained friends, however,as this letter of October 1, 1923, from Crowley to Aimée illustrates abundantly.Dearest Aimée,Thanks for your letter.. . . By the way, what do you do with your house [in Paris] while you are away?Do you shut it up or keep it going at low pressure? If the latter, and you’dlike to lend it to us [Crowley and Leah Hirsig] while you are away, I canpromise you I’ll fix up something really amusing by the time you return. Pleasecable me if you will.In any case I will write to you in America. I shall probably be somewhere nearParis for the Winter.1 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt207]If sex magick proved useless for a rich wife, he would never stop using it tokeep afloat financially, though he was still unsure as to whether he’d got thetechnique anything like right. As for money, why go to all that work for twentycents when $20,000 might be just as likely, or unlikely? But if it was anywherein the “air,” he hoped to attract it.Late afternoon on February 11 the air was warm, and it felt like spring.Employing Lea Dewey’s professional skills, he set his mind on $20,000. “I made amental image of the room being filled with showers and showers of big ten-dollarpieces and held this very well, even in the midst of the orgasm, which waslengthy; though I could feel her mouth sucking up mine, I could simultaneouslysee the gold filling the room.” He confessed that his sense of taste had beenweakened a little as the pair had been sniffing cocaine before they commenced.Two days later Leila Bathurst Waddell, Grand Secretary General of the BritishO.T.O., of 125 Victoria Street, London, boarded RMS Lusitania at Liverpool,bound for New York. On the ship Leila met an officer called McFall, who hadsaved up the desired sum. He offered to marry Leila and to settle the sum uponher.A few days later, Crowley wondered about Opus IV for “Success,” concluding thateach of the successes since that time had only partly materialized, beforevanishing. Was it the Mercurial character of the invocations? Things were apt tobe slippery, full of tricks and bizarre turns. Then there was the issue oftechnique. “I evidently don’t know how to fix the volatile at all, though thefirst half of the operation is all right.”2 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt208] Healso noticed that when he sniffed cocaine his critical faculty went to pot. Heand prostitute Lea Dewey had developed a temporary habit for the stuff; it mightfill a vacant hour—with vacancy.Any great hopes that his empty moments would be flooded with joys when Leilafinally arrived at the Hotel Wolcott at 4 West 31st Street on Saturday, February20, were soon dashed. After all their years of adventure together acrossBritain, Europe, and Russia, Crowley had that unhappy feeling of finding that apast passion now felt like a stranger; something had gone. Exhausted, they bothhit the sack but roused each other in the dawning frosty light at 6:35 the nextmorning, presumably at Crowley’s place. Opus XXXV with Thrice Holy ThriceIlluminated Thrice Illustrious Soror Leila Waddell IX° O.T.O., Grand SecretaryGeneral for Ireland, Iona, and all the Britains was performed for sexattraction. Did they really need it?A fortnight later Crowley observed that at the first opportunity the magick hadto work, it was effective on a Mrs. O. R. Drey and on one Doris Gomez (“orCarlisle or Edwards”) the same day. Doris would become a regular “assistant.”Leila, it appears, pursued McFall, the officer with the nest egg. Leila andCrowley would join sexual forces again on March 19 with the Object of “AllMcFall’s savings . . . undertaken in unison by both parties.” While matters inthat direction were observed to be going well in early May, with anotherboosting operation with Leila on the 4th of that month for “sex force andattraction,” a note added in January 1916 concluded, “a pure jest of the boyMercury, all this.”While Crowley fretted about money and sex attraction, Quinn was trying not toput his foot in it with John Butler Yeats and his poet son over his relationswith Crowley. One surmises that Willie in Ireland was greatly annoyed that hisfather did not seem to share his abhorrence for Crowley and was incensed thatCrowley was near to his source of patronage (and his father’s effective keeper).As can be seen from the following exchange, Quinn considered William ButlerYeats “confused” over the whole issue. Quinn’s response was to repeat the mantrathat Crowley was not an artistic contender as far as he was concerned, and hewas not interested in gossip about the man.On Wednesday, February 24, Quinn wrote to John Butler Yeats to reassure him thathe hadn’t implicated him where Crowley was concerned. “I have written W.B.Y. aletter of which I enclose you an extract re Crowley. You will see that it can’tpossibly ‘get you in wrong,’ as the saying is. I was going to write to W.B.Y.shortly anyway.” Quinn’s postscript suggests that he’d asked JBY to make someinquiry about Crowley: “Good luck and let me know about the occultist.”3[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt209] Quinn wrote again to John Butler Yeats at 317West 29th Street the next day.I changed the letter to W.B. and took out all reference to you or to the readingof the letter and have referred back to a letter of mine of Jan. 13th to him inwhich I mentioned Crowley [see here [9781620556313_c14.xhtml#p262]]. So you neednot have any fear that he will even know that you showed or read or mentioned tome anything about his letter to you. I am very glad that you told me what W.B.Y.had written, it is so easy to get things confused and he often does get thingsconfused.4 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt210]Quinn sent his letter about Crowley (and Frank Harris) to William Butler Yeatsthe same day (February 25).My dear Yeats,I told Lady Gregory when she first came here, casually, of Crowley’s calling onme. I had a wonderful pencil drawing of him by Augustus John. He wanted to seeit and wanted the right to reproduce it. John had written several times about itand asked me to have it lithographed here and I sent copies to John and sentsome copies to Crowley.He seemed desperately hard up and I believe still is hard up. He invited meseveral times to dine with him, but every invitation I declined, and have neverdined with him at any hotel or at his apartment. I mentioned the fact that hewas here to Miss Coates, who was here a month or so in the autumn on her wayfrom the Adirondack Mountains to the South. Finally, I asked her and your fatherto meet me at dinner and invited Crowley. He did not talk badly, but he is notan interesting talker. Your father and Miss Coates did most of the questioning.Frankly, his “magic” and astrology bored me beyond words. Whatever he may be, hehas no personality. I am not interested in his morals or lack of morals. He mayor may not be a good or profound or crooked student or practitioner of magic. Tome he is only a third or fourth rate poet.In my letter of Jan. 13th to you I said that “he seems hard up.” One hears allsorts of stories about him, but, aside from an appetite for strong drink, I haveseen nothing wrong about him. His brand of the occult does not interest me inthe least. I have never dined or lunched with him, and have no interest orcuriosity as to what he is or is not doing and have not taken up with him in anyway. He is not my kind of a person.5 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt211]Quinn’s attempt at self-justification seems curiously defensive andover-assertive at the same time. On March 21, Willie again wrote about Crowleyto Quinn from Stephen’s Green Club, Dublin. Yeats’s preamble to calumniatingCrowley is interesting in itself as it shows how close the worlds of Crowley andW. B. Yeats really were.Yeats says he’s been reading Bram Stoker’s Dracula, which he thinks little of,only having bought it because, but for the war, he’d have otherwise gone toAustria with Everard Feilding of the Psychical Research Society (an importantcontact of Crowley’s) to investigate a haunted castle of Dracula there, whilealso calling on a “young lawyer, known to Feilding” who had been persecuted by“an imp.” Feilding, he says, had himself seen the “vagaries” perpetrated by the“priceless imp” who, with the young lawyer gone to fight in the war (and alreadyperhaps dead), now had no one to haunt. Yeats then regaled Quinn with hisdiscovery of a rare book about alchemical marvels occurring in Dublin around1790. He then comes to his point.I am interested in what you say of Crowley. I knew him 16 or 17 years ago butdropped him on finding that he lived under false names and left variousdistricts without paying his debts. Lord Middlesex was one of his names, anotherwas that of a Russian nobleman. I was also in a case against him. He dropped thecase rather than go into the witness box. He is I think mad, but has writtenabout six lines, amid much foul rhetoric, of real poetry. I asked about him atCambridge, and a man described him being dragged out of the dining hall by aporter, thrown out, struggling, because of the indecency of his conversation. Heis an English and French type. You I think have nothing like him. He used to bea handsome fellow.6 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt212]Yeats proceeds to lay into Frank Harris, with similar invective. “He [Harris] isprobably as uneasy and as restless as Crowley is mad, and so without judgement—atragic figure. I was told the other day in London that the authorities wouldarrest both men on their return, but that may be no more true than the other warrumours.”7 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt213] One hopes lawyer Quinn saw throughthe mire of uncritical hearsay and prejudice evinced in this letter from one heso admired. Yeats clearly wanted Quinn to have nothing whatever to do withCrowley for his own good, and Yeats was hardly mollified by Quinn’s reply ofApril 24 on the same subject.A word about Crowley in answer to your letter: He is a perfect misfit here ofcourse. His writings have no popular appeal. One hears awful things about himbut beyond a big capacity for strong drink I have seen nothing crooked abouthim. But I have not seen him since the beginning of January and I only saw himtwo or three times all told. He is apparently “up against” financialdifficulties as they say here.8 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt214]It is just as well that Crowley knew nothing of this passage of letters, or hemight have been on to Quinn about another case of slander, this time coming fromIreland. But he had enough on his hands with financial worries. Crowley triedagain with Lea Dewey on Thursday after-noon, March 4, to effect relief from allNew York debts. He didn’t get the money, but obtained some relief from worry,while his thoughts on technique began to crystallize. “I think the mentalfeeling at the moment of orgasm must be a Samadhi*93[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft93] between the Object and the Orgasm. As long as thetwo are separate, the Prana [current of vitality] which acts as an incarnatingEgo on the ‘Child’ is not duly formulated.”After Opus XXXVII with Doris Gomez to fathom “the further mysteries of the IX°”during late afternoon March 19, neatly expressed in Latin—and here translated,“In the hands of the mistress while I was licking her cunt”—Crowley confessed tobeing still “puzzled as to ‘Coagula,’ the fixing of the volatile created by theOperation.” He was sure the ancient alchemical formula “Solve et Coagula”(dissolve and coagulate) was the key to the Royal Art, but his interpretation ofit felt inadequate.PHILADELPHIA: CITY OF BROTHERLY LOVEDespite impressing those who witnessed invocations of Hermes at his makeshifttemple (we don’t know if he acquired a full team of eight participants),9[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt215] the long series of thrice-daily invocationsceased with Crowley’s departure for Philadelphia after March 10. In hisConfessions he said that his week’s trip there was to see for himself the“great” evangelist Billy Sunday (1862–1935). Stories abounded of the wonderswrought by Billy’s Bible-literalist rhetoric, and Crowley wished to see forhimself what all the fuss was about. In January, for example, a reported fiftythousand had stormed Billy’s Philadelphia “tabernacle,” causing a riot of injuryand dam-age when the crowd realized there was no room for them inside.According to Gerald Yorke, Crowley’s essay “Billy Sunday” appeared in Viereck’smore up-market magazine the International in October.Crowley found the “common Bible-banger of the first class” in a woodentabernacle; 15,000 were on their way out, and 15,000 more had amassed to go in.Crowley left the crowd, had lunch, then came back when the queue had gone. Hethen observed the star in full flight on the subject of Naaman the leper. Havingexperienced many “revivals” in his child-hood, he noted how “it is not thepreacher, but the crowd that makes the hysteria.” He’d seen his own father,preacher Edward Crowley, get more “conversions” with less effort and not a wordin the papers.“Billy Sunday is three parts yellow journal fake,” Crowley concluded, puttingSunday’s success to the fact that you couldn’t get a drink in Philadelphiabetween Saturday and Monday, and (Billy) Sunday, who supported prohibition, wasthe only excitement in town, other than to get drunk privately. And Sunday’smagic? Billy moved like the baseball player he was—acting out his words withphysical movements—and told jokes in the manner of the taproom to salt up theusual message. Women were instructed to draw their knees together. “The gates ofhell are closed,” intoned Billy, getting a laugh, and more cash for the cause,whatever it was.John D. Rockefeller recognized that Billy could reach the masses like noordinary established pastor and so make America righteous, sober-dry, andhardworking, the workers’ souls safe in the arms of the Lord, the dollars andcents in the bank. Billy preached to an estimated hundred million people duringhis long career. You would think that sufficient to save the world good andproper.In 1915 in Philadelphia alone, 41,724 “trail hitters” came forward to bepersonally saved by Jesus Christ through the call, and handshake, of media starBilly Sunday.10 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt216] They were called trail hittersbecause they hit the “saw-dust trail.” They had gone forward, swept into thecollective dream. The tabernacles Sunday preached in were strewn with sawdust toabsorb dust and who knows what else and could be swept out after so manysessions, leaving the halls sweet-smelling, for the aroma of men’s and women’sand children’s bodies crammed together must have been something else. It’s oddthat Crowley did not mention that in his article.With the basic realization of failure as regards his extensive Hermesinvocations, one gets a sense of Crowley looking for something to grab hold of,a compass or anchor, especially as the pressure of his voluntary position hithome, as it must have done, daily, with constant references in his sex-magickrecord to failed business ventures, broken promises, and “pole-axing” of plansand expectations. Perhaps he had gone to Philadelphia looking for something deepdown that his father had dispensed in his childhood: the security of absolutesalvation and sealed conviction. Crowley’s paternal family members were mostlyQuakers, and Philadelphia was the “Quaker City,” full of God-fearingmoneymakers. He worked very hard; was he missing something? His great magicalcaducaeus to rule New York had proved a bit of a wet stick, while Billy Sundaypacked them in. Crowley, to give him credit, went to see and to listen. He wasnot convinced; he recognized too clearly the contrived performance, and afundamental insincerity in much of the interest. Crowley knew how easy it was toform a cult with “a gallon of gas” and “to cry a crusade with Deus Vult,” andgive ’em what-they-want, those “empty-headed Athenians.”11[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt217] He knew there was spiritual dynamite hidden awayin teaching attributed to Jesus, but doubted whether Billy had really got to thenub of it. Crowley would give the matter a great deal of high-octane thought thefollowing year, but for the time being, where might the sinner seek his truepath?Judging from the Fatherland’s contents, Crowley wasn’t getting anywhere with hisdesire to undermine its rational approach to propaganda. On March 17,Münsterberg’s article “How Fears and Prejudices Alter People’s Views” arguedwith sweet reason that Allied whipping up of fears regarding alleged evilsperpetrated by Germans was simply a psychological ploy that one could get out ofby recognizing the psychological nature of the appeal to fear. He was sayingthat the views of people hostile to Germany were not truly their own; they hadbeen “got at,” and a bit of German rationalism and solid science could restoresanity. Germans were ahead of the game and doing right in the cause ofcivilization. Crowley stated after the war that he tried to get at Münsterberghimself through the psycho-logical avenue of agreeing with Münsterberg whilepushing him that bit further so that changes of position appeared to Münsterbergas the workings of his own brilliance. Such a turn was not yet in evidence.Crowley decided to focus his own inner life on the getting of “Wisdom.” Inspiredby the Bible’s second book of Chronicles 1:7–13, where Solomon wisely chosewisdom to govern aright and was rewarded in turn by God with all that, femalecompanionship, and riches too, Crowley performed sex magick with Lea Dewey, OpusXLI for “Wisdom.” He doubtless recalled that in the Greek Septuagint version ofHebrew scripture the Hebrew hokmah (wisdom) was translated by the Greek wordsophia (feminine) and interpreted by Jewish philosopher Philo of Alexandria (acontemporary of Jesus) as equivalent to the Stoic logos (the “Word,” masculine),and the Logos-Lord of Crowley’s life was transmittable erotically. Again, theBible pointed the way. The Song of Songs, or Song of Solomon, celebrated thephysical love of the king and his lover as a joyous sacrament of logos andbelieving community. As Blake had shown, the vagina was only the “gate ofhell”—as Billy Sunday would have it—to the filthyminded profane who broughttheir hell with them, unenlightened to the glories of Divine Wisdom, the helpfulwhore of the books of Proverbs and “Wisdom of Solomon.”12[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt218]Crowley had been “bushed” before the operation with Lea, but after an hour andthree quarters of magick, “fatigue fell suddenly on the Alchemist.” He’d beenworking for a full eighteen hours on the astrological treatise for theEvangeline Adams book project, with an unnamed “artificial stimulant” to assistthe good work. He was still at it in August—the treatise, that is.13[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt219] As for the stimulus, it was probably cocaine. Afragment of narrative from the period titled “In Search with Doris Gomez forCocaine in New York” is revealing about little-known aspects of New York at thetime. Where did you purchase cocaine in New York after the 1914 HarrisonNarcotic Act began to be enforced in 1915? Fearless Crowley and streetwise Doriswere on the case.Not slightest idea where to go except general feeling that negroes would be bestchance, and she with a very just apprehension of manhood decided to try first ofall to go outside a negro church at end of service, pick out the mostrespectable looking of the elders and put it straight to him. I am not quitesure whether it spoils the story or not, but the first cast landed a perfectlygood trout.After receiving directions, the dealer transpired to be a lift boy in anapartment block.“There ain’t but 15 floors in this joint”—that meant a dozen decks [of cocaine]would cost $15. Your informant having quoted nine dollars as the price, youwould say you’d made a mistake and wanted the 9th floor. The boy would replythat the gate was out of order but he would land you at the 12th and you couldwalk down, meaning you could have it for 12 dollars.14[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt220]Despite this outing, Crowley’s main quest at the time was for wisdom. It’sunlikely that cocaine helped there, whereas the sexual magick undertaken forwisdom’s blessings proved positive. Crowley found himself more tactful; thingsseemed to be going better. He even wrote a play around this time called TheSavior, on the theme of the folly and false expectations of people expecting amessianic solution through politics or obvious world events. Three years later,the play had trouble passing legal scrutiny as it was considered dangerouslyanalogous to contemporary Washington politics! The legal protest showed “howdire a reign of terror had been established by the megalomaniac in the WhiteHouse and his brutal and thick-headed bravo, Burleson,”*94[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft94] as Crowley described the postmaster general.15[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt221]Crowley’s intuition that he attend to wisdom was intensified after a joyouscunnilingual opus on March 31 initiated a month of regular operations with DorisGomez. “I am getting very strongly the feeling that Solomon was right magicallyas well as merely tactful; that one ought to concentrate on the grade, and lethealth, wealth, and happiness follow if they will.”16[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt222] The grade was that of Magus: he with the “Word”to initiate a new aeon in spiritual consciousness.That same day, the Fatherland’s cover story announced Revolution in India,alleging the jewel in the British Empire’s crown was set to explode in revolt.It was German policy to assist activists in this regard, as it was to stirrebels against Britain in Ireland or elsewhere. And “else-where” includedAmerica.On April 3, blond-haired, blue-eyed German agent Captain Franz Rintelen vonKleist arrived in New York as Swiss-born “Emil Victor Gasche.” As such you canfind him in Ellis Island Passenger Records to this day. The entry states thatGasche came from Berlin via Bergen, Norway, where he boarded the Kristianiafjordon March 25, giving his occupation as “merchant” and his destination New York’sWaldorf-Astoria. Dispatched by Abteilung IIIb (German military intelligence)Gasche took money from Dr. Heinrich Albert’s treasury.17[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt223] Albert’s accounts included a dummy armamentsfirm, as well as the Fatherland. The armaments firm would be revealed in NewYork’s Evening World exposure of Albert in August. Von Kleist employed frontorganization “Labor’s National Peace Council” to recruit radicals to instigatestrikes and to force an arms embargo, activities that underline Germany’s bigpropaganda task was to do everything possible to keep the United States strictlyneutral. As we shall see, Gasche’s fuse was short.image [images/9781620556313_038.jpg]Fig. 15.2. Franz von Rintelen, German spy and saboteurWhile the Fatherland waxed in outrage and indignance at Britain and America,working itself toward a crescendo, Crowley experienced a new inner calm, thanksin part to Doris’s accommodating demeanor. On April 8, having been—for Wisdom’ssake—in “the hand of the mistress, whose cunt I had loved with my mouth” at pastthree in the morning, Crowley observed as a result, “Certainly I have beenacting sensibly (for the first time in my life) ever since.” He had been seatedin siddhasana—that is, the adept’s famous yogic posture—for the three-houroperation. “The orgasm was splendid; the Elixir abundant and full of Prana.” Hewas trying to do things right, coming to see through a series of operations forinspiration and business success (the latter vain) that “where two parties areconcerned, their passion is the most important feature in making the Elixirviable. The mental control merely directs this into the desired channels.”18[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt224]THE LUSITANIAMISLEADING SHIPPING STATISTICS—a headline dominating page 4 of the May 5 editionof Fatherland attempted to highlight “how England tries to cover up her lossesby Submarines.” This would not necessarily go down well with noncommittedreaders as it simply emphasized how much death and destruction German submarinescaused. Crowley may have had a hand in the thinking behind this one. He claimedto have subjected German propagandists to his “reading of American psychology,”which indicated that Americans would be cowed by ruthless strength determinedlyand pitilessly expressed. The Germans concerned apparently respected Crowley’sintellect where the mind’s inner workings were concerned. He had a way withcrisp rationalizations that appeared logical and superior, and which gave hisadvice trajectory and accuracy. The German weakness, Crowley surmised, wasexcessive pride in their intellects. They had to be recht at all times. InCrowley’s postwar, unpublished (at the time) apologia “The Last Straw” heclaimed that he got his point about “American psychology” over to vonBernstorff, Münsterberg, von Papen, Boy-Ed, and other parties to the point ofinfluencing a recommendation to Berlin concerning the validity of an act or actsof unequivocal force to shake Wilson into strict neutrality with publicquiescence. The “hostility” involved in America’s permitting shipping of armsand ammunition to the Allies from American ports was now a principal rapid-firetheme of the Fatherland, whose tone had become noticeably fiercer.Sitting in his office at 17 Battery Place, a short cab ride from the Fatherlandoffices at 1123 Broadway, director of the Booth Steamship Company Mr. PaulCrompton, having decided to return to Great Britain, booked tickets through theBooth Line office for himself; wife, Gladys; four sons; two daughters; andchildren’s governess, twenty-eight-year-old Dorothy Ditman Allen of Frankford,Philadelphia.Departure date: May 1, 1915.image [images/9781620556313_039.jpg]Fig. 15.3. Dorothy Ditman Allen, victim of the Lusitania atrocity (1915 passportphoto)The ship: RMS Lusitania, known affectionately as the “Lucy.”On May 1, shortly after midday, she left her berth at New York harbor’s Pier 54to begin the week’s voyage. You can see the Lusitania’s departure on YouTube.The Crompton family organized their accommodation on D-Deck; Dorothy andeight-month-old Peter Crompton shared first-class bedroom D62.Six days out of New York, passing the Old Head of Kinsale some 12 miles off thesouthern Irish coast, RMS Lusitania was torpedoed and sunk by German submarineU-20. The entire Crompton family perished. The body of young governess DorothyAllen of Philadelphia was never recovered. She was five feet tall, with blueeyes, brown hair, stub nose, and freckles.*95 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft95]This was the largest family loss of the Lusitania atrocity.19[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt225] The lives of 1,198 people were lost. A greatmany of the victims happened to be American citizens.The German embassy was satisfied that it was “covered”; passengers had beenadequately warned. The following notice had been printed (after most people hadpurchased tickets) in fifty U.S. newspapers, including papers in New York.NOTICE!Travellers intending to embark on the Atlantic voyage are reminded that a stateof war exists between Germany and her allies and Great Britain and her allies;that the zone of war includes the waters adjacent to the British Isles; that, inaccordance with formal notice given by the Imperial German Government, vesselsflying the flag of Great Britain, or any of her allies, are liable todestruction in those waters and that travellers sailing in the war zone on theships of Great Britain or her allies do so at their own risk.IMPERIAL GERMAN EMBASSYWashington, D.C., 22 April 1915On May 19, the Fatherland puts in its five cents worth with an editorialconfidently headed WHY THE LUSITANIA WAS SUNK: “Last week we predicted the fatethat has overtaken the Lusitania. The Fatherland did not reach the newsstandstill Saturday, but the editorial in question was written several days beforepublication. . . . Every large passenger ship bound for England is practically aswimming arsenal, carrying vast quantities of ammunition and explosives of everydescription.”The editorial argued that it was ammunition allegedly carried by the ship thatprecipitated greater loss of life. It was the Allies’ fault. “We should indictthe officials of the Cunard Line for murder.” This last line is so hideouslyoutrageous that one is inclined to believe Crowley’s claim that such absurditieswere of his prompting, designed to disgust any sane American reader, to turnthem against Germany with the outraged senses aimed at one thought: Governmentmust do something.Page 9 of the same issue featured a short article, headed THE BRITISH LOBSTER.Anonymous, it has a ring of Crowley’s deliberate madness about it. “Make a cleanjob of it, Johnny Bull. Put King George’s head on the block. Isn’t he one of theHanoverian Germans who have always lorded it over the British race?” The piecepointed out that attacks in England on Germans only demonstrated how manyGermans took leading roles in England. In the wake of the Lusitania’s sinking,the article was, to say the least, extremely childish, and thus conforms toCrowley’s claim of trying where possible to make German propaganda miss its markand rebound on its proponents.While Crowley filled his few spare moments in late May with curious homosexualencounters in a Turkish bath and a magical hand job from Marie Low, a “youngrather pretty negress of the prostitute class”—all for “Wisdom”—the May 26 issueof the Fatherland fulminated in a full-page ad declaring that “German-Americans”were not convinced that the United States was properly neutral, and “they”demanded immediate action.Four days later, in the wee small hours, Crowley (Basileos = Greek for “king”)was voluntarily buggered by a “stranger” (Xenos) called “Finch,” whom Crowleywould become briefly obsessed with. Crowley remarked that as was common to suchoperations, concentration was interfered with “by anxiety,” presumably to dowith the chosen (or merely convenient) locus amandi. Sometimes it is difficultto read such entries with the seriousness with which they seem intended.“Wisdom” was, anyhow, its Object, and Crowley added later that insofar as wisdomwas the path to assuming the grade of Magus, then he was prepared to attribute“the dinner of 10 June” to the act’s magical virtue, for that dinner, he wrotein Rex de Arte Magia, “begins the active part of my Initiation to the Grade ofMagus Aimage [images/dots.jpg]Aimage [images/dots.jpg]” Indeed, the dinner ofJune 10, 1915, would mark a very special encounter.With respect to that occasion, it can have done no harm at all to Crowley’spotential allure that June’s issue of Vanity Fair featured a complimentaryarticle on Crowley by “Arthur Loring Bruce,”*96 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft96]adorned by a specially made copy of Augustus John’s pencil portrait of thesubject (a favor to Crowley from Quinn who owned the original; see below).ALEISTER CROWLEYMystic and Mountain ClimberAll the Britons who are not fighting in the Great War seem to be coming to NewYork this year. One of the most extraordinary of our recent British visitors isAleister Crowley, who is a poet, an explorer, a mountain climber, an “adept” inmysticism and magic, and an esoteric philosopher; in short a person of so manysides and interests that it is no wonder a legend has been built up around hisname. He is a myth. No other man has had so many strange tales told of him.He is an Irishman, and was educated at Malvern and Trinity College, Cambridge,as a preparation for the highly respectable and sedate Diplomatic Service. Butsuch a mission was not to his taste. He soon found that he had no liking for thebeaten tracks in life. So he became an “adept,” a mystic, a wanderer on the faceof the earth.image [images/9781620556313_040.jpg]Fig. 15.4. Vanity Fair, June 1915, drawing of Aleister Crowley by Augustus JohnThe Equinox, his work on occultism is only a part of the gigantic literarystructure which he has built up in the past five years, yet the work containsthe stupendous number of two and a half million words.Mr. Crowley has a habit of disappearing suddenly from Paris, only to bob upagain in Zapotlan, Tali Fu, Askole, Hambantonia, or Ouled Djellal. To him a longjourney is an achievement, a satisfying thing in itself, like the “hiddenknowledge” which he is forever in search of. In 1900 he explored Mexico withoutguides. Two years later he spent three months in India at an altitude of 20,000feet. In 1906, he crossed China on foot. The success of his magic-drama, “TheRites of Eleusis” in 1910 in London, did not tempt him to settle down there forlong as he was next heard of in the heart of the Sahara.As a naked Yogi he has sat for days under the Indian sun, begging his rice. Likeevery true magician he has experimented with hundreds of strange poisons inorder to discover the Elixir of Life and the Elixir of Vision. He has devotedmuch time to the art of materializing divine influences, which he does by theaid of secret incenses; of invocations; and of rituals inherited from theGnostics and Rosicrucians. He once masqueraded through a Cairo season as amysterious Persian prince. He shocked the orthodox by his book “The Sword ofSong”—which was virtually an attack upon everything established—but sooncompelled to forgive him because of the religious fervor of his next volume—abook of devotional hymns. He holds—like all good mystics—that “All thought, orspeech, is false: Truth lies in divine ecstasy beyond them.”He lives in Paris when not on his travels. One of his friends is Augustus John,the painter, one of whose beautiful sketches of Mr. Crowley we are privileged toprint.Another article by Crowley appeared in Vanity Fair in June: BERNARD SHAW ON SELFEFFACEMENT, “by Another Irishman.” Anxious to get in with the Germans, Crowleywas pushing the “Irishman” bit for all it was worth.Now Vanity Fair had nailed a Crowley pennant to its mast; Viereck had no qualmsabout pushing Crowley hard himself. Page 14 of the June 2 Fatherland featured aprominent ad for that month’s issue of the International (billed as “TheBrainiest Magazine in America”).You will be stunned by THE END OF ENGLAND By Aleister Crowley. AUSTIN HARRISON,the editor of the English Review, called Aleister Crowley the greatest poet inEngland. It is the most terrific arraignment of Great Britain ever written. Withpowerful and brilliant strokes Crowley depicts the corruption and hypocrisy ofEngland. He reveals secrets never hitherto told. He holds you breath-less andspellbound by his recital of England’s shame. After you have read this articleyou will have to readjust your opinions.image [images/9781620556313_041.jpg]Fig. 15.5. Helen Westley (1875–1942), actress in costumeAccording to Crowley’s Confessions account it was the invitation of a“journalistic friend” that ended “the oppression and obscurity” of the previousseven months. On June 10 he was introduced at the dinner to two very strikingwomen, who, in their turn, were equally struck by Aleister Crowley. The firstwas prominent poet Jeanne Robert Foster, whose speech, Crowley recalled, “wasstarry with spirituality,” and her looks “beautiful beyond my dearest dream.”The other lady was forty-year-old, Brooklyn-born character actress Helen Westley(1875–1942), seductive doyen of Greenwich Village theater and luminary of playsby George Bernard Shaw, which rather suggests the dinner had something to dowith Vanity Fair.*97 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft97]Crowley had found Babalon in the flesh; she was two, and good to be true."},{"pageContent":"SIXTEENimage [images/9781620556313_099.jpg]Jeanne Did she really break my heart?ALEISTER CROWLEY, MAGICAL DIARY, MAY 31, 1920According to Crowley, the attraction between himself and Jeanne Robert Fosterwas instantaneous. But there was an instantaneous problem. The other lady thehost wished Crowley to meet was equally drawn to the famous magician.A magnetic current was instantly established between the three of us. In the Cat[Jeanne], I saw my ideal incarnate, and even during that first dinner we gaveourselves to each other by that language of limbs whose eloquence escapes thecuriosity of fellow guests.1 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt226]Jeanne had already “clicked” that she had a rival. Reminiscing about HelenWestley’s theatricality, the ever-colorful Beast veered in the direction ofEdgar Allan Poe: Helen, he wrote, “set herself to encompass me with the coils ofher evil intelligence.”The following afternoon Crowley accepted Jeanne’s invitation to take tea withher at the National Arts Club, Gramercy Park, the same place she had taken herclose, older friend John Butler Yeats and where she had listened in an audience,spellbound to her poetic idol, William Butler Yeats.And here lay Crowley’s problem as far as Jeanne was concerned.Like poor William Blake, who, arriving in Felpham, Sussex, in 1800 at patronWilliam Hayley’s suggestion, found himself, unbeknownst to himself, gatecrashinga longstanding “love-in,” or charmed circle, consisting of Hayley, Lady Hesketh,Reverend John Johnson, and the late poet William Cowper, Crowley too hadstumbled upon a tight-knit, high-minded, mutually adoring artistic circle,replete with erotic undercurrents. Matlack Foster, John Butler Yeats, WilliamButler Yeats, Albert Shaw: they all admired, and fancied, Jeanne Foster, withthe latter three tending to operate as if Jeanne’s marriage to Matlack was anunfortunate, albeit not inhibiting, incident. In 1918 a jealous JohnQuinn—already patron to the Yeatses—would join the maypole. What is even moreremarkable per-haps is that the circle around Jeanne—poet, brain, high-mindedbeauty—would carry on after all the protagonists were dead. Witness these linesfrom relatively recent biographies.Trying to account for his subject and friend Jeanne’s attraction to Crowley,Richard Londraville wrote how “her marriage to the elderly Matlack Foster,always problematic, did not satisfy her yearning for a more traditional role asmuse and helpmate to a powerful intellect.”2 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt227]Crowley was the “latest flavor to sophisticated New Yorkers.”3[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt228] Markedly partisan, William M. Murphy related howJeanne’s “dear and devoted friend” John Butler Yeats was to “watch in horrifiedfascination as his son’s old enemy proceeded to captivate the sensitive andvulnerable ‘loveliest of women ever.’”4 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt229] “For atime he [Crowley] succeeded in duping Jeanne Foster, who was betrayed by hisugly good looks, his charisma, his position as leader of a magical cult, and hisreputation as poet.”5 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt230]Jeanne, in her late eighties when consenting to spoken, not recorded, interviewswith Londraville, appears to have been guarded and “general” about therelationship. It is difficult to tell if it was from her that Londravilleobtained the idea that Crowley “was in need of her professional talents”—as aghostwriter! If the story came from Jeanne, it may have been a simple way ofexplaining one reason why they would part company; that is, that Crowley’s ideaof her role was beneath her talents. If so, she, or Londraville, was confused bycross currents. Crowley certainly had no need for a professional writer! He wasthe ghostwriter, preoccupied at the time with writing a major astrology tome forEvangeline Adams. Perhaps he asked Jeanne, in her capacity as literaryjournalist, if she could help with editing (something he loathed to do) or takesome dictation at some point. This might have jarred, though hardly if Jeannereally did seek, as Londraville asserts, the “traditional” role of “muse andhelpmate to a powerful intellect.” Enough speculation! There has been too muchsupposition by biographers already.Londraville suggests that Crowley asked Jeanne to give up her work on the Reviewof Reviews to work for him. Because this work brought her an income, and Crowleya useful connection, it seems unlikely to have been the case, at least at thetime, and was perhaps something Jeanne chose to say more than fifty years later.She had herself offered her resignation to Shaw six months earlier. Crowley andJeanne probably quarreled about how much time she would spend away from him.Jeanne’s memory was quite understandably imperfect in recording details ofevents that had taken place more than fifty years earlier. In a letter to herbiographer Richard Londraville, dated January 13, 1968, for example, Jeanne hasW. B. Yeats as a member of the “A.A.”: “When you [Londraville] come next summeryou must look at the document I have—Yeats’ correction of certain thingspertaining to the occult Society the ‘A.A.’ (London Society) of which he was amember.”6 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt231] The “Aimage [images/dots.jpg]Aimage[images/dots.jpg]” was Crowley’s magical Order, the successor, as he saw it, tothe Golden Dawn of Yeats and his friends; Yeats was not a member. Jeanne’smemory might have been imperfect, but she had lost none of her remarkablesensitivity and mysticism. Letters to Londraville reveal that she was convincedthat her knowing him had revived in her mind “the appearance to me of certainthings of that far past. I have been confronted with a glimpse of my ‘Mask.’”7[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt232] The “Mask,” from her description of it in thesame letter to Richard Londraville, appears to be theosophically reminiscent ofwhat Crowley called the “Holy Guardian Angel.” According to Jeanne RobertFoster, writing in 1968, “In Theosophy the Mask is the ‘causal body’—the body orself that contains all that a man has been from the beginning of a primordialself. Occultists and men of vision have observed that when a man—necessarily hemust have genius—confronts even a semblance or a vision of the Self, his workchanges or he creates a double self.”8 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt233] Jeannehad experienced visions of Londraville “heavily swathed in black robes”officiating in an ancient rite “always as long ago,” but usually appearingaround 2 p.m. Jeanne informed Londraville that he was beginning to confront his“Mask.”In a moving letter of November 15, 1968, the elderly Jeanne described the firstappearance in her house of W. B. Yeats “as he looked in 1913,” quite recently atabout 2 a.m. Aged about forty-eight, Yeats’s hair was dark “and beautiful hiseyes brilliant, his smile reassuring.”9 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt234]Appearing physically real, Yeats placed his arms around her, saying, “I havecome to thank you about John Quinn. He did so much for me. I know I never gavehim sufficient appreciation but now I know how much he deserved.” Deeply moved,Jeanne described herself as “trembling with joy and worship,” convinced that“the seed will flower” and that she might yet be able to do something “that willprove to you [Londraville] that the barrier of time has indeed been broken.”10[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt235]The problem with accounts of Crowley in the context of Jeanne Robert Foster’scareer is that they were composed “without fear of contradiction,” for whenwritten, a historical consensus had long since coagulated into a respectablyestablished notion that Crowley was mad, bad, and dangerous to know, andhistorically and artistically insignificant to boot. Therefore, if a beautiful,intelligent, historically significant lady got involved with him, she must havebeen “duped.” Dark forces! Dracula! One feels biographers should have taken alittle more notice of what an experienced lawyer had to say about Crowley. Whileopining to William Butler Yeats that Crowley was “a perfect misfit here ofcourse” whose “writings have no popular appeal,” John Quinn was professionallyquick to dismiss hear-say. “One hears awful things about him but beyond acapacity for strong drink I have seen nothing crooked about him.”11[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt236] One would think a top corporate lawyer wouldhave had an experienced nose for crooked goings-on! The worst William ButlerYeats could throw at Crowley, when complaining to his father, was a tale he saidhe picked up in Cambridge about Crowley being made to leave his college diningroom for telling obscene jokes! Even if true (which is doubtful), such mightqualify him for a role in Saturday Night Live (as was) or National Lampoon’sAnimal House, but not a virgin-sucking shreck-film!Back in 1915, or in his own lifetime, so to speak, Yeats wrote again to Quinn onJune 24 from 18, Woburn Buildings, Euston Road, London.I send you with this a weekly paper with an article upon Frank Harris which willamuse you. He and Crowley and Moore*98 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft98] areliterary outlaws—unscrupulous in differing degrees with the one virtue ofcourage. Moore is the best of the three, I imagine. I would never however, havemade his acquaintance if I had known that he had red hair which fills me withalarm in man or in woman, but unluckily time had blanched it when we met.12[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt237]Crowley’s own reflective or reactionary account of their relationship in hisConfessions also suffers from the passage of years and the bitterness of lovethwarted. He had by the 1920s got used to his own rationalization of theirrelationship as being a part of the path that led him to the grade of Magus;thus Jeanne is presented as “the Cat Officer” or “Pasht,” as well as “Hilarion”(a name she herself chose, linked to a mahatma of Theosophical lore): theScarlet Woman. He would come to think of the key women of the period asparticipants in an Egyptian temple drama where animal-masked figures playedroles in magical initiation. This mytho-manic model hinders understanding ofevents as they happened at the time.There is a notably sour rendering of their first private meeting at the NationalArts Club.We lost no time. She told me—a string of lies—of her loveless marriage with anold satyr [Matlack Foster] who had snatched her almost from the cradle. She wasabout to divorce him; and having loved me at first sight, not sensually, but asmy spiritual sister, we could be married quite soon. We sealed the sacramentwith a kiss; and there was no reason why, in the ordinary course of events, weshould not have proceeded to an immediate liaison.13[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt238]One presumes the meeting was rather pure pleasure, with interestingundercurrents. What is notable is that Crowley never once mentions the fact thatJeanne had been involved for years in a painful, guilty love affair with themarried Albert Shaw. Crowley would complain of a nagging intuition that Jeanne,despite his enormous love for her, and despite all her promises, was somehow“false,” a fissure in love’s mirror somehow reflected in the dye Jeanne appliedto keep her fabulous red and gold locks pristine. This idea of Jeanne’sfalseness led Spence to suggest it could be accounted for if Jeanne had beenobserving Crowley on behalf of British intelligence. No evidence has emergedthat British officials regarded Jeanne as any more than a useful, friendlyjournalist, though friendly journalists were very useful indeed to the Britishpropaganda effort. Crowley never let on about his secret role, and if she hadone, she never did either. However, in context, the accusation of falseness froma romantic man must surely relate to the lady’s capacity to be true to Love, tosurrender all to Love and count the world well lost. What I suspect Crowleyobserved was that she was holding back something significant from him, somethingthat, behind his back, relativized the absoluteness of her loving words.Jeanne was a “player,” a professional, ambitious early twentieth-century womanwho knew the transactional value of her precious beauty and recognized the needfor linking herself to strong, influential men to get on in life and secure herfuture (Matlack was the first of a select line). No doubt Jeanne was athoroughly charming player, of exemplary sweetness, warmth, and idealism, butshe was also fascinated by the mystery of her own being and believed that magicunlocked secrets in that regard. Here, with Aleister Crowley, was an opportunityto learn new things at many levels that interested her: art, poetry, magic,psychology, England—and power. And if Crowley’s suppressed suspicion was rightabout her being false—that is, willing to deconsecrate their love ifnecessary—the painful intuition would be proved right, eventually anddevastatingly.We can be certain that Jeanne was false about declaring an exclusive love forhim, insofar as she was still involved, and tied emotionally, sensually—andfinancially—to Albert Shaw, though she knew that relationship could never flowerin marriage so long as her and Shaw’s spouses lived. Nor, in the recesses of herheart, had she forgotten Willie Yeats, nor would she ever. Furthermore, herhusband, a pastor’s son whose mind she did not respect, though an invalidwithout attraction now, had made her New York life possible; he had brought herfrom humble status to the gates of professional paradise. How would it appear ifshe dropped him now?For the duration of the passion, Crowley expected complete spiritual commitment,or at least a shameless honesty. Jeanne wanted to appear modest; she had anideal of herself as a good and noble creature, sent into the world to care, tominister to the needs of others, above all to find herself spiritually. Herpersonal feelings could either help or obstruct that. But she was also a womanwho loved adventure, personal freedom, carefree changes of direction, enjoyingan ambivalent relationship with her own manifest sensuality. If it was a choicebetween Art and “love,” her mind said Art must win. Crowley always liked a womanwho was “proud of her whoredom,” but Jeanne had never gone to the limits in thisregard, as far as we can tell, though she had modeled her staggering nudity fora photographer dedicated to Art: an amazing step itself given the character ofthe times. She well understood how men desired to gaze on . . . beauty. Butbeauty was an ideal, and flesh, flesh could be troubling, offering bliss andpain and guilt and longing, and distraction from the business of life: survival.She was an Adirondacks girl, tough from the hard woods. Still, for that vitalcomponent of happy whoredom (in the old English sense of the term), Crowley hadHelen Westley, while still clinging to a conviction that Jeanne represented thepoetic ideal he had long sought. Indeed, he would come to see his being pulledbetween the two women as an ordeal between the ideal (wisdom) and thefoolish/selfish, and while he would eventually damn Jeanne herself for failingto be ideal, in his eyes he satisfied himself that he had, at least, chosen theideal over the vain, even if the “ideal” had not. How he manifested this choicewill seem most bizarre, even perverse.Back in his apartment after the Arts Club meeting, Crowley performed a solitaryact of sex magick, imagining Jeanne as Babalon. But just as Crowley realizedlike a bolt from the blue that she was the One, Jeanne herself left town, notfor the last time leaving Crowley bereft, emotionally vulnerable, listing.Old habits die hard, though in Crowley’s case they never died. On June 13 in acooler spell at the end of a hot afternoon Crowley performed an operation withLaura Brown, a “Scorpio mulatto wench, about 30, very vile, horrible, andfascinating.”14 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt239] He would paint her portrait.15[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt240] An operation dedicated to “Energy,” the resultastounded him: “a burst of energy that I had not had the like of since I landedin New York. Poetry, dress-designing, magazine-conceiving, regular work, &c.,all in a bunch.”16 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt241] This eruption may well havebirthed his still unpublished book of poems, The Golden Rose, devoted wholly toJeanne Robert Foster. This woman, he would write, “possessed a uniqueatmosphere. I can only describe it as ‘sweetness long drawn out.’ Thistranslated itself in terms of rhythm.”17 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt242] Hebelieved God willed them as one, before creation was begun.KNIGHT-ERRANTI came beneath the holy hillWhence jets the spring of Life-in-Youth;Upon its summit flowers stillThe golden rose of Love-in-Truth.My lips, that desert suns devoured,Were moist and merry at the draught;And in that dew of sunlight showeredI stood and shook myself, and laughed.Lightly I leapt upon the slopeTo gain the golden rose above;Outpacing faith, outsoaring hope,I had no rival left but love . . .Mine arms are stretched to North and South,A scarlet cross, a soldier sun;The rose is music on my mouth,Holiness to Hilarion!I mark the bounds of space and time;I suck salvation from the sod;I point the way for man to climbUp to his consummation, God.Crowley sought “Magic Force” through an operation with Laura Brown aftermidnight on June 27, followed up in late afternoon by Opus LXX with Leila IdaBathurst Nerissa Waddell for “Success in Art.” Commenting on the operation inRex de Arte Regia in October, he reflected, “The whole summer has been an orgyof creation: The Golden Rose, The Savior &c.” A geyser of creative writing hadbeen immediately uncorked, though mostly “of a political character.” The nextday he placed “about five articles” in various publications. Three days later,page 12 of the Fatherland featured the following ad for the International.The articles by Aleister Crowley, recently published in the International andthe Fatherland have created universal discussion and comment. These remarkablerevelations of modern England have gone around the world. Everybody is askingfor more. In the July number of the International we shall publish Crowley’sastounding study of a dead king: “The Blunders of Edward the Seventh.” Thearticle will grip you. You will be carried away by the tale of an old man whoseprejudices have blossomed out into the greatest war in history.The Fatherland’s cover story that day—“The Lusitania Was a Battleship”—attemptedto persuade American civilians that they would be safer if the U.S. governmentcategorically forbade arms shipments and insisted on absolute neutrality. Germanintellectuals loved absolutes. Unlike Balzac, they did not search for theabsolute; they believed they had it. Such was Hegel’s painful legacy.In Jeanne’s testing absence, Crowley’s frustrations began to boil over.Confessions reveals only some of his anxieties. “I did not feel that I wasadvancing in the confidence of the Germans. I got no secrets worth reporting toLondon, and I was not at all sure whether the cut of my clothes had notoutweighed the eloquence of my conversation.”18 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt243]Crowley resorted to Doris Gomez again on June 30: an operation for “MoralForce.” Results were, he believed, very good. “I have been completely awakenedto a proper sense of duty, and have worked hard and consistently.”19[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt244] Perhaps moral force had something to do with thenext, rather complex performance his difficulties and duties seemed, to hisanxious mind, to force upon him.THE STATUE OF LIBERTY STUNTTo convince his German colleagues that he was all out, or all in for theanti-British cause, he cooked up “something more public.” He wrote, as he putit, a “long parody” on the Declaration of Independence and applied it toIreland.There existed in 1915 of course no republic of Ireland ’cept in the dreams ofrebels and sympathetic activists. But Crowley would declare it. At 2:16 a.m. onJuly 2 he performed operation number 73 (the qabalistic number of hokmah =wisdom) with Doris for “Power over men”; that is, rhetorical power throughpolitical statement. He described the result as “one of the most remarkable yetdone.”20 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt245] He slept at 3:00 a.m., got up again at6:00 a.m. and worked “as inspired and vigorous as possible,” not stopping until,at 4:43 a.m. of the next day (July 3), he had proclaimed the Irish Republic.“Never in history (I imagine) has a political movement of the first importancebeen conceived, prepared, and executed at such short notice.” He was probablyright, and never in his life would he succeed in such a short amount of time ofstoring up so much grief for himself personally.We shall leave the details until the rest of the world saw them; that is, onJuly 13 in the New York Times. Had there been any intention to report the stuntcloser to the day of its occurrence, any such expectation would be wiped away bya dramatic turn of events that proved, if proof were needed, that Crowley’slife, while full of extraordinary coincidences, was nonetheless plagued byequally extraordinary bad timing—and yet, what unfolded was central tohighlighting the significance of Crowley’s apparently free-lance propagandaactivities, for anyone prepared to see it.“Britain seeking $300m loan at 5% interest.” Printed on page 4 of the Sun onJuly 2, this story was the context for what occurred the next day. The Sunreported secret negotiations were progressing between Britain and the J. P.Morgan Bank. Investors reckoned a figure of $100 million would get a betterresult. Paying for the war was straining Britain’s resources. First Lord of theAdmiralty Winston Churchill’s attempt to break the Western Front deadlock byopening a new front at the Dardanelles in Turkey (Germany’s ally) had beenbotched. According to the Sun, Prime Minister Asquith admitted to more than7,000 killed, more than 35,000 wounded, and more than 6,000 missing.Saturday, July 3, the news that ex-president of Mexico Porfirio Díaz was deadmight have made headlines in prewar days, but something more shocking hadhappened. On the very day of Crowley’s Irish Independence stunt, the EveningWorld announced front-page: JP MORGAN SHOT BY CRANK, WIFE GRAPPLES WITHASSASSIN—TEACHER OF GERMAN INVADES HOME AT GLEN COVE AND WOUNDS BANKER.The paper described Morgan as “agent of the British government in the purchaseof war supplies.” The assassin was named as Cornell languages instructor FrankHolt, “of German descent.” Another column linked the Morgan assassinationattempt to conspiracy. A bomb exploded in Washington, linked to a letter fromWashington to Holt signed “R. Pearce.” The papers struggled to get the facts,and where they couldn’t, speculated. Page 2 declared: TO MAKE MORGAN STOP WARSUPPLIES HIS AIM, SAYS HOLT. German ambassador von Bernstorff was reported to bein seclusion, MENACED, ran the headline, by more than one hundred threateningletters.The July 3 Tribune reported the terror in Washington: BOMB EXPLOSION WRECKSPUBLIC ROOM IN CAPITOL. In an adjacent column, GERMANS MOVE ON WARSAW, While[HEINZ] HADENBERG, SELF-CONFESSED GERMAN SECRET SERVICE MAN, TELLS HOW HEDELIBERATELY SACRIFICED GIRL TO ASCERTAIN IF THERE WERE GUNS ABOARD THELUSITANIA.And this was the day Crowley chose for his stunt!More details of the Morgan assassination attempt on Long Island emerged the nextday in the Tribune (July 4!): JP MORGAN SHOT BY PRO-GERMAN FANATIC WHO SETSENATE BOMB; CONDITION GOOD.Page 3 gave the official German reaction. All concerned were on the New YorkPropaganda Kabinett. GERMANS MOVED TO HORROR BY MORGAN ATTACK. ANTI-GERMAN PLOTFEARED BY VIERECK. “Captain Karl Boy-Ed, German Naval Attaché, and aide of Countvon Bernstorff, the German Ambassador, who has been in seclusion for severaldays, also refused to comment on the attack. He said: ‘Every fair minded mancondemns an attempt at deliberate murder. It is a crime. But why shouldGermany’s representative be called upon to discuss it?’” Captain von Ebererdismissed fears: “As a matter of fact, there is no German conspiracy. Why shouldGermans conspire against a friendly nation? . . . Victor Ridder, manager of the‘New Yorker Staats-Zeitung’ decried the story that the attack upon Mr. Morgan’slife was part of a German conspiracy to prevent the negotiation of a proposed$100m war loan by his firm as a malicious fabrication, designed to discredit theGerman cause among Americans.” “George Sylvester Viereck, editor of theFatherland regarded the attempt to connect the attempted assassination ofMr. Morgan with a German conspiracy, as a deliberate plot to create a nationwideanti-German feeling in this country. He made this statement: ‘Violence is out ofplace in a democracy. For that reason I deeply regret the attack upon Mr.Morgan. We must reform systems not individuals; not the bullet, but the ballot.Not the bomb, but the vote is the weapon of enlightenment. . . . I feel that theinsinuation by responsible newspapers of so monstrous an accusation is moredespicable than the crimes which they attempt to saddle upon the Germans.’”Lower down on the page, FANATIC’S BULLETS HURT CAUSE OF GERMANY, SAY EDITORIALS;WASHINGTON OFFICIALS SHOCKED AT SHOOTING. The paper carried photographs of thebombed Senate reception room. One can only imagine Crowley wincing somewhat atthe contrast of the visible destruction with his declaration of Irishindependence. What might that involve? Nevertheless, through the haze we can nowsee clearly why Crowley was determined to undermine Viereck and his colleagues’carefully articulated stance that Germans were decent and respected democracy.On July 6, the Evening World reported Holt was the same man as a ProfessorMünter of Harvard who killed his wife and had been on the run since 1906—anaccount denied elsewhere by Holt’s wife, who indicated that she did not know himbefore 1908. On the same day (July 6) Berlin recalled secret agent Rintelen vonKleist. Spence suspects the recall points to the German agent’s coordinatinghardball attempts to bully the U.S. government into compliance with Germany’sneutrality demands. Von Kleist, on this hypothesis, controlled the “Frank Holt”who, with pistol in hand and bombs in pockets, pumped two bullets into J. P.Morgan on Long Island’s north shore while Morgan breakfasted with Britishambassador Cecil Spring-Rice. Spring-Rice was himself a constant target ofFatherland articles.Spence suspects that Münter’s being friend and colleague to Hugo Münsterbergexplains Rintelen’s order to quit the United States.21[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt246] Such would also explain Crowley’s insistencethat Münsterberg was a considerably more dangerous figure than British NavalIntelligence deemed him. Crowley needed intelligence assistance. He felt hisposition was desperate; Viereck wasn’t stupid, and the shit was coming downthick and fast.On August 4 a local coroner would pass a verdict that the imprisoned Münter haddied from injuries incurred after leaving a letter to his family then somehowwalking through an unlocked jail door to jump several stories to his death.Rintelen von Kleist had left New York the previous day, only to be seized atPortsmouth Harbor, England, on the well-apprised orders of N.I.D. head AdmiralHall.The day after Morgan’s shooting hit the headlines, a lovestruck Jeanne RobertFoster wrote to John Butler Yeats, asking subtly about a new sonnet she’dwritten, inspired by Crowley writing sonnets for her. She hoped the elder Yeatswould volunteer his views on the poet and mage. Yeats asked Jeanne to sit for aportrait; that would give him time to work on her mind. Jeanne said she wasn’tfeeling well enough. She asked Yeats directly what he thought of AleisterCrowley, from whom she hoped to acquire secrets of magic. Yeats weighed hiswords and loaded his phrases, having discussed Crowley with son Willie.I have met Crowley and enjoyed his conversation very much, principally I thinkbecause of my profound distrust of the talker. I think he is a man to beware of.No one seems to think well of him. He has an ambiguous history—queer happenings,which probably rumour has further distorted. Learn magic by all means, but becareful of the magician. They that sup with the devil must have a long spoon.22[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt247]Damning. Was he suggesting that she might better learn from a differentmagician, his son? John Butler Yeats advised Jeanne firmly not to write toCrowley, or put anything down about him in writing, lest, presumably, Crowleyuse letters for blackmail with her husband or other parties. Jeanne seems tohave kept to this in the main, though the Confessions refers to a telegramCrowley allegedly received in mid-July to explain why she hadn’t been able toinform him that she’d left the city. Lack of communication explains some ofCrowley’s extreme frustration, not hearing from her or receiving what loversnormally expect, regular encouragement on paper if not in the flesh. Jeannephoned him when she thought necessary. He said she drove him half crazy, keepinghim on “pins and needles.”23 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt248] One can see how allthis could conspire to make him think her false.Three days after Jeanne wrote to John Butler Yeats, she returned to Crowley (andto New York) and gave herself to him. There is something distinctly unpleasantabout seeing Jeanne’s details in Crowley’s sex magick diary, right after OpusLXXV with Doris Gomez, whose Object had been “sammasati” (or “rightremembrance”) to appreciate properly his “spiritual position in relation to thecosmos.” It meant meditating through the logic of events by which the meditatorhad arrived at the present; it might involve tracing previous “incarnations.” Hewas perhaps trying to under-stand what line had brought him to Jeanne.In the July 8 record for Opus LXXVI, Jeanne is described as a “respectablemarried woman, artistic &c.” Crowley pondered her “very fine horoscope, her sunexactly on my moon and her moon progressed at time of our meeting to exact placeof my sun.” The Object was a male child, which perhaps they had discussed; wedon’t know. In fact, Jeanne was unable to have children and was not disposed totell him, if indeed she was herself absolutely certain of the fact. “TheOperation was admirable in all respects; but its issue being uncertain, theearly concentration was not very good, and there was much anxiety to bring soimportant an affair to a satisfactory conclusion. Again, at the end the orgasmwas rather over-whelming; and I was bashful [a very rare word in Crowley’svocabulary] about obtaining the Elixir in the usual manner. However, the smallquantity secured was well combined and of first rate quality.” It is doubtful atthis stage how much Jeanne knew about IX° magick; she told Crowley that shefound the physical side of love disgusted her. Crowley would have put that downto past ignorance, of herself, or in those with whom she had made love. Crowleywas used to bringing women satisfaction.The night of July 10 was warm, “the air full of moisture.” At 10:29 p.m.,Aleister and Jeanne made love again. Crowley deviated from his usual style of“write-up.” “This in fact is real passion, though yet very young. So, too, theelixir lay almost undisturbed in the cucurbit.” He obviously did not wish toupset her with the nitty-gritty details of sex magick. Jeanne gave him her birthdate—March 10—but subtracted a good five years. Crowley thought she was thirty,ten years his junior; she was thirty-five, though it was quite common for ladiesto present themselves in this way. But Crowley was very intuitive.Just after half past midnight on the twelfth, Crowley performed sexual magick(Object: “money”) with one Helen Sullivan, a “small slim keen girl; amateur withno objection to profit if possible, Sun in Pisces, probably Aquarius rising, acashier at Rothenburg’s.” Rothenberg & Co. was a popular gift shop, specializingin toys on West 14th Street. Crowley needed cash as for some reason “all thesprings had run dry” during the past three weeks. Was not Evangeline Adamssubbing him for the astrology work? Undertaken “on the spur of the moment at theconclusion of a rather Panic day,” the operation was, for all that, “prettygood.” He added curiously, “There is some question, however, as to whether thewhole affair is not a deceit of the devil.”According to the Confessions, it was not many days after “Hilarion” and Crowleyreconsecrated themselves “to Love’s service” that she went off again withoutwarning. He said his reaction was that of any man determined to resistdomination by an amour. On July 13 he decided to heed the come-on signalsemanating from cynical actress Helen Westley. This way, he told himself, hewould prove he was not under the influence of Jeanne Robert Foster; he was stilla free man. Without abandoning the ideal, he would extract curious revenge onJeanne’s toying with his feelings by hurting Helen with brutal rudeness andsadistically biting her, by his own depraved account.24[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt249]July 13 LXXIX Helen Westley née Mamé [not her maiden name]. Divorced actress.Aet [aged] 40. Slim dark probably Scorpio [?] rising. A most expert persontechnically, extremely passionate, and intriguing like Euphemia Lamb.*99[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft99] Object. A child by Hilarion.25[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt250]A psychologist of great experience and imagination might be able to makesomething of what Crowley in his Confessions asserted happened immediately afterhis twelve-hour debauch with Helen Westley. After the “orgy,” a sleep ofexhaustion, or petit mort, followed by an awakening at dawn where he felt“inscrutably purged of iniquity,” knowing himself “innocent in a sense moresublime than any imagination can conceive.” He entered, he recalled, a trance heinsisted was “one of the greatest experiences of my life.”26[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt251] He said he awoke into a vision of “Pure Love,”symbolized as a diamondlike cube of white light: complete perfection, withnothing else but itself, not even radiant for there was no space. He says his“gross mind vanished.” When he thought of Hilarion he felt no emotion orattachment. There was no clinging, no desire, no fear. For him this was supremeemancipation. He took the transition, stimulated by stress of anxiety plusextreme sex, as a spiritual experience, as a coming through of an ordeal. He hadconquered, at least so he thought, the possessiveness and anxiety of theobsessed lover.What his mind had done was to place him back into the state whence he drew hisconfidence: solitary detachment, objectivity. That he identified this conditionwith “Pure Love” is instructive.Perhaps one also senses the unearthly euphoria that might greet one who deepdown knew he had done things of extreme stupidity, thought of which might havebeen abysmally embarrassing, one whose only escape from a pang of incipientresponsibility was either shame (which Crowley routinely dismissed as part ofthe “sin-complex”), or a blissful assumption to godlike elevation from theaction-reaction universe in which, Buddhistically speaking, man is normallyembedded and driven by. For Crowley, mysticism “cleared” him. He would in duecourse come to see the entire drama of Helen and Hilarion as a necessary“ordeal”: a testing by the gods of his fitness to stand apart from humanity anddeclare a Word humanity did not recognize and whose results might only manifeston the spiritual plane, far from “mere” human passion.There’s only one problem with the vision of pure love as recorded in theConfessions—its date. In the long considered lost, but now recovered, Rex deArte Regia diaries (unproofed copy from William Breeze) covering June 27, 1915,to February 9, 1916, the entire diamondlike cube “Pure Love” trance is given asthe “Result” of Opus XCVI, August 24, 1915, 1:35 a.m., undertaken with HelenWestley, whose Object was “Thanks to God for Hilarion,” qualified as follows:“The idea was this: suppose H[ilarion] as is possible has befooled and betrayedme, has taken my heart for her sport, torn it out, mangled it, and trampled onit. Then, still, thank God for Hilarion.” Crowley compared the trance to his1906 experience of “holding” the complete vision of the “Holy Guardian Angel,”or “Glittering One”: the culmination of Abra-Melin. The 1915 diary entry reads,“This is one of the great experiences of my life. Curious that the 1906 successalso came through a magical Thanksgiving under stress of passion.”Furthermore, the recovered diary also shows that Crowley’s extreme anxiety overHilarion’s leaving New York without warning took place not on July 13 (Crowleyand Jeanne actually made love on July 14) but on August 23. Why Crowley shouldhave transposed the vision to that of the twelve-hour operation with Helen, July13, 1915, cannot be answered with certainty, though it might have suggesteddramatically that his resorting to Helen Westley’s embrace was caused byapparent indifference to his feelings on Hilarion’s part. It all has the whiffof special pleading. One suspects that he slept with Helen Westley because hefound her irresistible. Crowley’s line “I knew myself innocent in a sense moresublime than any imagination can conceive” is, I’m sure, his perverse idea of ajoke. It means that he was guilty as hell, and perverse enough to put the blameon Mame (or “Mamé”!); that is, femme fatale. Did Crowley ever say no? Rarely. Inthe recovered diary entry for July 13, 12:09 a.m., Crowley wrote that he had nolove or desire for Helen Westley “but was disappointed in not hearing fromHilarion as arranged, and suspected an attempt to deprive me of the Champion’sBelt of the World’s Leg-Pulling Association which I have worn with modesty anddistinction for over five years”—that is, that Hilarion was “having him on,”toying with him. Crowley added, “My real doubt is whether I should not have keptto Hilarion at whatever cost to my self-respect. These two Helens [referring toHelen Sullivan] are lunar women, and I want the Sun. At least I kept her in mindas the Object.”So much for the Great Ordeal!The day of Crowley’s alleged amorous frenzy—July 13—happened also to be the daythe New York Times put Crowley’s Liberty stunt on its front page, an event notwithout results of its own, severe and lasting, for Crowley took “liberty” forall it was worth.IRISH REPUBLIC BORN IN NEW YORK HARBORTen Patriots at Daybreak Renounce Allegiance to England Near Statue of LibertyIndependence is DeclaredSympathy with Germany, They Say, a Matter of Expediency—Then They Breakfast atJack’sAs dawn was slowly spreading over the city on the morning of July 3, athirty-foot launch slipped from the recreation pier at the foot of West 50thStreet and glided down the Hudson. On board were ten persons, silent and seriouswith the consciousness of what was to them a profoundly solemn and significantceremony.In the prow of the boat was Aleister Crowley, Irishman-poet, philosopher,explorer, a man of mystic mind—the leader of an Irish hope. Of nearly middle ageand mild in manner, with the intellectual point of view colored with cabalisticinterpretation, Crowley is an unusual man, capably so to those who believe andfeel in common with him. He has spent years exploring in Persia, India, andTibet, and he is the author of several volumes of translations of the earlywritings of those countries. He is said to be a close friend of William ButlerYeats, the Irish poet, and he has written several Irish poems himself [!].In the boat also was Miss Leilah Waddell, whose mother was an Irish refugee ofthe last generation and who believes herself an Irish patriot. She is aviolinist and has appeared publicly on several occasions since her recent comingto America. And among those in the exotic party were one J. Dorr, an Irisheditor who has published papers in both Ireland and England, and Patrick Gilroy,an Irish agitator. All of those in the launch were Irish. Most of them have cometo this country since the beginning of the war.Ready to War on EnglandThe members of the party consider themselves members of the secret RevolutionaryCommittee of Public Safety of the Provisional Government of the Irish Republic,and their early morning mission of July 3 was to declare the independence of theIrish Republic, which included a declaration of war against England, and topledge their allegiance to the government of their vision.The little launch passed from the river into the bay and stopped off Bedloe’sIsland, under the Statue of Liberty. The time and place chosen for the ceremonywere considered brightly propitious. There was the poetic significance of thedawn, the great figure of Liberty enlightening the world was symbolic of thedreamed-of republic, the season was the anniversary of the Declaration ofIndependence of the United States. And the leader of the party, Crowley, inwhose mysticism there is something of astrology, had read the heavens and foundthat the conjunction of certain stars was auspicious for Ireland at exactly 4:32o’clock on the morning of July 3.So, with the launch a few feet off Bedloe’s Island, at the moment of 4:32o’clock, Crowley rose to begin the ceremony. He said:“I have not asked any great human audience to listen to these words; I hadrather address them to the unconquerable ocean that surrounds the world, and tothe free four winds of heaven. Facing the sunrise, I lift up my hands and mysoul herewith to this giant figure of Liberty, the ethical counterpart of theLight, Life, and Love which are our spiritual heritage. In this symbolical andmost awful act of religion I invoke the one true God of whom the sun himself isbut a shadow that he may strengthen me in heart and hand to uphold that freedomfor the land of my sires, which I am come hither to proclaim.“In this dark moment, before the father orb of our system kindles with his kissthe sea, I swear the great oath of the Revolution. I tear with my hands thistoken of slavery, this safe conduct from the enslaver of my people, and Irenounce forever all allegiance to every alien tyrant. I swear to fight to thelast drop of my blood to liberate the men and women of Ireland, and I call uponthe free people of this country, on whose hospitable shores I stand an exile, togive me countenance and assistance to my task of breaking those bonds which theybroke for themselves 138 years ago.Unfurl Irish Flag“I unfurl the Irish flag. I proclaim the Irish Republic. Erin go Bragh. God saveIreland.”As the bits of the torn English passport scattered over the surface of the waterthe Irish flag, a green field supporting a golden harp, flapped free in thebreeze from a mast in the bow of the boat.Solemnly then the Declaration of Independence of Ireland was read. It is:We, the secret Revolutionary Committee of Public Safety of the ProvisionalGovernment of the Irish Republic, hereby authorize our spokesman and delegate,Brother Aleister Crowley, No. 418,*100 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft100] in ourname and in our behalf, to promulgate the proclamation following:In so grave a circumstance of human affairs as the declaration of war orrevolution, it is customary that those whose conscience and free-will alikeimpel them to take up arms against other men, should state openly the causes oftheir resorting to so dread efficacy of protest.Peace and good-will are the ruling passions of the better sort among mankind;and for these to turn therefrom argues the existence of a state intolerable tofree men. We hold this truth to be self-evident, that all men and women arecreated unequal; and our justice wills that this prejudice of nature beredressed, so far as is possible to human effort, by assuring to each and everyone of them equality of rights before the law, and the right to make, alter, orrepeal that law itself; and, by assuring to each and every one of them freedomto develop the powers of the soul, spiritual, moral, mental, or physical withoutinterference from any other person or persons, so far as that development mayprove compatible with the equal rights of others.Right to RebelTo obtain these advantages of security and freedom is the object of all propergovernment; and it is not only the right of every man for himself, but his dutyto his neighbor, to refuse obedience to any authority which does not serve itspeople to this end with loyalty and fidelity. What then must be the right andduty of every member of a nation not only misgoverned, but governed for thepurpose of exploitation by an alien, usurping, and inferior race?For many centuries this particular wrong has been suffered with a patience andgentleness not unworthy of the Saviour of Mankind, by the Irish people; but asto endure oppression with meekness is the pride and prerogative of God, it isnot for man to usurp it. The free and independent spirit of the people ofIreland is weary of the continued crimes of the English tyrants; and, seeing noend possible but the success of the oppressors in their systematic annihilationof the people, dares the desperate alternative of revolt.For, as is notorious in every country of the inhabited globe, the deliberatepolicy of England from the first conquest of Ireland has been endowed with thatadmirable virtue of consistency which is the spine of good intention, but inthis case props the determination to destroy a people.The land of Ireland has been stolen from the people of Ireland, both by armedaggression and by the chicaneries of unjust law.The labor of Ireland has been sterilized and thwarted by the envy of Britishindustries.The people of Ireland have been enslaved by a ferocious constabulary, militia,and soldiery, enforcing laws intended to weaken the people directly by coercionor indirectly by impoverishment. The right of political action has been deniedto them, and the sacrilegious hand of atheistic oligarchy has been lifted evenagainst the freedom of religious thought.The means of private assassination and of public massacre have been freelyemployed against the people, and when even the soldier turned with disgust fromthe task of a butcher, famine and pestilence were deliberately brought upon theland by the calculating craft of the robbers, tyrants, and murderers that bearrule over them.So comprehensive, so infamous, and so continuous a conspiracy is unparalleled inthe annals of humanity; and were we to precise and to detail the crimes againstour people which already overload the scroll of the recording angel, and nowbare the sword of the avenging angel of God, we think that not even earth itselfcould contain the document of their mere enumeration.Hatred of Their TyrantNor have the Irish people been inactive in measures directed to appease theunnatural hatred of their tyrant. They have sought by every lawful means toobtain some alleviation of our sempiternal suffering. They have made politicalovertures only to be rejected, or nullified by the adroitness of the lawyer.They have sacrificed freely their best blood, for their sons have been the bestsoldiers of the usurper; and England has answered by their deliberate massacrein battle.We believe that earth itself revolts at the recital of these tyrannies andtreasons; we believe that God Himself is weary of beholding these intolerableevils; and we believe in consequence that the hour is come when desperationshould be transformed into resolution, patience inflamed to wrath, and Peace,folding her wings upon her face, mournfully beckon war.We, therefore, the secret Revolutionary Committee of Public Safety of theProvisional Government of the Irish Republic, by the mouth of our trusty andwell-beloved delegate and spokesman, Brother Aleister Crowley, No. 418, dodecree and proclaim:That, we put our trust and confidence in the Judge of the whole world, appealingto Him to witness the righteousness of our intent.That, declaring England the enemy of civilization, justice, equality, andfreedom, and therefore of the human race, we do hereby lawfully establish theRepublic of the Men and Women of the Irish People, free and independent by righthuman and divine, having full power to levy war, conclude peace, contractalliance, establish commerce, and to do all other things which independentStates may of right do.Repudiate England3. That we do hereby dissolve all political connection between that Republic andthe usurper, absolving of their allegiance to England (a) all free people ofgood will that are of Irish blood, (b) all free people of good will born inIreland, (c) all free people of good will who may hereafter desire to partake ofthe benefits of the Irish Republic, and effectually acquire these rights by theforms provided.4. That, we do hereby declare war upon England until such time as our demandsbeing granted, our rights recognized, and our power firmly established in ourown country, from which we are now exiled, we may see fit to restore to her theblessings of peace, and to extend to her the privileges of friendship. And for the support of this declaration, with a firm and hearty relianceupon the protection of God, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, ourfortunes, and our sacred honor.Long Live the Irish RepublicThe official copy of this declaration of independence is “signed by order and onbehalf of the committee” by “Aleister Crowley, 418,” and “attested” by “L.Bathurst, 11.”With the conclusion of the reading of the declaration, the launch headed up theHudson River, proceeding near the western shore, Miss Waddell playing patrioticIrish airs on her violin. The music and the large Irish flag, now plainlyvisible in the increasing light, identified the boat to the seamen on the Germanships interned at the Hoboken waterfront, and they cheered the small company ofIrishmen lustily. The Captain of the Hamburg-American line tug which happened tobe standing off with steam up near the Vaterland, turned out into the river andescorted the launch to its landing at Fiftieth Street. Incidentally it was notedby those in the launch that as they passed by the French and English ships atthe piers on the eastern side of the river the sailors on them cheered as loudlyas the Germans had.Breakfast at Jack’sThe party left the launch and went to Jack’s restaurant for breakfast, where anumber of late revelers did not seem to disturb the spirit of their gathering.Legendary New York restaurant on Sixth Ave and 46th Street across from theHippodrome Theater, Jack’s, named after popular personality Jack Dunston, armedwith an all night liquor license, attracted colorful characters, from chorusgirls, poets, and journalists to professional sports-men, playwrights, andfinancial wheeler-dealers. Served quality food and drink by Irish waiters, thehottest names in town could be seen at Jack’s after a night’s entertainment,either in its four dining rooms—the Battling Nelson Grill, the White Room, theRosemary for Remembrance Room, and the Blue Room—or in the long bar and OysterBar in the back.Born in 1853 in Moneyvollahan, Cork, IRA supporter Jack Dunston sent money tothe cause from New York. In 1915 he moved his shared Manhattan Oyster Barbusiness from Sixth Aveue between 43rd and 44th Streets to the site of Burn’sRestaurant, from which he had once been fired as a waiter, vowing he’d return tobuy the place—a feat made possible perhaps through his formidable poker skills!Known as “the Earl of Dunston” for his polite manners, he liked to discuss Irishculture long into the nights.Famous for its 4 a.m. scrambled eggs and Irish bacon, Jack’s was a happy resortfor people who liked character; one can see its interest for Crowley! Writerssuch as Booth Tarkington, Benjamin Decasseres, Frank Ward O’Malley, DamonRunyon, and O Henry frequented Jack’s, as did Theodore Roosevelt and manyTammany Hall leaders. Jack’s accommo-dated political intrigue, and gambling andwould have been an obvious place for Crowley to acquire the constituents of his“revolutionary committee.”27 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt252]Overall, the New York Times treated the declaration seriously, though a hint offarce did not escape the report: A touch of comedy to the ceremonies over whichCrowley and his companions laughed themselves the next day was that the partyhad intended to go through their ritual on the steps at the base of the Statueof Liberty, but, giving more mind to the vision of the Irish Republic than topractical details, those who arranged the journey neglected to obtaingovernmental permission to land on Bedloe’s Island. When the launch stopped atthe dock, therefore, a stolid watchman who displayed neither Irish nor Englishsympathies, but who had fluent command of New York’s most emphatic language,refused to let the patriots set foot on the “land of liberty.” So the ceremonieswere held in the boat while it drifted near the island.The particular avowed purpose of the representatives of the “committee” inAmerica was to spread propaganda that would contribute, at the end of theEuropean war, to the establishment of the Republic of Ireland. Members of thecommittee in Ireland, according to information obtained by a representative ofthe New York Times, were engaged in a secret effort to dissuade Irishmen fromenlisting in the English army. But those members of the committee who would talkof their business at all admitted that there was no immediate intention of anattempt to wage active war on England by the instigation of an armed rebellionin Ireland. It was said that the present purpose of the formal declaration ofwar against England was more to enlist the sympathies of Irish and of Americansto the “cause” than to bring about what even the most visionary enthusiasts ofthe movement recognized as an impracticable war.Aleister Crowley was displeased when the news of the ceremonies at Bedloe’sIsland and of the formation of the “committee” came into the possession of theTimes, and he declined to discuss his plans and purposes further than toacknowledge the fact set forth. An American who is acquainted with Crowley’sbeliefs and intentions, however, while frankly admitting that the Irishmen ofthe “committee” sympathize with Germany in the present war, asserted that thiswas due to anti-English feelings and not to any natural love of things Germaine.The members of the “committee” see in Germany, according to their unofficialspokesman, a factor that will impair the power of England to oppress them. Thatis all.A cool observer of these proceedings and the manner in which Crowley spent July13 might well conclude that the mage had finally gone completely “off hisrocker”; that is to say, that he was mad, not only mad—unhinged—but insanelystupid as well.When he later reflected on the inevitable reaction of British authorities to thestunt, he claimed that he couldn’t believe how conditions had led to them tolose their sense of humor. Couldn’t they see the surreal, ironic humor of itall? No, they couldn’t, and he knew they wouldn’t. He felt himself far abovethem. His laughter echoed among the summits, above the clouds of human folly. Itwas not he who was unbalanced, only those who took the stunt seriously, for thestunt was primarily intended to fool the German propagandists that hisanti-Britishness was such that he was prepared to risk his security as regardsGreat Britain. But it was also a stunt; he thought it hilarious. This has thegob-stopping flavor of a childhood dare—“I’ll show them what I can do!”—and waspsychologically typical of Crowley’s immaturity regarding other people. Crowleydid not expect the Germans to see the funny side, but he expected his friend inLondon, Everard Feilding, to see it, because Feilding knew that he was a“lunatic,” and much else, and Crowley could, he claimed later, rely on Feildingto explain matters to the Naval Intelligence Department and to request that theycooperate with him. He was living on Planet Crowley, incidentally passingthrough the belt of World War I.During late 1923 and 1924, after the Beast was asked to leave Italy by order ofMussolini, ostensibly due to living immorally with two women in Cefalù, Sicily,and for having attracted tabloid publicity to Italy via the English tabloidSunday Express, which falsely accused Crowley of many crimes, includingtreachery to his country, Crowley undertook a long campaign for a just hearing.His devotee, mathematics professor Norman Mudd (1889–1934) agreed to write topersons who knew Crowley, or might be sympathetic to his cause, to offer frankassessments of his character and, if they knew them, motives. Recipients ofMudd’s request included the U.S. Justice Department, Otto Kahn, philosopherBertrand Russell, and the Honorable Everard Feilding, who in July 1915 had beenworking in association with the N.I.D. in the Censor’s Department. Here followsMudd’s previously unpublished letter to Feilding, then a barrister, datedNovember 22, 1924.Your knowledge (however imperfect or patchy) of AC’s work during the war ishighly relevant here. You could say that the fact that he wrote for and editedpro-German organs during the war does not prove for a moment that he was notpro-British. Could you not say again that you had corresponded with him duringthat period, that you did not doubt his loyalty and that he himself says thecircumstances were too complex to be properly explained save in hisautobiography?. . . I am merely venturing to remind you that your knowledge of AC howeverpartial is really more than that of all but a score or two persons in London. Iam sure it is such that you could say whole-heartedly that you would never dreamof taking seriously the allegations that I specially denounce in the absence ofdefinite proof.28 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt253]While Mudd sent out letters, Crowley composed a “Vindication,” which survivestoday as dictated to his then Scarlet Woman, Lea Hirsig.I was plain pro-German in appearance until my Statue of Liberty joke arousedFeilding, whom I felt I could trust having known him for years. But even so, Iused precautions, for example: in going to a cable office, not signing my namebut the code name Edith (in memory of Edith Cavell).*101[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft101](I suspect the real difficulty in understanding me when I began privatenegotiations with the Naval Intelligence, was that I was trying to play a PhilipOppenheim†102 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft102] hero and became super-subtle.)29[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt254]Feilding, meanwhile, replied to Mudd that he was assured of Crowley’s loyaltyfrom letters Crowley sent to him during the war (now “lost”). He reckoned theauthorities “might be” skeptical of Crowley’s intelligence value because of his“admitted taste for farcical situations.”30 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt255] Fiveyears later, Crowley’s then pupil Gerald Yorke (1901–1983) wrote again toFeilding to ascertain for himself Crowley’s loyalties, as Yorke was trying toget some of Crowley’s works published in London and anticipated problems. In aletter of May 1, 1929, Feilding referred to what he received from Crowley in NewYork: “Such as I did not hand over to Intelligence, I destroyed after the war.”During the time that I [Feilding] was a Naval censor at the London Press Bureauand afterwards employed on Intelligence work in Egypt, Crowley wrote to me fromtime to time telling me that he was anxious to do work for the BritishIntelligence and that meanwhile he was doing his best, by various preposterousperformances, to represent himself as disaffected and to get in with Germanconnections. He sent me newspaper accounts, for instance, of his formallyproclaiming Irish independence from the steps of the Statue of Liberty. He alsoasked me to start a defamation campaign against him in the English Press, withthe idea that this would confirm his evil reputation in America so far asBritish allegiance was concerned. While I declined to do this, I sent hisletters on to the intelligence authorities with whom I was personallyacquainted, but this branch of work was in no way my job. I did nothing morebeyond forwarding to Crowley a test question, which they suggested regarding theidentity of a certain personage. Whether it was to test their knowledge againsttheir own, or because they really wanted to know who this personage was, I didnot inquire. Anyway, his answer did not, I understand, prove helpful, andwhether for that or other reasons I know not, they declined any directcommunication with him. [Note the word direct.]I can only add that my own personal very strong belief was and is that, whatevervagaries Crowley may have indulged in, which have caused him to be expelled fromtwo countries as widely different as Italy and France, treachery to his countrywas not one of them.31 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt256]There is no support in any of these documents for Spence’s hypothesis thatCrowley was already an agent of Admiral Hall of the N.I.D. before arriving inNew York in 1914. Help from Quinn, Crowninshield, Cosgrave, and even Belle daCosta Greene may plausibly be accounted for on the basis of recommendations fromAustin Harrison and Raymond Radclyffe, as well as prewar business with JohnQuinn, and Crowley’s friendly relations with Frank Harris. Existing evidencepoints to contact occurring with Commodore Guy Gaunt and New York–basedN.I.D. officers at 44 Whitehall after the Statue of Liberty stunt, at leastafter October (Edith Cavell’s death), possibly even as late as 1916. But then,in July 1915, Crowley admitted in his Confessions that he did not feel he hadgotten far enough into the Propaganda Kabinett’s confidence to be significantlyuseful to British Intelligence (reporting German secrets gained from intimacywith the enemy being his true aim), though Feilding’s concern would havesignaled that he had better get somewhere in that regard with due haste.*103[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft103] Crowley’s dilemma was that, in order toprogress, he felt he needed assistance, but could not get assistance unless heprogressed. Thus, as he emphasized in “The Last Straw” and elsewhere, he wasforced to play a “lone hand”: a miserable position one might even callmasochistic were it not that he wanted to be relieved of it.NORMAL SERVICE RESUMESIn the midst of high pressure on the German propagandists over the Morganassassination and Washington bomb, the July 14 issue of the Fatherland featuredan advertisement for Crowley’s contribution to August’s International. “In thisgripping article [“Lieutenant Finn’s Promotion”] Aleister Crowley brings to yourattention again the Fashoda Incident, in which England humiliated France bycompelling Col. Marchand to haul down the flag of France after he had raised itover the Egyptian Soudan [sic].”†104 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft104] The adappeared the same day as Crowley and Jeanne undertook to get over Jeanne’ssexual difficulties. He noted that she was practically virginal. Nevertheless,the operation, on a hot still night in dim candlelight, was “intenselypassionate,” but there was “not yet that confidence which brings deliberation.”It sounds like a school report. Concentration was lost “in the intensity of apure normal orgasm.” The Elixir also was of “wonderful quality,” but still“normal.” Teacher concluded, “There are evidently great difficulties in Our way:the conscious mind is still in revolt.” The next day he offered to marry “thislady” and was accepted. All perfectly normal.At about 3:00 a.m. on July 15, Crowley confided that his triumph to “the King onthe Royal Art,” a triumph proving Jeanne was not keeping strictly to John ButlerYeats’s advice about writing:Hilarion is mine, and I am hers. I have a wonderful letter from her. She is theHigh Prelate of the Chapter of Rose Croix, come to conduct me from the Valleywherein I have wandered so long into the full light of the Sun. I feel herguiding hand, but it is yet dark. The gates of the Graal Temple are not whollyopen. But I am ready. I leave the devil-loves of the dusk. So tonight once moreI strove to banish them.This he did by kissing Doris Gomez for two hours until he “wore her oututterly,” so utterly that she was unable to perform “her act as priestess.” Hehoped his activities, including light concentration on sammasati would be his“induction to the grade of Magus. Aumn.” He also did a small experiment withheroin. He found it helpful to concentration and erection; it stopped orgasm.The night of July 17 was very hot and steamy, only cleared by a violentthunderstorm at 6:00 a.m. Before then, Jeanne and “A” (as she referred to him inher few highly obscure diary references to him) undertook their fourth act ofsex magick, dedicated to Hilarion’s problems. He had asked her what she mostwanted in the world, and she said—all honey—“You.” The result was a long talkabout everything. He felt he had “got her,” and confidence between them began togrow apace."},{"pageContent":"SEVENTEENimage [images/9781620556313_099.jpg]The Wrong Thing at the Right TimePoint Breeze, Rockaway Point, Long Island, looked rather different in 1915 fromwhat it does today. Lines of single-story wooden huts over-looked the sea, withsloping roofs, verandas, and short steps down to the beach, punctuated by tallflagpoles with Old Glories waving in the sea breeze beckoning a century ofchange. Men and boys wore sleeveless vests of course to cover their torsos andlong shorts, or working pants, rolled up to the knees. There was also a shantyof large tents, the size of garden sheds with makeshift canopies for shade, madewith bedsheets and any old wood, with clothes drying on anything above ground.Ladies and girls wore pleated calico dresses, usually with some covering at theshoulders, and stockings too, with lace-up canvas boots. They might wear awoolen hat to keep some of the hair from getting wet, or because ladies shouldwear something on their heads.“Swimming” generally meant paddling about close to the beach. Farther from thesand stood neat little bungalow colonies, each with a square “garden” at thefront, consisting of a potted plant surrounded by cobbles set in mortar andconcrete.Families, out for a breather on the Rockaway Beach train from Brooklyn or theBronx or Queens or any other place that was hot and airless, alighting atHammels Station (what is now Beach 85th Street), could let themselves go at theRockaway Beach Playland, with its overbearing, wood-framed Wolz Thriller rollercoaster, spiraling, grinding, and rattling above the scenic railway andboardwalk. Children in abundance vibrated the languid air with summer joys, andthe sight of them must have made Crowley and his Scarlet Woman look at eachother knowingly, for the couple were trying their best to conceive—at leastthat’s what Crowley thought.Having spent the afternoon of July 18 swimming, the amorous couple returned toManhattan to dine at the imposing twenty-five-story McAlpin Hotel at the cornerof Broadway and 34th Street. Three years old, the world’s biggest hotel employed1,500 staff, could accommodate 2,500 guests, with gender-specific floors, andhad a Turkish bath on the top floor—perhaps the scene for Crowley’s gayencounters. Constructed in red brick, the mighty building had cream stone facingat top and bottom and was so outstanding that at its opening the New York Timesopined that it seemed completely separate from everything around it. It was likea new volcano born of a social and economic earthquake. Hilarion and the Beastthen went home, whether to Crowley’s or Jeanne’s apartment is not apparent.image [images/9781620556313_042.jpg]Fig. 17.1. The McAlphin Hotel, the largest hotel in the world when it opened in1912A first: Crowley asked Jeanne to decide the Object for their fifth sex-magicalencounter. She chose “the Regeneration of Humanity.” Utterly noble, timely, andCrowley took it as meaning they would create a child, who would, as The Book ofthe Law prophesied, “discover the Key of it all” (AL II:46; III:47) and“regenerate the world, the little world, my sister” (AL I:53).Their attempts at sex were troubled by Jeanne’s feelings about it and Crowley’snervousness. She was unhappy with the physical composites of the experience,embarrassed, and shy about genitalia. He could tell she was resistant tocunnilingus, for example, which made access to the Elixir awkward. She liked thecloseness, the romance, the passion, the feeling, the soul, the love, but notthe vehicles of love; they were not ideal. Beauty was in the mind, the heart,not the flesh. For Crowley, they had long been indistinguishable. He could quoteBlake: “God is in the lowest effects as well as in the highest causes.” “Theresult,” noted Crowley, “was absolute fiasco.” He’d taken wine and cocaine,apparently, to calm his nerves. “The Domina [lady Lord], being to all intentsand purposes a virgin, always does the wrong thing at the right time. No doubtheat, and her amazing beauty, aid this. However, I instructed her in theelements of concentration; she complied; God was in his heaven etc. . . . Orgasmprolonged and splendid.” He added a P.S.: “She is a Super-virgin, and alwaysdoes the right thing at the wrong time!”Another first: on July 21 the Fatherland’s page 1 editorial was written byAleister Crowley—ENGLAND ON THE BRINK OF REVOLUTION. The editor’s bylinereintroduced Crowley, writing, “The author of the following brilliant article isnot only a revolutionary thinker but is actually a revolutionist. The New YorkTimes of July 13th gives a long account of how Aleister Crowley, accompanied byseveral patriotic Irishmen, renounced, in the shadow of the Statue of Liberty inNew York Harbor, all allegiance to England [note!] and declared the birth of theIrish Republic. In the dawning light Crowley solemnly read the new IrishDeclaration of Independence.”Apparently well in at last with the Fatherland team, Crowley wrote of how “thehateful, the loathsome, the despicable Englishman is not of the old aristocracy,or of the peasantry, or of the working classes except in rare cases ofcorruption by cheap literature; he is of the mean, petty, cheating, hypocriticaltradesman type; and unfortunately it is this type that rules the country.”Crowley described a demoralized Britain, created in his imagination for purpose,and concluded, “Of course it is not difficult to foresee the course of events.They will not shoot the workman; they will keep on nagging at him. He willsuddenly come to the end of his patience, run amuck, and burn the rags of theBritish flag, and of the British Constitution, on the altars of Anarchy.”Crowley perhaps could not resist having his own joke on what he considered hiseditors’ naïveté: Britain did not have a written constitution.On Friday, July 23, as the Battle of Warsaw tore in to the heart of Poland andthousands of British, Australian, and New Zealand troops were held down by theTurkish army in the faltering Gallipoli campaign, Crowley and Jeanne were backat Rockaway Beach, having a golden time swimming and cuddling. The previousnight, while performing sex magick with Helen Westley, Crowley had been intenton Jeanne, saying and thinking, “Awake awake Hilarion.” Jeanne, at home in bed,dreamed that she was God “being adored by herself” and, as Crowley puts it,“ulti-mately woke at my call.”1 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt257] Anxious to wastenot a moment, Crowley and Jeanne met up at 7:15 a.m. and headed for Rockaway toenjoy the wonder of sea, sun, and each other. They began to make love in the“shed” (a beach hut for changing clothes, presumably) in the late afternoon,were interrupted by the onset of Jeanne’s period, then dined and continuedlater, “the Elixir roseate and perfect.” They then slept in each other’s armsuntil half-midnight on the Saturday. “This marks a great advance toward thePerfect Union,” wrote Crowley in his record.In Manhattan later that day (July 24) Frank Burke, head of President Wilson’shush-hush intelligence unit deputed to keep an eye on German intrigues, togetherwith a subordinate, followed George Sylvester Viereck and paymaster Dr. HeinrichAlbert onto an uptown electric train. Viereck alighted near Crowley’s address.Burke followed Albert, identifiable from saber scars and a small dark mustache.Having fallen asleep, Albert stumbled out of the train, leaving his briefcase.Burke shared the contents with British naval attaché Captain Guy Gaunt. Contentsincluded Albert’s schemes for establishing phony armaments companies to divertAllied funds and frustrate arms shipments. With what Spence calls Washington’ssilent approval, excerpts from the trove’s incriminating evidence were leaked tothe New York World and published on August 15.2 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt258]The ensuing flap would signal the beginning of the end for Albert, and Germany’smilitary and naval attachés Franz von Papen and Karl Boy-Ed. Not to be outdonein the spying game, the coup was also claimed by one of Gaunt’s principalagents, Emanuel Voska, leader of a Czech spy ring. It was the kind of thingCrowley would like to have been able to claim for himself: he was that close.At July’s end, while not pursuing his writing, Crowley undertook a brief seriesof Operations with Helen Westley aimed at freeing Jeanne from constraints towhat Crowley had interpreted as her “True Will.” “Thy will be done, Hilarion,”was the Object of the first. The second, “Freedom of action for Hilarion” lookedto the future. Jeanne said she wanted “out” from a marriage to Matlack Fostercontracted in 1897 when he was forty-seven and she eighteen. Another opus withHelen on August 1 envisioned a “canoe trip with Hilarion,” perhaps inspired bythe Sun’s July advertisement for pleasure trips up the Hudson River, deep intoNew York State. “You’ll enjoy these Trips up the Hudson, steamers SS TrojanNewburgh Poughkeepsie & connecting there with SS Rensselaer.” Crowley “firmlyvisualized” a “mental picture” of Jeanne and himself in the canoe “among thewoods, or by our camp fire.” Six months later Crowley had to observe, “Nary acanoe yet!” Crowley would not find himself in a canoe up the Hudson betweenPoughkeepsie and Newburgh until summer 1918 when he took a “magicalretirement”—without, alas, Hilarion. Operations culminated on August 2 with theObject “Marriage with Hilarion.” The “Result” was added considerably later inmore bitter than sweet mode: “This came off, so far as it was possible. At thesame time, it was not my True Will, but a romantic idealistic folly.”3[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt259]Well, Crowley’s “all or nothing at all,” black-and-white, in-or-out haste tosecure everything for himself suggests that he never believed absolutely in thelove of a man and a woman as sufficient for himself, “the wanderer of the waste”and “prophet of the lovely Star,” so inclined was he to dismiss on the basis ofa small disappointment, forever impatient, curiously spoiled, harshly critical,and always proud.A reading of Jeanne’s impressive poetry collection, Wild Apples, published bySherman in 1916, offers insights into Jeanne’s emotional and spiritual concernsat the time, which Crowley, had he been less driven and egotistical perhaps,might have benefited from listening to and heeding, but Crowley could not endurethe pains of closeness for long. If Jeanne’s poem Heartache refers to him,Crowley’s sharp, cynical tongue found an occasional target in Jeanne’svulnerability.Beloved, since love’s insight gives to theeSuch power to wound, some secret way to findThe one sad, aching spot within my mind,That from old custom is not quite set free(Yet holding promise of some grace to be),Canst thou not with sweet salve this sore wound bind,And with a soft excuse be gently kind,Knowing thou hast my staunchest fealty—4 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt260]Crowley was used to the cut and thrust, was in many ways battle hardened, inuredto opposition, his feelings long since stripped and shaved to necessity, removedfrom sentimental tenderness. And yet, he loved femininity, and his virility wasalso his defense against passivity, fear of weak-ness, himself. His firstmarriage to Rose Kelly had ended in protracted misery and heartbreak. It hadscalded his reserves of sympathy: the sores were encrusted.It may be the case that Jeanne’s affecting poem The Second Wife Speaks, if itwas not about Albert Shaw, refers to Crowley’s first marriage. Jeanne had neverexperienced the ideal love marriage of which romantics dream. She had had thepassion but not the fulfillment with Albert Shaw, and it grieved her that themen she fell for could so easily “burn the lips of another,” still bound, likeher, to the past. She would like to have been the first wife, pure and perfect.THE SECOND WIFE SPEAKSAye, tell me of those days in ItalyWith her; for I would hark the magic strainThat bridehood sings; no premonitioned painWarps its great hope that feeds on ecstasyAnd thrills with shapes of wonder yet to be.Measure for me each hour, and once againLook deep within my eyes, that once were fainTo veil from thee a woman’s ardency.Findest thou not one day that I may keepFrom out oblivion, where all days run,Nor yet one leaping hour to make me glad.Within my breast a poignard stabbing deep,—That day of days when, proud and all love-mad,She kissed thy lips and told thee of thy son.5 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt261]As for any hope in bearing a child, Jeanne’s poem “The Answer” holds the cluethat her child was a spiritual dream. The poems evince a gnostic sensibilitythat to be attracted to earth through lust of body is not that consummation mostdevoutly to be wished, and better for the unborn soul not to be born, and bettereven for the enfleshed soul not to drag down immortality to mortality and pain.Jeanne is sad, resigned to the facts of life, pleasures brief and fleeting, andthe best thing to do: put self aside and serve while one can.THE ANSWERMy babe must wait within the shadows whereBurn souls unborn, dim points of amber flame.He cannot hear my voice; he has no nameThat tongue can syllable upon the air;His home, alas, it is not here—nor there;And yet I know that unto me he came,A blessed spirit free from mortal blameAnd all the sorrow that the earth-born bear.I would not bring him to mortalityTo know Promethean pain. Why should he come(This sun-bright elfin of Eternity),The depths of all my misery to plumb?Better that ’twixt me and Desire’s hot wordStood Eden’s angel with the flaming sword.6 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt262]Sex magick with Jeanne on August 9 had no Object. “I forgot all abouteverything. This appears no accident; I had expected the Perfect Union on theseventh occasion; and behold it was so.” He felt her influence was preparing himfor the Grade of Magus. “It is very curious to notice how I am beingreconstructed in many inward ways . . . My shyness, too, is slowly wearing off.I think shortly all will be well.”7 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt263]One wonders if the Object of their ninth act of sex magick three days later camefrom Jeanne. It was “You.” Very romantic . . . Crowley’s cynicism turned in to asniff when he wrote it up. “This type of operation is unnecessary and frivolousin my opinion.” He added another cynical note, or was it a momentary note ofdawning realism?—“When she says ‘you’ she means ‘everything.’”8[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt264] He was nonetheless pleased to be showing her theropes and getting her over some of her inhibitions. “It was however a very greatsuccess. The elixir obtained with difficulty despite elaborate schooling duringthe day was of A1 quality.”August 15 was a Sunday, and Crowley and Jeanne went out to Long Island for aday’s bathing in very hot weather. Interestingly, he notes a “long quarrel aboutsex-magic at dinner.” One would love to have eavesdropped on that one! Jeannewas a Theosophist and would have understood that sex had a spiritual dimension,but it seems clear that IX° theory was alien to her romantic nature. For Jeanne,passion was a longing of the heart, not an orgy, and even with herRosicrucianist imagination it seems doubtful whether she would have been at easewith calling her vagina a cucurbit or thinking of her loved one as a HolyPhallos. But Crowley thought she’d “come through” the veil of respectability andfind in her true self the Scarlet Woman he dreamed of and prayed for, andthought he’d been granted.While the lovers splashed and swam and kissed and tried to let them-selves go atRockaway Beach, Sunday’s edition of the New York Tribune (August 15) unleashedthe whirlwind story leaked to the New York World. If Crowley found therevelations exciting, it didn’t impinge one whit on his magical life, whichreminds us that it is an error to see Crowley in this period only through theprism of his technical diaries.The first headline in two pages of reports could not have made worse reading forViereck and the Propaganda Kabinett, or their masters in Berlin.BERLIN ACCUSED OF STIRRING UP DISCORD IN USCharges include Fomenting Strikes and Subsidizing NewspapersThe story on pages 1 and 2 took off from Burke’s getting hold of Dr. Albert’sbriefcase, revealing secret undertakings performed by Count Johannvon Bernstorff, German ambassador to Washington; military attaché to theembassy, Captain Franz von Papen; Dr. Heinrich F. Albert, chief financial agentof the German government in the United States; Hugo Schweitzer, German Americanchemist; S. Sulzberger, Frankfort banker; Herr Waetzoldt, German traderepresentative; agents of the German Bureau of Information (Secret Service); andvarious other agents not officially identified, in the public view, with theGerman government. The weekly budget for German intrigues in America was said tobe $2 mil-lion. The Tribune revealed that documents showed the Germangovern-ment was “financial backer of the Fatherland,” the “pretenses of which tobe loyal to the American people are offset by vicious attacks on PresidentWilson.”U.S. authorities had discovered “a most elaborate scheme to control andinfluence the U.S. press, to establish newspapers and news services, financeprofessional lecturers and moving picture shows, and to enlist the support ofAmerican citizens and publish books for the sole purpose of fomenting internaldiscord among the American people to the advantage of the German Empire.” Acovert attempt to buy the American Press Association, keeping the appearance ofits existing head, had been uncovered. It was confirmed that the Germangovernment arranged with disloyal union leaders to foment strikes, as well as aplan to acquire a munitions firm to supply the Allies, with noguarantees/liabilities for nondelivery. Karl Boy-Ed took part in negotiations tofoment strikes at ammunition and car plants—$50,000 was allocated for thepurpose. Dr. Albert was named as “the general clearing agent of his governmentin the U.S.” There were also recruitment plans for covert acts. Albert had“taken over from Dernburg and Dr. Meyer-Gerhardt when they returned to Germany acouple of months ago.”One can barely imagine the pressure on Crowley at this point, knowing full wellthe main newspapers were not only sympathetic to the Allied cause but had causeto associate the Fatherland with subversion in America. It must have beensomething of a mild relief when his nonpolitical, witty article “A Hindu at thePolo Grounds” appeared in Vanity Fair that month. One can only wonder whatJeanne might have been going through as she must have known that Crowley waswriting anti-Allied material for the Germans while Crowley himself could notexplain to her what he was actually trying to achieve.Performing sex magick with Helen Westley on August 21 for “Hilarion’s Freedom,”freedom was defined as “freedom to carry out the Great Work without let orhindrance as she will. And her will is mine.”9 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt265]The frustrated lover seems to have been caviling at the limited amount of timeher professional commitments permitted her to be with him, for the “result”simply expresses relief. “I had given up all hope of seeing H[ilarion] today. At6:00 she suddenly ’phoned, and we drove together in Central Park for an hour anda half.” Whether Jeanne needed substantial breathing space from Crowley is not aquestion we can answer, but Crowley was trying, by his lights, to accommodateJeanne’s will so that it might eventually be fulfilled, and perfect freedom, ashe understood it, could be theirs.Late the following afternoon, after a warm, moist day with rain and thunder, theair cleared, and behind drawn blinds Crowley asked Jeanne to what Object theymight dedicate their love, or, if preferred, she could eschew any Object and“fall into the arms of God.” One might guess her choice. The ensuing operationwas “perfect in all points,” though “the Joy of these operations clouds theobservation.” Result: “As God wills.”Interestingly, given all the tension one perceives in the air, Jeanne suddenlyleft New York, without farewell or warning of any kind, the next day. Crowleyfell into almost uncontrollable panic, all but fainting in the office. Assailedby pangs of lover’s anxiety, he took refuge with Helen Westley, whose opinion ofall this drama is, sadly, unknown. So shaken was he by Hilarion’s suddenabsence, so intense was his fear of losing her, that he took as his Object“Faith in God.” Surely, surely, all would be well. He concentrated hard andturned a hot afternoon’s sex into a prayer. Crowley recorded a “great repose ofspirit” as the operation’s result. “The test will be whether the pangs returnbefore a reason-able interval has elapsed.”10 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt266]The next day faith developed into thanksgiving: he received a reassuringtelegram from Jeanne. It was the following day’s operation of Thanksgiving withHelen that was the genuine occasion of Crowley’s vision of “Pure Love” (August24), where, after offering “Thanks to God for Hilarion”—even if she did prove tobe false and had trampled on him, befooled and betrayed him—he awoke to “thefresh feeling of early boy-hood,” devoid of fear or attachment. It was, hewrote, “one of the big experiences of my life.”11[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt267]Before Jeanne finally returned to him on September 8, he had performed only twooperations with Helen Westley, the Object of the first being “Thanks be to Godfor his unspeakable gifts” and the second, nearly a fortnight later, “Praise andGlory to God.”The atmosphere was thunderous when Hilarion returned to her lover, the nighthot. The Object: “Thanksgiving to God and love toward him,” though the wordsused at the “consummation,” Crowley noted, came from the first line of histwentieth hymn to Hilarion.LOVE IS ONEI love God only when I love thee most.Censing the altar with the whispered showerOf worship, I approach the holiest hourWhen in the monstrance burns the blessed Host.Landed on life’s chryselephantine coast,*105 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft105]I make the godly gesture of pure power.The silence shrouds me like a folded flowerWhen all life lapses in the Holy Ghost.How could I love God if I loved not thee,Or love thee if I were not lost in God?Could there be three unless those Three were One?There is no shore to the celestial sea;There is no pylon to the last abode,The temple of our truth, Hilarion!12 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt268]The Elixir, Crowley observed, “was of surpassing quality, though obtainedsurreptitiously, owing to the reluctance of the Soror.”13[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt269] Jeanne and A’s love swoon continued intoSeptember, with hot days, warm nights, and joyous trips out swimming. Theydiscussed going together on a trip to Alaska and tried hard to conceive, thoughCrowley seemed unaware that conception is exceedingly unlikely duringmenstruation.Nevertheless, Crowley had never experienced lovemaking like it in his life.There was a purity about their relations reflected in the exalted Objects of theacts, such as, on September 19: “The main idea [is] to trust the future to theAll-Father.” They were clearly trying to find a common language of spiritualdiscourse. That operation was “supremely good” but followed by what he called inhis Rex de Arte Regia: a “Note on Human Nature.”Here I am enjoying freely the most beautiful and voluptuous woman I have everknown. In addition, she delights me immeasurably in every way, and inspires meconstantly to write poetry. She is one with me, more-over, in Spirit. And I amlosing sleep wondering (a) whether she loves me (b) whether she enjoys sexualintercourse and (c) whether she has ever had another lover. If she were a simplewhore I should be perfectly happy. I need medical care.14[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt270]He probably did. If he did not doubt Jeanne’s promise to be his wife, why wouldhe perform Opus CVI on September 21, whose Object was “This woman for my wife”?The night before he had had the following bizarre dream. “The previous nightH[ilarion] came to me. She was Titan—covered a furlong at least. Her mouth andvulva were blazing scarlet squares, and I performed this IX° fully. Yet I wasmore than half awake, and there was no physical emission of semen. This I call ahighly magical experience.”On the whole, Crowley was amazed at what he called the “simple piety” of theoperations with Jeanne. The twenty-second rite celebrated together, for example,had as its Object as “Thanksgiving to the Father, the Lover of All, for the loveof this woman.” He felt he had inherited a “new Kingdom,” though by October 3,three days before leaving New York with Jeanne (and Matlack Foster) for Chicago,he complained of “feeling myself too much led away.” He felt the “Holy Phallos”deserved the right to “assert its Omnipotence,” and giving as the Object of OpusXCI—with Odette Colcock,*106 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft106] “a rather flabbyand decayed French whore from Bordeaux; but expressive and fairlysensual”—“Power over Hilarion,” he declared, “Henceforward let her take herright place!”15 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt271]Oh dear! Jeanne wasn’t a feminist in the modern sense, but if thiswas a dominantline in Crowley’s thinking about her, he was asking for trouble. Nevertheless,this strain dominated only when Crowley felt most vulnerable. That is, it wasself-defense; in this case, because, as he noted in the record, “I had divinedrightly that H[ilarion] was avoiding me (through kindness for L[eila] W[addell]as it appeared later. So I was justified.” This seems to suggest that Jeanneknew of Crowley’s relationship with Leila Waddell and was giving her a chance!It’s difficult not to conclude that Jeanne Foster was as perturbed by Crowley’sfidelity, as he seems to have been about hers, for some time after Crowley addedto this record, “P.P.S. Christ what a bloody young ass I was. She was after someother stupid booby!” While this may refer to Leila, it makes more sense incontext if Crowley became aware that Jeanne had loving eyes for another, whichof course she did. One must presume that Crowley’s lifetime experience of thevision of “Pure Love” detached from all desire or object, while perfect at itslevel, was not his constant companion on Earth. Whether or not Crowley liked it,he was hook, line, and sinker in love with Jeanne Robert Foster and could feelforcefully that that gave her the power.She was some Scarlet Woman!"},{"pageContent":"EIGHTEENimage [images/9781620556313_099.jpg]The Way WestEarly evening, Wednesday, October 6, 1915, Crowley, Jeanne Robert Foster, andher elderly husband, Matlack Foster, passed beneath the great clock above GrandCentral Station’s sculpted facade, whose epic magnificence bestrode 42nd Streetand Lexington. The feel around the station would have reminded Crowley of Paris,for Grand Central was built in the graceful fin de siècle, Beaux-Arts,neoclassical style familiar to the Belle Époque, and in 1915 no surroundingedifice existed to diminish its grandeur.Having located the designated track, the curious trio boarded a New York CentralRailroad Pullman “sleeper” whose mighty steam locomotive puffed and hauled themovernight north up the Hudson Valley to Albany, then west through Buffalo on theU.S.–Canadian border and farther west, tracking Lake Erie’s north side toDetroit, Michigan, already home to the Ford Motor Company, the Dodge Brothers,Packard, Walter Chrysler, and William C. Durant—with all its industrialmodernity more than 560 miles from New York City. On the way, Crowley recordedtwo delightful acts of sex magick with Jeanne, first at 9:00 p.m. and then at6:00 a.m. Object: “Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gifts!” Jeanne’s husbandwas apparently in the dark about these rhythmic trysts.The Confessions gives Crowley’s reasons for the journey, plans for whichprobably started with talks with Jeanne about going to Alaska for a “honeymoon”to celebrate their “marriage” as spiritual sister, bride, brother, and husband.Crowley’s first stated motive was a desire to visit the 1915 World’s Fair in SanFrancisco, a city he hadn’t entered since 1900, before the earthquake; there wasa German exhibition at the fair. The second reason was to assess attitudestoward the war in the West and Midwest, especially among German-Americans.Viereck probably provided expenses, because the following week’s Fatherlandcover featured Viereck’s handwritten message, which read: “This is a Magazinefor hyphenated-Americans.” Research on German-American opinion was necessary,Crowley argued, to gauge the relative effects of American news coveragegenerally in relation to persuasive German propaganda: Whose message was gettingthrough to people of German descent? Clearly, by this ruse, there promisedexcellent opportunities for discerning useful intelligence, as Crowley says hehad significant introductions. Spence raises the possibility that he may alsohave already established contact with American Bureau of Investigationpersonnel, because the unabridged edition of Confessions mentions that theAmerican intelligence officers “had brains, and they used them,” contrasted withwhat Crowley considered lax attention to his potential shown by some figures inBritish intelligence. The comment, however, more likely applies to latercontacts, in or after 1916; evidence is sketchy.The day the party left New York, the Fatherland made its weekly appearance. Thatday’s issue included Crowley’s first article about the devastating effects ofGerman submarine warfare: the U-boats (Unterseeboot). Crowley was gaining steamfor an unadorned advocacy of “unrestricted” submarine warfare, an issue thateventually tipped the political scales and brought the United States into thewar, as was Crowley’s intention. His article “The Future of the Submarine”opened with horrible verses, to be read in a cod-German accent. It wassyndicated to the Eau Claire Leader, Wisconsin on October 5.Old England had a nafy;Dey had de fifteen-inch,So many und so long dey vasDey tink dey hav a cinch.De pootiest shells in all de vurld, Dey vayed ’pout two tausend pound; Und eferytime dat Vinston shpeakHe make der vurld resound.Old England had a nafy;I dells you it cost her dear;Dey plewed in more ash dvendy-vife Off millions efery year;Und vhenefer dey launch anofer ship Ed English gifes a cheer,I dinks dot so vine a nafyNefer sailed dis erdlich sphere.Old England had a nafy;Dey haf vun “Vistory,”Vun ‘Driumph,’ vun “Invincible,”Dot sailed upon der sea.Dey haf two hoondred “Dreadnought.” Und super-Dreadnoghts ash vell;But de bride of all der navyVos der prave “Unsinkable.”Old England had a nafy;Like fans der men vos rooty,Ven out of Luxhafen der comVun klein’ Unterseeboote.Und ven der nafy see him comeDey dink of der Chudgment Day.And ash qvick as dey can vot vos left of dem Vos sguttling out of der vay.Old England had a nafy,Vhere ish dot navy now?Vhere ish de lofely brazen cloud Dot vos on Vinston’s prow?Vhere ish de Mishtress of de seas Dot kept dem bottled tight?All goned away mit de torpedo—Avay in de evigkeit [eternity]!HANS BREITMAN IN 1915The twisted propaganda Crowley fashioned made no bones about the destruction ofBritish power (something none of the U.S. providers of money and credits toBritain could possibly relish). “When England blusteringly swore to starveGermany out, the reply was simple—the proclamation of a Reign of Terror. . . .It is easy to foresee that England will be crushed, if only that advantage bepressed home. . . . I see a submarine with a cruising radius of 5,000 miles, andenough torpedoes to blow every ship in the British navy out of the water . . .the day of island empires is over. . . . Let her [England] restore the oldworship; let her resume the pastoral and agricultural life; let her patriarchsexecute justice and mercy; well and good. But no more industrialism-slavery; nomore swindling oligarchy; no more smile-and-dagger diplomacy; no moregentleman-burglar world-power. The Unterseeboot has changed all that.”1[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt272] Crowley was pleased, but astonished, that theGermans would publish such nonsense, though he also intended the piece as awarning to Britain’s war planners: prepare for the worst. He was convinced thereasonable American would see it as unhinged, even as he insisted to his Germancolleagues that a stiffened-up approach would keep the Americans in suspenseabout German determination. He wondered to himself why Viereck & co did notrecognize that a British defeat would now be catastrophic for U.S. capital andwould be resisted. But then, the Germans strove for victory, regardless of whomit might upset in the end. Crowley tried to add folly to the logic of theirambition.The cover of that week’s issue may have precipitated an important question thatJeanne put to Crowley after one of their “unspeakable” rhythmic interludes. TheFatherland ’s cover indicated a new propaganda battlefront: munitions supply.Charles M. Schwab (1862–1939), president of the Bethlehem Steel and ShipbuildingCompany, had, as we saw earlier, visited Great Britain to facilitate supply ofmunitions. Frustrated by Secretary of State Bryan, Schwab managed to get aroundneutrality restrictions through exporting via Canada and became a major supplierof shells to British forces. During the Battle of the Somme in July 1916, Germanintelligence reported that well over 50 percent of 20 to 30 cm shells failed toexplode, leading, with other German intelligence coups, to a military disasterthat opened with a nightmare 57,000 British killed or injured on the battle’sfirst day. It was Germany’s plan to frustrate and degrade weapons production inAmerica. Schwab, for example, refused to have trades unions in his Pennsylvaniafactories, causing industrial unrest that the Germans secretly fomented.Sabotage of manufacture and supply was a major objective of German intelligence.The Fatherland cover showed a drawing of an American ammunition factory withworkers entering its walls. The headline read, AN AMERICAN FACTORY AND AMERICANNEUTRALITY, and quoted British war minister David Lloyd George that munitionsworkers were fighting as hard for Britain as was every man in the trenches. Thisclearly implied that an American munitions worker could contribute to Germanvictory as much as a German soldier in the trenches. Now hear Crowley’simportant reminiscence from the sleeping berth of the New York to Detroit trainof October 6, 1915.In the Autumn of 1915 I travelled to Detroit with Hilarion (Jeanne Foster). Weslept in the same berth. In a brief interval for discussion she—an American ofFrench extraction, asked me if I had to go into the trenches would I try to gointo the French or the German trenches. I confidently replied “Into the Germantrenches.” I would not trust her, she being on the private staff of Albert Shaw,on the Review of Reviews, who had been distinctly anti-English.2[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt273]What is even more interesting is a dream Crowley would have at their next stop,Chicago, to be related shortly. It shows Crowley already in contact with personsconcerned with German subversion of U.S. trades unions. The question remainingis whether Crowley was still a “lone hand” in his intelligence gathering, orwhether he was in secret contact with either, or both, British and Americansecret agencies.Alighting from the sleeper at Michigan Central Station, Detroit, on October 7,Crowley found himself dwarfed by an American architectural wonder: the tallesttrain station in the world. Only two years old, Detroit’s main station—designedby architects of New York Grand Central, Reed & Stem, and Warren & Whetmore—wasa staggeringly bold feature of Corktown, just under a mile southwest of downtownDetroit. A low classical facade with high arched windows like a grand Romanbathhouse, the lower building housed the marble concourse and track access.Looming ominously high behind it soared an awesomely modern (for its time)geo-metrically proportioned skyscraper of the kind we now associate withStalin’s monumental office structures in Moscow, but only because Stalin triedto emulate American architectural superconfidence; Stalin went over the top, butthe Americans got it right.Similar confidence, though of a decidedly more utilitarian character, marked theimpressive, mostly six-story redbrick Parke Davis Pharmaceutical factory andresearch laboratory at River Place, Detroit, bounded by the internationalriverfront, McDougall and Wight Streets.*107 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft107]Crowley relates almost matter-of-factly his surprising visit there.3[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt274] He remarks on the consideration shown to him ashe was guided about the ultramodern automated, bulk-producing plant. Hisadmiration for all he saw shows that the anti-industrial rhetoric of hisFatherland article was just that.Crowley even had some tips for the masters of packaged dope. “They were kindenough to interest themselves in my researches in Anhalonium lewinii [peyote]and made me some special preparations on the lines indicated by my experiencewhich proved greatly superior to previous preparations.”4[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt275] One senses perhaps that had Crowley been able topursue this line, the “psychedelic revolution” might have taken placeconsiderably earlier than history records! The idea of ingesting peyote as apill gave Spence the idea that Crowley’s real purpose at Parke-Davis was tofurnish U.S. intelligence operatives with a means to drug suspects, either forpurposes of deliberate disorientation or for interrogation.5[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt276] Accounts from intelligence records ofdisorientated suspects prevented from subverting U.S. factories and committingsabotage illustrate Spence’s interesting, yet unproven, speculation.The question is how did Crowley gain privileged access to the plant, and, insuch a short time, how might he have gotten staff authorized to createeffectively a new product? It is not like Parke-Davis had no “form” in thisarea, of course. They had pioneered a range of products using cocaine to perk upworker performance and provide alternatives to food! Before unlicensed cocaineuse was criminalized in December 1914, such activities were normal forpharmaceutical suppliers of pharmacies, and even drug stores. Nevertheless, thecommercial advantages of a peyote tab-let would require some justification in1915! Crowley must have obtained a blue-chip introduction from someone, unlesshe used his journalistic experience alone to access the plant. Crowley offers nofurther illumination on the subject, and the mystery of Crowley’s activities onthis much interrupted journey to the West Coast leaves questions that, so far,only Spence’s extensive speculative narratives have tried to fill, themselvesbegging more questions than answers.Around October 9, Crowley caught the New York Central Railroad train 250 mileswest to Chicago. While the Windy City still stands on Lake Michigan, Illinois,what no longer stands is the Norman castellated glory of brick, granite, andbrownstone that was Chicago Grand Central Station, which, replete with slenderclock tower, used to occupy West Harrison Street before thoughtful demolition in1971 denied posterity the pleasure of it.Emerging from interior marble beneath one of the three great arches that used tospan its lower facade, the party doubtless hailed a cab to remove them to theirhotel. Chicago’s streets in 1915 still had a fair amount of horse-drawn traffic,clip-clopping in from out of town and weaving among the cabs, electricstreetcars, and roadsters that filled the city’s dense, vertical streets.Industry was expanding rapidly, and there was intensive migration from the southof African Americans fleeing poverty and prejudice, looking for work and a newlife. Crowley did not like the feel of the place. “It gives the impression ofbeing a pure machine. Its artistic and cultural side shares the deadness of therest. It compares with New York rather as Manchester with London.”6[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt670] Had Crowley come just a few years later, hecould have witnessed the “Chicago Black Renaissance,” which would surely haveinterested him as a creative symptom of the New Aeon, which he would soon beheralding in earnest.In the event, Paul Carus escorted Crowley about the city. Resident pro-Germanpublisher and aficionado of ancient religion, Carus had published Crowley’s “TheNew Parsifal” and was, according to Crowley, “a big-hearted, simple-mindedcreature, with a certain childlike vision, by the light of which he judged theexternal world, a little like the White Knight in Alice!”7[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt671]As Spence has indicated, Carus had friends in German subversion—friends likeBerlin’s local consul von Reiswitz, recently apprised of Russian secret serviceOkhrana’s uncovering a plot to mobilize anarchists against the tsar’s militaryrepresentatives and impede Allied munitions delivery. Chicago and San Franciscowere recruiting centers for anarchist subversion. Among suspected anarchistswere “Red Emma” Goldman and lover and comrade Alexander Berkman, both associatesof the I.W.W. (Industrial Workers of the World) socialist-anarchist organization(see here [9781620556313_c07.xhtml#p135]).The Chicago Daily News archive has a photograph of Carus’s friend GustavKonstantin von Alvensleben with a note of December 6, 1915, reading: “Reputed tobe head of espionage” in Chicago. Seeing Chicago as a money-laundering base fora secret war planned in the spring with agents Rintelen von Kleist and WestCoast saboteur Kurt Jahnke, “Alvo” had recently crossed from Vancouver to meetvon Papen in Seattle. Forced to leave valuables near Vancouver, Spencespeculates that Crowley, who was heading there, retrieved it across the borderfor Alvo as a “favor.”8 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt672]Crowley gives very few details of his political activities in Confessions,hinting at them, often in a characteristically, sometimes annoyingly blasémanner. He confines his comments to cultural observations, usually critical. “Icalled [in Chicago] on Narnet Munroe, described in the charge sheet as apoetess. She edits a periodical called Poetry. . . . Chicago is the forlornoutpost of civilized man. Every mile beyond marks a lower rung on the ladder ofevolution.”9 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt277]Meanwhile, poor Matlack Foster’s presence pressed urgency into Jeanne’s desire,as she expressed it to Crowley, to come into “the sunlight.” Crowley had acrusading will to free women from unwanted marriages traceable since teenagedays in Eastbourne; that general will was intensified by peronal feelings. On awarm afternoon (October 11), possibly in a Chicago hotel, Crowley experiencedincomparable bliss with Jeanne—“a quite new experience”—“pure pleasure broughtto its uttermost softness and sweet-ness.” The Object: “To be always with thiswoman without obstacle”—Matlack Foster being the salient obstacle.At 1:05 a.m. the following morning, Crowley came out of a dream. Its contents hewrote up into a commonplace book, addressed to Jeanne. She kept it to the end ofher days; it is now in the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center, Texas. Ithappened to be the small hours of Crowley’s fortieth birthday, the day he feltthat he assumed the Grade of Magus 9° = 2▫.You have awakened my virility, Hilarion, to the full; a wonderful and seriousevent.I am just come out of a dream. I was supposed to be in the country somewhereproving an alibi, and had stolen up to town for an evening. There were Harré,Raynes, somebody I’ve forgotten who lived with Harré, and one or two others.There was you also, but your name was Miss Lelang or Lalaing, and you were astudent artist. I think you had gone home early. Anyhow, I too went, not verylate, after certain manoeuvres. (? There was some girl there with whom I wantedto be alone, but I can’t remember who, how, or why?)In any case, I found myself on a grassy hill, which was the west side of theButte Montmartre, and also a University, and I had to walk round to the southside to get to 56th St. where you lived. For I wished to make a last effort tosee you. But I only decided this because I went to sleep “for a moment” on thegrass and waking found it was 9:30 a.m. (I wondered why it was so light. Thegirls were going to market and students to the University and so on.) I had onby this time my blue and gold magic robe, and my C[ambridge] U[niversity]academicals, which I put on over the robe to hide it.At your home the landlady swore you had gone; but I refused to believe it sosilently and so forcefully that she suddenly changed her mind, took me upstairs,and knocked. You flung the door open. You had a loose nightdress on, and yourhair was down. Your first impulse was to shut the door, but you were afraid (Ithink) and I have little chance for I came in with determination.On the bed sat Sidney Carlisle (Doris’ [Gomez] worm husband) with some thinbrown sack-like thing on; under it I could see an enormous F[phallus] inerection—at least 18 inches long. Behind the door Neuburg, or Lapère, or amixture of the two, was squatting on the floor.It was of course evident that you were the last word in horror. I said “Allright; I accept the situation, and I love you; and now I can do it withoutscruple or diffidence.” I caught you in my arms, and we began to dancevoluptuously, madly, our mouths locked. S. C. [Carlisle] used his F as a violin,with some curious object (I can’t remember exactly what) as a bow, while Neuburgchanted a mantra. The dance got madder and faster.Bye and Bye I threw you down tempestuously on the bed B [reference to a drawingof the room], and thrust my head where it is happiest. Then after awhile I cameup and began to make love to you in the usual way.I woke, finding myself about to end, and believing the dream to be true. Withhorror: yet I summoned all my strength to cry “Thank God for Hilarion” and itthen seemed to me that the dream was not evidence, that she was in a railroadcar two hundred miles away, but that she had taken this way of coming to me towake me on my birthday!10 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt278]Apart from the suggestion that Jeanne and her husband may have gone on aheadwithout Crowley to Vancouver (where we know Crowley and Jeanne were nexttogether), two names mentioned in the dream show us again how tantalizinglylittle we know of what precisely Crowley had actually been up to in pursuance ofhis various schemes.The dreamed “Harré” is almost certainly dime novelist T. Everett Harré(1884–1948)11 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt279] who released a booklet in 1918 toalert America to “the enemy within”: I.W.W., an Auxiliary of the GermanEspionage System: History of the I.W.W. Anti-war Activities, Showing How theI.W.W. Program of Sabotage Inspired the Kaiser’s Agents in America.Founded in 1905, the I.W.W. (Industrial Workers of the World) advocatedrevolutionary industrial unionism supported by socialist-anarchist groups. InLondon in 1913, Crowley heard radical Irish trades unionist Jim Larkin, whowould join forces with the I.W.W. in America (see here[9781620556313_c08.xhtml#p159]). Between 1915 and 1917, the I.W.W.’s“Agricultural Workers Organization” (AWO) organized more than a hundred thousandmigratory farmworkers throughout the Midwest and western United States,recruiting members in rail yards and hobo haunts. This resulted in I.W.W.members being identified with hobos riding the rails and migratory farmworkersstruggling to get to the next jobsite: the meat-and-potatoes experiences thatinspired later “beat poets” and folksingers, such as Bob Dylan.I.W.W. intrigues with agricultural labor provide the context for Crowley’sremarkable claim that “I was fortunately able to break up a most formidable spysystem, disguised as the ‘Agricultural Labor Bureau.’”*108[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft108]12 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt280]The “Raynes” of Crowley’s Chicago dream is undoubtedly Maitland AmbroseTrevelyan Raynes (1879–1944), model for “Keynes Aloysius Wimble” in Crowley’sSimon Iff adventure What’s in a Name? whom we encountered in chapter 11 (pp.194–95) in fictional form, meeting Iff (Crowley?) off his ship at New York’sCunard Pier in October 1914. As noted then, Raynes may have been a British agentor intelligence asset.13 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt281]At 4:15 p.m. on the afternoon of his fortieth birthday, Crowley fell asleep inthe passenger car taking him some 300 miles northwest of Chicago to Minnesotacapital St. Paul, on the Mississippi’s eastern bank. He dreamed of Hilarion, hisvery own obsession. Awaking, he felt impelled suddenly to tear off the seal fromthe magick ring made for the grade of “Master of the Temple” 8° = 3▫. He thennoted boldly in Greek letters EΓΩ ΛΟΓΟΣ AIΩNΟΣ 9° = 2▫ Aimage[images/dots.jpg]Aimage [images/dots.jpg]—“I am the Word of the Aeon.” He wasthe Magus, and his “Word” was Thelema. He was now to identify himself whollywith that Word. He took as the omen of the moment a line from his Aimage[images/dots.jpg]Aimage [images/dots.jpg] Order collection ΘEΛHMA (“Thelema”):“Therefore is the seal unloosed, that guarded the Eighth Abyss; therefore is thevast sea as a veil; therefore is there a rendering asunder of all things.” Onewonders what the Roman Catholic bishop of the grandly imposing, domed St. Paul’sCathedral of St. Paul would have thought about that. Crowley could hardly haveavoided noting its almost anachronistic dominance of the otherwise thoroughlycommercialized capital.It is likely that Crowley stayed at the stately thirteen-story Hotel St. Paul onWest 5th Street. When he got there he realized he had lost the lapis lazuli,engraved with the V.V.V.V.V. motto and “Eye” from his platinum-lidded seal ring,itself studded with pyramids to represent the city where dwelled the Master ofthe Temple. Next morning at 10:00 a.m., Crowley returned to makeshift facilitiesinside a crowded warehouse on East 4th Street that served as a temporary stationfor the two hundred daily trains. The once impressive, now blackened and partlydemolished old Union Depot of 1881 had burned down two years previously;citizens were anxious for its replacement. Close to the rubble of the old,Crowley found the lapis lazuli on the platform in seven pieces. The figure sevenhe found spiritually significant. He put the pieces, in a packet, into histraveling safe, intended for distribution to seven representatives after hisdeath. A year later he checked for them; they were gone. Crowley associated suchunaccountable losses with a kind of payment to, or sign from, inscrutable lordsof destiny.With thoughts of that nature occupying his mind, it is little wonder that hefound St. Paul and Minneapolis “merely magnified markets always open” with “nolife of any kind outside business.” He imagined the populus as “poor damnedsouls” sweating to find a way out “somehow, somewhere.”14[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt282] He could barely understand how people could livesuch closed lives when all about them the elemental grandeur of nature cried outfor celebration and spiritual participation. People’s religion went on withinterminable proscriptions and moralizing inside European-style buildings,unrelated to the divine creation about them. The cities were colonies, alien andimposed on an environment that had sent its denizens into themselves,concentrated only on business at hand.What business had Crowley at hand? He maintained to Viereck that hisinvestigation of “hyphenated Americans” and nonhyphenated Americans revealed tohim that the Midwest had no interest in the war and could not see it hadanything to do with them (oblivious to their economic relationship to thecoasts), while German-Americans, he lied, were ready for insurrection and civilwar at the right signal. In fact he found non-German-Americans generally againstthe German cause but unwilling to consider doing anything about it, whileGerman-Americans were generally not roused to assisting their old homeland’sstruggle with the world. It should all be left to Europeans to sought out ontheir own territories. As John Butler Yeats would observe in 1916, Americanswould never vote for war, though they might be plunged into it.In himself, Crowley longed to get through the Rockies where “there was asemblance of resurrection,” for being in touch with the Pacific archipelago andAsia, the West Coast had “caught a little of their culture.”15[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt283]VANCOUVERBetween Wednesday the thirteenth and Saturday the sixteenth of October, Crowleycovered the two thousand or so miles of railroad between St. Paul and Vancouverin British Columbia, rumbling on west through what he considered a culturalvacuum in North Dakota and Montana toward Washington State and the Canadianborder, during which period British readers heard of the execution by firingsquad in Belgium of nurse Edith Cavell, an event that stirred Crowley to pen oneof his most savage propaganda articles (published in the International inJanuary 1916) in the hope that its sickening arrogance would turn off Americans.The ostensible reason for Crowley’s arrival in the neat, spacious,colonial-style, coastal city of Vancouver was to inspect new recruits to thecity’s O.T.O. lodge, led by his North American viceroy Charles Stansfeld Jones,assisted by fellow Englishman Wilfred T. Smith.16[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt284] News of Crowley’s coming had stimulated palpableanticipation among the fifteen or so members. They were to greet their VeryIllustrious Brother Sovereign Grand Inspector VII° under the assumed name of“Clifford” as he was involved in “a matter touching the welfare of theEmpire.”17 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt285]It may be that Jeanne Foster did not meet up with Crowley until the nineteenth,for she does not appear to have been present when Crowley’s train came in at thestill-under-construction (and now sadly demolished) Great Northern VancouverStation at 9:25 a.m. on the Saturday morning. V.I. Bro “Clifford” in a grayovercoat with Malacca cane (was he still suffering from the previous year’sphlebitis?) greeted Jones at the station, then, wasting no time, spent all daywith Jones, talking O.T.O. and Aimage [images/dots.jpg]Aimage [images/dots.jpg]business nonstop at Crowley’s billet, the massive chateaulike,eighteen-story-high Hotel Vancouver on Howe Street. Now gone forever, we mayimagine in another time, Crowley in his suite there, testing Jones on astralprojection. Crowley himself had been testing his own skills. Around mid-night onthe twelfth he had visited Hilarion astrally, as a golden snake that turned intoa great “Rood Cross” within her body “for many hours.” She in turn visited himvia the same channels on October 18, around lunchtime, and knew that she had(for I’m informed that an astral body might loosen off from its source byitself).18 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt286]At 4:30 p.m. on the Saturday, Crowley was briefly introduced to the awe-struckSmith. Smith regretted not putting more feeling into his hand-shake, but he hadnot recognized Crowley “on the instant.” Was “Clifford” sporting additionaldisguise, or was Crowley in his “invisible” mode? After all, the Fatherland wasa proscribed magazine under Canadian Special Measures legislation, and lodgemembers were instructed to maintain silence about the inspector general’swhereabouts.19 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt287] It may be that Smith entertaineda visual ideal of Crowley of his own imagining and wasn’t ready for theincarnate being.The following Tuesday, Very Excellent Soror Hilarion and Very Illustrious BroClifford were expected to inspect the lodge. Before doing so, they met up in theprofoundest sense in the Hotel Vancouver at 5:30 p.m. for an Object Crowleynoted as “Thanksgiving for my sister and bride, Hilarion.” No other ScarletWoman would ever again extract this much thanksgiving from Crowley’s amorousheart.British Columbia Lodge Number 1 was duly assembled at an old Chesterfieldschoolhouse at 1532 Lonsdale Avenue, across the “First Narrows” in NorthVancouver, which also provided a home for Jones and his family.*109[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft109] Crowley and Jeanne observed the initiation intothe Minerval and 1° of Smith’s candidate Reginald W. Shaw, and Crowley’srecommendation Horace Algernon Sheridan-Bickers (1883–1957). Sheridan-Bickers,whom Crowley had known as painter and dramatist in prewar London (he was born inBalham), would go on to screenwrite in Hollywood, while Betty, his wife (notpresent at the inspection), had already earned Crowley’s attention.Crowley gave a brief congratulatory speech. He was impressed by the ritualperformance and by the well-made furniture and ornaments. Minutes recount thatSoror Hilarion also offered her appreciation of the evening’s events.Jones offered his hospitality for the night, but Crowley had to refuse, writing,“your lodge, beautiful as it is, has not got a Red Room; and I had to hold somechapters.”20 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt288] Unwitting Rose-Croix Knight-Masonsmight imagine that Crowley was referring to the “perfection” chamber of the18° Rose-Croix grade of the Ancient & Accepted Rite. But the “Red Room of theRose-Croix” had to do with the mystic rood and the mystic rose, and thesecomponents came together for the twenty-eighth occasion “to the glory of God” onOctober 20 at 1:10 p.m. in Vancouver, British Columbia. According to notes inthe Rex de Arte Regia record made three days later, the rite was unfortunately“done without proper O.T.O. devotion, in fact it was perfectly human.” It seemsCrowley simply made love to Jeanne, such was his impatient, frustratedexcitement at having occasional congress with the “wife” of all he owned who wasnipping off at intervals with her husband. The results of this magical faux paswere, he wrote, “disastrous”: “(1) No opportunity [presumably for seeing Jeanne](2) mental disturbance and irritation all last night.”21[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt289]Thursday, October 1, marked the last occasion Smith would ever see his masteragain, but he struggled on and remained an active devotee for life; indeed,without W. T. Smith (1885–1957) it is hard to imagine the O.T.O.’s surviving andultimately growing in America to this day. Smith wrote:Brother Clifford, A.E.C., Baphomet [Crowley’s O.T.O. title as Head of theBritish Order], has left Vancouver told for Victoria. But I am inclined to thinksomewhere else, first at least. One can certainly feel him even so thick aperson as myself. Should like to have had a bit of a talk to him. However it washardly worth his while to bother with such a beginner. I have not made muchshowing. May come in for a little more of his attention another time. Iunderstand he is very busy on important business with the war.22[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt290]There was a Southern Pacific steamer connection westward across the waters ofthe Inside Passage, then south to Victoria, at the southernmost tip of VancouverIsland. Spence, however, perhaps taking a tip from Smith’s doubting that Crowleywould head straight there, suggests that Crowley got off the ferry at the miningtown of Nanaimo, sixty miles north of Victoria, also on a very chilly VancouverIsland. Alvo von Alvensleben, “reputed head” of Chicago espionage, had lived atPort Alberni, less than forty miles west of Nanaimo, and Crowley couldapparently do what Alvo could not: cross the border with valuables. Even if thisimaginative hypothesis were true, it is very unlikely Smith would have doubtedCrowley’s intention to go straight to Victoria for such a purpose. Anotherpossibility may explain Smith’s doubt. Near the Victoria end of theVictoria–Nanaimo rail line nestled the village of Shawnigan. Shawnigan Lake washome to Sheridan-Bickers and wife, Margaret (“Betty”), who had not come to theO.T.O. meeting. As Crowley had enjoyed a brief affair with her before the war inLondon, perhaps a friendly reunion with her was what sex-conscious Smith wasthinking about.Londraville’s biography of Jeanne Foster refers to a diary entry of hers from1915, placed at Victoria in “September.” The date must be an error as Jeanne wasback East that month—Night—Moonlight onWater black?Lying hills—A.Beneath that, two words: White nights. An entry follows that positively shoutsout Jeanne’s confusion, and her determination to overcome it, over sex and love,and in references to the “Holy Guardian Angel” shows how intently she had beenlistening to Crowley’s vision of spiritual existence.Oh the vanity of vanities that is called love. Oh the worms that creep in theflesh and the venom that lurks in the blood. The sacrifice . . . the spirit-madseeker—how desperately must they strive against this most potent spell, thisprincely hallucination. It is a fever which runs its course—a disease thatrenders the victim weaker after each successive attack.To love God—and God alone—to be consumed with His passion and His glory—to knowthe companionship of the Holy Guardian Angel, this is the only love that is notprofanation and abomination.Deliver me from the snare of the flesh. Deliver me from its sharp delights.Deliver me from its lures and its tender secrets.If it be in God’s will that I shall find the love of God mirrored in a humanbeing and that he loving God shall be God mirrored in me—then verily—holily wemay love and even fearfully . . . love each other and forget God.23[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt291]Crowley related in his Confessions that he took a ship from Victoria to Seattle.By October 25 he was at Portland, Oregon, some 125 miles south of Seattle byGreat Northern Railroad. There he again found himself with Jeanne. Matters withMatlack Foster were fast coming to a head. Crowley looked at the situationastrologically and, with Mars, Uranus, and Saturn in Jeanne’s seventh house,concluded that it looked “like destruction to the husband.” The Object of thesex magick was unequivocal: “Hilarion’s Freedom. This is meant in a final sense;I had been thinking of nothing else for two days or more. I invoked all powersto aid. The Operation was excellent—for the first time (in 137 days) we foundourselves in a bed!”24 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt292]On that day Crowley made a serious entry in the “Royal Art” record.It is now evident in all ways that I am indeed ΘHPIΟN (Therion = “Wild Beast”)Magus 9° = 2▫ Aimage [images/dots.jpg]Aimage [images/dots.jpg] This is to beproclaimed openly.

Crowleyhad just missed the earthquake in 1906, and since then much of the city had beenrebuilt at lightning speed, such was the grit and confidence of the Californianswho had made a golden gate to Asia and South America, backed to the hilt withmoney from Amy Crocker’s hugely wealthy banker relatives. Having secured half acontinent for trade and settlement by railroad, they weren’t going to let anearthquake get in the way. And now San Francisco’s great show year had arrived.While the Allies faced long, painful casualty lists, bogged down on theceaselessly bloody western and eastern fronts in a war unlike any other known tothe species, San Francisco hosted the truly magnificent, incomparablyspectacular Panama-Pacific International Exposition.Opened on February 20 on a breathtaking 630-acre site in the Marina District,gilded souvenir booklets showed a fantasy scene of rainbow rays emanating from apharos to rival ancient Alexandria’s, speckled with golden light and crystalwaters at night. The artificial city’s domes, towers, cupolas, and pillaredhalls matched any wonderland ever conceived and exceeded most, and even thoughmost of that splendor was wood and plaster and papier-mâché at its mostgloriously sophisticated, there was no doubt that what was known generally asthe World’s Fair was a dream made real, a vision of a future without “futurism,”if only for one magical year.image [images/9781620556313_043.jpg]Fig. 19.1.

The Machinery Building, Panama-California Exposition, San Diego, 1915Now it is more than a century past, and in 2015 San Francisco residents wonderedwhy there was a giant “1915” neon display lighting the heights of the FerryBuilding. What did those numbers mean? The only thing left of the greatest fairin the world is the refitted Palace of Fine Arts, still echoing Quo Vadisgrandeur by a fountain at 3301 Lyon Street, with its colonnade and Pantheon-likerotunda. Gone are the Netherlands Pavilion, the Palace of Horticulture “matchedby no marvel save in eastern scene” (now an apartment block on Divisadero andChestnut Streets), the Palace of Transportation—like the walls of Byzantium andHagia Sophia combined (replaced by a row of houses on Marina Boulevard and ScottStreets), while the once-throbbing Amusement Zone and Dayton Flood exhibition istoday a playing field. The Machinery Palace on Filmore Street—all gone; theCourt of Sun and Stars, a vision to rival Vatican City, “left not a rackbehind”; the nine great arches of the Service Building, “baseless fabric”; theLiberal Arts Palace and Tower, not even a memory. Where once the State ofWashington Pavilion stood in stately harmony, the Crissy Field Marsh has floodedthe site. Nobody could ever imagine that a towering Buddha of gigantic,superhuman pro-portions once sat in tranquil asana above what is now Gough andBay Streets: in 1915 it was the “Japanese Village.”image [images/9781620556313_046.jpg]Fig. 19.4. Festival Hall, Panama-Pacific International Exposition, 1915Well, the revels had not yet ended when Crowley and the Fosters arrived inOctober 1915. Crowley had nothing to say about the World’s Fair—ostensiblereason for his journey west—and would doubtless have resorted to Prosperos’sspeech regarding the life-dream’s “insubstantial pageant” from The Tempest, as Ihave done, had he done so.Since my last visit San Francisco had been rebuilt. The old charm had vanishedcompletely. It had become a regular fellow. The earthquake had swallowed upromance, and the fire burnt up the soul of the city to ashes. The phoenix hadperished and from the cinders had arisen a turkey buzzard.1[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt293]He may have been thinking about his hotel. Booked into the Palace Hotel, atwhich site he had stayed in 1901, the hotel had changed. Reduced to a burned-outshell in the fire that followed the 1906 earthquake, the “new” Palace Hotel hadrisen from its ashes in 1909 on the corner of Market Street and new MontgomeryStreet. This had always been the hotel for “anybody who was anybody,” and whileits interior was as sumptuous as its predecessor, its exterior, though ofsimilar proportions to the original, was noticeably plainer.image [images/9781620556313_047.jpg]Fig. 19.5. Market Street, San Francisco, 1915, taken to promote the exposition(note the “1915” top-center)A stroll down Market Street would still have focused on the Ferry Building clocktower at the bay end (now with an electrically enhanced giant 1915 emblazoningits crown), and there were still horse-drawn milk carts obstructing automobilesas they wove about over the tramcar tracks, but some of the old grandeur andvariety had necessarily gone as buildings appeared close together from the sametemporally compressed mind-set, while ugly spaces signaled what had been lostamid Mother Nature’s violent indifference to concrete civilization.From the Palace Hotel, Crowley wrote to John Quinn on October 31 offering atypically acerbic view on the exhibition, as well as some comments on art, as isdiscernible from Quinn’s interesting and genial reply below, posted to thePalace Hotel on November 22 but returned to Quinn in New York, as Crowley had bythen left the hotel.My dear Crowley,I am glad to hear from you. I enjoyed reading your letter of the 31st. I thinkyou are right about the exhibition. I never saw but one and that was the one inBuffalo. I avoided the “great” Chicago exhibition of 1893 and the St Louisexhibition of 1900. They are a weariness of the flesh and a discouragement ofthe soul.I agree with you about art largely, but I can’t agree that “beauty is a sideproduct”. An artist must have something to say and then must know how to say it.I can’t stand Mathew Arnold’s theory of poetry, but it isn’t so irritating to meas the theory of Stopford Brooke and the Dowden school, who are always claimingthat “to be a great poet one must be a great and good man”. It is of course damnnonsense. The goodness or the greatness of the poet or artist hasn’t a damnthing to do with his technique or emotion. I have known good men who either wereno poets or rotten poets and there are many great poets who must have beenrotten men from the Stopford Brooke and Edward Dowden point of view. Catullus,for example, and Villon and Verlaine. The thing is that a poet or an artist mustknow his trade, must be the master of the technique of his art, and then he mustbe profoundly moved, and then there may be fine art and if the theme is great itmay be great art.Whistler did many pleasant things but he wasn’t a great artist. One feelsconstantly that he was a Western reflection of the Japanese.I have never been in San Francisco. They used to be proud of their Bohemia. I amtold that the big trees and the Yosemite are disappointing but that the GrandCanyon of the Colorado is really superb.There is nothing new here. This damn stupid war has almost killed art and ishard on writers, sculptors, painters and other artists. Ar present Germany is ontop. I fear she will remain on top. France is the one bright spot. A nation thatwas supposed to be hysterical and decadent has shown itself to be much lesshysterical than the English and the Germans and man to man as efficient as theGermans and has earned its right to live for a thousand years.We probably have entered upon a greater era of conquest than the Napoleonic era,and the things that we are witnessing may change the face of the world for athousand years. The stupidity of the English, soldiers, diplomats, Cabinet andall can best be illustrated by the way Greece has fooled them. They say Englandhas made three separate loans to the Greeks. Why, God damn it, the thirdassistant clerk in the foreign exchange department in any first class New Yorkbank wouldn’t be deceived by the Greek Minister and Chargé D’Affaires or byseventy-five Greeks or by the whole Greek Cabinet, for fifteen minutes. Hesimply wouldn’t trust them. The third assistant clerk in any foreign exchangedepartment has some horse-sense. He perhaps didn’t go to Oxford or Cambridge orto Sandhurst and he would probably be a German or a Jew or a Frenchman.I hope this will find you less depressed than when you wrote your letter. Youmust have liked writing it for I enjoyed reading it.I don’t imagine your present journey will take you back into Mexico.*110[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft110] But wherever it takes you I hope you will have asatisfactory time.Sincerely yours,John Quinn2 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt294]It is perfectly clear from this letter and one that Quinn sent following it thatCrowley and Quinn shared cultural perceptions and humor, as well as politics,and that W. B. Yeats’s attempts to turn Quinn directly against Crowley wereresisted in practice. Realizing that Crowley had not received his last letter,Quinn wrote Crowley again on December 9, at 25 West 44th Street, where Crowleylived under the name “Cyril Grey,” the name he would give himself as a characterin his Simon Iff stories in 1917. Quinn wrote to him “c/o Cyril Grey,” whichsuggests that he was aware of the alias, and perhaps the reason for it. Theletter does not lack a wit Crowley would have savored, or an interestinginvitation.My dear Crowley,I just got back from Washington. I got your letter from San Francisco. At thattime I had a moment’s leisure and I answered it. My letter was returned from theSt Francis a few days ago. It is too stale now to send to you.I have been hellishly driven and busy and harassed and annoyed and irritated,till I have almost had murder in my heart and hell outside, and nearly all overpreventable and unnecessary irritations and stupidities. The big things in lifelike illness, worry over friends, and so on, one can stand without the quiver ofa nerve. But the other things, and the people who make all sorts of demands onone’s purse and person, they are the devils. I remarked this to a friend of minethe other day, and promptly came back a letter stating that he had two girls inhis office “either one of whom believes she could help me to successfullywithstand these assaults that I hourly endure”. Which I thought slightlyambiguous. I wonder if their willingness to help me to endure assaults meantthat they were willing to participate in assaults? And the man that wrote thatletter wasn’t a Greek either. But I follow the old maxim: “Beware of such offerseven when they come as a gift”. They are even more dangerous as a gift than as acommodity.Some time in the course of the next two or three weeks I am going to haveFrancis Grierson up to my place some night, and if you are here and free I shallwant to ask you.*111 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft111]I hope you had a pleasant trip in the west.Sincerely yours,John Quinn.3 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt295]Precisely what Crowley had hoped to accomplish in San Francisco is obscure. Hesays in his Confessions that on arriving he found himself “invited to address asemi-public gathering”—whatever that might have been.4[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt296] Identifying himself with his message he openedit with “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law,” the injunction forwhich the Beast will be most remembered. Spence sees a coincidence here. Germanconspirators in sabotage Franz Bopp and Wilhelm von Brincken also used thePalace Hotel.5 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt297]On October 27, a bright hot day, Crowley found himself behind lace curtains with“Juanita,” a “half-caste Mexican Indian prostitute; very nice, agreeable, andsensual.” Despite all his “sex feeling” being aimed at Hilarion, and despite itsbeing undertaken against his “human will,” the opus was done for “proper magicalreasons.” Object: “Magick Power. This has special reference to my wish todeclare myself, and master California.” Crowley gave as the result of the IX°rite, “I went to see one of my introductions, and I think made a very bigimpression. I was full of life and glow, and felt myself radiating force in alldirections.”6 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt298] An addendum of November 2 to thatresult says, “Everything looks as if this were going to work out A1.”Because Crowley made a point of distinguishing his San Francisco trip by hishaving proclaimed the Word of Thelema in himself in the Confessions, it seemslikely that the “introduction” where he radiated power was linked to the“semi-public meeting” mentioned there, and if we bear in mind his desire to meetbreakaway Theosophical Society head Katherine Tingley at Pont Loma, San Diego,just over a fortnight later, the introductions may more likely have been linkedto theosophical and/or occult fraternities (perhaps assisted by Paul Carus) thanGerman saboteurs. Besides, Crowley’s attempted espionage finds scant referencein his magical diaries; he kept the planes apart assiduously.Crowley was experiencing a moment of confidence in his assumption of the gradeof Magus, reflected in his notes after reuniting with Jeanne on October 30.Asking her for the Object, Jeanne said she wanted “Nothing,” so Crowley replied,“Let us offer up our happiness to God,” a rite distinguished by a technicalperformance “better than any yet accomplished.” Jeanne seemed to have got overher demure resistance. “The Elixir, now granted freely and with understanding,was super-excellent,” to which Crowley added in Greek, “Glory to God the OneOnly Phallos,”7 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt299] doubt-less inspired by theregular symbolic representation of the Hindu Shiva, who, should he open his eye,dissolves the universe (“Nothing”). This was sexual gnosis, familiar to theSethian Gnostics of late antiquity and resurrected from the ashes of his pastkarma by the Magus of Thelema.Jeanne conjoined with the Wild Beast again at the end of a hot day on November1. The Object, “Hilarion’s Freedom.” From his record it appears they contracteda marriage, recorded on the back page of the original notebook. Judging from theastrological portents, Crowley was temporarily reassured that it looked “as iffreedom would come through divorce, but without scandal.”8[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt300]Four days later, the situation had somehow changed dramatically. Crowley notedthe twelfth house of his “beloved wife and sister H” was “heavily afflicted.” Hedecided to take an “extreme course with the determination to bring permanentrelief.”9 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt301] His magical intention was plain: toinvoke the powers to rid Jeanne permanently of her husband, by such means toaccelerate any tendency in Matlack Foster that would lead naturally to hisdeath, and to remove any obstacle to Crowley’s formally marrying the ScarletWoman so to establish the New Aeon afresh, after the Beast’s disastrous firstmarriage. Unfortunately, we don’t know what Jeanne thought of this specificcourse of action, except that, according to Crowley, she repeatedly expresseddesperation to be free of her old man and had agreed to marry Crowley if it wasGod’s will. Nor do we know of the actual relations between the three of them orwhat might have taken place between Matlack, his wife, and her lover.10[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt302]At 2:12 a.m. in San Francisco on November 5, Crowley found himself with anotable—Crowley says “brilliant”—actress, French American Myriam Deroxe (“admits27 is about 35 at a guess”). Very dark, tall, strong, curvaceously hipped and“excessively sensual,” she was, he wrote, “an expert in every vice and addictedto every drug.” Surviving photos of her as Hermione in Andriomaque or asVendramine in Bianca Capello (The Theatre, 1910; 1912) echo Crowley’s findings.One doubts if she was aware of her latest role in Crowley and Jeanne’s familydrama, with a hint of “Clue” about it.The rite’s Object Crowley put in cipher: Θ . . . 40 . . . Φ. Given everythingelse in the context, the Greek theta almost certainly stands for thanatos,death; the 40 is the number of the Hebrew letter mem (M), and the Greek phistands for F: “Death . . . M. F.” M. F. is Matlack Foster. There are plenty moreclues. After “closing the temple” he went away at 3:15 a.m., continuing themantra Θ.Î\" . . . O.M.Φ. He then, employing goetic magic, invoked image[images/9781620556313_0103.jpg] (Hebrew letter tav, T or Th) by image[images/9781620556313_0104.jpg] (figure of seal of Solomon) “using the propernames, and that also of image [images/9781620556313_0106.jpg] [Hebrew aleph],the notorious angel appropriate.” That archangel was Azazel, Hebrew angel ofdeath. “This I repeated outside the apartment of the person indicated; and Ifurther invoked image [images/9781620556313_0105.jpg] [figure for Saturn] toprotect my beloved Hilarion.” Crowley and Deroxe inhaled ethyl ether (diethylether) and took cocaine. Plunging his ring into the Holy Book “Thelema,” hefound the words “a drop of the poison of eld,” so there can be little doubt asto what he was up to.image [images/9781620556313_048.jpg]Fig. 19.6. Myriam Deroxe, actress, modeling furs in 1911According to her diary, Jeanne spent the later part of that day with herhusband, observing, from a train presumably, “long ledges of rock running intothe sea from a forest of gnarled cypress and cedar. Wild crags, covered with seafowl, and lazy seals,”11 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt303] somewhere between SanFrancisco and Salinas.She does not mention that at the end of that day (November 5) she enjoyed asecret tryst with her lover who had headed south from San Francisco to SantaCruz, by the Bay of Monterey, to see the big trees and get close to the naturehe loved, wild and free. His account of their meeting outside the town limits isextremely romantic.I snatched a meal in the town and walked out in the gloaming. My sweetheart waswaiting for me in the dusk just beyond the town limits. “How glad I am you havecome,” she whispered. “Let us walk together to the grove. You shall sleep on mybosom all night, beneath the shadow of the giant sentinel whose spear pointssalute the stars.” My sweet-heart wove herself about me, an intoxicatingambience. Drunk with delight I strode through the silence. It must have beensheer luck that I found the grove, for one cannot see it from a distance, atleast on a dark night. But I walked straight to the clump and threw myself downdog-tired and happy beyond all whooping. I gazed awhile through the tangle ofbranches up to the stars. They closed. I slept. At dawn, I woke refreshed, hadbreakfast in a cabin hard by and wandered back to the railway. I had had aperfect holiday from the Spirit of America! The fresh morning air becamearticulate and whispered a sound in my ear.12 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt304]The sound became a poem about the experience, “At Big Trees, Santa Cruz,”composed while the Fosters headed south for Santa Barbara, about ninety milesnorth of Los Angeles. Jeanne’s diary comments innocently about ranches and farmsin the Salinas Valley and south of Monterey. On the seventh the Fosters were inSanta Barbara writing up the wonders of nature and the character of the townsshe and Matt had witnessed on their journey.We know from Crowley’s diary that the day following she was in Los Angeles, withthe Beast, for at 11:27 a.m. they performed their sexual rite in thanks toGod.13 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt305] Crowley thought little of the hub of themovie industry, dispatching it summarily, “having been warned against the cinemacrowd of cocaine-crazed sexual lunatics, and the swarming maggots ofnear-occultists.”14 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt306]Plus ça change, perhaps . . .Crowley retired briefly to the hills north of the city where, buoyant withsudden optimism, or needing an outlet for pent-up frustration, he ran tirelesslyfrom crest to crest, like Hermes carrying an urgent message from Olympus,composing poetry in praise of Hilarion while gazing up to the skies, and down onHollywoodland.D. W. Griffith, director of The Birth of a Nation, had been up to the SanFrancisco Exposition himself. So impressed was he by its Tower of Jewels that hewanted the Italian artisans who worked on it to rebuild Babylon, appropriately,on the corner of Hollywood and Sunset Boulevards. Most of the Italians hadalready returned to Italy, but three who remained found themselves in LosAngeles working on the epic movie Intolerance (released in 1916) in which thewickedness of Babylon was reincarnated on the most extravagant set ever seen inCalifornia. Surely Crowley had missed something here. One wonders who had warnedhim against the cinema crowd; he enjoyed much of it enough in later years, andit is reasonable to assume that his relations with Myriam Deroxe might qualifyin objective eyes for the somewhat hypocritical invective he leveled at thedream academy. For one who could tolerate practically everything, he was prettyintolerant himself. But, to give him credit, he was always willing to beenlightened and adapt his thoughts.Such would have to occur pretty soon with regard to Matlack Foster, for thingshad obviously got well out of hand. By November 10, Jeanne had moved south tojoin the throng that converged on San Diego’s competing Panama-CaliforniaExposition in a magically transformed Balboa Park. Like San Francisco’sexhibition, San Diego’s phenomenal Moorish-flavored site—resembling an extendedversion of William Randolph Hearst’s extravagant Pacific coast pile at SanSimeon between Monterey and Santa Barbara—was billed to celebrate the completionof the Panama Canal but was primarily intended as an advertisement forCalifornia’s confidence and as an open-door vision for the seaborneopportunities that San Diego’s magnificent harbor provided. Opened by PresidentWoodrow Wilson in January, Teddy Roosevelt and his wife had visited it in July.And if that wasn’t enough, Hollywood superstar Roscoe “Fatty” Arbuckle had beenmobbed with costar Mabel Normand too on their visit. The message was plain: SanDiego was open to the world, ready and willing to accommodate all shapes andsizes.image [images/9781620556313_049.jpg]Fig. 19.7. Bird’s-eye view of Panama-California Exposition, 1915, San DiegoJeanne was struck not only by its display of Mayan treasures but also by theWelfare Exhibit. Her later life would be distinguished by devoted service in thecause of public welfare, and the San Diego exhibit impressed on her again, afterexperiences in Ireland and elsewhere, how child labor destroys human happinessand corrupts society. One can only imagine, as she made her way about themassive site, Jeanne’s thoughts and emotions going through a maelstrom fromwhich established interests offered fleeting escape.On November 11, perhaps because Jeanne was a sometime Theosophist, Crowley askedher to deliver a letter of “Pure Love” he’d written to Katherine Tingley, whowith William Q. Judge had formed a breakaway society when Annie Besant took overthe TS. Crowley was at odds with Besant over her and her followers’ belief thatyoung Jiddu Krishnamurti was the “Coming One,” a new spiritual messiah for theworld, and Crowley expected his loving approach to be received gracefully byTingley at her Raja Yoga Academy and Temple of Peace at Point Loma, San Diego.Convinced that the TS needed what he, and only he, had got, Crowley dreamed ofan alliance, as he never stopped dreaming of becoming Annie Besant’s successor.Either before or after delivering the letter, Crowley and Jeanne performed OpusCXXIII with the same Object as Crowley’s rite with Myriam Deroxe:“well-conceived from the Goetic [daimonic] and Panic [of “Pan”] standpoint,considering the relation of H. to the person in question [M. Foster], and Herviews on ‘living in the sunlight.’ However, I don’t think it worked.”15[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt307] Clearly not.For some reason Crowley blamed himself for asking Jeanne to deliver the letterto Tingley. Perhaps she had found the experience upsetting for some reason, orhe regretted not bringing to bear on the Theosophists his “Magic Power.”Impatient, Crowley took himself to Tingley’s flower garden overlooking thePacific on the twelfth. There, one “Brown” brusquely seized Crowley’s greetingcard. The Magus, full of Pure Love, as he put it, was thrown off guard byBrown’s aggressive provocation. The Beast was not welcome. Waiting for hisautomobile lift, Crowley witnessed what he called their “soulless devilries forawhile”—perhaps outdoor yoga sessions whose spirit he discerned as inappropriateor anemically ill directed. As the light began to fade, a young man rushed outand took photographs of him, which Crowley thought “extraordinary.”There was a denouement. In the early hours of the next morning, Crowley dreamedhe was in a photographer’s attic where a beautiful boy of twenty kissed him,then seized his genitals so hard that Crowley awoke in pain. Wide awake, Crowleyrecorded seeing a “shapeless half-human being with a pig’s face” rise throughthe bed and bite his right breast while trying to copulate with him. He seizedit and, with desperate effort, strangled it, so he wrote, commenting, “Nothingof this sort has occurred since the summer of 1899 E.V. [era vulgari = commonera] when W. B. Yeats sent his vampires after me. I think it argues greatweakness in me as well as great strength in the Tingley witch.”Importantly his next comment (written on November 13) links the circumstance toOpus number CXXI with assistant Myriam Deroxe, where he had willed death onMatlack Foster: “I doubt almost whether Ops like CXXI are legitimate after all;whether indeed one should not ‘overcome evil with good’ in the world as well asin oneself.”16 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt308]Jeanne also, he noted, had “similar unpleasant experiences, having a weaselcoming to her.” Petting it, it bit her breast. She also got up in her sleep totelephone him, “not knowing it.” Such goings-on, imaginative perhaps, did notstop Crowley in his determination to “free” Jeanne from Foster. A note ofNovember 16 indicates that he met Jeanne’s husband and put a magical death-signon him, “astrally.” Also astrally came Hilarion to him that night around 11:00p.m., “naked, slightly larger than life.” In astral embrace his “Phallus”entered her, filling her entire body until their combined aura was “an egg offire-opal” giving off sparks of silver amid rainbow rays. He woke in the morningfeeling all the symptoms of a night of drink and debauchery.It would appear from the record that Jeanne and Crowley’s paths diverged againafter San Diego; they would not reconvene in the flesh until meeting at Chicagoon November 22. In the meantime, Crowley found relief among the brothels,gambling halls, and drinking saloons of “Tia Juanta” on the Mexican border,which must have brought back memories of leaving Mexico in the early summer of1901. He headed east toward Arizona’s Grand Canyon. Pondering its curiousgeology, Crowley decided that the prevailing theory of its being gouged out bywater erosion over vast periods of time was unlikely; he, thinking for himselfas ever, decided an earthquake had created an almighty crack that gave passageto the Colorado. Nimble-footed Crowley rushed down the “Angel Trail” indouble-quick time to the river, where he cried the name of Hilarion so thatNature might echo it resoundingly.Three days before seeing Jeanne again in Chicago, Crowley found himself inKansas City where he got “well done” by one Ruth “Hall,” German Americanprostitute (was she part of research?), excessively sensual, voluptuous, andeager, as he put it. She reminded him of London society hostess Gwen Otter. TheObject was death (in code) for Matlack Foster “for the third and last time!!!”He appears to have heard that Foster’s health was failing so he wrote, “PleaseGod this may finish the whole hellish business!”17[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt309]Meeting together in Chicago, opus CXXV, their thirty-fourth sexual encounter,was dedicated to “Thanksgiving”—though not the Pilgrim’s holiday. They metagain, at Buffalo on November 23. Object: Semper eadem!—“ever the same!” Wasthat thanksgiving or a death wish on Foster? The result suggests the latter, inits strangely halfhearted way, almost as if Crowley didn’t believe what he wasdoing. “This does not appear to have worked well. Vide infra!!!”18[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt310] When we do look on, as instructed, we find thatCrowley is back in New York City, and all is not well. “The three previousoperations had been unsuccessful, though some effect was evident. The returncurrent may have hit us [a reaction effect reminiscent of “evil be to he whoevil thinks”]. Soror H. has been very ill ever since leaving Buffalo, and I theday after I arrived in Chicago. We are still far from well. These Operations maybe all wrong; but we had better go on if it kills us both. Mr. . . . [Foster,presumably] has become very violent and aggressive.”True to his intent, he persisted on December 4 in the wee hours of a bitterlycold night, by gaslight, with “Mierka”; that is, Floria Comtesse deMartinpré,*112 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft112] a “respectable married woman” and“drug fiend.” Mierka, with her jet-black hair and “beautiful, statuesquefigure,” proved “astoundingly sensual, passionate, and voluptuous” and wasexhausted by a partially rejuvenated Crowley. He had met the lady the previousevening at a soiree hosted by Elvira (or Elvera) and William McNeir, stockbrokerof East 79th Street. They had kissed before three minutes of being alone hadelapsed. After the operation, Crowley’s health cleared up suddenly, and he awokewithout a cough and in “perfect condition,” but then, that was not the Object,was it? With the original object in (his) mind, Crowley and the lady joinedsexual forces three more times that week. After the fourth operation with Mierkain the small hours of December 7, Crowley concluded under “Result”: “These sevenOperations [Th. MF] may have been wholly spoilt because I had to ο . . . του αwrong.” The two Greek letters and Greek word are a mystery as to meaning.Whether the fatal rites were abandoned for moral or technical reasons, we knownot, but Matlack lived on until 1933. It might be argued that Jeanne made herdeal with her own “devil” when she married for security. Keeping her soul cameat a price for all concerned.CREATE IN ME A CLEAN BEAST, O GODJeanne was back with the Beast on a bitterly cold December 10, this time makingher contribution to an operation for “Magical Energy.” He recorded “InstantSuccess,” though how this energy was manifested is not mentioned. Crowleyobviously was in need of money again. A short story called “The Chute” had beenpublished in the International in November, but work was thin on the ground.19[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt311] Twenty dollars appeared “right away” followinganother sexual rite for “gold” during a snowstorm with Jeanne three days later,but he counted the operation a failure, despite the elixir’s being “sweet beyondall manner of sweetness.”20 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt312]Some time between then and the early hours of December 17, Crowley encountered aprostitute named Rita Gonzales, described as “a short sturdy whore—very sensualindeed—probably Virgo rising.” She was about twenty-six, very dark, and Spanish.This was the start of a wonderful relationship; though the Object of their firstsexual experience was the “full awakening of Phallos in Hilarion” and itsresultant Elixir nothing to be compared to that only Soror Hilarion couldproduce. By the end of the day, Crowley reckoned Jeanne’s response that daysuggested the operation was successful.image [images/9781620556313_050.jpg]Fig. 19.8. Crowley’s story “The Chute” appeared in The International, edited inwooden fashion by Viereck in November 1915.At 10:00 p.m. on the seventeenth, Rita participated in a rite for Hilarion’shappiness. “This is to include the Freedom of her love from what may cling.”Astonished, Crowley wrote that the superb operation had “converted” Rita “fromprofessionalism!” Rita had ceased to behave like it was her job and entered thespirit of the thing. There was something special about this girl. Crowleyclaimed immediate success for the operation. “The whole trouble cleared up thesame night.”21 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt313]Jeanne returned the following evening, the Object modest: “Power to continue TheGolden Rose which had languished of late weeks.” Sure enough, Crowley began asonnet and a lyric the next day.22 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt314]The relationship with Jeanne turned peculiar after an operation with Rita, threedays later. Perhaps this is not surprising, for Rita Gonzales had fallen“crazily” in love with Crowley, and this was no joke. The Object had been “TheWhole of Hilarion,” and it would appear from the next night’s activity that the“whole”—a most unexpected whole—is precisely what he got. Crowley described theresult of the sex magick with Rita as “wonderful,” an instant success. “I getthe whore in her [Jeanne], previously masked.”23 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt315]Was not Babalon meant to be a whore, “loud and adulterous”? Apparently not . . .at least, not quite like that. Like what? The occasion proved a turning point,and its mystery needs a little unpacking, as it was somehow bound up with theprecipitous decline in Jeanne and Crowley’s relations that cast a shadow overthe first half of 1916 and that would affect the Beast, arguably, for the restof his life.It was a cool, pleasant night when Jeanne and Crowley coupled under dim electriclight at the winter solstice, 1915 (December 22). The Object attempted to clearthe spiritual air of all the nastiness and fatal negativity of the previous twomonths or so: “Create in me a clean beast, O God, and renew a right spiritwithin me.” In the record, the Object is followed by a kind of confession: “Ihave been going through an appallingly bad time spiritually, going straight tothe Devil, in fact, all through not following out the formula ‘Keep on lovingand trusting!’ Now I have repented, and been treated better than the ProdigalSon himself! I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes. If I can’t curemyself of suspicion, I’m no good. Therefore I will. It might help to start a‘Liber III’ ceremony every time I have such a thought, or a thought ofinfidelity. Good; I’ll get the Sacred Burin out.”24[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt316] There then follows a paragraph whose cynicismincreases with each word.The Operation was all-perfect; Oh my Lord, grant me Thy Light and Peace! My ladygave herself to me utterly of her own accord, and with extreme love; how can Ibe so vile as to argue that this was because she knew of Leila’s attempt toseduce me yesterday, or because she feared what I might do in my jealous fit? Iwon’t blaspheme the IX°, however, so shall write “wonderful success” againstOperation CXXXVI!!!”25 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt317]The operation deemed a success was not that with Jeanne, but the previousnight’s with Rita, the one whose Object was the “whole” of Hilarion. Crowleyadded a P.S. to the remark on December 26: “The extreme cynicism of aboveremarks never struck me till re-reading.” Suddenly—or perhaps it was not sosudden—the Beast saw that Jeanne only came back to him due to an “ordinary”woman’s ordinary sexual jealousy; that is, a sudden alarm that Leila Waddellmight reclaim him otherwise, compounded by fear of what Crowley might do to messup her respectable life in a fit of jealousy over the hold that Matlack Foster(and perhaps another?) still had over her. In other words, her sexual commitmentto him (manifested with uncharacteristically whorelike fervor) was in the natureof a spiritually shallow seduction. Crowley had “seen through” her, and forthat, he thanked the operation with Rita, the unpretentious whore, who haddemonstrated to him at least, that Jeanne was not up to the role of ScarletWoman to the Magus. Ultimately she was self-serving, tied to the bonds of theBohemian’s and the Decadent’s greatest bugbear: respectability. As far asCrowley was concerned, he decided for his own sake that Jeanne had, if we maytake an anachronistic phrase, “blown it.”This may explain the curiously mysterious “Result” that Crowley attributes tothe rite of December 22 with Jeanne to make of him “a clean beast,” which in asense meant the will to make a “clean breast of it.” The ceremonial weapon forsuch a cut with the past was the magical dagger, an affirmation of will, andthis, it seems to me, may well explain a strange story that John Butler Yeatseagerly conveyed to John Quinn the following March.Crowley wrote the result as follows: “P.S. An XII [1916] image[images/img_008.jpg] [sign for the Sun] in sign for Leo. Result was that I tried[Word or symbol blotted out in MS.] of H[ilarion].!” Reflecting on the December22 rite in about August 1916, Crowley reckoned its result was evident insomething he did regarding Jeanne. Something of what he did may possibly bereflected in an irate letter about Crowley John Butler Yeats sent to John Quinnon March 16, 1916.Crowley sent at least one anonymous letter in late January 1916 to MatlackFoster, accusing Jeanne of living with a wealthy lawyer (she did not,apparently, know Quinn personally at the time) and further asserted that Jeanneintended to poison Foster. Failing to get a response, Crowley, according to JohnButler Yeats, waited outside Jeanne’s office at closing time. When Jeanneemerged on the street, Crowley threatened her, wielding a “curious-lookingknife.” The crowd’s closing in on the scene enabled Jeanne to escape.Something of this behavior may be reflected in Crowley’s incautious and somewhatpathetic statement in his Confessions thatI had by this time been enlightened as to the falseness of the Cat; it thereforebecame my duty to slay her.*113 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft113] I had createdtruth by means of an untrustworthy material and must therefore no longer clingto the image of the ideal. I must destroy it, well knowing that it would neveragain be possible for me to delude myself with poetical puppets. I must facereality for good and all.26 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt318]The melodramatic statement has a good five years of bitterness and emotionalself-removal in it. What Crowley probably never knew was that John Butler Yeatshad spilled the beans, as he understood them, on Crowley’s obsessive reaction tolosing control of Jeanne Foster.He boasts that he is not afraid because John Quinn will always find bail for himand protect him. She thinks he is a cocaine fiend. At the very start I hadwarned her, so that she has never let him get so much as a letter from her. Hehas some girl with him, and he sent this girl [Rita Gonzales?] to her with amessage to say that she [JRF] must help him or he would destroy her. The girlwept all the time while giving the message. Mrs. Foster told her politely to goto the devil. The Government here and the English government are both busywatching him with detectives. The English authorities say he is a spy and thathe has been to Canada.27 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt319]According to notes made by Richard Londraville after interviewing Jeanne Fosteron July 31, 1969, the “knife” scene was precipitated by Jeanne’s refusing to domundane secretarial work for him (on the Adams astrology project, no doubt).Crowley described the work intended as “far more meaningful than any writing youmight do for a magazine.” Failing to have his way, Crowley allegedly shouted,“If you refuse my orders, I will kill your mother. She is with you now, and Iwill kill her before your eyes.” Unable to subdue Crowley’s rage by hercustomary charm, Jeanne was deeply disturbed, according to her recollection, themore so because Crowley had no ordinary means of knowing that her mother wasresiding in New York with her at the time. Jeanne told Londraville that motherand daughter shared a bed that night, Jeanne intuiting “something might happen.”Sure enough, as the story goes, they were awakened at midnight by a hideousapparition at the foot of the bed, to which sight Jeanne allegedly recited aremembered white magic spell causing the demon to disappear. Explaining thesituation to her mother, her mother could not comprehend how such a thing couldever have come about; the magician was obviously depraved.28[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt320] As 1915 came to its close, all this, or whateverreally did happen, was still around the year’s corner.Crowley’s second Christmas in the States brought him an unexpected gift; perhapshe had at last found the “medical care” he felt he needed in the summer, in thehands of a “tart with a heart.” New York had been blurred by a flurry of snow onthe evening of Christmas day. The following afternoon—a Sunday—was warm again,and Rita Gonzales, “quite crazy” for Crowley (“God knows why”), came to secure amagical rite for “Health.” Crowley’s comments about his condition suggest manythings, among them that he was, in today’s parlance, a genuine sex addict. “WhatI need is recreation, friends, amusements, and if I don’t get them my reasonwill go. The continuous eyestrain is always instantly relieved by sexualintercourse. If H. were always with me, and I could lead the normal life of aman of my station, I should be healthy, happy, and virtuous. As it is, I’m goingthe way of the Artist! Magick must come to the rescue.”29[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt321]But would it? According to the New York Tribune that day, French presidentClemenceau in an article called “Young America and Old Europe” urged America toforget the past and look kindly on England, while news from England suggestedthat what Britain needed was new leadership; Asquith, it was held, should makeway for David Lloyd George. Who could Crowley make way for?"},{"pageContent":"TWENTYimage [images/9781620556313_099.jpg]Replacement TherapyWhile Crowley was in San Diego in November, the Fatherland refocused itspropaganda, attacking what it called “the Morgan Syndicate.” According toCharles A. Collman’s editorial:Probably nothing has so accentuated the growing distrust of Wall Streetthroughout the country as the recent revelations that many of the great savingsbanks of New York City were again keeping vast sums of their “surplus funds” ondeposit with the Morgan banks and trust companies, whose officers were usingthese tremendous accumulations of the people’s savings in widespread syndicateoperations.1 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt322]Propagandists aimed to get pro-German supporters and shareholders to protest tosavings banks participating in the “Anglo-French War Loan.” The Fatherland ’sChristmas 1915 issue, with a cover adorned by a “German’s Christmas Tree”unsubtly emblazoned with decorations made of the names of conquered Europeancities, opened its attack on John Revelstoke Rathom, editor of the ProvidenceJournal who was distributing anti-German leaflets while running agents to watchGerman embassy staff, and propagandists, in New York and elsewhere. TheFatherland ’s reaction would soon grow into a campaign against Britishintelligence in New York.Aleister Crowley’s contribution to the issue was an invented trip to Europe togauge Allied morale, Britain’s in particular. It may be that Crowley “covered”his West Coast trip by a story about going to Britain, though that seemsunlikely, especially if his “introductions” came through Viereck’s team. WhileCrowley’s “Behind the Front: Impressions of a Tourist in Western Europe” (firstof a two-part series) perhaps exhibited a feeling he had gained the Germanconfidence, the articles would spark serious trouble for Crowley’s associates inEngland when reprinted in the Rheinisch-Westfälische Zeitung and brought toRotterdam’s British Consulate General’s attention on June 30, 1916, leading toBritish Home and Foreign Office investigations and, in 1917, the kind of policeharassment that Crowley had specifically asked Feilding to fabricate back insummer 1915. Crowley’s communication with British intelligence was poor. In hisdefense, Crowley reckoned he was too “subtle” for intelligence officers to get agrip on his motives.This would have to change.In his articles on London, the fake visitor described fake impressions ofimaginary zeppelin damage, concluding about one raid in the first installment,“Hundreds, probably thousands must have perished. It is not clear why thisdistrict should have been selected for attack; it seems probable that thezeppelins had lost their bearings. The effect on London was not great; Hoxtonwas a place which it was the truest kindness to destroy!”—a conclusion pitiless,schoolboyish, and absurd.2 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt323] It can have done theGerman cause no credit, with zeppelin raids cruelly inefficient. That isunderstandably not how British authorities would see it, however.The second part continued the blasé account of carnage and damage. He mentionsCroydon, on London’s outskirts, saying that had the Germans hit his aunt’s housethere, he should not have had to trouble himself writing the article. In extremesatirical mode he requested that the zeppelins give it another shot and includedhis aunt’s actual address, “Eton Lodge, Outram Road,” to help them. One wondersif Crowley asked his dearest aunt’s permission for this, or did he reason thathis being a German propaganda asset (as far as they knew) meant that they mightleave Croydon alone in the future?He claimed a propaganda method of reductio ad absurdum, but this piece reducedabsurdity to the absolute dregs. The article says his “friends” in London couldnot understand his position at all. He says he quoted scripture: “They whom theLord loveth; he chasteneth,” adding, “If I had been at the Foreign Office as Iought to have been, there would have been no war at all. England would havestayed out, and insisted on France staying out. Germany would have been given afree hand to deal with Russia. This policy would have been in accord with everyEnglish statesman since 1830.”3 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt324] Palpablenonsense. He says his friends were “too busy hating the government to listen toanything I said.” This would certainly have upset British diplomats. Where thearticle would have really bitten was in his faux analysis of national psychologyunder stress of war: calm on the surface, uneasy and fearful beneath would bethe conclusion. There was nothing simply “absurd” about this. Howeverfabricated, it was good propaganda, because it undermined confidence inBritain’s confidence. It is difficult, as with all disinformation, to tell “who”was really writing the article at all. From other comments confided to his diarylater in the year, it seems Crowley’s “pro-German” persona was on “automatic.”As for his personal feelings, Crowley entered 1916 in a deep mess over fear ofrejection by Jeanne Robert Foster, a rejection that looked all the more final asJeanne reflected more deeply on what it was in life she valued most.A note on Crowley’s psychology: After the sudden death of his father whenCrowley was only twelve, he became aware at some level that his mother rejectedhim emotionally. Maintaining distance, her attention was confined to habitualreligious strictures of a repressed and repressive kind. He claimed in matureyears to have “hated” her; but it was love-hate, and not a little Oedipal. Sexmarked his sense of freedom from that rejection: a rejection of constraint. Histeenage triumph was to have laid the housemaid on his mother’s bed. Unorthodoxpsychologist and sometime Crowley disciple Israel Regardie remarked in hisdeeply considered book The Eye in the Triangle (1970) that Crowley was a bag ofneuroses and unresolved psychological complexes. His mystical and magicalattainments were extraordinarily impressive, as were his developed powers ofself-expression, but for all the advances on the spiritual or inner planes, interms of consciousness attained, the same old tangled web woven into reactivecharacter armor in the mundane personality persisted below, round in circles,often uncontrollably.Put simply, Crowley just couldn’t bear being rejected by those he loved, evenwhile dangerously, masochistically courting rejection; the rest didn’t matter.When rejected (as his poetic prophecies were), his personality immediatelyreached for the neurotic’s armor plating to protect itself. He became thevengeful lord of judgment whose liberty was being curtailed: the spoilt childlashing out. For a being who had, in order to become “Master of the Temple,”allegedly “destroyed” his ego—that is, no longer identified himself with the egocomplex—the residuum of personal desires and neurotic forces presented apersistent pressure (temporarily assuaged through sex), for it was axiomatic forCrowley that mental health required letting them out. He might transcend theensuing chaos in exalted trance, but then it was back to the machine and thenagging feelings appropriate to a human being who has lost, or fears losing,something he loves—and all this coated with a wild bravado anddefensive-aggressive wit. For one who had destroyed his ego, he was persistentlywrapped up in himself, and periods of “ego-lessness” might be equally describedas subjective aeons of nihilistic indifference. It might be argued, “what is thepoint of spiritual advancement, if the mundane personality is not whollyredeemed?”The process of assuming the Grade of Magus exacerbated personal problems.Assumption of the penultimate grade in that magical system he accepted whollynecessitated ideal accomplishments. First, he was to be the bearer of a Word, amessage that would overturn existing assumptions, as Gautama’s anatta (no soul)overturned traditional Hindu philosophical assumptions about the soul (atman).The Magus card in the tarot was numbered “I,” and that already looked forward tothe ultimate attainment (“Ipsissimus”): being beyond duality. There could be nocompeting identities. The Magus had to identify himself utterly with the Word(in his case, Thelema = Will) so that he might say as a whole being, Thélème,c’est moi! Trying to work that out, or through—for he felt the essentialinitiation was taking place “above” his rational mind—would occupy much ofCrowley’s inner life in 1916 and thereafter. His troubled love for Jeannedistracted him fundamentally from that process; she did not wish to go over tothe strange territory in which he had chosen to develop himself. The pressurewas too great, and she had alternatives.Crowley’s duty as a Magus was “Love”: to serve his fellow creatures, but it wasa love impersonal. A Magus must be master of magick, meaning there should benothing within him or beyond him to inhibit the True Will; the modern magician,he came to see, was one who dissolved complexes. To attain, he must leave theashes of his former karma or accumulated spiritual balance sheet behind, in whathe called the “Urn.” He must be reborn, and since that rebirth entailed amessage the world had not grasped (else there would be no reason to utter it), amessage that therefore seemed “contrary to Nature,” or the familiar course ofthings, the assumption of the grade involved also the assumption of the “curseof the Grade of Magus.” That is, he must speak, knowing he would bemisunderstood; that he would therefore appear a sower of dissension andmischievous lies. He would appear to men not as he did to himself. “AC,” hismundane self, would be a machine, a vehicle of manifestation.Crowley was bringing innumerable problems into his life, and his task as Maguswas to resolve them completely: a paradoxical aspiration, for following thegeneral ethic of Neitzsche, Crowley believed the true artist must attemptimpossibilities. That way greatness lay: spiritual transcendence inreality-facing embrace of life-as-it-is being the only thing worth living for,other than life itself. Did he then expect failure?There would be only four more rites of IX° magick with Jeanne in 1916. By thetime of the last, on January 28—for a “pure heart”—the affair was all over barthe shouting. A session on January 12 was sullied by “genral depression causedby disappointment in the long absence of Soror HILARION.”4[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt325] The next occasion, on January 17, was alsofrustrated, “owing to general worry,” despite its touching Object: “I loveyou.”5 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt326]These operations were interspersed by those with new pal Rita Gonzales, which,when not directed at acquiring money, were generously dedicated to “thewell-being of Hilarion.”6 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt327] A notable operationwas performed with Rita at half-past midnight on January 21, its Objectdesperate: “Hilarion back to me.” Crowley’s crazy confusion was indicated in theoperational notes: “Some scoundrel—I suspect F[oster] himself—has sent a letterto F[oster]. and H[ilarion]. thinks I wrote it. Qualis gens stulta! [“What foolsthese men are!”]” Result: “I called H[ilarion] this P.M. (5:00). She spoke quitenicely, though she has not yet had my letter exonerating myself.”7[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt328] This was probably the letter referred to byLondraville above, telling Matlack Foster that his wife was living with awealthy lawyer and was trying to poison him: an extremely desperate and foolishlover’s attempt to force a dramatic split in the marriage. Crowley added a P.S:“Camouflage. I wrote it.”In the event, Jeanne, perhaps fearful of what else he might do, called him onJanuary 22. Just under a week later they celebrated their forty-third, andfinal, act of sexual magick. Crowley noted its necessary brevity, while praisinga spontaneous and “orgiastic” quality; the Elixir: “most noble.” He wasn’t verysure its intended object—“a pure heart”—resulted. He was suffering, he wrote,“from curiosity and irritability and boredom. Otherwise I think I should bequite all right. But any IX° relieves the mental tension for a time.”8[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt329] Crowley needed sex to keep himself together,with or without Jeanne.He was in grim financial trouble. Despite January’s article for Vanity Fair(“Three Great Hoaxes of the War”),9 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt330] and arepellent disinformation piece, “The Crime of Edith Cavell,” for anundiscerningly omnivorous Fatherland, he was “flat broke.”10[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt331] A rite for “Money” with Rita on January 7elicited the note: “Some arrived at once. Also I met a man who may help much.”11[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt332] This may refer to Crowley’s meeting financierOtto Kahn in the first half of 1916 with respect to getting in touch withBritish Intelligence in New York (see here [9781620556313_c10.xhtml#p176]), orit may perhaps be a reference to Crowley’s taking on one “Stuart X” as a client.The Confessions has Crowley returning from California to resume a life of“anchorless tossing” whose only new feature was “my affair with Stuart X.” HenryStuart Clifford, a man with outspoken views on social economy, needed Crowley’shelp in organizing his panacea for social ills. This transpired to be A Prophetin His Own Country, by one “Stuart X.” Even Crowley’s written introduction couldnot save the self-published work (Washington, 1916) from obscurity. Businesswith Stuart X would take Crowley to Washington where he also met establishmentsculptor Paul Wayland Bartlett and London Times correspondent and Britishintelligence informant, Arthur Willert.Toward January’s end he chatted up one “Laylah,” a “small plump” AfricanAmerican girl who was a servant at the “house.”12[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt333] Which house, or indeed exactly where Crowley wasbilleted at the time, I know not. A sexual rite with her for “Money” Crowleydescribed as “complete failure,” though he thought the week “less awful” forhaving borrowed $50.February opened with a rite for “magical Courage”—that is, “To live up to theFormula of my Grade”—with Rita. He felt it worked immediately.13[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt334] On February 4, Rita availed her services againfor “Spiritual insight, especially into [the] Formula of my Grade.”14[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt335] Crowley grappled with antinomies between TheBook of the Law, based, he believed, on natural law, and ethics of “loving andtrusting” and “living in the sunlight” (the Aeon of Horus?), an unenviabledilemma. “Is a Magus to live ‘contrary to nature’ or not? Really, I have littledoubt that the appalling character of His job is due to this metaphysicalantinomy.”15 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt336] Crowley could be completelyrational but was aware that the “spiritual mind” looked down on the workings ofreason. His logic could be most peculiar as a result. Crowley’s mind was not asother minds.His conscious mind was still idealizing Jeanne Robert Foster at the end ofFebruary when he tried one last time a forlorn Object with Laylah: power overHilarion. “Failure, I suppose” he noted, adding that it worked the “wrong wayround, but Laylah hated LXXVI [Jeanne].”16 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt337]Jeannehad the power. There may be a reference here to the “dagger incident” recountedin the previous chapter, which could make Laylah, not Rita, the girl in tearssent around to threaten Jeanne, whom Jeanne told to go to the devil.Crowley wrote to John Quinn from 25 West 44th Street on March 1, 1916, about apropective business idea, sixteen days before John Butler Yeats’s letter toQuinn complaining about Crowley’s threatening Jeanne Robert Foster with a dagger(see here [9781620556313_c19.xhtml#p364]). Quinn first replied to Crowley on thetenth, before receiving Yeats’s letter of alarm about Crowley.Dear Mr Crowley,I received yours of March 1st. I have been so dreadfully driven that I have nothad a chance to acknowledge your letter before.Could you conveniently drop in to see me at my office tomorrow, Saturday 11th,at say four o’clock so that we can talk the matter over? When I know a littlemore of the facts I can express myself a little more definitely. If Saturdayafternoon is not convenient, Monday afternoon at the same time will be allright.Yours very truly,John Quinn17 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt338]On the same day that John Butler Yeats wrote to Quinn about the dagger incident(March 16), Quinn wrote again to Crowley about the latter’s scheme.Dear Mr Crowley,Referring to yours of March 1, stating that you were in touch with some peoplewho were thinking of starting a high-class paper and that “you are spoken of foreditor” and referring to your call, I beg to say that I have been thinking thematter over and feel that I do not care to endorse or give an opinion about thematter, the details of which I do not know. You need no certificate from me asto your literary ability or standing as a writer. Neither do you require anycertificate from me as to your critical ability, or your ability, with properfinancial backing, to associate writers of ability with you in the magazine. Butthere are so many factors connected with making such a thing a success, thefinancial thing, the personal thing, the kind of magazine to be produced, itsstyle, the nature of the business end, so many things that I know nothingwhatever about, that I must be excused from expressing my opinion as to whetheryou would make any such magazine a success.Yours very truly,John Quinn18 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt339]By the end of March, Crowley had accepted the inevitable. An operation with aprostitute called Carter “to replace LXXVI” (Hilarion)19[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt340] was, as far as the Magus was concerned, a greatsuccess, because on April 15, 1916, Alice Ethel Coomaraswamy (née Richardson)entered his life in a most resounding fashion, an encounter preceded three daysearlier by sex magick with another regular “assistant” of the period Gerda Mariavon Kothek.A letter from Quinn to Crowley (now living at 224 West 52nd Street), written onApril 17, the day after Crowley’s first sexual experience with Mrs. Coomaraswamycame to an ecstatic climax, shows even John Butler Yeats’s tale-telling aboutCrowley held little influence over Quinn’s personal judgment. He may well haveknown things about Crowley’s activities the Yeatses did not.Dear Mr. Crowley,I received yours of the 16th this morning. The large decoration by Augustus Johnis at the Coffee House, 54 West 45th Street. Sometime when I am less rushed thanI am now, I am sorry to say, I might take you in there for tea and show it toyou. It is worth seeing.I have heard nothing new in the other matter. I passed it along but did not giveyour address. I told the person if he was interested he could call me on thetelephone and that I could make an appointment for a meeting, but I have heardnothing since about it.Yours very truly,John Quinn20 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt341]What the “other matter” may have been, we are in no position even to guess.THE SPYING GAMEAccording to Spence, before Crowley arrived in San Francisco in late 1915,Commander Mansfield Cumming, chief of the British Secret Intelligence Service,operating at the time as MI1c, picked Sir William Wiseman to run theincreasingly important British intelligence effort in the United States ofAmerica. When Wiseman arrived on the east coast, Captain Guy Gaunt, fearing lossof status, complained.Wiseman returned to London and reported, but was back in Manhattan in January1916 with full Foreign Office support to establish MI1c, Section V, at theConsulate, 44 Whitehall Street. It is still not clear when, or even if, Crowleycontacted Wiseman, directly or otherwise, but Wiseman probably knew something ofCrowley’s activities either from Gaunt, the foreign office,*114[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft114] or from Lieutenant Everard Feilding’scommunications with his N.I.D. superiors after the Statue of Liberty incident.21[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt342] Spence takes it that some time in 1916 Crowleyoperated in a “loop” including Wiseman, Gaunt, and new British Consul in NewYork, Charles Clive Bayley, whom Crowley knew from friendly meetings at Moscow’sBritish Consulate in 1913.22 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt343]image [images/9781620556313_051.jpg]Fig. 20.1. Captain Guy Reginald Archer Gaunt (1870–1953), British naval attaché,New York, 1914–1917In an affidavit on “my [Crowley’s] Political Attitude since August 1914,”written shortly after March 8, 1917, and intended to clarify his activities forboth British and American intelligence purposes, Crowley (as we saw in chapter10) maintained that while he was in Washington, he wrote a letter of sympathy tonaval attaché Capt. Guy Gaunt R.N., over the Fatherland’s attacks on him for“bribing the office boy” (a great embarrassment for Gaunt; see below), whileoffering Gaunt his help and service. Though Gaunt’s reply was “cordial,” Crowleyunderstood it to indicate Gaunt regarded the Fatherland ’s activities asunworthy of his interest.image [images/9781620556313_052.jpg]Fig. 20.2. U.S. news report (October 2, 1915): Charles Clive Bayley appointedBritish Consul General in New York, succeeding Sir Courtenay Walter Bennett.Crowley met Bayley in Moscow in 1913.Crowley’s affidavit then asserts that after a conversation with Otto Kahn,Crowley applied to Gaunt formally for work relating to the Fatherland, to IrishAmerican agitation, and to Indian revolutionary activity, insisting that he had“ever since” kept Gaunt informed of his address, “so as to be ready if called.”Gaunt apparently did not reply, so Crowley took the advice of his friend PaulWayland Bartlett23 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt344] and spoke to Arthur Willertof Washington, D.C., about the matter.A further “Memorandum” in the same document indicates Crowley’s seizing theopportunity of getting inside the Fatherland.I saw a chance to be useful. I wrote him [Viereck] a lot of articles, andproclaimed the Irish Republic. I pointed out the possibilities of this course toFeilding, and urged him to get me some more work, officially. Still nothingdoing, but I made him reports on the activities of von Rintelen [sabotage agentimplicated in the attempted assassination of Morgan in June 1915; see here[9781620556313_c16.xhtml#p295]], and some other matters. I was much handicappedby lack of time, but did my best. I saw Capt. Gaunt, and suggested that I couldbe of great use in keeping track of the Irish-Americans, and so on; but I havenot yet heard definitely from him. . . . The idea in all this was to encourageGermany to brave the USA and so force the breaking-off of relations.24[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt345]It is reasonable to assume Wiseman received this information at some point.Crowley refers specifically to the time he wrote to Britain’s naval attaché: itwas when the Fatherland was attacking Gaunt for “bribing the office boy etc.”Tracing relevant articles reveals much about the Fatherland ’s busting ofGaunt’s operation in New York, making Wiseman’s arrival even more apposite, andGaunt’s well-known dismissal of Crowley as “small time traitor” in circa 1950more comprehensible.25 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt346] Having been roundlyexposed by the Fatherland, Gaunt would have found it hard or impossible to trustCrowley, who was so close to it, and whom he might well have thought was baitinghim. In this sense, the dynamic of Crowley’s scheme worked against him. His“freelancing” would easily suggest the potential of his playing double-agent.Crowley’s reputation would hardly have assisted his cause.What was meant by the “bribing of the office boy”? On May 24 the Fatherlandpublished a sensational coup: “The Criminal Methods of Capt. Guy Gaunt CMG NavalAttaché of the British Embassy, HOW THE BRITISH SECRET SERVICE RIFLES U.S.MAIL.”Not long ago Capt. Gaunt requested a mutual friend to introduce him to theeditor of the Fatherland. He expressed the desire to meet Mr. Viereck as “amatter of curiosity.” Evidently, Capt. Gaunt was unable to restrain hiscuriosity, for before it was possible to arrange a meeting he attempted to bribean office boy in the employ of Dr. K. A. Fuehr to rifle Mr. Viereck’s mail.26[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt347]Gaunt obtained thereby “letters passing between Dr. Fuehr and Dr. H. F. Albert,Financial Attaché of the German Embassy, and other matters of interest to HisMajesty’s Government. . . . How long will the American Government tolerate thecriminal methods of Capt. Gaunt and his cohort of spies?” The paper requested“the President to ask the British Government forthwith to relieve us of thenoxious presence of the head of its spy system, Capt. Guy Gaunt.”The story appeared in an edition whose cover showed a woman in jail with a balland chain, gazing to the light beyond the bars; the caption, “Ireland”—her onlyhope being German victory, now April’s Easter Rising of Irish Republicans inDublin27 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt348] had reached a bitter end.*115[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft115] “Forgeries of the British Secret Service” wasthe Fatherland’s editorial on May 31, 1916.Last week the Fatherland showed larceny, bribery, and theft in the operations ofCapt. Guy Gaunt, Naval Attaché of the British Embassy and head of its SecretService. This week we show how English agents resort to forgeries, fakes, andthe “planting” of spurious letters [and] exposed the criminal plottings of Capt.Guy Gaunt, Naval Attaché of the British Embassy. It showed how one of his agentshired an employee of Dr. K. A. Fuehr to betray his employer, turn his lettersover to the agents of Capt. Gaunt, and even to go to the extent of robbing hisemployer’s office.The Fatherland is informed that Capt. Gaunt is uneasy in his mind over thisexposure, and that when he consulted his counsel, Frederick R. Condant, memberof the American Rights Committee, the lawyer advised him: “Keep your nerve.Laugh it off.” The Fatherland can assure Capt. Gaunt that this is no laughingmatter.28 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt349]Readers will recall Frank Burke’s obtaining the briefcase of Dr. Albert on theelectric train in July 1915 (see here [9781620556313_c17.xhtml#p318]), and theclaim of one of Gaunt’s principal agents, Czech spy ring leader Emanuel Voska,that he, not Burke, was responsible for nabbing the incriminating briefcase.Page 260 of the Fatherland accused Voska “of forgery in cahoots with Czechspies” in producing propaganda for J. Rendstoke Rathom’s Providence Journal tothe effect that Germans in the United States reported to Mexico’s General Juarezand intended to fight America should the German ambassador be withdrawn in eventof war. This forgery, asserted the Fatherland, was part of a British plot toshow that Germans were waging war against the United States. The paper notedthat both Gaunt the spy and Rathom the spy-catcher came from Melbourne,Australia: linked by blood and British colonialism!Gaunt’s role in the British Secret Service in the United States was announced inthe New York Herald, April 30, 1916, with the byline “The British Diplomatistand the Office Boy”—hence Crowley’s sympathy over the “office-boy” affair. The“boy” was Alfred Hoff, bribed by Gaunt to take letters between Fuehr and Albertto be photographed. Precise details of the bribe were exposed. Hoff wanted $250for a motorcycle. When Gaunt and Hoff went to the McAlpin Hotel to undertake theexchange, a Herald detective followed them. The detective got Alfred Hoff tosqueal, and Gaunt’s position was painfully compromised. Fellow spooks Wiseman,his number two Norman Thwaites, and Robert Nathan (with special duties forlocating networks of Indian revolutionaries) succeeded in avoiding attention. Itis possible, but mere conjecture all the same, that Gaunt nursed the idea thatCrowley may have been involved in his discomfiting public exposure.Before we leave early spring 1916, with Crowley on the verge of fresh adventuresin love, magick, and spying, we should hear a word for the woman Crowleylovingly described as “a regular streetwalker,” who had kept him going throughthe worst of his heart’s desolation. Reflecting on the character of RitaGonzales in the early 1920s Crowley wrote:She had been familiar with hardships, callousness, obsession, shame, and povertyfrom her cradle; but she possessed every noble quality to the full. Hers was thetrue pride, generosity, purity, and passion to which the Cat [Jeanne] so baselypretended; and hers also the clearinsighted intelligence, the wide experienceand deep insight of the Snake [Helen Westley]. Yet she had faced and conqueredher foes, instead of acquiescing in despair.29 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt350]No sentimentalist who swooned over individual prostitutes as “angels in themud,” Crowley had found many in his experience victims of their own defects.Rita, however, was special. “Indeed, I failed to realize consciously thesublimity of this girl until long afterwards.” He came to see she exercised amission of care for him, whose time was limited to need. Rita disappeared at theend of March “without a word and all my efforts to trace her were fruitless.”30[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt351] Here’s looking at you, Rita . . . wherever youare."},{"pageContent":"TWENTY-ONEimage [images/9781620556313_099.jpg]The Owl and the Monkey Went to SeaThe Owl and the Pussycat went to seaIn a beautiful pea green boat,They took some honey, and plenty of money,Wrapped up in a five pound note.The Owl looked up to the stars above,And sang to a small guitar,‘O lovely Pussy! O Pussy my love,What a beautiful Pussy you are, You are, You are!What a beautiful Pussy you are!EDWARD LEAR, “THE OWL AND THE PUSSYCAT,” 1871During the summer of 1916, Crowley reflected on the roles that women wereplaying in his life, deciding that they were sent as part of the initiation tothe grade of Magus. He had in his mind familiar images of ancient Egyptianritual. As the initiate passed through the pylons, the stages would be guardedby priests and priestesses wearing animal masks who could pass him if heresponded correctly to a choice or ordeal. Jeanne Foster became “the Cat.” Gerdavon Kothek he called “the Owl,” while Alice Ethel Comoaraswamy was “the MonkeyOfficer,” or just the Monkey. Typically, monkeys won’t leave you alone.As usual he symbolized relationships as the ordeals; thus, the Cat representedthe “ideal,” as against the Snake representing the earthly, cynical, andattainable, with despair at the end; similarly, the Owl represented “socialacceptance,” and the Monkey, the hard road of “continual disquietude and almostcertain disappointment.” This is interesting because for all Crowley’s regulartalk of the “past Aeon of Osiris” accepting a formula of redemption by death andsacrifice, his own experience incorporated the idea. Willingness to “die” wasthe condition for life and new consciousness, and although sacrifice of theego’s desires was symbolic, it nevertheless entailed real hardship and severedenials, and death is as much a transition in the new, as in the old, Aeon.Crowley’s repugnance for evangelical atonement doctrine (based, in his opinion,upon “savage superstition”) accounts for his need to emphasize a fundamentaldistinction between old and new. Crowley refused to accept sorrow as thecharacteristic of life’s essence. He would doubtless have been moved by therecent rediscovery of the Gnostics’ “laughing Jesus.”We don’t really know how Crowley came to meet Sri Lankan art critic andhistorian Ananda Kent Coomaraswamy (1877–1947), recently arrived (February 24,1916) in New York from England with his English wife, but Spence reckons thatCoomaraswamy was a man British intelligence would want to keep tabs on and thatwould be sufficient for Crowley to take an interest.1[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt352]Thanks to an introductory letter from Irish literary figure,T. W. Rolleston,*116 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft116] John Quinn becameacquainted with Coomaraswamy soon after his arrival, inviting him and Mrs.Coomaraswamy to dinner with himself and journalist and old schoolfriend of W. B.Yeats, Charles Johnston, at 58 Central Park West on March 14.2[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt353] Quinn gave Coomaraswamy introductions andcommended Coomaraswamy’s scholarship, citing his monograph on “Rajput Painting”(published by the Oxford University Press), among other scholarly works onIndian art, not only to W. B. Yeats (February 26, 1916)3[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt354] but also in a letter of March 9, 1915, topresident of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Robert W. DeForest, suggesting thatDeForest encourage Coomaraswamy to give a talk at the Metropolitan Museum.4[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt355]Child of a Sri Lankan father and English mother, Coomaraswamy favored radicalIndian nationalist politics. In 1917 he was only permitted to leave England forAmerica so long as he did not speak or write against England.5[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt356] His early works on art theory were informed byWilliam Morris’s Arts and Crafts movement and anarchic, anticapitalist,anticolonial sentiments, inspiring him to see industrialism as the root of manyof the world’s evil: a point of view with which Crowley would have sympathized.He looked to post-industrialism as an objective critique combined with a needfor revolution.Having divorced Ethel Mary Partridge in 1913, Coomaraswamy married AliceRichardson (1885–1958), who had already borne him a son, Narada, in 1912;daughter Rohini joined the family in 1914. A sergeant major’s daughter, born inYorkshire, England, Alice Ethel Richardson was early on captivated by Indianmusic. More than fifty years before George Harrison studied with Ravi Shankar,Alice trained as a singer of Hindustani classical music and took the stage name“Ratan Devi” to bring India’s classical music to non-Asian audiences.One can see plenty of meat for conversation between Crowley and the couple.Spice was added to the dish by Crowley’s meeting a woman whom Mr. Coomaraswamyalso lusted after. The woman was, according to Crowley—with how much strictveracity is unknown—a “German prostitute.” There may have been an intelligenceangle here also. Calling herself Gerda von Kothek (1896–1967)—the surname apermutation of her mother’s maiden name of Koth6[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt357]—she was born Gerda Sofie Schumann into aprominent Dresden family of journalists and critics. Gerda lived in the Statesfrom 1902 to 1920, and at the time Crowley knew her was married to RudolfGebauer, a New Jersey chemist who shared Gerda’s communist fervor and had linksto radical socialist paper, the New Yorker Volkszeitung (“People’s Daily”).7[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt358] Like Hugo Münsterberg, Gebauer was a member ofthe German University League. Following intelligence from an unnamed source, theU.S. Bureau of Investigation investigated Gebauer inconclusively in April 1917.Crowley first performed sexual magick with Gerda on April 12, followed threedays later by an ecstatic coupling with Mrs. Coomaraswamy. In fact, the opusonly began on April 15, continuing on to the next day: the “most magnificent inall ways since I can remember. The Orgasm was such as to have completely drownedthe memory of the Object, but after, I found myself saying ‘Namo Shivaya namahaAum’ [celebratory Hindu mantra praising Shiva, god of universal dissolution].”8[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt359]A further six rites, devoted mainly to “Glory to God,” with Alice Coomaraswamyraised Crowley’s spirits before they met again in Bronxville on April 28 for anorgasm so extraordinary the Object was altogether forgotten. On April 27, theObject was to have a baby boy, and Alice duly conceived.According to Crowley, Ananda Coomaraswamy tried to unload his wife on him. Hedid this as though he might obtain something from Crowley in return and wascompletely taken aback when, informing Crowley that he might have to considerdivorce, Crowley simply said, “I have no personal feeling in the matter.”Crowley was not going to get attached to anyone unless he decided it. He’d hadenough of the pains of clinging love, and he saw through Coomaraswamy.PHILADELPHIAAlice clung tightly to Crowley on his trip to Philadelphia in mid-May, shortlyafter German saboteur Captain Friedrich Hinsch’s men had blown up part of the DuPont munitions plant at Gibbstown, Greenwich Township, to Philadelphia’ssouthwest. Whether Crowley went to Philadelphia with this in mind is unknown,though there is no doubt he was well informed when it came to German sabotage,knowledge evinced in fictional form in the lively Simon Iff story The NaturalThing to Do, written in late 1916 or early 1917. Its main line is sleuth SimonIff ’s “busting” of German maritime sabotage in the United States and a seriesof apparently disconnected murders of key people related to the politics ofnaval supply. In an unusual scene for Simon Iff, the Thelemite know-all magus ofcriminal investigation gets very drunk in New York with “Mollie Madison,” awitty female friend closely based on Jeanne Foster.His behavior scandalized most of the very high-class guests at that most selectof all New York’s restaurants. He took the most unpardonable liberties withMollie Madison, and Lascelles was equally impudent with Dolores, making violentlove to her, drinking her health in crazy toasts of doubtful taste, tellingstories which would hardly have passed even Mr. Gatt’s editorial staff, androaring with laughter at nothing at all.. . . He [Iff] told everybody what a wonderful man he was, and what a lot ofmysteries he had solved, and what mountains he had climbed, and what animals hehad shot, and what an important job he was holding down that very minute.Wouldn’t everybody be surprised if they knew just what the British Governmenthad sent him to do in America? . . . And wouldn’t everybody be amazed if theyknew just what he knew about a certain subject that he wouldn’t mention—not he!The Silent Tomb was a chatter-box compared to him!9[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt360] [my italics]It seems to have been on this visit to Philadelphia that Crowley met up withFrank Harris’s friend writer Louis Wilkinson (1888–1966) and his wife, bisexualpoet Frances Gregg (1885–1941). The visit may have been artistically motivated.It was in Philadelphia’s drab outskirts that Hilda Doolittle (“HD”; 1886–1961)had grown up with fellow poet Ezra Pound (1885–1972). Before Doolittle began alesbian affair with Frances Gregg, she and Pound shared a commitment toinnovation in poetry, later known as “Imagism.” Imagists favored starkverbalization of precise images, rather than meter-serving, classical rhymingdisciplines that Crowley had worked so hard to master. Imagist experimentationpioneered modernist poetry; Crowley was not a fan, considering Pound all show,wind, and weak on word. But Pound was only one among a group of Imagistsredefining an aesthetic of sound, and Crowley was always interested in newthings. He was certainly attracted to the beautiful Frances Gregg, though Greggwas unnerved by Crowley. Bisexuality he considered the ideal, in line withDecadent, occult aesthetics stemming from the 1880s and 1890s French OccultRevival’s veneration of the Androgyne.Crowley had known of Pound after the latter’s arrival in London in 1908. There,Pound introduced former fiancée HD and poet Richard Aldington to the EiffelTower group in Soho, and to one another; they would marry. Greek models ofverbal compression fascinated, including, not surprisingly, Sappho. Poundapparently coined the term “Imagistes” at this time. Interest in Sappho mightjust explain a ploy Crowley relates to Ananada Coomaraswamy’s “Black Brother”deviousness.He happened to be momentarily hard up and conceived the really brilliant idea ofconcocting a fable that his German girl was a new Sappho. He made her copy out anumber of poems from my Collected Works and sent her round to Putnam’s topersuade them to publish the really remarkable work of this romantic youngAmerican beauty rose. The girl [Gerda] told his wife [Alice] in bed one night,they having found a bond of common sympathy in their contempt and loathing for“The Worm” as we had familiarly called him. She told me at once, and I haveevery reason to believe that the letter I wrote to Putnam’s is treasured in thearchives of the firm as the last word in savage contempt.10[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt361]Several of Crowley’s poems celebrating lesbian love had appeared in hisCollected Works (1905–1907). The detail about Coomaraswamy’s wife and Gerdabeing in bed Crowley explained as being due to Coomaraswamy’s habitual meanness;that is, that a single bed was cheaper than single rooms and the Eurasian misersaved money when away by putting his girlfriend in bed with his wife! One mightsafely conclude that not all the experimentation going on in Philadelphia andNew York was of an austerely aesthetic nature.Poet and lecturer John Cowper Powys (1872–1963) was also involved withPhiladelphia, and with Frances Gregg. Cambridge graduate Powys came to Americain 1905, joining, in 1911, the University Lecturers Association of New York,founded by Louis Wilkinson and another friend of Crowley’s, Arnold Shaw. Powysmet Gregg in 1912, and Gregg became extremely important to him. Already married,the situation was fraught. Powys dealt with it partly by encouraging fellowEnglishman Louis Umfreville Wilkinson to marry Frances so that they might remainintimate friends without scandal. This created more problems, as one mightexpect, and in 1916, Powys fell into acute depression over his confused, intensefeelings for his friend’s wife. This was the time Crowley first encountered thisintriguing coterie of literary expats and Americans. Powys and Wilkinson soughtillumination of the condition from the works of Sigmund Freud, to whom Crowleywrote an undecipherable letter in 1917, the year in which he would correspondregularly and familiarly with Wilkinson, offering him a literary outlet inViereck’s International magazine. Writer Paul Newman reports an unattested storyof his wife Frances encountering Crowley, apparently in the throes of disguisinghimself in her house. The story may come from a reminiscence given by Frances toOliver, her son by Louis.Another time she [Gregg] entered a dark room in her house and came across a baldman sitting at a table alone. Becoming aware of her, this eerie stranger pickedup a dark mat of hair from the table, placed it on his head and transformed intoCrowley. He then hauled up a case, in which Frances identified a whole nest ofwigs, and silently left.11 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt362]Crowley remained friends with Wilkinson to the end of his days. The reason mayperhaps be found in Oliver’s appreciation of the father. Oliver Wilkinsonremembered him as one who “fought against evil conventions and laws. He wasruthless in some of his personal relationships, but ruthless, too, in fightingdamnable prejudices.” Like Crowley, Wilkinson had long been the family’s blacksheep; unlike Crowley, he eventually won them round by distinction in writingand lecturing.As spring turned to early summer, Crowley made frequent trips to Washington witha pregnant Alice (her husband was living with Gerda). One of these trips gaverise to the resurgence of the Irish revolutionary, in the letters page of theWashington Post (May 12, 1916): Crowley’s alter ego’s response to the DublinEaster Rising.IRELAND AS PEACE ARBITERIrish Poet Would Have Forgiveness Not Revenge, Free Erin’s MottoEditor Post: On the third of July last at sunrise at the foot of the statue ofLiberty in New York Harbor, I proclaimed publicly the independence of Ireland. Ibegat the Irish Republic on the great Mother Time. In due course the first bornhas come to light; and its martyr blood cries to Heaven from the ruins ofDublin.The blood of the martyrs is the seed of the republic. Smitten to earth, we riseagain, ninefold more strong.But must blood still call for blood? Hate still breed hate? “Forgive them.Father, for they know not what they do.” Ireland was of old, the island of thesaints; for many a long year she has been the island of the martyrs. For me thewatchword of our free republic shall not be revenge, but forgiveness. I wouldmake Ireland the arbiter of universal peace. Let us but be free to follow ourgreat destiny, and all men—and our oppressors first—shall be our brothers. Inthis hour when the mildest man might well be lashed to fury I hold out theswordless hand of fellowship. England! There are stainless and noble passageseven in your history. If we, as we gaze upon the bodies of our murderedbrothers, remember them cannot you do likewise?Let us be free; let us have peace! Tomorrow I may cite that other word ofChrist: “Lo! I bring no peace, but a sword.” God save the Irish republic! I am,sir, your obedient servant.ALEISTER CROWLEY“Somewhere in America”He was back in Washington on May 25, where at 8:30 p.m., sex magick was devotedto a safe pregnancy for Alice. “A very good Operation, considering theover-excitement of having her come to me alone and definitely on the dayagreed.”12 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt363]Three days later, the Washington Post recorded Crowley had been at the NationalPress Club in Washington, D.C., on the twenty-sixth, where he had played—andlost—a series of chess matches with U.S. chess wizard Norman Tweed Whitaker, atough call for a Cambridge chess Half Blue. It is striking to imagine Crowleymaking his way about the capital with the lovely Alice Ethel in May 1916. TheMay 26 Alexandria Gazette head-line reported Washington’s stiff message sent tothe British and French governments insisting they had no right to interfere withfirst-class mail from America on the high seas; the language, said the Gazette,was similar to that used when condemning the German submarine campaign, asubject much on Crowley’s mind. Meanwhile, the Lincoln Memorial, which had beenshipped almost complete, quite amazingly by barges along the Potomac, hadfinally been craned onto its empty site, still awaiting final construction. AWashington without Lincoln? Unthinkable.THE ELIXIR OF LIFEMany years after the events, Crowley would tell the story of the extraordinaryeffects of his having produced and imbibed the “elixir of life.” Readers ofnewspaper stories published in the 1930s doubtless imagined the fabled elixirvitae had been prepared in the romantic confines of a medieval alchemist’slaboratory. In fact, the elixir that gave Crowley something akin to superhumanvigor was cooked up in a series of IX° operations with Gerda von Kothek, AliceEthel Coomaraswamy, and “Mother of Heaven” Leila Waddell in June 1916.The first opus took place on June 4 with Gerda. Crowley was very tired anddoubtless already thinking of a summer retirement when he made the Object oftheir exertions “Juventutem.” The use of this word for the rite has its owninterest.There is today an international Catholic youth organization, established inApril 2004, called “Juventutem” for young people enthusiastic about theTridentine Mass. Its obligations compare interestingly with Crowley’sactivities. Members should adore “Our Lord” at a church once a week. The Latinjuventutem means “youth,” and its use in Catholic liturgy is inspired by Psalm42:4 where the psalmist goes with joy to the altar of God. The opening prayersof the traditional mass recited by priest and altar server express the idea,Introibo ad altare Dei. Ad Deum qui laetificat juventutem meam. (“I will go into the altar of God; to God, the joy of my youth.”) So Catholic understandinginterprets juventutem as spiritual youth derived from the grace of Jesus Christ.In O.T.O. understanding, this grace is manifest in the IX°. There is nothinghere that would upset Sethian Gnostics of late antiquity, but would surelyperturb the Vatican!Crowley went to the “altar” to adore God with Gerda on June 4 at 10:25 p.m. inNew York City. The Elixir was “extremely well-formed, strong, sweet, aromatic.”It was the first of six recorded doses.Perhaps Crowley’s recent visit to Philadelphia stimulated Louis Wilkinson’sfriend Frank Harris to write a note to Crowley from 3 Washington Square on June8. Harris expressed admiration for Crowley’s poetry collection, The WingedBeetle (1910), which he had asked Crowley to send him, presumably connected witha writing job in the offing: “You’ve just phoned me—I’m in every morning andevening at nine. Not well today but ever cordially yours. FRANK HARRIS.”13[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt364]Two days later, Leila Waddell joined Crowley for Juventutem, as did Alice EthelCoomaraswamy for the same Object on June 12, 16, and 18 when the Elixir was“very good and strong.”14 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt365] The final operationfor “Youth” was performed admirably with Gerda on June 20. Three days laterCrowley was some 217 miles northeast of New York at a cottage belonging toEvangeline Adams right by the shores of Newfound Lake, Bristol, New Hampshire.Very soon, the Magus found that something very odd began to happen to him."},{"pageContent":"TWENTY-TWOimage [images/9781620556313_099.jpg]Aleister Crowley’s Psychedelic SummerBristol in the year 1916 was a small town in Grafton County, New Hampshire, oneof four lakeshore towns close to Newfound Lake, known locally as Lake Pasquaney.It had been a holiday destination since the mid-nineteenth century. Crowleydescribed the area briefly in his Simon Iff adventure The Pasquaney Puzzle.Lake Pasquaney lies among the mountains of New Hampshire. It is about seventeenmiles in circumference. Bristol, the nearest railway station, a town of twelvehundred inhabitants, is some three miles from the lower end. The lake containsseveral islands, and its shores are dotted with summer villas, mostly of thelog-hut type, though here and there is a more pretentious structure, or acluster of boarding-houses. Bristol is about three hours from Boston, so thelake is a favorite summer resort, even for week-enders. Automobile parties passfrequently, but keep mostly on the road on the east shore, that on the westbeing very rough. The scenery is said by Europeans who know both to compare withScotland or Switzerland without too serious disadvantage.1[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt366]Crowley described his summer residence as the “Adams Cottage” because itbelonged to Evangeline Adams, with whom he was still engaged writing theastrology book (he may have taken a room in the Carnegie Studios, New York,where Evangeline herself lived, after he returned from California). Websitesdevoted to Crowley and New Hampshire have repeated the story that the cottage inwhich Crowley experienced remarkable phenomena in summer 1916 was at Hebron, tothe north of the lake, as Miss Adams possessed a residence there. However,Crowley’s correspondence was return-addressed “North Bristol,” and hisdescription of events does not satisfactorily match the Hebron property’sposition.image [images/9781620556313_054.jpg]Fig. 22.1.

The “Adams Cottage,” (back), Bristol, New Hampshire, as it is today.(photo courtesy, Colin Campbell)In 2016 local history researcher Colin Campbell discovered property recordsshowing Adams acquired a cottage in North Bristol/Alexandria, south of Hebron,in 1913 through the will of either her brother, or possibly uncle, CharlesFrancis. Colin found the cottage’s location through a legal transfer fromCharles (d. 1915) to Evangeline, thence to Josephine Haviland, and afterward tothe O’Connor family. Citing tax payment records, he then identified and matchedthe O’Connor lots by description of the property described in the deeds. The lottracing back to 1915 is Bristol, N.H. Tax Map 108, Lot 014, and the location andtopography matches Crowley’s description perfectly. The cottage is stillthere,*117 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft117] sitting right on 113 West Shore Road,fifteen yards left of the corner with Don Gerry Road, Bristol, with the obviouslater addition of a second story. Especially convincing is a small “bump”section of the house, noted by Crowley in a ground plan of the cottage Crowleysent to an expert on atmospheric electrical phenomena. The kitchen area is asCrowley described it.2 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt367] Now the location can beplaced clearly in mind, one can very easily imagine Crowley’s activities in andabout the cottage that summer. And what a summer it was!Crowley had barely alighted from the train at Bristol’s homely wooden railroadstation by the Pemigewasset River on June 21—the summer solstice—when he tookhold of a curious telegram from Vancouver. It was Charles Stansfeld Jones(1886–1950) informing his superior in the Order in veiled terms that he hadtaken the “Oath of the Abyss” and emerged a Master of the Temple, a dweller ofthe city of the pyramids, with the motto Unus in Omnia, Omnia in Unum (One inAll, All in One). Crowley was too much “in a fit” at the time to decipher thetelegram’s meaning or its import. Since their last meeting on June 18, he hadbeen disturbed by relations with Alice Ethel Coomaraswamy.image [images/9781620556313_056.jpg]Fig. 22.3. Charles Stansfeld Jones (Frater Achad’s) 1909 Probationercertificate, giving him the motto “Unus in Omnibus Omnia in uno” (One ineverything, all in one), LATER adapted for his 1916 Master of the Temple mottoCrowley described Ethel’s double-mindedness in Confessions. When common sensesuggested that she best attend to her two children, her mind would be occupiedwith art; when she might best surrender to artistic work, her “trolls” wouldoccupy her thoughts, leaving art abandoned. A typical mother, in other words!This all fits Crowley’s basic Decadent stance that spiritual attainment isincompatible with bourgeois morality.At their last meeting—intended as a temporary farewell—she told him how herpregnancy’s visibility had prompted her husband to persuade her to avoid publicgaze by undergoing confinement in England. According to Crowley, “He [AnandaCoomaraswamy] had now cunningly pretended to give way about the divorce,admitting my right to my child and its mother. His real motive was verydifferent. She was a particularly bad sailor. During a previous pregnancy, shehad been obliged to break the journey to save her life. She was in fact on thebrink of death when they carried her ashore and she lay for weeks so ill that abreath of wind might have blown her away. It was, at least, not a bad bet thatthe Atlantic voyage would end in the same or even more fortunate way.”3[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt368] Crowley’s dark suspicion about “Black Brother”Coomaraswamy’s motives was afterward inflated to deliberate murder in the SimonIff story Not Good Enough, where the callous killer is named uncompromisingly as“Ananda Haramzada Swamy,” haramzada being Hindustani for “bastard.”According to his Confessions, Crowley refused to pressurize Alice Ethel furtherin one direction or another, simply saying, “Here’s my address. You’re welcomewhenever you like to come, and I love you and I will serve you with every ounceof my strength.” On June 23, Alice turned up at the lakeside cottage. Crowleydedicated a 9:00 p.m. opus to the Object, “A new girl this summer,” presumablybecause despite love’s “rapture” being temporarily renewed in mutual artisticpleasure, the lady had nonetheless decided maternal duties must take precedence,when she felt ready. She had come because she hated being without him, but sheleft with their unborn child after more magical sex with the Object “a perfectgirl for the summer.”Perhaps Alice had secretly hoped Crowley would beg her, even insist, on herstaying. That was not Crowley’s way; she must find her own “true will.” Had henot implored enough over Jeanne, and had it not got him only deeper into theconfusion of love’s miserable shadow? The decision was Alice’s to make; she madeit and left, lovingly, longingly, reluctantly, but necessarily, on June 26. Shewould regret it.Crowley could now concentrate on his Great Magical Retirement. “I was thus ableto enter into direct communication with the realities of existence instead ofconducting them by means of symbolic gestures.”4 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt369]He intended to go “all out” to penetrate the mysteries of the Grade of Magus.But first, he had to face a most unexpected new self who emerged through hisveins, biceps, and mind.In New York he had taken six “doses” of the “Elixir of Life and the UniversalMedicine”: his designation for preparations emanating from the Juventutemalchemical operations. “And then the fun began!”5[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt370]To his utter amazement, Crowley found himself erupting with physical energy. Hehad always enjoyed impressive physical flexibility and power of endurance, buthad never been physically strong in the “arm-wrestling” or heavy-lifting sense.Now he found himself wielding an axe like a Viking stalking the forest thatlined the lakeside, making short work of felling a tree and trimming atwenty-two-foot log. Stories quickly spread among locals of the “hermit withsuperhuman strength.”6 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt371] Such was his activitythat Evangeline Adams dispatched to him an indignant letter after neighborscomplained that he’d dammed the lake and obstructed traffic! He might havecursed the lake, but he never dammed it. He just made a port to tie up hiscanoe, which he used to explore the lake and its islands and for fishing andreading. Not only was the man’s body affected by what he considered the actionof the magick, but his mind also changed. He felt like a boy again, all action,all vivid hope, with intellectual pursuits a bore, and reading a drag. He made acontemporary note on July 6 concerning a transformation that lasted some threeweeks.The Juventus experiment must be regarded as absurdly successful. I have all thesymptoms of sixteen and even earlier—great physical restlessness and appetitefor hard, athletic work—also the vague aspirations and heedlessness oftime—utter disinclination for mental work, too, as at that age. Further, I seemto have created in my aura all the conditions of my own youth. I spend the dayplaying at camping out; I sail a canoe, I explore islands, I build breakwaters&c &c. I am living almost entirely on milk, yet I have no tendency to get fat,have indeed got much thinner. But the mental lassitude and devil-may-careishnessis very marked indeed. Writing letters is a bore. I have also quite the boy’ssex feeling. I think it is well I did only six operations, or I might havewanted a wet-nurse and a toy train!7 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt372]He had been “playing with fire” and learned a life lesson, for what comes upmust come down. But before he did, Crowley spiced up the physical with thepsychedelic.DR. CROWLEY THE NIGHT-TRIPPERHis next conflagration was purely symbolic, though entirely natural. Three daysbefore the Battle of the Somme was launched in northern France with more thanthirty thousand British, German, and French troops killed or wounded in a singleday of hell, American holidaymakers wandered balmily about Pasquaney, andAleister Crowley took two hundred drops of peyote in a chocolate basepreparation and proceeded to “trip” his way more or less gently through thesummer’s evening. It was June 28, 1916.As the clarity and burgeoning energy of the Lophophora cactus’s activeingredient began to transform Crowley’s powers of vision into the resonantlymagical realm, he gazed, and gazed profoundly, at a great tree he had cut down.Every part of it glowed with significance: a crystalline focus linked directly,indissolubly to the poet’s vigorous inner fire, the invisible fire of spiritualperception that heals the rift between subject and object. The sight of the log,no, the log itself, opened in his mind as the peyote cactus wave opened doors ofperception.The fork of the tree: Was it not truly marvelous, “like unto the thighs of aGoddess”? He lifted the thighs onto a stone: elemental. And was there notanother trunk, also with a fork, but smaller: A divine Phallus, longing for itspurpose? This he placed between the thighs, and then by “magick art,” the onethat made primordial man free, the gift from heaven of man’s red fire, heenflamed “this giant copulation.”8 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt373] Oh what adeep, blood red that was, the feathered ash of volcanic creation, theshimmering, glittering red of the Scarlet Woman alive in lustful knowledge. Onemight think of Jim Morrison’s prophetic wish uttered over half a century later:“We need great, golden copulations.”9 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt374] Did ittake two world wars and the fear of a third to make this little step in theUnited States?As the flames kissed and caressed the glowing symbol in the warm, close,intimate evening, “the Phallus became as the head of a great serpent, even theeye and ear marked aright, and he visibly taking pleasure in his kisses to thatmighty Vulva. Last he fell exhausted, and the head being burnt through, I diderect the shaft against that mighty Love; then they glowed and flamed rightgleefully together; even unto this hour.” The hour was 10:30 p.m. Soon thestars’ silver life: the web of heaven.Then I realized the date today: it is June 28, 2016.He awoke, a century ago, early Thursday morning, took breakfast at five, andfound that he was still in the mood, as was the previous evening’s creation.“The great copulation is still glowing red, the Phallus almost eaten throughbelow the glans, yet still erect and joyous.”10 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt375]All senses of color intensified, the idea lived and breathed like flesh to thespark of touch. Crowley had found his symbol for all he stood for: Man, erectand joyous, giving all for all to give; a mighty hot love for the god and thegoddess. For Crowley, incarnate cock of the gods, the suppression of Man’s TrueWill was the cause of the orgy of blood in Europe. Misdirected energy of lovebecame violence: passions thwarted, hatred born. He was in the war, but not ofit. And that part of him that was in it, even independently of himself, wasabout to bite back at him with a vengeance.ANOTHER CROWLEY, ANOTHER PLACEThe trouble with being a legend is that the legend has a life of its own. Suchis the life of the star on Earth.“I enclose for your notice a long article in the Rheinisch-Westfalische Zeitungof 29 June,” began a letter about propaganda in the neutral Netherlandsdispatched on June 30 to Consul General Ernest Maxse (1863–1943) at Rotterdam’sBritish consulate, Calandstraat 24, by the British Daily Mail’s newcorrespondent in Holland, Charles Tower. “It is inconceivable,” wrote Tower,“that Crowley should have been permitted to come to London. . . . He has alsohad in past years a fairly odiferous moral reputation.”By July 11 the letter had reached the foreign office, where one official wroteto another, “I have seen one or more of the Crowley articles, in the ContinentalTimes I think. As the HO [home office] had a copy of 9117 [filing code forinternal Crowley enquiries] perhaps they would also like a copy of Mr. Towers’sreminiscences of Crowley’s savoury [sic] past.”11[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt376] The official suggested getting details from thehome office. “Some spicey [sic] past history in the hands of Captain Gaunt mightbe used to show up this renegade to the American public. We should also like tofind out if there is any truth in the story of his visit to London.”According to journalist and author Roger Hutchinson, who investigated relevantfiles, the home office received a letter on July 18 from Foreign Office MinisterThomas Wodehouse Legh, the 2nd Baron Newton, saying that Foreign Secretary SirEdward Grey had instructed him to send Towers’s letter for the “confidentialinformation” of Mr. Secretary Samuel (Home Secretary, Herbert Louis, 1stViscount Samuel). “Sir Edward Grey would be glad to be placed in possession ofany facts in regard to the past history of Mr. Crowley which may be in thepossession of the police.” The home secretary duly put New Scotland Yard on thejob.On August 26, Detective Inspector Herbert Fitch informed his superintendent that“it appears that the alleged visit by Crowley is merely a piece of bluff on hispart to obtain money and cheap notoriety.” Superintendent P. Quinn then senttheir full report on Crowley up to 1916. It contained the story (inaccuratelystated) of the “widow’s £200,”*118 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft118] as well aspolice observation of the Rites of Eleusis public performances of 1910. We alsolearn from it that in April 1914 “information was received by the police thatCrowley was committing certain acts of indecency in the presence of females, ina room occupied by him at 2, The Avenue Studios, 76 Fulham Road, where he wasvisited by a woman named Waddell.” There was “a kind of service at which incensehad been burnt.” The report also mentions a letter of complaint to the directorof prosecutions from a Parisian correspondent over an issue of Crowley’s“magazine” The Equinox. As the book was priced over five shillings, no actionwas taken (an intriguing detail—you wouldn’t want the servants reading it!).Quinn continued the somewhat vacuous report with a letter from the Mayfair, 174Bond Street, saying a representative of theirs had returned from New York whereCrowley “was not doing very much work in New York, but was closely associatedwith a woman of the fortune telling class [Evangeline Adams].” The reportproceeded from this devastating revelation to the Statue of Liberty incident ofJuly 1915.The report went by Home Office Under Secretary of State to the foreign office onSeptember 13, 1916, for Sir Edward Grey’s information. A minister named Newtonadded a note on September 14: “Send a copy to Captain Gaunt (by bag) for suchuse as he may be able to make of the information at any suitable opportunity.Truly the Germans are unfortunate in their selection of British subjects tofurther their propagandist ends!” He added, “Should not A. Crowley be notifiedto the Passport Department, permit Office, &c., in case he should attempt tocome here, or having got here, to leave again?” “MWK” also added to the“Confidential” report: “If it goes to Captain Gaunt (as I think it should) hemust be cautioned not to give his source of information in any way. I think wecan trust his discretion and certainly inform Passport and Permit authorities assuggested.”Thirty-four years later, Gaunt informed Crowley’s coexecutor John Symonds thathe “went over to London and had a long talk with Basil Thomson at Scotland Yardand I preached ‘Let him [Crowley] alone, I have got a complete line on him andalso the Fatherland.’”12 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt377] He obviously rememberedthe report but not the facts. He should doubtless have said that he had a linethrough Crowley on the Fatherland, but there were doubtless aspects of Gaunt’sknowledge and activities unknown to us. He certainly never used any of thereport to blacken Crowley in the latter’s lifetime, which he had good reason fordoing had it not become reasonably clear that Crowley had his uses.All this to-ing and fro-ing of paperwork took place in London while Crowleyunderwent his Great Magical Retirement in Bristol, New Hampshire. In early Julyhe was having weird dreams, often with horrific elements. He might have had agood “trip” in his conscious mind, but his unconscious was throwing up all kindsof material, from the optimistic to the sadistic. The dreams were as colorful asoccasional hallucinatory effects of mescaline, and perhaps there was a relationbetween them and his taking Anhalonium lewinii (as the peyote cactus was stillcalled). His imagination was certainly more colorful than usual.On July 3, Crowley concluded the Magus initiation was “utterly unlike allothers. For one thing, it takes up one’s whole life. One is puzzled; becauseChokmah is Masloth, right away from [the] planets.”13[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt378] Crowley was reflecting on the planetary andtarotic attributions of the Qabalist’s Tree of Life glyph as understood by theGolden Dawn.“Masloth” refers to the sphere of influence of Chokmah—or Hokmah, Hebrew for“wisdom.” Hokmah is the second sephira, the second divine emanation afterKether, the “crown,” in God’s Self-projection. On the Tree of Life, Hokmah isthe sephira corresponding to the grade of Magus: the direct source of theMagus’s wisdom. Luminous Hokmah radiates, and the sphere of Hokmah’s influenceis in Masloth, the “Heaven of Assiah” (recall Christ’s dictum “the kingdom ofheaven is nigh and within you”). In Qabalistic theory, Assiah is the sphere ofaction: the material world, on which the Magus may, through Wisdom, effect hiswill. Masloth is the zodiac, the starry heaven, wherein Masloth disposes theforms of things derived from God’s Wisdom. Thus Masloth is, as Crowley noted,“right away from the planets.” Hokmah’s sphere of influence went beyond theordinary determinants of his conscious mind.Crowley had in mind his visionary experience with “The Cry of the Sixth Aethyrwhich is called MAZ” that took place at Ben-S’Rour, Algeria, on December 10,1909. Between 7:40 and 9:40 p.m., he had “entered” consciousness of thatparticular inner-plane aethyr and been granted advanced knowledge pertaining tothe grade of Magus (see Liber 418), though at the time he was insufficientlyadept to grasp its import.14 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt379] Now that he wasbeing initiated, he found its implications dizzying.On July 4 an insight came to him that helped to make sense of the topsyturvyworld he’d experienced since arriving in New York in 1914. By gematria, Chokmah(or “Hokmah”) is 73. He decided a “Chokmah” day was 73 Earth days, so countedmultiples of 73 to work out essential stages in the initiation. This insightcame parallel to his calling the key women involved by animal titles. Thus, fromleaving England to meeting the Cat and Snake “Officers” (a preliminary silenceand solitude) was three times 73 days. The Cat Officer was with him three times73 days. He was essentially alone for one Chockmah day before meeting theMonkey, who had, to date, been with him one Chokmah day. Funnily enough, thedays do work out more or less in the main, and his magical progress up to LeahHirsig’s taking her place in his life can be so measured up to a point, as longas one does not want absolute precision or mind a few anomalies. One has a senseof Crowley’s acute inner disorientation in this matter and the concrete will tofind the way through it.The tendency to cross planes from occult symbolism to events on Earth is not atall illicit in magick, which is, after all, based on the Hermetic principle “Asabove, so below,” but there is every danger of being carried away, as Crowleyknew only too well. Nevertheless, one suspects this cross-symbol multiverse ofmultiplying multiple correspondences, encouraged by Qabalah, and the tendency ofthe mind to connect meaningful series, reached a point where skepticism mighthave been applied more assiduously when it came to Crowley’s receiving on July11 another message from accountant C. S. Jones (formerly “Frater Nemo” = No one)in Vancouver. This time the Magus cottoned on to what Jones had hinted atearlier when Crowley had “a blind fit on” arriving at Bristol. Jones’s messagecame as another signal.During the fortnight after the peyote trip Crowley had reflected deeply on thevision of the Sixth Aethyr. His conclusion: “A Magus must burn up the whole ofhis karma. As a Master of the Temple he is all-Receptiveness; as a Magusall-Activity. True, he pours out Himself in a certain mould or form according toHis Original Nature. But this Nature has been masked by karma. This issymbolized in Liber 418 by the burning of the Book T. to ashes.”15[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt380]Liber 418 is the record of Crowley’s access tothe thirty aethyrs, first in Mexico in 1900, afterward in the Algerian desert in1909, culminating in his own emergence from the Abyss as Master of the Temple.It is interesting that at the moment of receiving Jones’s news of successfulemergence from the Abyss as 8° = 3▫, Crowley decides the event “removes a bar tomy full grade of 9° = 2▫.” Crowley wasn’t likely to tolerate his bright pupilfrom doing anything but following him!The Book of the Law had spoken of “one” that “cometh after” (AL III: 47). This“one” would discover the “Key of it all,” and Jones’s probationer’s motto was“Achad,” meaning “One.” So was Achad the one coming after the Beast? If Jonescame after, he was following, and you can’t follow something that is not ahead.Naturally, Crowley was ahead of the process, though proud of Jones’s achievementwith Crowley’s method.THE BOOK TCrowley’s problems with assuming the grade cannot be grasped without attentionto the “Cry of the Sixth Aethyr,” which, out of context, appearsincomprehensible gibberish.The message from the consciousness pertaining to the aethyr introduced itsaudience to the “Three Schools of Magick” (white, yellow, and black). Thesewere, symbolically, the three Magi who followed the star to the birthplace ofthe Child. The Black School is that of pure skepticism. “For the Black Brotherslift not up their heads thus far into the Holy Chokmah, for they were alldrowned in the great flood, which is Binah [sephira of Understanding], beforethe true vine could be planted on the holy hill of Zion. . . . And although I betruth, yet do they call me rightly the God of Lies, for speech is twofold, andtruth is one.”16 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt381]“None shall pass by me except he slay me, and this is the curse, that, havingslain me, he must take my office and become the maker of illusions, the greatdeceiver, the setter of snares, he who baffleth even them that haveunderstanding. For I stand on every path and turn them aside from the truth bymy words, and by my magick acts.” Moses, Buddha, Lao-tzu, Krishna, and Jesus andOsiris and Mohammed “all attained to the grade of Magus, and therefore were theybound with the curse of Thoth. But, being guardians of the truth, they havetaught nothing but falsehood, except unto such as understood; for the truth maynot pass the Gate of the Abyss.”17 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt382]Crowley’s ideas about his karma being burned up and the ash placed in an urncame from a statement from the Sixth Aethyr. “Now I perceive the Temple that isthe heart of this Aethyr, it is an Urn, suspended in the air, without support,above the center of a well. . . . But the Urn is the wonderful thing in all ofthis; it is made of fixed Mercury; and within it are the ashes of the Book Tarot[“T”] which hath been utterly consumed.”Crowley found this corresponded to the following sentence in one of his “HolyBooks,” Liber 156 (verse 16). “Nor shall the aeon itself avail thee in this; forfrom the dust shall a white ash be prepared by Hermes the Invisible.” Heconcluded that the ash was the past karma of the Magus, for “Tarot” is the loreof destiny. Crowley found a symbolic parallel in the Acts of the Apostlesaccount of Paul and Barnabas being recognized as Jupiter and Mercury (Acts14:12; 19:19). This he took for Kether and Hokmah visiting—that is,inspiring—Ephesus, City of Diana (“Vesta,” the Virgin), corresponding to thethird sephira, Binah (Understanding), followed by the worshippers burning theirbooks on magick.“Now it seems that the centre of infinite space is that Urn, and Hadit is thefire that hath burnt up the Book Tarot. For in the book Tarot was preserved allof the wisdom (for the Tarot was called the Book of Thoth [Mercury]) of the Aeonthat is passed. And in the Book of Enoch was first given the wisdom of the NewAeon.”18 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt383]We now come to the purpose, or “Word,” of the Magus-prophet. According toCrowley’s interpretation of the vision, the New Aeon had been hidden for threehundred years because John Dee’s seer, Edward Kelley (1555–1597), hadprematurely wrested the wisdom of the aethyrs and of “Enochian” wisdom andlanguage from the angelic realm. Kelley’s “master,” Martin Luther (meaningKelley was a reformed Christian or “Protestant”), had overthrown the power ofthe Christian Church, but Kelley, the pupil, rebelled against the master becausehe that saw the new Protestant Church would be worse than the old. “But heunderstood not the purpose of his Master, and that was, to prepare the way forthe overthrowing of the Aeon.”“And a voice proceedeth from the Urn: From the ashes of the Tarot who shall makethe Phoenix-wand? . . . And though thou have violated thy mother; thou hast notslain thy father.” The slaying of the “father” is taken by Crowley as theburning up of that which had fathered or brought the adept to the grade: hiskarma, or past actions that caused his destiny to that point. The question wouldbe: How to slay the karma?In the meantime, Crowley experienced self-doubt. Was he fundamentally deluded?Did the gods really have any use for him any more; had they ever? Hiscircumstances in America looked distinctly unfavorable; even the summer weatherwas generally damp and humid. Though he had seen the “phoenix-wand” “rise” fromthe ashes on mescaline on June 28, he remained in a quandary, not knowing whathe could do. What kind of act would “break his karma”? How could he definitivelysever himself from the past?Then something very odd happened.THE BALL OF FIRELet’s hear it from Crowley. The date is Wednesday,*119[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft119] July 12, 1916; the time 5:00 p.m.A storm struck the lake; I went out to put my canoe in safety. Returning, Ifound a father, mother, and child who had taken refuge under my roof. I was wetthrough, and went into the Middle Chamber of the cottage to change my clothes. Ihad just got the clean shirt on, and was stooping for the trousers[knickerbockers], when a globe of fire burst a few inches from my right foot. Aspark sprang to the middle joint of the middle finger of my left hand.19[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt384]The phenomenon is not unknown to science, though it is still not fullycomprehended. It goes by the name “ball lightning,” and in case you mightconsider the event a curio of Crowley’s overstimulated imagination, or that heimmediately jumped to conclusions about his experience, we can show that Crowleymade serious efforts to ascertain scientific knowledge about it and to make hisown contribution thereto. We know this thanks to discoveries made recently byCrowley scholar and biographer Richard Kaczynski, aided by Charles Greifensteinand Earle Spamer of the American Philosophical Society.20[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt385] Richard Kaczynski has generously shared hisdiscoveries with me for this project.A letter sent to the New York Times led Crowley into correspondence with tworemarkable men of science. William Sturgis Bigelow (1850–1926) was a brilliantHarvard man who practiced as a surgeon to please his father but enjoyedconsiderably wider interests. One of the first Americans to live in Japan,Bigelow encouraged the Japanese to value their ancient art, eventually donatingsome forty thousand Japanese objects to Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts. LikeCrowley, Bigelow was both epicure and mystic. His ideas on spiritual evolutionmade compatible with science—biology combined with spiritual evolution in termsof cosmic and supracosmic consciousness—informed Bigelow’s book Buddhism andImmortality in 1908. On July 25, Bigelow sent Crowley a list of questions aboutthe phenomenon. It should be observed that the following correspondence tookplace over the period during which Crowley experienced progressive initiation.Happy to communicate with a scientific mind of broad dimensions, Crowley repliedto Bigelow’s questions the following day.Dear Sir:Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.I am obliged by your letter of yesterday, and hasten to reply. I used (by theway) to know a very little about Science, having taken it at Cambridge, England.But the time was too short, and the phenomenon too startling, for me to claimperfect observation. I will, however, answer your questions as best I can,seriatim.1. The colour was violet and ultra-violet, like an arc light, but with muchcrimson in it.2. It did not oscillate, but remained steady for a period which I dare hardlyestimate, and then burst.3.4. The intensity of the radiance makes it hard to answer these two questions[including “Did the surface show waves or ripples?”], but there seemed to be anucleus.5. The shape approximated closely to the spherical.6. It apparently fell, but this may be a subjective or rationalized impression.7. [“If it moved, was it seen to enter the room through an open window orotherwise?”] See 6, also comment, infra.8. [“If it moved, did it seem to follow any draft of air that was in the room atthe time?”] See above.The conditions of the cottage and of the storm were peculiar. At the risk ofbeing tedious, I subjoin a rough sketch. [sketch follows]The Cottage is entirely of wood, except the chimney. There are many treessurrounding it, but they are rather small, except those marked.The climate has been very damp this summer and I have had large log fires everynight in the quite quixotic attempt to combat the humidity. The storm brokewithout rain, and awoke me. I went to the balcony to watch the lightning, whichkept the lake vividly illuminated. I then saw a squall travelling rapidly South,and rushed to the lake to put my canoe in safety. While doing this the squallstruck me. I could not have been out in it for 30 seconds, but was wet throughto the skin. I went into the room D, stripped, dried myself, and had just put ona flannel shirt when the phenomenon occurred. My hair was probably still fairlywet. I was directly between the chimney and the globe, which appeared close tomy right foot. I was seated, bending, just reaching for some knickerbockers.The above is a fairly complete account of those facts which appear to mesuggestive. Now I am anxious to have an opinion on these two theories.1. Could the lightning have struck the chimney and passed through me, formingthe globe on issuing, or passed by me?2. Could the globe have been formed spontaneously in the room? The chimney andits vicinity being exceedingly dry and the rest of the cottage exceedingly wet,it seems to me as if that part might have been charged rather like a Leyden jar.I should be extremely indebted to you if you would comment upon these points. Iam already obliged to you for referring me to the authorities, but this lakesideis not well furnished with Text Books of Science, and I must wait till my returnto New York.Love is the Law, Love under Will. Yours very sincerely,Aleister Crowley21 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt386]On August 7, Bigelow would send Crowley’s letter to Professor Elihu Thomson,who, in the meantime, received a letter direct from Crowley.image [images/9781620556313_057.jpg]Fig. 22.4. Adams Cottage floor plan, drawn by Crowley for Prof. W. S. Bigelow in1916, identifying the scene of “ball lightning” that entered the cottage. (I amgrateful to Richard Kaczynski, the American Philosophical Society, and theO.T.O. for sharing this image with the author.)Born in Manchester, England, inventor and electrical engineer Elihu Thomson(1853–1937) was but five when his family migrated to Philadelphia. Thirty yearsof successfully registering electricity-related patents made Thomson a nationalleader in the field, and in 1892 his Thomas-Houston Electrical Company mergedwith the Edison General Electric Company to form the General Electric Company,which thrives. He received a doctorate of science from Harvard in 1899, havingalready received a Ph.D. from Tufts College and an honorary degree from Yale. In1909, Thomson was the first to receive the Edison Medal for prolific inventionfrom the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. His house at Swampscott,Massachusetts, is now a U.S. historic landmark. Fascinated by what Crowley hadwitnessed, Thomson wrote to him on July 28. Crowley replied three days later.I am obliged by your letter of the 28th inst., and hasten to reply.1. The thunderstorm had been violent for some 10 to 15 minutes.2. A tremendous bang, like the bursting of a bomb, not like thunder.3. I dare not estimate. I was very startled. But not very long.4. Apparently it fell, but this may be subjective or rationalized impression.(Pardon!) 6. Between 4:15 and 4:30 p.m. Very dark with low black clouds and rainalmost a solid mass. A fierce wind blowing.5. [sic] Like an arc light, very bright.7. See 1, supra.8. Close to floor, possibly on it.I wrote an elaborate account with sketches for Prof W. S. Bigelow 56 BeaconStreet Boston Mass I would so as much now, but am working day and night onseveral important articles. Pray forgive me if I refer to you as above; no doubthe will be glad to confer.I believe the globe was formed spontaneously in the room itself. Is thispossible? You would oblige me much by any information on the theory offormation.22 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt387]Bigelow then wrote to Thomson on August 7, 1916.Dear Prof. Thomson:Pray pardon my delay in answering yours of Aug. 2nd. It reached me at the otherend of the state. . . . I send herewith his letter and my questions. His letterseems clear, all but the first and last lines, which with the odd red stamp onthe first page, suggest that he may possibly be some kind of a crank. [Bigelowrefers to the Thelemic greetings “Do what thou wilt &c” and “Love is the Law&c,” and the O.T.O. correspondence sigil]I am very glad to hear that you have the subject in hand and hope that, when youhave got far enough, you will communicate your results to the Academy. Of courseyou know the literature of the subject better than I do, but a case occurredsome thirty years ago at Beverly Farms in the house of one of my own family,where, during a heavy thunderstorm, a luminous ball floated in through an openkitchen window, moved slowly, like a soap-bubble, toward the range, where itshrank up and disappeared without exploding. The range had a water-back.Unfortunately the cook was the only person who saw it, but she told a straightstory of what she had seen.Mr. Crowley asks two questions, which I have taken the liberty of telling him Ihave referred to you.Yours sincerely,Wm Sturgis Bigelow23 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt388]Crowley wrote to Bigelow again on August 8, explaining the O.T.O. sigil,presuming Bigelow to be a Freemason.Dear Sir, and I presume Brother,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Thanks for your letter of the 7th. Yes, the red seal is super-Masonic [meaning a“High Grade” Masonic Order], pertaining to a degree—the ninth—in an order ofwhich the seventh degree corresponds to the 33° a. & a. [Ancient & Accepted“Scottish” Rite] I venture to enclose a pamphlet, as you appear interested. Itis all part of a movement which promises to be very large. There are branchesalmost everywhere except U.S.A. where people don’t want to be, but to have.To get back to our lightning, it might interest you to know that I was struck byit once. I was about 18. I forget the exact year. I had been climbing the PillarRock of Emmerdale in Cumberland, got soaked in a violent hailstorm with thunderand lightning and set out to cross the Pillar Mountain on my way back toWasdale. On the ridge of this mountain is a sheep fence of wire. I crossed it,and then turned to watch the lightning striking the uprights—quite smallflashes, dozens of them one after the other. Jupiter (seeing my ice axeprobably) made a dash at me. I felt a shock—luckily I was wet through—and satdown hard. Then I broke the world’s record back to the hotel!I remember about the lightning on board ships now you recall it. (I was achemist with Murray Thompson, Herbert Jackson, Remsen, Ramsay, Collie, Travers &others, whom you may know, and did a little general physics as well.) I wasreally convinced that the ball formed in the room; it could hardly havetravelled unseen. The chimney was quite the only other hypothesis; and eventhen—well, can a globe, as a globe, pass through matter as dense as brick?Love is the law Love under Will Yours very truly & fraternally, AleisterCrowley24 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt389]Crowley was still at the Adams Cottage, Bristol, on August 23 when he wrote oncemore to Elihu Thomson. Having greeted Thomson in the Thelemic manner, Crowleyconfessed:I feel like the chief of sinners at the Day of Judgement in addressing thisletter to you; but you have only to tell me to start again with some scraps ofpaper, and sealing-wax in my coat-sleeve.I have done no electricity since 1898, and all I remember is to distinguishbetween Kelvin, Sylvanus (with a “p”*120 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft120]) andyourself. But I am mightily intrigued over this globular lightning, and I shouldlike to put forward a theory, probably absurd, which lends itself to possiblereproduction of the phenomenon in the laboratory.I assume that you have seen my letter to Prof. W. S. Bigelow.We have (a) a very wet cottage (b) a very dry chimney. (I am aware that wet onlymeans more water, and dry less water; but I have been reading alchemy & suchstuff, and I still conceive of “fire” and “water” in the curious old sense.Norman Collie,†121 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft121] of all people, by the way,was very keen on alchemy in the days when we climbed rocks together.) We have(c) an atmosphere charged with electricity of enormous voltage.image [images/9781620556313_058.jpg]Fig. 22.5. Letter from Crowley to Professor Elihu Thomson, August 23, 1916,concerning electricity and ball lightning. Note the O.T.O. letterhead. (I amgrateful to Richard Kaczynski, the American Philosophical Society, and theO.T.O. for sharing this image with the author.)Now this electricity in (a) gets comfortably to ground. In (b) it does not quiteknow what to do. Wet clothes and legs come into (b). It can’t exactly spark—noconductor available; so it forms a globe about a drop of the newly introducedmoisture.I have put this in lay language; but you will understand the idea. Is it quitemad?Love is the Law, Love under Will. Yours very sincerely, Aleister Crowley25[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt390]Despite a plethora of theories to explain ball lightning, its true natureremains a mystery to science. Crowley had no doubt that he had witnessed anatural phenomenon, but this did not exhaust its possibilities of meaning. “Itis a remarkable fact that physical phenomena of an appropriate characterfrequently accompany a spiritual event.”26 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt391]Crowley wrote in his Confessions of how heartened he felt by Prof. Thomson’sopen-minded account (currently lost) of the curious nature of electricalphenomena, going so far as to give Crowley hope that one day soon science wouldstart to perceive, even without knowing it, the suprarational point of view of“Neschamah” (spiritual mind) over the restrictions, often contradictory ofordinary “reason,” known to Qabalists as the “ruach,” or conventional mind ofdualism. To mention quantum physics here is too much of a contemporary cliché toadumbrate further on this theme. To paraphrase Crowley, while it may be thatmind is a manifestation of matter, it is also reasonable to suppose matter maybe a manifestation of mind.For himself, Crowley took the experience, on account of timing with regard tohis initiation, and its almost intimate character as a sign that the mastersstill needed him, that the initiation was real. He compared it to an incident inChina in 1905 when he was thrown from a horse thirty feet down an incline andescaped without a scratch. That occasion too had coincided with a longinitiation into realizing the hopelessness of reason, a period characterized asthe “Abyss,” a loss of anchorage in reason and surrender of acquired means ofknowing, before he finally experienced “the knowledge and conversation of theHoly Guardian Angel.”Crowley had somehow suspected that death would be the outcome of the initiation.“This then is wrong,” he confided to his special diary of initiation (The Urn).“It seems to me as if this Initiation were taking place ‘elsewhere,’ i.e., notin my consciousness at all. It is obviously too big for my human consciousness;yet its results must work down through that.”27 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt392]Was not “Masloth” Wisdom’s sphere of influence—the earthly heavens—and did theynot open to form a solid mass to descend on the lake that night?Despite the globular reassurance, Crowley still felt utterly inadequate as apersonality to the demands of the grade. “There is utter impotence on allplanes. This has persisted through the whole period, save for short spells, whenI have been more or less normal. But always I slip back into the state for whichI find idiocy an adequate and even euphemistic term. I do not in the least failto understand the grade; I am simply unable to act. It is no good making up mymind to do anything material; for I have no means. But this would vanish if Icould make up my mind. I am as it were inhibited from everything. I am temptedfor example to crucify a toad, or copulate with a duck, sheep, or goat, or set ahouse on fire or murder someone with the idea—a perfectly good magical idea, ofcourse—that some supreme violation of all the laws of my being would break mykarma, or dissolve the spell that seems to bind me. And I cannot do it, because(chiefly) I have no faith that it would actually do so.”28[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt393]He recalled a bizarre dream of February 15, 1915, that seemed to necessitatemaking the lion “very dead indeed.” That dream message was a cryptic answer tothe question of “how to fix the volatile,” where the lion symbolized the seed oflife. But Crowley had cross-symbolized.The theme of the sermon [given in a bare New York room by four or five men] wasmostly that “he” Christ or lion or elixir or something must be turned completelyover, and must be made very dead indeed. The book [“Galeth” in the dream,supposed Bible] was full of promises that he would come back, and he—on thewhole—is not wanted back.29 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt394]Crowley had remembered a “pig toy” on the street, one of those things thatvibrate, then suddenly flip themselves over on mechanical hind legs, ending up“lifeless”: an overturning process.But then, was not the “Urn” of the Sixth Aethyr suspended in air and made of“fixed mercury”?—mercury made solid, cold as a fish, to steal the life, orpassion, of the lion. To fix, or secure into suspension, the “volatile”—thelively but unstable alchemical new creation—it must attain perfect balance: its“word” free. Was it then necessary to identify with the Urn itself, not with itscontents? To bring the lion—or old self, the “father” or self-will—to symbolicash? The Simonian Gnostics had identified the burning bush that confronted Moseswith the absolute giving of the self in love. And had not the Paris Workings ofJanuary and February 1915 led a surprised Crowley to identify Christ withMercury—with the serpents of transformation on either side of the Hermeticstaff, like the two thieves (Mercury!) about the cross?Crowley still did not feel that he had cracked the mystery of the grade, thoughit might seem to be staring him in the face.One thing had become clear to him on the afternoon of July 12. He should nolonger “degrade” himself by working at anything save “the one thing: to preachmy Law, either directly or by Art. In short, no more Vanity Fair, no more StuartX, no more Miss Adams.” He added the cryptic comment, “As Dante said to me atthe National Arts Club, ‘Canst not thou go into the street, and starve?’”30[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt395]Dante Alighieri (1265–1321) was of course the great Italian poet who neverstopped loving his ideal, Beatrice Portinari, even after her death at the age oftwenty-four. He used to see her in the street, at a distance, and even thoughshe married another, he knew her to be his “salvation,” image of purity, andincarnation of the Love spiritual of the troubadours, his guide, his staffthrough all levels of creation. Why the National Arts Club at 15 Gramercy Park,New York? That was where Jeanne Foster took him, a place Crowley associated withfake artists, hangers-on, poets of the nonideal, the socially acceptable,infinitely conformable, clubbable denizens of the mutual admiration society. Hewrote about his reaction with a few strokes of “imagist” idiom for the January1918 edition of the International, under the title “A Poetry Society—inMadagascar?”The Poetry Society. St. Vitus,St. Borborygmus, aid! The thin screams fellAnd rose like spasms in some hothouse hellPeopled by scraggier harpies than Cocytus.Dull dirty décolletées dilettante!I sickened to the soul; above the babbleOf the cacophonous misshapen rabble,Rose like a cliff the awful form of Dante.Colossally contemptuous, in airyStature the iron eyes of AlighieriBurn into mine; their razor lightnings carveMy capon soul. “What dost thou here?” they said:“Art thou not even worthy to be dead?Canst thou not go into the street, and starve?”Better die in the streets than surrender Beatrice for the company of the fakes;for there are no art fakes, only fake artists. Crowley was not one of them.On July 15 he ignored the recent rainfall and lit a bonfire. While lighting ithe felt inspired by Psalm 40. “I waited patiently upon IHVH; and he inclinedunto me, and heard my cry. . . . He brought me up also out of the horrible pit,and out of the miry clay and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.. . . Thus,” he noted, “both rest and motion are assured.” Crowley too wouldpray while he waited. And that “miry clay”—was that not America, he wondered, asraindrops dripped from the trees about him, threatening his fire? There washope. “And hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God.” Now maybehe would write a new psalm, or new something. And to his delight, the bonfiredefied the rain and “went splendidly of itself from the start.”31[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt396]The next day he wrote an excellent article—“Good Hunting.”32[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt397] Indeed it is a great relief to read apart-refreshed Crowley writing about something he really cares about: not Germansubmarines, but Love, Death, theater, cult, and religion. It begins with agentle swipe into the nature of tragedy and comedy; it’s all down to hunting.Our ancestors got their jollies and their sorrows from stalking wild beasts. Andthe humor was the rendering of the mighty into the foolish: the beast looked sogrand, but we, we were watching with our flint-axes, and we had him! Andeveryone laughs because we’ve brought home dinner and the tribe is happy. Whatheroism! Worth a song!Every great drama is a hunt of some kind, whether comedic or tragic depends onwhether you brought the meat or the “meat” took a liking to the hunter and washungry. Oh dear, and then the tragedy: no food to eat, all tears!—while thetribe across the valley are laughing because their hunt was successful. It’s afine analogy and it works. Crowley then goes on to discuss what happened to aculture where the humor of the god dressed up, and served to die—eaten by thegrateful tribe—became a wail of sorrow, when the great hunt of life became theimage of man’s existential failure. What if man were perennial victim? Always,for life hunts him, as does love and death and he cannot escape. Ah me! It’sBuddhism: everything is sorrow. And the man of grief, acquainted with sorrows.All dressed up, only to die: the cloak, the crown of thorns, the weeping women.Only through death can man live; to join in the death of the savior and expectnaught from the world. And so Crowley takes us beyond the tragedy to hisThelemic solution, where Death is a joy of utter love in dissolution and life tobe lived with fervor and laughter, for eternal life is. “Good Hunting” marked anew beginning, and it did not stop there.But first there was the business of burning up the karma. Crowley finallysettled on something he felt he could do that, at least if anything went wrong,only he would know. He took a leaf, or rather a verse, out of the very firstissue of The Equinox. There was a poem, very effective too, called “The WizardWay” that also explores the great, and perhaps only, themes of Love and Deathand hunting.He had crucified a toadIn the basilisk abodeMuttering the runes averseMad with many a mocking curse.33 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt398]Crowley doubtless had Revelation 6:13–14 in mind also.And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon,and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto thekings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of thatgreat day of God Almighty.Crowley was mad all right, mad desperate to rid himself of something inside himthat was making assumption of the grade of Magus impossible: something in hispast, in his upbringing, and what had made that upbringingpossible—Christianity.Crowley had with him several volumes of J. G. Frazer’s interminable study inreligious myth and anthropology, The Golden Bough. Frazer was keen to show thatthe core myth of the Christian faith—that is to say, what constitutesChristianity’s appeal to the subconscious mind—was an inheritance of remoteantiquity concerning a god that must die and rise again, or a human figure whomust be dressed as a god, slain, and eaten as a magical rite: the religious“substitute” who as an offering to the gods, or god, undergoes what wouldotherwise be coming to the tribe. To avoid pain, judgment, death, sickness, cropfailure, or other baleful happenings, a magical “switch” is made where a figureis dressed like a king, is treated as a king, and then slain, either as aking-god or priest. It is basic magical substitution, of linking things bylikeness or symbolic correspondence: “sympathetic magic.” Thus, a crown means“king.” So if you “take the crown,” you become the king. The magic is in thecrown and must be guarded; kings are ultimately disposable (similarly,presidents in a republic). In ancient Jewish tradition, for example, a scapegoattakes on the sin of the people as part of atonement rituals. The story ofAbraham all but slaying his son Isaac in Genesis suggests the hapless “goat” wasformerly the favored son of the tribal leader, offered to secure the favorablewill of the deity. The ramifications are endless.Frazer explored rites and traditions of primitive cultures and found similarthemes enacted as magical rites throughout the world. For Crowley, hisscientific approach to mythology—impossible for our medieval ancestors—explainedmuch of the misery he encountered when after his preacher father’s death in 1888he was placed in the hands of religious maniacs whose “mania” was notparticularly noticeable to mid-to-late era Victorians. Young Crowley, and hisgeneral culture, had by degrees fallen victim, so to speak, of the cult of the“dying God.” Thus salvation was bought through suffering and death, throughidentifying with the slain deity in symbol, and/or in a compensatory afterlife.When we add to this the realization that Crowley also had with him at LakePasquaney a copy of Swiss psychologist Carl Jung’s hot-off-the-press,cutting-edge Psychology of the Unconscious (1916), and that Crowley was also a“natural” empathizer with Nietzsche’s philosophy that the dying God was deadindeed, along with Nietzsche’s famous dictum, “the god on the cross is a curseon life,” and we can start to see where Crowley was coming from.Nietzsche had seen a culture haunted by the specter of nihilism, brought aboutthrough decline in authority of religious dogma; Crowley also. Crowleyunderstood that our species is psychologically and essentially disposed to bereligious and that nihilism is a disease of the intellect subject to reason,tending to afflict students withdrawn from nature into the cloistered mind, orthe acutely depressed. Alternative “rational” faiths may be embraced—socialism,for example (for humankind feels the need to believe in something)—or thecomplete reaction: fundamentalism; that is, denial of any crisis in religiousauthority whatsoever.Crowley had had more than enough of fundamentalism. It had rendered his mother’spoint of view absurd and was shored up by outmoded beliefs about the universe,laced with aggressive, or suppressed-aggressive, philistinism. Because we nowknow that the sun does not die at night, or have to be resurrected in themorning by prayer (thanksgiving), it followed that spiritual religion shouldtake a step forward with evolution of thought. He believed the passing of“aeons” simply marked a stage in awareness and ability and used the analogy of achild going from the stage of sucking to the evolved stage of eating. Hissyncretic system of Thelema offered, he believed, recovered principles requiredto mark this evolution. It did not mean an absolute destruction of what precededit, but rather a fresh point of view, an enlarged picture appropriate to themind enlightened by new knowledge. It marked a return to the perceived ancientprinciple of the Magi, that religion and science were one and the same. ForCrowley, magick was an ancient fact; a, or even the way of life offering a pathof initiation into truth according to capacity, optimistically and generously,but not foolishly defined.Crowley believed in sacramentalism, in symbolic acts manifesting willedintention. He believed in the hidden power of sex. Why did Christian culturenot? It was the effect of the dying God. Sex was linked to death, the price ofsin. Crowley shared Blake’s view that the figure familiarly known as Jesus was aspiritual liberator, a Magus extraordinaire with a transformative “word” andwith a spiritual conception too far ahead of his time to be tolerated and thathis followers split between those who could deal with it, and those who tried tomake of “it” something in accord with the old formula (of the dying God), orwith other existing or nascent rites of late antiquity. This split manifested inthe Encratite movement that identified sex as evil and which “came over” thechurch, so that by the late third century “real” Christians were those whoeschewed sex, and even women altogether, and those who were not committed to thedoctrine should fear the flames of hell. The distinction made for bigotry andwidespread misery. Furthermore, knowledge (science) came to be regarded withsuspicion, and its subject, Nature, despised.Putting an elevated conception of sex back in to first Rosicrucianism and thenthe culture generally was central to Crowley’s aim. He understood that for thisto happen a profound psychological scotoma operating deep in the world’ssubconscious would have to be overcome. Such was the import of the New Aeon, andhe believed the death throes of the old Aeon would be extremely violent in bothWest and East should spiritual evolution be resisted. He did not have to lookfar to see the evidence. As I write, the BBC is broadcasting “celebrations” ofthe centenary of the Battle of the Somme in 1916. What happened is stilldiscussed in terms of “sacrifice”; the soldiers “died for us that we mightlive.” The dying God is still very much with us, there, and among the suicidebombers who would rather die and kill that they might “live” after theirmurderous “self-sacrifice.”First, Crowley would have to deal with the residuum of the old Aeon in himself,for he had been born and raised before the formal announcement of the Aeon hadbeen made to him in April 1904 in Cairo, when he heard and wrote down the textof The Book of the Law. We might today consider his ritual as either insane orperhaps as personal therapy, like the classic “reject your father” Freudianroutines to help neurotic or melancholic people come out from the shadows ofpast pains, long buried or haunting.STAUROS BATRACHOUCrowley dignified his strange operation with the Greek title above, meaning “theCross of the Frog” (Liber LXX)—though a toad also sufficed. The idea was toidentify the creature with the dying God and then to slay it: a prophetic act ofmagic. The trouble, as I see it, was a certain logical inconsistency. On theprinciple applied, that symbolically killing the atonement-earning Crucifiedwould clear the way for new life, then it would appear the means to effect thenew dispensation or cleansing of karma would itself be an application of thedying God principle, the very principle the rite intended to overthrow! Crowleyprobably saw the parody as sympathetic magic in reverse: to destroy like withlike.It also does not seem to have occurred to him that his sufferings as a youth andafterward had made him what he was, for good and ill. Could he have risen to thegrade without the attendant pains? Again, Crowley would doubtless answer thathaving trod the path, what had contributed to that end, was burned up and donewith; none need follow it. Besides, he felt a necessity to undergo a deliberatemental shakedown, to bring forth his essential, not conditioned nature, and thispeculiar act had the power of being at once absurd and, further in characterwith the grade, contrary to existing nature (the “curse” theme).So, on July 17, 1916, while the four-day Battle of Bazentin Ridge drew to aclose with nearly ten thousand casualties suffered by the British Fourth Army,Crowley composed “the ceremonies proper to the obtaining a familiar spirit of aMercurial nature, as described in the Apocalypse of St. John the Divine, from afrog or toad,”34 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt399] and in particular the ceremonyof the assumption of the curse of the grade of Magus.According to the document, ceremonies would begin about 2:00 a.m. with “theMystery of Conception” with Crowley representing a snake, because frogs are theproper food of snakes. A frog was to be caught in silence and the will affirmedto continue. “The Mystery of Birth,” at about 6:00 a.m., involved keeping thefrog in an ark or chest (representing the “virgin’s womb”) until noon, when the“Mystery of Baptism” called for the chief officer to approach the chest withgold, and frankincense and myrrh if possible, releasing the frog to a quiltcovered by a net and intoning words of baptism in the name of Father, Son, andHoly Ghost and, sprinkling water, naming it Jesus of Nazareth. “The Mystery ofWorship,” on paper at least, involved visiting the frog, asking it to performmiracles while offering words of worship, yet secretly carving a cross tocrucify it.Then we come to the psychological guts of the mystery, the so-called Mystery ofTrial slated for 9:00 p.m.Night being fallen, arrest the frog, accuse him of blasphemy, sedition, and soforth in these words: Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. Lo, Jesusof Nazareth, thou art taken in my snare. All my life long thou hast plagued meand affronted me. In thy name—with all other free souls in Christendom—have beentortured in my boyhood; all delights have been forbidden unto me; all that I hadhas been taken from me, and that which is owed to me they pay not—in thy name.Now, at last, I have thee; the Slave-God is in the power of the Lord of Freedom.Thine hour is come; as I blot thee out from this earth, so surely shall theeclipse pass; and the Light, Life, Love, and Liberty be once more the Law ofEarth. Give thou place to me, O Jesus; thine aeon is passed; the Age of Horus isarisen by the Magick of the Master, the Great Beast that is a Man; and hisnumber is six hundred and three score and six. Love is the law, love under will.[A pause.]I, TΟ MEΓA ΘHPIΟN (“To Mega Therion” = The Great Wild Beast], therefore condemnthee, Jesus the slave-god, to be mocked and spat upon and scourged and thencrucified.35 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt400]Execution of sentence would follow. The victim was then to be mocked.Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. I, the Great Beast, slayingthee, Jesus of Nazareth, the slave-god, under the form of this creature offrogs, do bless this creature in the name of the image [images/img_003.jpg]Father and of the image [images/img_003.jpg] Son and of the image[images/img_003.jpg] Holy Ghost. And I assume unto myself and take into myservice the elemental spirit of this frog, to be about me as a lying spirit, togo forth upon the earth as a guardian to me in my Work for Man; that men mayspeak of my piety and of my gentleness and of all virtues and bring to me loveand service and all material things soever whereof I may stand in need. And thisshall be its reward, to stand beside me and hear the Truth that I utter, thefalse-hood whereof shall deceive men. Love is the law, love under will.Then shalt thou stab the frog to the heart with the Dagger of Art, saying: Intomy hands I receive thy spirit.The unequivocal blasphemy was to be completed at 9:45 p.m. with “the Mystery ofResurrection and Ascension.”Presently thou shalt take down the frog from the cross and divide it into twoparts; the legs shalt thou cook and eat as a sacrament to confirm thy compactwith the frog; and the rest shalt thou burn utterly with fire, to consumefinally the aeon of the accursed one.So mote it be!And this ceremony shalt serve also as a ceremonial assumption of the Curse ofthe Grade of a Magus 9° = 2▫ Aimage [images/dots.jpg]Aimage [images/dots.jpg].image [images/img_004.jpg]It all sounds shocking, and was intended to shock, to reach into Crowley’sunconscious: a deliberate break with the past. How seriously Crowley took it allthough, or even how much of the written text was enacted on the plane of action,or was to be taken as a paradox, is unknown. One might judge the man mad, and ina sense he was, but he had not lost his sense of humor, and that, we may say, iswhat kept him sane.Noting the result of the composition, the intended acquisition of a “familiarspirit,” he wrote that a girl from a village three miles away requested to behis secretary—and she looked toadlike! As is often with Crowley: serious messageplus leg-pull with twinkle. A diary note in The Urn for August 11 suggests thathe may have enacted the rite in purely symbolic terms on the plane of action.“It is rather amusing after Operation of July 17 that I have now a stenographerexactly like a frog to assist me in the ceremonial slaying of Jesus in the[George Bernard] Shaw article.” Writing to C. S. Jones later in the year he saidhe would have to close the letter as “the frog-elemental whom I invoked hasarrived, and I must slay Shaw and the slave god.” The Shaw he had to “slay”referred to the preface of playwright George Bernard Shaw’s Androcles and theLion, just published in New York by Brentano’s, a copy of which Crowley hadtaken to the cottage with him.Shaw’s play about a Christian slave of imperial Rome saved by a lion predictablycaptured Crowley’s interest, but when he read Shaw’s preface, he was astonished.Shaw made it his business to offer his opinion on the Gospels, concluding thatJesus was originally a prophet of socialism, and that the religion that followedhim was largely the work of followers. Jesus, a socialist? Crowley wasn’t havingthat, and he started to tear into Shaw’s string of assumptions with his profoundknowledge of the Bible, a great deal of which he knew in the King James versionby heart.What began as an article soon became a full, book-length treatise on thepredominant religion of the Western world, known in manuscript as Liber 888,which was never published in his lifetime. This is unfortunate as it is aremarkable, truly liberated study, sane, logical, amusing, clearly expressed,and often profound. It is Crowley’s considered view of Christianity, and it isimportant that we consider it.But before we do, an anecdote: one of Crowley’s. Many years ago I was goingthrough his papers in the Warburg Institute and found a hurried note,pencil-written in Crowley’s handwriting. It recorded a brief interchange thattook place when passing George Bernard Shaw by in the streets of London.CROWLEY: “Still posing as George Bernard Shaw?”SHAW: “But I am George Bernard Shaw!”CROWLEY: “Exactly.”Crowley knew his prey."},{"pageContent":"TWENTY-THREEimage [images/9781620556313_099.jpg]Crowley on ChristI believe in Charles Darwin Almighty, maker of Evolution; and in Ernst Haeckel,his only son our Lord Who for us men and for our salvation came down fromGermany: who was conceived of Weissmann, born of Büchner, suffered under duBois-Raymond, was printed, bound, and shelved: who was raised again into English(of sorts), ascended into the Pantheon of the Literary Guide and sitteth on theright hand of Edward Clodd: whence he shall come to judge the thick in the head.I believe in Charles Watts; the Rationalist Press Association; the annual dinnerat the Trocadero Restaurant; the regularity of subscriptions, the resurrectionin a sixpenny edition, and the Book-stall everlasting.AMEN.ALEISTER CROWLEY,“THE CONFESSION OF ST. JUDAS MCCABBAGE”1 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt401]The quotation above appears on day eleven of “John St John,” Crowley’s diary ofa magical retirement spent in Paris in 1908. Pregnant with witty commentaries onspiritual experiences he underwent in the City of Light, the above momentrepresents the tongue-in-cheek intellectual credo of a liberally disposedrationalist and scientific skeptic. But make no mistake, Crowley worked with aconception of God. For him, what we call God is man’s inmost ideal, “Adonai,”man’s innermost fire, and this spiritual center corresponds potentially, if notconsciously, to every aspect of the universe. In theory one can attain “cosmicconsciousness.”Crowley’s idea of pantheism recurred to him on the eleventh day of his Parisianretirement, after practicing raja yoga and reflecting on paintings by Raphaeland Fra Angelico. He noted the “grossness of the Theistic conception” revealedin even great painters’ attempts to express divine being in anthropomorphicimages, concluding, “How infinitely subtler and nobler is the contemplation ofThe Utmost GodHid i’ th’ middle o’ matter.2 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt402]Crowley recognized this “Utmost God” in the traditions of Jesus’s spiritualteaching, but agreed with G. B. Shaw that whatever the founder taughtoriginally, or what he meant by it, followers had twisted it, being in variousdegrees unenlightened or insufficiently initiated as to essentials, symbols, andsubtleties. In his masterwork Magick, Crowley repeated the idea, adding thecritical pearl of gnosis (liberating spiritual knowledge).It [Thelema] is the Law that Jesus Christ, or rather the Gnostic tradition ofwhich the Christ legend is a degradation, attempted to teach; but nearly everyword he said was misinterpreted and garbled by his enemies, particularly bythose who called themselves his disciples. In any case the Aeon was not readyfor a Law of Freedom.3 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt403]The world was not ready. Now, he believed, it was.The “will” that should “be done” was understood by Crowley as the “True Will,”inmost core of every Star. “Do that, and no other shall say nay” (AL I:43). Inhis complex testament The World’s Tragedy (1910), Crowley charged the Protestantreformation with rendering the Christian tradition even more unpalatable thanRoman Catholic medievalism, with paper doctrines of biblical inerrancy,justification by faith alone, forensic atonement, predestination, puritanicalsex phobia, all-masculine God images, materialist notions of the Holy Spirit,heaven and hell, and, above all, its intolerant apocalyptic hysteria, tied towhat Crowley called the “sin complex,” that “there is no health in us,” combinedwith negativity toward much science, sense, and indifference in the face ofNature. His argument was not with whoever began the movement.I therefore hold the legendary Jesus in no wise responsible for the trouble: itbegan with Luther, perhaps, and went on with Wesley: but no matter!—what I amtrying to get at is the religion which makes England to-day a hell for any manwho cares at all for freedom. That religion they call Christianity; the devilthey honour they call God. I accept these definitions, as a poet must do, if heis to be at all intelligible to his age, and it is their God and their religionthat I hate and will destroy.4 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt404]It has suited Crowley’s enemies to ignore the all-important qualificationsadumbrated above, even when they have cared to consult the relevant texts.However, Crowley was more aware than most that every repressive doctrine had itssource in a biblical text. The Bible excused doing horrible things. Therefore,people concluded that God was horrible, and one had best do things one was toldbecause, if not, “God” might be more horrible still! Writing of his youthfulattitudes, Crowley wrote in Confessions:I was trying to take the view that the Christianity of hypocrisy and cruelty wasnot true Christianity. I did not hate God or Christ, but merely the God andChrist of the people whom I hated. It was only when the development of mylogical faculties supplied the demonstration that I was compelled to set myselfin opposition to the Bible itself. It does not matter that the literature issometimes magnificent and that in isolated passages the philosophy and ethicsare admirable. The sum of the matter is that Judaism is a savage, andChristianity a fiendish, superstition.5 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt405]Every sect used the “sacred scripture” to justify its position like opponents insport consulting the rulebook. And that is exactly what Crowley perceived inGeorge Bernard Shaw’s attempt to distill from the Gospels a message of socialistbrotherhood and sharing out of “common wealth.” That is why his book’s originaltitle was “The Gospel according to St. Bernard Shaw.” Shaw used the texts toserve his own purpose, like everyone else, and Crowley made it his task to showthat by that token he could not only demonstrate that Shaw was hopelessly wrongabout Jesus, but that everything liberal interpreters felt unpleasant about themore puritanical or fear-inducing forms of “hellfire Christianity” could bejustified in the Bible and had no business being diluted to suit taste. Hence,Crowley insisted that the Bible, like all scriptures, should be regarded as aproduct of its time in the light of scientific, objective historical scholarshipand variant interpretations presented in as balanced and unemotional a way aspossible. He expected the time would soon come when scriptures were studied asone might other historically inherited literature, inspiring in parts for some,no doubt, but without the heavy hand of unimpeachable (that is, unimpeached)authority.As for himself, he took from scripture what made sense to him or accorded with,or illuminated, his spiritual experience and gave the “other fella” the libertyto do the same. However, on one thing he was personally sure: the fundamentalformula of Christianity as practiced for the past two thousand years was ripefor evolutionary transformation in a new landscape, and he believed he had thekey, take it or not.Perhaps Crowley’s basic problem in America, especially after his attainment ofthe grade of Magus made of him a kind of occasional preacher of Thelema, wasthat he probably underestimated the depth of America’s fundamental conservatism.The place might appear to change with bewildering rapidity, fads and fancies,political, architectural, and economic, even philosophical and artisticenthusiasms might rise, shine, and sink again, but underneath it all has pulsedthe historic faith that carried many of the earliest migrants to the continentin the first place: the “rock of ages.” The “pilgrims” wished to worship freelyin the way they wanted, and in peace, if possible. The country might have becomea welter of different, sometimes competing sects; there might be the oddcharismatic prophet, pied piper, nutcase, or an inexplicable event suggestingmagic or miracle or spirits or ghosts, but underneath was always a bedrock ofChristianity and the God of Jewish faith in some form or other. Hypocrisy, lipservice, face saving was as endemic to the social polity in America as mostother places. Conformity to the norm was the norm. One nation under God, and formost—even most Freemasons—that meant the God of the Bible, old and/or newtestaments. Without the “one God” there was unlikely to be—so ran, and runs, thepatrician fear—the “one people.” Note, for example, how practically every timean element of the historical republican mythos appears in an American movie,such as the figure of Theodore Roosevelt, or the White House, Abraham Lincoln,or the stars and stripes, and so on, the music always sounds religious, withdeep cadences, codas, and harmonic tones redolent of biblical patriarchs. The“city on a hill” is Zion, and Arizona doubles as the Holy Land.If Thelema was ever going to make any serious headway in America, beyond theinterest or devotion of a relatively small minority of born esotericists orbohemian artists, it would have to make some kind of positive gesture to thehistoric faith of the vast majority of the shifting population. Crowley,however, utterly tolerant of other people’s beliefs as he was, could neverpresent his synthetic cultus as a variant on Christianity, or even himself as areformer or evolver of the faith. He had a personal antipathy to the wordChristianity, derived from youthful mistreatments, while historically andphilosophically he had decided, like many academics, that Christianity wasanyway heading for the cataract as an ethical and ecclesiastical system, and inthis conviction, he was, to say the least, premature or arguably wrong. Havingalways the uncompromising mentality of the committed artist (and prophet!),there was simply too much esoteric and intellectual challenge in his system,besides which, Crowley’s personal enthusiasm for the enlightened, mysticalpaganism of late antiquity with its easiness with sexuality in religiouscontexts was simply too scary in appearance to secure respect in people whowanted to be good, comfortable, and saved. Crowley imagined people wanted publicrites of corn and wine and a celebration of seasons, fertility, and thingsnatural in a religious context; he might better have addressed the NativeAmericans, who at least would have grasped the pantheism, if not the Latin.America was heading toward Prohibition, not “Do what thou wilt,” and of courseit goes without saying that had Crowley’s dynamic bisexuality become commonknowledge, his cause would have been finished by force of prejudice regardlessof anything else.None of this means, of course, that Crowley was misguided as to issues of truthin his case, but he was spitting in the wind if he thought his reception inAmerica might be an improvement over that in England where religious convictionswere concerned.In the light of all this it is important, as well as very interesting, to get aglimpse into his mind on the subject of the Christian faith and tradition, andhis hothouse effort to respond to G. B. Shaw in the summer of 1916 near Bristol,New Hampshire, allows us to do precisely that.SHAW TAKES A PASTINGWhatever problems Crowley might have been undergoing where neschamah (thespiritual mind) was concerned, his ruach, or rational mind, was ticking overwith the calm precision of a Swiss timepiece balanced on the hood of a RollsRoyce. His arguments are crisp, clear, erudite, and thoroughly modern in thebest sense.It is extremely painful to find oneself obliged to begin by a direct attack uponMr. Shaw’s logic. “The record that Jesus said certain things is not invalidatedby a demonstration that Confucius said them before him.” This is perfectly true,but it is a valid reason for talking about Confucius rather than about Jesus.[Shaw:] “It is the doctrine and not the man that matters.” In this case thedoctrine should be argued on first principles. It is entirely beside thequestion as to whether Jesus ever existed, and it is therefore a rhetoricaltrick to associate the life of Christ with any such argument.”6[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt406]Crowley writes as the man who studied classics and philosophy at Cambridge. Thisoccasionally leads him astray. For example, with regard to the doctrine ofJesus’s divine parentage, Crowley makes the valid point about Hellenisticculture in the Roman Empire: “We are face to face with the fact that it was aninvariable custom to honour any distinguished man by attributing divineparentage to him.”7 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt407] True, outside of Jewishculture, but plain blasphemous in an authentic Jewish context, unless Crowleywas taking the view that Jesus’s being literal “son of God” was a belief foistedon legend by Gentiles. Crowley did not have the advantage of seeing the Dead SeaScrolls from which he could have discerned that the messiah’s “sonship” of Godwas symbolic of the chosen king anointed, in analogous sense to the Christianbelief that God is “Father” of all mankind. When Jews heard Isaiah’s messianicprophecy that a virgin would conceive and bear a son, they did not hear it—as domost Christians at Christmas—that “a virgin will conceive and bear God’s son.”Crowley is of course sound in stressing the cultural norms operating at the timeof the Gospels’ composition. This he correctly brings to bear on the question ofthe “miracles” of Jesus: “The whole question of miracles depends, as will belater demonstrated, upon the psychology of the people among whom they areperformed.”8 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt408]Space obviously does not permit a full rehearsal of the enlightening discussionbetween the minds of Shaw and Crowley, so I shall list Crowley’s dominantpoints. 1. Crowley shares a contemporary scholarly opinion that “Jesus Christ” is a “convenient title” on which has been hung the sayings and doings of a number of people, as David is credited with the collection of Hebrew songs we call the Psalms.9 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt409] 2. Shaw says, “Gentle Jesus, meek and mild, is a sniveling invention, with no warrant in the Gospels.” On the contrary, says Crowley, read Matthew 11:29, or Matthew 21:5. The King “cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting on an ass”; “Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.” (Matthew 5:5)10 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt410] This method Crowley uses again and again, persistently knocking Shaw down with eloquent, superior knowledge of precise Bible texts. 3. Crowley accepts the figure “Jesus” as an avatar. “He was playing a part, and he naturally accepted its limitiations.”11 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt411] “Jesus” makes perfect sense to students of Hindu religious philosophy and practice. “I and my Father are one,” for example, is a straightforward description of samadhi. 4. Most people do not have a developed critical faculty and therefore fail to see contradictions in the texts. 5. Crowley sees the arrest, trial, and passion of Jesus as plainly a magical ritual to give effectiveness to “god eating,” the partaking in the powers of a god, or God. People have always preferred to let the god, or a substitute, do the suffering for them. Being saved “by the blood” is a plain example of god eating, a magical sacrament to imbibe the virtue of divine power. The story of Jesus has been constructed consciously or otherwise around the lineaments of ancient magical ritual, with appropriate prophecies attached. This is how working cults operate. 6. The “sin complex” is appropriate to a slave cult, or to people who have been enslaved mentally, physically, or both. “In the dark ages, every calamity was attributed by the priests to sin; and as such calamities were frequent, the spirit of the people was broken.” “The whole idea of sin and redemption is a direct metaphysical creation of the slave spirit.”12 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt412] 7. “When people are prosperous they do not want a Redeemer.”13 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt413] To “prosperous” Crowley should have added “youthful and healthy.” The old rich person may be most concerned about the hereafter as well as what is left behind. Besides, the canonical Gospels’ Jesus makes the very point that to ignore salvation for the sake of the world of time and space, and for the riches of the world etc., is to cling to sand, rather than spiritual rock. Crowley understood this (he held to spiritual values), but his Nietzschean “slave spirit” argument and realism ran away with him. Furthermore, prosperity can bring with it an unaccountable, perhaps atavistic realization that it “may not last,” inviting guilt (Crowley’s “sin complex”) and a desire to avert disaster by making “offerings” (such as passing a law to help homeless or unemployed folk). Crowley tends to lump all guilt into his sin complex. Is guilt always unjustified? Yes, if you’re doing your True Will, says Crowley! But there’s the rub. We are today more generally aware than many in 1916 of the irrational and debilitating nature of much guilt. Crowley’s position should be seen in this context, where the churches reiterated the biblical view that “none is righteous; no not one,” with its corollary: eternal damnation for sinners. He was operating in a world where many people were ashamed of their own genitalia and fearful of their own “sinful desires.” A lot of what Crowley has to say is simply modern psychology, somewhat ahead of its time. 8. Crowley regards sacramentalism and the theory of transubstantiation as rational and effective. “It is also impossible to doubt that Catholics obtain real spiritual sustenance from the Host.”14 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt414] 9. The “end of the world” provides gratification for the revenge of the slaves; for the masters a cost-free way of suppressing efforts to “change the world.” Crowley reckons that it’s healthier, and more manly, to fight for your right! 10. Crowley maintains that Shaw’s ignorance of the East makes him think, for example, that the visit of the “kings” (actually Magi) to Jesus’s cradle was obviously legendary, whereas Crowley says he has experienced similar things himself in the East and that the word king may there simply mean a local tribal leader or sheikh. Such men brought him gifts as he appeared to be a representative of the British government “in his own humble person.” Knowledge of the East is vital to understanding the stories in the Gospels. Much in the Bible is commonplace if you know where to go. Most importantly, Crowley maintains that every respectable yogi has his special rules of denial for followers, usually involving having no property, or giving up their coat, family, or whatnot, and loving one another as ministers of knowledge of God. Such rules are not intended as universal ethics but, for a specialist few, to concentrate the mind on the “kingdom of heaven,” the inner planes, or microcosm. Jesus conformed to this principle, knowing perfectly well that if everyone in the world abandoned nets, trade, finances, or families and homes, the world would dissolve into chaos. According to Luke, Jesus himself was funded by Joanna, the wife of Chuza, King Herod Antipas’s government minister. If Chuza had done what Jesus’s disciples were enjoined to do, there would have been nothing with which to buy the ass on which Jesus sat or pay for the room and victuals of the “last supper.” Judas was treasurer, concerned with how cash was spent. This evocation of Eastern customs, born of direct experience and understanding, constitutes one of Crowley’s most impressive arguments, as the world still grapples with the curious idea that socialism as a political creed has divine authority behind it. Crowley writes, “There are plenty of John the Baptists today in India. Take a dirty piece of cloth, a little turmeric, a lot of cowdung, and a pair of tongs; and you have him. He is a half crazy, half savage individual, brusque and violent in speech, impossible in manner, who practices all kinds of austerity, feeds on refuse, and is usually in a condition of more or less maniacal excitement produced by fasting, or the use of such drugs as opium or hashish, or both.”15 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt415] Every teacher has his particular secrets, usually received from a line of venerables before him. They are jealously guarded from those outside the band and communicated only to carefully chosen disciples. Crowley sees the activity of the Magus thus: “We now see Jesus in a totally different light. He is not only an orthodox revivalist, but a leader of what we should call nowadays a secret society.”16 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt416] Jesus was not a communist, and his injunctions were proper to one establishing a religious brotherhood. The empire’s need for a syncretic religion to unite disparate territories turned an esoteric narrative into a “religion for everyone,” whose very universality meant that most members would be judged to have failed from meeting the specialist standards embedded in the tradition but thrown wide open willy-nilly, without the original teacher’s guidance and discernment. “Jesus” would not have recognized himself in a modern, or indeed medieval, church. 11. And what of “love your enemies”? “This is a fair statement of the ordinary rules for Hindu ascetics. The idea is that by becoming ahimsa, or ‘harmless’ . . . they will acquire immunity from the savagery of others. . . . The doctrine is not to be taken any further than this.”17 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt417] 12. Hellfire and damnation is intrinsic to the Gospels; there’s no getting around it, and the Billy Sundays of this world have abundant and unequivocal scriptural warrant for their most brimstone-ish threats. Except, have these passages of unforgiving punishment and annihilation not been removed from their original context, whatever that may once have been? Crowley offers biblical reference after biblical reference with a directness a Jehovah’s Witness would be proud of to make it clear that the modern preacher is quite right by his or her understanding to insist that “Jesus” was adamant that he was the sole and only route to salvation from coming catastrophe. There is no relativism in the apocalyptic narratives. It’s Jesus, or death. Take your pick. Crowley notes that uncompromising, insensitive extremism is frequently characteristic of small groups of religious enthusiasts in the East. A fearful people are easily enflamed. Many a guru has little care for the world; he’s given it up and he considers it as dust already. The “best of both worlds” is not his game. 13. Crowley goes through most of the parables, deciding which have value and which are just referential to accepting Jesus as sole leader. Some of his summaries are deadpan amusing, such as Luke 12:16–21: “Do not accumulate wealth, but live like ravens or lilies”; or Luke 16:1–12: The Unjust Steward. Moral: Sauve qui peut.*122 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft122] 14. “You cannot convince any Eastern by reason. The Eastern bows to authority. Proving anything to him is a waste of time. . . . Take the well-known case of John Nicholson, who so impressed the natives of the Punjab by his executive power that some of them turned him into a god, and worshipped him. He, being a particularly pious Christian, tried to beat it out of them; but the more he beat them, the more godlike he appeared.”18 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt418] 15. Shaw says it’s a waste of time to suggest that Christianity stands or falls by whether the miracles were true. On the contrary, asserts Crowley, Christianity is at stake. “Remove the miracles, remove the prophecies, and nothing is left but a little doctrine, much of it contradictory, as has already been shown, and in any case explicable in a dozen ways besides that which appeals to Mr. Shaw.”19 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt419] 16. Crowley found the idea of a “gentle” Jesus, a forgiving kind of person, a wish fantasm, unjustified by many texts, such as “I come not to bring peace but a sword” (Matthew 10:34–5) among others. Hellfire evangelists know their Bible better than many scholarly critics. Crowley had been raised to take the Bible text at face value. There’s nothing wrong with divine love, Crowley is saying, so long as you don’t confuse that elevated idea with Christianity as revealed in the Bible. Most aren’t worthy of it, and besides, should not the Father have loved his “only begotten Son” enough not to allow his enemies to string him up and nail him down? That is, if you take the accounts literally. The point is that you can construct the religion you prefer from the same texts, which only suggests the disparate origin of the material. Christianity is no less a composite creation than a scarecrow. 17. Crowley observes that certain texts have very definite signs of being written for “an extremely specialized class of persons.”20 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt420] John contains definite signs of kabbalistic knowledge, as does Genesis. He sees it as the speculation of a Gnostic or an Essene. Many today would agree with him. 18. Crowley sees no basis for respecting common beliefs or the beliefs of common minds. “The common incredulity or credulity of the ignorant and prejudiced classes is simply not worth discussion.” Shaw says, “Belief is literally a matter of taste; but only among people who are so intellectually inferior that they have never taught themselves to think. Credible is a silly word. It only means ‘consonant with the main content of our knowledge of the Universe.’ Hence any fact which when established requires an extension of that knowledge is antecedently incredible.”21 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt421] 19. A Crowleyan prophecy: “Mr. Shaw imagines the Bible to be out of date, as he imagines himself to be superseding Shakespeare. How the twenty-first century will laugh! No; The Bible is great literature—in parts; and will stand as such while Shakespeare stands.”22 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt422] 20. Another, and for us, last prophecy. Crowley demolishes socialism (“Equal Distribution”) in three paragraphs. “Happiness comes with pride in what you are, unhappiness with wanting to be something that you are not. The discontent in England is principally the result of the intense social snobbery which prevails in every circle.” Crowley predicts the failure of communism (a year before the Russian revolution even began!). Inventions require risk-taking capitalists out for profit after a sacrificial investment of money; “This is another reason why humanity would stagnate under communism.”23 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt423] 21. Paul, Crowley surmises, was obsessed with sex, so much as to make a sin of it, instead of seeing it as a perfectly natural human appetite like eating and drinking. “Where there is congenital incapacity we almost always find fanaticism. . . . We do not find the average man of the world is in any way obsessed by sex. It is the abnormal people who talk, and talk, and talk about it in a way which is nauseating even though it be so pitiful!”24 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt424] 22. Crowley has no problem with the idea that “Jesus” was an adept in the skills of the thaumaturge. He refers to his correspondence with Professor Elihu Thomson, who had made him aware that all phenomena are ultimately to be subject to electrical laws. Therefore, the yogi was someone with understanding of the conditions by which one state may be combined with, or supersede, another. 23. Crowley sees how the existence of empires encourages universalist faiths based on syncretism. It happened in the Roman period with the emergence of Christianity and he sees Britain’s presence in India has brought about a universalist syncretic religious awareness, known as Theosophy, transplanted to Europe and America. Crowley himself was trying to distill the best quintessence of the Theosophical achievement and subject it to experiment on scientific lines, allowing for discoveries of new knowledge, bound to appear incredible until established.And this is the fundamental position of Crowley on Christ; that is, that theknowledge that became available to the Roman Empire, derived from Easternsources, was consistent with its time sufficiently to be taken for adaption butin the process was itself adapted by the ignorance of the time. So long as thecosmography of the ancient world persisted, Christianity could travel on thesame knowledge train as natural philosophy. Crowley’s point is that the trainhas now exceeded its travel companion, leading to a religious deficit. That newreligious perspective will necessarily take in the timeless elements of ancientspirituality but will incorporate the pristine of the past into the vision ofthe future. What “Jesus” is thought to have accomplished may be achieved inprinciple today. The time has come, he declares, for a fresh religious vision intune with science on all planes.Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I doshall he do also; and greater than these shall he do; because I go unto myFather. (John 14:12)And, it should be noted, in terms of comparative religious symbolism in itshistorical context, “Jesus” was understood in late ancient Egypt as “Horus,”anyway, the rising god of the sun; as Isis, like Mary, was the Mother of thegod. “Hail the sun of righteousness!” And does not Christmas celebrate the“crowned and conquering Child,” reborn annually in the stable of the world?“Love, and do what you will.”"},{"pageContent":"TWENTY-FOURimage [images/9781620556313_099.jpg]Nothingnesswith TwinklesFor some reason Crowley took a train from Bristol some 93 miles south to thestately city of Boston, Massachusetts, for the long weekend of July 22 to 23.There he found “Mercury on the spot,”1 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt425] which isto say he had thirty dollars stolen. Perhaps in ironic tribute to thekleptomanic god, the victim from outta town performed the IX° to the “Glory ofHermes” on the Sunday night with French-Canadian prostitute Marie Roussel.Marie, he noted, bore striking resemblance in face, form, and manner to risquépianist, actor, dancer, and choreographer Maud Allan (1873–1956), whom he hadmet in late 1914.You have doubtless seen Maud’s exotic, sexy image on the psychedelic posters andalbums dedicated to the first great American music festival, which is to sayInternational Pop Festival held at Monterey in the Summer of Love (1967). She isthe monochrome beauty whose near nudity is draped in pearls and silks, with hairlike Louise Brooks’s, hips like Isis’s, and a come-on like Mata Hari’s. Everfascinated by Oscar Wilde, Crowley, like most of the Western world who couldafford it, had seen a great deal of Maud Allan in Wilde’s hit play Salome, witha shocking dance of the seven veils, which went truly beyond the veil, unveilingin the process the erotic fantasies of men and women of the age, Crowley beingone of them. The English Lord Chamberlain had banned Wilde’s play in 1892, butthe 1908 London production ran for two years, breaking box-office records. Atone performance women constituted 90 percent of the audience. Word must havegotten out that Maud was bisexual, another fascination for Crowley, who had anaffair with Maud, spoiled only, according to his diary,*123[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft123] by her “self-worship.” He dedicated a poem toher, praising “the zephyrs of her feet”; “For all her body is the Soul ofSpring.”image [images/9781620556313_059.jpg]Fig. 24.1. Maud Allan (1873–1956)Unfortunately, in 1916, a rumored affair between Maud and Prime Minister HerbertHenry Asquith’s wife, Margot, got Tory MP and obsessive moral watchdog NoelPemberton Billing sniffing into upper-class artistic goings-on that resulted ina prurient article published in 1918 in American-born antihomosexualitycampaigner Harold Spencer’s paper Imperialist. It alleged that a Berlin-backedsecret society had infiltrated Britain using homosexual debauchery to destroythe war effort. Hearing of a private performance of Salome, Billing targetedMaud Allan directly, accusing her and many others of membership in the “Cult ofthe Clitoris.” Billing’s outrageous, trumped-up perjuries and libelsnevertheless convinced a prejudiced jury that Maud had no grounds for a libelcase, and, in June 1918, Billing was acquitted amid triumphant applause. Maudnever danced publicly again; she died in a Los Angeles nursing home onOctober 7, 1956. This was the kind of thing that Crowley was up against, andstill is.Returning to the Adams Cottage on July 24, he spent the next day swimming beforeindulging, though very tired, in four “Myriam Deroxe pills.” You may recallbeautiful actress Myriam from San Francisco. She devised a drug recipe: onecentigram (cg) morphia, one cg opium, one cg Sparteine. Result: “Nothing!”2[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt426] But at least he had Myriam on his mind. Thinkingof her on August 3, he performed an “orgiastic” autoerotic sex-magick actdedicated to “yoni,”3 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt427] regarding its successfulfulfillment in a IX° with Marie Roussel, performed when back in Boston for theweekend of Saturday, August 12, whose own “object” was success with the Shawarticle. Crowley then had magical sex with a man on the Sunday and Mondaydescribed in Rex as “sheer joy.”4 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt428] “Never dullwhere Crowley is,” friends used to say in London.Before returning to Boston, Crowley showed that he hadn’t entirely given up workfor Miss Adams, for he spent all day of July 26 working on what he called the“Adams Cryptogram,” meaning, I think, that he was hidden in a writing she wouldpublish as her own. He then went on to carve a phallic fetish that could serveas a dildo, single or double; Crowley’s sex aid would be worth quite a bit tosomeone today.On July 28, he took another peyote trip (400 chocolate-based drops of Anhaloniumlewinii) at 5:50 p.m. The effects seemed to wear off by 7:35, but he noticedsome unusual mental effects later on, such as analyzing trivial matters, orfinding simple acts pleasurable, or when thinking of things that normally causeddistress, dismissing them “like Jesus, with a jest.”5[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt429] He wrote letters easily enough though took“silly personal pride” in, say, his Greek knowledge, or his height, seeinghimself as regards the Shaw work as “the ripe scholar and theologian, halfpatriarch and half don!!!” He didn’t realize it, but that’s what he might havebeen, had it not been for his coming into a fortune at twenty-one and, ofcourse, being chosen by the gods to herald the Aeon and be its Word.On July 29, his worst fears about Ananda Coomaraswamy’s “care” for Alice Ethelcame to fruition when he heard she had miscarried their child on July 12 whilecrossing to England. This, incidentally perhaps, was the very day the globe offire had appeared in his room and touched his hand. Crowley calmed himself bycarving and painting fetishes, gazing occasionally into the fire on which hecooked his meals in the open, coming to see the knife not as an instrument forharming but rather for creating. This was not as platitudinous as one mightthink, for he had in mind the vision of the Magus of the Tarot in the thirdAethyr: “On his feet hath he the scythes and swords and sickles; daggers;knives; every sharp thing—a millionfold, and all in one.” He noted, “I have justrealized (after some days woodcarving) that the use of a knife is to fashionshapeless things into beauty. This then is the task of a Magus.”6[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt430] Not being of the grade when he had the originalvision, he could not see it.And so he passed the first weeks of August: canoeing and swimming, tryingunsuccessfully to tame a thrush that entered the cottage, failing to kill asnake, and writing instructions on sexual doctrines and promoting Thelema fornew Master of the Temple Jones (“Parzifal”). Amid lightning and booming thunder,and a close, horrible atmosphere, he became morose on the night of August 6,thinking of Leila Waddell, the “Mother of Heaven” as “the only thing I have ofvalue.” In something like denial over Jeanne, he decided that he “idealized andloved Leila and Rose [first wife] for themselves.” It was “romantic” love thatmade him sing.7 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt431] Ironically, he had spent thewhole day editing The Golden Rose, the still unpublished anthology of poetrydedicated solely to the love of himself and Jeanne Robert Foster. Taking wine tohelp things along, he took 400 drops of a new mescaline preparation, but nothingcame of it but a sense of “well-being.”Two days later he wrote the letter to Professor Bigelow about the ball lightningand his own “super-Masonic” order, sending Bigelow a pamphlet about it,presumably the one he’d been writing for Jones, then spent the next three dayson the Shaw “article” with his frog-stenographer before heading again forBoston. Returning, he found the whole atmosphere at the cottage had changed, asif a banishing ritual had been performed there. Was it the beginning of a “NewCurrent”? Would “The Girl” arrive?Someone fateful would arrive, but it would not be The Girl. In the meantime,Crowley wrote another tract for the O.T.O., inspired in some way by the Qur’an’sthirty-sixth sura, “Ya-Sin,” which begins, “By the Qur’an, full of Wisdom, /Thou art one of the Apostles, / On the Straight Way . . .” before writing to“Anna Wright and her Companions,” which is to say, the South African branch ofthe O.T.O, of which Anna and her husband were members.*124[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft124] He then devoted a four-day stint to the Shawarticle, considering it “well started” on August 19 when he wrote to ProfessorLindley Miller Keasbey (1867–1946), professor of institutional history at theUniversity of Austin, Texas, described in the Confessions as “a charming andcultured man, but full of cranky notions about socialism, which he held witharrogant obstinacy.”8 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt432] Keasbey’s views onsocialism would cost him his chair at Austin, while his treachery would cost himCrowley’s respect, but that was all to come. In the meantime, Keasbey tried toget a half-page, subversive article into Pearson’s Magazine, under FrankHarris’s socialist editorship. Harris’s colleagues did not understand it; theWashington censor did not understand it; he did not understand it: nobodyunderstood it. So Harris took it. “What harm can it do?”August 21 marked the beginning of the tenth Chockmah day. On this day Crowleyrecorded “an amazing discovery,”9 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt433] which nobodycan deny. Perhaps it resulted from a “wonderful” ether-flavored solo sex-magickact dedicated to promulgating Thelema while thinking of Doris Gomez and MyriamDeroxe on August 19.Around 3:40 a.m. on the 21st, Crowley saw the light. As we saw earlier, The Bookof the Law had spoken of “one” that “cometh after” (AL III:47), referringpossibly to Jones. Crowley now followed a series of cross-symbolic coincidencesthat by incremental force convinced him that Jones was the “child” predicted byThe Book of the Law. The child of Crowley’s (symbolic) “bowels” (AL I:55–56)would appear “strangely,” and you can’t get stranger than his new magical sonborn from the Abyss as Master of the Temple as direct result of Therion’smagical sex with Jeanne Foster precisely nine months earlier! All that magicaleffort just had to have had an effect on the spiritual plane; the gods doubtlessknew Hilarion was barren, even if Crowley had not. Crowley had expected anatural child, but a spiritual child was what the gods intended, or so it dawnedon the Beast. “Expect him not from the East, nor from the West; for from noexpected house cometh that child” (AL I:56). Indeed. No one would have expectedthis: a revelation that at last made triumphant sense of the relationship withJeanne. The gods had made his conscious mind idealize her, even though she wasnot the ideal, so he might work holy magick upon her and establish conditionsfor the birth of a new Master of the Temple. What would a father not do for hisson? Crowley wrote to Jones in August that, as the Beast succinctly put it, hehad fucked Hilarion for him. Thus, Crowley’s relationship with Jeanne was notthe emotional disaster it felt like, but a meaningful, even preternatural, actof the gods to further the Beast’s initiation. Did not Hilarion conform to thedescription of the Scarlet Woman in AL III:44? “But let her raise herself inpride! Let her follow me in my way! Let her work the work of wickedness! Let herkill her heart! Let her be loud and adulterous! Let her be covered with jewels,and rich garments, and let her be shameless before all men!” Yep, that’s howit’d felt.There doubtless exists psychoanalytic jargon for a leap of faith of thisextremity, but adding more correspondents to the mystery, or lack of it, best beavoided, lest one perish “with the dogs of reason” (AL II:27). Crowley’s godsmoved him in mysterious ways. If a virgin can conceive and bring forth a son,anything is possible, belief being dependent on predisposition. To give an ideaof just one of the “proofs” that to Crowley’s mind supported his conclusion, henoted that the word divined for the equinox was Solomon.*125[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft125] Was not Solomon the child of David’s adultery?10[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt434] Thinking contrary to Nature as a Magus mightwell lead to conclusions as apparently outlandish as this. Crowley spent therest of the day writing and thinking out the chronology of the Initiation toMagus, concluding, “The crises at the dawn of a Chokmah-day are amazing.”11[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt435] How true.On August 23 he wrote the letter to Elihu Thomson (see here[9781620556313_c22.xhtml#p411]) asking if Crowley’s own electrical theory aboutthe ball lightning was “quite mad.” At 7:35 p.m. he undertook an extensiveexperiment with ethanol, mescaline, diethyl ether, hashish, and cocaine, whichis a lot of eggs to put in one basket. His ensuing state of mind convinced himof the relativity of consciousness; everything was dependent on state of mind.I have been sucking up to the vapour of Ether for a few moments, and all commonthings are touched with beauty. So, too, with opium and cocaine, calm, peace,happiness, without special object, result from a few minutes of those drugs.What clearer proof that all depends on state of mind, that it is foolish toalter externals. A million spent on objets d’art would not have made this roomas beautiful as it is just now—and there is not one beautiful thing in it,except myself. Man is only a little lower than the angels; one step, and allglory is ours!12 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt436]After taking more ether around 8:00 p.m. he became particularly active andfidgety, deciding after observing a train of logic that led him to write notesfor an article on yoga, it would be a beautiful article. Oh God! he cried,another beautiful thing! He was at it on September 13, writing about pratyahara(the fifth of Pantajali’s eight stages of ashtanga yoga, denoting withdrawal ofthe senses) when he realized succinctly, “What people miss is that a yogin canget as much fun out of swinging his leg as a Western millionaire out of hisfirst season in New York. This ought to be worked up for propaganda purposes.”13[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt437] He meant O.T.O., not German propaganda!He analyzed his own state of mind, noting that ether states, like alldrug-induced states, are ephemeral. They represent an instability, with timeflying fast in the case of ether. He came that August night, however, to avision that remained with him all his life and that he would call the “StarSponge Vision.” Perhaps it was the kind of thing that inspired Beethoven towrite his 9th Symphony. It helped Crowley write everything he would ever write.THE STAR SPONGE VISIONIt came in stages, like Christmas to Iowa by Wells Fargo. He lost consciousnessof everything but a universal space with occasional bright points. “Nothingnesswith twinkles,” he said. Concentrating, the void diminished in significance andthe space appeared ablaze, the radiating points neither confused nor obscured.It was the essential structure of the universe. “But what twinkles!” he added,as might have occurred to the speechless “Bowman” in the penultimate sequence ofKubrick’s 2001.The next stage led Crowley to envision the blazing points as the stars of theheavens, identified as ideas, and souls, among other things. Each star waslinked to every other star by a ray of light. That is, in the realm of thought,every thought carried a special relation with every other thought, and eachrelation a thought in itself, as each ray from star to star was itself a star.Because he could see clearly an infinite series, then the vision should havebeen experienced as one homogeneous blaze of light, but it was not so.Distinctions were in no way obscure. The points were clear.The next stage brought him to see that the whole was perfectly organized, withsome stars more brilliant than others but no less in relation to the whole. Thevision offered psychological insights, such as how a person might confusehimself with a teapot (an object close to an idea of himself), or why it wasthat platitudes seemed dull, even though they contained the whole history oflogical thought on a subject extended through series. One recalls PaulMcCartney’s anecdote of smoking marijuana in a Manhattan hotel room in 1964 andbeing brought via remarkable leaps to what seemed a profound revelation oftruth, which was eagerly written down for its import, only to be disappointed on“returning to earth” to find the phrase “There are seven steps.” Of course, toan alchemist, that would mean a great deal.At the time, Crowley considered his vision the samadhi of the ether state,perhaps the ultimate samadhi, union with essence or being of the cosmos. He alsothought the images too physical, it was “the old resolution of Splendour intoBliss.”14 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt438] In a fragment held among Crowley’spapers at the Warburg Institute titled “Platitudes,” Crowley recognized the“Star-Sponge vision” as being the nervous system, considered as a microcosm.This insight might inspire the neurologist. For the mystic, the vision bears thecharacter of Hermetic prophet Giordano Bruno’s sixteenth-century vision of the“infinite Universe.” Bruno (1548–1600) understood the universe as a synthesis ofinfinite relativity, and that seems a reasonable account of what Crowley becameaware of under considerable chemical stimulus, while more soldiers were led upto the front lines on the Western Front to substitute the ones no longervisible.Hard work continued. On August 27, Crowley felt “fagged out.” After more work onShaw, and “reading Frazer’s Dying God,”15 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt439] hetook four “Myriam Deroxe pills” but got very little but some “considerations” asto what his “Cross of the Frog” might have been all about. It is even possible,given the vagueness of the diary entry, that he was considering either composingit, rewriting it, or perhaps putting it into action. It should not be presumedthat Crowley ever crucified a frog in literal terms. One rather suspects thecomposition of Liber LXX was a psychological exercise, but you never know.For the next fortnight, Crowley moved on to writing the individual stories thatmake up the collection Golden Twigs, obviously inspired by Frazer’s GoldenBough, and based on mythology and folklore. In 1930 he would dedicate the worksto “Dr. Sir J.G. Frazer Master of the Gods,” and to the memories of “Merlin”(Theodor Reuss, O.T.O. Frater Superior) and, surprisingly, to D. H. Lawrence,who died in March of that year.16 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt440]On August 30, 1916, he wrote “The Priest of Nemi” (published in theInternational in April 1918 and later retitled “The King of the Wood”). The nextday he worked on Shaw and most of The Mass of St Sécaire, whose fourth chapterhas an atmospheric scene set in a ruined church, somewhat inspired by recentimaginings, or perhaps, acts. Obviously suggested by accounts of Black Massesand with more than a whiff of the curious services of the infamous Abbé Boullan(1824–1893) and his female assistant, Crowley calls it a “hideous rite.”There were two lights upon the altar, candles of black wax, both on the northside of what served for crucifix.This was a live toad nailed to a scarlet cross. Around it was wrapped a strip oflinen, torn from one of Captain Larue’s shirts by a bribed laundress. Forincense a stick of yellow sulphur smouldered on charcoal.17[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt441]The priest baptizes the frog in the name of Larue; as the frog dies, so mightLarue. The author is clearly describing bad goings-on, it should be noted, andthe wicked rite literally “brings the house down” on “the abominable celebrants”when at the stroke of midnightthe whole chapel was ablaze with globes of fire, and the storm shook the wallsof the chapel with whirling rage. A rotten beam came crashing from the roof.“Come away!” said the priest, unshaken, “there is danger here.” But at thatinstant the storm died down; the electricity of the air discharged itselffinally to earth; the stars shone out again.18 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt442]Crowley managed to get Liber LXX, the ball lightning, and even a hint of thestar-sponge vision into one scene of fictional perversity. He used what came tohand, the sign of a good artist and a constrained being. His pen had become aknife shaping works of beauty.On September 1 he finished the story above and also the Shaw “article,” now ofbook length, before penning “The Burning of Melcarth,” “The Oracle of theCorycian Cave,” “The Stone of Cybele,” “The God of Ibreez,” “The Old Man of thePeepul-tree,” and “The Hearth”; all done by 9:30 p.m. the night of September 14.And that was Golden Twigs. Not bad for a summer “retirement.”To add to the literary halo around Crowley’s phallic forelock, thenow-controversial German American journalist, satirist, scholar, and literarycritic of the Smart Set, H. L. Mencken (1880–1956) published Crowley’s shortstory “The Stratagem.”19 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt443] First published in theEnglish Review in June 1914, no less a genius than Joseph Conrad (1857–1924) hadpraised it as the best short story he had read, to Crowley’s proud delight.After starting what became “The Stone of Cybele” on September 6, Crowley madeanother experiment with ether. It brought him insight into the differencebetween the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel and otherinterior illuminations. He literally “saw” the difference (with eightexclamation marks).The former gives proof to the man as man of a celestial hierarchy; it relieveshim of his main fear—materialism itself. Hence mysticism is no good to convincepeople—in comparison with magick. You must argue with the man you are arguingwith; mysticism is like making him drunk.11:50 [p.m.]. I now see why the Buddha said: “Don’t fight error; preach the GoodLaw!” Too much error to fight! Dissipating energies! Even Christianity is hardlyworth fighting; so many atheists are shocked if one does! Therefore: Do whatthou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. And nothing else.20[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt444]The next day he got a letter from Myriam, now in New York, about the “MyriamDeroxe” pills, presumably as to their ineffectiveness. Perhaps the drug fiendhad further advice, for in the evening, in thick, hot weather, Crowley triedsolo sex magick, thinking of Myriam, for the “promulgation of the Law,” usingheroin and ether. The next morning he suffered from diarrhea and headache,spending the day half asleep. One suspects Myriam was made of different stuffthan her country correspondent.Crowley finished his Golden Twigs just in time for the voluble Keasbey’s arrivalon September 15; he stayed for four days and talked practically nonstop. IfCrowley had a head of steam to let off, so did Keasbey. Crowley wrote for him atract, Liber 161, The Law of Thelema, and made tentative plans for going toTexas to establish an O.T.O. lodge at Austin. Keasbey was, however, inincreasingly poor odor with university colleagues. But Crowley was almost alwaysoptimistic. Having been a candidate for the presidency of the university in1915, Keasbey would soon be dismissed and a date for going to Austin set withCrowley for November 4 was junked after much prevarication on Keasbey’s side.Exhausted from six weeks’ writing, comfort came to Lake Pasquaney in the form ofGerda Maria von Kothek, whose ministrations helped him to relax a bit andconsider the status of semen in the formulation of the Word of the Magus and “inthe mouth of the victim.”21 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt445] On September 23 hegot into Jung’s Psychology of the Unconscious, soon concluding that he couldapply some of Jung’s theories to obtain samadhi. He performed a dozen sex-magickoperations with Gerda—mostly for wealth—before returning to New York on October17. His fascinating article “Mystics and Their Little Ways” could be read inVanity Fair that month, followed in November by “The Attainment of Happiness.”The former article is full of pithy wisdom. “Every mystic of any account isreally a solitary who, thinking to bring all men to his own perfection, merelysucceeds in founding a new cult, or religion.” For those who ask what mysticismis, the answer is “really quite simple. It is merely a State of Mind in whichall phenomena are regarded as pure illusion. The only reality is what is calledby one mystic the pleroma; by another Isvara, or Parabrahman, or perusa; by athird, God; by a fourth, the Pure Soul; by a fifth, Being, or the Absolute—andso on, more or less indefinitely.” So there you are.22[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt446] Crowley also suggests that those seeking furtherenlightenment consult his Book of Lies (1912), which is easy to read, but not tounderstand. “The Attainment of Happiness” is like the second part of the latterand is no less forthright. “The Saviour’s instructions to his disciples to ‘takeno thought for the morrow,’ to ‘abandon father and mother and all other things,’‘not to have two cloaks,’ ‘not to resist evil,’ are merely the ordinary rules ofevery eastern and western mystic. The disciple must have nothing whatever toturn his mind to duality, or to divert his mind from concentration.”23[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt447] Needless to say, unhappiness comes from duality;mysticism cures the problem. Result: happiness. So why don’t we?"},{"pageContent":"TWENTY-FIVEimage [images/9781620556313_099.jpg]New Orleans—and BustIn December 1916, with his “Improvement on Psychoanalysis” gracing the pages ofVanity Fair, Crowley was preoccupied with pecuniary matters, especially withwinter advancing, and as far as we can tell, the end of Evangeline Adams’sgenerosity with respect to her property in New Hampshire. None of this anxietyenters into his article, however, which is a brief but significant introductionto the public of the world of Carl Jung of Zurich.Crowley has read carefully and seen that where Freud derives will from sex, Jungderives sex from will, which is a bonus for the magical tradition. Nevertheless,Crowley is not uncritical of Jung and applies his razor carefully to Jung’stendency to see everything in terms of unconscious symbols to the exclusion ofother dimensions of experience and causation. One might say this is the potcalling the kettle black, but it is satisfying to read of Jung before he becamelauded as one of those intellectual heroes of the twentieth century who mustalways be right, even when wrong. Crowley addressed his critique gently, but onequal terms.Crowley took forty dollars south, thinking New Orleans closer to a hoped-foropportunity with Keasbey in Texas. It was an act of faith, of willfulness, andwas not rewarded with an O.T.O. lodge in Austin but rather with other goods thatwould have to wait many years to surrender any return. He was walking intoconsiderable hardship.Choosing his billet with customary wisdom, Crowley checked into a hotel onDauphine Street and began to explore New Orleans. Crowley found a cityreminiscent of Cairo, divided by a wide thoroughfare, scored by trolley-cartracks, with one side offering the delights. Unsurprisingly, Crowley adored theold French-Spanish quarter of the city, finding its redlight district on theoutskirts particularly delightful: its sultry streets had a civilization oftheir own. There he met “Irene Standfield,” an extremely voluptuous prostituteof the “greatest possible skill and goodwill,”1 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt448]and “Eleanore Jackson,” who “claimed to be ‘pure American’ (!) but is I think amixture of Negro and Japanese. Slim, normal, excessively active, andpassionate.” An “excellent” operation with Eleanore for “wealth” yielded only apleasant memory.2 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt449]It was said that along with San Antonio, New Orleans was the sole repository ofsoul left in an American city, though Crowley felt it already under shadow ofbanishment at the behest of moral hypocrites, prohibitionists, and dollar-mad,mindless development. In 1916 the city was still imbued with distinction oftime, with its fascinatingly ramshackle elements, its balconies, pillars, archedwindows, continental-style shutters, colors, charming manners, clothes, customs,and cookery. He said nothing of the music (he liked raucous tunes but had beenspoiled by Wagner for much else), but he very much appreciated the “Old AbsintheHouse,” reminiscent of better days he’d witnessed in Paris. There he wrote “TheGreen Goddess” about the addictive drink that had drowned many a poet, and ofits cradle.It lies in New Orleans, between Canal Street and Esplanade Avenue; theMississippi for its base. Thence it reaches northward to a most curious desertland, where is a cemetery lovely beyond dreams. Its walls low and whitewashed,within which straggles a wilderness of strange and fantastic tombs; and hard byis that great city of brothels which is so cynically mirthful a neighbor. AsFelicien Rops wrote,—or was it Edmond d’Haraucourt?—“la Prostitution et la Mortsont frère et soeur—les fils de Dieu!” At least the poet of Le Legende des Sexeswas right, and the psycho-analysts after him, in identifying the Mother with theTomb. This, then, is only the beginning and end of things, this “quartiermacabre” beyond the North Rampart with the Mississippi on the other side. It islike the space between, our life which flows, and fertilizes as it flows, muddyand malarious as it may be, to empty itself into the warm bosom of the GulfStream, which (in our allegory) we may call the Life of God.3[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt450]Reclining comfortably at 238 Bourbon Street, the Absinthe House’s two-storyexterior resembled an old Parisian café, while its interior possessed theprana-soaked character of a well-worn pub in London’s Soho. A cozy, pleasantsaloon opened within, bounded with pattern-tiled walls, mirrors, and, mostimportantly, a very solid wooden bar running its length, bounded by welcomingbottles. Slender pillars supported cross beams, and a marble floor led to archeddoorways onto the streets. Crowley spent as much time in the Old Absinthe Houseas possible, writing, writing, writing . . .He saw a great deal of life in New Orleans, too much really. He could seeclearly its life and soul were under threat from puritanical maniacs and otherforces of global standardization of product, atmosphere, architecture, evenclothing. Crowley had enjoyed the costumes of many races in distant places, allgradually being turned over in appearance by featureless, cheap, shoddy versionsof Western dress and drab cuts that rendered living beings into sad mannequinsin a reflective world of materialist vacuity. God! How he wanted to see a worldwhere men walked as kings and women like goddesses!It is necessary to live in the United States and know the people well to get areally clear view of hell with the lid off. I had already been some time in thecountry, but the truth about New York had been camouflaged. I, being who I was,had come into contact with the very cream of the city, and on my travels aboutthe Union, I had seen little more than the superficial life of the people as itappears to the wanderer whose tent is a pullman car, a swagger hotel, or theabode of some friend who by that very fact is not truly representative of hiscommunity.4 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt451]Stickups with revolvers were common, “frame-ups,” internecine murders ofhusbands and wives, arson, unemployment, suicides of the young, infantmortality: all regular occurrences. The churches were of course full. It ishardly surprising that brothels appeared a soft target for the politicallyambitious to demonstrate a social poultice to uphold Christian decency. Onelocal “noise” decided that he was called by civic duty to “clean up” the city,which meant leaning on the whorehouses.Emerging from the library in Lee Circle, Crowley was accosted by a woman,begging for cents. He recognized her from the red-light district, an environmentmore in tune with her skills. Morality had put her on the streets to beg. Hethought her surprisingly cheerful considering the circumstances. Oh, she said;she was all right. She was starting a job soon: looking after a comfortably offcouple’s children.What would they learn from her?In retrospect, Crowley believed the gods, as part of his initiation, were goingto give him a protracted taste of what ordinary people experienced and of whatpoverty drove the degraded to do. And he saw the spiritual wasteland up front,in full color, sufficient to invade the citadel of his soul and desecrate itwith the despair, depravity, and disease of individual human misery. He sawhumanity in the raw, and he had to take his medicine as his dollar accountdwindled to starvation level.That, of course, is not the way it appeared to people in New Orleans, whoaccepted their reality for what it was. Had Crowley consulted the papers, hewould have seen on the front page of the December 7, 1916, Herald a city gearingup for Christmas jollity.SANTA CLAUS IS IN TOYLANDCome on back to Toy Town—joy town! Come on back, you grownups, and bring thelittle folks, and feel again the thrill and wonder of it. The gates are openwide and it’s a sparkling, shining Fairyland for the kiddies—and for thegrown-ups too, who are able to “come back.”The toys are new, ingenious, clever, wonderful, and they are all ready andwaiting for your visit.You owe the children a visit to Toy Town at Maison Blanche. It’s one of thegreatest pleasures of the festive season. The whole town fairly beams with theholiday spirit, and if happiness is “catching,” you’ll certainly absorb it.Come on, everybody! Because Christmas is coming, and we ALL believe in SantaClaus.We Will Gladly Cash Your Xmas Savings ChecksNO CHARGE BRING THEM HEREMaison BlancheGREATEST STORE SOUTHCrowley had only been in New Orleans for a week when it all suddenly became toomuch for him. On December 15, he informed the masters that while he had recentlyreceived two subs of cash, both times he had been within a dollar of starvation,and after years of this kind of perpetual insecurity, he could bear it nolonger. He would go “on strike,” and if he starved, it was the gods’ ownresponsibility. He felt he’d come to the end of himself. He wanted a guaranteethat all would be well in the future—as well as a competent stenographer. Hopehad died in his heart; he would do no work for brethren of the orders he led.One thing he didn’t know about was that the very next day, far across the sea inRotterdam, O.T.O. member Leon Engers Kennedy, an artist, bid his wealthy father,Mozes Engers, farewell and set sail on the “Nieuw Amsterdam” (Holland-AmericaLine) for New York.Also that day, Hugo Münsterberg dropped dead at the Harvard women’s annex,Radcliffe. Were the gods on the job, or were they on the job?Crowley realized that he’d probably been stupid to try to push fate whereKeasbey was concerned. But he had lessons to learn. His first teacher was notexperience, whose fees can be very high, but the hotel maid Georgie, “a littlenegro girl.” When Crowley moaned to her that he had to go out to fetch aregistered letter, she told him she didn’t have to go out if she didn’t want to.The “madam” could go out herself! It was like a scene from Gone with the Wind.Talking of the Civil War, D. W. Griffith’s now controversial, thenextraordinarily popular, movie The Birth of a Nation, starring Lillian Gish, waspacking them in with its thrilling tale of the Ku Klux Klan, with prices reducedat the Tulane Theater, New Orleans. Crowley couldn’t afford a ticket.On December 22, as Christmas approached, he received a passionate wire from theMonkey, begging him to come to New York for the festive season. For some reason,Crowley did not heed the appeal; perhaps he suspected her husband’s hand in it.He would receive a letter from Coomaraswamy in January that convinced Crowleythe “Worm,” as he called him, was a “Black Brother.” Crowley confided to hisdiary that he was glad to have had the opportunity to study such a one closely.He kept up the strike. He was sure the masters had the ability to shape eventsin relation to his own awareness, and he did not feel he was simply punching theair. No, he was pitting himself against beings whose intelligence exceeded hisown as much as his did Hereward Carrington’s!—as he joked to himself. He had notlost his sense of humor. The night after Christmas—five days after he recordedreceiving £5 from Cowie and that Hugo Münsterberg had dropped dead in class—heasked: “What is man? A soap-bubble blown by a spermatozoon,” then ten minuteslater, added, “Yet every act we do, however foolish or futile, goes branching onfor eternity—an infinite heritage.”5 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt452] So hereally ought to have been watching his step where the gods were concerned.Indeed, the following day, resigned at having made his protest and having paidhis debts, Crowley picked up the cudgels of life and decided to work again. Hehad neither proper paper, nor money to buy it. He had seventy cents."},{"pageContent":"TWENTY-SIXimage [images/9781620556313_099.jpg]The Butterfly NetThe year 1917 would see a turnaround in Crowley’s fortunes, as it would thefortunes of the world. By summer, the United States had entered the World War;by Christmas, a defeated Russia collapsed in chaos: revolution hit with hammerand sickle.On January 2, with Crowley languishing in Louisiana, painter Leon Engers (FraterT.A.T.K.T.A.) arrived in New York. Immigration records give his destination asthe Equitable Trust Company, which company, part of the Morgan “syndicate,” hadin 1915 moved into the brand-new, dizzying, forty-story Equitable Building at120 Broadway, between Pine and Cedar Streets. Neoclassical, double-towered, theEquitable cast a seven-acre shadow and boasted more window space than anystructure in Manhattan, with the largest floor area of any building in theworld, but whether Engers occupied any of it, at least on arrival, isunknown.*126 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft126]According to Richard Kaczynski (Perdurabo, 258, 313), Engers joined the Aimage[images/dots.jpg]Aimage [images/dots.jpg] in London on September 23, 1912. Theprevious December, John Middleton Murry (1889–1957), editor of Rhythm, sent acopy of Victor B. Neuburg’s Triumph of Pan to Katherine Mansfield (1888–1923)for review (Rhythm 2, no. 2 [July 1912]: 70). Mansfield inquired as to Neuburg’swhereabouts. According to Murry (January 27, 1912), Neuburg had quarreled withCrowley, who was now with “Kennedy.”1 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt453] Neuburgand Crowley did not in fact part until early 1914. Crowley made “Kennedy”Patriarch Grand Secretary General of the Ancient & Primitive Rite, Great Britainand Ireland, at a Convocation of the Sovereign Sanctuary of Memphis and Mizraimat 33 Avenue Studios, 76 Fulham Road, June 30, 1913 (Kaczynski, 262), anddedicated poetry in The Equinox to Engers.image [images/9781620556313_060.jpg]Fig. 26.1. Leon Engers’s “psychochromes” announced in the Fort Wayne Journal,January 1919 (image courtesy of Frank van Lamoen)It is perhaps coincidental that in 1916 the very wealthy Mozes Engers’simport-export firm (“Firma M. Engers”) had its Dutch offices and ware-house(from 1910) at de Boompjes 70b,*127 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft127] alongRotterdam’s dockside, next door but one to the Uranium Steamship Co. Ltd:headquarters of Mansfield Cumming’s British intelligence network in neutralHolland, MI1c, at 76 Boompjes. Between them stood the De Nederlandse Bank at72–74, which had a policeman guarding the front door, according to author EdwinRuis.2 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt454] As Ruis states, generally speaking, weonly know about unsuccessful spies. Presumably, Engers’s contact address in NewYork was linked to his father’s business (Mozes had homes in Rotterdam, andKurfürstendamm 24, Berlin). In 1911, Firma M. Engers also had branches inLondon, Hull, Hamburg, and Bremen. It is interesting that Crowley in hisConfessions maintained that Engers had morally degraded himself somehow sincetheir last meeting, but this may simply have meant that Engers had what Crowleyconsidered unsuitable romantic attachments, as Crowley was curiously critical ofEngers’s wife, whom Engers married in May 1919. Perhaps Crowley would have likedEngers for himself.The day after Engers’s arrival, the Fatherland published what was probably themost devastatingly effective piece of “disinformation” propaganda Crowley everproduced. Appearing prominently as its first-page editorial, Delenda EstBritannia (“Britain must be Destroyed”)3 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt455]purported to be a review of Count Ernst zu Reventlow’s hateful anti-Britishbook, The Vampire of the Continent, recently delivered to New York to theFatherland on the Deutschland. German naval officer Reventlow was a militantexpansionist committed to U-boats and extreme measures. He loathed England,seeing her as Germany’s greatest enemy, during and after the war.4[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt456] The editor introduced Crowley’s “prologue andepilogue to The Vampire of the Continent” by informing the reader (again) thatCrowley was a Cambridge-educated Irishman and “poet of fine distinction” (“thefirst metrical artist in English since Swinburne,” attributed to Austin Harrisonat the English Review).Crowley went to town with the material at hand, enthusiastically egging on vonBernstorff to approve the unleashing of unrestricted submarine warfare (whichwould tip the scales for America’s entry into the war), ascending new heights ofthe ridiculous, such as, for example, that all Englishmen, because islandersused to snatching fish, were compulsive “pirates” whose country would become aGerman colony! “England,” Crowley insisted, “must be divided up between thecontinental powers. She must be a mere province, or better still, colony of herneighbours, France and Germany. Peace with England at this time would be a crimeagainst humanity.—We must die, that humanity may live. Now there is only one wayto destroy the power of England: the country must be conquered. . . . There isonly one way to do this: it is by ruthless prosecution of submarine warfare.”Germany must build more submarines; “if it takes ten years—or one hundredyears—it must be done. From the broadest standpoint of humanity, nothing else isreally worth doing. Let Germany make peace with France and Russia—if we musttalk peace . . . that she may be able to concentrate her whole power against thevampire.” Crowley ludicrously describes the method for killing vampires utterly.“If one precaution is omitted, the vampire lives again, to prey upon theinnocent and the just. Britannia est delenda [Britain must be destroyed].” Theissue went on to advise that “The Vampire of the Continent may be procuredthrough the Fatherland, price $1.35 postpaid, per copy.”Crowley boasted of the article’s impact in his Confessions.The argument [of the article] is quite in the style of a real German professor.I advocated the “Unrestricted Submarine Campaign.” I secretly calculated,rightly as the gods would have it, that so outrageous a violation of all lawwould be the last straw, and force America to throw off the burden ofneutrality.My German friends were loud in their congratulations. It was confidentlywhispered among the cognoscenti that von Bernstorff ’s judgment swayed at itsimpact. He withdrew his objections to that brutality, that insane savagery thatbrought America into the war.But there’s a tick in every sleeping-bag. My countrymen stayed right with me tothe finish! In what high glee did I not keep my secret rendezvous with a friendfrom a certain British consulate, waving my article, and crying, “The damnedfools have printed it—and it’s going to turn the trick!”*128[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft128] He read it; his face fell; he turned disgustedlyand growled, “I didn’t know you were a German.”5 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt457]“Berlin Orders Ruthless U-Boat War; Puts Rigid Limit on American Ships;Washington Fears Break Will Follow”—so thundered the New York Tribune onFebruary 1, 1917. The next day President Wilson was reported ready for “FinalAction”: “Ultimatum to Germany expected as Next Move—Bernstorff Still at Post;Hasn’t Prepared to Leave.” On February 2, Washington announced the certainty ofa rupture in diplomatic relations with Germany; this had always presaged war.Crowley’s diary for that day used Enochian code to convey the message “USA image[images/img_005.jpg] [symbol of Mars = War] Germany—success.” In his Magus diaryThe Urn, Crowley wrote for February 2, “My 2 ¼ years’ work crowned with success;USA breaks off relations with Germany.” Germany’s official warning to the UnitedStates, presented by von Bernstorff to Secretary of State Lansing on January 31,which rescinded all previous understandings while declaring Germany would forits “own survival” mount unrestricted submarine warfare involving summarytorpedoing of any suspected ships, without warning, was the last straw that gaveCrowley’s summary apologia its title. Crowley’s diary notes prove hislongstanding intentions and record his belief that his efforts had encouragedBerlin to believe that the United States could be cowed because the Americanpeople would not vote for war. Indeed, they probably would not have, but thecountry backed the president, who would never put the question to thepopulation.On February 14, sensing the wind, the Fatherland changed its name to the NewWorld on the principle of “My country, right or wrong; if right to be keptright; if wrong to be set right (Carl Schurz)”: the country being America. OnApril 6, America declared war on Germany, the government announcing that thenavy would be tripled in size, and an army of a million would be raised to fightthe “military state” that the day before was accused of fomenting war in Mexicoagainst the United States.While the diplomatic storm gathered over Washington and Berlin, pennilessCrowley relaxed into the damp and soft airs of low-lying New Orleans and let hisimagination rip into a Simon Iff novel he had begun on January 15, tentativelycalled The Butterfly Net. He wrote like a demon. In the three months beginningJanuary 14 he not only hammered into his first novel but also penned six SimonIff short stories (nearly 50,000 words), an essay, three other short stories, anunfinished quasi-fictional homosexual autobiography (Not the Life and Adventuresof Roger Bloxam, unpublished), some minor things, and a treatise on thegovernment of the O.T.O. for second-degree members. Taking the mick out ofhimself, he said this all gave “the other masters” opportunity for a good laughat his expense, for had he not struck, complaining work was “hampered” bycircumstances?The Butterfly Net pitted sleuth Simon Iff and white magician Cyril Grey againsta circle of wicked “Black Brothers” who do everything they can to preventCyril’s dream of incarnating an ethereal lunar spirit in a young lady, Lisa laGiuffria, for the betterment of humankind. It would have made an excellent“Hammer” movie with a sympathetic director and cast (being not a million milesaway from the successful Rosemary’s Baby, 1968, though with a reverse plotline),and who knows, it may yet. Crowley’s feeling for the Allied cause is notablethroughout, and there are some effective scenes set in wartime command centerson the Western Front, consistent with the “author’s note” written in London in1929 that opens a work whose first publication called for a new title, Moonchild(Mandrake, 1930), rather than The Butterfly Net.The book was written in 1917, during such leisure as my efforts to bring Americainto the War on our side allowed me. Hence my illusions on the subject, and thesad showing of Simon Iff at the end. Need I add that, as the book itselfdemonstrates beyond all doubt, all persons and incidents are purely the figmentof a disordered imagination.Moonchild opens with an unusual and strangely moving sketch of London (one feelsa hint of nostalgia in Crowley’s mind, perhaps thinking of old haunts whilenursing an absinthe in faraway New Orleans) and closes with a stroke of geniusas a German battlefield plan is thwarted by Crowley-like Cyril Grey’s reading ofGerman psychology, resulting in an Allied victory because the French generallistens to advice the British have rejected, because the British rejected it!Care to guess what that’s all about?Many of the characters are based on the Beast’s familiars. Lord Anthony Bowlingplays a significant part; he is a fictional version of the Honorable EverardFeilding. Lisa de Giuffria is Mary d’Este; Lavinia King is Isadora Duncan;Douglas is Samuel Mathers; Sister Cybele is Leila Waddell; Mahathera Phang isAllan Bennett; Wake Morningside is Hereward Carrington; Dr. Balloch is Dr.Edward Berridge of the Golden Dawn; Gates is William Butler Yeats; and numerousother acquaintances, friends, and opponents of Crowley are depicted in a novelthat furnishes the reader with a theory of “modern occultism.” It is hard not tolike it because it is easy to enjoy.The same goes for Crowley’s other Simon Iff stories, such as Nebuchadnezzar,which has Paul Powys as the real Otto Kahn, and Mollie Madison as Jeanne RobertFoster.“I am always bothering you,” murmured Miss Mollie Madison, apologetically. “Youare,” admitted Simon Iff; “but I suppose I am old enough to like it.”It is possible that he might have tolerated her even had he been young. Therewas never hair so plentiful, so irrepressible or so golden red as hers; and itframed a face warm, creamy flushed, round and innocent and laughing as a Greuze,with an impudent nose, and a mouth, perpetually pouting, which was redder eventhan her hair. Her body was slim and snake-like, every gesture sinuous andseductive. And she had no trace of self-consciousness or vanity. She never put aprice on herself, but gave freely as a queen should do.6[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt458]Crowley seems to have come to terms with his feelings over Jeanne, who a fewpages later he/Simon Iff addresses more directly, in Latin: Mollior cuniculocinaede! “Mollie! Fuck-doll softer than a rabbit!” Ah! There’s love!Four days into The Butterfly Net, Crowley reflected on card games he’d playedwith himself at Lake Pasquaney—scat, piquet, and bridge—and where he’d come upwith a variant of auction bridge he called “pirate bridge” (with his Fatherlandreview in mind, perhaps). Crowley’s surviving magical diary, whose cover bears agold Baphomet stamp on its cover,*129 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft129] indicatesthat on November 3, 1916, he had made an agreement with U.S. cards expert R. F.Foster that he was to share 50 percent of the profit if the game was marketed.Crowley sent his idea to Frank Crowninshield at Vanity Fair, suggesting thatVanity Fair Publishing bring in cards expert R. F. Foster to define the rules.Crowninshield went with the idea and ran a monthly article about it. PirateBridge became a mild sensation, under Foster’s name; Foster even published abook about it that year—but as far as is known, not a cent went Crowley’sway.†130 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft130]Desperate, yet resigned to the hard lesson the Secret Chiefs were, he believed,teaching him—that is, how the world really looked to the average socialoutsider—Crowley wrote a plaintive, moving letter from New Orleans to editorJohn O’Hara Cosgrave.323 Dauphine Street,‡131 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft131]New Orleans 26 January 1917My dear Cosgrave,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the lawI’m sending you an article which Frank Crowninshield thought might suit you. Ido hope so; I have struck a bad patch, and have been starving for a month.If you could spare me $50 for the article, or as a personal loan which I canrepay as my royalties on “Pirate Bridge” come in, I shall take it very kindly.It would enable me to get on from here to some friends who have offered to putme up for a month or so.*132 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft132]I have written over 100,000 words fiction in the last month. The Metropolitan isinterested in me, and talks of taking up my work wholesale (this is confidentialto you) but in the meanwhile I am up against it as I never was before.†133[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft133]Do let me have a line, and if humanly possible a check, by return mail. If I canonly get away from here I’ll be all right; but in this place I get deeper inevery hour.Let me have good news of you, moreover. If all goes well, I’ll turn up in April,and will hope to see you.Love is the law, love under will. Yours very truly, Aleister CrowleyThe article should illustrate extremely well; you may think it needs paddingout; if so, fiat. A.C.7 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt459]Unless “Eleanore Jackson” was particularly generous, Crowley must have had somemoney in his pocket, because he performed the IX° degree with her on January 31,dedicating himself “to be High Priest of the Most Holy Phallos.” The longabstinence from such operations was “due to complete absorption in creativework”; even so, it was, he thought, fairly good with excellent mentalconcentration.8 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt460]Crowley strolled five blocks southeast down to the wide Mississippi, where anunusual hypothesis struck him amid the humidity. Could it be significant thatsuch a combination of damp and soft airs always bred the “Taoist passive-lovetype of mysticism”?9 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt461] He cited as illustrationsof his theme the birth of Taoism in the Yangtze delta, Buddhism in the Gangesvalley, Sufism in the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates, and Christianity’s“languid, mystic bits” mostly in Alexandria in the Nile delta. And Mormonismtoo: Was that not invented in the Mississippi valley? He thought the theme couldbe worked up, comparing religions born in the plains and on heights. Perhapsthese thoughts inspired him that first day of February for his late afternoonencounter—devoted to “Magical Energy”—with “Sister,” a “big black muscular negrowhore,” which effort brought “immediate success.”10[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt462] Next day, Washington broke off diplomaticrelations with Berlin.After one more trip into “Sister’s” sultry boudoir, Crowley left New Orleans onFebruary 9 for a very different world: Titusville, Florida."},{"pageContent":"TWENTY-SEVENimage [images/9781620556313_099.jpg]Suffer the Little ChildrenAn erudite, artistically sensitive, anticonformist genius like Crowley wasunlikely to have found solace in Titusville, Florida, in February 1917. Onemight associate the state with incessant sunshine; one might be wrong. A weekbefore Crowley arrived (February 9), freezing weather had hit Florida from thenorthwest astride a 60 mph gale. Temperatures dipped from -6° to -12°F. Fruitgrowers assessed damage in millions of dollars wrought by frosted citrus fruit,especially in South Florida; Dade County being hardest hit. Temperatures in thelow 20s and driving rains followed the ruinous two days of deep freeze. And oneneed hardly guess what business Crowley’s cousin Lawrence Bishop was in.Situated midway between Fort Lauderdale in the south and Jacksonville in thenorth, Titusville squats across the Indian River from what is now the KennedySpace Center, something undreamed of in 1917, when most airplanes were biplanesmade of wood and canvas. Lawrence and Birdie Bishop lived with their twochildren at a citrus grove about fifteen miles north of Titusville itself, onthe remote-feeling east bank of the St. Johns River.To explain the relationship, Crowley’s mother, Emily Bertha née Bishop, was thedaughter of Elizabeth née Cole, second wife of John Bishop. Crowley’s cousinLawrence Bishop (1872–1961) was grandchild of John Bishop and first wife,Joannah. Lawrence’s father William had emigrated from England to the UnitedStates, where his son Lawrence met and married Kentucky-born Birdie Love(1876–1956). In Crowley’s imagination, the Bishops of Titusville became the“Thorpes” of his Simon Iff story, Suffer the Little Children. The story’s titlegives a good idea of its content, as Crowley gives a devastatingly sad pictureof children growing up under grim weights of low expectation and repressiveprejudice. Crowley’s Mr. and Mrs. Thorpe are not the age of their realcounterparts, but one can feel Crowley’s gathering disgust with what he found inhis description of the place and its residents.Thorpe’s grove is ten miles from the next inhabited dwelling. He employs severalmen to work for him. . . . Thorpe is a bluff bearded fellow of fifty or so; hiswife Birdie is not yet thirty. They are intensely religious, devoted to I don’tknow quite which of the warring sects of Baptist. The grove is a large andflourishing concern; Thorpe has plenty of money in the bank, and owns realestate in Titusville to a considerable value. A rich man for these parts, youmay say. . . .The house stands on the east bank of the river; access from the west is almostimpossible—the stream is shallow, a mere trickle over thick banks of soft mud;it flows through many and changing channels; the swamp extends for many miles. Arough track leads through thick jungle to the grove; thence it becomes a littlewider and smoother as it winds towards Titusville.1[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt463]Crowley disliked intensely the Bishops’ conversation, an acrid blend ofcapitalism, materialism, and religion. Simon Iff, contemplating the inhabitants,was driven to cynical song.What though the spicy breezesBlow soft o’er Titusville,Though every prospect pleases,The people make me ill.“Do they ‘bow down to wood and stone?’” laughed Miss Mollie Madison. . . .“They do,” said Iff.“But surely they are Christians?” tittered Mrs. Mills, with surprise.“They are,” crashed the magician. “They worship wood in the head, and stone inthe heart.”“Oh dear!”2 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt464]Crowley was particularly concerned about the effect of their life on the threechildren—Mamie, Alma, and Russell—whose constant cry, according to Crowley, was,“I don’t want to grow up to be like mother!” The boy was withdrawn, driven to“secret indulgence in the most wretched vices” while his sisters were drudges tothe thought of being married off at eighteen, old and wrinkled and wan throughabuse at twenty-five, when at least one had a voice that would make her a queenanywhere else, and all had innocent aspirations constantly thwarted. They werespied on, discouraged from seeking education by which they might escape from the“swamp” and its crocodiles, animal and human. “I cannot think of Florida,” wroteCrowley in his Confessions, “but in my ears rings the exceeding bitter cry ofpoor little sixteen-year-old Alma, ‘I’ve found it doesn’t pay to tell thetruth.’”3 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt465]Add to that he was fed on “offal” (presumably chitlins, or pig’s intestines),even though Lawrence had visited the family in England and knew an Englishmanwould not “be expected to eat such garbage,” but it was all in tune with what hecalled the “mean malice of this hag.” What can you do with suffering? Turn itinto art. Crowley got his revenge on Birdie in his Simon Iff story.Perhaps fortified by XI° devotions of “Glory to God!” with Titusville prostitute“Maddie” on March 5, and not being an entirely ungrateful visitor, Crowley, byexercise of will, held back a bad frost that would otherwise have destroyed thefamily’s groves.March 6. Threatened severe frost. I averted same, to repay my cousin for hishospitality. The Operation was very remarkable. I went out at noon, in bittercold and high wind; and I willed. I then slept very deeply for three hours, andwoke in still, warm weather, with the sun shining. The forecasts had givenseveral days of cold; and forecasts in America are very different to those inEngland; they rarely go wrong.4 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt466]Crowley spent his remaining time in Florida finishing off The Butterfly Net,editing O.T.O. religious rituals, and deepening his understanding of his grade.Then, on the night of Wednesday, March 28, Crowley received a letter from FraterFiat Pax (“Let there be Peace”); that is, O.T.O. treasurer George Macnie Cowie,in London. Crowley’s eyes darted across the letter’s contents with mountingalarm.It was only on Saturday last that I [Cowie] learned the cause of the recentaction of the authorities, and of which I was in absolute ignorance. It has comeas a severe shock. I assume you know, though you could not have meant that useto be made of your stuff. I learn that it is only my known probity of characteretc. etc. which has satisfied the authorities, etc. Otherwise, I have no doubtthat we should have been closed down . . . until you vindicate yourself, aspromised me, and can return to England, etc.5 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt467]The authorities had informed Cowie that the British Order Head was a traitor,working for the Germans in America. The action referred to was a police “bust”of the O.T.O.’s meeting rooms, 93 Regent Street in London’s West End. That theOrder’s Outer Head, Theodor Reuss, was a German, also (as it happened) involvedin his country’s clandestine activities, was no help. Present at the bust, MaryDavies, lodge master and fortune-telling “spiritist,” was arrested, it beingillegal to ask questions of the departed lest military secrets be inadvertentlyrevealed.Presumably ignorant of the fact that his name had been bandied about the Homeand Foreign Offices since the previous June, or that a Scotland Yardrepresentative had interviewed his Aunt Annie in Croydon, Crowley wonderedwhether the fuss was belated action stimulated by Everard Feilding, at Crowley’srequest in 1915, to convince the Germans that Crowley really was persona nongrata in England. If so, the plan had backfired calamitously. Crowley may nothave known that Feilding had been in the Middle East for more than a year onintelligence work.Flabbergasted at what looked like Crowley’s treachery, Cowie, as treasurer,intended to sell off all O.T.O. property, including Crowley’s house at Boleskine(mortgaged in the British Order’s name), whose location had a place in O.T.O.ritual as the Order’s “Kaaba,” or orientation. Financial plans, agreed upon withCowie shortly before leaving for the United States in 1914, were blownasunder—this on top of everything else!Crowley confided to his diary:A new and powerful impulse arrived last night, a letter from Fiat Pax. TheStupids have misunderstood my whole attitude, and raised trouble. Now I godirect to Washington to straighten this out; if I fail this time to get them tolisten to sense, at least I can go to Canada and force them to arrest me. Myhand is therefore at last upon the lever.6 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt468]Crowley quit Titusville at 8:03 a.m. on March 29, possibly for the Britishembassy in Washington. It seems likely that a key, surviving document from theperiod belongs to Crowley’s efforts to get a Washington contact, or contacts, toput the “Stupids” in London right about his “attitude,” and about his attemptsto secure backing from Guy Gaunt for intelligence beneficial to the Allies. Itmay also be the case that Crowley was already actively cooperating with WilliamWiseman’s MI1c networks but that, to protect their intelligence loop (one mustalways assume the possibility that other loops have been subverted by theenemy), Crowley’s actual position had not been conveyed to London—this wouldmake sense—and further, British Naval Intelligence was not lending itsinformation (via Feilding) on Crowley to Mansfield Cumming (“C”) in “MilitaryIntelligence,” soon to become the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS). As Cumminghad good working relations with Basil Thomson, Head of Special Branch atScotland Yard, it should have been, in theory, a relatively straightforwardmatter to get Cumming to request of Thomson that the Home and Foreign Offices“leave off” Crowley, and this seems to have occurred at some point beforeCrowley returned openly and uninhibitedly to England in 1919.THE AFFIDAVITCrowley’s typescript affidavit, subtitled “Memorandum of My Political Attitudesince August 1914,” reviews his motive and his activities since 1914. He firstdeals with “Motive,” making it clear that he is not in fact Irish nor hasanything in common with Germans.My parents on both sides come of families resident in England for over 300years. I was born and educated in Great Britain. My home is there. My family andproperty (both personal and real) are there. My business is there.I have never been to Germany, except to pass through it on my way to or fromRussia, Scandinavia, or Switzerland. I speak very little German, scarce enoughto talk to waiters and guides! And I cannot read even a newspaper. I have noGerman friends whatever, save one with whom I correspond on religious matters. Ihave met many German tourists. I dislike their manners, their habits, and theirlanguage. I have nothing to hope from Germany. I could not and would not livethere. There is therefore no possible motive for any disloyal action on mypart.7 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt469]He then, point by point, accounted for his contact with, and attempt tomanipulate his situation with Viereck. His “violent articles” werea) to discredit the German cause by committing the enemy to manifest absurditiesand infamies,b) to induce the Germans to give me their full confidence,c) to rouse the indignation of the Americans,d) to warn England of certain of her own weaknesses by exposing them, i.e., showthe enemy’s cards (note in particular articles on the submarine, forecastingboth the improvements in the U-boat, and the ruthless campaign).8[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt470]Crowley trusted that it would now be perfectly clear that his motivationthroughout had been “to serve my country.” Though Everard Feilding had approvedof his idea to subvert the Fatherland, “My method may have been mistaken; if so,I am willing to accept rebuke or punishment. I am perfectly ready to do myutmost in the future as in the past to serve England.”9[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt471] A list of his twenty-seven propaganda articlesfollowed, with the essential intention of each briefly stated. A “Memorandum”then summarized his activities, beginning with, “I, Aleister Crowley, am ofBreton-Irish family, settled in England since 1500. I am a life member ofTrinity College, Cambridge.” Of his trip west in 1915 he wrote, “I also took atour round the coast all through the West, and persuaded him [Viereck] thatnobody there cared about the war, except the Germans, who were ready for civilwar at need. The idea in all this was to encourage Germany to brave the U.S.A.and so force the breaking-off of relations.” Regarding the “Delenda estBritannia” article of January 3, “I learnt informally that this article had thegreatest possible weight with von Bernstorff, persuading him that the generalsentiment was such that he could advise his government to take the next suicidalstep. The result is history.”10 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt472]Crowley then addressed the issue of what had apparently occurred in London.Apparently the Government at home have not all this information. I am head of amystical society, the O.T.O., with branches in every colony, and a social schemewhich I believe to be the only alternative to Socialism. In politics, by theway, I am of the old school of Pitt, Palmerston, or Disraeli.Early this year my representatives in London and Edinburgh were approached bythe authorities. I have no details, but a letter [from Cowie] of March 8*134[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft134] says: “It was only on Saturday last that Ilearned . . .”I decline to be represented as a fugitive, without some pretty good reason.Hence I approach you.11 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt473]Crowley then made an application for further intelligence work, emphasizing hiscontinued usefulness.My position is particularly good at this moment. I can pose as a martyr forTrewth†135 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft135] [sic] better than ever before. Iftherefore the British Government can use me, let it do so. If not, I can atleast repair the mischief done, whatever that may be; at least I suppose so.Whatever it is, it can only be something that rests on my supposed attitude, anddisclosure would presumably undo it.In the last resort, I shall go to Canada, and claim what is surely the firstright of every subject, to be tried for treason. I cannot allow the imputationto rest upon me that I am a traitor or a coward or both, unless I am under thedirect orders of the Government, and so certain to be exculpated one day. Inever forget that I am the only English poet now alive; the conclusion issomething obvious.Shoot.12 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt474]Crowley’s problems with British authorities dragged on. “The secret servicepeople, while considering my application for employment, asked a friend of mineto explain my attitude. ‘We don’t understand him,’ they wailed piteously; ‘wedon’t understand him at all.’ ‘Cheer up,’ said my friend; ‘you’re not the firstpeople to fail to understand Mr. Aleister Crowley!’”13[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt475] If I were to hazard a guess on who that friendmight have been, I should advance the name of Ambrose Raynes, whom WilliamBreeze considers a likely intelligence agent or asset working in Washington andNew York. His name appears in a one-page list of Crowley’s useful New York phonenumbers of 1917 (“Raynes—Chelsea 2265”14 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt476]). By1918, Raynes was Master of Adelphic lodge No. 348, New York, a regular“recognized” Masonic lodge with ties to the Metropolitan College of the SocietasRosicruciana in America. Crowley’s acquaintance, S.R.I.A. founder George WinslowPlummer (1876–1944), was one of Raynes’s close friends.15[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt477] The Chelsea exchange served the area around West23rd Street, Midtown Manhattan, a fairly short distance from where Crowley nowrested his fatigued and ailing head.Leon Engers had come to the rescue. Parking himself and his paints in a rudelyfurnished old garret at a rundown 164 5th Avenue, just south of Madison Park(the Empire State Building was unheard of), Engers kindly offered basicappurtenances for the Beast’s use.*136 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft136]Conditions were rough by Crowley’s standards—the place was decaying and had norunning water—but he never forgot Engers’s kindness. Dossing on a sofa,Crowley’s ordeal intensified, and he remembered the period of spring 1917 as“inexpressibly distressing.”16 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt478] His health brokedown, not surprisingly given all the pressure and financial worry, and it wasnot only physical. He also felt spiritually devoid of ambition or energy; hedrifted through long, featureless days, hardly eating. On consideration, hewondered if the reaction hadn’t simply kicked in from his extraordinarymega-turn-on of adrenalin that followed his taking of the “elixir of youth” theprevious summer. It certainly wasn’t “eternal youth”; the price was high.Engers’s own behavior did little to encourage the Beast, for while Engers had anample allowance from his family, he was always in debt, and the next installmentwas spent in advance. Crowley said Engers had never grown up, which should havegiven them much in common. Engers lived the life of the garret artist, somethingCrowley would one day himself emulate by necessity. Engers cadged a dollar hereand a dollar there—that was one thing, but one incident stuck in Crowley’s craw.The studio janitor was a crippled youth with a large family. Engers wentvirtually to his knees, imploring the pathetic-eyed fellow to lend him twodollars, and he, a millionaire’s son! Crowley made it his business to put somemoral spine in Engers, pushing him into getting on with painting and realizinghis ideals instead of wasting his time. In due course, Crowley promoted him,organized an exhibition and reviews, and basically launched him. Engers, for hispart, made several portraits of Crowley, one a “psychochrome” that took hisspiritual aura into the visual plane, and another complete portrait that todayhangs in London’s National Portrait Gallery.Despite Crowley’s judgment of Engers’s moral weaknesses, he wrote how Engers’sdecency toward him personally transformed the crude environment and itspecuniary poverty into a “paradise,” such was the spiritual effect of kindnesson a Beast who never expected very much from anyone.One friendship that began to bloom in the darkest days of 1917 was that enjoyedwith Louis Umfreville Wilkinson, born rebel and suave intellectual, to whomCrowley wrote at 13 East 43rd Street on April 20.My dear Dumfreville*137 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft137] [sic.]Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.Not materialist, dear bundle of sticks, but Buddhist; soon to Nibbana’sstainless peace shall come that whose complexities, realized as mere chancecombinations, consent to dissolution.. . . Dreiser†138 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft138] will bring his “sisters”—nothis, apparently, but each other’s. We can hardly start it before 4 o’ the clock;we shall catch the physiological cycle on its upward-moving run; and we shallgive lunch time to pass on . . . concerning its psychological state. I wouldhave helped you to a further and higher analysis. . . . You shall see (the Godsgrant it!) that Atman [soul] is Anatta [no-soul], and Anatta Atman, in the Tao.Hast read my ‘Book of Lies’? Nay? Then I’ll send it Wednesday—and you shall haveyour hands upon the testicles of Dragon Truth.Love is the law, love under will.à toiA.C.17 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt479]On April 22, with nothing going on to record in his diary but his dreams, andsuffering from doubt, “Events have been terrible—hopeless,” he entered ameditation that led him to the idea of Mercury as a healer. Then he laughed,“But I am Mercury,” at which he felt a kind of stab to the solar plexus, andrealized . . . Mercurius sum (the statement in Latin)—try it in Greek! Evenbefore consciously calculating the Greek gematria of “Ermes eimi,” he got themessage; it was 418. 418 was the “Magical Formula of the Aeon.”18[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt480]Curiously, in the Confessions, Crowley places this minor revelation as a coda toresuming work after the New Orleans “strike,” where it is most effective, for itwas so obviously a sign to him, an instant communication of the gods to hissoul, as if to say, “Yes, we’re here.”The Confessions narrative makes the insight a definite communication from theSecret Chiefs leading to a dismissal of doubt and an acceptance of the ordeal’snecessity; he ceases to fret. Placed historically in the garret on 5th Avenue,going through a depression, as he was, it becomes simply another incident, if amomentary respite. Down in the dumps with 5th Avenue blues, he even felt hisHoly Guardian Angel was skeptical of his complaints. “You’ve had the vision ofthe Universal Beauty—and what good has it done to you?” Crowley had no answer.“I must simply go on—down the Precipice!”19 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt481]But gradually, Crowley began to get better, though there was one particular blowthat even the news of America’s finally entering the war with the Allies onApril 6 could not assuage. Eight days after Wilson took the plunge, Crowley’smother, Emily Bertha, suffered a heart attack at her home in Eastbourne, Sussex.News of her death reached Crowley on May 6, two nights after he had dreamed ofit with a feeling of extreme distress. He wrote in his diary that he had oftendreamed she had died, “but never with that helpless lonely feeling.”20[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt482] Emily left all her money and possessions to herbrother Tom Bond Bishop and to members of her mother’s family, the Coles. Heronly son was bequeathed an old “Devonport” (sloping writing desk) from thedining room and small cabinet formerly belonging to Lady Berwick.21[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt483]Within six months of his mother’s death Crowley began drawing and then painting.His mother had painted. She used to have a painting she’d made of Lawrence andBirdie’s Titusville farm that she hung at home. I rather suspect it was theshock of the loss of his personal “Queen Victoria,” coupled with the experienceof living closely to a painter, that launched Crowley on his fascinating careeras a (mostly) part-time visual artist, a career explored in my book The Beast inBerlin.A rare letter of this dark night of the soul survives dated May 10, written toLouis Wilkinson, who cared enough to keep his correspondence. The handwriting ofthe original was, most unusually for Crowley, very poor: a clear indication ofphysical weakness, and perhaps some disorientation, though the humor ischaracteristically vigorous.Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.So you have not forgotten your function as Comforter. Tis the chief of pleasuresto hear of any one getting anything.The danger of taking anything at its face value (or indeed at any value at all)is really a terrible one. The chapter of the Book of Lies “Tennis-work” isindicated, twice daily after visions, in a little alkahest.*139[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft139]I enclose the dollar; I shall never have another, in all likelihood. Frame it,labeled accordingly. I want it known however one day that I once did pay someone back.Conviction grows that that elixir is the right one for you; so keenly await newsof new-old preparation.Love is the law, love under will. το µεγα Θηριον [To mega therion = the greatwild beast]22 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt484]In the wee small hours of Sunday, May 27, Crowley resorted to magick to see ifhe could help improve his dismal health. He chose to assist him Mary Lewinstein,a Latino prostitute of 221 West 130th Street (telephone: Morningside 8145).Perhaps the Beast sought something approximating to that “old New Orleansessence” that made Woody Allen put a red light-bulb in his bedside lamp to stirthings up with Diane Keaton in Annie Hall, because Mary’s address was bang inthe heart of Harlem.*140 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft140] “After a long time I amunable to fuck well,” wailed Crowley, who had now been ill since mid-March. Theoperation was bad from practically every conceivable angle, and yet itapparently got his health to turn the corner, at last.23[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt485] What is particularly strange is that his “Magus”diary (The Urn) records the reflections, apparently of his Holy Guardian Angel,Aiwass, made shortly after the operation.My health has been constantly bad—a mixture of swamp fever and rheumatism,fugitive neuralgic symptoms, etc.—at least I most sincerely hope so, i.e. fromA.C.’s point of view. But I myself איואס [“Aiwass” written in Hebrew] have beenconsidering all the time how to act as to Crowley’s body and mind. Can I use itany more?Wouldn’t my ideas get ahead much faster if he were dead?Shouldn’t I be wise to manifest in another, or in a multitude?This practice has been nightly for some few days—I dare say ten. It has helpedgreatly my poor client Crowley, who now sees the point of the Buddhistcorpse-meditations and their congeners.24 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt486]Crowley seems to have been half expecting to die, with Aiwass almost gloating onthe wretched instrument. A few weeks later, Crowley’s becoming-a-Magus diaryrecords another remark suggesting a degree of mental disassociation, a removalof consciousness from his mundane, poorly self (“AC” or “Crowley”) into anextradimensional Self, or “Unconscious” Self attaining consciousness in theinstrumental ego. Indeed, Crowley (or is it Aiwass?) makes this unusualcondition of mind(s) account for the confusion about him experienced,presumably, by persons concerned with his essential loyalties. One would doubt,however, whether his explanation would have helped his case. Had interlocutorsever heard the following reasoning, the natural conclusion would have been thathe was mad, self-deceiving, or plain deceptive.I am getting quite to the point of habitual recognition of myself as איואס[Hebrew: Ayvas = Aiwass] and it does much good. But I have seen lately thedanger of having a mental machine which functions so independently of the Self,and even of the human will. E.g., all my sympathies are most profoundly with theAllies; but my brain refuses to think as sympathizers seem to do; so in argumentI often seem “pro-German.” Similarly, I have a Socialistic or Anarchistic brain,but an Aristocrat’s heart; hence constant muddle not in myself, but in otherswho observe me.One catches oneself assuming that A.C. [?] has some importance to something,that this bundle of sticks is worth keeping tied, for example. It is hard toexpress how deep and subtle this has become; as a matter of fact, my brainconstantly baulks at the analysis. “Change” is the special subject of a Magus;and all terms seem to have become entirely fluid. I must confess to moralparalysis, by the way; hope has been practically extinguished, and I now realizehow hard it is to work without that insidious drug. One doesn’t want to take achance any more; the thought of wasting energy has become insuperable; I canonly do a thing when I am sure of the result, or very nearly so. My life-workseems to have gone to utter smash at the exact moment when it was to haveflowered. And this also pertaineth unto the Grade of a Magus, and I giveSalutation to the Prophet of Allah, for like unto his case is mine also.25[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt487]A Freudian analyst, unacquainted with the special ordeals of becoming a Magus,might conclude that Crowley was experiencing a kind of “transference,” takingrefuge from unbearable feelings in his “superego,” where responsibility has beentransferred, and might suspect the patient of being on the verge of a completemental breakdown. Fortunately, or arguably unfortunately, for Crowley, he hadthe magical work ethic, and he let magick take the lead in getting him out ofthe impasse."},{"pageContent":"TWENTY-EIGHTimage [images/9781620556313_099.jpg]The InternationalCircumstances changed. Crowley attributed it to two factors. First, hecalculated that a new Chokmah day (the fourteenth) began on June 9, and in hisConfessions makes that mark the period over which the previous wilderness endedwhen new “officer” Anna Katherine Miller, called the “Dog” after the Egyptianjackal-headed god, Anubis, a helper on his path, arrived.1[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt488] The dates however, on analysis, don’t tally up,as the first act of sex magick with the “Dog” did not occur, by his own record,until August 14, and Crowley was seldom backward about coming forward in suchmatters. As he had recently observed, the fact that men, perceiving women in thefirst instance as either “chaste” or “unchaste” “proves that cunt is the mostsignificant thing about them.” A personal joke to himself, possibly, but twomonths is getting on for a whole Chokmah period of seventy-three days.The other great change he attributed to three operations of the IX°. The firstwas that with Mary Lewinstein of Harlem on May 27, then two more performed onthe twenty-eighth and thirtieth of May, with Anita, “half prostitute, halfJapanese, half-Irish.” The latter two had as their Object “the Promulgation ofthe Law”—of Thelema, of course. In his Rex de Arte Regia diary, Crowley reckonedthat these operations resulted directly in his induction as contributing editorof the International, “with its occult matter,”2 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt489]“about six weeks later,” which is perhaps stretching it a bit. Crowley reckonedhe could expect success from these operations because they were “in actualharmony” with his whole karma—that is Will—and he could safely leave it “toThose invoked forces” to see to the details.3 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt490]In fact, a letter I unearthed recently at the Warburg Institute, London, rathersuggests that June 1917 was a period of personal crisis and may have been theproper time of composition of the defensive “Affidavit” quoted earlier. Severalthings point to this. Trouble is evident in a letter Crowley wrote to LouisWilkinson on Monday, June 25.Ta [thanks]: I deem I will come Wednesday morning: because I may be withdrawnfrom circulation at any moment now. The Call of the Wild is heard from SullivanCounty, for one thing;*141 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft141] I expect to go thereThursday, and (may be) met there.If not convenient, better wire.

I think ifI were quite sure that I were dying, and could be of no use at all any more as aconstructive force, I might end in a blaze of glory after all.Don’t put yourself out about my coming with elaborate preparations.

(but perhaps it is polite in this country).Yrs.A.C.4 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt491]Crowley wrote again to Wilkinson from 164 5th Avenue two days later.Ludovico mio,Où es-tu? Car je voudrais venir avant le fin du mois pour chercher un nid.[“Dear Louis, Where are you? Because I would like to come before the end of themonth to find a nest.”]’Tis playing hot here; I envy yourslush-slush-slush-slush. [Crowley then tells the story of things being so badfor French troops on the Western Front that, deprived of alcohol, they were now“distilling spirit from corpses.”] They admit it themselves; they even boast oftheir “esprit de corps,” as they call it.*143 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft143] Isaw Crowninshield [Vanity Fair], but he was too busy to talk about [parts?poetry?—illegible].5 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt492]After writing the above note to Louis Wilkinson, Crowley performed the IX° latein the evening with married Irish prostitute Helen Huljus, a “Libra-Cancer typewith a touch of Aquarius.” Aimed at “perfect physical health,” the operation was“grand,” in due course clearing up all physical troubles, save one. The “mentalaspect” of his problems dissolved completely, while his physical ailment wascontained.6 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt493] An entry of August 28 in The Urndiary offers his thinking on the problem that had obsessed him since April: asarcoma (cancer) of the tibia or shin bone.7 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt494]Early July saw little change in his situation. A McAlpin Hotel stationery cardconveys a plaintive message to Louis.The Butterfly Net [transcript] has arrived at last. I want you to be kind andread the MS, and tell me if it’s hopeless. I’m utterly miserable—lonely, ill,and penniless—but rather enjoying my self. I hope all’s well your way.When do I see you? That would indeed be joy. I really miss you a lot.À toi a prioriA.C.8 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt495]Finally, around the middle of July 1917, the tide turned. Viereck offeredCrowley a job: the first paid employment of his life. At a measly twenty dollarsa week, Aleister Crowley became contributing editor of the Internationalmagazine with an office at 1123 Broadway. There is a noticeable change of tonein Crowley’s next card to Wilkinson, written hurriedly on McAlpin Hotelstationery.I’m using your plea for better morals in this month’s International, and shallwant something for next month—one of those short stories, perhaps. We can’t paymuch yet, as you know, but it will be good for you to get your name up, don’tyou think? Anyway, come up and see me about it as soon as you can.Ring Farragut 9779 [Brooklyn] between 10 and 12 any day and you’re pretty sureto get me.. . . I’m very dull this morning—occupied, like Martha, with details of magazineconstruction. There’s going to be a hot Crime in the old town in about a month.I’m going to be a revolutionary with the whole show.So come up soon; amen so“A” [a very phallic, artistic A]9[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt496]When Crowley started reorganizing the International, he found a literarymagazine established in 1908, driven onto the financial rocks by its having beenused as a pro-German propaganda tool. The task, as he saw it, was to restore themagazine to eminence (if only with a very small circulation) in literary mattersand to make it a vehicle for the “revival of Magick,” a voice for the Thelemiccause. In this he had an advantage. Viereck baulked at paying reasonable moneyfor articles, which meant that Crowley had to humble himself asking favors, butwhere there was a shortfall (as there always was), Crowley made it up witharticles written by himself under a range of pseudonyms, from “Mark Wells” to“Edward Kelly,” from “Sheamus O’Brien” to “Jeanne La Goulue.” He might havetaken comfort from the story of how Samuel Taylor Coleridge exhausted himselfwriting most of the Friend newspaper in 1809. In eight months Crowley’s inputmade it a saleable commodity, despite the Canadian post office refusing to postit around the colony, and Viereck’s cheeseparing, which meant that Crowley couldnot even send remaindered copies to contributors lest the magazine incuradditional postage costs! Crowley received no pay for his own articles, and, ashe noted, he earned only two dollars more than his typist. But he loved it! Onefeels his confidence rise from the moment he submitted his first short story—“ADeath Bed Repentance”—in July’s issue.From 10 Davis Place, Rockaway Beach, Long Island, Louis Wilkinson sent Crowleyhis opinion of The Butterfly Net manuscript. Crowley replied from his office onJuly 19 on International-headed notepaper.Cher maître,I am overwhelmed with your letter of the 17th. I have been crying ever since. Ihad to go to Coney Island to celebrate. It is really awfully nice, and I onlyhope that other people will take your view.As for that of your flame-thrower, I am even more enchanted. I do really valuethat opinion more than anything, if only because it is not so much an opinion asan expression of real feeling. After all, we are great fools to analyze thebooks we read. All art operates by direct impression. Either you get it over, oryou don’t. If you start to criticize Eva Tanguay, you leave nothing at all.It is curious what you say about Lisa [La Giuffria] is exactly what Kennedy[Leon Engers] said. I could not in the least understand it because the characteris taken from life with considerable exactitude.*144[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft144] Talking it over with him, he got it down to thepoint of saying that his objection was that such a silly fool would not belikely to have such exalted visions. As a matter of fact, the visions wererather tacked on, but just as any looking-glass will reflect any image withoutcaring in the least what that image is, Hyperion or a satyr, and just as thoseimages leave no impression at all upon the glass, so it is with women.. . . this “butterfly net” is really only the overture to the “wonder-child”novel which I have not yet thought out in the least. You cannot expect me togive you two novels for $1.35. As a matter of fact, novel No 2 is a considerablebother to me because the first happens to be dated. Either I must lay the scenein some inaccessible vastness of the Himalayas or I must trust my frail bark tothe stormy and uncharted seas of prophecy.. . .

Silent parade of 10,000 black men, women, and children down FifthAvenue, New York CityOne wonders what Crowley and his host Leon Engers made of a poignantdemonstration of Saturday, July 28, when the NAACP*146[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft146] organized a silent march of ten thousand blackmen, women, and children down Fifth Avenue. Eerily, they marched past Crowley’sdigs behind a row of drummers carrying banners calling for justice and equalrights; the only sound: the beat of muffled drums.The demonstration was prompted by events of July 1 when two white policemen werekilled in East St. Louis, Illinois, during a struggle after marauders attackedblack homes. The attack sparked a race riot the next day. At its end,forty-eight lay dead, hundreds were injured, and thousands of blacks fled St.Louis while their homes burned, police and state militia doing little to preventthe carnage.“Every man and every woman is a star.”Meanwhile, John Cowper Powys’s condition deteriorated (see here[9781620556313_c21.xhtml#p386]), to Mr. and Mrs. Wilkinson’s concern. Usinggeomantic means, Crowley examined Powys’s chances, conveying his prognosis toWilkinson on July 29.I did a geomancy concerning Powys. There seems danger of death in the operation,but if he gets through, it should do a lot of good. Therefore taking the figureall round, it would be best to go ahead. But one is naturally shy about advisingin such a matter. Obviously I couldn’t be so direct to him, unless officiallyasked.I do hope to see you Wednesday 2nd [August].Why don’t you write short stories about Olga?11 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt498]Crowley tried again to get some copy out of “Dr. Wilkinson” on July 31.12[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt499]Sehr Geehrter Herr:I am sending you Tolstoi’s Journal with a note on the front with regard toreviewing it. I also want you to write some letters about that plea for bettermorals. It would be rather amusing to have an indignant letter from a Mr.Wilkinson, who was a clergyman, protesting against this personal attack.Doubtless other ideas will occur to you. They would to me, if I had a sea tobathe in.Yrs ever,ΓITΩN*147 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft147]On August 7 Crowley was bathing on Long Island, doubtless feeling the odd pangover his romance at Rockaway Beach with Jeanne, now two years past. He wrote toWilkinson as “O Disappearing Wonder,” since his friend had failed to turn upamong the crowds on the island.I do not know what happened to you on Sunday. I can only imagine that you didnot find the place and killed yourself in your disappointment.The place is Sea Side House just opposite Sea Side station, tel. Hammels 730.I am not coming to New York tomorrow, Wednesday, and I hope you will come overto seaside as early as possible.They do not like my review no 1 of which I sent you a copy so I have had towrite another one much duller, but, possibly better from the point of view ofselling the book which is a great thing.Thine, A.C.13 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt500]The International’s August edition included “Filo de Se,” a short story aboutsuicide written at Lake Pasquaney on July 30, 1916, during Crowley’s fetishcarving period. He also launched his “Revival of Magick” series, which ran untilNovember. The series opened well, full of startling, simple insights into thebusiness of modern magick. Nobody on earth wrote about magick as well as Crowleydid.“Magick then may be defined for our present purpose as the art of communicatingwithout obvious means.” Crowley gives due reverence to the Hermetic tradition of“as above, so below”: “in order to perform his miracle he must call forth hisown God in the Microcosm.” “Therefore the Magician cannot really perform anymiracle unless that be already the Design of the Universe. So that he who setsout by saying, ‘I will impose my will on all things’ ends ‘Thy will be done.’”14[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt501]Crowley liked to put his mouth where his magick was. On August 11 an operationfor success with the Simon Iff stories for the International was performed withAnita, followed two days later by fellatio with one “Lionel Q********,” whoseidentity is unknown (although the English form of “Leon” (Engers’s name) isLionel, and “Q” can stand for “K”); details of which were anywayprohibited—Crowley’s usual obscuring of homosexual acts.If we follow Crowley’s Confessions, it was shortly before this time that hisfriend “Maitland Ambrose Payne” (clearly Maitland Ambrose Trevelyan Raynes, whoWilliam Breeze surmises was a British intelligence agent or asset)15[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt502] directed him to a “Singalese joint” on 8thAvenue where the cook made real curry, a favorite dish of Crowley’s. Thepresence of Raynes in Crowley’s life is partly explained by shared religiousinterests and probably connected with Crowley’s attempt to regularize hisposition with British Intelligence in Washington and elsewhere. Anyhow, likingthe “joint,” Crowley revisited the establishment, and there he met his next“officer.”He describes Anna Katherine Miller as “a Pennsylvania Dutch girl, the onlymember of her family not insane,”16 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt503] which issuccinct if not very informative. Crowley’s additional comments about Anna donot satisfy. She was the fulfillment of a vivid dream of the previous yearpromising the appearance of a “brown girl” in his life; Anna not only resembleda dog to Crowley in some way but also possessed the virtues and vices of thecanine species; Crowley said her manners were such as to upset the “camp,” andshe stayed but a “Chokmah day” before a “sturdier” animal appeared. I think thatis all reflection well past the events and feelings of the time.In the meantime, August 14 was the date set for Anna and Aleister’s firstmagical, sexual encounter. Shortly before they broke the ice to the Object of“Love” at 6:30 p.m., Crowley wrote to Louis Wilkinson on fresh notepaper, headed“Office of the Contributing Editor.”Dear Wilkinson,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.. . . I do not think you should altogether blame me in the recent matter. Iremained in the trenches. It was, of course, mere accident connected with a redheaded girl named Kate [Seabrook, see here [9781620556313_c32.xhtml#p546]] thatlured the modern Rembrandt from New York.*148 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft148] Ireally do not know how it became known that I was in the district unless it waspurely divined from the presence of Kennedy.I do not quite understand about Ezra Pound and Yeats [WB or JB?]. I do not knowwhat the suspicions may be; nor is it necessary to inquire, since the wholematter is unfortunately pathological . . .Your article created quite a stir and we have had lots of letters thanking usfor it. It was certainly the feature of the August number. You ought to followit up. More Wilkinson will bring great success of every kind to the magazine.I cannot go with Freud to his limit or anywhere near it. For example; dreams (asfar as I’m concerned) have, nine times out of ten, nothing to do with wishes,but are caricatures of the events of the day before or evidently dictated by thephysical condition of the moment. [Crowley then asked Wilkinson to do morecritiques of Freud to generate controversy, and which could then be collectedinto a book.]Give my love to O’Neill when you write to him,*149[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft149] and turn up here as soon as you can.Yours ever,Aleister Crowley17[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt504]It is unusual to find Crowley mixing business with magick, but how else might weinterpret an operation with the Dog of August 17 following one the previousevening that sacrificed bliss (ananda) for knowledge (chit), aimed at “theDivine Knowledge”? At some point in the proceedings, with Anna Katherine Millerpaying lip service to the Lord Phallos, Crowley penned the following toWilkinson.I am being vampired by a lady with Scorpio rising and cannot think of the wordsof the benediction which begins “The Lord bless and keep you,” but consideryourself blessed! You might let me have news of Powys [John Cowper Powys]. I amvery anxious to hear that he is better.Yours for the libido,†150 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft150]Aleister Crowley18 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt505]He then asked: “What Magick should I work by means of the IX° O.T.O. upon thewoman [Miller] through whom I asked Divine Knowledge last night?”19[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt506] The Work of the morrow went on “all day long” tothe same Object.Crowley wrote to Wilkinson again on August 21.Awful jolly, dear old chappie, to hear from you again so soon. Very glad too ofyour good news both with regard to Powys, and the other matter.I shall be glad to get Shakespeare,‡151 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft151] but Iwant something in October of the definite propaganda type. We have to printthings that are likely to bring in money right away; and the only game is theUplift.Excellent critique of Freud.But it is quite absurd to say that if a man shoots himself and dies inconsequence that the only cause of death is the operation of the outraged ghostof his great grandmother. It is this that is really at the bottom of the troublewith German science.I must drop off, as the eminent Mr. Here ward Carrington has done me the honorto call at my humble office.Yours ever,Aleister Crowley20 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt507]The following morning (August 22) at 6:30 a.m. Crowley performed an operation“of long-since-unheard-of vehemence” per vas nefandum (“by the unmentionablevessel”) with the Dog, whose Object was, “to become the greatest of all theMagi.” The Elixir was “of miraculous strength and sweetness,” mentalconcentration “Samadhic in intensity.”21 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt508]Take this or leave it, but the very next day Charles Stansfeld Jones posted aletter from Vancouver in which an “enemy” of Crowley (a Theosophist) proclaimedCrowley as the greatest of all the Magi! Crowley would print the letter in the“Forum” letters page of October’s International.Sir:In answer to the question, “Can you tell us anything of the Great WhiteBrotherhood, known as the Aimage [images/dots.jpg]Aimage [images/dots.jpg],” Mr.Charles Lazenby, of the Theosophical Society, made the following remarks afterhis public lecture on Magic, at the Vancouver Labor Temple, July 31, 1917 E.V.The Aimage [images/dots.jpg]Aimage [images/dots.jpg] is an Occult Order having adefinite purpose, and was started by a man of immense power, perhaps thegreatest living. The place of this Great Being in the Occult Hierarchy is aprofound mystery, and he and his mission are causing a great amount ofspeculation at the present time.Judged by any ordinary standard, he is absolutely and entirely evil; he hasbroken his occult vows and all codes of morality, openly stating that he hasdone and will continue to do so. He may have a very great purpose in view.No living person perhaps has had such an influence on occult thought, andwrought so much therein. He has knowingly taken upon himself a tremendous karma,but what will be the ultimate result it is impossible to judge. To allappearance, as I remarked, he is the personification of evil.Later, during a private conversation, Mr. Lazenby continued:He is a very wonderful being: an ordinary man like myself has no possible meansof judging what his ultimate motive is.Looked at from known standards he is evil, but from a distance, in perspective,one may imagine he is taking this great karma for some definite end; he may bethe Savior of the World.In any case 300 years from now he will be looked upon as one of the World’sgeniuses.I should not care to have any part in his work myself. You have this toremember, however, that you are connected with a genuine Occult order, not apseudo-occult one such as [Max] Heindel’s and others which are worthless.What has the Master Therion to say about this?C.S.J [Charles Stansfeld Jones]22 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt509]On August 26, Crowley felt he had to pass on to Jones in Vancouver the outcomeof events taking place in the O.T.O.’s South African outpost, led by accountantJames T. Windram X°. Windram’s letter from “Baynards,” Innes Street, Observatory[astronomical telescope], Johannesburg, was addressed to “His Excellency SirStansfeld Jones X° O.T.O., Box 70, Vancouver.”We have had some difficulty in South Africa, one of the contributaries being themisfortunes of the London Lodge, which we who know very much deplore.Furthermore, the Swiss Manifesto was not well received in our Province [regardedas anti-Allied, German national, O.H.O. Theodor Reuss’s “Anational Manifesto”was, according to William Breeze, the real cause of the London raid]. In fact itbecame necessary for us to reply in the form of a Manifesto from this GrandAdministration. I am enclosing you a copy herewith.23[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt510]The South African O.T.O. did not like the anti-Allied tone of Reuss’scommunication, which ranted on about the nationalistic sentiments of the Allieswhile pushing for an O.T.O. of “Gnostic Christians” unencumbered by patrioticconsiderations. South African brethren considered the statement premature whilea good fight was being fought against a vicious German regime that would stop atnothing to secure its own victory.At 11:00 a.m. that day (August 26) Crowley began a magical operation with AnnaKatherine Miller to secure the “Siddhi,” or magical power, of the enlightened,while at the same time harboring the thought that homosexual magick (XI°) mighthave been more effective. Despite Miss Miller’s insidious weakness foralcohol—which he warned her about repeatedly, citing bitter experience with hisfirst wife, Rose—they had decided to live together in an apartment at 110thStreet, in the Morningside District, on Central Park West. Crowley regarded hisordeal as over, and on August 28 began “quite cheerfully making plans for the‘future’ which will probably never arrive.” He was ecstatic to be “livingtogether in a room on Central Park West, where we can see nothing but trees!”24[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt511] Their apartment was close to the cathedral ofSt. John the Divine; Crowley must himself have felt like the “beloved disciple”with a book of revelation.On August 31, Crowley and Anna performed Opus XXVI to gain the power of the“Eight Siddhis,” which Crowley was convinced related to the eight letters of hisO.T.O. title “Baphomet,” the “idol of the Templars.” On the same day he wrote,prosaically, to Wilkinson.I have just heard from Sheridan Bickers who wishes to be warmly remembered toyou. His address is 1634 Vine Street, Hollywoood, LA, California.*152[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft152] He wants you to write.25[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt512]SECRET SERVICE INTERVIEWAccording to Ellis Island records, Frederick Hall (aged 38), occupation“journalist,” and wife, Helen (aged 30), arrived at New York Harbor on board SSOrduña from Liverpool on September 1, 1917. According to the record, Hall’sdestination was his mother-in-law, Mrs. E. V. Rowe’s, home at Bellport, LongIsland. Four of the thirty names on the inventory were bound either forWashington’s British embassy or the British mission on Broadway; it looks like aBritish government charter voyage. The “British Government” footed the bill forFrederick Hall’s passage.Frederick Hall was most probably the man who interviewed Crowley, in apparentlydesultory fashion, in 1917 to ascertain his value to the British Secret Service.In his Confessions, Crowley gave Hall’s identity as “H . . . d,” but in theunabridged version the name is clearly “H . . . l,” while a handwritten noteattached to the manuscript gives the name as “Hall.”Frederick Hall joined Norman G. Thwaites and William Wiseman of MI1c at 44Whitehall, east of Battery Park and south of Wall Street.*153[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft153]According to Spence, Wiseman’s papers show that Hall was assigned to “generalwork,” connected to informants in the press and intelligence bodies.26[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt513] Crowley described his interview with Hall inConfessions thus:There was a Temporary Gentleman named H . . . d in the British MilitaryMission†154 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft154] with whom I had such dealings as ispossible with the half-witted. He thought that he detected hostility in myattitude towards him, whereas it was merely the University Manner. It was thispoor thing whom our secret service sent to interview me. I told him that I couldfind out exactly what the Germans were doing in America. I also told him that Ihad the absolute confidence, years old, of a man high in the German secretservice [Reuss]—that I could go to Germany in the character of an Irish patriotand report on the conditions of the country. (There was desperate need ofaccurate information as to Germany’s resources at this period.) He said, withthe air of one detected in the act of adultery by sixteen separate sleuths, tosay nothing of being doomed by the Black Hand, “But how do I know that you won’tgo straight to Viereck and tell him I have been to see you?”!!! I am loath torecord accents of human speech so eloquent of mental undevelopment. I said tohim, “What harm would that do? How would that save Bloody Bill from hispredestined doom?” He did not know the answer to that. But then, he did not knowthe answer to anything else.27 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt514]Crowley had answers, if anyone would but hear him. In September’s International,Crowley gave his opinion on the Irish situation in an article called “SinnFein,”28 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt515] attributed to “Sheamus O’Brien.” Onecannot help wishing it had been absorbed fully long before the “Troubles”enveloped the province in 1969.Whenever and wherever Irish and English meet as equals they are the best offriends. Their natures are opposite, but they fit delightfully, better I think,than any two other races in the world. It has been England’s salvation that shehas always had Normans or Celts for her real rulers. There is hardly a“Sassenach” in the government today. Yet no government has proved capable ofdealing with the Irish Question, for the perfectly sensible reason that itssimplicity has been misunderstood. Even Irishmen have misunderstood it.. . . Yet the question was and is perfectly simple. All Irish protests, whatevertheir appearance, meant one thing and one thing only: “Get off my face!”I have no patience with the Sinn Feiner who is out of temper, and regards theEnglish as monsters and devils. They are the most charming people in the world,and merely become monsters and devils when they try to deal with Ireland.The British rule in India has been a miracle of beneficence, under the mostappalling difficulties of climate, race, language, and religion. I have spentlong enough in India to know that. But India is not Ireland; for some uncannyreason, England always does the wrong thing at the wrong time.. . . Even pro-Ally Americans were shocked into indignation by the appallingtactlessness of murdering the revolutionists of Easter 1916; and when, notcontent with hanging Sir Roger Casement, who was, at the very worst anunbalanced crank of impractical idealisms, they proceeded to defile his memoryby circulating in secret, so that no one could challenge and refute it—analleged diary attributing to him just that very vice for which their own gang atDublin Castle, the men who stole the Crown Jewels, were notorious we simplyconcluded that the last trace of reason or of common sense had left theauthorities for ever.. . . The moment we are an independent republic like Canada or Australia or theSouth African Union there can be no further grievance. “We may fight amongourselves?” Well, that’s our business, not yours. (Besides, it’s a pleasure.)Until that day of Freedom we can do nothing but fight for it. We have had sevencenturies of England on our face, and we are desperate. We will use every means;all’s fair in love and war.. . . Free Ireland will see—with one glance at the map—that she can have onlyone friend, one ally—England. We are intertwined with the English quiteinextricably. The attempt to revive Gaelic is quite on a par with the Germanreaction towards Gothic type—does any sane Sinn Feiner expect his Americancousins to learn Erse?. . . Get off my face! Let me get up, and I’ll fight side by side with you. I’lllead your armies to victory, as in the past; I’ll replace your dummy officerswith men of brains. I have imagination, courage, wisdom—everything you lack—andit’s all at your service. But I can do nothing while you’re standing on myface.29 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt516]It was not all politics, thank God; September’s International launched “TheScrutinies of Simon Iff” upon an unsuspecting world, with his first adventure indetection, The Big Game, which, like many of the Iff stories, would makeentertaining TV, with the incomparable Anthony Hopkins as Iff.When not in the office, having to work in tandem with assistant editor JosephBernard Rethy and overseer Viereck, early September was devoted to magicaloperations with the “Dog Anubis” to uncovering the “Siddhi,” or spiritual gifts,suitable for Baphomet, whose eight letters, Crowley was convinced, indicatedeight appropriate siddhis consistent with his grade, beginning and ending withspiritual knowledge (gnana); pranayama, or “levitation” (breath control); powerto destroy; power to create; transformations; expansion to nuit (the infinitelygreat); contraction to hadit (the infinitely small). Crowley’s thought processesare always fascinating, whether or not on drugs. On September 3 he inhaled ethylether to analyze thoughts. He noted that ether made the body glow, but aftersexual magick, the glow stopped above the muladhara chakra, situated at thespine’s base and activating between perineum and coccyx. Crowley reckoned thespherical glow, which not being nervous in origin, did not branch, constitutedan argument for “auras.” “It is love that opens the gates of the heavens, willthat shuts those of the hells.”I got this as a flash of cosmic memory. As a rational corollary, I got: Love isthe power to say “yes”; will the power to say “no.” Cheap epigram leading toheresy; beware!My 9° = 2▫ consciousness is now quite fixed in the depths.There is a point in evolution where all the different lines of argument runtogether with a rush. I was identifying the eye of a potato with the Eye ofHorus, when all the other eyes joined in the dance! This always happens as theconsciousness expands, becomes erectile or enthusiastic, in the course of anygeneral resolution of propositions.Asked by Anubis, my dog-headed concubine, to say something else beautiful aboutlove, I replied: “Ill-temper is a disagreeable quality, but it never gaveanybody the clap.”30 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt517]Crowley’s love for Anna Katherine Miller was not lasting. Anna introducedCrowley to her friend, bohemian chemist Roddie Minor (1884–1979). Born atLawrenceville, Georgia, artistically cropped-haired Roddie was married tosculptor Bruno Louis Zimm, designer of the Slocum disaster monument and otherworks in Washington, D.C.*155 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft155] Crowley sawRoddie’s potential for Scarlet Womanhood and did not take too much time aboutit.Attending on broad-shouldered, full-lipped Roddie to succumb to his charms,Beast and Dog gave their all to “success to Kennedy’s psychochromes” onSeptember 18. True to his word, the Beast did what he could to drum upenthusiasm for Leon Engers’s visionary paintings in abstract spiritualidentity—painting the auras, or “souls,” of his sitters in relation to theirordinary appearance, as he saw it. Crowley wrote to Louis Wilkinson on October 1about his portrait by Engers, required for the exhibition Crowley was arrangingon the artist’s behalf.Dear Ghost,. . . I wish you would write to Kennedy and arrange to give him at least onemore sitting. He is a little shy about writing to you. . . . but a picture is apicture, and in the interest of art, which after all does exist, this one oughtto be finished.Very truly yours,A.C.31 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt518]Wilkinson was already doing what he could for Crowley, submitting a superbarticle, “Shakespeare: Rebel, Aristocrat and Pessimist,” for November’sInternational (11, no. 11) to a distinguished issue, under Crowley’s preciseeditorial policy.September drew to its autumnal close, and “Change” was on the mind of the Magus.With no new Chokmah day due until November 3, Crowley felt the signsnonetheless. Despite a cold, and liver chill, he confidently pondered, betweencoughs, the advantages of the master’s mind where change was concerned. “Everyphenomenon is a Change; all Change is interesting as such; therefore theUniverse is Joy. But the Idealist, with his Fixed God, is always disappointed.The Masters of Truth are the only happy men, though they constantly observe whatmen stupidly call Sorrow.”32 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt519]Anna’s idealism had its place. In the early hours of the twenty-eighth sheperformed her penultimate magical operation. Object: Roddie Minor’s body.

He described her as “Matron,” a “big muscular sensual type.”1[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt520] The IX° was appropriately dedicated toAphrodite, eternal mother of sex, and the passage of rite was what Crowleynicknamed “the Eye of Hoor,” the anus: a preferred orifice in Crowley’s case,and, of course, a more than adequate contraceptive. More vigorous ritesfollowed, including a particularly orgiastic session on Crowley’s forty-secondbirthday (October 12), with the aid of cocaine and brandy. This tied in nicelywith the lead article in October’s International, which just happened to be“Cocaine.” Never one to adhere to the “safety first” principle, Crowley,following an erudite discussion on the means humanity customarily employs todiscover “happiness,” concludes cocaine to be an almost universal elixir—thatis, tongue in cheek, not on line.Give it to no matter whom. Choose me the last losel on the earth; let him sufferall the tortures of disease; take hope, take faith, take love away from him.Then look, see the back of that worn hand, its skin discolored and wrinkled,perhaps inflamed with agonizing eczema, perhaps putrid with some malignant sore.He places on it that shimmering snow, a few grains only, a little pile of starrydust. The wasted arm is slowly raised to the head that is little more than askull; the feeble breath draws in that radiant powder. Now we must wait. Oneminute—perhaps five minutes.Then happens the miracle of miracles, as sure as death, and yet as masterful aslife; a thing more miraculous, because so sudden, so apart from the usual courseof evolution. Natura non facit saltum—nature never makes a leap. True—thereforethis miracle is a thing as it were against nature. The melancholy vanishes; theeyes shine; the wan mouth smiles. Almost manly vigor returns, or seems toreturn. At least faith, hope, and love throng very eagerly to the dance; allthat was lost is found.The man is happy.2 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt521]image [images/9781620556313_062.jpg]Fig. 29.1. The “Cocaine” issue: The International, under Crowley’s editorshipOctober 1917A face-saving editorial note indicated Viereck’s demurral from some of Crowley’scolorful views but praised its detailed examination of the psychology associatedwith the drug. Crowley’s answer to the prohibitionist who argues that cocaine isthe drug of choice for criminals, giving them Dutch courage, he notes theargument insists that the drug progressively destroys the criminal’s ability tofunction successfully. On this basis, Crowley suggests free cocaine forcriminals in particular! He takes the view that the drug addict unable to dealwith the drug’s pitfalls was a familiar social type who would fail at everythingand a type hardly, in such condition, worth preserving. As things turned out,Crowley would himself have to face his own psychological addiction to the drug.In the early 1920s an obsession with the drug would cause considerable anguish,though he was able, in the end, to leave it behind, but the path to fullrealization of the uselessness of drugs, which came to him in 1924, was far fromstraightforward.Crowley had imbibed a kind of moral imperative from Darwinian-influencedthought, the one familiar to us as the “survival of the fittest.” He wrapped hisidea of the masters’ plan for humanity up in a combination of “spiritualevolution” and biological evolution, so adaption to extremes was regarded as abenefit to the species, on the principle of Jenner’s inoculation practice.Sufficient of the “bad” makes us better. There is some truth in this, scientificand moral, but there is a borderline. John Quinn observed when hearing FrankHarris’s justification for German militarism that civilization and its moralprogress is intended to ameliorate, at least, or better correct, the tendenciesof nature, including “survival of the fittest,” which may not be for us tojudge: because we may none of us be fit to do so. Would medicine have progressedif all sick people were abandoned completely at the sight of imperfection?Crowley himself was never slow in seeing a doctor, or recommending science. Inhis own dealings with people, he wavered on this point. The problem is simplythat Darwin’s interpretation of natural selection across species makes anatrocious basis for moral and spiritual teaching. Crowley attempted to abandondualism, and was convinced that he had. It was a symptom of the “zeitgeist,”which he believed he embodied.Pooling resources, Crowley and Roddie moved in together at a studio at 64a West9th Street, a couple of blocks from Washington Square, Greenwich Village, and alittle more than half a mile south of Madison Square Park, where there was now alife-size mock-up of a U.S. battleship, replete with guns, dominating thesquare, with registration and medical offices where young men queued up to playtheir patriotic part in the Allied struggle against Germany.Working in the pathological laboratory of a famous doctor, and afterward for acosmetic firm as chemist and pharmacist in Brooklyn, Roddie’s financialcontribution was probably the larger, but Crowley’s character and peculiarstatus brought her into some of the best parties of Greenwich Village’sburgeoning art set. Eccentric painter and interior designer, Robert WinthropChanler would invite the Beast to parties, as Crowley started trying his hand athis own occult-inspired paintings. If Engers or “Kennedy” could do auras,Crowley would go one, two, three better with an abrahadabra and a wave of thebrush, he would paint the forms of spirits themselves and get right inside thepsyche and dreamscape of individuals. He even experimented with automaticpainting, letting the unconscious move the brush, but he moved quickly on todefinite conceptions, strange galleries of a unique character’s bizarreworldview.image [images/9781620556313_063.jpg]Fig. 29.2. Roddie Minor Zimm, passport photoGreenwich Village also afforded opportunities for observing political radicalsin their element. Red Emma Goldman and Alex Berkman, both friends of socialistFrank Harris, were active in the village, affording Robert Nathan of BritishIntelligence an eye on I.W.W. and Bolshevist anarchists and troublemakers.Anyone wondering about Crowley’s political proclivities should have known he hada generously anarchic and socialistic (not socialist) brain, and an aristocrat’sheart, but above all, a commitment to wisdom, strength, and common sense. Howthis all might manifest could be seen in January 1918’s International, where ina lead article, “England Speaks,” Crowley confessed:For some curious reason, perhaps because I like to collect lunatics as GeorgeWindsor likes to collect postage stamps, I find myself regarded by superficialthinkers as a radical and revolutionary. I am in truth the most crusted ofTories, bred in the bone, and dyed in the wool. I believe, for example, that ifwe abandon the Catholic ideal of marriage, one may as well not have marriage atall. So, if we abandon the hierarchical system in religion or politics, onecannot stop short of anarchy, as soon as some occasion of stress forces peopleto make decisions. The Church of England had more dissenting movements in acentury than the Church of Rome in ten. It was a makeshift. So were theGirondins; so was Kerensky. Once leave the unintellectual, illogical, unjustanchorage of Wisdom, and you are tossed madly on the insane waves of Reason.3[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt522]This strikes one as evidence of the Latin apologist of Catholic truthTertullian’s well-known second-century paraphrase, “I believe because it isabsurd.” Knowing well the abyss of dialectics, Crowley would surely have agreed,and wondered why Tertullian in his battle with the Gnostics did not embrace theabsurd alternative!November saw Engers’s psychochrome exhibition in Manhattan, reviewed by Crowleyas “J. Turner” in December’s International under the title “Art andClairvoyance.” He opens with a succinct account of what may be seen when astraltraveling, seeing no reason why such visions should not be realized plastically.There has been no shortage of visions for the task, only of artists. Enter LeonEngers Kennedy.In the exhibition held last month by Mr. Engers Kennedy, we have a very definiteattempt to portray that which is seen by the spiritual sight, and the result maybe described as extremely successful because the artist is a good artist. Thesepictures can be looked at with pleasure from the purely aesthetic standpoint.There is no ad captandum effort to interest people in the subject of thepicture. They stand on their own merits as pictures. But it would be useless todeny that a supreme interest is superadded by the representation of thecharacter or mood of the sitter by the simple means of using the symbolic colorsand forms perceived by the spiritual eye as background. We need not go in detailinto the nature of the method employed. These pictures must be seen to beappreciated at their full value. But it is certainly possible to predict a greatvogue for these portraits. Everyone must naturally wish a representation inpermanent form of their inner as well as their outer body.4[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt523]It is clear from November’s issue that Crowley had at some point fallen out withEvangeline Adams, for there appeared his scathing essay “How Horoscopes AreFaked,”5 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt524] which establishes a sarcastic critiqueof Miss Adams’s abilities and business methods, without naming her. ObviouslyCrowley felt she had dealt with him poorly from the business standpoint, but wedo not really know what led them to fall out. The fact that he complained in hisConfessions she had inadequate scientific comprehension of the real universeshould have been obvious from shortly after they met. The fact she made moneyout of readings using inaccurate factors as a guise for greater precision wouldalso have been clear to him early on, so one must presume that theirdisagreement came over growing personality conflict, business or personalmatters, or a combination of the same. Crowley lost a great deal as a result,for when Miss Adams eventually produced abridged versions of his work, entirelyin her own name, in the 1930s, she did well out of it, but Crowley’s pride wouldhave kept him from coming up with a purely business solution. His article wasattributed to Cor Scorpionis—the heart of the Scorpion—and we may take it as hislast, dismissive sting on the subject.Thanks to William Breeze’s indefatigable efforts, that sting is not the lastword any more, for the complete study has been reconstituted, edited, andpublished under Crowley’s and Adams’s names, as it should have been a centuryago.*156 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft156]According to Crowley’s account—what a shame nobody interviewed Roddie Minor, wholived to be ninety-four!—Roddie had a masculine type of mental toughness but wasgiven to irrational bursts of white-hot feminine temper. Who would not havebeen, who possessed a strong mind of her own, in Crowley’s daily presence? Buthe didn’t call her the “Camel” for nothing. She was broad of back and up torugged living. He says he treated her as an equal, but she seemed increasinglywary of his dominating her, something he says he had no desire whatever to do. Acamel in the desert of course is the difference between life and death, soCrowley must have felt that he was still struggling.As indeed he was; on November 24 he dropped in at John Quinn’s office. FindingQuinn unavailable, Crowley entrusted Quinn’s secretary with his “Affidavit”concerning his “political attitude” since 1914. Clearly, Crowley felt hisongoing case for acceptance as an agent, rather than condemnation as a loosecannon, would be greatly assisted if one of the best lawyers in the land took uphis case, presumably with the Justice Department and the British consulate, withwhom Quinn had good relations.Having read the affidavit, Quinn wrote at once to Crowley’s West 9th Streetaddress.Dear Mr Crowley,Referring to your call at my office this morning at 10:30 when you were informedthat I was out, and to the note that you left, and to the statement in your notethat you wanted my advice on the “enclosed document,” which is on fourtypewritten pages and is entitled “Affidavit Memorandum of my PoliticalAttitudes since August 1914,” I have read the memorandum carefully.I regret that I have not the time to advise you in the matter. The subject ofyour relations to the war and the motives that have actuated you has apparently,to judge from the form of the affidavit, been the subject of letters from you toCaptain Gaunt, and of conversations with Mr. Kahn, and of a talk with Mr.Willert of Washington and of advice by Mr. Paul Bartlett. I have been sooverwhelmed with outside personal matters that I have had, in sheerself-defense, to decline to take on any more outside personal matters for theduration of the war and for three months beyond the duration of the war. Ialready have pending enough irrelevant outside personal matters to occupy all myspare time for the Winter.I have taken on a considerable number of these irrelevant matters because eachone seemed a small thing and it seemed foolish to refuse, and sometime it takesalmost as much energy to refuse or to explain a refusal as it does to do thething. But nearly all of these little things that looked innocent and short andsimple at first, drag on and on. Between those who want to get into the army andthose who want to get commissions and those who want to get positions, I couldopen a separate department in my law office. I am doing all I can as a citizenof this country. I cannot intervene in your case, being the subject of yourrelations to his Britannic Majesty and his laws and representatives. Thecontract is too large, the ocean is too wide, the problem too intricate, and, asI have said, I have not the spare time. If I could only shut out irrelevanciesand immaterialities, I would have more time to do things that I am vitallyinterested in. Many people who bring irrelevancies to me seem to go on thetheory of an old judge down in Maryland who, when a piece of evidence wasobjected to as “immaterial” used to always let it in with a remark that if it“was immaterial it wouldn’t hurt.” But, seriously speaking, I have no time toadvise on the matter.You will understand, I am sure.Yours very truly,John Quinn (Enclosure)6 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt525]If Quinn’s letter was a blow to Crowley, he never mentioned it, but got on withtrying to consolidate his future with The International. Not content to see anopportunity pass, Crowley made movements to get personal control of themagazine, realizing Viereck was considering detaching himself from it. Suchseems to have been the import of a letter Crowley wrote to Viereck on December1, 1917, when it appears that Crowley had found purchasers, or possiblepartners.My dear Viereck,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.My alkaline friends say:(1) Their money must not go into “enemy pockets.” (This means that you shouldtransfer your interest to a third party, and cease apparently all connectionswith the paper, before negotiations become formal. If any of the other holdersare conspicuously pro-German, they also would have to disappear, ostensibly.). ..(3) They are keen on “Humanity First” [the title of Crowley’s article in TheInternational 11, no. 11:332, advocating humanitarian considerations above allpugnacious nationalism], but there is something in their minds aboutElsass-Lothringen [Alsace-Lorraine; taken from France in 1871]. I cannot guesswhat it is. It does not seem to be a matter of sentiment. They will say no moreabout it until the deal is put through, but my editorship would apparentlydepend on my following their line in the matter. They assure me, however, thatthey would not insist on an anti-French policy.(4) They want a sort of high class monthly with weighty articles and essays.They like the fiction and poetry as it is, but do not want sex reform and birthcontrol or anything of that sort, nor do they want socialism or attacks onbusiness. They don’t mind anti-prohibition stuff and high-class occult stuff.. . . They also require some sort of declaration of loyalty from me personally.This would not be a vigilante’ declaration, but on Humanity First lines, with arider that I would say nothing which might interfere with the militarysituation. They are quite broad-minded about this, and would object to myadvocating revolution in Germany just as much as revolution here. . . .(6) They want the International character of the paper strongly held. This wouldinclude German authors, except those who have gone too far politically. Theywould equally bar Allied authors who screamed.Therefore, may I go 50-50 with you on anything I can get over $3000.00?Love is the law, love under will. Yours ever,Aleister CrowleyPS There are several flaws in the paper this month. . . . I have the “noble andeloquent article,” which is on [Lord] Lansdowne [“An Englishman Speaks”], andthe editorial which is on Austin Harrison as a Sinn Feiner, ready written.PPS I have two other groups to approach on the finance question. I hope to seeone next week. The others may be a little hard to reach.AC7 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt526]Sadly, the deal, whoever it may have been with, did not come off. The one thatdid, in 1918, was a woeful affair, as we shall see.On December 16, the Beast and the Camel performed one of a series of, mostlysuccessful, operations for “gold.” It was “very suksham”—Sanskrit for “subtle,”a word characteristic of their relations in the sexual field. Writing up resultson January 7, 1918, Crowley wondered whether a “new International deal” and anew series of “Simon Iff in America” stories would bring in the cash.8[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt527] Thoroughly concentrated over the festive periodwith Simon Iff, Camel and Beast let rip on Christmas Day for “Io, Pan Pan!” thedivine presence of the All that storms into life, ripping and rending andshocking and shaking.The New York Tribune’s Christmas Day headlines were considerably more sobering.KAISER DEFIANT ON EVE OF NEW OFFER OF PEACE—EMPEROR TELLS TROOPS GOD IS THEAVOWED ALLY OF GERMAN CAUSE.

In “A Glimpse into the Theatres,” hecommended ex-lover Helen Westley in no uncertain terms to his readers.†159[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft159]I have always liked the Washington Square Players, if only because Helen Westleyis the greatest passionate and tragic actress on the American stage. However,they cast her for parts which would be better filled by a far worse actress.They do not give her a fair show. She ought to be playing Lady Macbeth andTosca. The qualities of the plays in the first deal this year are notparticularly high. Blind Alleys contains an excellent idea, but it is too smallfor the length of the play; and it is further a mistake to hinge the catastropheof a play on psychics. In this as in the Thirteenth Chair the whole atmosphereis psychic. It is like the unwitting introduction of zero into an algebraicequation. You cannot satisfactorily introduce a hippopotamus as the deus exmachina of an Alaskan drama; it does not belong there.4[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt531]His Golden Rose poem “Dawn” is addressed, without rancor, to Hilarion, his lostwoman of scarlet.Sleep, with a last long kiss,Smiles tenderly and vanishes.Mine eyelids open to the gold,Hilarion’s hair in ripples rolled.(O gilded morning clouds of Greece!)Like the sun’s self amid the fleece,Her face glows.

Crowley had anindependent mind; in this sense he was quite right to call himself “Irish,” asit suited him.Had Crowley not been more devoted to Magick and his role as Magus of the “Wordof the Aeon,” which he firmly believed the masters were pressing on him, hecould have come to enjoy a career in America as star commentator and author,though he would have been hard pressed to keep his head above water during theProhibition era he warned was on God’s own country’s doorstep.But Magick was his business, and his experimentation in the field progressed inunique, mind-boggling fashion. During the first fortnight of 1918, Crowleyperformed sex-magick operations with Roddie, a colored man called Walter, and“Anna,” who might have been Roddie’s friend Anna Katherine Miller or someoneelse; the record is unclear. Sometimes, Crowley had magical sex with Walter;sometimes Roddie did. Then on Monday, January 14, Roddie had an experience thatchanged the character of the operations altogether.Sharing an opium pipe, Crowley was explaining to her very late in the eveninghow women had brought messages to him from the astral plane and how thesemessages needed to be tested rigorously, as deception was commonplace, and howthis testing was done. The point was that people have potential access toknowledge that ordinary consciousness cannot grasp, by logical reasoning orantecedent experience, but there is a realm beyond the limits of space and timethrough which, by power of imagination—a link to the “Pleroma” or fullness ofGod—the mind can enter to receive knowledge or, if careless, self-misleadingerrors.Suitably inspired, Roddie then had another vision of being thirteen womencaressed simultaneously. Impressed that Roddie was highly “turned on,” “tunedin,” and ready for magick, Crowley set to work on an astral “working” with her.For those who don’t know, the astrum, or star, is the name given in magic, asdefined by Éliphas Lévi, for the medium through which true will expressesitself, perceived as “material” but of a completely different quality fromnormal assumptions of matter. To enter the astral plane is to transferconsciousness to a medium of this nature, where ideas appear primarily as imagesor symbols indicated by identifiable “beings.” There seems to be a connection,or possibly more than that, between this magical conception and that ofpsychologist Carl Jung’s idea of the “unconscious” wherein, Jung surmised, existarchetypes (proto-forms), images, and symbols that encapsulate accreted wisdomabsorbed from thousands of years of conscious human experience.The astral traveler, in brief, imagines themselves as their own figure projectedbefore them, before willing a process of transference of consciousness from theEarth plane on which we live to this figure. Typically this figure may now riseas a conscious projection, conveying observation as, say, an astronaut radioingto base from outer space; though in this case, the implication is of a journeythrough “inner space.” Incidents within the protracted working that began onJanuary 14 offer the visual idea of participants rising through the ceiling upinto the night sky above Manhattan, then perhaps entering through a floor into acorridor with doors bearing symbols. Through such a door the astral body entersa scene.The first scene Roddie entered upon is worth recording as much for itspicturesque charm as anything else.AMALANTRAHShe saw a dark farmhouse amid trees and fields. To the sound of a stream’sgurgling water, a dark yoni appeared where a house stood. Such a suddentransposition is typical of astral vision. Crowley asks where the message willcome from; this she hears even though imaginatively she is “elsewhere.” Roddiesees armed soldiers lounging about, then an enthroned king resembling James T.Shotwell.*160 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft160] Roddie sees him not as an ordinaryking but as an archetypal “king of the world”; this would have appealed toCrowley, because the aim of Thelema was to initiate “kings”; that is,self-mastered beings. Having seen also an egg in which turned a fleshlikesubstance that “might become something,” Roddie asked the king’s name. The wordHam appeared between an egg and the soldiers. Crowley thought of Noah’s curse ofHam, the race derived from Ham’s son Canaan, and the three other “Hamitic” racesderived from Ham’s sons. There speaks Crowley the biblical scholar and Qabalist,but maybe it was simply Roddie’s word association: a prosaic “ham and eggs.”A wizard, old with a gray beard in a long black gown, infinitely wise, linkedhis arm with the king. Such a figure is a classic Jungian archetype of wisdom;Jung himself had envisioned such a one. The king and wizard went to a cave. WhenTherion advised Roddie to follow them, she found them playing with a revolver.Finding the wizard under a canopy at a mountainside, she introduced herself with“shyness and awe”: “I am Eve.” To communicate, the wizard indicated that shemust build a fire, which he demonstrated (this sounds like a Crowleyanexplanation of “energized enthusiasm”). The building, like a ritual, involvedthe idea of a baby. Then “a most beautiful lion was standing by the fire.”Smiling, the wizard said, “Child.” She saw a naked boy of five or six dancingplayfully in the woods. Therion asked what he would be like dressed. She saidclothes were ill-fitting and uncomfortable, which Crowley took to be the formulaof the “Old Aeon,” with the boy as “Horus,” king of the “new Aeon.” Roddiereckoned tiger skins would be appropriate dress for him. The old man put his armround Roddie’s shoulder and said, “It’s all in the egg.” That pricked Crowley’sattention, because an astral working of 1911 with Soror Virakam (Mary d’Este, orDesti Sturges) led to an encounter with wizard “Ab-ul Diz,” who indicated thatCrowley and his assistant needed to find an egg beneath a palm tree.5[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt532]According to Liber 729, The Amalantrah Working, at 3:00 a.m. on Sunday, January20, Roddie asked the wizard for a message. A large A appeared; an eagle flewthrough it and on through woods and close to the ground of meadows. When theeagle disappeared she saw “a red Indian was running like the wind”: “Verybeautiful as a picture.”At 4:00 p.m. Therion and Roddie entered the astral plane together. She wasdraped in a diaphanous yellow green gown, he in a brilliant gown with goldbraid, holding a scepter in one hand, a ring in the other. They went through theceiling about 900 feet into the air, where they looked up and saw an eye in theclouds. The eye was by a platformlike building in which were many doors bearingsigns, including the swastika. They approached a distant door at the end of acorridor where stood a dwarf on the right and a girl on the left. She asked thedwarf where the door led and saw a blazing column. Asking the girl, she receivedthe reply, “Heaven,” which Crowley took to mean where they wanted to go. Inanother corridor light came from a distant door. There were sheep just insidethis door, and on the ground below it spread out a “beautiful pastoral scene andsome villages.” A beautiful lady came when they dropped down to it, blond,dressed in white. Roddie asked her name: “Eve.” That seemed wrong. Where shouldthey go? “France.” The lady lay on the ground, her arms like fish fins, wavingtoward a village. A “Greek philosopher” appeared with a staff. Following thelady’s directions, they entered a village called “Pantruel.”*161[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft161] Pantruel had a church and a square fountain madeof metal with cones spewing water, and afterward, fire. The king of the previousweek’s vision appeared with papers, legal deeds and a topographical map of SouthAmerica. The king’s message was that they see the wizard, whom they found withthe child at a stream by the woods. “They both looked a little lonely.” Aftersome quizzing, and initially giving the name “Amalantre,” the wizard finallygave the spelling of his name: “Amalantrah.”†162 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft162]This was exciting to Crowley as it added to 729, the cube of 9, as did also theGreek Qabalah of the transliterated Aramaic kēphas, or “stone” (the name givento St. “Peter” in Matthew 16:18). Lévi gave 729 as the number of “the curse ofSatan” in relation to the bisexual “Baphomet” Lévi described in his Dogme etRituel de la Haute Magie (1855), reflected in the “Devil” tarot trump. Asked tosymbolize his name, Roddie saw a section of an octagonal column, which Crowleyrelated to the figure eight and a phallus. When Roddie asked who she was, thewizard said, “part of the Tao.” Once he said, “Go”; later he said, “Egypt.”*163[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft163]Crowley wasn’t going to miss the opportunity to find the true spelling of“Baphomet”—his title as O.T.O. British head, and the name given to an idol themedieval Templars allegedly worshipped. Crowley wished to equate the eight“siddhis” of the Magus to a supposed eight original letters of the name. InHebrew, Crowley’s interlocutor gave “BafomiTh” (with the Th a single lettertav): seven letters. Thinking to ask of the missing eighth letter, the HebrewReish flashed into Crowley’s mind, giving BafomiThR: which added to 729, anumber already related to an eightfold column and interpreted by Crowley as atransliteration of the Greek baphē meithra, or baptism of Mithra, the militantsun god, while the letter reish means the “head of a man,” as the idol ofBaphomet was said to be. The missing R then stood, in Crowley’s mind, for themissing solar, or phallic, principle in the darkness of the Old Aeon, the sunbeing the “father” or head of the universe whose creative analog on Earth is inCrowley’s system the phallus. Crowley believed it was given to him, the Magus,to restore the missing or obscured principle, to raise the phallic octagonal, or“fallen temple” of High Masonry, as he understood it.In Crowley’s associative thinking, all this was suggestive of the “concealedsun,” a symbol for midnight, insofar as to “see the light,” the spiritual light,is equivalent to seeing the sun at midnight, in the spiritual darkness of theworld. Crowley already associated the knowledge and conversation of the HolyGuardian Angel with the “dawning light,” or “augoeides,” the emergence of thatwhich was concealed. The symbolism here goes back to the Neoplatonist assessmentof the divine spirit’s relation to the “vehicle,” or person, on Earth.In Thomas Taylor’s Select Works of Porphyry (1823) regarding the “perception ofintelligible natures” according to third-century philosopher Porphyry’sinterpretation of Plato, when the body, at death, releases the rational soul, or“sense of ether,” it conjoins with the fire of pure ether, where a purgationoccurs, rendering the purified vehicle “augoeides,” or luciform and divine, fitto dwell in the “intelligible world.” On Earth, however, the rational soul,being infused with matter and its desires, is in a falling state, which state ismortal, a desertion of the divine state. The body is not fit for theintelligible world and must be fled from: such is Neoplatonic wisdom.Crowley was familiar with Blavatsky’s reading of the status of the divine spiritin man. She distinguished between the Neoplatonist position—where a luciformaugoeides is not entrapped but instead sheds its radiance on the aspiring innerman from outside the phenomenal universe, calling man forth to his intelligiblesource—and the belief of Christian Qabalists, akin to radical gnosis, that thespirit was catastrophically detached from the pleroma, imprisoned in the “astralcapsule” of earthly life, such being the meaning of the “fall of man.” Clearly,Crowley accepted the pagan Neoplatonist position, allowing access to the lightof the higher being through invocation or mystical theurgy.Having said “goodbye” to Amalantrah, Roddie and Therion bathed in the pool of aspring, sank through its bottom, and emerged “directly over Manhattan” and backinto their bodies. The record states that “much later” Roddie asked for theking’s name and was told “Eosonophon.” The etymology here is interesting.Eos was Greek goddess of dawn, a Titaness (Crowley had had a dream of Hilarionas a Titaness), sister of Selene (moon) and Helios (sun). Her son was calledEosphoros—that is, the “Morning Star” or dawn bringer. In Babylonian mythologythe morning star is the eightfold star, symbol of Ishtar, divine mother. Thedawn conception may then correspond to augoeides, luciform or luminous body,where the Greek eidos means “form” or “type” and augos means “morning light,”root of augere, the Latin verb “to increase”: hence Augustus the great, the nameOctavian gave to him-self and to the eighth month, when the sun is in the lion.“Eosonophon” then suggests the voice of dawn from phōnē, meaning “voice”; thatis, the “higher Genius,” or “daimon.” We are of course familiar with the SaxonEostre: goddess of dawn, origin of our word Easter, the raising of the light.It seems the genius of this vision shared Crowley’s peculiar sense of humor, forwhen asked the name of the boy, Roddie was given “Augustus Fioncharo.” August wenow recognize; fion is French for “arsehole,” while the name “Charo” is derivedfrom the Italian chiari, which means “bright” or “luminous”! We are in “Eye ofHoor” territory again. Incidentally, Crowley believed that Satan was originallysimply another word for the sun of our system—a Lucifer or light-bringer when atits greatest intensity, which state was eventually perceived as negative, onaccount of a conflict of solar priests, and the facts of Egyptian geography,where the “burning sun” in the south was called “Seth,” later identified withthe Greek Typhon, and considered a “Devil” of storms. This idea is consistentwith the first appearance of the “Satan” or “Adversary” in the biblical Job,where as prosecuting counsel, the Satan points the finger of perilous accusationat the accused, and one may think of the darts of the withering sun, directed atburning away defenses by light of truth.Astral interviewing of Amalantrah continued on Sunday, January 27. Roddie met atall Moor called Athanan in an oasis called Oseika near Marrakesh. From him shelearned her name in his language was Ahita, which had the value of 317; thisCrowley found resonated with the Hebrew for “olive” and Noah’s ark, and with hisown spelling of the Hebrew Chiva, as Achiha, for “Beast.” Roddie became“Achitha” or “Ahitha” for further communications.Crowley asked the wizard a series of down-to-earth questions about Therion’sformal relations with the Theosophical Society. He learned that Annie Besant wasnot close to death; that he ought to approach prominent TS member Carl HenrikBjerregaard (1845–1922), chief librarian at the Astor Library’s readingroom.*164 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft164] It was also recommended that hecontact someone called “Elsie Gray Parker,” allegedly a friend of Aimée Gouraud,living in a private house on or near Fifth Avenue. Crowley made assiduousefforts with spiritist Bert Reece to locate the “woman,” but she was neverfound, if she ever existed on the plane of Earth. Amalantrah also provedunreliable as to the “rich man of the west,” who would pour his gold on Crowleyaccording to The Book of the Law. The wizard said that he was an Austrian whowould turn up that year. If he did somewhere, Crowley missed him, but then,Crowley felt that he had made mistakes with his magick in 1918.Amalantrah was pumped for more information on February 3. They were to go toEgypt for the key, a small golden key, possibly to be found in the egg whenbroken. The name “Arctaeon” was important: someone who would preach the Law.Crowley applied it to C. S. Jones when Jones turned up at West 19th Street inMarch.What was the function of the Monkey Officer? “To operate through the abstractlaw of Obsession.” Was Roddie a Scarlet Woman? Yes. Were they working in theright way? No, they were not energetic or focused enough. Did Therion fall downon solve, or coagula? The latter. He should be sterner and more comprehensive.On February 7, a sexual rite with Walter and Anna aimed at physical strength;the Amalantrah Working was exhausting. Roddie complained through the wizard ofCrowley’s insensitivity to her feelings and real motives: “Later, as we talkalong, T[herion] attacks me again for having caressed him in the night. I haddone this in order to forget the differences of points of view that we seemed tohave. His remarks here take my breath away for he seemed to be so far fromunderstanding the whole underlying truth.”6 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt533] Thewizard laughed and said she ought not trouble Therion or she’d get her fingersburned; she needed not to care about his ways and moods.One of the curiosities of the astral workings was not only that the seer,without occult expertise, found means to convey Hebrew letters and symbols toCrowley but also how Roddie could grasp answers from Amalantrah even when thequestion was put by Therion as an acronym, namely, “IGMWF?”—“Shall I get my workfilmed?”—to which Amalantrah replied through Roddie, “Yes that is the way.”“Does Dorothy Troxel play any great part in the work in the near future?” “Yes.”“Has Faith Baldwin any part in the work?”*165 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft165]“No.” “Will Miss L be of use?”—probably Elsa Lincke, who joined the nextsession. “I see a moon, a full moon and an obelisk. Yes.” “A pretty blond womanin a beautiful blouse comes in to eat at the table. I can see her as a bride ofsome future date. I think of Jeanne Foster.”*166 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft166]Therion asked, “Will Ricker help?”†167 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft167]The February 11 working duly included Mrs. Elsa Lincke, whom Amalantrah calledBarzedon, whose symbol was the toad, and from whom much was to be learned.‡168[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft168]“Would the wizard be pleased to take B[arzedon] on the astral plane now?” “Yes.”Dorothy Troxel joined the operation on Sunday, February 24. “Give me the truemagical name of DT [Troxel]” “Wesrun.”§169 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft169] “Arethere any definite orders for the work?” This and Therion’s subsequent questionwere linked to a chain of events that may strike us as a unique case ofsynchronicity nearly a century later.ENTER SAMUEL AIWAZ JACOBSAhitha answered, “I see T[herion] in his office, also with a flower in his coat.He is rather happy. He is at his desk. There are many letters. One to DT[roxel].I also see two books which were mailed. . . . 9:30 p.m. T[herion] asks forA[malantrah] to spell Therion which he does. image [images/img_006.jpg][ThiriAan].”8 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt535] The gematria of Amalantrah’sspelling meant nothing to Crowley. Shortly, Crowley lost his temper and allcommunications ceased. The working resumed later, but it proved useless.On the Monday morning, Crowley went to his office at 1123 Broadway to check overhis mail. A coal famine prompted an order that offices should not be heated onMondays, so a chilled Crowley left early. The next day he returned to find aletter picked up the previous day by Viereck and then left for Crowley to dealwith. The letter, which answered Crowley’s question put to Amalantrah on theSunday, must have been posted about the same time the question was put to thediscarnate wizard.BETH NAHARIN (MESOPOTAMIA)2-24-18Nahon Elias PalakEditor and Publisher210 Getty AvenuePatterson, New JerseyGeorge Sylvester Viereck Esq.EditorThe International1123 BroadwayNew York CityMy dear Bokh.

The masters hadarranged a sign so incalculably vast as to its odds that he could but accept itgracefully and investigate further. Crowley contacted the stranger Jacobs atBridgeport, Connecticut, and asked him whether he had the gematria of Aiwass,the dictator of The Book of the Law, which Crowley had always taken to be 78from “Mezla,” the influence of Chokmah (AYVAS). Jacobs, a man who would latersay that his middle name meant Satan (!), gave Crowley the gematria of OYVZ,which added to 93, the number of the Greek Thelema (Will) and Agape (love).*170[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft170]I was always intrigued by the detail about Crowley’s coming in to 1123 Broadwayto look over mail only to leave on account of the freezing office, so I thoughtI’d consult the well-respected oracle of truth, the Sun newspaper of Monday,February 25, to connect back to what we take as the real world.Things were freezing all right. The main headline read 146 BELIEVED LOST INWRECK OF NY BOUND LINER NEAR CAPE RACE. The photograph showed the “SteamshipFlorizel as She Appeared Recently When Breaking Ice in New York Harbour.” Thesubheading read, “Florizel Strikes Reef During Blinding Snowstorm—All AboardRegarded as Having Perished.”Meanwhile in Ireland: “CRISIS AT HAND ON HOME RULE EVEN if Irish Constitution IsOffered Its Acceptance Carries Dangers.” “ARMY CAPTAIN, GERMAN AGENT, GETS 25YEARS—Court-martialled Here After Being Brought Back from France.”Then there were the announcements of shortages on account of war rationing. Acaption at the bottom of the front page read, “This is a Wheatless Day,” next to“Strikes and Revolution Predicted in Germany.” Turn to page 2 to find out aboutthe coal shortages that sent Crowley back home that day: “WILL ALLOT COAL SUPPLYBY APRIL—The first conclusive action of the Fuel Administration in apportioningthe nation’s coal among householders and industries for the coming year will betaken next Friday.” Navy and transport needs were paramount.Meanwhile, with all of Amalantrah’s recommendations that Crowley head to Egyptto find the egg, it’s interesting to note the ubiquity of Egyptiandeities—especially those you could smoke. A large advertisement invited readersto partake of “Egyptian Deities—The Utmost in Cigarettes—Plain end or Cork Tip.People of culture and refinement invariably PREFER Deities to any othercigarette. Twenty-five cents.”RATIONING BEGINS IN BRITAIN TODAY. On page 3, a headline indicated thatCrowley’s clandestine interest in the I.W.W. was not without foundation.“LETTERS LINK BERKMAN WITH GERMAN SPIES—Emma Goldman Also in Plot of Har Dyal toFoment India Revolution.” “WASHINGTON 24 February—Startling evidence believed bythe Department of Justice to be the thread which will lead to unraveling acomplicated connection of Alexander Berkman, Emma Goldman, and other leaders ofthe I.W.W. and kindred organizations in the US with the German spy system inother countries, was made public here today. Two letters written to Berkman byHar Dayal, the founder of the Hindu revolutionary paper Chadr in San Franciscowere seized by the Dept. of Justice at the time the offices of the publicationMother Earth were raided. . . . Dayal is now in Berlin and has been there since1914 working in close connection with the German Foreign Office in trying toorganize a Hindu revolution. . . .” The first of the letters containing theevidence against the two anarchists was addressed to Berkman “In care of MotherEarth office, West 125th street, near Sixth Ave NY” and was postmarked“Amsterdam, October 24, 1915.” Correspondents referred to one another as“Comrades.”In German American brewing capital, Milwaukee: “MILWAUKEE PUPILS DROPPINGGERMAN—The language of the Kaiser and ‘kultur’ has lost its popularity in thegrammar schools of Milwaukie. . . .”On a lighter note, the wonderful Ethel Barrymore was appearing in “The Smartestand Best Acted Comedy of the Year,” The Off Chance, at the Empire, next to TheCohan Revue 1918, and the Zieg feld New Midnight Frolics atop the New AmsterdamTheater. An advert for “BEVO,” a beverage, made the most of the extreme weather,showing ice around a sign reading “Cold Weather Notice”: “Keep in mind that Bevo. . . will freeze at 32° Fahrenheit—just like any other non-alcoholic beverage.If Bevo were merely a summer beverage this warning might not be so timely.”On page 6: “Shop Early for Coal and Build New Bins. Some of the gentlemen thatpreside over the coal supply are seriously pondering the advisability of urginghouseholders to fill their bins this summer against the chill of next winter.”On page 8: “CLASSES IWW AS BOLSHEVIKI—Ralph M. Easley, chairman of NationalCivic Federation, attacks the IWW as the counterpart of Bolsheviki in Russia.”The Tribune also announced WHEATLESS DAY—ONE MEAL WITHOUT WHEAT. Germany’s PeaceTerms were accepted by Russia, with Germany getting half the Ukraine, Livonia,Esthonia, half of Poland and so forth. This was “The Great War—1305th Day. [U.S.Field Marshall] Pershing’s Men Assuming More Important Role.” On page 14: “U.S.Is Urged to Seize Records of German-American Alliance—Philadelphia Branch ofGerman Alliance Denies Disloyalty Charge. Bill to Intern All Enemy Aliens IsUrged on Congress.”And the weather report: yesterday highest temperature 52°, lowest 31°. At 6:00a.m.That’s the news, folks! Now who was Samuel Aiwaz Jacobs?image [images/9781620556313_065.jpg]Fig. 30.1. Samuel Aiwaz Jacobs (ca. 1891–1971)Shmuel bar Aiwaz bie Yackou de Sherabad (ca. 1891–1971) was as striking apersonage as his name suggests. His New York Times obituary tells us that he“was born in Persia, came to the United States as a youth, and in 1909 became aprinter for the Persian Courier, a weekly here. Later he worked for theMergenthaler Linotype Company, designing and revising unusual type faces. In theearly 1930s he founded the Golden Eagle Press.”9 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt536]His origins appear vague. The 14th U.S. Census of 1920 shows a “Samual Jacobe,”aged twenty-nine, who migrated to the States in the 1900s from Persia. Describedas an “Assyrian,” Jacobs wrote a book, Information for Assyrians Desiring toBecome American Citizens, of which only one copy survives in the Library ofCongress. He became a naturalized American in 1917 and then worked as a“linotyper.”10 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt537]The name “Assyrian” is given to an Aramaic-speaking people indigenous tonorthern Iraq, geographically close to the biblical “Naharin,” home of Abraham’sfamily in Genesis. The Kurdish government calls Assyrians “Kurdish Christians”;they are frequently ill-treated. Many of them live in close proximity to theYezidis, who were first persecuted by Ottoman rulers and now by extremistMuslims. The designation Assyrian also refers to any member of the AssyrianChurch of the East, the oldest Christian church in Mesopotamia, founded byThomas the Apostle; members survive in present-day Persia.The Assyrian Church, like the “Chaldaean” Roman Catholic– affiliated Church,used Estrangelo, a Syriac font. According to William Breeze, Jacobs used SyriacEstrangelo to give the Hebrew values for the word Thērion.11[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt538] The name “Aiwaz” is not of Syriac origin. Samuelbar Aiwaz wrote that he was of the “house of Yackou”—Jacob—of Sherabad.Curiously, in an illustrated 1929 U.S. interview article, Samuel Jacobsasserted, with a gleeful eye, that his middle name, Aiwaz, meant “Satan.”Philosophical eclecticism seems to have been part of the Jacobs heritage.Perhaps Samuel the fine printer recognized something of himself in Crowley, thelover of fine and obscure editions. Crowley refers to him as a “Brother.” Thereis no record of his being a member of either the O.T.O. or the Aimage[images/dots.jpg]Aimage [images/dots.jpg]; perhaps he was a Freemason. Crowleyintuited a more pro-found relationship between them, a spiritual bond. Suchkinship is evident in a fascinating interview with Jacobs that appeared in theOctober 1953 edition of the Inland Printer.12 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt539]In a series on America’s private presses, P. J. Thomajan visited the GoldenEagle Press at Mount Vernon, New York, to meet “that Persian printer-philosopherSamuel Aiwaz Jacobs.” Jacobs’s press was famous for its editions of the works ofE. E. Cummings. Thomajan described Jacobs as “a rare blend of mystic andrealist, one blessed with a creative eye and hand, who finds interesting ways offulfilling his visions. There is intuitive logic to his approach that results ininspired originalities.”“Jacobs,” writes Thomajan, “is paced to the modern tempo but he has nothing butdisdain for the word modernistic.” Jacobs explained how “art springs not fromrules and regulations but from feeling. If there is no feeling, logic is a blindalley and reason a dead end. Logic is a poor guide without the light of feeling.. . . Follow no one. Only yourself can lead you. . . . Approach your line ofactivity as an individual. . . . Be independent.”Little wonder Crowley was struck by Jacobs’s manifestation in his life; he hadfound, or been found by, a fellow spirit—a son of Aiwaz, no less!Thomajan reported how Jacobs felt the “closest affinity” to a work “by a fellowPersian,” The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayam, which he designed. But it was a precepttaken from the Persian philosopher Zarathushtra that, according to Thomajan,“gives poise and persistence to this artist-craftsman. . . . Unto thepersevering mortals the ever-present guardian angels are swift to assist.”Ever-present guardian angels! Swift to assist! Crowley knew the quotation. Hehad read it in William Wynn Westcott’s edition of the Chaldaean Oracles! Thewisdom of Zarathushtra encapsulates the largely unknown relations of SamuelAiwaz Jacobs and Aleister Crowley.The plot thickens. Crowley, most curiously, was never sure whether Jacobs mightnot have been, in some sense, Aiwass, his Holy Guardian Angel. The encounterwith Jacobs’s mind seems to have set his own mind wandering into a number ofunanticipated places.I now incline to believe that Aiwass is not only the God or Demon or Devil onceheld holy in Sumer, and mine own Guardian Angel, but also a man as I am, insofaras He uses a human body to make His magical link with Mankind, whom He loves,and that He is thus an Ipsissimus, the Head of the Aimage[images/dots.jpg]Aimage [images/dots.jpg]13 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt540]As late as 1945, a question from Gerald Yorke about Aiwaz elicited the followingquite extraordinary response.Surely Eq[uinox] of [the] Gods [Book 4, Part IV] covers your query re Aiwaz asfully as possible. The only part undetermined is whether He is a discarnateBeing, or (as seemed possible after the Samuel Jacobs incident—Magick pp. 256seq. Footnote 2 [original pagination]) a human being, presumably Assyrian, ofthat name. And that I simply do not know, and cannot reasonably surmise, becauseI do not know the limits of such an One.14 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt541]The implications fair boggle the mind, which is precisely what we should expectfrom a Magus, and why something in us wants to take notice."},{"pageContent":"THIRTY-ONEimage [images/9781620556313_099.jpg]Unholy Holiness at 64a West Ninth StreetThe same day Crowley received the letter from Jacobs, he sat bolt uprightthrough the freezing cold of the night until 5:30 a.m. writing what would becomeLiber Aleph, The Book of Wisdom and Folly. A concise book of Thelemic Wisdom, itwas written for his “Son,” Charles Stansfeld Jones, though one suspects the“son” felt he could have done without it. Crowley said it was for love of hisson that he wrote it, but it is difficult to understand why he put himselfthrough so much physical and mental hardship to complete a work that was noteven published in his lifetime.*171 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft171]Liber Aleph is written in epistolary fashion in the style of the sacred magic ofAbra-Melin given by “Abraham the Jew to his son Lamech,” or of HermesTrismegistus’s wisdom given to his “son” Asclepius. By son, the hierophantsmeant closest disciple, and Crowley felt the necessity of keeping Jones close.Crowley clearly wanted to write an initiated text to stand alongside theclassics of magical wisdom. That, presumably, is why he chose to employ thetremendous discipline of an archaic, hieratic style, archaic even forseventeenth-century England, to which period its tenor is closest, a style hemaintained with tremendous discipline throughout its 208 chapters. Each chapter,given a Latin heading, takes precisely one page to compress its message ofwisdom. Anyone who thinks for a second that Crowley was not extremely seriousabout his Magick, or that he stinted on occult scholarship, should consult thiswork. Timeless in its archaisms, its message is modern. The following is chapter64, De Ratione Magi Vitae (“On Reason in the Life of the Magician”).Study thou Logic, which is the Code of the Laws of Thought. Study the Method ofScience, which is the Application of Logic to the Facts of the Universe. Thinknot that thou canst ever abrogate these Laws, for though they be Limitations,they are the Rules of thy Game which thou dost play. For in thy Trances thoughthou becomest That which is not subject to those Laws, they are still final inrespect of Those things which thou hast set them to govern. Nay, o my Son, thisWord govern, liketh me not, for a Law is but a Statement of the Nature of theThing to which it applieth. For nothing is compelled save only by Virtue of itsown True Will. So therefore human Law is a statement of the Will and of theNature of Man, or else it is a falsity contrary thereunto, and becometh null andof none effect.Chapter 84 attempts to explain to Jones what he was doing with the Scarlet Womanin workings such as the present one with Amalantrah. Crowley “did create anImage of my Little Universe in the mind of the Woman of Scarlet; that is, Imanifested mine whole Magical Self in her Mind. Thus then in Her, as in aMirror, have I been able to interpret myself to myself.” The medium locates themessage. He then makes the point that such methods require constant alertness.Persons encountered in the magical mind must be tested by the “Holy Qabalah andby the True Signs of Brotherhood.” Each person encountered “shall be part of ThySelf, made individual and perfect, able to instruct thee in thy Path.” ForCrowley, whether or not “Amalantrah” enjoyed objective being was purelysemantic, the nature of the Working assured its reality, the microcosm beingonly the macrocosm in small; that is, as made accessible to the “vehicle.” AsHamlet put it: “There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than aredreamt of in your philosophy.” Crowley did not hesitate to use the powers towhich initiation had granted ingress.In March, still composing Liber Aleph, Crowley decided to put his skillssquarely into an exercise of “goetic magick.” Goetic magick is magic involvingcommand of “demons,” for goetia derives from the Greek for “sorcery.”Traditionally, in magic, King Solomon had control of demons, and importantly, hehad the wisdom to keep them to their lowly place, as servants of lesseroperations in the cosmic hierarchy. A demon uncontrolled is like permitting adelinquent hired to clean a car access to an arsenal of loaded weapons. That iswhat hierarchies are for: that beings may exercise the gifts over which theyhave responsible care, which is why democracy needs severe checks and balances,lest the mob rule and the structure of wisdom fall, as has occurred repeatedlywith attendant, lasting misery.On March 9, at 10:40 p.m., Crowley began a sex-magick operation with Roddie tosecure the “Earned Success” that a tarot reading of the “six of discs” suggestedas a current possibility. They had taken Anhalonium lewinii (peyote), considereda “mercurial drug,” but it proved a “complete failure.” Rising to the astral,Crowley asked Amalantrah if the wizard approved his evoking Belial, as demon ofHod (the sephira of “splendor,” consistent with wealth). In Crowley’s book ofcorrespondences, 777, Hod, is associated most strongly with Hermes, Thoth, andMercury, and to the four eights of the tarot.According to a seventeenth-century grimoire, the Lesser Key of Solomon, familiarto Golden Dawn students, each zodiacal sign had three decans of ten degrees each(because there are twelve zodiacal signs and 360 degrees for the sun to “passthrough” in its annual “cycle”). Each decan had two demons corresponding to it,one for day and one for night. Because the operation with Roddie was undertakenwhen the sun was in Aquarius, the relevant demons were Belial, night demon forthe second decan, and Asmodee for the day.The first part of the operation went well from Crowley’s point of view. Crowleyand Roddie were conjoined per vas nefandum (“by the abominable vessel” = analsex), the rite “most demoniacally orgiastic.”1 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt542]Crowley noted that “this is a dangerous type of Work, because of Sacrament.” The“sacrament” was the mixed sexual fluids that formed the basis of materializationof the demonic spirits. He seems to have been implying that loss of control ofthe sacrament could lead to loss of control of the demonic spirit, which mightthen wreak havoc physically or psychologically.What they were doing with themselves becomes a little clearer in the Liber 729Amalantrah Working record for Sunday, March 10. “Any desired Tarot Card can beinvoked in this IX° way by begetting its hierarchy, and giving them our ownbodies to manifest through, by feeling the Eucharist. So then we turn our ownselves into talismans of Earned Success or the like. Names of Goetic demons canbe used.” Presumably the demons’ use of the magicians’ bodies lasted only solong as the sacrament was active, though this point is not clear and would seemto be where the “danger” lay: the possibility of obsession. Crowley may havebeen clear about his control of evoked forces, but what of Roddie?By 12:20 a.m. on the Sunday morning, Roddie was rolling about in agony. AsCrowley charitably put it, “The God Mercury being too pure for her corrupt mindand body.” The mescaline proving a dud, they had taken opium (the mercurialagent). The couple got to sleep eventually. Both felt refreshed and normal at9:00 a.m. Because it was now day, they would have to “beget” Asmodee. “He hasthree heads: bull, man, ram; snake’s tail, goose’s feet, rides with banner andlance on a dragon.”2 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt543] Back on the astral plane at2:35 p.m., Therion asked Amalantrah through Achita why opium didn’t suit her.Envisioning a duck’s head with a large beak, Achita (Roddie) assumed she’d takentoo much. Therion asked, “Is this all rational?” To which Roddie replied, “Yes!729 [Amalantrah] says that I must take HH [hash] drop by drop this pm.”3[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt544]It would be Thursday, March 14, before they evoked Asmodee in themselves in arite of “demoniacal ecstasy.” The session was followed by further discourse withAmalantrah, who was asked whether “Marie” was a friend to him and his work. Theanswer was ambiguous: the image of Pan’s reed, also the sign of Jupiter, whichmight suggest ransom, vengeance, pollution, revelation, and the angel of sevencups, with its suggestion of debauchery or dangerous pleasures.The “Marie” in question was five feet six, gray-eyed, dark-brown-haired MarieRöhling (1891–1969), part of Greenwich Village’s left-wing scene, a lady of faircomplexion, sincere conviction, and conceivably a source of intelligence forCrowley. An immigrant from Odessa, born Maria Eliasberg, or Elsburg, she becamea U.S. citizen in 1913, marrying Herman Röhling of Chicago.*172[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft172] When Crowley met her, she was givingenthusiastic lectures under the name Marie or Maria Lavroff on change in Russia,having addressed representatives of 125 women’s organizations at a meeting ofthe League of Cook Country Clubs in Chicago on May 23, 1917. “The Russians havebeen forty years starting a real revolution, but when it came it was good,” shedeclared.4 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt545] She had no idea what was coming.Everyone took a day off from magick on Saturday, March 16, when Saint Patrick’sDay celebrations spurred more than three thousand Irish American women to marchin fulsome bright smocks through New York’s streets bearing aloft the flags ofthe “Entente powers,” as the Tribune described them, including that of GreatBritain. One suspects Crowley would have joined the throng to catch theauthentic atmosphere of ex-pat Celtic fervor as the Tribune’s front pageannounced: “Kaiser’s Three Allies Seek Parley; Russia Ratifies Peace; Japan toAct.” Lower on page 1, more news of the socialist-anarchist InternationalWorkers of the World: “US Troops to Quell I.W.W. Riots.” It was reported in SanFrancisco on March 15 that troops were dispatched to Saint Mary’s, Idaho, whererioting between citizens and the I.W.W. had broken out. A two-hundred-strongcrowd tried to extract I.W.W. man “Nelson” out of jail. Refusing them entry, thesherriff suffered a beating.German General Ludendorff, meanwhile, gloated that now the Treaty ofBrest-Litovsk had taken Russia out of the war, the “Teutons [were] now strongerthan their Foes,” the byline adding, somewhat implausibly, that “Russia hasbecome big German Farm,” while in Britain, “Peace Talk Sapping the Morale of theNation Says Lloyd George”; and in France, “Paris Theatres Close to Reduce AirRaid Peril.” It was amid the dark horror of these raids that distressed Frenchcomposer Claude Debussy died at the age of fifty-five on March 25.Charles Stansfeld Jones entered proceedings at West 9th Street on Sunday, March17, having sold all his possessions in Canada to join his magical “father” inNew York. Marie Lavroff (or Lavrova) was also in the temple. One of Jones’sfirst acts was to participate in an ether experiment. Experiencing anaccelerated temporal sense, Jones reached a point where he could understandAchita’s being afraid of it. Crowley advised that it was the Ego that put thebarrier up, it being unhappy at having it demolished at its expense. Typically,Crowley said that enjoyment would only come after experiencing the full strengthof a thing. He also said the dangerous area in drug taking was reaching a pointwhere one couldn’t tell whether the drug was friend or foe. Other insightsoccurred to the ether-heads, such as fear of death was simply fear of loss ofconsciousness; one opened one’s eyes on ether to see if one was still conscious.Sight was necessary to be sure one was conscious. Change of consciousness was achange in the rapidity of vibration. There was a distinction betweenunconsciousness and subconsciousness.Welcome to West 9th Street, Brother Jones!—or rather, Arctaeon, by which name hewould soon be known for the remainder of the Amalantrah Working.After a few days of Marie being around, Roddie became jealous. Crowley haddubbed Mrs. Röhling “Olun,” which in Hebrew added to 156, the number of theScarlet Woman. Roddie feared loss of territory. To put matters right, a magicaloperation was undertaken at midnight on March 22 whose Object was “Liberty” toall: for Crowley “to take vampires fearlessly”; for Olun, to destroy the “sincomplex”; and for Achitha, to transcend her jealousy.5[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt546]The title of chapter 109 of Liber Aleph suggests that Crowley did take vampireOlun fearlessly: “On his Woman Olun, and on the Ecstasy that Surpasses All.”“My Son, I am enflamed with Love. . . . It is Nuit herself invisibly thatembraceth me, and enkindleth my Soul in Ecstasy. But this last Passion, that myLady Olun hath brought unto me upon this last Day of the Winter of theThirteenth Year of the Aeon, even as I wrote these Words unto thee, is a Mysteryof Mysteries beyond all these. O my Son, thou knowest well the Perils and theProfit of our Path; continue thou therein. Olun!”It was of course a feature of red revolutionary fervor in its first, heady, andmost illusory dawn to believe sexual repression would go the way of capitalistexploitation amid the converging joys of communism, so we may presume that Mariefelt she was giving her all for the promised parousia of the workers’ state. OnMarch 24, Olun gave the Beast a magical hand job for “Sowing the seed of theLaw.”As John Lennon once wrote, parodying the parable of the Sower, “Some fell on thestony ground, and some fell on the waistcoat.”MEETING LEAH HIRSIGCrowley’s Confessions describes his first meeting with the woman who, famously,would in due course come to assume Scarlet Woman status for more than fiveyears. Leah Hirsig (1883–1975)—one of eight siblings of a Swiss German motherwho had quit Switzerland for the States to avoid a drunken husband—firstappeared in Crowley’s life in the spring of 1918 accompanying her much oldersister, Marie (or Marianne) Magdelena Hirsig. According to Marianne’s account(written under her married name, Marian Dockerill), Crowley’s studio happeningshad led to a stream of intrigued persons wishing to meet the latest luminary ofGreenwich Village bohemian life. Crowley’s account is that on the eveningconcerned he could not let the sisters into the studio as he was “in animportant conference with an antique, but sprightly German lady.”6[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt547] This was Elsa Lincke, and we may be right inthinking the date was Tuesday, March 26, for in the Amalantrah record, SororBazedon began an astral journey in search of Amalantrah at 5:15 p.m. that day.She met a being called “Amalaftan,” who would guide her to the wizard.Leaving Elsa in his studio, Crowley was struck by Leah’s slim, boyish figure,wedgelike face, poignant sadness, and “sublime simplicity”: a romanticwhitewash. He began to kiss her. She responded warmly, their kissing onlyinterrupted by occasional breaks to answer the older sister’s questions. What,one wonders, could such questions have been.Marian Dockerill’s own account was very different. It first appeared serializedin the New York Journal on March 13, 1926, and then as a popular booklet oncheap paper, as My Life in a Love Cult, A Warning to Young Girls, My True LifeStory by Marian Dockerill, High Priestess of Oom, price fifty cents (1928). Thebulk of the booklet dwelled on Marian’s initiation into the ways of love andeventually into more formal initiation into a tantric society run by freelancereligious philosopher Pierre Arnold Bernard (1875–1955), known popularly as the“Omnipotent Oom,” who started with a clinic in San Francisco for yoga andhypnosis and moved on to attract young women to self-realization through tantra,while enjoying the path to his own ends, and acquiring a reputation as a scholarof Eastern religion.Marian’s treatment of Crowley is as a type that young women should especiallyavoid. She says the first occasion she met the “evil” Crowley, the “Antichrist,”worshipper of “Satan,” she had obtained an introduction to his studio inGreenwich Village from a clairvoyant lover of hers. Other women were presentwhen the sisters arrived.Arms folded, eyebrows pinched, Crowley fastens his eyes on her virgin ingenuesister. Leah refuses to leave with her elder sister, spending the night beingjoyously violated by the older letch, her personality transformed by morninginto that of Crowley’s very willing sex slave and lapdog.7[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt548] By the time the story came out, Crowley’sreputation had already been ruined by “sinister revelations” not only in theSunday Express and John Bull papers in the United Kingdom but also ininnumerable U.S. papers picking up on alleged scandals connected with Crowley’sbusiness in Detroit in 1919 and other salacious exposés, invented by imaginativejournalists catering for cheap thrills. One more was grist to the mill.image [images/9781620556313_066.jpg]Fig. 31.1. My Life in a Love Cult, A Warning to Young Girls, My True Life Storyby Marian Dockerill, High Priestess of Oom, 1928In fact, not only did Marian Dockerill get the place where Leah first metCrowley wrong (Washington Square rather than West 9th Street), she did notmention her having met Crowley before. Through psychic investigator HerewardCarrington, Crowley had been invited to lecture under the auspices of fraudulentpsychic demonstrator Christian P. Christiansen. It turned out that Leah’s oldersister, Marianne (later Marian Dockerill), who was in the audience, wasCarrington’s “intimate friend,”8 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt549] which Crowleylearned after the lecture when they talked. According to Crowley, he chattedwith her on two or three occasions afterward, meeting by chance. By the timeMarianne’s, or rather, Marian Dockerill’s, doom-laden account was published, hersister Leah’s time with Crowley had ended with her returning to a Bronx teachingpost; Leah’s devotion to the Beast, and his to the ex–Scarlet Woman, along-spent force.Interviews with Amalantrah continued into April, the questions increasinglybanal. It might have seemed that it was not possible to go shopping withoutAmalantrah’s auguries for success or failure. Reading the record, one gets thefeeling that Roddie in particular was getting bored and irritated with theexercise.Then, Crowley struck another reef. On April 9, he dispatched a standard letterto everyone concerned with the International.Dear Sir,I am just writing this note to announce that Dr. L. M. Keasbey is now proprietorand editor of the International and I am sure he will maintain the high standingto which you have become accustomed. . . .9 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt550]Lindley M. Keasbey, the man who had let Crowley down over the proposed O.T.O.lodge in Texas, the radical who had lost his academic chair for his left-wingantiwar stance, the man who had left Crowley languishing in New Orleans, hadcome to manifest in this world as editor and proprietor of a literary magazine.Crowley’s assurances of the International’s continued high standing were asworthless as Keasbey’s that Crowley could go on contributing. In fact, Keasbeywould accept nothing from Crowley and, disregarding all advice, wrecked themagazine after one issue. This gave Crowley much pleasure to reflect on in lateryears. He might better have wept at the loss of the only conventional job heever had. The last April issue of the International was a particularly good one,with interesting contributions from a wide selection of writers. It could havegone places, and the Beast with it.On April 17, Gerda von Kothek turned up for a rare “orgiastic” operation withthe Beast dedicated to spreading the Law. Three days later, Crowley had a laststab at getting from Amalantrah the meaning of the “making the lion very deadindeed” dream, now more than three years past, yet still unexplained. Havingtaken 1cc of hashish with Jones, Roddie obtained from the wizard a vision of theHebrew letter Reish crowned with flowers. This was supposed to mean that theElixir must “die in the cucurbite.”10 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt551] Crowleythought of John’s Gospel (12:24): “Except a corn of wheat fall into the groundand die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.” Crowleystill couldn’t grasp the idea, which to me at least, sounds akin to earlySimonian Gnostic practices, as reported in book VI of Church Father Hippolytus’sRefutation of All Heresies.11 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt552] In these there ismuch emphasis on the tree that is consumed by fire. The idea of fieryconsummation would fit well with what followed from Amalantrah. When Therionasked, “What shall we do to improve our technique in charging talismans?” Theresponse was the image of a burning tree. Following is Hippolytus reporting,without realizing it, on Gnostic sex practices in the second century CE(Refutatio VI, 4).[T]he super-celestial [fire], is a treasure, as it were a large tree, just sucha one as in a dream was seen by Nebuchadnezzar, out of which all flesh isnourished. And the manifest portion of the fire he regards as the stem, thebranches, the leaves, [and] the external rind which overlaps them. All these[appendages], he says, of the Great Tree being kindled, are made to disappear byreason of the blaze of the all-devouring fire. The fruit, however, of the tree,when it is fully grown, and has received its own form, is deposited in agranary, not (flung) into the fire. For, he says, the fruit has been producedfor the purpose of being laid in the storehouse, whereas the chaff that it maybe delivered over to the fire. [Now the chaff] is stem, [and is] generated notfor its own sake, but for that of the fruit.Behind the visible creation is a hidden, secret fire, protean or indefinite—inthe sense also of undefined, limitless, and undefinable. Gnostics claimingderivation from Jesus’s contemporary, Simon Magus, likened the fire to a tree.When the body or rind is burned away by its all-devouring fire, what remains isthe fruit of spirit, the fire invisible to the uninitiated.The lusts of the flesh are consumed by the fire in the supreme rite, revealingthe essence of the Great Tree wherein God speaks to the holy (the burning bushof Moses, according to Simon). That an actual spiritual-sexual rite is beingalluded to by allegorical means becomes clearer when we read what Hippolytusnext has to say about Simon’s justification, a quotation from scripture.And this, he [Simon] says, is what has been written in Scripture: “For thevineyard of the Lord of Sabaoth is the house of Israel, and the man of Judah isHis beloved plant.” [Isaiah 5:7 paraphrase] . . . it has been proved, he says,that there is not any other tree but that man. But concerning the secretion anddissolution of this [tree], Scripture, he says, has spoken sufficiently. And asregards instruction for those who have been fashioned after the image [of him],that statement is enough which is made [in Scripture], that “all flesh is grass,and all the glory of flesh, as it were, a flower of grass. The grass withereth,and its flower falleth; but the word of the Lord abideth forever.” The word ofthe Lord, he says, is that word which is produced in the mouth, and a Logos, butnowhere else exists there a place of generation. (Refutatio VI, 5)The last cryptic sentence of the quotation above refers, we can be fairly sure,to the vagina of the priestess, understood as the mystic yoni: the place ofgeneration where the Logos, that is the Word, becomes flesh and vice versa. Thebody dissolves in the fire of supernal orgasm, bringing forth the pure firesecreted within the fire: God. That the plant is expressed in the phallus isclear enough. The secret is contained in the words “the secretion anddissolution of this [tree].” At the height of passionate fire, the plantwithers, but its engendered virtue “liveth forever”; that is, the seed partakesof the substance of eternity: the new seed also has within it the hidden fire.This is a formula for the magical energizing of sexual fluids. Now perhaps wecan understand better the famous injunction in the Gnostic Gospel of Thomas thatIf you do not bring forth what is within you, what is within you will destroyyou: spiritual orgasm is salvation; suppression of the seed is death. That plantthat does not bring forth fruit unto the Lord will be swallowed up in itsexternal fire.Perhaps Crowley was confusing the meaning of sexual magick with issues oftechnique. Crowley asked Amalantrah how to “kill the sphinx” (or lion). Thereply: “Make fast the chains.” The chains bind the ship at the pier, preventingits being carried away by the waves. Further visions elicited from Crowley thequestion of whether the seed should grow cold in the cucurbite, and if so, forhow long? Was it until “creation takes place?” How many seconds or minutes? Thesymbol of Taurus suggested six minutes, but one feels they were barking up thewrong tree.Curiously, the following morning Crowley dictated to Arctaeon a vision of themind as a kind of spider’s web with ganglions glowing: an image with which weare all familiar from advertisements for headache pills with electrical impulsesin the brain shown as “live wires.” Things got stranger in the evening whenthere was debate with Amalantrah about who “Achita” really was. Was she the sameas Roddie? Was she a lesbian? No, she was not, said Roddie/Achita. Could Achitastay all the time as Achita, the astral being, and not return to Roddie? Roddiereplied as Achita that Roddie Minor was only earth, working and living. Achita“is spirit.” Achita was just one of many functions in Roddie Minor.Further interviews with Amalantrah brought into question whether Therion’squestions were not prejudicing possible avenues of knowledge. On Saturday, April27, at 10:08 p.m., the question turned back to the egg. Was not the egg a symbol“of some new knowledge”? asked Therion.12 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt553] Achitareplied, “Don’t ask questions too fast. Sow the wild oats; go into the . . .into the Mother—to be born again.” To which Arctaeon interjected, “I thinkyou’re both getting off the trolly.” And so might we. On the other hand, Roddieseemed to be getting a kind of vision of the Earth as a redeemed being, amother, feminine energy: the essence of the egg. There is even a hint of theplanet as we have now seen her from outer space, as she was seeing her frominner space. The egg appears in a lotus flower, suggesting the rejuvenation ofthe powers of Earth. Indeed, it all begins to sound, with benefit of hindsightof course, like the ecological spiritual revolution that has been struggling tofind definitive form for the past half century or so. “Going into the Mother tobe born again, you get a New Life, and then the Earth is covered with wonderfulflowers, and bees come to the flowers to get honey to store, and the honey isstored elixir. I see a hill very steep. . . . Mother standing . . . washingchild. I don’t know if she’s to save it or go after it or what. Lotus flower onWater again.” Arctaeon asks, “How does this apply to breaking the egg?” No, saysAchita, “the egg is in the lotus flower.” The “egg” seems to be a symbolcombining feminine energy rejuvenating Earth and vice versa. Crowley, as sooften, is impatient, especially when the subject goes off his chief interest,which is the “Mass of the Holy Ghost.” He then asked the wizard if they mighttry using a Ouija board to obtain the new knowledge. He might better havelistened more to Roddie. Perhaps the Beast simply wasn’t expecting a vision ofthe ecological “green” or “flower-power” awareness, Earth-consciousnessrevolution. Arguably, he was still fighting a war with Queen Victoria, as wellas playing John the Baptist to the New Aeon, announcing the fiery harvest.EVA TANGUAYCrowley’s Confessions account of this period elicits a certain confusion, as ifhe’d begun to “lose the plot” somewhat. Luckily he had his Chokmah dayrationalizations to add structure to teetering chaos. He wrote of three symbolic“scorpions” on the Magus’s mystic journey through the symbolic desert: DorothyTroxel (Wesrun), Marie Lavroff, and “supreme artist,” Eva Tanguay. How America’sgreatest star of vaudeville got involved in Greenwich Village’s occult naissanceis unclear. We only know that she was back in New York and between theatricalengagements in May. What is also not clear, according to Crowley’s own account,is whether he dealt with the scorpions as he should have, implying thatAmalantrah had a plan for the feminine triumvirate that he did not takeseriously enough.Hugely popular sensational solo singing and performing personality Eva Tanguay(1878–1947) spent her first six years in Quebec, before the family moved toHolyoke, Massachusetts, whence Eva embarked on a career in performing arts thatat its height around 1910 brought her as much as $3,500 a week, an enormous sum,which she spent lavishly. Her energetic songs and frenetic dance routines werewhimsical paeans to devil-may-care liberties, earning her the soubriquet the “Idon’t care girl” after hit song “I don’t care,” which you can hear on YouTube.The Tanguay broad humor and libertarian, down-to-earth sexuality paved the wayfor Mae West and many others, and Crowley recognized her genius in anenthusiastic article in April 1918’s edition of the International, his last.Surely, she never had an admirer so ardent, so keen to venerate her in thepantheon of Art.The American Genius is unlike all others. The “cultured” artist, in thiscountry, is always a mediocrity. . . . The Genius is invariably a man withoutgeneral culture. It seems to stifle him. The true American is, above all things,FREE; with all the advantages and disadvantages that that implies. His genius isa soul lonely, desolate, reaching to perfection in some unguessed direction. Itis the Fourth-Dimensional Component of force. It always jars upon the peoplewhose culture is broad and balanced and rooted in history. . . .Eva Tanguay is the perfect American artist. She is alone. She is the UnknownGoddess. She is ineffably, infinitely, sublime; she is starry chaste in hercolossal corruption. In Europe men obtain excitement through Venus, and preventVenus from freezing by invoking Bacchus and Ceres, as the poet bids. But inAmerica sex excitement has been analyzed; we recognize it to be merely aparticular case of a general proposition, and we proceed to find our pleasure inthe wreck of the nervous system as a whole, instead of a mere section of it. Thedaily rush of New York resembles the effect of cocaine; it is a universalstimulation, resulting in a premature general collapse; and Eva Tanguay is theperfect artistic expression of this. She is Manhattan, most loved, most hated,of all cities, whose soul is a Delirium beyond Time and Space. Wine? Brandy?Absinthe? Bah! Such mother-milk is for the babes of effete Europe; we knowbetter. Drunkenness is a silly partial exaltation, feeble device of mostempirical psychology; it cannot compare with the adult, the transcendentaldelights of pure madness. (I suppose I ought to couch these remarks in the toneof an indictment; but though the literary spirit is willing, the fountain pen isweak.) Why titillate one poor nerve? Why not excite all together? Leavesentiment to Teutons, passion and romance to Latins, spirituality to Slavs; forus is cloudless, definite, physiological pleasure!Eva Tanguay is—exactly and scientifically—this Soul of America. She steps uponthe stage, and I come into formal consciousness of myself in accurate detail asthe world vanishes. She absorbs me, not romantically, like a vampire, butdefinitely, like an anaesthetic, soul, mind, body, with her first gesture. Sheis not dressed voluptuously, as others dress; she is like the hashish dream of ahermit who is possessed of the devil. She cannot sing, as others sing; or dance,as others dance. She simply keeps on vibrating, both limbs and vocal chords,without rhythm, tone, melody, or purpose. She has the quality of Eternity; sheis metaphysical motion. She eliminates repose. She has my nerves,sympathetically irritated, on a razor-edge which is neither pleasure nor pain,but sublime and immedicable stimulation. I feel as if I were poisoned bystrychnine, so far as my body goes; I jerk, I writhe, I twist, I find no ease;and I know absolutely that no ease is possible. For my mind, I am like one whohas taken an overdose of morphine and, having absorbed the drug in a wakefulmood, cannot sleep, although utterly tired out. And for my soul? Oh! Oh!—Oh!“Satan prends pitié de ma longue misère!”*173 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft173]I could kill myself at this moment for the wild love of her—(Love? It is Poison!I say the love of her)—that sets my soul ablaze with fire of hell, and my nervesshrieking; at my left hand is my eighth Absinthe, and at my right a nearby emptyounce bottle of cocaine; I am using this combination of drugs as sedative, notas stimulant. She is the one woman whom I would marry—oh sacrament and asymptoteof blasphemy! There is a woman of the Ukraine, expert in Mystic Vice, coming todestroy me body and soul, in an hour’s time; to make of me a new Mazeppa. But Iknow that she will not absolve me nor assuage me. I shall still writhe in theflames of my passion for America—for Eva Tanguay.13[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt554]At which the writer lapsed into a rhapsody of French exclamations of desireclosing on a swoon of love’s conquest. Whether literature was realized inphysical passion, no history records, but when some six years later heconsidered Eva’s place in his life, he decided her “self-worship” had spoiledthings. Eva appears by acronym in the Rex record but not in person as assistant.Eva was at the time going through a protracted divorce from accompanist John W.Ford, who vigorously contested her affidavit, filed in Chicago the previousDecember. This did not stop Crowley, of course. The first reference to Eva inthe Rex record occurs on May 10, 1918, when a sex-magick operation with Roddiewas dedicated to “Success through Eva.” On the twelfth Crowley asked Amalantrahfor a “geometric figure” of his—presumably intended—relations with her; on theeighteenth he asked the wizard for Eva’s magical number. Sex magick with Roddieagain on the twenty-first: to marry “E.T.” A week later, similarly, this timefor Eva Tanguay’s “favour.”image [images/9781620556313_067.jpg]Fig. 31.2. Hot Stuff: Eva Tanguay in The Wild Girl (Selznick Pictures, October1917)Amalantrah’s advice concerning three “Dragons” on June 3 obviously applies tothe “scorpions” since Crowley summed up the advice as “an astonishingly gooddescription of Darola [Eva’s magical name, revealed by Amalantrah on May 18],Wesrun [Troxel] and Olun [Marie].”14 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt555] The wizardused Chinese trigrams with numerical equivalents to delineate the dragons andwhat to do with them. Thus, the first, “Bold Woman”: treat with humility andintegrity, but also flatter; second, “Docility”: marry; third, “Pleasure—stillwater”: maintain harmony, satisfaction. The problem is that it is not clearwhich dragon was which. Eva might have been first or second dragon. Crowleyhoped to redeem Dorothy Troxel from a state of fundamental confusion, she beingthe “maid” or virgin, of Crowley’s trio, with Marie the “wife” and Eva the“whore.”It would appear the “whore” did not stick around Crowley’s circle for muchlonger as her name slips from the record. She had a pressing theatrical careerand valued her personal freedom highly, as her filing for an increasinglyacrimonious divorce indicates. If Crowley did raise the issue of marriage withher, it could have been his undoing; or, possibly, it was that he did not offerher marriage. Crowley never let on what the “great miss” was that he thoughthe’d made as regards his relations with the three women. And Eva probably didn’tcare.A new arrival into the Beast’s lair appeared on June 9. Fresh faced and cheeky,Midshipman Cecil Frederick Russell (1897–1987), from Annapolis’s naval academy,had been inspired by Crowley’s International account of the “Revival of Magick.”It was his twenty-first birthday, and he celebrated by signing the Aimage[images/dots.jpg]Aimage [images/dots.jpg] probationer’s oath. Crowley chose hismotto, “Genesthai,” Greek for “to have been born,” in the sense of spiritualbecoming. That evening, C. S. Jones and wife, Ruby, assisted Crowley in rushingRussell through the O.T.O.’s first three degrees. Crowley had high hopes forRussell, seeing that he possessed willpower, devil-may-care energy, and nativeintelligence. He also rather fancied the “sailor boy” and, according to Russell,made abortive homosexual moves on him after the war when Crowley invited Russellto his experimental Thelemic community at Cefalù, Sicily. In 1922, Russellfounded the “Choronzon Club” in Chicago, its secret inner name being the“Gnostic Body of God.” While marketing Crowley’s books and teachings, Russell,like Jones, went increasingly his own way and attempted to sell an anti-Crowleyseries of articles to the Hearst Press in September 1922.*174[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft174]The Amalantrah operation wound up in the middle of June, with Roddie feeling“fucked out” generally, a condition that by the twenty-third had degeneratedinto a temporary “Vision of the Demon Crowley.”15[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt556] This was Crowley’s standard expression forsomething that occasionally overcame acquaintances or followers. Crowleymaintained that he had no wish to dominate others’ freedom, but certain persons’deeper fears could be triggered into involuntary projection upon him, which,given his offbeat wavelength, philosophy, strangely spiritual vibe, andapparently fearless, unrestrained, and psychedelically tolerant psyche, is notvery surprising. He might have entertained an “enlightened” view of the wordSatan, and a positive accommodation of “pagan” antiquity, but for most people,the first absorbed meaning of those words went very deep to become synonymouswith fear of evil, disintegration, punishment, or the abysmal unknown per se.Most got over it; some never quite did, or do. Beast and Camel agreed to breakup the menage, while remaining in touch, and when Crowley began his “GreatMagical Retirement” on July 19, she joined him early on, bringing supplies,goodwill, hugs, and jugs."},{"pageContent":"THIRTY-TWOimage [images/9781620556313_099.jpg]IslandIt is not clear when Crowley first met Hearst yellow journalist andproto-Hemingway literary personality, William B. Seabrook (1864–1946), butacquaintance had blossomed into friendship by mid 1918. Whether Seabrook’semployer’s isolationist, anti-British, and soft-on-Germans stance influencedCrowley’s interest in the Greenwich Village habitué is unknown, but it waspro-German Frank Harris who introduced them. And it was Seabrook who providedCrowley with canoe and tent, with which elementary accoutrements the Magus beganpaddling some 90 miles up the Hudson through New York State in the generaldirection of Staatsburg on July 19 for his “Great Magical Retirement.” He hadthe princely sum of two dollars and twenty-five cents, and the mind-set ofPrince Gautama voluntarily quitting “luxury” for penniless Nirvana. Except, asfar as we know, the founder of Buddhism was not spying on the side.Two days before Crowley’s modest departure upstream, Attorney General AlfredBecker summoned him to offices at the six-story brick Murray Hill Hotel on ParkAvenue, between 40th and 41st Streets, close to Grand Central.*175[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft175] Operating in a Gothic nest below the hotel’scastellated corner towers, Becker was hot on the trail of German attempts toexploit firebrands sparking off the Russian Revolution in subversive plots.Manhattan’s Russian consulate was a hive of competing factions, reflectingMoscow and Petrograd’s power struggle. According to Spence, Marie Lavrova (orLavroff) was ward to Apollonarii Semenovskii, linked to Russiancounterintelligence, assigned by Kerenskii’s Russian provisional government toNew York’s consulate general.1 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt557]Department of Justice, Bureau of Investigation agents were out to bust a groupof female agents with Russian links working for Germany. One such wasRussian-Jewish Despina Dawidovitch Storch, in touch with “corrupt Russians” alsobeing spied upon by Semenovskii and by Crowley’s friend anti-tsarist andanti-Bolshevik Ivan Narodny. Spence observed that the B.I., led bySuperintendent Charles de Woody, discovered Storch’s spying on munitionsshipments shortly after Crowley encountered Lavrov in late 1917. Storch’soperation infiltrated, she was picked up in March 1918. Having named accomplicesBaroness von Seidlitz and Maria de Victorica, Storch promptly died of mysteriouscauses in custody.On July 17, Becker’s agents questioned Crowley2 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt558]about the Propaganda Kabinett and his part in Viereck’s schemes, exhibitingparticular interest in Viereck’s correspondent Edward Rumley, pro-German editorof the New York Evening Mail.3 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt559]*176[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft176]Crowley’s Confessions gives a very fine description of the difficultiesencountered ascending the Hudson by canoe, a task “not so simple as it sounds.”4[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt560] Some 25 miles south of Esopus Island, hisdestination, Crowley ran into a perilous squall, which took him all his nativesense to survive, reaching the shore in darkness at Newburgh, a town straddlingboth sides of the broad river, joined by a ferry. Crowley makes light of thedenouement of the adventure, which Spence thinks more significant.Having become acquainted by helpful boatmen with the kind old captain of theboat club, Crowley, deeply sunburned with an inch of beard and looking like aruffian, was introduced to an Englishman. Amazingly, wealthy businessmanJonathan T. Whitehead, owner of a summer home on the Hudson, was acquainted withCrowley’s aunt Annie, having known her when he worked at a school in Coventry,Warwickshire. He also had good connections with New York’s consulate, whichmakes Spence think the chance too improbable to be chance at all. Whiteheadlater visited Crowley at his camp on Esopus Island, a long strip bounded byrocks, low cliffs, and creeks, bringing with him prawns, which Crowley had justdreamed about. “If Crowley needed a cut-out to stay in contact with New York,Whitehead fit the bill perfectly.”5 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt561] Spence hasanother theory to explain, at least in part, Crowley’s choice of theNewburgh-Poughkeepsie-Staatsburg area.On July 9 assistant secretary of the Navy Franklin Roosevelt went to Europe on aU.S. destroyer. Arriving in England, he was guest of N.I.D. head Admiral“Blinker” Hall, who showed Roosevelt around British Naval Intelligence,Roosevelt having cooperated with Guy Gaunt and Norman Thwaites before the UnitedStates entered the war. While Roosevelt was in Europe, N.I.D. officer Guy VarleyRayment, with an admiralty brief for intelligence on Indian sedition, was arecent arrival to New York. According to Spence, Rayment, who assisted withdetails of Roosevelt’s trip, chose the unlikely billet of Greenwich Village’sHotel, on arriving on July 4. A favorite dining place of Crowley’s, theBrevoort,*177 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft177] frequented by the village’sbohemian literati, was close to West 9th Street.6[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt562]Interestingly, the Brevoort features in a casual note written by Crowley in 1923to follower Norman Mudd regarding what Mudd needed to know to understand anallusion in one of Crowley’s poems.I complained (1918 or 19) on the steps of the Brevoort Hotel that KateSeabrook’s lips-rouge was permanently staining my glans penis. I did this inmetaphor, of course, with all possible decorum of speech; but the cognoscentiunderstood, and the incident became famous all over New York.7[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt563]image [images/9781620556313_068.jpg]image [images/9781620556313_069.jpg]Fig. 32.1. Esopus Island, in the Hudson River, upstate New York; (below) thenorthern tip of the island. Crowley camped at the island’s southern end. (photosby Gregory von Seewald, courtesy of James Wasserman)Kate Seabrook was W. B. Seabrook’s wife, a relationship mostly platonic,sufficiently so anyway for Seabrook to “lend” Kate to Crowley while Seabrookhimself explored a compelling penchant for sadomasochistic fantasy sex gameswith fellow enthusiasts.Roosevelt’s home “Springwood,” in Hyde Park, was only 4 miles south of EsopusIsland, on the Hudson’s eastern banks, between Poughkeepsie and Staatsburg,which combination of coincidences leads Spence to wonder, not entirelyimplausibly, whether Becker, who was familiar with Roosevelt through statepolitics, or Rayment, put Crowley on the case of watching Roosevelt’s home inhis absence, lest a Münter-style attack assail Springwood as it had JackMorgan’s Long Island residence three years earlier. Far-fetched perhaps, but, aswe shall see, Crowley’s magical retirement was not all meditative R and R; hecarried a revolver.When Crowley suffered slanderous attacks in the British press in 1922 and 1923,which led to personal catastrophe, he felt sufficiently confident that he wouldget a hearing from the U.S. Justice Department in his favor that he asked NormanMudd to request that they comment in Crowley’s defense as he could not affordthe thousands necessary for a proper libel action in England. Mudd began byindicating how Crowley had penetrated Viereck and J. Bernard Rethy’s propagandaoperation.He camouflaged himself in the most thorough-going way, taking, for instance, allpossible steps to get the English press and his own personal friends in Englandto denounce in earnest his apparent treachery. His positive policy was toencourage the pro-German group in America to state quite openly its true moralprinciples and its real attitudes to the Government and people of the UnitedStates.He did this firstly by personal influence on Viereck, Rethy, and Münsterberg,partly by contributing articles in the Fatherland and partly by editing theInternational. After the entrance into the war of the US, he was incommunication with your Department and supplied it with information as to theunderground activities of many organizations. In particular he helped in thebreak-up of the group which worked under the name “The Agricultural LaborBureau.”I have no doubt that you will have in your archives some dossier dealing withall the activities with Mr. Crowley in the period November 1914 to December1919. Apart from these reports to your Department he was necessarily compelledto maintain the greatest secrecy as to his motives and proceedings, but I thinkthat Mr. Otto Kahn knew a great deal about them and advised Mr. Crowley fromtime to time. I do not think that any other private citizen was ever in Mr.Crowley’s confidence in the matter.Mr. Crowley has, since the War, often been attacked sporadically by the Britishgutter press for disloyalty to his country during the War. Being a very busyman, wholly engrossed with creative literary work, and having neither time normoney to spend on legal actions he has hitherto been compelled to disregard suchslanders, awaiting a time when he can vindicate himself, fully and finally, inhis Autobiography which he hopes to publish in the course of a year or so.8[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt564]Nothing untoward occurred on Crowley’s first weekend on Esopus Island, bar adangerously late canoe trip, loaded down with Roddie Minor and a hoard of cannedfood, after Roddie, as Crowley complained in best Professor Higgins style,underestimated the distance between the neat, colonial-style bungalow ofStaatsburg’s New York Central Railroad station*178[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft178] and the island. “The train was late, night wasfalling, the wind was getting up, and the rain beginning to skirmish.”9[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt565] It took some five hours to paddle 3 miles inappalling conditions, with Roddie cursing everything and the Beast especially.But when they got up in the morning, and the sun had dried the wet rocks, theylooked at the creek and its lilies, and each other, and it felt very good.With Roddie back for work in New York at the weekend’s end, Crowley beganworking on his own transliteration of the Tao-Te Ching. He was always very proudof “his” version, feeling that a true translation required more than linguisticskills; you had to understand the consciousness of the mind that composed theoriginal and what the mere words pointed to. He may have shared the mentality ofthe work’s progenitor, but Crowley certainly lacked the linguistic skills totranslate from the Chinese. The French Taoist initiate Matgioï suffered from nosuch deficit. Edmond Bailly’s Librairie de l’Art Indépendant had publishedMatgioï’s translation of the Chinese classic back in 1893, so Crowley was addinghis strokes to quite well-trodden territory.The same could not be said of another feature of his summer operations. Crowleygot down to some serious sammasati. Determined to uncover once and for all hisprevious incarnations, he assumed a crosslegged yogic posture and practiceddhyana. Locals who saw him thought him mad or marvelous; farmers brought himeggs to eat, as would peasants feed a bhikku in Burma. On August 3 the Magustried to enter trance but it was no use. “What’s wrong? If this goes on, I shallbe eligible for membership in the TS,”*179 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft179] hequipped.On August 8 he experienced a breakthrough. In the document called The Hermit ofOesopus Island,†180 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft180] he recorded how “the magicalmemory is the unveiling of the subconsciousness; therefore as I awaken it I findthat episodes of my conscious life count less than things built into theunconscious.”At 9:50 p.m. consciousness emerged of his infancy, then—most vividly—his birth,afterward the prenatal stage.Next I found myself as Eliphas Lévi, dying, and then went through quite a numberof scenes in that life, mostly unimportant, though I remember several episodeswith my wife. (I can’t remember her name, though Crowley knows it well[sic]—Freudian forgetfulness, evidently) and the scenes of my taking variousorders in Catholicism. . . . I don’t seem to remember much about Vintras;‡181[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft181] what I do get very vividly—in patches—is mydealings with the Illuminati. There was a tall man, very thin, very dark,clean-shaven, stern with a cruel smile, who was one of their chiefs in Paris. Hewas a man of “infamous character,” and very skillful in Magick. He had much todo with fathering the De Guaita-Huysmans crowd. He initiated me in a ceremonyrather like Élus des Neuf, where one has to kill a traitor.*182[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft182]10 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt566]On August 10, C. S. Jones joined Crowley on Esopus Island as newly appointedgrand treasurer general (replacing George Macnie Cowie) and deputy grand mastergeneral. What he and Crowley did between Jones’s arrival and departure on August16 is unknown as Jones later destroyed his magical record of the period.THE REDHEAD STRIKESFew of Crowley’s adventures in America, lurid or otherwise, quite match up tohis encounter with redheaded, game-for-anything Madeleine George. The expressiongrand guignol hardly seems adequate.It began amid the heat of August 19, 1918, when only a few astrologers wereconvinced the Great War would be over in less than three bloody months. Thehighly selective Confessions account starts in simple fashion. Crowley felt hehad to leave the island for two days “on OTO business.”11[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt567] This involved him and Jones establishing bankaccounts for receiving members’ payments. Crowley assured Jones that a few goodpatrons could achieve what was required, a stance that irritated Jones, whobelieved Crowley had intended to change the world through opening up the O.T.O.to humanity in the numerical sense. Jones did not approve of raising money frommembers to be used for the Beast’s personal financing. Surely the O.T.O.’s taskwas the liberation of humanity at large. The issue played on Jones’s mind, andon August 27 he wrote a letter of resignation from the O.T.O. that bemusedCrowley and shocked Jones’s friend and O.T.O. brother Wilfred Talbot Smith. ByFebruary 1919, Jones had withdrawn his resignation, convinced again that theO.T.O. was good for the world’s needs.Crowley’s other requirement in returning to New York on August 19 might alsopass under the “OTO business” rubric. He sought a sexual assistant, pursuant towhich end he hastened to “old friend” Tony Sarg, this being Crowley’s solereference to a remarkable artist and innovative puppeteer who occupied a studioin Times Square.*183 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft183]Times Square in 1918 was a considerably more spacious and stately affair thantoday. The Times Building resembled a thinner slice of the cake from which theFlatiron Building was cut; it dominated the crossways intersection, above thetrolley cars and Broadway theater and Macy’s electrical signs. The sky passedun-scraped.Anthony Frederick Sarg (1880–1942) was the son of Francis Charles Sarg, theGerman empire’s consul in Guatemala, where Sarg was born. His mother, MaryElizabeth Parker, was English. Aged fourteen, Sarg entered Darmstadt militaryacademy in Germany, eventually resigning his commission for a life in England in1905, on condition that he return for periodic reservist duties.†184[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft184]In England, Sarg wooed American Bertha Eleanor McGowan, whom he met when shetoured Germany. Marrying in her home town of Cincinatti, Ohio, in 1909, theyreturned to England until war broke out in 1914, when wife and children returnedto Cincinatti, afterward to be joined by Sarg, who then settled his family inNew York in 1915. Before leaving London’s East End—which fascinated him—heproduced a postcard showing a German shopkeeper trying to de-Germanize hisstorefront in the face of local anti-German hysteria. It was a joke, but thebackground was serious, and threatening.While developing a puppetry hobby into a business in 1917, Sarg’s wittyillustrations for the Saturday Evening Post and other magazines earned him areputation in Gotham’s art community, which brought him to greater success afterthe war as movie animation pioneer, writer of children’s books, and puppeteer onthe grand scale. It was Tony Sarg who pioneered the Macy’s Thanksgiving giantpuppet and balloon figure parade that started in 1924 and continues to this day.Back to Crowley, out for “skirt” in August 1918: he told Sarg he’d found hisparadise on Esopus Island; that is, but for one fly in the ointment—he had no“Eve.” Sarg had the answer: “a girl game for any adventure. She has wonderfulhair—orange-red curls, calculated to produce delirium tremens at a moment’snotice.” Sarg directed Crowley to the hotel where the incomparable MadeleineGeorge resided. After frolics at the studio—with Sarg hilariously imitatingCrowley wooing a girl to the delight of those present—Crowley left a note atMadeleine’s hotel, not expecting her to reply to his invitation to lunch atEsopus any convenient day.image [images/9781620556313_070.jpg]Fig. 32.3. Tony Sarg, “the Father of Modern American Puppetry,” with some of hispuppets for “Rip van Winkle” at the Assembly Theatre, 1929image [images/9781620556313_071.jpg]Fig. 32.3. Tony Sarg, “the Father of Modern American Puppetry,” with some of hispuppets for “Rip van Winkle” at the Assembly Theatre, 1929What Crowley apparently did not know—and in this case, appearances may bedeceptive—was that Madeleine George was of interest to other parties, oneofficial, one not. First: The unofficial interest. This apparently (that wordagain!) began after Crowley’s invitation from Sarg to meet his game friend.In Crowley’s pal Bill Seabrook’s autobiography No Hiding Place (1942), writtenafter a lifetime of trying to establish a respectable literary reputation inGreenwich Village, Seabrook states that Tony Sarg’s studio was where he firstencountered a puppeteer (Sarg’s assistant) he calls “Deborah Luris,” presumablyto protect her innocence, or his own. The lady taught him much about sex, andabout himself.Further details emerge in Emily Matchar’s The Zombie King, a recent shortbiography of Seabrook, the “man who introduced Zombies to America.” According toMatchar, it was after a long, drunken lunch with friends in New York thatSeabrook entered Sarg’s studio, there to meet “Deborah Luris” and to be pulledlike a moon to a planet by the girl’s sexual frankness and “broad animal face.”Seabrook wrote her a pained plea that she participate in kinky games. “Sure, whynot?” replied “Luris.” “Come on up. But why be so solemn and self-consciousabout it? It might be fun.” Seabrook confessed his feelings to first wife, Kate,who approved his buying locks and chains at Hammacher Schlemmer on 13th Streetand 4th Avenue. Seabrook spent a delirious week in S&M fantasyville at Luris’sNew York apartment. “When people uncork parallel or complimentary chimericwish-fantasies, sparks generally fly. And so they did,” reflected Seabrook. Theonly trouble with Seabrook was an uncontrollable urge to embellish as manystories as possible with his fantasies, even having himself discover Crowley inGreenwich Village indulging in S&M sessions with Leah, blood from whippingscarring her slender back. Were it anyone but Seabrook telling the tales, youmight credit it—but Seabrook was truly obsessed with sex and voodoo. Crowleyundoubtedly found him a peculiarly amusing case for observation, and vice versa,with the emphasis on vice.Seabrook’s reputation for excess earned him a painful snub from Theodore Dreiserin the village—one that, typically, drove Seabrook to drink—Dreiser dismissingSeabrook as a “yellow journalist”; that is, a hack, with a facility for nicheyarns of lurid-as-possible supernatural sensationalism enmired in sex crime.image [images/9781620556313_072.jpg]Fig. 32.4. Ward Greene (1893–1956)One of Seabrook’s friends in Atlanta, and Decatur—where the Seabrooks had afarm—was fellow Hearst-man Ward Greene (1893–1956). Author of The Lady and theTramp, Greene would be a pallbearer at Hearst’s funeral in 1951. Ride theNightmare (1930), one of Greene’s novels, was based on Seabrook’s colorful life,with “Jake Perry” standing in for Seabrook. In the novel, Jake inherits amasochistic playmate called “Justine” from “Bellerophon Cawdor,” who standsfor—that’s right—Aleister Crowley. In Seabrook’s Witchcraft (Its Power in theWorld Today) (1940) he calls his fellow sex/psychic experimenter in New York“Justine.” Paul Pipkin’s The Fan-Shaped Destiny of William Seabrook: A Romanceof Many Worlds refers to Seabrook’s second wife, Marjorie (née) Worthington’s,reminiscences of life at Sanay, where Seabrook was drying out in the South ofFrance in 1933. Marjorie remembered Ward Greene visiting them and mentioned aredheaded gypsy cook at Les Roseaux (their home) and a redhead called . . .Madeleine.image [images/img_002.jpg]Back to Crowley on Tuesday, August 20, 1918: Below the Tribune’s headline U.S.WILL WIN THE WAR IN 1919, Says [General] MARCH ran the story, FIGHT ON HEARSTPAPERS HAS BEGUN, with 1,200 newsdealers in Brooklyn refusing to handle Hearstpapers due to Hearst’s trying to fix the market in his favor by pressuringdealers not to sell other publishers’ papers unless they sold his as well. InPetrograd, Bolsheviks initiated a reign of terror, with an estimated thirtythousand middle-class Russians arrested in a week. New York’s 7:00 a.m.temperature was around 65°F with humidity at 73 percent: sticky conditions forCrowley and Roddie’s IX° operation that morning for “Magic Power.”Next day, Crowley was back on Esopus Island. Having taken the train and alightedat either Hyde Park or Staatsburg, he visited a local store to buy about fourcans of red paint. Marrying his artistic soul to his will to spread the Law,Crowley paddled across to the island, where he suspended himself over the smoothrock of its clifflike banks (about a man’s height) and painted the words DO WHATTHOU WILT boldly for the edification and wonder of regular passing riverboatpassengers. This he did on the island’s western and eastern sides; the messagewas unavoidable. If he could have afforded electrical bulbs on Times Square forthe same purpose, he would have done that too. The remaining paint he splashedonto a tree by his tent, spelling out MADELEINE, which word also adorned anearby rock: the first graffiti-magick since maybe the imprisoned Templars’carved symbols on their prison walls at Chinon, France, in 1307. Crowley thenreturned to his sammasati trances in search of previous incarnations.Meanwhile, back in New York, Attorney General Becker’s men were also hot for“Madeline” (sic), though not in Crowley’s red-paint sense. Whether they hadalready acquainted Crowley with their interest is unknown; such would makelogical sense of what was about to ensue, but all secret service records arepermeated with irreducibly crooked elements. Becker accessed a Bureau ofInvestigation report dated April 23, 1918, describing Madeline George as apetite brunette “aspiring actress,” twice divorced. One husband complained thatshe was “very erratic and an adventuress,” capable of just about anything.12[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt568] According to Spence, Madeline had recentlyattracted British Intelligence concern for having entertained a number ofofficers in a Montreal hotel room. While the picture emerged of a Mata Hari incontact with arrested German agent Baroness von Sedlitz and suspected agentEdward Rumley,13 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt569] no evidence has emerged thatshe was spying for anyone.Crowley’s subconscious was often out of synch with recorded history. When heundertook to live “in the past once more” on the late afternoon of August 22, heexperienced “his” death as magician and High Freemason Cagliostro (1743–1795) onthe high wooded slopes, he was sure, of the Pyrenees. Crowley had nothing tocontribute to the mystery of Cagliostro’s birth, generally supposed to have beenthat of Giuseppe Balsamo in Palermo. Condemned by the Inquisition as aFreemason, Cagliostro, as he styled himself, died tragically at the Fortress ofSan Leo on the border of Marche and Romagna, Italy. Crowley believed he got his“Secret Society ideas” from Cagliostro, who took them to the French court tospread a Law. Crowley did think he’d solved one mystery around the Masonicmagician.14 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt570]After Cagliostro’s death a seal was found showing a serpent, pierced with anarrow, holding an apple in its mouth with the acronym “L.P.D.” (described inLévi’s History of Magic). Crowley took the acronym as Laus Priapo Deo—“Praise tothe god Priapus”—which you can take or leave. Crowley took it to mean his Law,as Cagliostro, was phallicism—the cross as sun-phallus-god: creative self-givingin ecstasy. Crowley had already taken the L.P.D. acronym as monogram for hisOrder of the L.I.L., founded in Mexico City in 1900–1901 with Don Jesús Medina.In trance, Crowley experienced “a kind of profess-house, some ten years ornearly before my death. It was kept by a disciple, a man of thirty or forty,with a dark brown beard, pointed. He procured young girls for me; I used thesein some experiments to make the Elixir of Life & Youth.”15[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt571]Crowley’s Cagliostro was Crowley’s Cagliostro.At 5:10 p.m. on August 25 the Beast returned to “memories” experienced theprevious evening of an incarnation prior to the Sicilian phallicist: oneHeinrich von (or van) Dorn apparently hanged himself between twenty-six andtwenty-eight after a life of futile black magic. Before that incarnation, thebeing who became Crowley was known as “Father Ivan,” born around 1650, a Russianlibrarian in a castle of military monks, possibly in southern Poland or theBalkans. Sent by noble parents for an education in Germany, he habituallyinvoked “the Devil” (Crowley’s quotation marks). Ivan “had a round face—ratherlike Otto Kahn—ashen hair and a moustache, a pale and ruddy skin, gray eyes,small even teeth, a short well-shaped body.”16 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt572]He believed his “favourite page” and magical disciple, one Stephen Otto, was nowCrowley’s admired novelist James Branch Cabell (1879–1958), which sounds likewishful thinking.He’d have to settle for Madeleine George for the time being. According to theConfessions, no sooner had Crowley painted Madeleine’s name on a tree than a manappeared in a boat from the mainland carrying a telegram alerting him to thelady’s imminent appearance at Hyde Park station. Madeleine must in fact havearrived some time between the twenty-sixth and Saturday, the thirty-first ofAugust, with the latter date most likely as Crowley had magical sex with hervery early on September 1. She hadn’t come for the fishing.Hyde Park railroad station has been preserved, a few miles down the Hudson fromEsopus Island, sited adjacent to the river: a simple, single story, oblong,mottled brick structure with a first course of stone supporting a sloping tiledroof and pleasant wooden-framed canopy with Edwardian-era gables. It sets you upfor the pleasant Old World charm of the area. Crowley describes himself pacingthe low platform waiting for the New York Central Railroad train.I noticed a tall, distinguished, military-looking man, who seemed to be eyeingme strangely. He finally made up his mind to speak. “Are you Mr. Crowley?” hesaid. In my surprise I nearly forgot to say, “Do what thou wilt shall be thewhole of the Law.” We then got into conversation.17[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt573]Crowley says the man introduced himself as running “Intelligence” in DachersCounty, New York, whereupon Crowley confided to him that he was working for theDepartment of Justice, on the lookout for suspicious incidents: a somewhatunlikely first exchange. The man asked Crowley to report anything of the kind tohim also. The man then told Crowley that he—Crowley—had had all Staatsburg “onthe grill,” with folk wondering who the man was who spent hours stock still.Such reports had brought the “colonel” to the scene as part of his inquiries.Only the watchful eye of a girl at the post office had identified him. She hadspotted the gold tassles on his golf stockings! The man said he had had Crowleywatched and found nothing wrong (“of course,” adds Crowley) but had been amazedwhen New York informed him that he was working for the Department of Justice. Hethen confided to Crowley that there had been sinister rumors about spies in thevicinity. Crowley says he doubted the necessity for his interlocutor’s labor,but the man told Crowley of strange lights on the west shore at night,suggesting signaling, especially as troops were carried to New York by nighttrain; spies might signal troop estimates. Crowley promised to keep watch.In fact, the man was still watching him. Crowley makes light of what must havebeen a difficult conversation, for the watcher was Major James B. Ord, M.I.D.’sresident officer at West Point, keeping an eye on the Lower Hudson Valley.18[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt574] What Crowley’s account does not tell us is thatOrd reported to M.I.D. (Military Intelligence Department) in Washington thatCrowley interested his office on account of his connection to Madeleine George.This suggests intelligence had intercepted Madeleine’s telegram (at the postoffice where the watchful girl worked?), or Crowley had reported Madeleine’simminent arrival to the Department of Justice. Ord inquired about Crowley withNew York’s Bureau of Investigation in the person of Charles de Woody, from whichOrd was apprised that Crowley worked for British Intelligence, that he had beeninvestigated and cleared by Attorney General Becker.image [images/9781620556313_073.jpg]Fig. 32.5. Major James B. Ord, M.I.D.’s resident officer at West Point,investigated Crowley at Esopus Island in connection with Madeleine George. WatchReport, headed “Headquarters, United States Military Academy, West Point, NewYork”; September 23, 1918. (National Archive)As can be seen from the last line of the following Watch Report, headed“Headquarters, United States Military Academy, West Point, New York,” Ord,taught to be cautious, was not at this point totally reassured about Crowley’sloyalties, a doubt that resurfaced after J. Edgar Hoover assumed control of theBureau of Investigation in August 1919.16. Aleister Crowley—English subject. Previous correspondence: [handwritten:“None”]Subject has been camping on Esopus Island, Hudson River and was brought toattention of this office by subject’s connections with Madeline George, anactress of New York City who had formerly been investigated by the Department ofJustice on charges of being a German spy. It was determined that AleisterCrowley was an employee of the British Government but at present in this countryon official business of which the British Counsel [sic], New York City has fullcognizance. However, he has been formerly investigated by the Attorney GeneralBecker’s office in connection with the activities of George Verick [sic], andthe propaganda in New York City. It was found that the British Government wasfully aware of the fact that Crowley was connected with this German propagandaand had received money for writing anti-British articles. This case has beenturned over to the N.Y. State Attorney General’s Office, for such action as hemay deem advisable. In view of the information which has been gathered withinthe past two months [August–September] it may be possible that Aleister Crowleyis double crossing the British Government. However, the case has not beencompleted as yet.19 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt575]Spence considers it likely that Becker’s men had primed Crowley to outwitMadeleine George and seduce secrets from her. This Spence deduces fromMadeleine’s discovering Crowley’s gun hidden in his bed-clothes. She allegedlythrew it into the bushes, fearing he was going to lead a “squad ofsecret-service men” back to the island, presumably to arrest her. BecauseCrowley nowhere else suggested any connection between the girl and espionage,this detail does seem an odd giveaway, it is true. Even his conversation withthe major on Hyde Park station mentioned nothing about Madeleine in Crowley’stelling, so he obviously knew more than he chose to relate.Crowley plays the whole Madeleine incident for laughs, with a plug about how hehelped the intelligence services with his observational skills. Crowley says herarrival at the station—short, sturdy, trimly tailored with round smiling faceframed in a “pyrotechnic” display of hair—outdid any description of her by Sarg(or anyone else?). She sounds like Crowley’s ideal, Jeanne Foster. Crowleyrelates a comedic tale of Madeleine playing hard to get, her phony excuse ofseeing her brother, incumbent at Staatsburg (!) frustrated by the canoe’sspringing a leak, and their only being saved by two boys pulling in the sinkingcanoe. When, after protestations, Crowley agreed to get the boys to take herback to the mainland; she said, “No.” She had come, and she would stay. And she“swooned” into his embrace. The diary record tells us that in an operationdedicated to “Constructive Magical Energy” that embrace unfolded its majesty at5:20 a.m. on Sunday, September 1, followed by another the next day.The diary describes Madeleine as married, redheaded, small, well formed, withSol on cusp of Leo, with probably Scorpio or Sagittarius rising. The Elixir was“rather thin.” Crowley says that during her stay (he says he took her back toCentral Park on Tuesday, September 3) he cracked the flashing-lights mystery,caused, he ascertained on investigation, by a passing train on the west shorewhose funnel glowed where the wood thinned out. On the second night he noticedafter 10:00 p.m. two men in a boat with a “shapeless heap” in the stern, whichcould have been cargo or a man. Using muffled oars, the business was likelysecret. Next day he found his revolver missing, and suspicions grew when he andthe boys saw a strange man just after dark disappear into the trees.Crowley says that he called on the “colonel” (he doesn’t say where) to reporthis findings, as promised. He learned of fresh suspicions that the Germans mightbe sending a pocket submarine up the Hudson, which seemed unlikely, but fearswere high. According to Crowley he returned to find that one of the boys haddiscovered the missing gun, whereupon Madeleine admitted to having found itearlier in the tent and, being afraid of it, had thrown it into the brushwood.The implication here is that Crowley had told her he was going to see anintelligence officer about the mysterious lights and other odd happenings, andthis made her scared of being found near a weapon, lest she be arrested. Theslant is different to that which Spence puts on the account, but it is clever ofCrowley to tell it in this apparently innocuous way. He perhaps had his ownreasons for not directly implicating Madeleine in espionage, if, that is, heever suspected she was involved. Certainly the Confessions account cannot betaken at face value.Crowley’s coda to “the joke” (as he typically described the events) came afterhis “retirement” ended on September 9. Back in New York, the “secret service,unaware of my relation with the colonel, got wind of the rumours about themysterious hermit and sent two men to investigate.” According to Crowley, theyfound a desolate island and “no more illuminating clues to crime than the words‘Madeleine’ and ‘Do what thou wilt’ on the rocks.”20[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt576] One rather suspects that the mysterious figuresin the boat and the one darting into the trees were of like provenance—hence the“joke.” Had Crowley somehow outwitted someone? The suggestion of confusionbetween Department of Justice, B.I. agents, and M.I.D. persists.VISIONSBefore Crowley left Esopus Island, he experienced further inner-planerevelations. On September 5 at 5:00 p.m. he experienced what he called theVision of Jupiter. As it is now impossible to be sure of what happened, or evenhow to interpret the experience—an experience the mystic himself could notaccount for—we have no alternative but to leave the spare account in his ownwords.The meditation of this afternoon resulted in an initiation so stupendous that Idare not hint at its Word. It is the supreme secret of a Magus, and it is soawful that I tremble even now—two hours later and more—2:20 p.m. was the time—asI write concerning it. In a single instant I had the Key to the whole of theChinese wisdom. In the light—momentary glimpse as it was—of this truth, allsystems of religion and philosophy became absolutely puerile. Even the Law [ofThelema] appears no more than a curious incident. I remain absolutelybewildered, blinded, knowing what blasting image lies in this shrine. It bafflesme to understand how my brother Magi, knowing this, ever went on.I had only one foreshadowing of this Vision of Jupiter—for so I may call it!—andthat was a samadhi which momentarily interrupted my concentration of sammasati.This can only be described vaguely by saying that I obtained a reconciliation oftwo contraries of which “There is a discrimination between good and evil” isone.This experience has shaken me utterly; it has been a terrible struggle to forcemyself to this record. The secret comes along the path of aleph to Chokmah. Icould write it plainly in a few words of one syllable, and most people would noteven notice it. But it has might to hurl every Master of the Temple into theAbyss, and to fling every adept of the Rose Cross down to the Qliphoth. Nowonder One said that the Book T was in ashes in the Urn of a Magus! I can’t seeat all how it will affect me at present. Even the Way of the Tao looksidiotic—but then of course that’s what it is! So I suppose that’s it, all right.And its freedom, in an utterly fascinating and appalling sense, is beyond myfiercest conception.21 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt577]One might only add that Jupiter is the largest planet in our system. Perhaps onemight imagine waking up one morning with the sudden realization of this monsterplanet moving inexorably closer toward us, obliterating all in a nihilisticpath, then monstrous as its annihilating darkness eneveloped our atmosphere: anultra nightmare, for sure, but Crowley does not describe his vision as such,which suggests that his vision was of the annihilation of a thought,thought-relation, or process, rather than a discomposure of the cosmos. Thedescription remains fatally fascinating, and if it did affect his futureframework of mental reference, one can only suggest that Crowley, from thispoint on, was not completely human in mind, as we might understand the term, andthat too is a nightmare to contemplate. However, the next day seems to have beenbusiness as usual, as he got down to sammasati, recalling, if that is the rightverb, a life as Sir Edward Kelley, ambitious scryer of John Dee and discoverer,or inventor, of the aethyrs that meant so much to Crowley the Magus. Accordingto his experience, Kelley was not, as he’d thought, Welsh, but Irish, his familyhaving come to Wales from Ireland on some smuggling business. Well, all theseincarnations seem like shaves off Crowley’s personality, deep interests, anddarker fantasies: components of his psychological makeup.On November 28 he recalled an incarnation before Edward Kelley, in which heperformed the Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin the Mage. This seems less than likelyhistorically, because the book is generally supposed to have been aneighteenth-century work based largely on a seventeenth-century original. Kelleywas born in 1555, though the book of magic Crowley knew by that name was falselydated to the fifteenth century, as was the Fama Fraternitatis, the foundationtext of Roisicrucianism.Marius de Aquilis was the name of his pre-Kelly incarnation, this time anItalian, proud of “my” Roman blood. Marius was in an Order akin to the Jesuits,his Holy Guardian Angel at odds with an ambitious nature, yet otherwise withoutsuspicion that “Jehovah & Co” might not be what they seemed. He did have a touchof illumination, though, connecting Jehovah with Jupiter, on account of Romanbirth. Nobility also forced him back from black magic; Marius was a“Rosicrucian,” possessing, like the fifteenth-century tomb of “ChristianRosenkreuz” (alleged founder of the Order), an ever-burning lamp and a wand, thelamp spherical, of filigree gold and probably silver, its light emanating froman incandescent center.THE BLUE EQUINOXCrowley returned to New York from Esopus Island on September 9, 1918, withoutany real sense of direction. The Amalantrah seed had fallen on stony ground withnone of the participants wishing to take on roles allotted them by the wizard,who, by the end of the Working had appeared contradictory, or else his intuitivemouthpiece had confused the message.Practically the only thing he could think of doing was to get on with a newvolume of The Equinox, the “Review of Scientific Illuminism” last seen inSeptember 1913. Crowley accounted for the five-year hiatus by saying that it wasa five-year volume of silence, to follow magically ten equinoxes of speech:nothing to do with lack of funds, apparently. The fact was that Crowley hadwritten an enormous amount since the last issue and wished to get some of it“out” as a way of extending the magical force of the Law throughout the world,for which purpose he had joined Madeleine’s hand to his blessed phallus at 11:05a.m. on September 2 in a magickal rite.In the meantime he demonstrated to Bill Seabrook on returning to Fifth Avenuewhat he meant when he told the journalist that his respite on Esopus Island hadincreased his magical power. Crowley fell into step behind a man, and at aparticular moment, fell to his haunches, at which second the man in fronttoppled to the pavement. Picking himself up he looked about him for whateverobject he felt he must have slipped on. Seabrook was reasonably impressed.Having parted from Roddie, the Beast needed somewhere new to live and found alarge single-roomed apartment studio at 1 University Place, on the corner ofWashington Square North and Waverley Place, close to the Seabrooks, TheodoreDreiser, Sinclair Lewis, Eugene O’Neill, Robert Winthrop Chanler, and LouisUmfreville Wilkinson, among many other bright stars of the village.*185[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft185] Having only one room, Crowley camouflaged thebed with a large screen he had made. This he painted with images of the threeHindu principles of Sun, Moon, and Fire. As the bed was still visible, heobtained another screen and waited for inspiration as to how to fill its threesections. Crowley’s favorite resorts at the time were the six-story BrevoortHotel on 5th Avenue and 8th Street, the Hotel Lafayette at 30 East 9th Street onthe southeast corner of University Place (a magnet for the artist-literary crowdand lovers of French cooking), and Luchow’s Restaurant, 110 East 14th Street atIrving Place, East Village—not, as it sounds, a Chinese restaurant but a broadthree-story neoclassical German restaurant founded by August “Gus” Lüchow(pronounced “Lukov”). The umlaut went in 1917 when America entered the war,causing the “Chinese” confusion. Luchow’s was popular with musicians andentertainers.†186 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft186]It was customary for Crowley to divine a word of magical guidance at eachequinox, an idea gleaned I believe from a French Masonic practice. According tothe Confessions the equinoctial word that autumn was eleven, which had magicalassociations. In retrospect, and with hindsight, Crowley noted “eleven” as theseason’s keynote, insofar as the armistice that ended World War I was signed at11:00 a.m. on November 11, the eleventh month.22 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt578]French astrologer F. C. Barlet had already informed leading MartinistVictor-Émile Michelet in July 1918 of the war’s imminent end after October andbefore the end of the year.*187 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft187]At the end of the first week in October, as the autumn leaves fell, CharlesStansfeld Jones became convinced that he’d fulfilled his “sonship” bydis-covering, as he thought, the “secret key” of The Book of the Law. This, heclaimed, was the word AL, the Semitic expression for a divinity, its number 31.The number corresponded to another key number of the book. The Greek Thelēma andAgapē (“Will” and “Love”) were 93 each; there were three chapters to the book,and three times 31 is 93: a “supernal triad” to be found at the head of the Treeof Life. Jones kept his discovery to himself until November. When at last theBeast heard of it, he appeared delighted. Here was another vindication ofJones’s sonship and the validity of Crowley’s teaching methods. Crowley revisedthis opinion several times when he observed Jones taking too much on himself andclaiming grades higher than “Master of the Temple.” He would send Jones acorrective letter on December 28, 1923.The word AL exists in the [sic] Book of the Law, you [Jones] did not “produce”it and I did not receive it from you. It was pointed out to me by you which is atotally different matter. The writer [presumably Jones] asserts that I haveproclaimed AL to be the Key of the Work but this is not the case. So far as Iattach any meaning to the phrase “the Key of the Work” the Word would beAbrahadabra, a word which I “produced” myself by a train of Qabalistic reasoningin Mexico City in 1900 e.v. [era vulgari = “vulgar,” or “common,” era]. That Iproduced the Word and Aiwass “accepted” it gives me no claim to be superior toAiwass. On the contrary, I am profoundly honoured that he deigned to confirm myresearch by adopting it in the Book of the Law. See Chapter 1, verse 20, whereit is called the Key of the Rituals.. . . The Word AL is one of the three combinations which make up the Number ofthe Word of the Law. It is nowhere indicated in the Book that the discoverer ofthe “Key of it all” (one of the 4 Keys, incidentally) is entitled to any gradesoever as such.It is true, by the way, that there is a certain intimate connection between whatthe writing of the letter calls my higher self and Aiwass, but this does notclash with the vitally important fact that he is an independent intelligencewhether incarnate or no. I look to him alone for my instructions.23[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt579]In the meantime Crowley had more mundane business to see to. Summoned back toAttorney General Becker’s office on Park Avenue on October 11, Crowley spoke toBecker himself. A “delightful evening” was passed, as Crowley related, tellingthe attorney general about his time in the Staatsburg–Hyde Park district.Crowley’s account suggests that there had indeed been confusion and overlapbetween the Justice Department’s B.I. agents and M.I.D. officers, thoughBecker’s account indicates only that he asked Crowley about “Germanpropaganda.”24 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt580] This limitation seems a littleunlikely given the flap around Crowley and Madeleine George. One might presumethat was just one of the subjects discussed. Crowley informed Becker aboutO.T.O. outer head Theodor Reuss’s January 22, 1917, “Anational Manifesto,” whichhad so upset South African members and about which Windram had written toCrowley and Jones. Crowley said it was likely that Reuss was a well-connectedPrussian spy and had probably visited the United States during the war, of whichhe had informed the Bureau previously.25 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt281] Crowleyinsisted Reuss’s circular constituted German propaganda.26[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt282] At the Sixty-sixth Congress U.S. SenateSubcommittee on the Judiciary, concerned with brewing and liquor interests andGerman Bolshevik propaganda, Becker testified that while “Aleister Crowley andhis organization may be classified as a dubious proposition,” Crowley had notbeen a German tool, and his group was a “pacifist affair.”27[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt583]Bureau of Investigation agent Frank O’Donnell summarized the October 11, 1918,examination in his report on Crowley’s alleged “Radical Activities,” submittedJuly 30, 1919.Under questioning, Crowley stated that his full name is Aleister St. EdwardCrowley; that he was born in Leamington, Warwickshire, England; that he is stilla British Subject; never having sworn allegiance to any other country. He statedthat by occupation he is an author, having written about forty books of poetryand a large number of treatises on mysticism and kindred subjects and that hehas from time to time contributed to various newspapers and periodicals on anumber of subjects. He stated that he had always resided in England up to thebeginning of November, 1914 when he came to this country aboard the [actuallyRMS] Lusitania. He had had two addresses, one in London and one in Scotland butthat the war had broken up his business as a result of which he stored hisfurniture and stock of books and came to this country. When he came he hadintended remaining only a fortnight but that the original business deal whichwas the primary cause of his coming here had broken down and he had thereforestarted out to make a new career in this country. After detailing certaininformation concerning his business connections, bank accounts and agencyrepresentatives in England, Crowley stated that finding himself in financialdifficulty here he had been able to keep afloat by selling certain articles ofvalue which he had brought over with him and had then obtained employment on thestaff of the publication known as Vanity Fair, writing at the same time forother magazines. Coming to the point of his financial and banking connections inthis country, Crowley, however, admitted opening an account at the HarrimanNational Bank, this city, which he maintained only a short time. He afterwardsopened an account at the 5th Avenue Bank. He was compelled to close this accountby reason of what he terms certain trouble had with the bank through thefoolishness of a man named Stewart [“Stuart X”; Henry Clifford Stuart] down inWashington. The reason for the bank requesting him to withdraw his account,Crowley stated, was to be found in the following incident. He had arranged intoan arrangement with Stewart [sic] to advertise a book for him and Stewart hadgiven the address of the bank, to which replies to the advertisement could beaddressed. The bank people became annoyed at the large amount of mail resultingfrom this arrangement and decided not to be bothered with him. From that timeuntil August 6th this year (1918) Crowley stated he had had no bank account. Onthe last named date he opened an account with the Title Guarantee and TrustCompany under the name of Ordo Templi Orientis which is a fraternal organizationand in which Crowley is interested. Crowley states that the order is a very oldone and that he is Grandmaster of same, having been connected with it for thepast seven or eight years. He states the order, while existing in various partsof the British Empire has been held in abeyance on account of war conditions andthat he has just organized a branch in this country. He states the funds of theorganization deposited with the Title Guarantee and Trust Company are theproceeds of the sale of property of his in Scotland. He states while the fundsare really the property of the order, he has a right to draw on them for theorganization’s purposes and that he feels responsible for them. The funds, hesaid, were transmitted from England through the New York law firm of Lord, Dayand Lord, they being correspondents of Subject’s lawyer in Scotland. Sinceresiding in this country, Crowley has made his abode at different times at thefollowing addresses:The Hotel St. Regis, Hotel Wolcott, 40 West 36th Street, after which he moved toNew Rochelle and then to Philadelphia, returning to this state he took anapartment on West 57th Street above the Alps Restaurant, leaving here he spentseveral months in California, followed by trips through Canada to Seattle, SanFrancisco and back to New York, when in January 1916 he took an apartment nextdoor to the Harvard Club in this city. He next lived in an apartment on Broadwayabout 52nd Street and upon vacating which he spent several months in NewHampshire in the Adams Cottage, which was maintained by Evangeline Adams, theastrologer, returning again to New York he remained for two or three weeks at115 East 26th Street, whereupon he went to New Orleans and resided for thewinter at 3402 or 3403 Delphine Street, directly opposite the Delphine Theatre.After this he spent some time with cousins by the name of Bishop in Titusville,Florida, after which he returned again to New York, on this occasion moving intoa studio conducted by a man named Leon Engers Kennedy, on 5th Avenue, the numberof which he does not recall. About this time he became associated with thepublication known as the International. Up to the past summer, he had resided at64 West 9th Street. During the past sum-mer he lived on Esopus Island on theHudson. During his stay at the last named address, he was visited by thefollowing: Rowdie [sic] Minor, 134 West 15th Street; Mr Stansfield [sic] Jones,136 West 11th Street and a Mrs. Madeline [sic] George, formerly of the hotelsSeymour and Biltmore. At this time (October 1918) Crowley stated that he wasnegotiating with the Universal Book Stores at Detroit, Michigan, trying toarrange a contract with them by which they would take over his stock of booksand certain future publications for sale in this country. He stated that he wassupporting himself principally through the funds of the Ordo Templi Orientis,previously referred to, to which he feels he is entitled, inasmuch as he waspersonally responsible for having supplied about nine tenths of the total amountof the money on deposit.Questioned further about the order he stated that it was just like masonry andhe admitted at the actual head of it was a German, Theodore [sic, should beTheodor] Reuss by name, whom he always thought might have some considerableofficial position in Germany. This man, he stated, had left England with theGerman Ambassador, since which time he had been in various places and at thepresent time (October 1918) he was alleged to be running the Continental Times,an American newspaper, in Berlin and was also running a branch of the OrdoTempli Orientis under another name in Switzerland, issuing manifestos which werepacifistic in tone. He admitted that the lodge of the order in England had beenraided and that the nominal head of same, a woman, who called herself a psychichad been arrested as a fortune-teller. He stated no formal charges had been madedirectly against the order but that he had reason to believe that the peoplebehind the raid, misunderstanding the motives of his association here withGeorge Sylvester Veirick [sic] thought that in that way they could annoy him andbreak up the organization. Asked again if he knew where Theodor Reuss might beat the present time he stated that he had been told by Mr Haynes [sic, should beRaynes] of the Literary Digest [published on 4th Ave.] that Reuss had come tothe Bronx, although he did not believe there was any foundation to the rumor,however he had reported the information, he said to this Department. Crowleyadmitted that he was very well acquainted with Reuss and that since hisdeparture with the German Ambassador from London he had been corresponding withhim. Reuss, he said, was an out and out German and he did not think he wouldhesitate a moment to use the order for the purpose of disseminating Germanpropaganda if the opportunity offered itself to do so. Crowley then describedhis endeavors to become associated with the British Secret Service, detailinghis dealings with Commodore Gaunt of the British Intelligence Office butadmitted that he had never succeeded in obtaining any official recognition.Crowley denied that there was any action pending against him in London thatwould prevent him from returning to England at any time he wished. Upon askingwho was associated with him in developing the Ordo Templi Orientis in thiscountry, Crowley gave the names of Mr. Jones and Mr. Kennedy, previouslyreferred to and added the name of Mrs. Waddell of 97 Elliott Avenue, Yonkers.Mr. Jones, he said, was at one time Treasurer of the order but had resigned thisoffice.In conclusion Crowley stated that in negotiating with the Universal Book Storesin Detroit, he was dealing with a Mr. Ryerson and stated that a Mr. Gibson issecretary and treasurer of the Company. Messrs. Lord, Day and Lord, he statedwere still his attorneys. Investigation will be continued.28[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt584]In October, the means to publish Crowley’s planned Equinox, volume 3,issue 1—the famous, and highly controversial “Blue Equinox”—arrived in Gotham.The instrument was Ancient & Accepted Rite Freemason 32nd-degree Albert WinslowRyerson (1872–1931), referred to above, general manager of the Universal BookStores, Detroit. Ryerson was accompanying his treasurer William Gibson (alsomentioned in O’Donnell’s report) on a book-buying jaunt down the East Coast’sbiggest cities. Being occult literature aficionados, they tried to locateAleister Crowley. Visiting one of his past addresses, they were told that he’dgone and were left clue-less until a janitor spoke up to say that Crowley couldsometimes be found at the Brevoort Hotel on 5th Avenue. Leaving a note there,they were contacted two days later by C. S. Jones. Jones screened theireligibility to meet the man they sought. Ryerson would later testify that thecloak-and-dagger stuff was necessary becauseMr. Crowley was the accredited agent of the British Government in the employ oftheir Secret Service Department. That was one of the reasons why it was alwaysso difficult to get in touch with him. German spies were continually after him,and he would never allow anyone to see him, unless he first knew who theywere.29 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt585]Crowley says in his Confessions that his latest ritual work had somehow come tothe attention of the “Supreme Grand Council of the Scottish Rite in the Valleyof Detroit, Michigan.” His account was that the council had deputed two princesof the Royal Secret (32nd degree) to interview him. Unimpressed by their rank,Crowley informed them he could only discuss O.T.O. matters with sovereign grandinspectors general (33rd-degree A&A Masons). What they could discuss, however,was his new issue of The Equinox. After three meetings, Ryerson did agree toaccept a shipment of Crowley’s rare books from England. Thus, Crowley hoped toresolve the outstanding business he had hoped to settle with John Quinn inDecember 1914. Ryerson then also agreed to market The Equinox. That apparentlysettled, Crowley contacted New York’s DeVinne Press to print the vaunted work.And then, on Monday, November 11, 1918, a headline appeared in the New YorkTribune.GERMANY HAS SURRENDEREDWORLD WAR ENDED AT 6 A.M."},{"pageContent":"PART THREE> ESCAPE"},{"pageContent":"THIRTY-THREEimage [images/9781620556313_099.jpg]Genius RowPainfully aware that he had still not written the promised “comment” on The Bookof the Law, the Beast decided that a change of air might help. On November 12 hewrote to “sailor boy” Cecil Frederick Russell to say that he was going down toAtlantic City, New Jersey, and could, if Russell would care to take a day offand “run over” (presumably from Annapolis in Maryland) to see him, be found atthe grand six-story Hotel Alamac right on the oceanfront, run very politely andefficiently by popular Rotarian Harry Latz.1 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt586] Inthe event, Russell couldn’t make it, and Crowley found no inspiration for his“Comment.” What he did find, however, was a new friend.Nineteen-year-old African American Helen Ruth Hollis was born on August 10,1899, in Centreville, Maryland, to James Hollis, teamster and ice-plant worker,and wife, Adeline (née Taylor) Hollis. One of ten children, Helen left schoolafter seventh grade and by 1920 was a boarding domestic “working out” inAtlantic City, New Jersey.*188 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft188]It is highly likely that she and Crowley met during his first visit to AtlanticCity in November 1918. She appears in early censuses with her family, and in the1920 census twice, first in Atlantic City on January 2, 1920, as a lodgeremployed as a servant to a private family, and again on January 16 with herparents in Centreville, Maryland. By 1927 she was living in Philadelphia; a newsitem in the Baltimore Afro-American for September 24, 1927, reported that MissHelen R. Hollis of Philadelphia visited her mother Adeline in Centreville. Shemay have been visiting to introduce her fiancé or husband as she married CecilWatkins, a “chauffeur” for a grocery store, in or around 1927; he appears in the1930 Baltimore census with his Maryland-born wife of three years, Helen, whoadjusted her age to indicate a 1905–1906 birth. This is consistent with herentry in the 1940 census, where she appears in a Philadelphia boarding-house asa widowed domestic to a private home. Her 1949 Social Security SS-5 applicationgave her birth year as 1905. Helen died in Philadelphia on July 28, 1989, agedeighty-nine; her Social Security Death Index entry gives her correct birth yearas 1899.*189 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft189]2 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt587]Young Helen undoubtedly took Crowley’s fancy and she would weave in and out ofhis Greenwich Village apartment in 1919.Shortly before Christmas 1918, Crowley received a reply to an invitation he hadsent to John Quinn. The great man was now Jeanne Robert Foster’s discreet lover.While Jeanne still occupied her apartment at 300 West 49th Street, with husbandMatlack continuing to live with Jeanne’s parents in Schenectady, Jeanne stayeddeeply loyal to Quinn, joining him on European tours until his death in 1924. Tothe end of her days, the memory of Quinn was sacred to her; she hoped she mightbe reincarnated as part of a “group” including him, and their souls could lovein the flesh once more. Judging by the following letter, there were clearly nohard feelings toward Crowley on John Quinn’s part, despite W. B. Yeats’spersistent efforts to blacken Crowley in his patron’s mind.December 20, 1918My dear Crowley,I received yours of December 17th.Thanks for your wishes about my health.I am getting along well, I hope, but I am going out very little and declininginvitations generally.I am leaving on Sunday, for a week or ten days, for Illionois, to visit a dearold Uncle of mine, seventy-six years of age, a Catholic Priest out there, whom Iam very fond of.Perhaps some time later in the winter it might be possible for me to have a lookat your pictures.Trusting the New Year will be a satisfactory one,I amSincerely yours,John Quinn3 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt588]4319 Spring [Greenwich Village phone exchange; date: about April 1919].My dear Quinn,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.I have now got my pictures more or less ready to show you—any day will suit meas long as I know beforehand.Love is the law, love under will.Aleister Crowley4 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt589]The above letters indicate clearly one of Crowley’s greatest postwar interests:becoming a painter. His artistic odyssey kicked off properly in early 1919 inthe encouraging atmosphere of Greenwich Village. One wonders if Crowley did notfeel competitive with Leon Engers Kennedy at this time; announcements abouttheir paintings closely coincide. The Atlanta Constitution reviewed Engers’sPsychochromes on January 5: “Have You Had Your Soul Painted Yet? The NewestAfter-the-War Art and Its Astonishing Translations of Life.”Quinn was of course the astute collector, connoisseur, and patron of modern art,so it is a shame that we do not know what he thought of Crowley’s paintings,though one suspects it would have been hard for him to surmount his prejudicegiven his expressed denigration (to W. B. Yeats at least) of Crowley as a minorpoet (whose work he had nonetheless shelled out $500 for). It was big of Crowleyto make an overture to Quinn again in view of Quinn’s unwillingness to help withCrowley’s 1917 affidavit and, if Crowley knew, Quinn’s great love for JeanneFoster, who seemed at last to have found her ideal object of devotion, despitemarriage to Matlack, Quinn’s age, declining health, and impotence; Quinn wouldundergo an operation for cancer in February 1919.image [images/9781620556313_074.jpg]Fig. 33.1. Photo taken in Paris, 1923, by Jeanne Robert Foster; left to right:Erik Satie (composer); John Quinn; Constantin Brancusi (sculptor); Henri-PierreRoché (art collector, dealer of avant garde art; author of Jules et Jim, 1952)On January 2, 1919, Crowley wrote to Russell at his lodgings at 33rd Street and7th Avenue near Penn Street station (now Muhammad Ali Way). Crowley seemed keento teach Russell, but precisely what is unclear.You certainly have the most extraordinary ability to get the meaning of what youread. I think the epitome you give is admirable. The question now arises, whatabout the practical side of all this?I should like to see you Friday or Saturday for lunch. The Brevoort seems to behaving labor troubles, but we could walk up to Luchow’s. Will you ring me up assoon as you get this, and let me know whether either of these days suit?5[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt590]Ensconced in his apartment at 1 University Place, Crowley probably consideredhis casual romance of the time centered on Helen Hollis, to whose family home inCenterville, Maryland (across the Chester River, east of Annapolis), he wrote onJanuary 6: “I was so glad to get your letter this morning . . . perhaps you willbe in these parts before very long.”6 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt591]He probably thought of getting Helen to sit for him as he had paint on thebrain. In the event, Crowley’s romantic life took an entirely unexpected swing,and with it, his art. Within days of writing to Helen Hollis, Marianne (orMarian) Hirsig turned up at his apartment with younger sister, Leah, then livingat a five-story apartment at 1199 Boston Road, on the corner of East 168thStreet (still standing), between Harlem and West Bronx. The Hirsigs’ ostensiblereason for coming was to seek advice about accommodation as Leah wanted to quither job as music teacher at Public School No. 40 for a law course at New YorkUniversity. Again, Crowley found Leah intriguing and began to remove her clothesas Leah warmed to him like a cat by the fire. Before they left, Crowleysuggested that Leah pose for him or even join him at University Place as alodger if all else failed.To Crowley’s surprise, Leah turned up on January 11 and sat for him. He tried apencil sketch of her nude but found the apparent simplicity of the human form anear impossible challenge. However, after having cast his sketch aside, lookingat it again later but turned horizontal, he seized on another possibility, andputting two and three together got hold of his unpainted “bedroom” screen andconceived a triptych with an image of Leah, distorted as a “Dead Soul”surrounded by other “dead souls” and images inspired by Robert WinthropChanler’s screens and Leah’s expressed wish to be painted as a “dead soul.” Inthe process of painting, Crowley found himself cohabiting with the lady he wouldcall the “Ape of Thoth,” or Hermetic mouthpiece.Chandler [sic] came again and again to gaze and gloat. He brought everyone heknew to look at it. And even artists famous for their classical refinement hadto admit its grisly power. In short, the dead souls conquered the city and theirQueen their creator. She came like Balchis to Solomon, bringing gifts, anendless caravan of fascinations. Innumerable elephants groaning under thetreasury of virtues, while in her own slim-fingered hands, she brought herheart. Before her coming the concubines covered their faces and fled. We foundalmost at once a splendid studio on the south side of Washington Square, a longand lofty room with three wide windows, looking out across the tree tops to theopening of Fifth Avenue.7 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt592]Crowley now felt his desert journey was close to its conclusion, and he began tofeel very good indeed. We know this because more than twenty years later, whenabout to set off on an August holiday from London to Cornwall, he relished the“really delightful day, . . . exactly in quality to the days of Lea inWashington Square, New York City.”8 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt593]image [images/9781620556313_075.jpg]Fig. 33.2. “Genius Row,” Washington Square. Crowley’s 2nd floor apartment (no.63) is lower left of the large studio window at no. 62 (center). (photo courtesyNew York University)The Beast and Ape of Thoth’s new home at 63 Washington Square South was perfect.Situated on the opposite side of the opening of 5th Avenue, between what is nowLaGuardia Place—formerly South 5th Avenue, then by 1918, West Broadway—andThompson Street, opposite New York University, No. 63 and its neighbors to rightand left were known affectionately as “Genius Row,” before being crudelydemolished in 1948.*190 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft190]image [images/9781620556313_076.jpg]Fig. 33.3. Another view of Genius Row; Crowley’s apartment at No. 63 obscured bytree (center)image [images/9781620556313_077.jpg]Fig. 33.4. Genius Row from Washington Square Park. Crowley’s apartment is justcut off, left of left frame.Two doors to the right from Crowley’s second-floor studio at No. 63, No. 61 wasknown as the House of Genius. Banker James Speyer leased the property in 1886 toSwiss-born Madame Katherine Reude Blanchard. She converted the family dwellinginto a boardinghouse for writers, artists, and musicians. Residents includedwriter of short stories with twisted endings “O. Henry” (William Sydney Porter);Eugene O’Neill, playwright of the comedy Ah, Wilderness! Stephen Crane, authorof The Red Badge of Courage; and novelist Frank Norris. Other distinguishedresidents included Willa Cather, John Dos Passos, and poet Alan Seeger, who diedfighting with the French Foreign Legion at the Battle of the Somme in 1916.Next door, bohemian painter Ellen Emmett (later Ellen Emmett Rand) had enjoyed afourth-floor apartment and ground-floor studio at 62 Washington Square Southfrom 1902 until at least 1909. Her abode featured in the January 19, 1908, NewYork Times society column under the headline COSTUME CARNIVAL IN ARTIST’SSTUDIO, where we learn that Ellen’s “old-fashioned house was given over to therevelers, and, on the top floor, the spacious studio, lighted with wax candles,was the mecca of the gay throng. . . . John Alsop, who resembles Clyde Fitch,was dressed as a Morrocan sheik.” The event attracted more than 150 art-mindedNew Yorkers. Famous as a portrait painter, Ellen Emmett gave the world portraitsof President Franklin Roosevelt and wife, Eleanor.Moving back to No. 63, sculptor Augustus Saint Gaudens (1848–1907) held chamberconcerts in his studio there during the 1880s. English critic and writer EdmundGosse (1849–1928) met artist of the American Renaissance Kenyon Cox (1883–1919)at one such concert in November 1884. Crowley was familiar with Edmund Gosse’sautobiographical Father and Son (1907), because Gosse’s parents, like Crowley’s,were committed Plymouth brethren, and Gosse, like Crowley, rebelled against hisfather’s religion. Gosse’s confessional work stimulated Crowley’spart-autobiographical The World’s Tragedy (1910).In 1919, Crowley probably shared No. 63 with Australian modernist Cubist painterFrank Arthur Nankivell (1869–1959). Between 1915 and 1920, Nankivell painted anItalian Parade in Washington Square, probably as seen from the studio Nankivellrented during this period. Remembered today for printing etchings by Arthur B.Davies and Childe Hassam, Nankivell was closely involved in 1913’s breakthroughArmory Show, which Quinn patronized and which opened Jeanne Foster’s aesthetichorizons.image [images/9781620556313_078.jpg]Fig. 33.5. Robert Winthrop Chanler (photo by W. C. Ward, ca. 1913)A member of the Association of American Painters and Sculptors, Nankivell servedon the Armory Show’s Committee on Domestic Exhibits, an experience that led himto adopt the modernist aesthetic, something Crowley himself easily accommodated,though without forsaking representational elements. Another contemporary painterworking at No. 63, from 1919 to 1927, was illustrator and teacher RobertWesley Amick (1879–1969).Crowley’s visitor and friend artist Robert Winthrop Chanler (1872–1930), who in1911 had leased the double house at 147 East 19th Street that would be his homeuntil he died, was extremely well connected socially, not only on his own behalf(being related to the Stuyvesant, Livingston, Astor, and Dudley-Winthropfamilies) but also in his range of patrons and associates.In 1918, Chanler had made stunning stained glass for the studio of close friendmultimillionaire sculptor and philanthropist Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney(1874–1942), based in the village at 19 Macdougal Alley and West Eighth Street,which studio would house her exhibition of World War I sculpture in November1919 (Gertrude’s brother Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt had died in the Lusitaniaatrocity of 1915). Chanler had already made stunning panels and murals forGertrude’s studio and private rooms at her estate at Old Westbury, New York, in1914. Whitney and Chanler were both wild in imagination, serious in essentialintent, and socially nonconformist.image [images/9781620556313_079.jpg]Fig. 33.6. Aleister Crowley, by Robert Winthrop Chanler, 1919. (image courtesyof Ordo Templi Orientis)Chanler certainly had the depth of imagination, joy in life, and breadth ofintelligence to value an outsider on the scale of Aleister Crowley, as isevident in Chanler’s portrait of Crowley, presented as pure presence, smartlyindifferent to the world. Ivan Narodny, who was Chanler’s secretary and wrote abook about Chanler, also became Crowley’s friendly acquaintance. Heavilyinfluenced by Chanler, Crowley borrowed several motifs from him, includingexotic birds, mythological creatures fantastically colored, symbols amid flowingtropicana reminiscent of Gauguin. Chanler’s creation of a complete aestheticenvironment for Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney’s Macdougal Alley Studio in 1918 wasparalleled in 1920–1921 by Crowley’s decorating his “Abbey of Thelema” residenceat Cefalù in floor-to-ceiling visual fantasy and allegory.It can hardly have been coincidence that made Crowley paint his first triptychscreen with Hindu images of the elements when Chanler that same year hadexecuted heavenly, planetary themes in a dynamic screen for Gertrude Whitney,variously called Firmament, Astrology Screen, and Dance of the Planets showingSaturn, Jupiter, Earth, shooting stars, and constellations.Chanler understood that the first “studio” was the cave of the primitivemagician and that art directly related to cult and to spiritual powers ofimagination: magic. And not all of the inspiration was one way. According toAvis Berman’s fascinating account of Chanler’s work on Whitney’s GreenwichVillage Studio, “After traveling around the country, he [Crowley] moved to NewYork in 1918 [sic], where he joined the revels on East 19th Street. Betweenheroin and alcohol and ‘sex magick’ practices he demanded from both sexes,Crowley was even more of a libertine than Chanler, but his controversialpresence may have been a perverse source of inspiration for the mildlydiabolical nature of the Medusa window [in Whitney’s studio].”9[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt594]Crowley set to paint in earnest, but also in good humor. He famously placed thefollowing advertisement in a New York daily.WANTEDDwarfs, Hunchbacks, Tattooed Women, Harrison Fisher Girls, Freaks of All Sorts,Coloured Women, only if exceptionally ugly or deformed, to pose for artist.Apply by letter with photograph. Box 707.Readers may note the sly reference to “Harrison Fisher Girls” among theintentional deformity and excess. Famed for beauty and liveliness, Jeanne Fosterhad been a popular Harrison Fisher Girl.Something of a friendly competition had emerged between Crowley and Engers, andEngers, thanks to Crowley perhaps, got in first, not only with the AtlantaConstitution mentioned above but also in the New York Tribune, which printed thefollowing in their art section “Random Impressions in Current Exhibitions” onSunday, February 16.Mr. Leon Engers Kennedy is exhibiting a group of Psychochromes at the Paint BoxGalleries, Washington Square South. Mr Kennedy explains that “Psychochrome”translated means “soul colour,” and “the eye of the soul directs the hand of thecraftsman.”10 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt595]But Crowley came back strongly with a fascinating interview for the SyracuseHerald, published with illustrations on March 9, 1919. Curiously, a heavilyabridged version of the interview had appeared in the New York Evening Worldearlier, on February 26, under the headline Crowley the Village Artist. TheSyracuse Herald story had more meat and less sarcasm.image [images/9781620556313_080.jpg]Fig. 33.7. Crowley the artist, The New York World, February 26, 1919ARTIST PAINTS DEAD SOULS BUT REFUSES TO BE CLASSED WITH FUTURISTS’ SCHOOLEnglishman Portrays Weird Spirits at His Studio in Greenwich Village.Doesn’t Wear His Hair Long and He’s Not Poor Like Many Artists Are.A new artist has drifted into Greenwich Village.His name is Aleister Crowley. He doesn’t look at all like the average villageartist, having more of the snappy appearance of a Wall Street broker. His hair,instead of being worn with Bolshevik abandon, is close cropped. Instead ofshaving once every three months he shaves every day. His clothes are neat butnot gaudy and have the close-fitting and knobby lines of a fashionable tailor.His shoes are not out at toe or down at heel. Those he had on yesterday were lowcut and obviously made to order. They looked well under pale, opalescent sockswith black clocks.Mr. Crowley’s studio, on the third floor of No. 63 Washington Square, South, isfar removed from the den of the average village artist of the well known“struggling” type. It is luxuriously fitted with cavernous easy chairs, mahoganydavenports, expensive tapestries, a fine rug or two, an expensive andmany-pillowed divan, with here and there a rare rosewood antique.Riot Of Untamed ColorsSet in the west wall is an old-fashioned fireplace, while close by is a mahoganytea wagon with a half-filled bottle of rare cognac and a silver box of importedcigarettes. One enormous window, nearly twenty feet wide, looks acrossWashington Park and directly up Fifth Avenue.The walls of this studio are covered with the wildest maelstrom of untamed andunrelated colors ever confined under one roof. They look like a collisionbetween a Scandinavian sunset and a paint-as-you-please exhibit of theIndependent Artists association.The effect is riotous, blinding—but not distressing, after one gets used to it.Mr. Crowley helps one to do that, with a dash of cognac, an imported cigarette,and a delightful personality.On entering the studio one is apt to be taken with a severe attack of the blindstaggers, the chromatic camouflage is so overwhelmingly brilliant. But after onehas been there for a short time one is in no hurry to leave.Came from EnglandMr. Crowley is an Englishman who at the outbreak of the Great War was in theconfidential service of the British government. In this service he was shot inthe leg he says. He then came to this country, late in 1915 on a special missionfor the British and later became editor of the International, a radicalmagazine, published in Greenwich Village.“I had been engaged in various literary pursuits all my life,” said Mr. Crowleyas he held a small glass of cognac up to the light.“I have written forty books of poetry, among other things. There are some of myworks on those shelves.” He pointed to several rows of books over the fireplace.“But, somehow, I couldn’t attain the desired expression in either prose orpoetry. I chafed under the restraint of the pen.“However, I probably would never have taken up painting if it hadn’t been forthe International, of which I became editor. I couldn’t find artists who woulddraw the covers I wanted, so finally, I became disgusted about fifteen monthsago and decided to draw my own covers.*191 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft191]“I had never studied art and had never drawn or painted a picture in my life.When I tried to draw those covers I became so interested in the work that I gaveup the editorship of the magazine and went in for art. What you see around youis the result. What sort of artist am I. Oh I don’t know just what to callmyself. I’d say off-hand that I was an old master because I’m a painter mostlyof dead souls.Not a Cubist“My art? Well, I don’t know just what you’d call it. But please, whatever youdo, don’t call me a cubist or a futurist or anything queer like that. I guessyou might call me a subconscious impressionist, or something on that order. Myart really is subconscious and automatic.“I’ll tell you why. When I found I couldn’t paint a portrait I didn’t decide togo abroad and study for thirty or forty years.“Instead, I walked up to a blank canvas one day and, standing very close to it,I placed the wet brush upon it and closed my eyes. I had no preconceived idea ofwhat I was going to paint. My hand simply moved automatically over the canvas.“I don’t know how long I worked in that subconscious way, but you can imagine myastonishment when I found that I had painted a likeness of a friend whom I hadnot seen in many years. It was that person’s dead soul I had painted. I have itabout the studio somewhere.“All my work is done that way. I never know or have a preconceived idea of whatis to appear on the canvas. My hand wanders into the realm of dead souls andvery frequently the result is the likeness of some living person.”image [images/9781620556313_081.jpg]Fig. 33.8.

It is done in watercolor. It is entitled The Burmese Lady. If you will look at it closely you willdiscover that it is none other than our old friend Bennett.”The painting indicated by Mr. Crowley did resemble Arnold Bennett as he mightlook if he blackened his face and donned a Hottentot’s wig.“Now over there you see a weird looking lady with something resembling a pig.The title of that is Ella Wheeler Wilcox and the Swami. One of my best works,that.“Of course, my impressions are not always those of well known people. That oneover there on the east wall isn’t a bad thing. That girl’s head. It is entitledYoung Bolshevik Girl with Wart Looking at Trotzky.“That one with all the little figures? Oh, the name of that is A Day Dream ofDead Hats. You see, it shows a lady asleep on a veranda while the spirits ofbygone bonnets pass across a mystic bridge on the heads of a dozen undressedladies. You’ll probably admit that most women when they take a nap dream of deadbonnets.“The painting of the colored girl in the rear of the studio is something I didin rather a hurry. It is called Is That the Face That Launched a Thousand Ships.That one called the Witches’ Sabbath, with all the little features in it isinteresting.Little Eva, Too“That fluffy one dancing on one toe is supposed to be the dead spirit of EvaTanguay.”One of his pictures which Mr. Crowley likes best is that of Madame Yorska, theFrench actress. It shows the face of a woman, thrown backward in death, abejewelled dagger thrust into her throat.“I got that impression at some affair given in Greenwich Village. Mme. Yorskawas there. The violinist, in rendering one striking piece, asked that the lightsbe turned low. While he was playing I saw Mme. Yorska throw her head back andclose her eyes. I carried the impression of that long white throat home with me.I tried to sleep but I couldn’t. During the night I got up and going to thecanvas closed my eyes and that picture was the result.”“How about the dagger in the throat?” the artist was asked. A “GOOD EFFECT.”“Oh, that long sweeping white line of throat had to be cut somewhere and Icouldn’t think of any better way to cut a throat than with a dagger. So I stuckthe knife into it. Rather good effect, I think.“That large three-paneled screen is called the Screen of the Dead Souls. Allthose figures you see on it are dead souls in various stages of decomposition.That central figure in the middle panel is the queen of the dead souls. Ofcourse you recognize the head looking over her shoulder. That’s Hearst. Over herother shoulder is Oscar Wilde. I don’t know how he got in there, because Ireally hate him. The parrot sitting on the head of the dead lady’s soul in thethird panel is one that belongs to Bob Chanler.“The screen is a fair example of my subconscious art. It was done like thepictures, with no preconceived idea.“Study art? Never have and never intend to.”Eventually, the “Greenwich Village Liberal Club” on MacDougal Street, with afloor above its restaurant opened as exhibition space, exhibited Crowley’spaintings until the scandal of The Equinox first began to hit in March and April1919. Despite the anarchist credentials of couple Polly Holladay and HippolyteHavel, who ran the restaurant and club space, such was the storm of protestwhipped up by Christian ladies of the club when they realized that Crowleyexpected his religion of Thelema to replace Christianity that the exhibition wasclosed: a fitting tribute to a survivor of the Decadent movement (English importversion). The picture that caused the cataclysm was displayed at the club andwas also featured in Crowley’s latest perplexing periodical The Equinox,unfortunately, in the light of the exhibition, with an interpretation of acertain “hag” with dyed and bloody hair hanging from a tree while shepherd andnymph danced, a knowing satyr smiled, and an Amanita muscaria hallucinogenicmushroom popped out of the earth to greet the revel, as they traditionally doafter a storm: the French word for such post-tempest growths being le Bot,nickname for the Devil. True to form, Crowley brooked no compromise onessentials. The “hag” was Christianity, and while her stringing up was a causefor joy in Crowleyland, it was not so in the United States of America.THELEMA IN DETROITCharles Stansfeld Jones, having for the time being recovered his equilibrium,made for Detroit to work in Ryerson’s Universal Book Stores and to establish theO.T.O. in the city through measured Monday-night lectures at the bookstore andat Theosophical meetings, billing himself as “Frater Arctaeon.” Not everyonegets to be named by an otherworldly wizard.The night before commencing work at the bookstore, Jones addressed a smallgathering at the offices of Most Worshipful and Illustrious Brother Frank T.Lodge, 33rd degree. Worshipful Brother Lodge led a group of esoterically mindedFreemasons who eagerly anticipated that all manner of secrets were about to beshared with them, encapsulated for the cognoscenti in the strikingly blue,embossed cover of The Equinox, volume 3, no 1. The “Universal Publishing Companyof Detroit” took printed and bound copies from New York’s DeVinne Press on March21, and their ad appeared in the May 10, 1919, issue of Publisher’s Weekly.image [images/9781620556313_085.jpg]Fig. 33.12.

The first was Engers Kennedy’s portrait ofCrowley’s full-body profile making a mystical gesture “in His holy meditation,”attributed to Frater T.A.T.K.T.A. The second was the aforementioned Crowleycartoon “May Morn.” I don’t say cartoon in the sense of a sketch by da Vinci butin the Disney sense, in that the technically naive image encapsulates theessence of an animated picture in its own world of symbolic representations.Having crossed the visual rubicon, the reader is addressed by one of Crowley’sbest poems, “Hymn to Pan,” composed in Russia in 1913. Crowley regarded it asthe most powerful enchantment ever written. It works, anyhow, through itsgathering pagan, rhythmic, incantatory force.Give me the sign of the Open Eye,And the token erect of thorny thigh,And the word of madness and mystery,O Pan! Io Pan!Io Pan! Io Pan Pan! Pan Pan! Pan,I am a man:Do as thou wilt, as a great god can,O Pan! Io Pan!Io Pan! Io Pan Pan! I am awakeIn the grip of the snake.And so on, but not for too long: an echo of an ideal scene in Crowley’sclassically infused imagination—and a long way lyrically from the burgeoningragtime-to-jazz movement beginning to sweep America with its own Panic, bluesybeats.Just time for a quick “editorial” before moving into the incessant meat of thebook, with its paean to the successful magical career of Charles StansfeldJones, model of devotion soon to go to Jones’s perhaps over-inspired head.THE WORLD NEEDS RELIGION. Religion must represent Truth, and celebrate it. Thistruth is of two orders: one, concerning Nature external to Man; two, concerningNature internal to Man. Existing religions, especially Christianity, are basedon primitive ignorance of the facts, particularly of external Nature.Celebrations must conform to the custom and nature of the people. Christianityhas destroyed the joyful celebrations, characterised by music, dancing,feasting, and making love, and has kept only the melancholy.So writes Crowley as if a town fixated on rodeo, Roscoe Arbuckle, Mabel Normand,Norma Talmadge, Charlie Chaplin, with Sunday’s hellfire preachin’ from the localBaptist minister good n’ true—and for whom the ideal of art was embodied inNorman Rockwell—was about to turn over to Attic philosophy and country ritualsof ancient Anatolia, with feasts for wine, Bacchanals, seasonal copulations, andoracular priestesses. “The World needs religion.” Well, this was like bringingcoals to Newcastle where America was concerned. What Crowley meant was “theworld needs a new religion.” But in the historic time scheme of the evangelists,insofar as the masses were tempted into self and socially destructive sin, thenew religion to replace the bad old ways of murder, drunkenness, slavery, andprostitution was Christianity, which signaled the end of pagan cruelties andpersecution and oppression, as was understood, and was ever new when experiencedas salvation by the redeemed sinner. It was all a bit late for a resurgence ofthe mind of Roman Emperor Julian the Apostate, who, like Gore Vidal, wished toturn the tide of imperial religion back to an enlightened and civicallyresponsible paganism. Crowley was in fact preaching only to the deconverted,those who were already frustrated with conventional religion for whateverreason.Still, Crowley persisted with a vain effort to turn Freemasons on to themysteries and secrets regular Masonry frequently alluded to, but never seemed todeliver. In his innocence, Crowley was soon to find out what really drove somany of those who claimed to embrace Freemasonry’s elementary principles of“Brotherly Love, Charity, and Truth.”The fact is that The Equinox was not an easy read. The English was impeccable,which only made it seem more remote to nonscholars. There was Crowley’scommentary on Blavatsky’s The Voice of the Silence that he sincerely believedwould shake the Theosophical Society out of its “Gentle Jesus meek and mild”state into waking up to the Aeon of Force and Fire. There were many eruditepleas for the establishment of the Thelemic principle; there was poetry; therewas even the Gnostic Mass reproduced in full, and delightful to those who valuedritual (which discounted most of the Protestant tradition!); but it was short onlaughs, and the life of “Light, Love, and Liberty” looked like not a little hardwork, and all for what?—To surmount the doctrine of Original Sin? Many Christianbelievers already took it that Jesus had “dealt with that” by taking the rap onGolgotha. As Crowley knew perfectly well, it was the Pauline influencedChristian St. Augustine who had encapsulated the state of the redeemed as “Love,and do what you will.” Had Crowley argued squarely for a refinement andenrichment of existing religion he might have got somewhere as a progressivereformer, but the anti-Christian tone of his arguments looked to “Old Aeon”mentalities suspiciously unhealthy, with his equal tolerance for NeoplatonicTheurgy, sexual liberty, and subtle doctrines about Satan and solar phallicism.But of course, the Decadent Crowley wanted to splash cold water in the face ofoppressive evangelicalism, and épater les bourgeoises at the same time, for hefirmly believed he was living in a decaying culture whose neurotic corruptionhad been made vividly, agonizingly evident in the last four and a half years ofworld war. And he did believe The Book of the Law held the formula of the NewAeon. And all he could do was trumpet it and let the gods take the strain. Theydidn’t; he did.On April 13, 1919, fired up by Jones’s message and Ryerson’s accounts of hismeetings with the Magus, senior Detroit Scottish Rite Freemasons agreed to forman O.T.O. Supreme Grand Council.12 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt597] Thebeginnings of such was assembled at the exclusive Athletic Club in downtownDetroit. District Attorney Frank Murphy described the members of the tentativeCouncil as such: “They are big men. The mention of their names would immediatelybring on a scandal.”13 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt598] However, they would onlyproceed on condition Crowley rewrite the O.T.O. rituals to remove too-overtcrossovers with regular “Blue” Masonry, to avoid offending existing Masonicjurisdictions. This referred in particular to the first three degrees, whosethird referred to the murder of Hiram, Solomon’s temple builder. Crowleysubstituted the Sufi saint Al-Hallaj, who was crucified by orthodox Islamicauthorities in 922 CE for declaring (among other things), “I am Truth.”Crowley, his fare to Detroit paid by lawyer and “spiritualist” Frank T. Lodge,affiliated seven men into the O.T.O. at the Detroit Athletic Club: seven membersof the Ancient & Accepted Rite’s Supreme Grand Council, and Albert Ryerson. Theywere not initiated; members paid dues and recognition was granted that they heldO.T.O. rank consistent with Masonic rank. Crowley, trying to maintain Masonicdecorum and his sense of the dignity of O.T.O. grades ended up giving offense toRyerson’s partner and president in the Universal Book Store, Dr. Hill. Ryersonwas also miffed by Crowley’s refusing to allow them onto the O.T.O. SupremeGrand Council. As Ryerson would later testify:Because of the book store’s officers [not] being a part of it, Dr. Hill tookgreat exception and thought that inasmuch as we were going to market theliterature of the Order, someone of us ought to be represented, and he made somevery terse comments about it and Crowley in the store here. And the result of itall was that Dr. Hill said, “Well, we won’t handle your books” and he then triedto cancel the order, and made a mess of it generally, and that started the fussbetween them.14 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt599]Meanwhile, Ryerson, influenced by the life, love, and liberty of Thelema,incurred his wife’s filing for divorce when he found new lover Bertha AlmiraPrykyl née Bruce, owner of a rooming house at 381 West Grand Boulevard.According to a scurrilous C. F. Russell, seeking to sell out Crowley in 1922,Bertha was also charmed by Crowley’s rouged cheeks and the kohl on hiseyelids.15 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt600] Russell asserted that Crowley wasencouraged by Ryerson to make love with Bertha so Ryerson that could learn thesecrets of the IX°, and the three allegedly took ether and hashish beforeCrowley had his ritual way with Bertha, while Ryerson allegedly slumped out ofhis mind on a bed claiming to be “Amoun.” Crowley’s story was different.Bertha lent money for the production of The Equinox, and, on Crowley’s visit inApril, became Crowley’s lover also.*192 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft192] Sosmitten was the Beast that he seriously considered her an alternative to the Apeof Thoth until mid-1920. Crowley’s account was that Ryerson was so obsessed withfinding the secret of sexual magick he knew Crowley possessed, that he listenedat the keyhole of Crowley and Bertha Bruce’s love nest in the hope of hearingsomething to clue him in to the great mystery. This all gives a flavor of thecraziness that soon filled the Detroit would-be O.T.O. scene like smoke from agenie’s bottle. Commenting on events decades later to Martin P. Starr,biographer of Vancouver O.T.O. deputy leader W. T. Smith, C. F. Russellreflected: “You’ll never know what happened in Detroit.”16[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt601] The trouble is that we can’t be altogether surethat Russell knew everything either. Russell didn’t join Jones in Detroit untilmid-May, when he participated in Jones’s lectures. By 1920, Jones and Russellshared accommodation at Vinewood Avenue in the city.Crowley had returned to New York in April. Within ten days of the athletic clubmeeting he’d revised initiation rituals ready to hand on to Jones. Jones, inturn, informed Frank Lodge that the O.T.O. Supreme Grand Council should hastento establish the O.T.O.’s Detroit “Oasis” and prepare for performinginitiations.Crowley turned his attention to Russell, who was already showing signs ofwillful wildness, and “rushing in,” both in sexual matters and in formingjudgments of people. Crowley wrote to him on May 27:The main point is that your courage is greater than your discretion. Witnessyour little experiment at the hospital [Annapolis Naval Hospital]. It’s the bestfault a man can have but it certainly gets him into more hot water than most ofthe vilest vices. You are very young and I don’t want to see you in a mess, as Ihave seen so many. I should like to see your [magical] record but not untilJones has commented upon it. I should like to be able to comment on hiscomments, thus killing two magicians with one memorandum. Tell Jones that thatis my idea. . . . Incidentally, you are in a rather privileged position withregard to hearing things and it is perhaps no harm, in your case, but at yourage you have not the experience to estimate such things with due balance. Aperson may state an opinion not because he holds it but because he wants to hearit discussed.17 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt602]Crowley got on with the job of finding agents to spread the Law through TheEquinox. One of the many scandals that erupted out of the whole Equinox-Detroitaffair, especially after the Beast left America, was how it came to be that somany copies of The Equinox turned up in Hollywood, where yellow-pressjournalists tried to implicate the O.T.O. in sex, drugs, and murder scandals,treating the book as if it were an incendiary Mein Kampf, whoever touched itbeing driven to sociopathic excess. The agent Crowley chose for dissemination inHollywood was none other than Betty Bickers, wife of screenwriter SheridanBickers, both of whom Crowley had met in British Columbia at the end of 1915:Betty, as likely as not, intimately. He wrote to Betty:My dearest Betty,. . . I wish you would take up definitely the work of the Equinox. You could doa great deal in Los [Angeles] to prepare the way for me to come down there oneday.Love is the law, love under will.18 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt603]On April 20, Crowley wrote to Jones about Mrs. Bickers.Betty Bickers is free of her crazy husband for the time being at least and shetoo might act as Equinox agent &c. Her address is 302 Formosa Apt. HollywoodBoulevard, Hollywood, California. I myself got it on Wednesday night.19[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt604]He also wrote to Marie Lavroff (who had pneumonia) about fallout in Detroit.I am very sorry indeed to hear of your being ill. . . . We have all of us gotit, in one way or another. Nearly everybody in Detroit connected with us hadsome trouble. A magical gesture like the publication of the Equinox gets all theblack magicians going. Roddie and the Dead Soul [Leah] have both been in troubleand even I had a sensitive spot, as I discovered Wednesday, when I was quitebadly burnt in an extremely mysterious manner. . . . Please write as often asyou feel able.Love is the law, love under will.20 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt605]Crowley maintained contact with Helen Hollis in Maryland, writing to her from 63Washington Square South as his “Darling sweetheart baby girl,” signing off as“Ever your own true sweetheart.” He wanted Helen to spend time in the studio, ashe had written on April 5.My dear sweet purple baby girl,. . . Send picture of yourself you promised. The Queen of the dead souls [Leah]wants to see it too. You will have to meet her of course. It ought to be allright, you are such a perfect little plum-pudding, and if so, there will be noreason why you should not stay in this luxury apartment. . . . Good thing if youhad a crimson and ochre kimono to lend a touch of colour to this drab studio.Love is the law, love under will, Ever your eager sweetheart, A21[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt606]It seems that Crowley was able to get Leah to accommodate Helen at No. 63 on thebasis of Helen’s playing studio assistant and nanny to Leah’s baby, Hansi, whowas otherwise cared for in Florida. Helen Hollis received a letter dated May 6from “L. Carter”—Leah had been married to Hansi’s father, a Mr.Carter—containing Helen’s fare and expenses so she could come to WashingtonSquare to “take charge of my studio and my baby.”22[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt607] How very New Aeon, Leah!Crowley meanwhile regarded his studio as a place to gather people, talk, andgenerally stir things up. He issued a satirical invitation: Crowley’s spin onthe intensifying clamor of the Temperance Movement for the complete prohibitionof the sale of alcohol in America. Crowley fought against restriction by exampleand invited others to join him, suggesting that you could get more narcoticpoisoning from the streets of New York than a kick from drinking or drug taking,the slang for which effect was a jag.JULY 1ST.

Love is the law,love under will.One journalist left the following account of a pioneering experience akin to thepublic demonstrations of Situationists, Dadaists, and Surrealists in Europe inthe 1920s, or the Acid Tests of the 1960s.Once out in Washington Square, the visitor took several deep breaths, caughtbenzine fumes, walked a strait path, thought normally and wondered, “Where isthe benzine jag?”Yet unquestionably, he had been under the influence of the benzine because, forthree hours, he had been glibly conversing on his “inner self” and a rarevariety of subjects with which he had heretofore been slightly acquainted. Andfurthermore he had made several warm friendships under the influence of thebenzine.Here is the prescription for the “benzine jag” which doctors say is not harmfulif taken in small quantities, Mr. Crowley avers. “Buy an ordinary can ofbenzine, take a dropper, get capsules, put twenty drops of benzine in eachcapsule, and then take it as if it were a pill.”*193[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft193]23 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt608]On May 8, 1919, Leon Engers Kennedy married redheaded Irish American beautyCatherine “Kitty” Reilly, aged twenty-four, esteemed by photographer ArnoldGenthe as one of the most extraordinary beauties he had ever seen. Crowley’sConfessions are not generous with regard to the marriage, one that Crowley, inretrospect and with a spiteful edge, opined would drag the aspiring artist downto mediocrity and that marked a nadir in their long-term relations, though notat all as bitter a breach as was Victor Neuburg’s quitting Crowley in 1914.There may be more to the story.Unfortunately, the chief source for the “dirt” is journalist William B.Seabrook, who dramatized—well, what?—Crowley and Engers’s alleged falling out ina salacious, over-the-top slush tale published, with lurid illustrations, onSunday, April 8, 1923, in the Indianapolis Star under the sensational titleASTOUNDING SECRETS OF THE DEVIL-WORSHIPPERS’ MYSTIC LOVE CULT. Had Crowleywanted this kind of reputation, meeting Seabrook would have been the fulfillmentof his life: Shock! Horror!Seabrook’s observation, drawn from the man he knew in Washington Square in 1919,was of “the most amazing mixture of good and bad that has ever existed in humanform.” Crowley was as capable of compelling admiration as repulsion. Seabrookdescribes a highly entertaining scene in Crowley’s studio, with the Beast givingan affable lecture on Egyptology while Kitty Reilly caught his eye. Engersshouts out, “Her aura is turning red!” to which Crowley replied, “It’s alwaysbeen red, you fool.” Crowley then told Engers he should stop losing himself inauras he imagined and get himself into the real Kitty Reilly. He should marryher and have babies and then paint as many psychochromes as he liked; but marrythe girl and make her happy first. She did not want to be spiritually adored,just loved. “But no!” cried Engers, “You don’t understand; she’s a spiritualsoul. Her aura even now is turning blue again.” Crowley more or less said we’llsee about that, and offered her the Mark of the Beast to make her red again,whereupon he sank his teeth into Kitty’s neck and gave her the Crowley-brand“serpent’s kiss” he’d given to Helen Westley in 1915, and which he’d give toNancy Cunard on her right wrist in the 1920s. Kitty became red with rage,hurling foul abuse at the man who had the temerity to make her neck bleed.Engers was outraged, disgusted, but did nothing to Crowley.image [images/9781620556313_086.jpg]Fig. 33.13. “Mrs. Engers” (Kitty Engers) by Frieda Gertrud Reiss-Berlin(1890–ca. 1955)image [images/9781620556313_087.jpg]Fig. 33.14. William Seabrook’s lurid account of Engers allegedly attackingCrowley in 1919; Indianapolis Star, April 1923 (image courtesy of Frank vanLamoen)Seabrook describes the scene’s denouement as taking place at his own apartmentat 23 Christopher Street. Kitty was watching Engers playing chess with Seabrookwhen Crowley arrived, intoning the familiar Thelemic greeting with the caveataimed at Engers, “that is, if you have brains enough to know what you reallywish.” Engers flew into a white rage, telling Crowley he knew what he wanted,and that was for Crowley to leave Kitty alone, or else he’d break every bone inCrowley’s body. Engers tried to go back to the chess game but was seething.Crowley puffed his cigarette until it glowed, then jammed it down Engers’s shirtcollar, saying, “All you both need is stirring up.” Engers leaped like a wildthing onto Crowley, and they started rolling over the floor, “pounding andchoking each other.” Over went Seabrook’s center table, down fell a mirror, withthe struggle ending, with Seabrook’s intervention, in deadlock.Leaving Seabrook’s, Engers and Crowley apparently hated each other, but soonafter Engers took Crowley’s advice and married Kitty. Happy together, they wentto Holland, and Seabrook’s article’s postscript was that he’d just received apostcard from the loving couple, sending “kindest regards to everybody.”24[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt609]Shocking!"},{"pageContent":"THIRTY-FOURimage [images/9781620556313_099.jpg]Summer in Montauk—and a Thousand Years AgoWhy Crowley chose Montauk at Long Island’s east end for his 1919 summerretirement is a question Spence felt might be answered by considering the areaas one of the most militarized on the East Coast.1[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt610] The U.S. Navy pursued experimental operationsthere, and the remarkable physicist Nikola Tesla (1856–1943) had already beenexperimenting with the idea of electronic warfare and harnessing the Earth’smagnetism to supply free electricity—at which notion his funding sources,predictably, dried up. Tesla had built a tower as part of his experiments, butthe military demolished it, fearing it could assist German spies in sendingmessages across the Atlantic. No doubt Britain’s N.I.D. would be interested inanything on these lines, but whether Crowley was, on its, or anyone else’sbehalf, is impossible to say; there is no evidence for any such thing. He wasprobably not the first person to pitch up a tent near Montauk, despite theplagues of flies that often erupt in summertime. It was conveniently situated atthe end of the railway line and was his kind of place. As far as we know, thesole current to which 666 was connected was what he called “the magicalcurrent,” and, according to the Confessions, it was during his summer retirementat Long Island’s extremity that he concluded “the current was exhausted. I hadfinished my work in America and began to prepare my escape.”2[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt611]And well he might do, if we account as significant motivation that summer’sflurry of investigation into Crowley’s activities undertaken by B.I. agent FrankX. O’Donnell. Trouble with the B.I. flared up after letters from several ofCrowley’s opponents arrived at Washington’s Department of Justice. On June 4,1919, an anonymous letter addressed to “Attorney General Palmer” was sent fromNew York.Dear Sir:If you desire to find the master mind that is secretly directing the bomboutrages, request the police force to look into the doing [sic] of AleisterCrowley, 1, University Place, this City. He is an Irishman, a college man, poseshere as an Englishman; was, at one time, associate editor of the Fatherland.Much too clever and cunning to ever himself be caught doing unlawful acts, butthe directing and planning mind behind men of lesser intelligence. A man, who,for his crimes of moral turpitude alone, should be imprisoned as was OscarWilde, or else deported. He cannot return to England, though—a warrant iswaiting for him there.It will take one of the cleverest detective [sic] many months to get evidenceagainst him, for the man is far more shrewd than any living being. A real powerfor evil among men such as can scarcely be conceived of.Terror of what he may do makes me fear to give my name and address, but do notconsider this information lightly. I know absolutely wherof I speak.3[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt612]A photostat of the letter was sent by Washington’s B.I. “Acting Chief”*194[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft194] to Captain W. M. Offley, Box 241, City HallStation, New York, on June 6 with the comment, “This is for your information andsuch attention as you deem advisable.”4 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt613]A few days later Washington’s Justice Department received another curious letterabout Crowley, this time sent on June 9 from Joseph Norwood, prominent KentuckyFreemason and contributor to the Masonic magazine The Builder, writing on behalfof “The International Magian Society,” based at 815, Republic Building,Louisville, Kentucky. Norwood informs the “Chief of Intelligence Bureau” that he(Norwood) is investigating Crowley for the sake of a society “composed mainly ofFreemasons” interested in “modern researches connected with the welfare of theMasonic order. . . . We are gathering,” he says, “information relative tocertain propaganda—pro-German, Sinn-Fein, Bolshevist and I.W.W. etc. which webelieve to be inimical to our country as well as to the order of Masons, and agood deal of which seems to be carried on by fakirs professing great love forboth.” This interest, he claims, led them to look into “this man Crowley.”Norwood then quotes “from a letter written us in answer to queries made of himto one of his friends.” The quote relates, he says, to Crowley’s connectionswith Viereck and the “proclamation of Irish Independence” where he proclaimedhimself, Norwood assumes, “president of the Irish Republic, which he denies.”Then comes the alleged quote from Crowley: “I was employed by the SecretService, my main object being to bring America into the War, my main method toget the Germans to make asses of themselves by increasing their Frightfulnessuntil even the Americans kicked.” Norwood concludes: “Crowley does not seem tohave done any great amount of actual harm, but we should like to complete ourrecords in his case if you can favor us. His work has chiefly been carried onunder the guise of various ‘occult orders’ of his peculiar manufacture. We havewritten Scotland Yard a similar request.”5 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt614]The background to this informant’s gripe is made clear in Richard Kaczynski’sbiography of Crowley, Perdurabo, wherein we learn that the Louisville, Kentucky,distributor of the Blue Equinox was reconsidering handling it. Ryerson blamedfellow Mason Joseph Norwood, who he said was concerned with evil reports“circulated,” maintained Ryerson, “by our enemies.”6[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt615]Washington’s acting chief of the B.I. replied to Norwood on June 18, 1919, tothe effect that it was not the department’s policy to open files to other thanfederal officials, nor was he at liberty to say whether inquiries concerningCrowley had been made.7 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt616]It is clear Washington’s passing the matter over to newly reappointed B.I.superintendent William M. Offley in New York led to agent Frank O’Donnellundertaking his investigation into Crowley of July 1919, which investigationwould eventually furnish the basis for J. Edgar Hoover’s intelligence concerningthe Mage.O’ Donnell’s reports began after the first week of July with the statement thatthe New York office had received a photostat letter from the acting chief,initialed D.M.D., dated June 6, indicating that the “subject” was a “dangerousradical type” and should be carefully investigated. O’Donnell commenced the taskunder instructions from Assistant Superintendent Baker. His first deposition wasa “confidential report” dated July 8, 1919, from the “British Secret ServiceBureau,” quite likely coming out of Frederick Hall either at 44 Whitehall orfrom one of the British Military Missions (on Broadway or in Washington); thatis, post-Gaunt British intelligence that did not trust Crowley, found his Statueof Liberty stunt inflammatory, and regarded his Fatherland submissions aspro-German propaganda, even if absurd or, as Crowley claimed, deliberatelydetrimental to the German cause.ALESTAIR [SIC] CROWLEYThe above came to the attention of the police in 1900, when he held a series ofmeetings at which so-called mystic rites were performed and at which improperactivities were alleged to have occurred. These meetings were held in London [itis unclear what “meetings” are referred to], and he has devoted most of his timebefore coming to this country to the same pursuits which every now and againcaused the police in England to investigate him.Since Crowley has been in America, he has claimed to be on a British Mission,whereas he left his own country because he feared arrest. He joined GeorgeSylvester Viereck, latterly editing the publication known as The International.In July 1915, Crowley, one Leilah Waddell, J. Orr [the New York Times had“Dorr”], an editor, Patrick Gilroy, an agitator, and several others, went to theStatue of Liberty. They described themselves as members of “The SecretRevolutionary Committee of Public Safety of the Provisional Government of theIrish Republic”. They announced they were going to declare Ireland’sindependence. Crowley took the lead—by tearing up his passport, and afterreading a lengthy, strange, incoherent document, he renounced allegiance to the“alien tyrant”, and took an oath to fight to the last drop of his blood forIreland. An Irish flag was hoisted.The Attorney-General of the state of New York caused Crowley to be examined inthe Murray Hill Hotel on October 11th 1918.Crowley is distinctly fond of appearing in print, and when he does so tells hisinterrogators for the newspapers that he was wounded and came here on a specialmission. He has never been in the army and could be [my italics] detained if hereturned to England.His claim also has been that he joined up with Viereck in order to obtaininformation for the British government. This is of course absurd. He is atpresent living at No. 16 or 60 Washington Place [incorrect] and is supposed tohave started a so-called “Ordo Templi Orientis”, of which he claims to be agrand master, in Fifth Avenue.Crowley has written a lot of queer books and poems. He is about 46 years old andis a graduate of Trinity College, Cambridge.Investigation will be continued.8 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt617]It is not clear from the report which parts of the above came from BritishIntelligence verbatim and which might have been O’Donnell’s incorporation orparaphrases from other sources. One would hope that British Intelligence sourcescould have been more accurate than to misspell Crowley’s name and include otherplainly prejudicial elements and distorted facts. Crowley never claimed to havebeen wounded in the army, for example, and the source’s view of Crowley’s bookswas irrelevant. It is a damning exercise, defamatory and, one supposes,deliberately so. It was, I might say, unimaginative mismanagement to dismissCrowley and his talents as those of a quack.Spence’s view is that Crowley had nonetheless been related to a spookloop thatwent direct to Captain Reginald “Blinker” Hall (1873–1943), director of theadmiralty’s Intelligence Division from 1914, who had his own priorities. Theevidence at present is that Crowley indeed submitted information to the directorof Naval Intelligence, through Everard Feilding, initially at least, but thatNaval Intelligence did not regard Crowley as a formal asset, on account of theinformation’s weaknesses, but that does not preclude an “understanding” of hispotential value, or knowledge that he was not, as he appeared, a traitor. AsCrowley himself maintained, had he been encouraged, he believed he was in aposition to have obtained considerably more in the way of strategicallysignificant secrets but that naval liaison officer (from 1917) Gaunt (navalattaché 1914–1917) considered Crowley an unnecessary, untrustworthy obstruction,an annoying loose cannon whom he could not stomach. It seems on the evidencereasonable to assume that home intelligence MI5’s director Vernon Kell andMansfield Smith-Cumming, head of foreign intelligence, had their own assessmentsof Crowley’s value, informed by Crowley’s prewar reputation and, above all, hisfateful, freelance Statue of Liberty stunt, implicating him with IrishRepublicanism, a priority issue for Britain’s home and foreign intelligenceservices. The last thing an intelligence service wants of its agents isnotoriety, which of course attracts attention and investigation. Crowley’s viewwas that glamour makes excellent cover, deflecting attention from the real.O’Donnell’s next report showed that he followed up the information aboutCrowley’s having been interviewed in October 1918 by a representative of the NewYork State attorney general and so went to that office, meeting a Mr. Simon, whotold him they had a “more or less extensive file” on Crowley, but it was inAlbany, and could be examined by O’Donnell within the week.9[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt618]On July 24, O’Donnell called at 236 West 15th Street hoping to find a Miss K.Stevens, who had information about Crowley, but she was not there, so he went tothe office of New York State’s attorney general at 51 Chambers Street, where Mr.Simon gave him their Crowley file, on condition that it be returned no laterthan August 1st. O’Donnell then went to the office of the “U.S.R.R.Administration [United States Railroad Administration] Secret Service Bureau inthe Grand Central terminal,” where he interviewed a Mr. Flynn, who gave him apamphlet, “The Reconquest of America,” regarding which O’Donnell was informedCrowley may have been the author.10 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt619]Two days later O’Donnell spent time looking at the files he’d received from Mr.Simon and found additional material “of a British source” about Crowley.Crowley has never had anything whatever to do with any British official in thiscountry. His offers of service here have always been rejected, and he has beenregarded as a harmless neurotic. He was never taken seriously even in hisefforts against his native country. It was known by the police and others thatanything Crowley, and those associated with him did, could not sway any honestor clean opinion. His allegation that he was doing something for his Governmentwhile working for George Sylvester Viereck is absurd, as Crowley freelycriticized his own country to help himself financially as soon as he landed inAmerica. He found sympathy among the renegade Irish, and those of theClan-Na-Gael or Sinn Fein element.An article published in the New York World on August 2nd 1914, gives a fair ideaof Crowley and an alleged Black Mass which was celebrated by him in London. Inthe same paper in December 1914, Crowley denied that he had participated in sucha ceremony, asserting that he had hypnotized the newspaper-man who wrote it. . ..Crowley wrote an article in the Rheinisch Westfalisch Zeitung [see here[9781620556313_c20.xhtml#p368]] purporting to describe a visit to Englandeighteen months or two years after the War started, and following his stay inAmerica. The article was a reflection on English morale, and conditions inEngland, and yet it was known that Crowley had never returned to England sincehe set foot on American soil.Crowley, as head of his so-called Lodge, had rooms at 93, Regent Street, London.In June 1917, this place was raided, and a Mary Davies was arrested as afortune-teller.Incidentally, Crowley claims that he became connected with Viereck through a manon a ‘bus. His story is:“A man spoke to me on a ’bus, asking me if I wanted a square deal for Germanyand Austria. I replied no-comiittally that I wanted a square deal for everybody.He asked me to call at the “Fatherland” office. I did. I was there recognized byViereck, who had once seen me in the office of the “English Review”. My airyattitude was construed by him as pro-German.”To be continued.11 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt620]On July 26, O’Donnell met Miss Kate Stevens by appointment at the publiclibrary. Miss Stevens had in the past furnished information regarding peopleinvolved with radical activities, including material on Pearson’s Magazineeditor Frank Harris. Miss Stevens said that she had never met Crowley and knewnothing of him. “The only point that she thought might be of interest to us,”wrote O’Donnell, “is involved in a theory of hers that it might be possible thatFrank Harris and Aleister Crowley might be one and the same party. This, ofcourse, is impossible and I so informed Miss Stevens.”12[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt621] Miss Stevens added that if she heard anythingabout Crowley she would not hesitate to report it. This gives us some idea ofthe paucity of hard information informants about Crowley could furnish theauthorities. One wonders why O’Donnell did not seek out Crowley himself and savehimself much trouble.It is interesting that O’Donnell’s report of his returning the Crowley file toMr. Simon of the attorney general’s office in October 1919 now appeared underthe heading “Alleged Radical Activities” (my italics) rather than, as hitherto,“Radical Activities.” O’Donnell withheld a copy of the July 17, 1918,examination, which in his report was mistakenly dated “1919.”13[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt622] Its contents would serve as meat for a“Memorandum” on Crowley prepared for “Mr. Hoover” by Washington’s Department ofJustice, Bureau of Investigation, in early January 1920, after Crowley hadreturned, unhindered, to Great Britain.Before Crowley made his “escape” from the United States, he spent his summerretirement at Montauk not in undertaking subversive radical activity but intaking a deep trip down memory lane with extensive sammasati trances to uncoverprevious incarnations. The resulting meditations were nothing less thancolorful, and he wrote them up in the diary document The Hermit of OesopusIsland, because they extended work accomplished in the Hudson River Valley theprevious summer.On July 4, Crowley, or “essence of Crowley,” got back to the incarnation beforeMarius de Aquilis after finding that as Aquilis he had been born in a northItalian city, possibly Florence, coming to Rome in adolescence. Before Marius hewas a woman, Claudia. He couldn’t be sure of the surname other than it ended in“ini,” possibly Venturini. Claudia—known to enemies as “La Verolina”—had hugemasses of orange gold hair, which sounds like Hilarion: that might explain theattraction! A cardinal was Claudia’s first lover, a black magician who vowed herto Satan. She hated her mother; a fat, blond harlot whom Claudia poisoned ataged fifteen. She had faulty reproductive organs that made her sterile andinsatiable, as well as “tight and spasmodic.” She was finally burned at thestake, and as the flames crept up, “Satan” appeared again in the smoke andtransfigured her into the flames that fed on her flesh, making her death “anexquisite pang of bliss.” A nobleman’s wife who was present, three monthspregnant, received “her” as his next incarnation, and he was born as Marius deAquilis.Then on July 16 at 8:40 p.m. he realized that he had been Pope Alexander VI(1431–1503), the debauched Renaissance pope born Roderic Borgia. “Crowley” tookpride in the fact that he was the first lover of Lucrezia Borgia, recalling athousand details of the intrigue. He took oaths to the Romish Church withoutrealizing they would inhibit his intentions, resulting in “Division” when hefinally realized he wanted to reinstitute paganism. He reckoned the masses werewith him, preferring Venus to “Mopish Mary,” but theologians were “toonarrow-minded to agree,” taking, as they did, the fathers of the churchseriously. He felt this all explained later incarnation Lévi’s “flirtation” withRome before he abandoned Catholic ministry for magic. He felt that theseexperiences explained why he had at last decided to follow Siegfried and not tomend the broken sword but to melt it down and forge a new one from the elements.As Alexander VI (his middle name and number, he observed), he had been ignorantenough to think that he had altogether failed, and explained why “A.C.” hadnever taken to Renaissance things. On July 16 he got a brief glimpse of “theMagician” who finally worked up to the flower that was, in retrospect, AlexanderVI. He then had a sense that he was in the mid-seventeenth century a “lord ofthe Sabbath”—presumably referring to the spirit of the witch cults that inducedsuch hysterical persecution in that period. Somehow he knew what becameeventually Jeanne Foster, identifying her as “the Devil’s Mistress” that gaveGolden Dawn member John William Brodie-Innes’s 1915 novel its name.*195[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft195] Somehow Crowley incited free love, free thought,free speech, free act in a way quite crude that he would not make the error ofrepeating.He then “got into” a former life as page to the last grand master of the KnightsTemplar, Jacobus Burgundus Molensis (Jacques de Molay), who was roasted alive inParis in 1314. As page, he was initiated into the Eastern-occidental mysteriesof the temple, making great progress, only to be murdered fouly by emissaries ofjealous French king Philippe le Bel, who brought ruin on the Order. The page’sname was something like Hugo de Larens, which sounds a bit too much like TemplarOrder founder Hugo de Payens, who died some 180 years before his successor, deMolay.†196 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft196] He had an Arabic nickname, and it wasfury at the killing of de Molay that led to his incarnating as a magician whomade a great and terrible oath against Christianity, “which I have still notworked off. Nor will I while the accursed thing still poisons the air of oursweet Mother Earth.”This magician was born in an Eastern Templar preceptory “far hidden in Asia”—andat this point Crowley’s “memories” enter territory redolent of George Gurdjieff’s alleged adventures in the latter magician’s Meetings with Remarkable Men(still unwritten and much of which perhaps unlived).*197[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft197] Crowley saw the birthplace as a crag fortresswith a cultivated garden beyond which rose wasted hills then great mountains.Was it called El Latifu or El Azizu? he wondered. Templars at this site wereapparently tremendous magicians. Even his birth as Baal Zakar was an act ofmagick: the Templars’ share in the great mythical oath of vengeance against thepowers that destroyed the temple. Crowley’s trance led him to believe that hisincarnation as the pope was Baal Zakar’s effort to rule the world by intellectand to express the revolt against the destroyers of the temple “in thephysical.” This failed, Crowley believed, “because there was not enoughinitiation to back up my Magick.”On July 29 he had memories of his “Great Incarnation.” Crowley’s description ofthe village setting is most interesting. He recalls a village in a valleyclustering about a monastery with square towers of adobe or “some such stuff.”There was a mountain path from the village, nearly a day’s walk up. The gate wasguarded by two “Mongolians.” Beyond trees was a stone shrine, a “conical whitestone set in a cube.” The latter detail is highly reminiscent of Yezidi tombs(called qubbe) in the sacred valley Lalish, in northern Iraq, burial place ofone of the greatest Sufi masters of the thirteenth century, who identifiedhimself with the spirit of God, united in samadhi, and mouthpiece of revelation.Crowley believed his Holy Guardian Angel, Aiwass, was somehow identified withthe “Peacock Angel,” Melek (Lord) Ta’wus, the Yezidi lord of the createduniverse. Crowley, however, had never been to Mesopotamia, and that just mightbe why he thinks the vision he had of this place he “inclined to place in theHindu Kush”—as, interestingly, Gurdjieff placed one of his key monasteries ofthe universal truth in Meetings with Remarkable Men. Crowley’s incarnation saw aglacier, “like Mont Collon,” in the Alps. He lived there many years and was“pretty sure” the monks were Mahayana Buddhists, of sorts. He, however, was notone of them. Far down the valley was a way over mountains to the south, whichlanded him in Persia after a long journey. Iran, incidentally, is reachableacross the mountains southeast of Lalish. Crowley was sure all this took placebefore Mohammed, when the Persians were “Ghebers”; that is, Zoroastrians.On August 2, 1919, Crowley experienced a memory of a great consistory of adepts,at which “the man who was afterwards Mohammed” attended. The policy of Crowley’ssupernal Order Aimage [images/dots.jpg]Aimage [images/dots.jpg] was discussed.He remembers being present with the beings who manifested in the nineteenth andtwentieth centuries as Allan Bennett, Theodor Reuss, Helena Blavatsky, andGeorge Cecil Jones (whose face appears as the satyr in the May Morn painting;Jones founded the Aimage [images/dots.jpg]Aimage [images/dots.jpg] with Crowleyin 1907). Other “great mystics” voted solidly against “doing anything at all” asfar as revealing initiated secrets to humankind were concerned. It was decidedat the conference that “we” (presumably the aforementioned) decided to work inthe West. “He” got the pagan and ritual work, which ended with Alexander VI.Reuss (Frater “Merlin,” cofounder of the O.T.O.) afterward was Adam Weishaupt(1748–1830), founder of the Illuminati. George Cecil Jones “worked the CRC act”(that is, the Rosicrucian movement) and “subsequently went wrong.” This hadconsequences in America, where, according to the Confessions, “I met the headsof four flourishing cults who claimed to be Rosicrucians. Not one of them had somuch as heard of the Fama Fraternitatis or the Chymical Marriage.”14[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt623]“Pre-Mohammed” was, Crowley recalled, “the biggest man there, but his plan lefthim in a minority of “One.” He said he’d do it anyhow. Of course the time wasn’tripe. Another man took care of art, learning, and such, and was presentlyParacelsus (1493–1541). The great issue was, Are we to initiate the people? Ivoted yes, with certain limitations—I am still in trouble with the muddle ofthat! The ‘quiet mystics’ abstained from voting, not that they approved, butthey thought that we should try it out and learn a lesson. Iehi Aour [AllanBennett’s name in the Golden Dawn] did some Catholic Mysticism in Ireland afterthis, as his job. I wish I could get a full report.”15[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt624]A fragment survives of a lost peroration called The Book of the Great Auk (May14, 1919, 6:30 p.m.). Even though it is dated before Crowley’s summer ofsammasati meditations at Montauk, its contents have a direct bearing on thequestion of whether there could be any real value in reincarnation at all.Crowley begins with a question over the unity of the cosmos.All elements must at one time have been separate—that would be the case withgreat heat. Now when the atoms get to the Sun, when we get to the Sun, we getthat immense, extreme heat, and all the elements are themselves again. Imaginethat each atom of each element possesses the memory of all his adventures incombination.Crowley was wondering whether the essence of a person, being perfect as he heldit to be, gains anything by successive incarnations or experiences. While theessence might remain the same through time, the acquisition of memory throughexperience might be worthwhile; it could become “something more than itselfwithout ceasing to be itself, and thus a real development is possible.” Was hesubconsciously registering a desire to leave this world?*198[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft198]One can then see a reason for any element deciding to go through this series ofincarnations (God, that was a magnificent conception!) because so, and only so,can he go; and he suffers the lapse of memory of His own Reality of Perfectionwhich he has during these incarnations, because he knows he will come throughunchanged.There must, he wrote, be an “infinite number of gods, individual and equalthough diverse,” Crowley concluded, “each one supreme and utterlyindestructible. This is also the only explanation of how a Being could create aworld in which War, Evil, etc., exist. Evil is only an appearance because (like‘Good’) it cannot affect the substance itself, but only multiply itscombinations. . . . If we presuppose many elements, their interplay is natural.It is no objection to this theory to ask who made the elements—the elements areat least there; and God, when you look for him, is not there. Theism is obscurumper obscurius [explaining the obscure by the more obscure].”Crowley then speculated on whether, as a result, Good was as good or bad as Bad,because duality was necessary to acquisition of expanded experience andpotential. He then opted for the way of the Tao as sound, because it ignoredinvolvement with moral issues, coasting supremely on the Way, avoiding extremes.He then began to think about the notorious third chapter of The Book of the Law,with its bioevolutionary indifference to moral issues: “Damn them who pity!”;“the law of the strong; this our law and the joy of the world”; “Compassion isthe vice of kings.” This brings him to the realization that the facts of Naturecannot be ignored.Magicians seem to forget too often that magick must reckon with the facts ofnature. I recall the objection of D.D.S. [George Cecil Jones] to Ra-Hoor-Khuit[the god of Liber AL’s third chapter]; but D.D.S. went into the anti-aircraftservice . . .Crowley’s point was that whatever humanitarian considerations Jones might haveentertained, reality dictated his having to operate anti-aircraft guns in thewar. While objecting to Ra Hoor Khuit’s promise of war and cataclysm, he had,nonetheless, to defend himself and others from its effects; pacifism would nothave helped.We may not like the 3rd chapter of CCXX [Liber AL] but facts is facts. On theother hand, magick has been defined as the attempt to master nature, to set herright. The question is, is this justifiable? If we would set her right we mustbelieve her to be wrong and this, as previously stated, seems to be the point ofview of Choronzon [demon of Dispersions and disintegration, the formless, lossof unity]. If this is the case, magick is nefas [meaning abominable, impious,criminal] and the way of the tao the only proper course.P.S. Well, this getting to a simplicity gives one the whole memory, etc, of thecomplexes with utter understanding. But these become subconscious in the NewBeing. The Ipsissimus reborn. My thoughts tonight are ineffably dazzling andprofound; each phrase a Sunburst.Here is Crowley’s first intimation that there was one grade left to him, almostimpossible to conceive of, according to the Golden Dawn system; Ipsissimus 10° =1▫: the absolute divine essence—the quinta-essentia of Man as divine revelation,the Brahmin’s Atman, his own very Self, beyond concepts and differentiation—God,in a way. Was he unnerved at the prospect? One might think he had sufficient tocontend with being a Magus with a Word for which few had ears to hear.And then it looked like he might be beaten to it. On September 26, CharlesStansfeld Jones wrote to Crowley, implying a claim to be Ipsissimus, the highestgrade of the Order, having identified himself with the Absolute, the sepher of“Kether,” crown of the supernal triad of the Tree of Life. Crowley doubtedJones’s presumption and accepted an invitation to go to Bill and Kate Seabrook’sfarm at Decatur, Georgia.But before he left Montauk, Crowley wrote from there a hasty but interestingnote to Russell, in reply to Russell’s asking him about the Qabalistic number ofhis neophyte motto: γενεσΘαι (genesthai = to have been born).Montauk N.Y. die image [images/img_001.jpg] [sign for Saturn] = SaturdayCimage [images/dots.jpg]Fimage [images/dots.jpg] [Care Frater = Dear Brother]93γενεσΘαι adds 3 + 5 + 50 + 5 + 200 + 9 + 1 + 10 = 373. It is the aoristinfinitive of γενÏ‰, I am born, become &c. I am not quite sure about the Hebrewequivalent; the root GN is the important thing. Sanscrit [sic] JAN to be born.The point is that this root includes the idea of KNOW as Gnosis, Cognizance, &c.Gentle; Gentile, Ingenious, Gonorrhoea [!]; it’s all the same idea.Tao is a pretty good equivalent, so far as anything can be so; but Tao isn’t amotto.I expect to be here till about Aug 4, then N.Y. for a day or two to fix Eq x 2matters: [the follow-up issue of The Equinox, which fell through completely dueto resistance in Detroit] then probably back here for a bit, but I’m not sure asthis is only a Small Magical retirement.93: 93/93Thy brother 666Don’t try to use Greek Qabalah (numerical) for nobody knows anything about it.Here’s a good mantra for Muladhara [chakra] “Ac Pan Pan! Pan Pan Pan!” It addsto 666.16 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt625]Crowley passed to Russell a great deal of esoteric knowledge only, in the end,to be repaid with scorn. In the meantime, Crowley encouraged Russell greatly(perhaps too much), writing to him again at 953 Vinewood Avenue, Detroit, from63 Washington Square on August 11.Care Frater,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.I was very glad indeed to get your letter; it encouraged me a great deal; at themoment I was rather fed up with the Work, to say the Truth for once in my life.You do seem to have grasped the Law, and the principles of Magick; and moreoverhave the guts to put it into practice. Your danger is lack of experience; but ifyou are cautious, and use the scientific method, and don’t try for too much atfirst, you ought to do great things.I am in N.Y. to try to put the Equinox through; owing to Gordon Hill’sdishonesty, and his partner’s incompetence [Ryerson], I am over $4000 short. Icannot find that any of the Detroit people (who make such a show) care in theleast if the Equinox never comes out again. I hope I am all wrong. Anyhow, theGods have whips both for asses and for mules. Also poison for rats.Love is the law, love under will. Fraternally ever,66617 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt626]Decatur must have come as something of a relief, for even as Crowley paintedbeneath Georgia boughs, the work in Detroit, despite Jones’s and Russell’sefforts, mostly fell apart, and the next issue of The Equinox never got furtherthan the proofs, and the pudding wasn’t eaten."},{"pageContent":"THIRTY-FIVEimage [images/9781620556313_099.jpg]End GameBill Seabrook began his journalist career as reporter, then city editor on theAtlanta Chronicle, of which city in DeKalb County, Georgia, Decatur is now adeveloped suburb. Decatur in 1919 was less integrated into the Atlantaconurbation. Many of its old farms have since been remodeled as pleasant, leafyestates, with spacious gardens and an abundance of attractive houses in shadywillow and white oak glades in the Cliff Creek area. Bill and Kate owned one ofthe old farms, and to it, in September 1919, came Aleister Crowley.Seabrook was unhappy working for the Hearst news organization. Believing he hadgenius as a literary man, he found Crowley the right man to encourage hisdreams. Crowley assumed he had a gift for realizing the genius of every “star,”and under his influence, Seabrook’s sense of the high calling of literaturegrew, despite an obvious talent for popular journalism that raked in the bucksand opportunities for travel and excitement. In the 1920s, for example, hejourneyed to West Africa and to Kurdish Yezidi homeland in Iraq. Crowleyreckoned that, separated from his influence, Seabrook would “backslide.” Despite“sporadic attempts to escape from his environment,” as Crowley put it, “thecaress of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the artist’s word andit becomes untruthful.”1 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt627]Crowley would have direct experience of Seabrook’s backsliding when Seabrooksubmitted for publication sensationalized and sensationally distorted accountsof Crowley in the context of witchcraft in books and articles throughout the1920s. In the autumn of 1919, however, everything went well between them, withample opportunity for Crowley to enjoy Kate Seabrook’s passion for him. Leah isunlikely to have joined Crowley in Decatur. “I passed a delightful six weeks inthe south,” wrote Crowley in his Confessions. “Political and social conditionswere of great interest. The standardized surface has overspread the south, butit has not completely smothered the old violence of passion and prejudice. Thehatred of the Yankee and his fear of the Negro are as great as ever. In thelatter case it has increased. The recent revival and the nation-wide spread ofthe Ku-Klux-Klan is one of the most sinister symptoms of recent years.”2[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt628] Sinister symptoms persist today, a centurylater.image [images/9781620556313_088.jpg]Fig. 35.1. William B. Seabrook (seated), with writer, Aldous HuxleyTwo remarkable photographs of Crowley with brushes, canvas, and easel, paintingbeneath shady branches amid the hazy heat of Decatur have survived. In one wesee him sitting on a fruit crate in knickerbockers and a large tweed jacket withhuge pockets, bending forward as he applies a touch to the lower part of afour-foot canvas. He appears to be smoking a cheroot. In the other, stillsitting on his crate, he stares at the camera, hands on his knees. After nearlyfive years in the United States, Crowley had aged noticeably, become morethickset in his shoulders and back, somewhat more intense, and essentiallysolitary. He has the “phallic forelock,” a lonely outcrop of hair atop thehazelnut dome. The face is gaunt, defined, ruddy, certainly not round as peoplealways imagine it. His remaining hair is trimmed short at the sides, and he hasa wispy goatee and hint of a mustache to the edges of his lips. His eyes aresteady, impassive, yet project an unmistakable air of having suffered pain, hischeek lines intersecting with the lines of his forehead like a St. Andrew’scross. In his artist’s neckerchief and explorer-like solidity, he is as ruggedas a pioneer, for that is what he is. There is, nevertheless, a sense of worldweariness, hardly surprising, and an aura of disappointment. What extraordinarythings have happened in that man? Those eyes have seen. His demeanor asks alaconic question of the onlooker: “So what do you know?”image [images/9781620556313_089.jpg]Fig. 35.2. Aleister Crowley painting at Decatur, Georgia, Fall 1919 (Courtesy ofOrdo Templi Orientis)While at Seabrook’s, Crowley was interviewed for the Hearst-owned AtlantaJournal Sunday Magazine, there described respectfully as an “authority inoccultism” by the magazine’s editor, Angus Perkerson, under the headlinePOET-PAINTER WHO STUDIED MAGIC UNDER INDIAN SAVANTS VISITS ATLANTA. Perkerson’sarticle may have been linked to Seabrook’s friendship with fellowHearst-journalist Ward Greene, since Ward Greene cut his teeth on the AtlantaJournal. This would explain how Greene was able to put a fictional version ofCrowley in his novel Ride the Nightmare (1930) about Seabrook and “DeborahLuris,” introduced to Seabrook’s fantasy world by the Crowley character“Bellerophon Cawdor” with its Seabrookian witch-tones from Macbeth. It wouldalso explain Crowley’s references in Confessions to the infamously racist LeoFrank trial and lynching (see here [9781620556313_c07.xhtml#p134]), because itwas Ward Greene who closely covered the story for the Atlanta Journal and basedhis successful, realistic novel Death in the Deep South on his research for thecase. Ward Greene was most likely Crowley’s guide to the ominous social tremorsin the Deep South, especially as Greene reviewed D. W. Griffith’s Birth of aNation (with its celebration of the Ku Klux Klan), and the movie’s rapturousreception in Georgia, for the Atlanta Journal in 1915.After his sojourn at Decatur and Atlanta, Crowley went to Detroit, but hisarrival there was not propitious. Needing to get out, he headed south again tothe Mammoth Caves in Edmonson County, Kentucky.The caves were accessible thanks to the Mammoth Cave Railroad, a short line witha simple steam locomotive and one wooden coach, which ran as a spur from theLouisville and Nashville Railroad over a trestle bridge at Doyle Valley. In 1913the round train trip, hotel, meals, and tour cost $11.75. Which is to say, itwould have made more geographic sense if Crowley visited the caves on his wayfrom Atlanta to Detroit, or as a break on his way back to New York before a lastvisit in November to the “bug-house,” as he called it, of Detroit.Either way, the four hundred miles of subterranean caverns, labyrinths, andpassageways that make the Mammoth Caves “mammoth” in size (hence the name) andthe most extensive explored cave system in the world, made a correspondinglymammoth impression on Crowley’s imagination. He rated the site, set inKentucky’s Green River Valley due south of Fort Knox, as a “wonder of theworld,” up there with Niagara and the Grand Canyon—he was only sorry that hehadn’t had a chance to see Yellowstone Park. When Crowley visited, there wasnotorious in-fighting among farmers and landowners, with attempts to diverttourists from another owner’s caves by changing road signs and planting falsehitchhikers on the roads who told visitors the caves they wanted to see wereclosed for safety reasons, but luckily for the driver, they knew “better” ones.The issues were finally settled when the Mammoth Caves became a U.S. NationalPark in 1941. The Beast returned to Detroit in November 1919, an experience thatcontributed to a lasting sense of repulsion where U.S. Freemasonry wasconcerned, which spleen he vented in his Confessions some five years later. Hecharacterized the Detroit Craft as shallow and duplicitous, shaming Masonicideals with personal jealousies and attempts to make money out of their positionand to exploit Crowley himself. In the main he was misunderstood. Where he wassimple and straightforward, they thought him cunning and diabolical; wheregenerous and openhearted they thought him Machiavellian, his “yes” was just asinister way of saying “no,” and so on.Not everyone associated with the attempt to establish the O.T.O. in Detroitearned Crowley’s ire. According to Crowley, Dr. Frank E. Bowman was an exceptionto the rule.The best of the crowd was a young doctor who had sufficient sense to see howstupid the rest were, to disdain the bluff of the advertising adepts, and torealize that genuine magicians were necessarily gentlemen and scholars. He felthimself utterly lost in the darkness of Detroit, but despaired of mending thematter by setting forth to seek the Graal without guidance. . . . The man hadmany great qualities, but the dollar-snatching charlatans that pullulate inAmerica had driven him to drift and potter. He did not even understand that hemight have saved his soul by devoting himself to the shallowest quack inChicago, daring death and damnation for the hollowest humbug that ever wrotehimself Rosicrucian without knowing how to spell it. Pluck would have pulled himthrough in the long run; as Blake said, “if the fool would persist in his follyhe would become wise.”3 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt629]Crowley saw one of the biggest obstacles he faced in attempting to achieveprogress in America was the very expectation of guaranteed “progress” attendingon every transaction. Crowley surgically isolated what he considered the abidingstrength-turned-weakness of the American system as he experienced it at thetime.How often had he observed the office placard “Come in without knocking. Go outthe same way.” This principle he analyzed as a cardinal weakness. Unpleasanttruths were unwelcome: leave the sleeping sentinel asleep; better still, givehim chloroform so he doesn’t wake up! This, Crowley believed, “Americans” haddeduced as a universal principle from the psychological fact that confidence isa real asset. On the basis that a man works best when he feels sure to succeed,Crowley saw fear of failure corrupting every faculty.The vogue of Christian Science, and countless cults for drawing in dollars bywishing one had them, persuading oneself that somehow or other they will arrive,scorning every success, forgetting every failure, shutting one’s eyes tounpleasant facts, and interpreting every bit of good luck as a triumph beyondthe power of trumpets to tell—a token of the intense interest taken by theAlmighty in His favourite child—this course of conduct, though its morereasonable practitioners are ready to admit that it is rant and rubbish, ispursued as part of a calculated policy. They are ready to fool themselves inorder to take advantage of the stimulating effect of optimism.4[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt630]What accompanied this essential fear of failure was a dread of the spirit ofcriticism. Criticism suggested superiority—God forbid!—an American crime. Werenot all men born equal? As confidence for its own sake had become a universalsolvent, so projected self-confidence quickly degenerated into self-worship,absurd levels of febrile sensitivity and almost concreted egotism.Self-confidence proved you were “in” with God, with material wealth the natural,even supernatural, reward: an expectation. This was, after all, the “PromisedLand,” and its Canaanites languished on reservations, out of view. Crowley sawthe affliction as having arisen out of the conditions of expansion to the west,the real “how the West was won.”The States have been won from the wilderness by a system demanding courage andclear sight from the pioneers; but once the trail was blazed, the rest of thework was done on a basis of credit which a European banker would considerutterly reckless gambling. Everyone, from the farmer and merchant to themanufacturer and financier, entered into a tacit agreement to bet that any givenenterprise would succeed. As the natural resources were there, while luckdecreed that the common-wealth should not have to face any overwhelmingobstacle, the gamblers have won. It is obvious that any man in an outpostbesieged by nature (such as is every new settlement outside New England, theAtlantic coast, and the old settlements in the south) was really a traitor if hesaid, however truthfully, anything which might daunt the spirit of his comrades.Those men won out through sheer ignorance of the chances against them, stolidstupidity which blinded them to their desperate plight and bestial insensibilityto the actual hardships which they had to endure. It was criminal to insist onthe existence of evils for which there was no remedy.This spirit has persisted, though its utility is past. It has become a fixedfeature of the religion of the country. It was the deadliest delusion that I hadto meet. Spiritual attainment, magical; development, any line of work soeverwhose material is subtler than the sensible world, demands (as the firstcondition of success) the most severe spirit of scepticism, the most scientificsystem of research.5 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt631]Very little was accomplished in Detroit during Crowley’s visit, but for asession with Jones signing preliminary pledge forms for potential initiates,rather than, as had been done in April, mere Masonic affiliation to the O.T.O.With Dr. Hill alienated, and Ryerson excluded from the Grand Council of theLakes VII°, there were only four of the original charter members left.One night at Ryerson’s home in November, Ryerson rehearsed an O.T.O. ritual.This innocent activity would be regurgitated by the press in 1922 as a sinisterrite, because it allegedly involved kneeling before a priestess, which“revelation” tells us that it was probably Crowley’s Gnostic Mass that was beingrehearsed.6 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt632] By the time the Detroit press hadturned the O.T.O. into a Satanic cult, and The Equinox had been branded byDetroit police as the wickedest book in the city, with all copies to be seizedto protect citizens from immorality, Crowley was long gone.On December 18, 1917, the U.S. Senate had proposed the 18th Amendment. Supportedby thirty-six states, it was ratified on January 16, 1919. Passing into effecton January 16, 1920, the so-called Volstead Act, or National Prohibition Act,passed Congress over President Woodrow Wilson’s veto on October 28, 1919. Itdefined legally what constituted intoxicating liquor and provided forenforcement. As Crowley predicted, Prohibition led directly to nationalobsession with alcohol and to the swift emergence of the intimidating crimesyndicate; the gangster triumphed while the law became ever more invasive ofpersonal liberty. The individual was hit from all sides. Had Crowley been abottle, he would have been prohibited too. America was no longer a place wherethe Beast could operate effectively. As The Book of the Law declares: “The wordof Sin is Restriction” (AL I:41).Alas, no one took Crowley’s response to the national Prohibition movement as itemerged in a clever, prescient, but unfinished, draft of analysis called “TheProhibitionist-Verbotenist 1919,”7 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt633] an importanttext on the commonsense value of Crowleyan liberty. He coined the idea that theProhibitionist was none other than the repressive Prussian militarist in newguise. If you thought you had won the war, bud, look what’s under your own nose!The one who insists that this or that practice ist verboten! is revealed as oneunable to square up to the challenge of life, reliant on, and instrumental in,widespread repression. The real Verbotenist, it turned out, was an honest-to-GodAmerican! Crowley analyzed the psychology of the typical repressed-repressor, atype we see forever attempting to control us through the media, police, pulpit,or any other inlet or outlet open to the upturned snout of professionalbusybodies and ideological fanatics. One can well imagine Crowley’s response tothe “P.C.” brigades!Crowley begins his broadside with a consideration of how body and mind interact.The practical issue to which I propose to call attention in this paper is that aman’s opinions reflect his physical constitution. They are not based on abstractideals of justice, except in the case of exceptionally first-class men who haveno weak spots in their organization, and have in addition practised thephilosophical act of detachment.Crowley explains with great clarity the folly of misplaced humanitarian-ism, howbeliefs about equality and fairness are not only used as a cover for weaknessand fear, but are also imposed on situations where consideration of such issues,however desirable in principle, becomes utterly ruinous.If an anarchist challenges my right to my property, I reply that the Law is onmy side, and that the police and the army and navy are ready to defend me withtheir lives. If he makes a successful revolution, it is through the failure ofthe physical forces on my side; and he in his time will be compelled toestablish similar forces to defend his opinions. In other words, he will make anew Law. But no amount of fine talk will enable him to contract out of the Lawof Physical Force.If all men were converted suddenly to “humanitarian” principles, how long wouldit be before the race was swept from the planet by some no longer checkedspecies of wild animal such as the wolf or even the rat with his fearful weapon,the Plague?Now the first condition of Liberty (as we are told) is eternal vigilance, but wemust add: readiness to fight for the rights we have won. But if we fight onlyfor those rights that we ourselves value, we shall be split up into 100 sects.We must therefore fight for the people’s rights as for our own. The strong mancan do this; the weak man, selfish and short-sighted, can never put the generalwelfare before his own, or even weigh the concerns of mankind, the testimony ofhistory, the opinions and practice of the best men with his fad.What then are the rights for which we must fight? Life, liberty, and the pursuitof happiness. We are then to see to it that no man deprives us of these things;if we are citizens of the American Republic we accept this duty as a primecondition of our citizenship.. . . All this is true; but at present there is such terrible danger of itsbeing forgotten that it may as well be repealed.One of the worst defects of civilization is that the excretory system of Natureceases to function. Society today is clogged with faecal matter, because theweakling does not die. He is not cast out, but remains to infect us.We have made mere living progressively easier, and the result is that mostpeople would be better dead. They live, but without being equal to life, joyous,conquerors of Nature; and all they can do is to complain.They do not even believe in strength and beauty any more; they have persuadedthemselves that all men are weak and ugly as they are themselves. They feeltheir inferiority so acutely that they are forced to invent a morality—theslave-morality of Nietzsche—and they gnash their teeth to see that the real men,the people who are functioning as they themselves cannot do, laugh at theirpretensions.You remember Aesop’s Fable of the Fox who had lost his tail, and tried topersuade the other foxes that it was a great advantage? But nowadays that fox isfoxier; he tries to get a law passed prohibiting tails. The whole structure ofcivilization is being levelled to the ground by the efforts of the“persecutor-persecuted” type of neurotic. To put one brick upon another is sounfair and cruel to the lower brick: that is the theory to which we are supposedto subscribe in the name of Democracy. It is unfair to the rest of men to claima woman’s love for oneself alone: that is modern “Altruistic Morality.” Allaptitudes are to be condemned; we must not ride in an automobile, while thereare still those who cannot afford it and we must not walk, because it makes thepoor cripples feel bad about it.I have dealt with this theory in the most general terms, for it is theory thatis responsible. But there is a particular and imminent case of the mania of the“persecutor-persecuted” which has already endangered a great part of theliberties of the people, and threatens worse things yet.8[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt634] [draft, unfinished, ends here]Does this not have validity today, perhaps as much as when Leah Hirsig wrote itdown in an exercise book nearly a century ago? Have we learned the lesson?Within a few years, Crowley himself was to become prime target for the“persecutor-persecuted.” He refused to react to it; 666 was the number of a man:he would be no “martyr,” claiming extraordinary “rights.”We do not know if it was the imminence of Prohibition that sealed Crowley’sdecision to leave America, or whether it was simply a result of an achingfatigue. He was thirty-nine when he arrived in the United States; he was nowforty-four. The mind of Western Europe was stirring. The old order had crumbledand was crumbling still. Crowley wanted to be where the action was. On November5, 1919, perhaps regretting her lover’s imminent departure, Leah wrote to him,“I loved you all the while I was with you. I’ve loved you since you left me—Ilove you now in spite of stupid stories &c. more than ever.”The “stupid stories” could refer to anything from jealousy over his relationswith other women—Helen Hollis or Bertha Bruce—to stories of wickedness andespionage.It is poignant that the man who remembered seeing Crowley mount the gangplank ofthe Lapland, bound for England in December 1919, was Hereward Carrington, anintroduction to whom Everard Feilding had given Crowley before his departure forNew York in October 1914, more than five hard years before. In later days,Carrington would remember introducing Crowley to Leah Hirsig, whom he describedas “an extreme nymphomaniac,” as well as participating in magical ceremonieswith Crowley and Seabrook.Carrington considered Crowley’s mission for Thelema in America a failure,something for which the Beast was largely responsible. At the time, Crowley’sriposte, delivered when boarding the ship that would take him from Americaforever was, “Well, what can you expect of a country that accepts Ella WheelerWilcox as its greatest poet!”9 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt635] Five years later,Crowley accepted his failure. “I was simply too young, ignorant, and bigoted tomake any impression on the United States.”10 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt636]Before becoming head of the Bureau of Investigation’s new General IntelligenceDivision in August 1919, J. Edgar Hoover (1895–1972) had run the Department ofJustice’s Alien Enemy Bureau, charged with arresting and jailing disloyalforeigners. Hoover’s new role in the General Intelligence Division, known as the“Radical Division,” specialized in arrest, punishment, jailing, and deportationof those whose political views were deemed dangerous by the bureau. This was thetime of the first “Red Scares,” and targets included Emma Goldman, AlexanderBerkman, and Marcus Garvey, among many other communists and black militants. OnFriday night, January 2, 1920, B.I. agents with local police assistance arrestedten thousand alleged “members” of the Communist and Communist Labor Parties inraids across the United States. Many were arrested for having attended quitelawful political gatherings that Hoover and his colleagues consideredsubversive.11 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt637]Five days after the raids, on January 7, 1920, F. E. Haynes at Washington’sDepartment of Justice composed a “Memorandum” for “Mr. Hoover” on “Aleister St.Edward Crowley.”12 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt638] Its contents were exclusivelydrawn from the letter Freemason Joseph Norwood sent to the department in June1919 (see here [9781620556313_c34.xhtml#p605]), which accused Crowley ofradicalism and included a quote from Crowley claiming employment by the SecretService, and, above all, the memorandum was composed from material collected byagent Frank X. O’Donnell in July and October that year, including Crowley’s twoexaminations by the New York State attorney general in July and October, 1918,revealed in chapter 34.The new “Memorandum” for Hoover placed emphasis on Crowley’s relationship withTheodor Reuss, who “left England with the German Ambassador on England’sentrance into the European War.”13 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt639] Its threepages conclude with a statement from “the British Military Intelligence on July8, 1919,” regarding Crowley’s Statue of Liberty stunt, where Crowley is reportedto have claimed that he would “fight to the last drop of his blood for Ireland.”As O’Donnell described this source, it is likely it came out of the British WarMission, either in Washington or, most likely, New York, and that a skepticalFrederick Hall had a hand in it somewhere (see here[9781620556313_c28.xhtml#p491]). In the context of the other snippets, “Mr.Hoover” could hardly reach any conclusion but that Crowley was very likely aradical, certainly worthy of suspicion. The only caveat was that Crowley“explained his alleged connections with the British Secret Service by statingthat he had attempted to join the service but never succeeded in obtaining anofficial position with them. He states throughout his communications for aposition he dealt with Commodore Gaunt of the British Intelligence Office.(O’Donnell—July 19, 1919).”14 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt640]Three weeks later, on January 30, 1920, W. L. Hurley who worked in the office ofthe Secretary of State, Robert Lansing, wrote to Frank Burke at the Bureau ofInvestigation, Department of Justice, Washington, D.C. (Burke had beeninstrumental in the busting of Dr. Albert and his subversion of the Americanpress in summer, 1915; see here [9781620556313_c17.xhtml#p318]). Well up on hissubject, Burke had just written the Bureau of Investigation’s “Outline for theInterrogation of Radical Aliens and Instructions for Its Use,” which includedhelpful guidance to interrogators, such as “Do not frame the questions in such away as to suggest untruthful answers. For example, do not say at first ‘Are youa member of the Communist Party?, etc.’ but rather ‘When did you join theCommunist Party?’ or ‘What did you do with your membership card?’”15[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt641]—wherein we see the genesis of language employedin the notorious McCarthy “Un-American Activities” investigations of the 1940sand early 1950s. Hurley’s letter to Burke reads as follows:Dear Mr. Burke,It is my understanding that Alastarr [sic] Crowley, known to you as a pro-Germanpropagandist and Irish agitator has the intention of returning to England. Ihave been informed that the British authorities have conveyed to Crowley anintimation that if he returns to England, his reception will be rather more warmthan cordial and that it would probably be safer for him to remain on this sidefor the present.

First, that Crowley’s works hadbeen disseminated widely in America in certain circles by the late 1920s, andsecond, that for Orson to paint his loathed grandmother as a witch, or “blackmagician,” only required suggesting the influence of “the evil works of thediabolist Aleister Crowley.”2 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt644]Kenosha is only about 50 miles due north of Chicago, where C. S. Jones and C. F.Russell actively promoted Crowley’s works after the two Thelemites went sour onDetroit toward the end of 1919 and early 1920 amid ill-will from Detroit’sScottish Rite Masons.Crowley’s works spread as much through hostile reaction to them as by activepromotion. It will be noted too that especially after the Detroit debacle, whichreached the local press in 1922, Crowley’s work was practically alwaysassociated with words like cult, with all the shadows of secret societycorruption thrown in, its supposed anti-Christian wickedness taken as read.Anyone associated with it was expected to be on the defensive. This from theDetroit Times of January 10, 1922, the beginning of a press circus that gotdarker and darker with hullabulloo about priestesses, drug-filled orgies, andeventually, when the inflammatory fuss reached a Hollywood allegedly corruptedby the arrival of The Equinox amid moviestar mansions—murder.BUSINESS WRECKED, FRIENDS LOST, RYERSON WROTE TO COMPILER OF “EQUINOX”Marketing of literature furnished by Aleister Crowley, compiler of the Equinoxand endorsement of Crowley personally, caused all the troubles of Albert W.Ryerson, manager and organizer of the Universal Book Stores, Inc., according toa letter written by Ryerson to Crowley, June 6, 1919.The letter was introduced in evidence at the hearing in bankruptcy proceedingsbefore George Marston, referee in bankruptcy, by Grover L. Morden, attorney forthe creditors of the company, Monday afternoon.His family and friends had practically been alienated and his businessdestroyed, Ryerson told Crowley. Opposition of minority stock-holders of thecompany had been aroused, which threatened to put the business in the hands ofreceivers if Crowley carried out his threatened legal action to get money duehim for furnishing the book store with literature, the letter continued.Ryerson ProtestsMr. Ryerson protested that the letter was unfair, if read by itself, and thatMr. Crowley’s reply should be considered in conjunction with it. Mr. Mordenpromised to allow the letter to be introduced without objection at the nexthearing, scheduled for Jan. 20 at 2:00 p.m.Previous hearings have indicated that the Equinox, an exotic publication, causedthe upheaval which disrupted the directorate of the bookstore.The Equinox, Mr. Morden contends, is the official organ of a cult calling itselfthe O.T.O., and some of its alleged activities came up for discussion Monday.The advisability of establishing a chapter of the cult here was discussed byseven Detroiters, Mr. Ryerson admitted, after the purchase of several hundredcopies of the Equinox had practically been agreed on. This was in November,1918.Because of the “mess in the press,” Ryerson said, he would not give the names ofthe seven Detroiters, to save them from suffering as he had. These seveninsisted on some changes of the ritual which conflicted with the ritual ofsecret organization they were members of and to which women could not belong, hesaid.Later four of the men got together at the D.A.C. [Detroit Athletic Club] to forma Supreme Grand Council, Mr. Ryerson said. Dr. Gordon W. Hill, secretary of thebook company, and himself were not invited.Quarrel Follows“It was charged afterwards that some one wanted to be the ‘supreme grand cheese’of the organization,” Mr. Ryerson said, laughing. Later a quarrel broke outbetween Dr. Hill and Crowley and Dr. Hill tried to cancel the order for booksplaced with Crowley.Organization of the O.T.O. was not carried on, Mr. Ryerson insisted. No one wasinitiated and no dues were paid.“Did you know that Crowley and Sylvester Viereck, editor of Vaterland, [sic,Fatherland] were friends?” asked Mr. Morden. The Vaterland was the pro-Germanpublication in New York that caused much discussion before America entered thewar.Mr. Ryerson admitted that he knew of Crowley’s connection with Viereck. “Crowleyreally was a secret services man for Great Britain, in the war,” he explained.“German spies were continually after him. He played a slick trick on the Germansby having himself, a British spy, on their publication, He practically destroyedthe Vaterland.”Among the letters introduced by Mr. Morden was one addressed to Ryerson byCrowley and dated Oct. 2, 1918. It began with the salutation, “Dear Sir andBrother,” which Ryerson said was a reference to another fraternity. This wasfollowed by “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law,” which appears inalmost all of Crowley’s letters to the book dealer. “I have entered into acertain silence,” is the next sentence, followed by “Love is the law, love underthe will.” The letter closed with the following: “Fraternally, Aleister Crowley,666.”University CourseIn another letter Crowley tells Ryerson of plans to establish a universitycourse in connection with the establishment of the cult, “with diplomas and allthe rest of the humbug.” This was a bit of facetiousness on Mr. Crowley’s part,Mr. Ryerson said.In a letter dated March 6, 1919, Mr. Crowley’s facetiousness broke out at thevery opening of the letter, where appears:“Cheer up, little bookstore,Don’t you cry;You will be a barroomBye and bye, where the Right Wine of Iacchus will be dispensed.”Prohibition is coming, the letter states. “I am in conference with some peoplethis afternoon about a Mystic Tea Shop, and propose to add a booksellingfeature: it is not a bad combination, in view of the closing of the saloons,”Mr. Crowley wrote.In a letter to Crowley, March 4, 1919, Mr. Ryerson wrote: “Our paths liefurther.” And further: “Our work is stirring up the opposition of the churches.”We have secret information that a $5,000 loan that was promised us has beenblocked by one of our enemies.It was the intention, Mr. Ryerson wrote, to increase the stock to $50,000. Mr.Crowley is asked to invest and get his friends to do likewise.Pamphlet IntroducedMr. Ryerson recognized a little pamphlet as one which was used to advertise theEquinox. It gives the contents of the various chapters in the unintelligibleterms of the cult, and contains a reference to Mr. Crowley as the “SymbolicPantacle of the Universe.”Mr. Ryerson testified that the first contact with Crowley for the books wasdrawn up in the office of Frank T. Lodge. It was signed there by Crowley. Thecontract was to be signed later by other members of the book company. Dr. Hillobjected to Mr. Lodge’s part in the proceedings and another contract was drawnin the office of Clarence Hill, he said.Mr. Ryerson, in a sketch of his career, said he was reared in a home adjoiningthat of Ralph Waldo Emerson and that he came in contact with a school ofphilosophy there. It was the philosophic atmosphere he was reared in whichdetermined his later career, Mr. Ryerson said. He referred to the membership ofvarious groups which had been labeled “love cults,” and said their membershipincluded only the best people.“Because of the leprous press, these fine people have to go in hiding when theyhold their meetings,” he said.image [images/img_002.jpg]In Prohibition America the popular press enjoyed pandering to the prejudice thatthe movie colony flouted restrictions on alcohol and was itself a cauldron ofsin poisoning the morals of the world. Blame Crowley and the O.T.O.!Only a month after the relatively measured, if obviously biased account above,the Detroit Times got well onto the bandwagon of moral outrage.BOOK SENT TO MOVIE COLONYRitual of Detroit Love Cult Was Mailed to HollywoodThe possibility of the sinister influence of the O.T.O. underlying the mysteryof the murder of William Desmond Taylor developed today when it was discoveredthat many copies of the Equinox had circulated among the movie folk ofHollywood.Grover L. Morden, counsel for the complainant to the bankruptcy proceedings ofthe Universal Book Stores, Inc., in which the O.T.O. is the principal factor,said that a copy of the Equinox had been mailed to the wife of a prominentmoving picture director in Hollywood some time ago, and it was known many othercopies had been shipped to the movie colony.It is possible that the order has obtained a foothold in the picture colony andcolor is lent this theory by the frequent occurrence of alleged drug orgiesamong the movie stars.Drugs Play PartDrugs and their indulgence play an important part in the ritual of the O.T.O.,especially “hashish,” the exotic drug of the Orient. This combines the twotheories of Craig Kennedy. He said, “Women or drugs.” The O.T.O. combines both.Hashish is a drug much used by voluptuaries of the far east and its evilinfluence, may have been the moving impulse in the crime. Some drug crazedmaniac or jealous woman of the O.T.O. may have been Taylor’s mysteriousassailant, believes Morden.One contributing factor to the belief that Taylor may have been an active memberof the O.T.O. is his power to attract women. Adepts in the rites of the O.T.O.are usually surrounded by many woman adherents.Warning comes from Mr. Morden that the next O.T.O. scandal, and possibly another“sex crime” may come out of Chicago. “Chicago is now ripe for the organizationof another branch of the O.T.O.,” says Mr. Morden. “That city has been cryingfor copies of the Equinox. The groundwork is usually prepared by AleisterCrowley’s lieutenant and when the preliminary work is completed and a footholdgained the “Master” follows to complete the work with his lectures and thedistribution of the Equinox.Needless to say, once this first wave of vituperative disapprobation receivedfresh impetus from appalling personal attacks on Crowley by James Douglas,editor of Britain’s Sunday Express who condemned Crowley’s 1922 novel The Diaryof a Drug Fiend as an incitement to drug use, whereas the novel advocatedThelema as the philosophical basis for curing drug dependency—the jury ofpopular world opinion was well and truly nobbled; indeed, things gotconsiderably worse from there.So, the first aspect of Crowley’s legacy in America is obviously his reputation.This was not something he left himself by choice, but something laid on him by asensationalist press, and the attacks of personal enemies, against a man withoutproper means to defend himself in court against wealthy newspapers.It is always a striking feature of undertaking scholarly research into Crowley’sreal legacy—his written works, published and (largely) unpublished—to find thatthe gory picture generated in hostile press reports over the past century or so,which persist despite scholarly standards having been established on the matter,is simply alien to the man and his writing. You look for it perhaps, and you donot find it. Of course, the Grand Inquisitor can twist anything and everythingto suit the case. “He aspires to God”—you mean he worships the Devil; heexperiments with entheogens to determine the nature of consciousness; he is adrug addict. He enjoys sex and practices it as a sacred, potentially magicalpower; he is a libertine sex maniac. And so on. He was not a Christian! True,but he admired the figure so often obscured behind Christian mythology, andbelieved Thelema incorporated the fruit of Jesus’s original spiritual teachingin a fresh synthesis. Besides, the Crowley legend had things in common with thegospel figure.Jesus had considerable dialogue with Satan and was accused of getting his powertherefrom; he was counted among sinners and rejected of men. He was also accusedof consorting with prostitutes and condemned for unusual attitudes to women. “Yeare gods,” he is reported to have said (John 10:32–36), quoting scripture, whenanswering the accusation of blasphemy. But we can all find a text to suit, can’twe?Crowley underestimated the sheer power of stupidity, partly because he trulybelieved, as his father taught him from the thoughts of Saint Paul, that forthose who love God, all things work to the good (Romans 8:28). People may putobstacles before the work of God, but His great army marches on. As IsraelRegardie once wrote, Crowley was “God-intoxicated.” In those terms I suppose hemight be accused of being a God addict. His “God” was, according to sometimepupil and preserver of most of his manuscripts Gerald Yorke, the Brahman of theVedantists, seen in Qabalistic terms as the three Negative states behind“Kether” (Ain, Ain Soph, and Ain Soph Aur). In Yorke’s analysis, Crowley praisedthe Demiurge, or Creator God, and the “Devil” equally, and respected both with aview first to identify with them, and then to transcending both of them. “He iscaricatured,” wrote Yorke, “if his Antichrist or the Devil side of the equationis so stressed that the other side is lost sight of.”3[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt645] Crowley’s most successful first biographer, JohnSymonds, whose The Great Beast (1951) served as template for myriad twistedaccounts that followed, caricatured Crowley because Symonds could only see thedark side and knew there were more sales in sensation than truth.In fact, Crowley’s actions on returning to England offer clear indication of hispriorities. Crossing England without hindrance, he spent a jolly old-fashionedChristmas with old port, brandy, roast beef, and plum pudding with his favoriteaunt Annie in Croydon (she who had been interviewed by Scotland Yard as to hernephew’s whereabouts) and brought the new year of 1920 in with meetings with oldfriends like Chelsea hostess Gwendoline Otter, Mary d’Este, EverardFeilding—through whom Crowley still hoped his contribution to the war effortmight get him a “government job”4 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt646]—and withRaymond Radclyffe, whose war loan concerns probably launched the Beast toAmerica in 1914 in the first place. Crowley would write to Radclyffe from Tunisafter the 1922 publication of Diary of a Drug Fiend.My dear Radclyffe,I have just received a copy of the review you were kind enough to write in theN.W. [a favorable review in the New Witness] about my D.F. [Diary of a DrugFiend] It gave me the greatest pleasure and encouragement at a time of thegreatest distress and anxiety. Believe me I shall never forget the constantkindness which you have shown me. Your faith in my genius has done more thanperhaps you imagine to help me plug along.I am just back from ten weeks in the desert. Peace encompassed my Soul and lightinformed it.5 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt647]Crowley met the distinguished Everard Feilding in Paris on January 11 andcautiously sought his help. We do not know what, if anything, came of themeeting. Crowley hoped the public ambiguity of his position as regards Germanycould be of use to the government, that is, he could attract attention ofBritain’s enemies who thought him Britain’s enemy too. That is the reason hegave for not publishing an account of his service to the Allied cause (“The LastStraw”), stimulated by intense outrage at John Bull ’s story “Another TraitorTrounced—Career and Condemnation of the notorious Aleister Crowley,” publishedin England the day before meeting Feilding.It might strike those who thought there was something in gossip concerningCrowley’s notoriety to see that his thinking time during the period before andafter leaving America was devoted to what in one document he called “the Problemduring this Aeon, of the government and guidance of mankind.” He made notes onthe problem of the state of the world after World War I and what could be done.This was the work of the Magus. 1. The need of a “Brain” or Ruach*199 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft199] for the planet 2. Analysis of the need: Excessive intercomplication 3. Magickal Kingship the only solution 4. Its real service to “the people”Crowley further elaborates on the above:1. General loss of sanity—and wisdom. “Planet” is for the first time in recordedhistory, to all intents and purposes, brainless.2. . . . It is quite clear that another general war in the near future wouldthrow all the Western nations into anarchy, chaos, and reversion to savagery. Onthe other hand, the world is quite clearly heading for such a war, and no powerat present in force can avert it.6 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt648]Crowley’s reputation worsened considerably from 1922 to 1923 and, it could beargued, is still out of line with the evidence.Cecil Frederick Russell, who came to Crowley with a plaintive desire forinitiation in 1918, learned everything he could about him and his teachings,became an intimate at 63 Washington Square, and visited him at Cefalù, Sicily,where Crowley established himself in 1920, eventually sold out his friendshipwith the Beast. Never one to miss a trick, Russell decided to beat Bill Seabrookto the post by selling his own story to Morrill Goddard, Sunday editor of thelowbrow New York American Journal. Having established his version of the Beast’steachings in Chicago, calling it the “Choronzon Club,” Russell contactedGoddard, on September 25, 1922, and filled a long letter with all he knew aboutCrowley and his friends. He offered eight articles, spilling the beans onCrowley’s homosexuality, naming names, and all for $100 per article.7[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt649] As far as I am aware, Goddard disdained topublish, per-haps concerned at the implications for slander and libel suitsbased on of character assassinations coming from a single related source.It is noteworthy that Russell chose a lowbrow publication to disgorge thecontents of his poisoned pen, for that has been the principal mode ofinformation transport on Crowley ever since. As Crowley himself observed, nohighbrow journal in his lifetime ever dipped to the gutter level and condemnedhim or his ideas outright. However, the lowbrow story is the one that got aboutand over course of time established itself as the universal legacy of Crowley’slife. Tried by gutter press, more responsible journals have been loth to pick upanything serious about the real man. The result has been that he has beenartificially severed from his place in the continuum of cultural andphilosophical history, an eternal “outsider,” condemned in absentia.Crowley’s “friend” Bill Seabrook added fuel to the flames in 1923. We havealready seen his account of Crowley and Engers in “Astounding Secrets of theDevil-Worshippers’ Mystic Love Cult” published on April 8, 1923, in the UnitedStates (see here [9781620556313_c33.xhtml#p601]). That was only chapter 2 of aseries of twelve. The timing could not have been worse.In February 1923, Crowley’s pupil, Oxford graduate and magical enthusiastFrederick Charles (“Raoul”) Loveday, died after accidentally drinkingbacteria-laden stream water, despite Crowley’s warning not to touch it. Thisevent initiated a storm of headlines and articles that ran through the SundayExpress and John Bull like a fever from March to May, with John Bull coining thephrase “the wickedest man in the world” (March 24, 1923), taking Crowley’snickname, “the Beast,” at face value as indicating an immoral cannibal. Such wasthe persistent clamor that, on April 23, Crowley was served a deportation orderfrom Italian soil at Palermo, by order of fascist dictator Mussolini, alreadyanxious about Freemasons, spies, and foreign journalists in Italy.Leaving his family (Leah and Crowley’s daughter Astarte Lulu, Leah’s son Hansi,Ninette Fraux, and her son Howard) behind, expecting to be vindicated andreunited with them, a penniless, persecuted Crowley crossed the Mediterraneanfor Tunis. There he began a long process of appeals for a fair hearing thatnever came. It is interesting with regard to the legacy issue how Crowley triedto deal with his reputation as propounded by William B. Seabrook’s twelvesensationalist articles.On August 1, 1923, Crowley, financially sustained by Aimage[images/dots.jpg]Aimage [images/dots.jpg] brother Norman Mudd, wrote from theTunisia Palace Hotel to U.S. tour promoter Arnold Shaw, proposing a lecture tourof the USA.Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the lawIt’s been a long time since you heard of me. Like Byron, I woke up and foundmyself famous. What contracts do you propose to offer me? Any arrangement wouldinclude prepayment* [9781620556313_c36.xhtml#ft206] of the travelling expensesof myself and a secretary and a substantial guarantee of the tour.I think I had better leave it to you to feel the pulse of the public with regardto the actual subjects of the lectures. As you know, I am familiar with everybranch of Occult Science, and can suit myself to any conceivable audience.Love is the law, love under will.* [9781620556313_c36.xhtml#fr206]In case you do not know how famous I am, Irefer you to the recent SERIES of 12 double-page feature stories by William B.Seabrook of the International Feature Syndicate which have attained publicity aswide as their statements are fabulous [meaning = fables; nonsense]. I am quitesure that the wild and woolly will put down any imaginable percentage of theirdirty dollars to see and hear in the flesh the original of so many sensationalfalsehoods. In fact I do not propose to accept any figure notably inferior tothat of my dear friend Powys [John Cowper Powys], to whom please give my lovewhen you next see him.8 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt650]It is interesting to see Crowley trying to turn the awful publicity around bycapitalizing on the notoriety while desiring to put the record straight as tothe truth of what he stood for. He also wrote to New York agent Major J. B.Pond, who had handled Winston Churchill’s public tour arrangements when Crowleywas in New York the first time in 1900.Crowley then turned his attention to the “culprit,” Bill Seabrook, who, havingprobably first mooted his intended piece as a respectful one, had persuadedCrowley to lend him materials, only for Crowley to see the results whipped intothe general tempest of anti-Crowley “revelations.”Dear Bill,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.Lots of talk about you here.Question is—have you played a straight hand?You must have made a great deal of money in the serial; and you must pay me 50%.You cried “Trust me,” and I trusted you. I haven’t had a cent from you bar the$50 necessary to collect and mail you the material.(You have not returned it either; do so at once.)9[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt651]That Crowley was able to rise above his troubles and accept them in stoic spiritwas always a remarkable feature of his iron tenacity in the face of calumnyafter calumny, and the results of his own follies. This comes through clearly ina letter of the same period he sent to the author James Branch Cabell(1879–1958), whose novel Jurgen, A Comedy of Justice (1919) contained lines fromCrowley’s Gnostic Mass and was a book Crowley himself hugely admired. Cabell’sbook had led to an obscenity trial, so he was writing to a fellow sufferer whotold things as they appeared to him to be.Tunisia Palace Hotel, Tunis4 September 1923Dear Mr Cabell,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.It never struck me how strange an animal I am till these memoirs supplied aMagical Mirror.*200 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft200] The truth is far strangerthan fiction, as somebody once had the perspicacity to remark.

Aleister CrowleyP.S. I am really eager that you should understand my point of view, andeventually wake up the world to the superb destiny which lies beneath thesuperficial sorrow and futility which form the tragedy of your Epic. You mustn’tleave mankind paralyzed by the apparent impossibility of attainment. A.C.10[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt652]Aleister Crowley had little choice but to tolerate low brow publicity, thinkinghe could turn it around to serve the cause. He was wrong. On the other hand, itdid mean that in the future recruits to Thelema really did have to have minds oftheir own to penetrate the dirty smoke screen, intuiting that there really wassomething going on à la Crowley. And these people—being individuals—came, andstill come, from all classes of strivers on this planet, despite carps that theymight better belong to another one.THE O.T.O. IN AMERICACrowley’s second American legacy must be the O.T.O. Ah! You could write a goodlong book about the survival of Crowley’s O.T.O. in the United States—and indeedthere are two very good works on the subject to which I can refer you withconfidence, though neither tell the complete story. Martin P. Starr’s TheUnknown God: W. T. Smith and the Thelemites takes a sympathetic but no lessrigorous interest in long-suffering Englishman Wilfred Talbot Smith (1885–1957),Jones’s deputy in Vancouver, who oversaw a long and troubled—indeed oftenpainful—history of devotion to the Beast and his teachings in California, evenwhen Crowley turned his back on him. Starr’s detailed study ends with Smith’sdeath in 1957, when the O.T.O. was headed by Crowley’s successor and old friendKarl Germer. Germer died in 1962 without naming a new outer head of the Order.How the North American O.T.O. emerged from the long hiatus between that time andthe assumption of headship according to Crowley’s principles of theextraordinary Major Grady Louis McMurtry (1918–1985) between 1969 and 1971, whenunder McMurtry’s aegis a freshly legal O.T.O. began performing initiationsagain, is told from the point of view of personal memoir in James Wasserman’s Inthe Center of the Fire: A Memoir of the Occult 1966–1989. Wasserman’s is one ofthe most important memoirs of the 1960s and post-’60s American spiritualawakening, with the expected “adult dose” of sex, drugs, and rock ’n’ roll.According to prevailing folk wisdom of course, if he had been there, heshouldn’t have been able to remember it! Ever wondered why the Gospels are soshort? As a survivor, Wasserman tells an inspiring story of not always inspiringhappenings: heroes, heroines, heroin, wives, lovers, bums—you name it!THE CHURCH OF THELEMABy 1922, O.T.O. lodge work in Vancouver had come to a standstill. Smith missedJones, who couldn’t afford to get himself out of Chicago or his burgeoninginterest in the latest esoteric scam, the “U.B.” (or Universal Brotherhood) thatmangled brains with absurd language and wanton neologisms; Jones should haveknown better but was laboring under many delusions, chief of which was that hehad gained superior insights to Crowley’s. Meanwhile, Outer Head of the OrderTheodor Reuss, trying to undermine Crowley, sent Jones a charter granting Jonesrights as head of the O.T.O. in North America. This was intended by Reuss tocurry favor with AMORC founder H. Spencer Lewis with whom Reuss hoped to form afinancially advantageous alliance. Lewis didn’t trust Crowley—Crowley knewLewis’s weak spots.On August 28, 1922, Lewis calumniated Crowley. In a Q&A session, attended byRuby Jones, Lewis was asked if AMORC had anything to do with the O.T.O., bearingin mind the Hearst papers’ attack on it. Lewis replied, “If you mean thatfilthy, immoral outfit run by Crowley and Jones etc., etc.”11[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt653] Ruby stuck up for the O.T.O. and told Lewis hewas objectionable. Needless to say, while Reuss’s move to “get Crowley out ofAmerica” did not make Lewis look any more kindly on Reuss and the O.T.O., it didgive Jones reason to take himself seriously, rendering him even more prone toimagine himself inspired.All this made Smith very worried. Added to worries about Jones and the U.B.,Smith now heard C. F. Russell had stepped beyond the bonds of brotherhood.Crowley wrote to Smith about the problem on March 14, 1922: “Russell is a reallydangerous lunatic capable of murder.”12 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt654] OnApril 21, Smith, having quit British Columbia, found employment as adjuster inthe South California Gas Company’s Customer Department, which company employedSmith for some twenty years.Reuss died on October 28, 1923, while Crowley waxed and waned in North Africa.Both Jones and neo-Rosicrucian German bookseller Heinrich Tränker had receivedX° charters from Reuss, making them O.T.O. heads. They both agreed to acceptCrowley’s claim that Reuss made him successor as O.H.O. What Crowley in himselfmeant by that was that Reuss had made Crowley take control of the Order, byReuss’s hostile attitude to Thelema, not by grant! Crowley had an ambivalentattitude to titles, and when it came to it, Excalibur belonged to the one thestone yielded to.image [images/9781620556313_090.jpg]Fig. 36.1. Aleister Crowley at large, 1929Despite Jones’s support from Chicago over the O.T.O. headship, relationsworsened between them over interpretations of Thelema and the magical traditiongenerally, with Crowley thinking that Jones was actually insane. In 1925 theyceased communicating, a hiatus lasting until 1936, when there was a briefrapprochement.Smith, in California, kept in touch with Crowley and Jones, remaining devoted tothe Thelemic gospel and hoping things might yet improve. In 1930, they did.Smith met Regina Agnes Kahl (1891–1945), a striking and approachable bisexualopera singer and voice coach. Smith was smitten and Regina—predictably nicknamed“Vagina” by Crowley—let her last lesbian lover go to devote herself to Smith,who charmed her in his simplicity, a simplicity that ever irritated Crowley, whoalways liked a rather military but intellectually subtle style in his deputies.Regina had a dramatic impact on Smith’s confidence, who felt a failure in allsorts of ways.Smith had left his wife, Kath, though was still close to son, Kwen, and, lookingback on hopeful days in Vancouver, missed Jones and smarted under Crowley’sdistance management. For his part, 666 found Smith’s letters too chatty,domestic, and full of sentimental sob stuff about who was sleeping with whom;Crowley felt his California dream could end up a Theosophical (“Toshosophical”)soft-drinks party, with a bit of a talk about Vivekananda followed by a chanceof romance with the latest arrival! Being so far away, the Beast never fullygrasped that this was California, and the disciplined English style didn’t makemuch sense in the heat and the breeze. Smith got on doing his best, and he wasvery fond of the ladies: for him that rebellion against sexual conformity waswhat a lot of Thelema was about. He couldn’t stand the sex-hating hypocriticalreligion of his childhood. And with Regina around, he got the sexual aspect ofthings going in good stride. Even courageous Thelema devotee and Cefalù veteranJane Wolfe joined in a sex-magical threesome with Smith and Regina.Born Sarah Jane Wolfe, Soror Estai (1875–1958) was a mainstay of the Thelemicpresence in America, a rock. Introduced to Crowley’s work by none other thanBetty and Sheridan Bickers, she wrote to the Beast in 1918 when earning goodmoney as a Hollywood actress, playing Mary Pickford’s mother in Rebecca ofSunnybrook Farm (1917—you can see it on YouTube). But as roles dried up,especially after the advent of the Talkie, Jane came to feel blacklisted for herreligious affiliation. The Equinox was associated with what brought down theartistically restrictive Hays Code on Hollywood’s delirious head.During autumn 1931, Smith engaged carpenters to assist in providing structureand accoutrements for a planned revival of the Gnostic Catholic Mass, theThelemites’ contribution to Californian righteousness. Big things have smallbeginnings.With Regina and Jane’s vocal skills, Smith thought he could improve on localLiberal Catholic and Roman Catholic ritual work. To house the ritual, Smith andRegina acquired a lease on 1746 Winona Boulevard, Hollywood, on May 3, 1932.This would become a successful O.T.O. “profess house” for the next decade.Regina, a wonderful entertainer, held themed parties, such as “Walt Whitman’sbirthday” and “Crowley nights” when the Beast attained spectral presence throughhis signed photograph, brought in as guest of honor.While Smith worked hard on turning an attic of thirty-six by eighteen feet intoa temple, he was wary of coming out into the open with a revived O.T.O.initiation schedule lest it bring the Hearst newspapers snooping around, everwilling to manufacture a newsworthy scandal to keep the punters titillated. Asfictional Hearst-like figure Charles Foster Kane responded in Citizen Kane tohis Cuba correspondent’s telegram, “Could provide prose poems about scenery.STOP. There is no war in Cuba! STOP.”—“You provide the prose poems; I’ll providethe war.”In 1932, with Regina doing her own ritual based on Crowley’s Liber Astarte velBerylli, she became convinced a revived O.T.O. program should be swiftlyinaugurated. Jane informed imminent arrivals from Missouri, Max and thestunningly beautiful Leota Schneider, about forthcoming developments now the newtemple was ready. Max and Leota, with son Roland, joined the Thelemic householdon February 3, 1933. Max’s ability to make jewelery did little to help strainedfinances. The “profess house” was supposed to be run on quasi-monastic orcommunistic lines with pooling of resources, but as always happens whennecessity is voluntary, volunteers are necessary.Natural portents presaged the first performance of the Gnostic Mass at 1746Winona Boulevard. The Long Beach earthquake struck 6.4 on the Richter scale whenit shook the vicinity on March 10, 1933, at 5:55 p.m. Nine days later, a Sunday,at noon, the first mass was performed, with Wilfred Smith as priest; Regina Kahlas priestess; Oliver Jacobi as deacon; with a congregation made up of Leota,Max, and Roland Schneider; Dr. George Liebling (1865–1946) and his wife, Alice;Olita Lunt Draper (1876–1945); Viola Morgan, John Bamber; Jane Wolfe; Mary K.Wolfe; and Jack Ross on organ. Jack Ross would be entrapped by a police antigaysting, and Harry Hay took up the ivories in his place with works by Satie,Richard Strauss, Wagner, Bax, and himself: a fine addition. A feast and ceremonyof the Equinox followed the service at 5:43 p.m., when Frater VOVN (Smith)banged his new Zildjian gong, calling all present to sup a toast to the MasterTherion, their absent friend.When Crowley saw the photographs of the temple, he declared himself “pleasedbeyond measure,” though he would be less impressed when he saw pictures of theprincipals in their costumes, Smith particularly. Crowley persistentlymisinterpreted things that were happening at 1746. For example, he thought thatthe hundred or so persons that might come to Regina’s social events alsoattended services. Things were aggravated considerably when Crowley let MaxSchneider be his intermediary. Max began complaining regularly to Crowley aboutSmith, who had little initiative, it was true, but was honest and reliable.Eventually, poor Smith couldn’t do right for doing wrong as Crowley tried tomicromanage from thousands of long miles away.One suspects Crowley might just have been suffering from envy at being stuck ina dreary, depression-hit Britain while his acolytes were in the sun. In England,Hollywood was seen as a place of pure (and impure) magic in the popular sense;Crowley, despite the fact he hadn’t been impressed by it in 1915, couldn’t helpbut feel the glamour was a bit cool by the time its rays reached him in London.He desperately wanted to be part of things, hence the urge to interfere. Hewanted to be present at the party and hold the tiller. He knew what he couldhave contributed and thought that if he was nice to Schneider, Schneider wouldraise the funds to get him over there. Max’s description of Regina and Smith’sactivities as “theatricals” raised Crowley’s hackles that Thelema was being soldlow on account of amateurishness.Max’s hostility was not without cause. Smith, his roving eye evercircumnavigating the globe of his experience, had caught the attention of thelovely Leota, and they had sex magick together. There was of course supposed tobe no jealousy in a Thelemic community. The Book of the Law made it plain that awife, if it was her True Will, might depart husband and enjoy the love of alover, husband likewise.Crowley resented the style in which Smith operated. There was something aboutSmith’s sex appetite that disgusted him. This might appear hypocritical. Part ofit was Crowley’s childishly arrogant snobbery, which, combined with leoninepride, got the upper hand from time to time. Keen judge of caste that he was,Crowley mistook Smith’s hopeless grammar, lazy diction, and spelling as signs ofplebeian origin. In fact, Smith came from the same kind of middle-classbackground as Crowley did; Smith just hadn’t been bothered much about schooling.However, if you were going to play the game of Love, in Crowley’s book, you didit artfully. Crowley felt the O.T.O. house would attract the reputation of beinga “love cult,” something he abhorred (recall the Marian Dockerill booklet thatlinked Crowley’s name to a “love cult”; that is, religion or mysticism as anexcuse for erotic gratification). In this, he was right, as we shall see.Leota Schneider had a sense of the magical; she called her rites with Smith“Unto thee Nuit,” a charming paraphrase from The Book of the Law. “Sing therapturous love-song unto me! Burn to me perfumes! Wear to me jewels! Drink tome, for I love you! I love you!” demands the goddess of infinite space inCrowley’s revelation: give one’s all to the all (AL I:63).Not only did Crowley want Max to get him back to California, he also wanted themto use contacts to make a movie of the Gnostic mass, with movie stars as priestand priestess. Of this suggestion, Leota wrote in her diary, “VOVN [Smith] ofcourse thinks this stupid, and he is right.”13 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt655]These little windows into a more involved story give us some idea of the realityan esoteric family life, lived on a different principle to that of the ordinarynonesoteric world.There is a wonderful photograph by Paul Rose Freeman of an informal gathering atWinona Boulevard with Georgia Haitz, Oliver Jacobi, Regina Kahl, Wilfred T.Smith (looking like distinguished bank manager), some unknown sportif-lookingguests, and Jane Wolfe in a long tartan dress. If this was “commune” life,communes might never have achieved such a bad name! They are smart, clean, tidy,genial, normal. In fact the spirit of the image is forward-looking, warm, andcontented, a perhaps fleeting moment when the 1930s saw, unbeknown to itself, arelaxed group of loving people who’d fled quietly from the Wizard of Oz andfound a comfortable, carpeted living room, pleasantly appointed in the glow of aCalifornian Christmas Eve. Where, one might ask, was the “force and fire” ofHorus?—in their eyes and in their hearts.From September 21, 1935, the Minerval degree was worked at Hollywood’s onlyprofess house. Smith and Regina obligated Max on August 8, giving him the firstand second degrees in rough form. Smith aimed for twelve candidates but settledfor seven. They were received into the Minerval degree in the desert about Playadel Rey (Doors, eat your heart out!), which made an intriguing return trip tothe home of Thelema in America. A banquet followed initiation. Of those whopassed through, many just passed through, transients. Some stuck.14[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt656]After inception in September 1935, the Agape Lodge, the only functioning lodgein the world under Crowley’s direction, progressed steadily with regular studyclasses, degree conferrals, lectures. “OT.O. Parties” brought a weeklycelebration of Crowley’s Gnostic mass. On May 17, 1936, mystic Paul Foster Case,founder of the Builders of the Adytum (which used to have the late MichaelBaigent, coauthor of Holy Blood, Holy Grail as a member), attended mass at 1746as a welcome visitor.Unfortunately, Max Schneider’s continual misinformation to Crowley led tocessation of lodge activity on August 27, 1936. Dormancy ensued for three years.Crowley accused Smith of sexual transactions for money and pressured Schneiderto arrange for a visit from the Beast to sort things out. Crowley was also keento sort out AMORC as well, for he knew that Lewis’s only valid document was anO.T.O. diploma given him by Reuss; Lewis’s alleged Toulouse Rosicrucian charterwas an obvious forgery. Lewis knew that the charter bases of all neo-Rosicrucianorganizations were ultimately suspect, because existing organizations had nodocumented authority going back further than the mid-eighteenth century, thoughthis was not a fact his members were made aware of. They were fed the story ofan unbroken chain of tradition (ah! Tradition) going back to the temples ofancient Egypt. Lewis had made a link with the Martinists of Paris and Lyon. Healso claimed to have made some kind of connection with the Rose-Croix from whichJoséphin Péladan claimed authority for his Order of the Temple and the Graal.But that group had no charter base either to assert a link to supposed latemedieval founder of the R+C Order, “Father CR.”*201[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft201]In 1939 the local press tried to link what Smith had incorporated as the “Churchof Thelema” with a serial killer’s attack at a school. Police swarmed on WinonaBoulevard. A Herald-Express reporter attended a Gnostic mass the day after thepolice swoop; Regina gave a warm, straightforward account of the church, legallyfounded, in the context of a European crisis where freedom of religiousexpression was being extirpated by fascist dictators. God forbid that such couldoccur in happy California! While yellow journalists referred to the group as“the Purple Cult,” Smith and the brethren participated in a radio recording,including a decent waxing of the Gnostic mass, due to be aired on Friday, March3, 1939. However, the school where the attack took place was concerned at theeffect of more publicity and begged that in the light of the fuss now dying downit would hurt the school to issue a rebuttal of claims of links between homicideand the alleged cult. There was also the likelihood that the Hearst press wasready to go to the level of linking faked nude photos mixed in with images of1746 and its members. Smith bought the discs made of the service from the radiostation for $20. More momentous events were to come, as war began in Europe andU-boats again targeted shipping in the Atlantic. In 1940, Crowley experiencedthe full force of Hitler’s Luftwaffe as bomb after bomb hit London whileCalifornians enjoyed beach life.To give the Thelemites credit, they arranged for a U.S. printing of Crowley’sliterary and symbolic “Pantacle to Win the War” called Thumbs Up! On September12, 1941, three months before the United States entered World War II, Crowley’srepresentative in New York, Karl Germer, read a telegram from 666: “Informeverybody Aleister invented V-sign for Victory.”†202[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft202] Germer and the Californian Thelemites would soonensure that a special U.S. edition of Thumbs Up! appeared in 1942. To it wasappended a typed note, indicating that Crowley’s V-campaign had now reachedAmerica.This American reprint of Aleister Crowley’s Thumbs Up! was made possible by thegenerosity and enthusiasm of a few of his many friends on this side of theAtlantic, as a contribution to the V for Victory campaign.To follow the example of the English edition, a limited number of copies havebeen made available “for Free Distribution among the Soldiers and Workers of theForces of Freedom.” Contributions to the printing of a much larger edition maybe sent to:VP.O. Box 24Hollywood, Calif.One of the technical contributors to the war for freedom was rocket engineerJack Parsons. In March 1941, 1746 Winona Boulevard witnessed his initiation andthat of his wife, Helen Parsons. Jack’s epiphany proved a seismic jolt to theHollywood Thelemites.A major figure in U.S. rocket research history, John Whiteside Parsons’s life(1914–1952) would make a fascinating American biographical movie, especially ashis great interest in science fiction now flourishes to the extent where fictionand fact meet in the computers, or through the computers, of millions around theworld.15 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt657]JACK PARSONS: ROCKET MANEstranged from a family suffering the faded glory of former wealth (lost in the1929 crash), Parsons took his scientific brilliance and love of rockets to apaid post at Caltech in 1939. A founder of both the Jet Propulsion Laboratoryand the Aerojet Engineering Corporation, Jack pioneered liquid-and solid-fuelrocket engines and invented the first castable, composite rocket propellent.Born in Chicago in 1910, Jack’s wife, Helen, née Cowley, was Olga HelenaCowley’s daughter. In July 1922, Olga remarried and moved from Chicago toPasadena in Southern California with husband, Burton Ashley Northrup. From thatmarriage Helen Parsons acquired two attractive half sisters, Sara and Nancy. AsMartin Starr observes, the profess house always provided a welcome home tobohemians and sexual outsiders, and Jack, who attended a Communist Party readinggroup once or twice (he never joined the C.P.), loved radical movements; hewanted society reformed. In this atmosphere, it is not altogether surprisingthat dashingly handsome Jack would find himself involved with Helen’s halfsister Sara, a beauty.image [images/9781620556313_091.jpg]Fig. 36.2. Happy Times: Jack Whiteside Parsons (1914–1952) and Sara Northrup(1924–1997)With America fully committed to war against the Axis powers, and rocket researcha military necessity, Jack and Helen found a superb three-story Californianmansion at 1003 South Orange Grove Avenue, on Pasadena’s “Milllionaires’ Row.”It had sixteen rooms, five bedrooms, a wine cellar, and a huge basement. Jackand Helen took out a two-year lease on June 1, 1942. Jane and Smith had theirdoubts, but Smith backed Parsons’s boundless enthusiasm with his retirementsavings of $1,200, and the Church of Thelema moved in on June 9, 1942, shortlyafter the United States defeated the Japanese by force and fire at the Battle ofMidway in the Pacific. June 9 was also Wilfred Smith’s fifty-seventh birthday,and he would live with Helen Parsons, as Jack would live conjugally with SaraElizabeth Bruce Northrup (1924–1997), Soror Cassap of the O.T.O.Paranoia was in the air. It first emanated from the East Coast, where Crowley’srepresentative Karl Germer, only freed from incarceration by the Nazis thanks tohis American wife, Sascha’s, intervention (the Gestapo accused Germer ofdisseminating the works of “High Freemason Crowley”), was subjected to F.B.I.observation. The internal security investigation began in 1941 when J. EdgarHoover was considering Crowley’s visa application to return to the UnitedStates. Hoover was suspicious of Crowley’s World War I record of espionage andwas suspicious of Crowley in general, hardly surprising given the press he’dreceived for twenty years and the information the old B.I. had provided him.Unfortunately, suspicions were compounded in Germer’s case by a letter sent tothe F.B.I. from an acquaintance of Germer’s divorced second wife, Cora. Theletter declared Germer a pro-Nazi admirer of Hitler. That was sufficient forHoover to order agents to search Germer’s New York apartment, which happened onMarch 3, 1942, an event Germer never really recovered from. On top of everythingGermer had suffered over the years for Thelema, the invasion by U.S. agents ofhis private space in his country of refuge made him exceedingly nervous,retiring, insular, and even more suspicious than he was already.As if that was not bad enough, a letter of September 7, 1942, signed “A RealSoldier” was received by the Pasadena Police Department. The letter alleged “SexPerversion” and the teaching of “Survival of the Fittest” (a Nazi doctrineallegedly) as sine qua non at 1003 S. Orange Grove Avenue. Pasadena Policepounced and interviewed Jack Parsons. The interview was shared with ArmyIntelligence. The F.B.I. showed up on January 16, 1943. Helen reckoned theagents’ questions were stupid. Smith patiently showed them around the building.Calling the object of their search the “Church of Thelma” the investigationconcluded that there was no subversion of the United States in evidence at thelocation, though it might be a religion or possibly a “love-cult,” but the pointwas made that Jack’s involvement reflected poorly on his character.Crowley too would begin to have his doubts about handsome Jack’s character,while his view of Smith hit a new low in 1945 when Crowley basically turnedagainst him. In an oblique attack, Crowley reckoned Smith had some kind ofprofound ego problem, ever refusing to see that his judgment might not always beas right as he thought it was. Crowley wanted to knock him off his secure perch,a cruel thing, but that didn’t bother him. Crowley was under the impressionSmith’s alleged weakness would wreck the lodge. His method was fairly perverse.He wrote in all apparent seriousness that it was now revealed to him what he hadhitherto failed to see, that is, that W. T. Smith was in fact the incarnation ofa god, and not just any god! Such things, wrote Crowley, were of great magnitudeand rarity in the initiatic history of the species, and it was now incumbent onSmith to make a Great Magical Retirement until through protracted meditation andself-analysis he discovered exactly who the god in question might be, and whathis message for mankind was. Until such time as he could solve the riddle of hisbeing, the other members of the lodge were to eschew his company, barnecessities.Smith didn’t find this funny at all. He had given his life to Thelema and nevercould see why Crowley did not like him addressing his letters “Dear Aleister.”Poor Smith left 1003 in the spring of 1945, finding accommodation at 1801Tamarind, Hollywood, where he settled in great misery of mind with Helen Parsonsand Kwen, his son. Crowley was dis-interested from then on.L. RON HUBBARDInto the vacuum he had left at 1003, strange things were afoot. Jack shared hisenthusiasm for the latest developments in science and psychology in the milieuof creative science fiction, a milieu frequented by Lafayette Ron Hubbard(1911–1986), born in Tilden, Nebraska, son of naval officer Harry Ross andteacher Ledora May Hubbard. Hubbard shared with Parsons an interest in themagazine Astounding Science Fiction, edited by John W. Campbell Jr., who wouldbecome a supporter of Hubbard’s innovations in psychology as they appeared inthe late 1940s, culminating in Hubbard’s Dianetics: The Modern Science of MentalHealth (1950).On May 20, 1946, the day Crowley completed his last anthology of verse, calledOlla, he received a letter about Jack Parsons sent by Louis Culling, member ofthe Pasadena church, to Karl Germer. Crowley called it an “appalling letter” inhis diary. Parsons, Crowley was told, had gone on his own magical retirement inMarch in pursuit of something he called the “Babalon Working” with new chum and“seer” L. Ron Hubbard. The aim was to incarnate an astral deity, and not justany deity, Babalon herself, apparently into a lady by the name of artistMarjorie Cameron, a striking redhead who had turned up at the house immediatelyafter Jack and Ron’s desert ceremony. Jack saw Marjorie as the fit receptacle inwhich Babalon might incarnate herself. The idea of course was central toCrowley’s fictional Simon Iff story Moonchild. It seemed to Crowley the two menwere confusing magical fact with magical fiction, or was it science fiction?For, of course, Crowley’s rubric for the original Equinox series was “The Methodof Science. The Aim of Religion”: a scientific religion and religious science.Crowley was warned that Jack’s sanity was in jeopardy. Crowley declared toGermer he became “fairly frantic” when considering “the idiocy of these goats.”Did it strike him that his own gambit with Smith might have encouraged suchnotions of gods mysteriously incarnating in California? This was the year of theatom bomb after all. Anything was possible. And still Crowley couldn’t get hiscarnal being to California, despite assistance from a friend in the S.I.S. inLondon. Was Hoover blocking procedures? If he was, he was doing a disservice toParsons’s sanity.Unfortunately, it wasn’t only Jack’s sanity that was at stake. Sara Northrupsomehow got hold of a large chunk of Jack’s considerable savings he had investedin a buy-and-sell yacht business with Hubbard (Crowley was convinced the naiveParsons was being swindled), and Sara went off with Hubbard, becoming his wifeuntil acrimonious divorce. Hubbard’s take on all this was that his contact withthe Church of Thelema was undertaken for national security purposes as theLodge, and Jack’s part in it, were under government suspicion, his actionsthereby destroying a center of black magic: a no more than plausible narrativein the circum-stances. Opinion on whether Hubbard took more from the experiencethan Jack’s girlfriend is divided.Scholar of Western Esotericism Dorthe Refslund Christensen has written, “In themid-forties, Hubbard was also very briefly in contact with Jack Parsons, thehead of Aleister Crowley’s Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.) in Pasadena. However,trivialities apart, no specific influence from Crowley can be traced inHubbard’s later teachings in terms of Scientology.”16[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt658]On the other hand, scholar Hugh Urban in his paper “The Occult Roots ofScientology? L. Ron Hubbard, Aleister Crowley, and the Origins of aControversial New Religion” has argued:In sum, it seems clear that Hubbard had a direct involvement in Parsons’s O.T.O.rituals and that there is a significant amount of Crowley’s influence in theearly Scientology beliefs and practices of the 1950s. Not only did Hubbard andCrowley share a fundamental belief in the unlimited potential of the individualself, but they also used common techniques of exteriorization of the spirit fromthe physical body, and they ultimately shared a common goal of realizing theinfinite, godlike power of the individual self. If we really look closely at thehistorical connections and the textual evidence, Crowley’s ideal of theindividual will and the unlimited power of the magus does not seem verydifferent from Hubbard’s goal of self-determinism and the realization of theinfinite power of the thetan.17 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt659]Thetan is a term coined by Hubbard to describe that aspect of the human beingthat is not conditioned by time, space, mass, or any material energy ordimension: the spiritual being, consistent with the gnostic concept of thepneuma or transmundane “spirit.”Urban does qualify his analysis by asserting that while one can theoreticallyposit a number of influences and creative stimuli of Crowley’s work on Hubbard’sdeveloping thought, his central argument “is that Crowley’s work does indeedrepresent one important influence in Hubbard’s complex system—but only oneinfluence, which was both mediated through Hubbard’s own creative religiousimagination and combined with a vast array of other religious, scientific, andliterary influences.”18 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt660]Urban quotes from Hubbard’s own writings to show that Hubbard, regardless of therole Parsons attributed to Hubbard in the Babalon Workings, showed in oneinstance respect for Crowley’s works, referring to their author as his “verygood friend.” The implication may be argued that Hubbard considered himselftaking some of the ideas Crowley brought forth from ancient tradition in hisgeneration a stage further. After all, Crowley had died in 1947; Hubbarddelivered his lecture mentioning Crowley in December 1952. As Urban puts it,“Hubbard makes it clear in this discussion that he sees a direct continuitybetween Crowley’s magical ritual and the techniques of Scientology. Both aredescribed here as practical techniques involving a specific “cycle of action”intended to produce a desired effect.The magical cults of the 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th centuries in the MiddleEast were fascinating. The only modern work that has any-thing to do with themis a trifle wild in spots, but is a fascinating work in itself, and that’s thework of Aleister Crowley—the late Aleister Crowley—my very good friend. And hedid himself a splendid piece of aesthetics built around those magical cults.It’s very interesting reading to get a hold of a copy of a book—quite rare, butit can be obtained. The Master Therion. T-h-e-r-i-o-n . . . He signs himself“The Beast.”“The Mark of the Beast, 666.” Very, very something or other.. . . Crowley exhumed a lot of the data from these old magic cults. And he, as amatter of fact, handles cause and effect quite a bit. Cause and effect ishandled according to a ritual. . . . And that ritual is what you do in order toaccomplish this or how you have to go through and how many motions you have tomake to come into the ownership of that . . . each ritual is a cycle of somesort or other . . .19 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt661]Now, a magician—getting back to cause and effect and Aleister’s work—a magicianpostulates what his goal will be before he starts to accomplish what he’s doing.. . . And the magician was very ritualistic and he would very carefullypostulate what effect he was trying to achieve before he would be cause for thateffect.20 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt662]Urban quotes from a work attributed to Hubbard called “Affirmations” that Urbanregards as involving some kind of channeled contact with a feminine spiritualguide in Hubbard’s life called “your Guardian,” showing kinship with Crowley’sessential idea of the Holy Guardian Angel. Of course it can be argued that sinceboth Crowley’s system and Hubbard’s developed system seem deeply rooted ingnostic tradition whence the conception of the spiritual bride beyond time andspace derives, with both systems presented in terms of scientific method, it isinevitable that one should be able to locate parallels of philosophic substance,if not of nomenclature.*203 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft203]Had Crowley been able to get to the United States of America in time, of course,history may have turned out very differently.image [images/img_002.jpg]In 1946, with Sara off with L. Ron Hubbard, Jack Parsons married militaryveteran and aspiring artist Marjorie Cameron (1922–1995), whose “Louise Brooksturned psychedelic” visage would appear alongside Anaïs Nin in Kenneth Anger’sremarkable film Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome (1954).Parsons decided to be rid of 1003 South Orange Grove Avenue. The last time Smithsaw the house was January 12, 1947, when he went to look at the old place andpick up anything Parsons may have left of significance. Sadly, he founddiscarded accoutrements he had hand fashioned for the temple of the New Aeon.Soon after, the house was demolished.“The sun went out. I heard at noon to day Crowley died.”22[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt664] So wrote Wilfred Smith in his diary on December14, a fortnight after Aleister Crowley died of bronchitis and heart failure inHastings, England. Smith was heartsick. He wished he could have done more toadvance Thelema in his life. He was not optimistic about the future, knowingKarl Germer had been named as his successor by Crowley in his will. In this hewas right. Germer was in no state of mind to think positively or strategicallyabout the O.T.O.’s future.The Beast did eventually come back to America. Crowley’s executors dispatchedCrowley’s ashes to Germer’s care. He buried them near a tree in his house in theHamptons, New Jersey. When Karl and wife, Sascha, decided to move to Californiaand be closer to the surviving band of faithful Thelemites, Germer tried to findthe ashes but could not. Many years before, Crowley had written:Bury me in a nameless grave,I came from God, the world to save,I brought them wisdom from above:Worship, and Liberty, and Love.They slew me for I did disparage therefore,Religion, law, and marriage.So be my grave without a name,That earth may swallow up my shame!It was American soil that swallowed Crowley’s “shame.”WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE BEAST IN AMERICA?First, the Antichrist. In September 1948, poor Jack was stripped of his securityclearance, and a career that would lead posthumously to his name being given toa crater on the moon, crashed. He had to take menial jobs and lost most of hisfriends. At Halloween, in search of supernatural guidance, Parsons returned tothe pursuit of “Our Lady Babalon.” In a vision, Parsons was granted a name,should he, that is, survive crossing the Abyss: BELARION ARMILUSS AL DAJJAL,ANTICHRIST. On December 28, 1948, Parsons took the Oath of a Master of theTemple, equivalent in his own mind to the “Oath of Antichrist” in the presenceof the one Parsons called “the Unknown God,” Frater 132 (Wilfred T. Smith).With Marjorie’s encouragement, Parsons clawed his way back. After a thoroughinvestigation in the midst of McCarthyite anti-communist hysteria, a federalhearing found Parsons innocent of communist subversion; Parsons declared himselfan “individualist.” He was picked up by the Hughes Corporation, which recognizedhis immense scientific, rather than occult, value. Unfortunately, an offer towork in Israel led to precipitous accusations of spying for the Israeli statewhen he borrowed his classified papers to attach them to a CV he was preparingfor the Israelis. His contact was in fact with the American-based TechnionSociety that provided support for technical innovation in Israel. Cleared ofaccusations of espionage, there was now so much dark innuendo and occultstrangeness on his record that in January 1952 he was excluded officially fromworking on classified projects. A perceived risk of Parsons being careless withdocumentation was deemed a liability.Parsons went back to making explosives and pyrotechnics for the film industry inhis own laboratory on South Orange Grove Avenue. On June 17, 1952, while packedand loaded up to move to Baja, Mexico, where Jack had a job at an explosiveplant (an interim move preparatory to moving to Israel) and with Marjorie outshopping for groceries, an accident with fulminate of mercury caused anexplosion that left Parsons mutilated and dying in the wreckage of the lab. Hedied soon after. Hearing the news, his mother, Ruth, committed suicide on thespot: a tragic end. At Parsons’s funeral gathered most of the survivors of theAgape Lodge: Smith, Helen Parsons, Jane Wolfe, Ray and Mildred Burlingame,daughter Laylah, Phyllis Seckler and her children, Paul, Lisa, and Stella,Georgia Schneider, Ed Forman, Louis Culling, and Helen’s sister Sara, who hadnow left Hubbard and become Mrs. Miles Hollister. Helen and Sara becamereconciled at the service.image [images/9781620556313_092.jpg]Fig. 36.3. After the blast at Jack Parson’s Pasadena laboratory, June 17, 1952KENNETH ANGERIn the early 1950s a fresh face appeared on America’s Thelemite canvas. Youngfilmmaker Kenneth Anger, born in Santa Monica, California, in 1927, traveled in1955 to what was left of Crowley’s villa at Cefalù, Sicily, in the company ofsexologist Alfred Kinsey (1894–1956), famous for his two reports on the sexuallife of American males and females (1948, 1953). A film was shot of Angeruncovering some of Crowley’s floor-to-ceiling artwork. A fine photographappeared of the handsome Anger holding before him the dislodged door to theAbbey of Thelema with the words DO WHAT THOU WILT still visible against thegrain. Jenny Nicholson wrote an illustrated article about the visit for PicturePost (November 16, 1955). Kinsey commented on his reaction to the paintingsrevealed by Anger in terms of his own central interest.The amazing thing is that Crowley lived a life that would not normally have beentolerated in the most primitive parts of darkest Africa. He thought he could getaway with blatant sex practices and in fact he did get away with them for manyyears.23 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt665]Kinsey did not live to see the “swinging sixties,” but the sixties certainly sawthe influence that Aleister Crowley had on artist of film Kenneth Anger. In aunique body of filmed work, Anger has defied commercial tropes and made moviesthe way Symbolist and early Surrealist artists painted pictures. The influenceof Thelema is sometimes subtle, sometimes quite direct, but the solar-phallicenergy that infuses Anger’s often homoerotic work is undeniable, working on adream level that awakens unconscious imagery and experience. Crowley wrote thatpoetry was the geyser of the soul, an idea given full visual flourish in a worklike Lucifer Rising, a version of which I had the good fortune to see at aspecial showing in King’s Cross, London, in 1982, where images of volcaniceruption crosscut with a narrative that combines the emergence of Lilith (playedby Marianne Faithful), Egyptian pyramids, Isis, and Osiris, the latter playedvery forcefully by Crowley’s friend Charles Cammell’s son, Donald, also afilmmaker of great distinction. Stèle 666 of the Priest Ankh-f-n-Khonsu so dearto Crowley as inspiring the events around the reception of The Book of the Lawhas an honored part in the film, and a photo of Crowley is garlanded, while agenuine sense of magick pervades this very beautiful film experience.Anger was of great interest to Crowley’s leading British followers when hevisited London and showed his films at the ICA cinema. And because it is wellknown that Anger’s purity of intention and visual panache has influencedAmerican filmmakers both “experimental” and commercial, such as Martin Scorsese,then we must also say that part of the legacy of the Beast in America may besought in cinema.After Parsons’s death, the remainder of the 1950s passed with intermittentrancor between Smith and Germer, as one might expect, while Gerald Yorke inEngland proceeded to assemble Crowley’s literary remains, while John Symondsused that work for his own purposes and succeeded in damning the Beast’s legacywhile at the same time bringing the Beast’s name to a far wider audience thanhitherto.Germer favored Brazilian student, the very troubled Marcelo Motta (1931–1986),and insisted Crowley had had no time for Smith, that all his involvement withthe O.T.O. was futile, but like so many arguments in the extended Thelemitefamily, nothing was ever quite absolute and forever, though when Germer andSmith finally met in person in June 1956, neither predictably had a good word tosay about the other afterward.The “Unknown God” died on April 27, 1957, and was cremated at the GrandviewMemorial Park in Glendale. Motta’s response to Smith’s death showed what atroubled individual he really was: “Good riddance, and let him make a stepforward in the next!”24 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt666]EK-STASISOur word ecstasy comes from two Greek words. Put together they mean to come froma static position, to make a shift, and by extension, to “come out of oneself.”When we see young people who are too introspective for their own good, we mightsuggest they need to “come out of themselves a bit more.” That is really thevery good aspect of the 1960s. Many people came out of themselves, they movedfrom static positions. The whole thing was about movement, movin’ and groovin’,if you like. Eldridge Cleaver famously opined that the blacks gave the whitesback their bodies. There’s some literal truth in that: all that shaking about,far from the disciplines of Western dance—I don’t just mean the jiggling aboutin discotheques that passed for dancing in the late sixties and seventies, butFred Astaire, and West Side Story, and Bob Fosse, and the idea of dance as“revival,” something linked to the spirit. Crowley had said of his Rites ofEleusis in 1910 that the rites aimed at inducing ecstasy; he was laughed at, orfeared, but he was well ahead of the game. The buttons went very high up in1910. And of course, come 1965, it was the hemlines that rose as the buttonscame undone.Crowley seems to have foreseen something of the kind, as we find in an importantletter he wrote to Major Grady McMurtry on November 2, 1944. A “legacy” of JackParsons, having been introduced to the Pasadena lodge before he joined the army,McMurtry was also a legacy of Crowley’s, intended for future service, as thisremarkable letter demonstrates. At the time it was written, Crowley wasrecuperating from the “buzz-bomb” raids on London at a Buckinghamshire Inn, andMaj. McMurtry was on perilous active service in northern France, shortly beforethe famous “Battle of the Bulge,” hence the use of the English hunting termblooding about McMurtry’s qualification to be O.T.O. Head or “Caliph” (i.e.,successor to the prophet of Thelema), after Germer.Frater Saturnus [Germer] is of course the natural Caliph; but there are manydetails concerning the actual policy or working which would hit his blind spots.In any case, he can only be a stopgap, because of his age; I have to look forhis successor. It has been hell; so many have come up with amazing promise, onlyto go on the rocks. . . . I do not think of you as lying on a grassy hillsidewith a lot of dear sweet woolly lambs, capering to your flute! On the contrary.Your actual life, or “blooding,” is the sort of initiation which I regard as thefirst essential for a Caliph. For—say 20 years hence—the Outer Head of the Ordermust, among other things, have had the experience of war as it is in actual facttoday. 1965 e.v. should be a critical period in the development of the ChildHorus!25 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt667]As indeed it was! How extraordinarily perceptive of the Beast! And World War IIand Korean War veteran Major Grady McMurtry (retd.) might have seized the reinsat the moment the psychedelic sixties began. For 1965 was the year the Beatles’proto-psychedelic Rubber Soul got under the skin of Brian Wilson; the year MaryQuant invented the miniskirt; the year John Lennon and George Harrison firsttook LSD; the year Jimmy Page was offered Eric Clapton’s job in the Yardbirds;the year of Bob Dylan’s Highway 61 Revisited, and Bringing It All Back Home; theStones’s 19th Nervous Breakdown; the year the Pink Floyd Sound began; the yearSir Winston Churchill died—need I go on? Surely not. You get the idea.Grady didn’t take the reins because a regularly paranoid Karl Germer had triedto keep him down, preventing him from founding new lodges in California. Gradygot fed up with what was left of the O.T.O.Meanwhile the Aeon of the Crowned and Conquering Child showed itself mostforcefully in the musical and artistic ecstasies of the mid- to late-1960s. PaulMcCartney visited Timothy d’Arch Smith’s occult bookshop in St. John’s Wood.John Lennon started devouring books on Magick and insisted on Crowley’s beingone of the faces of the “people we like” on the epoch-marking Sgt. Pepper’sLonely Hearts Club Band album, an energized, enthusiastic epoch that spawned allkinds of remarkable musical offspring, from Pink Floyd, to Led Zeppelin(starring overt Crowley aficionado Jimmy Page), to early “Heavy Metal,” whoseinterest in dark, foreboding feelings sprang up in Birmingham (where I was born)with Black Sabbath, featuring John Michael “Ozzy” Osbourne, writer of a famoussong, “Mr. Crowley,” which is not about his head teacher.In 1968, Phyllis Seckler, trained by Jane Wolfe in the old Pasadena Church ofThelema, wrote a letter to Grady, calling on his authority to deal with theconfusion and crisis of Crowley’s organizational legacy. The question hadbecome, Will the real O.T.O. stand up? Marcelo Ramos Motta, claiming Germer’sauthority, had his group, based in Brazil. In Switzerland, Hermann Josef Metzgerhad had his handful of members elect him O.T.O. head after Germer’s death.Kenneth Grant, who had been expelled by Germer after Germer had first given himpermission to work a Camp in England in the fifties, had his own “O.T.O.”operating in and around Swingin’ London, while versions of Crowley’s workcirculated with scant editorial control, or literary respect, generally creatingan atmosphere around Crowley’s name very far from Crowley’s true intentions.Crowley wrote many times that “Do what thou wilt” did not mean “Do as thouwilt.” He maintained there was no place for “looseness” in Thelemic life. Itwas, he said, without irony, the “most austere ethical precept ever uttered,”for one has no right but to do one’s will. The true will is the will of “God” inevery star. Noninterference in the true will of others is the cornerstone of thesystem. For the uninitiated it is an impossible ideal; for the initiated, itain’t easy either! It’s a way of life, a march to a goal: “One Star in Sight” asCrowley’s helpful initiate’s poem puts it.Somebody had to seize the reins, and that somebody couldn’t be just anybody. Inthis respect, we should observe that in the Beast’s correspondence withMcMurtry, who spent long evenings with Crowley when the former was stationednear London and Crowley lived in St. James’s (93 Jermyn Street), Crowley usedthe Latin Fidus Achates for McMurtry. It means trusted armour bearer andfaithful friend of Aeneas. That was McMurtry’s classical role.Crowley groomed and positioned McMurtry as Germer’s likely successor, giving himunique authority to be used in case of emergency. Germer provoked such anemergency by failing to name his heir before he died in 1962.Heeding Phyllis Seckler’s call (Grady and Phyllis would later marry), McMurtryactivated his powers in 1969 to revivify the O.T.O. internationally as caliphand acting O.H.O. On McMurtry’s death in 1985, he was succeeded in both officesby William Breeze, or Hymenaeus Beta (McMurtry had taken the name HymenaeusAlpha, given him by Crowley). Hymenaeus was a god of wedding feasts and song inGreek mythology; also an opponent of Saint Paul at Ephesus.One of the first things Grady attempted to do was to find out what was going onin the minds of youth as the seventies kicked in. Grady had been thetwenty-five-year-old youngster when Crowley entertained his nonstop talk in hisrooms in Jermyn Street, London, 1944. He was now more than fifty and had spent alot of time delving deeply into Sufi mysticism, or gnosis. There were youngpeople at the time inspired by Sufi texts, for as many “hippies” traveled toMorocco as they did to Kathmandu. Crosby, Stills, and Nash wrote a song,“Marrakesh Express,” about the North African hippy trail. What Grady did notknow about, with all his worldwide learning, was what all the fuss was aboutthis drug L.S.D. (lysergic acid diethylamide), first synthesized chemically byAlbert Hoffman of the Sandoz Pharmaceutical Corporation in the 1940s and derivedfrom ergot fungus. Grady’s initiation into the 1960s began, in fact, withCrowley toward the end of World War II, but its culmination was spectacular andis best told as William Breeze told it to me in a Manhattan restaurant in 2012.On one of his visits to Crowley—probably a later one as Crowley had apparentlyby then formulated his plan that Grady act as Caliph to his Prophet after hisdeath—the 1960s came up.Crowley told Grady that he would know his work was to begin when he saw youngpeople living in tents and dressing in oriental garb.When Grady moved back to the Bay Area to investigate the robbery of the O.T.O.Archive from Sascha Germer, he was an instructor at Georgetown Universityworking at the U.S. Department of Labor. Clean cut, black horn-rims, militarybearing and speech patterns, crease in the trousers, and shined shoes. When hearrived in the Haight he was an alien—and they had wall hangings and dressed inloose oriental clothing, which took him back to what Crowley had said.He had not tried L.S.D. but had heard about it and asked his host, Chuck (one ofthe Level Press people, with Llee Heflin) if he could take some. He was given atab, which he took, and sat and waited. Time passed, and he got impatient whennothing happened, so he asked for more, remarking that he was a large man. Sothey gave him another tab. And left the bag on the table. After more timepassed, with nothing happening, he got impatient again and without askinganyone, shook out the content of the bag and swallowed the lot. Grady said thebag had many more L.S.D. tabs plus at least one hit of S.T.P. [streetname forsynthetic hallucinogen 2, 5-Dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine] that he didn’t knowabout. He took all of them. He later recalled eleven tabs total according to oneperson who heard the story from him [Bill Heidrick].One of his hosts came in and noticed that he was on the floor writhing around.No doubt the empty baggie was noticed as well. It seems that Grady was tryingwithout much success to take off his clothes. Whether they helped him change ornot, I’m not sure, but it was suggested that they take him down to the Pacific(reportedly the area where Playland used to be) for a walk, “set and setting”and all that, where he could cool out.The Pacific is deceptively named—pacific at times but given to sudden freakwaves of some size. Grady was walking along the beach, with his friend taggingalong nearby, when a huge wave came in and covered him, and the undertowdragging him out to sea. His friend looked for him, walking down the beach,calling his name, with no results, and after some time had passed another bigwave came in and deposited Grady on the beach, blue from cold and not breathing.An ambulance was called and he was taken to hospital. He was admitted dead onarrival, taken to the basement morgue and put on an exam slab with his toe tagfilled out.An unknown amount of time later, he woke up alone in the morgue on theslab—peaking on who knows how many micrograms of acid. If there had been tentabs and they were Orange Sunshine or similar, then maybe 3500 micrograms—aboutthree times the typical max dose of a very experienced L.S.D. user, thethreshold being about 80 micrograms and the typical dose being about 350. Plushe apparently took S.T.P., a rare psychedelic, and one in which the trip lastsfor several days.But however the experience ended in the hospital—probably he was given thorazineand so on—he suffered terrible after-effects from this, including memory loss,profound personality change, and a complete overnight change in appearance—thehair and beard of course grew to give the Grady we know. He struggled withdepression and made at least one suicide attempt in the months following this.His marriage [to Phyllis]—not good to start with—disintegrated. But the Gradywho had arrived from Washington, D.C., would have gotten precisely nowhere inrebuilding the O.T.O. It is only because Grady underwent his transformation thathe succeeded in reaching and relating to the young people in the newcounterculture, the people who made the O.T.O. renaissance a reality. Grady hadhad a very powerful ego structure and a strong personality to match—even Crowleywould be left exhausted by his company after a few hours, and the few recordedaccounts of his early meetings with some of the young people out there were notencouraging—to them he was an old guy with old books but sort of without a clueas to what was going on. That changed, and he became a countercultural icon inhis way.Aside from the obvious Egyptian Book of the Dead theme of all this, it changedGrady fundamentally. Where before his letters to Yorke were written in clipped,military staccato, businesslike in his way, they changed to rambling missivesloaded with countercultural slang and mystical references. Yorke became alarmedand suggested politely that Grady should take it easy with the drugexperimentation.Crowley’s rather vague prophecy carried quite a sting. But he rose to theoccasion, as you British probably still say!Fortunately, Grady McMurtry’s experiment did not lead him—as it has a number ofabusers of the ambiguous drug—into “looseness,” as Crowley called undisciplined,un-Thelemic behavior. Many did, and do, get themselves in a frightful mess by“looseness.” The brain is already a pharmacopoeia of psychedelic compounds.Poisoning it is not the same as freeing the Spirit. Sermon over.Well, my sermon anyway. The Beast has one more for us.When we talk about the Legacy of the Beast in America, we shall do well, Ithink, to heed some of his own prognostications, heralded here with a paraphraseof a line from John Lennon’s song “Mind Games” (1973):image [images/9781620556313_093.jpg]Fig. 36.4. Grady Louis McMurtry (1918–1985)Faith in the future out of the nowThe year 1936 was an interesting one for the Beast. While Agape Lodge totteredon the edge of a three-year period of relative dormancy, George SylvesterViereck had lunch with Crowley in London. They hadn’t seen each other since theend of the war that did not end all wars. At lunch, Viereck agreed to sign anaffidavit maintaining that Crowley had not been in trouble with American justiceauthorities during the war. Doubtless Crowley’s request was in connection withacquiring a visa to return to the States. Viereck also volunteered to Crowleythat after the war he had made friends with British Naval Intelligence chiefs,and they told Viereck that Crowley had been working for them during the war.Crowley does not record whether Viereck was surprised to learn this.26[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt668]In mid-September of the same year, foreseeing inevitable conflict with Hitler,Crowley worked on a document called “Proofs of the Scientific Solution of theProblems of Government.” This he wrote under the pseudonym the Comte deFénix.*204 [9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft204] He wanted followers to know whatmight yet be expected of the Aeon of Horus, for The Book of the Law’s notoriousthird chapter seemed to delineate a complete and terrible break-down ofcivilized values and religious conventions. He puts forward what is perhaps hisessential legacy: a vision of the present and of the future, even though thepath to that future will involve many hard pills to swallow.The third chapter of the Book is difficult to understand, and may be veryrepugnant to many people born before the date of the book (April, 1904). Ittells us the characteristics of the Period on which we are now entered.Superficially, they appear appalling. We see some of them already withterrifying clarity. But fear not!It explains that certain vast “stars” (or aggregates of experience) may bedescribed as Gods. One of these is in charge of the destinies of this planet forperiods of 2,000 years. In the history of the world, as far as we knowaccurately, are three such Gods: Isis, the mother, when the universe wasconceived as simple nourishment drawn directly from her; this period is markedby matriarchal government.Next, beginning 500 BC, Osiris, the father, when the universe was imagined ascatastrophic, love, death, resurrection, as the method by which experience wasbuilt up; this corresponds to patriarchal systems.Now, Horus, the child, in which we come to perceive events as a continual growthpartaking in its elements of both these methods, and not to be overcome bycircumstance. This present period involves the recognition of the individual asthe unit of society.We realize ourselves as explained in the first paragraphs of this essay. Everyevent, including death, is only one more accretion to our experience, freelywilled by ourselves from the beginning and therefore also predestined.This “God,” Horus, has a technical title: Heru-Ra-Ha, a combination of twingods, Ra-Hoor-Khuit and Hoor-Paar-Kraat. The meaning of this doctrine must bestudied in Magick [Crowley’s book]. (He is symbolized as a Hawk-Headed Godenthroned.)He rules the present period of 2,000 years, beginning in 1904. Everywhere hisgovernment is taking root. Observe for yourselves the decay of the sense of sin,the growth of innocence and irresponsibility, the strange modifications of thereproductive instinct with a tendency to become bi-sexual or epicene, thechildlike confidence in progress combined with nightmare fear of catastrophe,against which we are yet half unwilling to take precautions.Consider the outcrop of dictatorships, only possible when moral growth is in itsearliest stages, and the prevalence of infantile cults like Communism, Fascism,Pacifism, Health Crazes, Occultism in nearly all its forms, religionssentimentalized to the point of practical extinction.Consider the popularity of the cinema, the wireless, the football pools andguessing competitions, all devices for soothing fractious infants, no seed ofpurpose in them.Consider sport, the babyish enthusiasms and rages which it excites, wholenations disturbed by disputes between boys.Consider war, the atrocities which occur daily and leave us unmoved and hardlyworried.We are children.THE NEXT STEPDemocracy dodders. Ferocious Fascism, cackling Communism, equally frauds, cavortcrazily all over the globe. They are hemming us in. They are the abortive birthsof the Child.Above us today hangs a danger never yet paralleled in history. We suppress theindividual in more and more ways. We think in terms of the herd. War no longerkills soldiers; it kills all indiscriminately. Every new measure of the mostdemocratic and autocratic governments is Communistic in essence. It is alwaysrestriction. We are all treated as imbecile children. Dora,*205[9781620556313_ftn.xhtml#ft205] the Shops Act, the Motoring Laws, Sundaysuffocation, the Censorship—they won’t trust us to cross the roads at will.Fascism is like Communism, and dishonest into the bargain. The dictatorssuppress all art, literature, theater, music, news, that does not meet theirrequirements; yet the world only moves by the light of genius. The herd will bedestroyed in mass.The establishment of the Law of Thelema is the only way to pre serve individualliberty and to assure the future of the race.In the words of the famous paradox of Comte de Fénix—the absolute rule of thestate shall be a function of the absolute liberty of each individual will.That latter point posits a spiritual revolution in the essence of governmentthat we have yet to see turned into a practical political program. Crowley’sessential interest and legacy is his vital assertion of human liberty. Hebelieved in Man. Most of us only think we do; “Man” is not the same as thepolitical phrase “the People,” which in practice means a num-ber of votes for“the people” who rule. Man is a spiritual concept.Perhaps it turns out that the religions have been wrong to fear the Beast.Rather perhaps, they should embrace him, and in finding their other half, mayfind themselves. For, from that point of view vouchsafed to those above theabyss of confused, baseless egoism and earthbound thinking, the serpent is themessiah; the Scarlet Woman is the woman clothed with the sun; and the Beast isthe lamb, led to Hermetic transformation.We do have somewhere to go, and it is better. If, that is, we choose, like theComte de Fénix, to rise from the flames in love.The fire of love no waters shall devour;The faith of friendship stands the shocks of time;Seal with our voice the triumph of this hour,Your glory to our glory and our power,Alliance of one tongue, one faith, one clime!Seal and clasp hands; and let the sea proclaimFriendship of righteous fame,And lordship of two worlds that time can never tame.27[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt669]image [images/9781620556313_003.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX ONEimage [images/9781620556313_099.jpg](Simeon) Leon Engers (Kennedy) (1891–1970)by Frank van Lamoen, Assistant Curator, Stedelijk Museum, AmsterdamThe following are the notes created by Frank van Lamoen documenting his researchinto the life of Leon Engers.1843Dec. 7, 1843: Levie Salomon Engers, a Jewish baker (Winschoten 1822– Groningen1903), marries Betje Izak Schwab (Groningen 1816–1876).

Thispurchase formed the basis of the Crowley books contained in the John Quinncollection.The Aleister Crowley books in the collection were sold the afternoon of November14, 1923, through Anderson Galleries, New York.The following is from the complete catalogue of the library of John Quinn, soldby auction in five parts. Published New York, Anderson Galleries, 1923–1924.A NOTE BY JOHN QUINNI have been asked to state what determined me to sell my library and also towrite about the books and manuscripts. I am willing to comply with the firstrequest, but as to the second the books and manuscripts must speak forthemselves. I had no intention of selling my library until I was suddenly metwith the necessity of moving from my large old-fashioned apartment with largerooms and plenty of wall space. The choice was forced upon me either of taking avery large house, which I did not care to do, or of storing my books. Then Icame to feel that once they had been stored they would remain storedindefinitely, perhaps for years. That led me to the determination to sell them.The agreement was “all or nothing,” an agreement which has been faithfullyadhered to, though parting with certain personal items gave me many a pang.The books and manuscripts must speak for themselves. Voltaire said ofVauvenargues that he had “preferences, but no exclusions.” I might say thatwhile I have had many preferences, I have also had exclusions. But the hatredsand the bores were long ago cast out, or rather never secured a place on myshelves. The catalogue is a reflection of a widely interested intellectual life.Many of the books are records of friendships that have enriched my life. Thelist is too long even to refer to them here. It is a record in part of theadmirations, the enthusiasms, and affections of a lifetime.Most of the books were secured by me as they were issued or published and thataccounts for their good condition. If I attempted to tell all that the books andmanuscripts have meant to me, it would require a small volume. Gems of art,moving one still by their old music, age has not withered them nor can customstale their infinite variety. I think it was Byron who said that when a farewellis to be final it should be brief. I cannot go through or attempt to write aboutor to tell what these books and manuscripts, which contain a world of beauty andromance or enshrine the records of friendships and of interests and enthusiasms,have meant to me, for they seem to me to be a part of myself, even though I maysmile a little at my own feeling.J.Q.ALEISTER CROWLEY [CATALOGUE SUMMARY; AUTHOR UNKNOWN, POSSIBLY QUINN, POSSIBLYJEANNE ROBERT FOSTER.]One of the strangest abnormalities among the modern religious revivalists ofmysticism and mystical teaching. Born of a highly respectable family, the fatherof which was a member of the Plymouth Brethren, he was educated at Cambridge andattained distinction there as a classical scholar. After he left the University,he engaged in literature, and privately printed a number of volumes of poetry ofan unusually high quality of insight and expression. He had given himself up tothe study of the arcana of knowledge and had steeped himself in the lore ofmagic and astrology, in the Kruptadia of the Eleusinian and Orphic mysteries,and in the secret expositions of Buddhistic rites and ceremonies. He posed as an“adept,” and conducted a church in London, in which he held the services andtaught the doctrines of a religion he had elaborated out of his studies. Hecontemplated the building of a magnificent temple to be dedicated to thisreligion, and he would, probably, have succeeded in carrying out his plans, hadnot his conduct as High Priest of his church brought him into conflict with theauthorities, so that his church was closed. He then turned again to literature,and privately printed a magazine, the Equinox, which he issued to subscribers ata high price, of a curiously interesting nature, and now very rare. The warbrought him to America, where he attempted to revive interest in his church andto further the building of his temple. He gave lectures and held services andsought in various ways to obtain followers and arouse enthusiasm. He claimed tohave obtained his secret knowledge from the Grand Llama of Tibet, during apersonal interview. As a writer he is in a class by himself, for his subjectmatters deal mainly with the mysteries and symbolisms of the early expressionsof religions, and more particularly with those expressions which took the formsof Phallicism and Orphicism. Curious stories are told about the retreat which heestablished in Italy for himself and his special devotees.[The following is the list of Quinn’s Crowley collection provided for theauction of November 14, 1923.]2155 Aceldama: A Place to Bury Strangers In; A Philosophical Poem.

Baker and Jones remained friends even thoughBaker, unlike Jones, sided with Crowley’s opponents in the latter’s conflictwith London members of the GD in 1900.*9 [9781620556313_c01.xhtml#fr9] Herbert Jerome Pollitt (1871–1942), Cambridgefootlights entertainer, friend of Aubrey Beardsley, aesthete, and artcollector—and Crowley’s former lover for six months in early 1898.*10 [9781620556313_c01.xhtml#fr10] According to William Breeze (Notes; The Drugand Other Stories, 641–42), Lieutenant Vincent English, R.N. (retd.), was takenon as the Firefly’s temporary captain as a precaution, the regular captain beingMilnes Patmore (1848–1906), son of poet and British Museum librarian CoventryPatmore (1823–1896). Capt. Patmore’s wife was author and historian KatharineAlexandra (née Stewart) Patmore (1865–1942). She was Allan Bennett’s firstcousin, and Breeze thinks it likely that Crowley was introduced to the Carlistsby Bennett. Furthermore, Breeze reckons that Crowley made a “codedacknowledgement” of that connection by using the name “V. English” as signatureto a short story, dedicated to his mother, The Testament of Magdalen Blair (TheEquinox I (9), March 1913), which was signed “V. English, M.D.” The manuscript,originally titled “The King of Terrors” (dated November 11, 1912), Crowley gaveto American collector John Quinn (whom we shall meet in chapter 8) with theinscription “To John Quinn the MS. of my best story (so far). Christmas 1914, atiny tribute from Aleister Crowley” (see Quinn’s collection of Crowleyana inappendix 2).*11 [9781620556313_c01.xhtml#fr11] Glenstrae being the ancestral lands of theonce condemned MacGregor clan.†12 [9781620556313_c01.xhtml#fr12] Meaning “between us.”‡13 [9781620556313_c01.xhtml#fr13] That is, “hidden” or “lost,” as editor IvorBack put it in a footnote to The [Collected] Works of Aleister Crowley.*14 [9781620556313_c01.xhtml#fr14] Crowley added on the opposite page of thediary MS: “Met Evelyn H[all] accidentally by U.C.L. [University College London].She reaffirms her statements: but her description of the ‘college chum’ isabsurd and her whole attitude ridiculous. She knows one fact only—the nameCrowley at Cambridge.” The lady was Evelyn Beatrice Hall (1868–1956), a mistressof Crowley from 1900–1901 and daughter of the rector of St. Clement’s,Eastcheap. A writer of fiction, she also published, according to WilliamBreeze’s Notes for The Drug and Other Stories (p. 631), studies of Voltaire,Mirabeau and the women of the French salons. Crowley described her as “thewedand sinewed” in his poem “The Symbolists,” (Konx Om Pax, 1910) evident inAlfred-Pierre Agache’s 1896 portrait of her, The Sword (L’Épée; Ontario ArtGallery). “The Symbolists” is concerned with theology and refers to Evelyn’s“father’s fancy hats.”*15 [9781620556313_c01.xhtml#fr15] Maria Theresa Henrietta Dorothea deAustria-Este-Modena was the daughter of the duke of Modena and wife of Ludwig,Regent—later King—Ludwig III of Bavaria.*16 [9781620556313_c01.xhtml#fr16] The reference is to John 1:30: “This is he ofwhom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he wasbefore me.” The implication is of the Baptist and of spiritual baptism, that isthe “water” of initiation. Also a pun: Crowley is coming “after” Kelly, and AChas been through the grade exam before.†17 [9781620556313_c01.xhtml#fr17] Crowley’s friend and sometime guide, FraterVolo Noscere = George Cecil Jones (1873–1960).*18 [9781620556313_c01.xhtml#fr18] Another ex-pupil of the Slade School of Art,Moina, or “Mina,” Mathers, née Bergson (1865–1928), sister of philosopher HenriBergson.†19 [9781620556313_c01.xhtml#fr19] Lucile Hill (?1867–1922) of Trenton, NewJersey, was understudy to soprano Susan Strong in the role of Venus inTannhaüser, which opened on May 15, 1900, to run for seven performances throughMay, June, and July at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London. Lucilewould play the role of Elizabeth in the same opera in the autumn. Tannhaüserinspired Crowley’s verse play of the same name, written in Mexico later in 1900.During the 1890s, soprano Lucile Hill had shared Alfred Kayne’s mansion at 358West End Avenue and 77th Street, New York, with close friend contralto AttalieClaire Smith (stage name “Attalie Claire”), who married fashionable brokerAlfred Kayne on September 15, 1892. Covering the wedding, the New York Timesdescribed Lucile Hill as “the prima donna of the Metropolitan Opera HouseCompany,” recently returned from a Covent Garden engagement. Attalie and Lucilesang at lavish, lively parties at the mansion. In 1895, The Peterson Magazinepraised Lucile as “one of the singers immensely popular within the theater andwithout, as she has a sunshiny, open-hearted and un-affected temperament thatcheers and refreshes.” Readers were also informed that this “plump little personwith a winsome, intelligent face, very youthful and with pretty, regularfeatures” could be seen “daily cantering round the corner at Seventy-seventhStreet and West End Avenue, on her way for a ride in the park, as she is anexcellent horsewoman.” Attalie Claire’s marriage to Kayne went awry. By January1899, the contralto was living with her and Kayne’s child in apartments at 74Madison Avenue, the scene of a scandalous confrontation with her husband duringdivorce proceedings. Lucile Hill sang at London’s Albert Hall at the “Last Nightof the Proms,” conducted by Sir Henry Wood on October 21, 1899, having sung onat least three other occasions during the Proms season. (See here[9781620556313_c03.xhtml#p54] for Crowley’s view of Lucile Hill).*20 [9781620556313_c01.xhtml#fr20] Mrs. Harriette Dorothea Hunter (1868–1958),Soror Deo Date (D.D.), an associate of W. B. Yeats; and her husband EdmundArthur Hunter (1866–1937), Frater Hora Et Semper (H.E.S.).†21 [9781620556313_c01.xhtml#fr21] Marcus Worsley Blackden (1864–1934), FraterMa Wahanu Thesi (M.W.T.): the Golden Dawn’s authority on Egyptian papyri and anotable GD rebel; and his sister Ada Mary Blackden (1872–1965).‡22 [9781620556313_c01.xhtml#fr22] Charles Henry Rosher (1858–1936),engineer-architect and writer, Frater Aequo Animo (A.A.), and Caroline LilyRosher (b. 1856), the “Mrs Rosher” of Helwan Road, Wealdstone, who (according toCrowley) made members’ robes and nemysses for seventy-five shillings, givenone’s tailor’s measurements.25 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt25] Charles HenryRosher, relativeand correspondent of Freidrich Engels, had providedaccommodation for Allan Bennett immediately before Bennett moved in to Crowley’sflat at Chancery Lane in 1899. Rosher’s son, Oscar-winning and many timesOscar-nominated cinematographer Charles Gladdish Rosher (1885–1974), shot twofilms featuring Hollywood character actress Jane Wolfe(1875–1958). Wolfe wouldbecome Crowley’s devoted follower after 1920 (correspondence began in 1918), bywhich time Jane had appeared in more than 100 films starting in 1910. Perhapsshe felt encouraged to contact Crowley through cameraman Rosher, whose two filmsfeaturing Jane were the five-reeler The Plow Girl (directed by Robert Z.Leonardin 1916) and The Blacklist (directed by Cecil B. de Mille).Interestingly, both Charles Roshers had offered services to the Moroccan courtof Abdul Aziz: the elder as court painter, the nephew as demonstrator of movieequipment. The Rosher-Engels connection perhaps played a part in Crowley’svisiting the Rosher house in south London in 1899.§23 [9781620556313_c01.xhtml#fr23] Edward William Berridge (1844–1920), FraterResurgam, doctor, homeopath, writer, expounder of the principles of Thomas LakeHarris.¶24 [9781620556313_c01.xhtml#fr24] Alice Isabel Simpson (b. 1853), SororPerseverantia et cura quies (P.E.C.Q.).\\\\25 [9781620556313_c01.xhtml#fr25] Miss Elaine Simpson, Soror Donorum DeiDispensatio Fidelis (D.D.D.F.).*26 [9781620556313_c01.xhtml#fr26] Procès des Templiers (“Trial of theTemplars”), by Jules Michelet; 2 vols., 1841.*27 [9781620556313_c01.xhtml#fr27] Karl von Eckartshausen’s The Cloud upon theSanctuary, first published 1804. The “Sanctuary” was identified with the“Fraternity of the Rosy Cross” in sundry occult lore.*28 [9781620556313_c02.xhtml#fr28] “[I]f R[ose] and I get as far as Cairo thiswinter, my name will go down with Bruce and Harris.

My reward is your success.I have just done—yesterday—my great ‘Dialogue between an Indian Mystic and aBritish Sceptic.’ [Collected Works, vol. 2, essay titled “Time”] A mostwearisome job! i.e.: to write. Nobody can ever read it.”1[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt37] The references to Bruce and Harris are toScottish aristocrat and explorer James Bruce (1730–1794), who circa 1769discovered the papyri of the “Bruce Codex” of Gnostic manuscripts in Egypt, andAnthony Charles Harris (1790–1869), discoverer of the “Harris Papyrus,” BritishLibrary, the longest papyrus manuscript from ancient Egypt, concerning the reignof Rameses III. It is surely interesting in view of the reception of The Book ofthe Law (April 1904) that Crowley had in his mind a year earlier the productionof a historic papyrus linked to ancient Egypt, even if as in a jest as,apparently, here.*29 [9781620556313_c02.xhtml#fr29] Quaker George Cadbury bought the reformistDaily News in 1901. Pacifist Cadbury opposed the Boer War. Carmen Saeculare isalso markedly hostile to Britain’s campaign against the Boers in South Africa,regarding the war’s conduct as an abuse of imperial power, disproportionategiven Britain’s overwhelming forces. The poem paints this as the venom of theunjust oppressor.*30 [9781620556313_c02.xhtml#fr30] The Book of the Law is also referred to asLiber AL vel Legis and abbreviated in citations as AL.*31 [9781620556313_c03.xhtml#fr31] Led by Victor-Émile Michelet; see my bookOccult Paris.†32 [9781620556313_c03.xhtml#fr32] Presumably the Golden Dawn, which,incidentally, recognized the Martinist Order.*33 [9781620556313_c03.xhtml#fr33] See here [9781620556313_c01.xhtml#p24].†34 [9781620556313_c03.xhtml#fr34] There were fewer than eight hundredautomobiles on the roads in Great Britain in 1900. Crowley went up to TrinityCollege, Cambridge with Charles Rolls (1877–1910), cofounder of Rolls-Royce. Itis believed Rolls’s Peugeot Phaeton, purchased in Paris in 1896, was the firstmotorcar in Cambridge. This probably inspired Crowley’s own investment in thefuture; Rolls was an aristocrat, third son of 1st Baron Llangattock and LadyLlangattock, and Crowley would not like to have been outdone.*35 [9781620556313_c03.xhtml#fr35] I am grateful to William Breeze for kindlysending me a photograph of Crowley’s annotations to Kelly’s copy of The Sword ofSong (p. 37, lines 105–15). Mr Breeze’s perspicacity has been decisive infinally resolving a longstanding error concerning Susan Strong, who, as far aswe know, had no relations with Crowley.*36 [9781620556313_c03.xhtml#fr36] She may not have been a member while inParis, though William Breeze has observed that she may have been initiated as aneophyte in Paris, and subsequently “Zelator” (1° = 10▫) in London, in Crowleyand Kelly’s presence.†37 [9781620556313_c03.xhtml#fr37] According to William Breeze, Lucile Hill hada husband in South Africa, which would account for her being referred to byCrowley as “Madame” in a letter to Kelly about her (see here[9781620556313_c01.xhtml#p24]), but as “Miss” in his Sword of Song annotationreferring to her stage identity.*38 [9781620556313_c03.xhtml#fr38] The proofs would probably have been those forThe Mother’s Tragedy, which was so long that Kegan Paul suggested dividing itinto two; the second part being The Soul of Osiris, published in 1901 andgenerously reviewed.†39 [9781620556313_c03.xhtml#fr39] Doubtless referring to Legitimist politics.But see chapter 4, The Two Republics [9781620556313_c04.xhtml#c04s01.01] wherewe see a fascinating reassertion of Crowley’s role in “politics.”‡40 [9781620556313_c03.xhtml#fr40] The Latin poet Ovid was exiled by EmperorAugustus to Tomis (now Constanta, Romania), where Latin was hardly spoken (hence“barbarian”) in 8 CE for obscure reasons connected with a “Carmen” (note!—in thecontext of Carmen Saeculare), a hymn or poem, “et error” (some personalindiscretion), possibly the famous Ars Amatoria, on the subject of love. Crowleyclearly felt his views and conduct made him unacceptable in his native land andsaw himself at the time as being in exile, thus comparable to Ovid, and writinghis own “Carmen” to justify that exile. It is then possible to argue thatCrowley was in America for what he at least was prepared to see as politicalreasons. This view may become more apparent and intelligible in the nextchapter.§41 [9781620556313_c03.xhtml#fr41] Probable reading of scrawled word; a colorfulmixed metaphor. An “octoroon” used to be understood as a person one-eighth blackby descent.¶42 [9781620556313_c03.xhtml#fr42] Crowley had great faith in Kelly as an artistbefore Kelly achieved success. See chapter 2, note 1.*43 [9781620556313_c04.xhtml#fr43] Sagittarius.*44 [9781620556313_c04.xhtml#fr44] The issue of oil in the Royal Navy was stillbeing debated in 1913 by the Royal Commission on Fuel and Engines when Admiralof the Fleet 1st Lord Fisher wrote in August of that year to Winston SpencerChurchill concerning the evidence given by Lord Cowdray (formerly known asWeetman Pearson) to the latter commission on supplying the navy with oil.Pearson had an interest in Mexican oil in 1901. Officially speaking, the Navydid not; the date is too early.*45 [9781620556313_c04.xhtml#fr45] “Will Climb Popo. Adventurous Party to Starton the Difficult Trip.” (Mexican Herald, December 27, 1900.) “A man from Texaswas also among the applicants for a berth in the excursion, but not untilevening did Mr. Bowdle strike a [unreadable], when everybody’s friend, theChevalier O’Rourke, of Europe, presented himself for admission.”*46 [9781620556313_c04.xhtml#fr46] Referring to the Mexican Central Railwayconnecting Mexico City with El Paso, Texas.†47 [9781620556313_c04.xhtml#fr47] “Orouke” is a clerk’s error for “O’Rourke.”Aleister Crowley arrived under this extraordinary name in Mexico from theoutset, choosing to announce “his” arrival from Paris to someone or personsunknown.*48 [9781620556313_c04.xhtml#fr48] According to William Breeze’s notes for TheDrug and Other Stories (p. 627), this was one of many aliases of psychiccon-artist Anne O’delia Salomon (1849–?), known as Mme. Laura Horos and SororS.V.A. in G.D. circles and variously as Mrs. Joseph H. Diss Debar née EdithaLoleta Landsfeldt Montez, Anna O’Delia Salomon Messant, Swami Vive Ananda, andMarie Louise de la Commune. Her last husband and accomplice was Frank DuttonJackson (1866–1948), known to the G.D. as Theodore Horos or Frater M.S.R. In1901 a sex scandal saw them imprisoned until 1906, the ructions of which broughtbad publicity onto the G.D., described in John Mulholland’s Beware FamiliarSpirits (New York, London, Scribner’s, 1938).*49 [9781620556313_c04.xhtml#fr49] Crowley offered a very brief account of hiswartime motives and activities in an article, “THEY CALLED ME A RENEGADE,”published in British newspaper the Empire News, Sunday, December 17, 1933.Crowley made the point that he had never been arrested in his life and had evenvisited Scotland Yard after the war to ask the police if they had anythingagainst him (at which they “simply laughed at the idea”) and had lived inBritain subsequently “without hurt or hindrance.” An edited version of “The LastStraw” appeared in Symonds and Grant’s abridged version of Confessions in 1969.*50 [9781620556313_c05.xhtml#fr50] Hovey undertook a series of climbspractically identical to those followed by Crowley and Eckenstein in 1900; hisphotographs give one a sense of what was really involved. One suspects thatsomebody in the American colony had taken notice of Crowley’s adventurousitinerary and caught on to its tourist potential.*51 [9781620556313_c06.xhtml#fr51] Having left the GD in April 1900, AliceIsabel Simpson found an eligible husband for daughter Elaine3[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt90] (Soror Fidelis) in German Paul Harry Witkowski,working in Hong Kong for Arnhold, Karberg & Co., an agent in the Far East forseveral European and American shipping and insurance companies, with a largeproperty portfolio and branches in China, London, and New York. In Hong Kong thebusiness enjoyed a seat on the board of directors of the Hong Kong and ShanghaiBanking Corporation. Witkowski occupied that seat from 1899 to 1901 while a moresenior colleague vacationed in Europe. Elaine married Witkowski on June 12,1900, at Saint Saviour’s Paddington, then left for Hong Kong where she gavebirth to her first child at the end of June 1901.*52 [9781620556313_c06.xhtml#fr52] Crowley was always curiously close to thepulse of history, even with the ships he sailed on. Laid down at C. S. Swan &Hunter’s yard at Newcastle on Tyne, England, and launched on September 24, 1898,the 6,070-ton America Maru passenger cargo ship was placed four months laterwith its crew of 128 on the Oriental Steamship Company’s Trans-Pacific routebetween Hong Kong, Shanghai, Nagasaki, Kobe, Yokohama, Honolulu, and SanFrancisco. Not only was the America Maru critical to the Honolulu plague events,but from June to August 1900 she had served in the Boxer Rebellion in China, andwhen after the September 1901 peace treaty between the Chinese empress and thecolonial powers was signed, and the revolution against the Qing Dynasty led bySun Yat-sen, first president of Nationalist China, failed, Sun would go intoexile to Yokohama aboard the America Maru. Requisitioned on February 4, 1904, bythe Imperial Japanese Navy, she was attached to the Combined Fleet’s YokosukaNaval District and helped to defeat the Russian fleet in 1905.*53 [9781620556313_c06.xhtml#fr53] I should include William Breeze’s observationthat the possibility exists that the review may have been the work of Crowleyhimself, masochistically garnering attention by self-parody and an invitationfor curiosity to investigate a work purportedly wicked.*54 [9781620556313_c08.xhtml#fr54] A most interesting application from Crowley’sesoteric grade as a “Master of the Temple,” Magister Templi 8° = 3▫, thatinsisted the adept adopt this attitude as an imperative injunction.*55 [9781620556313_c08.xhtml#fr55] Elbert Hubbard, writer, artist, publisher,philosopher, socialist, and anarchist, and his wife, Alice Moore Hubbard, diedon May 7, 1915, when a German submarine torpedoed RMS Lusitania.*56 [9781620556313_c08.xhtml#fr56] Michael Brenner (1889–1969).*57 [9781620556313_c08.xhtml#fr57] Journalist’s errors: Crowley was in the FarEast in July 1901. Crowley was not a permanent resident of Paris in 1914; themagic rites with Neuburg took place in a hotel suite.*58 [9781620556313_c08.xhtml#fr58] See appendix 2 for the very extensivecollection Quinn had acquired of Crowley’s books and manuscripts.*59 [9781620556313_c09.xhtml#fr59] Possibly Fanny Bullock Workmen, who achievedthe women’s altitude record in 1912, but more likely mountaineer and diplomatGuy Bullock (1887–1956), elected to the Alpine Club in 1919, and who in 1913 wasposted to the British consulate in New Orleans to deal with refugees from theMexican Revolution. Guy Bullock would participate in the 1921 assault onEverest.*60 [9781620556313_c10.xhtml#fr60] See pages 375–76.*61 [9781620556313_c10.xhtml#fr61] Crowley sent the following letter to LeonEngers Kennedy:First—how grateful I am for your sympathy and help!Next—I am having pictures and drawings sent up at once from Cefalù. But you knowhow long that often takes. . . .Third . . . The Paris ‘Telegram’ (only evening paper in English here) is forsale 800,000 fr[ancs].Frank Harris (oldest and cleverest journalist alive) wants it. Cohen, the owner,promised to let him take it on and pay off in installments. But before thiscould be put through, people got at Cohen and put him against F.H. as apro-German: Cohen then demanded 100,000 fr. Down. And the rest as before. . . .Harris thinks Cohen would compromise on about £1200 cash down, and wants £800more to get it going. This looks to me like the very thing for yourbrother-in-law, it should suit him down to the ground to control an organ inEnglish in Paris, with an old hand like FH (with his sympathetic views too!) incharge.I should want to come in as Assistant Editor. . . . I really believe this schemewould appeal to your Bank: you need nothing so badly as an English voice here.F.H. and I could frighten the life out of the opposition which is sure to bevery bitter.Now then get a move on, Sir Lionel!Remember me to [picture of a duck or other bird: Kitty née Reilly, Engers’swife]6 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt138]*62 [9781620556313_c10.xhtml#fr62] I am grateful to William Breeze for passingon to me his discoveries about Feilding’s uncle’s and Marston’s intelligenceroles. Everard Feilding’s own intelligence role during the war, a matter ofrecord, is well established.*63 [9781620556313_c10.xhtml#fr63] The Royal Earlswood Hospital, Redhill,Surrey, was the first specialized environment for people with learningdisabilities (called “idiots” at the time), formerly sent to workhouses ormental asylums. Crowley lived in Redhill as a boy.*64 [9781620556313_c10.xhtml#fr64] Captain (later Major-General) J. F.

F. C. Fuller that year he had becomeengaged; see Chapter 8 [9781620556313_c08.xhtml].*67 [9781620556313_c10.xhtml#fr67] 33 Avenue Studios, 76, Fulham Road (SydneyClose), South Kensington SW3.*68 [9781620556313_c11.xhtml#fr68] William Breeze has furnished the author withmeticulously sourced information concerning this polymath, barrister, physician,professor, encyclopedia and journal editor, Masonic leader, bishop—and verypossibly, spy. Born July 27, 1879, in Falmouth, Cornwall, Maitland AmbroseTrevelyan Raynes’s father was civil engineer Thomas Raynes of Moseley,Birmingham, his English mother, Charlotte Trevelyan (née Simmonds) Raynes.Educated at Lancing College, Felsted School, and South African College, CapeTown, Raynes also studied at St. Augustine’s College, Ramsgate, a Roman Catholicmissionary college, and did graduate study at Keble College, Oxford, from 1899to 1901. Called to the bar at the Middle Temple on April 3, 1902, he firstvisited New York in 1905, stating his profession as barrister, though there’s noevidence that he practiced. On the editorial staff of Encyclopedia Brittanicafrom 1902 to 1905, in 1905 Raynes founded a newspaper in Nairobi, The Leader,which he edited and managed from 1905 to 1906. Editor for The New StandardDictionary from 1910 to 1913, National Geographic Magazine from 1913 to 1914,and The New International Encyclopedia from 1914 to 1915, Raynes became foreigneditor of The Literary Digest in 1914. His 1913 arrival in New York shows he was then a journalist living inWashington, D.C. He appears in a New York City directory for 1916 at 113 East28th Street. Though not a member, he contributed an article to the Journal ofthe American Society for Psychical Research in 1917. In 1918, Raynes was masterof Adelphic Lodge No. 348, New York, which lodge formed links to theMetropolitan College of the Societas Rosicruciana in America, founded by GeorgeWinslow Plummer. Registering for the American draft in 1918, as resident of 340Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, he was employed as an editor for Funk andWagnall’s. Suspiciously (from the intelligence point of view), in 1918/1919Raynes lied about his father’s birthplace (claiming he was American-born) toobtain American citizenship, enlisted or was drafted into the U.S. Army as aprivate, to serve as a financial assistant for the Inter-Allied RhinelandCommission, the postwar occupation administration in Coblenz. Raynes may havebeen a British intelligence agent or asset working in Washington, D.C., NewYork, and postwar Germany. In the Simon Iff story “What’s in a Name?” Crowleyresorts to fiction to recount his own arrival in New York in 1914, when he mayhave been traveling with the fore-knowledge of British Naval Intelligence. Metat the dock on arrival in New York by “Keynes Aloysius Wimble” (i.e., Raynes),Iff is immediately taken to a country estate. Raynes himself reappears after the war as headmaster of St. George’s, SouthAfrica’s oldest grammar school, in Mowray, Cape Town (1923–1926), a curious leapfrom army private. In June 1929 he contributed an article, “The AllegedRosicrucian Origin of Freemasonry,” in the June issue of the S.R.I.A. (SocietasRosicruciana in America) journal Mercury, credited to Maitland A. T. Raynes 32°.The 1927 edition of New International Encyclopedia refers to him as MaitlandAmbrose Raynes, Ph.D., foreign editor of The Literary Digest. Arriving inPlymouth, England, from South Africa in January 1935, with Mary Maitland Raynes(with whom he had traveled to Canada and the United States in previous years),he gave her address as Tintagel, Cornwall, and stated his profession as “Bishopof the Orthodox Eastern Church,” giving Plummer’s address on 101st Street, NewYork, as his address. Visiting America frequently in the 1930s, he gave hisprofession as bishop and employment as an editor of the National GeographicMagazine in Washington, D.C. Entering the United States in October 1935 thetitle “Bishop Ambrosius” was added to the manifest; his residence, CapeProvince, South Africa. Bertil Persson’s paper “A Brief Biographical Sketch onWilliam Albert Nichols” (Solna, Sweden: St Ephrem’s Institute, 2000, atwww.thedegree.org/csism.html [http://www.thedegree.org/csism.html], accessedJan. 27, 2012) states that Archbishop Aftimios Ofiesh, of the Russian OrthodoxChurch, ministering to the Syrian Christian community in New York City, in“1934, [c]onsecrates Rev. Maitland Raines/Raynes as Chorepiscopus (rural bishop)of the American Orthodox Catholic Church, who adopts the ecclesiastical nameAmbrosius.” Persson notes that on May 8, 1934, Archbishop Nichols, assisted byChorepiscopus Raynes, “ordains priest sub conditione Archbishop George W.Plummer, Primate of the Anglican Universal Church of Christ in the United Statesof America (Chaldean).” Crowley had dealings with both Raynes and Plummer duringhis New York period. Before departing for America, Crowley granted Plummerhonorary VII° O.T.O. and received honorary priest-hood in the SocietasRosicruciana in America on March 21, 1913.*69 [9781620556313_c11.xhtml#fr69] Devotedly religious reactionary Edward HaroldBegbie (1871–1929) began the war urging American alliance against Germany andenthusiastically supporting enforced conscription; Constable & Co. published hispropagandist war verse as Fighting Lines in 1914. By 1917 his thinking hadchanged sufficiently to write in defense of conscientious objectors. No evidencesurvives in Ellis Island’s records of his having sailed to New York in 1914 orany other time. His Chronicle article was possibly cooked up as propaganda inLondon.

Arbitrary illegal acts followed,stimulating debate in the German Reichstag about militaristic structures inGerman society. The events were destabilizing, and the Kaiser lost prestige.†89 [9781620556313_c14.xhtml#fr89] On March 16, 1914, Henriette Caillaux(1874–1943), second wife of the former French prime minister Joseph Caillaux,shot Figaro newspaper editor Gaston Calmette.*90 [9781620556313_c14.xhtml#fr90] According to Crowley’s extant list of phonenumbers for 1917, Carrington’s address was 504, West 111th Street; telephone,Morningside 4753 (YC, OS5, “Phone Numbers.”).*91 [9781620556313_c15.xhtml#fr91] The February 1915 New York telephonedirectory gives Mrs. L.

Marrying John Westley Conroy—who performed as JohnWestley—in Manhattan on October 31, 1900, Helen retained the surname after theirdivorce. A founder of the Washington Square Players, she became their principalactor. Helen was also founding director with the Provincetown Players and amember of the Board of Managers of the Theatre Guild (information courtesy ofWilliam Breeze).*98 [9781620556313_c16.xhtml#fr98] George Augustus Moore (1852–1933), Irishnovelist, poet, art critic, dramatist.

She hung out inthe London bohemian scene around the Café Royal, and in Paris, and had manylovers. In 1908 these included Crowley, who thought very highly of her, and poetVictor Neuburg on whom Mrs. Lamb and Crowley played a trick to initiate him intoadult relationships. Euphemia pretended she was in love with Neuburg, whomCrowley then persuaded to go to a brothel, thus making him unfaithful. Crowleyand Lamb thought it hilarious. It is interesting that Crowley’s sadism withregard to Helen Westley perhaps made him think of Euphemia Lamb, as being likeher.*100 [9781620556313_c16.xhtml#fr100] The number 418 is the Qabalistic gematriaof “Abrahadabra,” according to Crowley, the Magical Formula of the Aeon. Crowleycouches his “revolution” in a rhetorical framework of Thelemic ethics.*101 [9781620556313_c16.xhtml#fr101] Edith Cavell was a British nurse who helpedwounded soldiers on both sides of the conflict but was cruelly executed by theGermans on October 15, 1915, for helping British soldiers escape fromGerman-occupied Belgium: an act provoking worldwide outrage.

He claimed that some of his music wasdirectly channeled through to him from the spirits of famous composers now dead.We do not know if the evening Quinn promised took place.*112 [9781620556313_c19.xhtml#fr112] Florence di Martinprey, née Drouillard,born in the United States circa 1880; arrived in New York from Bordeaux inSeptember 1916, leaving her husband in Paris. Thanks to William Breeze for thisinformation.*113 [9781620556313_c19.xhtml#fr113] By his own account, Crowley had “form”where the verb “to slay,” accompanied by a curious dagger was concerned. In1912, Crowley felt he was losing control of disciple Victor B. Neuburg due toNeuburg’s love for beautiful actress and dancer Jeanne Heyse (stage name, Ionede Forest). A chronic depressive, Jeanne committed suicide over a divorce.Neuburg never got over it, later blaming Crowley for sending him off from aritual in such a state of mind that when Jeanne asked for help, he rejected her.This story has been cooked to imply the actress’s suicide was Crowley’s doing,another myth for sure, but one Crowley helped to stoke. So upset was Crowley atNeuburg’s obsession with Jeanne, and at Neuburg’s subsequent rejection of him,he used the myth to warn of what could happen to those who interfered withinitiates’ progress, almost claiming credit for tipping Jeanne over the edge inchapter 21 of Magick. “The MASTER THERION once found it necessary to slay aCirce who was bewitching brethren. He merely walked to the door of her room, anddrew an Astral T (traditore [“traitor” in Italian,] and the symbol of Saturn)with an astral [imaginary] dagger. Within 48 hours she shot herself.”*114 [9781620556313_c20.xhtml#fr114] Lord Grey at the British Foreign Officeregarded Crowley as an Irish rebel from reports concerning the July 1915 Libertyincident sent by ambassador Cecil Spring-Rice July 20, 1915.*115 [9781620556313_c20.xhtml#fr115] The chief leaders of the Easter Rising werehanged by British military authorities in Dublin after the revolt was quelled.Such harsh, doctrinaire, and politically unwise judgment played very poorly inthe States, where John Butler Yeats wrote to Lily Yeats on May 17, 1916: “Theseexecutions are having a considerable effect here. The strongest element in thiscountry is a humanitarian sentiment outside the ‘cowardly’ South where theylynch negroes.”*116 [9781620556313_c21.xhtml#fr116] Thomas William Hazen Rolleston (1857–1920),cofounder of Irish Literary Society and author of Celtic Myths and Legends(1911). Described by W. B. Yeats as an “intimate enemy” in his Memoirs,Rolleston lived in Hampstead, London.*117 [9781620556313_c22.xhtml#fr117] A remaining “Pasquaney Puzzle” is that theroad frontage of Bristol, N.H., Tax Map 108, Lot 014 matches the deeddescription from Charles to Evangeline, but is completely undeveloped (nohouses), while the adjacent lot 108–15 is where the house sits. Today, the samefamily owns both lots. The house is so very close in description to Crowley’sthat one might suspect it has been either moved or there is an error overprecise lot designation.*118 [9781620556313_c22.xhtml#fr118] In spring 1900, Crowley’s enemies in theGolden Dawn had put his lady friend Mrs. Lilian Horniblow up to reporting to thepolice that Crowley had taken money from her. In fact, Mrs. Horniblow (who hadbeen enjoying an affair—now cooling—with Crowley, while married to an armyofficer) had supplied either cash or a ruby ring in lieu as a favor so thatAllan Bennett might go to Ceylon to save his failing health, and to maintain theaffair. (see my Aleister Crowley: The Biography, 77). With Crowley no longercomplaisant, she demanded the gift returned, a reaction Crowley’s enemies tookadvantage of. When asked by police if she wished to press charges, Mrs.Horniblow declined. Crowley had accepted nothing for himself.*119 [9781620556313_c22.xhtml#fr119] The day of Mercury!*120 [9781620556313_c22.xhtml#fr120] Reference is to Sylvanus P.

She appears in the “letter,” which was Crowley’s Liber 106, “OnDeath,” published under the latter title in the International in 1918.*125 [9781620556313_c24.xhtml#fr125] For members of the A∴A∴, Crowley obtained a“word,” usually through a sex-magic ritual. He then located an “oracle” bybibliomany, accomplished by putting his magical ring randomly in a passage ofone of the Thelema “Holy Books.” An I Ching hexagram provided the “omen.”Crowley maintained the practice religiously until his death.*126 [9781620556313_c26.xhtml#fr126] There has been much confusion about thepainter Leon Engers. I am enormously grateful for pioneering research undertakenfor this project by Frank van Lamoen of the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, inclearing up many lacunae. His detailed chronology, the most up-to-date accountof artist Leon Engers anywhere in the world, is attached as appendix 1. SimeonLeon Engers was born in Antwerp, Belgium, February 22, 1891, the son of PaulaSchwabacher and Mozes Engers (first married Odessa, May 8, 1890). Moving to theNetherlands in May 1892, Paula and Mozes apparently married again March 16,1893, in Amsterdam, giving Leon his Dutch nationality. Crowley accepted a storythat a millionaire had “adopted” Engers. When Crowley first knew the young manof twenty-one, it was as “Kennedy” (or “Leon Engers Kennedy”). Where, or why,“Kennedy” is a mystery, or self-mystification on Engers’s part. It is not clearwhether Crowley knew Engers was Jewish, or even whether Engers wished him toknow his true background.*127 [9781620556313_c26.xhtml#fr127] Previously sited at Boompjes 70 (1904), 69(1903), and 14–16 (1891; Jewish Quarter).*128 [9781620556313_c26.xhtml#fr128] One wonders whether the British consulatereferred to was that in New Orleans. As far as is known, Crowley, strapped forcash for the first half of January, only had a return ticket to New York fromNew Orleans. Mountaineer and diplomat Guy Bullock (1887–1956; elected to theAlpine Club 1919) was posted to the British consulate, New Orleans, in 1913 todeal with refugees from the Mexican Revolution, but moved from Marseilles toLima in 1917; Crowley may have known him (see here[9781620556313_c09.xhtml#p170], ch. 9). Most of Crowley’s references inConfessions to dealings with British Intelligence in New York as far as specificencounters are concerned, are of uncertain date, mixing events separated by timeinto single narratives in different chapters. He was extremely reluctant to givehard facts about intelligence matters in his general defense called “The LastStraw,” intended as a defense against calumnies printed in Horatio Bottomley’spaper John Bull in January 1920; Crowley still hoped to be useful to the Britishgovernment and had no intention of “squealing.” The abiding problem for Britishintelligence where Crowley was concerned was that he habitually put his ball intheir court, but by 1918, as we shall see, his contribution was recognized inselect circles.*129 [9781620556313_c26.xhtml#fr129] Yorke Collection, OS A2, Magical Diary,March 28, 1917–March 21, 1918.†130 [9781620556313_c26.xhtml#fr130] Pirate Bridge; The Latest Development ofAuction Bridge, with the Full Code of the Official Laws, R.

Clode, New York, 1918,second edition), Frederick William Mordaunt Hall was born at Guildford, Surrey,England, “Nov. 1, 1878; educated under tutelage of father and at GodolphinCollege, London, etc.; journalist, came to U.S. in 1903; for five years on theNew York Press and for seven years on the staff of the New York Herald; went toEngland and France in 1916 for the Admiralty and Foreign Office and remainedthere a year; author of ‘Some Naval Yarns’; was with the Admiralty, ForeignOffice, and Department of Information, but actually joined Mission on Nov. 1,1917, to assist Major Thwaites. 193, Madison Ave., New York, or c/o N.

[Based at:]—44, Whitehall St., New York City,and Cambridge Park, Durdham Downs, Bristol, England.”†154 [9781620556313_c28.xhtml#fr154] Established in 1917, the central office ofthe British War Mission in New York was based at 120, Broadway, Suite 2147, withresponsibilities for recruitment, military intelligence, war supplies,foodstuffs, and shipping. The Washington office was in the Munsey Building,Pennsylvania Avenue.*155 [9781620556313_c28.xhtml#fr155] Roddie and Louis were divorced on accountof Louis Zimm’s adultery at his cottage at Woodstock; see, “Artist took Cottagebut Not for Wife,” Milwaukee Journal, Friday, June 20, 1919.*156 [9781620556313_c29.xhtml#fr156] Published in 2002 as The General Principlesof Astrology.*157 [9781620556313_c30.xhtml#fr157] The Sixty was a basement bar-restaurantwith space for dancing, also known as Louis’s or Louie’s. Opened by LouisHolladay in 1915, Doris Gomez was a regular participant in its liberal, bohemianscene. It appears in the Simon Iff story The Biter Bit as a favored lunchtimevenue.1 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt528]*158 [9781620556313_c30.xhtml#fr158] Translated by Crowley†159 [9781620556313_c30.xhtml#fr159] Crowley kept in touch with Helen Westleylong after the end of their affair in 1915.Crowley wrote to her from Tunis August 30, 1923.3[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt530] I turn from singing your praises—in myAutobiography where you receive your due as the “Serpent Officer” in one of themost important stages of the initiation I underwent in America, to recall myselfto you in my character as a budding dramatist. You remember how much you like myThree Wishes and how it was impossible because it would take only an hour and20 minutes to play. Since then I have worked on it to expand it to due lengthand hope to have it finished before the end of the year. In which case I shallsend it along.But I am sure that you remember also that I consistently maintain your rightdivine as the one tragic actress in America worth the name and how I deploredand stormed every time that you were cast for any lesser role. Crowley thendescribed the plot, which was set in the Siberian-Japanese War.*160 [9781620556313_c30.xhtml#fr160] James T. Shotwell (1874–1965), professor ofhistory, Columbia University and Barnard College; author of A Study in theHistory of the Eucharist, 1905; hundreds of Encyclopaedia Britannica articles;and the book series Records of Civilization. Shotwell was to be deeply involvedin the League of Nations covenant and UN charter. Buried in Woodstock Artistscemetery, his gravestone bears a full-size Templar sword, suggesting theneo-Masonic Order of Knights Templar.*161 [9781620556313_c30.xhtml#fr161] Pantruel has a lovely, fairytale qualityabout it, similar to Titurel, the Grail King of Wolfram von Escenbach’sthirteenth-century romance. Pantruel is also like “Pantagruel” of Rabelais’s“Gargantua and Pantagruel,” where the Abbey of Thelema is described—without theag of course. The astral setting is rather reminiscent of engravings in MichaelMaier’s alchemical emblem book, Atalanta Fugiens (1617).†162 [9781620556313_c30.xhtml#fr162] The names in these visions often seem likedream-woven anagrams of other words or ideas, as if overheard from another roomand imaginatively recomposed. Thus Ab-ul Diz sounds like sultan of MoroccoAbdulaziz (deposed in 1908). Amalantrah sounds like an anagram of “AllahMantra.” And because Roddie was a chemist, we may consider its resonance withamyl nitrate, first synthesized by French chemist Antoine Balard in 1844, withproperties later found conducive to relieving angina pectoris and afterward tofacilitating anal sex. Yet these names (and we might include “Aiwass” amongthem) also have an inherent integrity as magical words, familiar sounding yetuncannily otherworldly, from another place, or time, which would be an aptdescription of the astral plane itself. It’s not easy to create such names in anordinary state of mind. Such need conjuring.*163 [9781620556313_c30.xhtml#fr163] After the war Crowley would often thinkthat he had part-flunked his experience with Aiwass in Cairo in 1904 by notreturning to Egypt either to “abstruct” the “Stele of Revealing” or to receive amessage about the essence of the New Aeon connected with the symbol of the“egg.” But he never did return to Egypt.*164 [9781620556313_c30.xhtml#fr164] Now the Stephen Schwartzman building (NewYork Public Library Humanities & Social Sciences Library). Blavatsky quoted fromBjerregaard in her Secret Doctrine.*165 [9781620556313_c30.xhtml#fr165] Faith Baldwin (1893–1978) contributed poemsto the International, later becoming a popular romance novelist, writingAmerican Family (1935).*166 [9781620556313_c30.xhtml#fr166] In the transcript the name was crossed outand replaced by initials, possibly an indication of Crowley’s discomfort asregards his great love.†167 [9781620556313_c30.xhtml#fr167] Possibly Maurice Ricker, who came to NewYork from Iowa in 1918. In 1912, Ricker corresponded with Theodore Rooseveltabout that year’s Republican Convention. He was cameraman with the University ofIowa’s Barbados-Antigua botanical and geological scientific expedition. Apioneer in the development of movies using sound and color, after his retirementRicker continued to work in “moving pictures” as a member of both the NationalPress Club and the New York Electrical Society. Ricker came to Manhattan in 1918with wife and daughter, Helen, who became a popular novel and screenplay writerunder the name Elswyth Thane. Returning from an expedition to the Antilles hesettled into a Brooklyn flat and worked for the government.‡168 [9781620556313_c30.xhtml#fr168] Elsa Lowensohn Lincke, born in Germany in1864; emigrated to the United States in 1886, resident of New York in 1904,naturalized in 1914. According to the 1910 census, she was married to a theatersinger but lived alone with a servant. She inherited $500,000 in 1923. Shebecame an A∴A∴ probationer on February 3, 1919. Her Arabic motto was “No Truthbut Truth.” A musician, Mrs. Elsa Lincke reputedly introduced cabaret to theUnited States. Crowley called her “antique but sprightly” in his Confessions, awoman who “abandoned worldly pleasures for spiritual joys.” He believed herbeing “simple minded sincere and earnest” accounted for her having taken aninterest in Harvey Spencer Lewis’s AMORC, regarded by Crowley as a Rosicrucianorganization only in name, spuriously supported by a fake charter. He consideredLewis a talented occultist whose fault lay only in skewing the truth of hisauthority for the sake of the business but was otherwise sincere. Elsa gaveCrowley money for the Great Work.§169 [9781620556313_c30.xhtml#fr169] Dorothy Troxel (1896–1986), musician; sheheld an associate of music degree from Dana School in her native Warren, Ohio.Thirty years later, she was a geographic names specialist with the Army MapService and began a five-year project: the first Mongolian-English dictionary.When Mussolini ordered the Beast out of Sicily in April 1923, John Bull inEngland followed up with the famous article “A Man We’d Like to Hang” (May 16,1923). Dorothy Troxel sent money to Crowley, c/o Norman Mudd, to stave off ruin,writing to Crowley from 211 Olive Street, Warren, Ohio, on June 3, 1923, “DearMr Crowley, Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law. Your letter camethe day after I wrote. I don’t know how to express my sympathy. It is wonderfulto see you so calm and cool after this foul attack.”7[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt534]*170 [9781620556313_c30.xhtml#fr170] AYVAS = איואס; samekh = 60; aleph = 1; vav= 6; yod = 10; aleph = 1. OYVZ = עיוז; zayin = 7; vav = 6; yod = 10; ayin = 70.*171 [9781620556313_c31.xhtml#fr171] Aleph is the first letter of the Hebrewalphabet; its number is 1: “One” being Jones’s motto as Neophyte in the A∴A∴.*172 [9781620556313_c31.xhtml#fr172] Marie changed her name from Röhling, orRoehling, to “Rolling” “around the time she became a Jungian analyst” (Breeze,The Drug and Other Stories, 648).*173 [9781620556313_c31.xhtml#fr173] “Satan, take pity on my long misery!” fromCharles Baudelaire’s “Litanies of Satan” in Fleurs du Mal, 1857, translated byCrowley, 1943.*174 [9781620556313_c31.xhtml#fr174] Russell left an autobiographical account ofhis own occult and mathematical innovations, and his experience of Crowley, inZnuz Is Znees, filling four self-published volumes between 1969 and 1982.*175 [9781620556313_c32.xhtml#fr175] The Murray Hill Hotel was demolished in1947 to make way for an office block at 100 Park Avenue.*176 [9781620556313_c32.xhtml#fr176] According to previously unpublished,declassified New York Bureau of Investigation reports, filed by agent Frank X.O’Donnell when investigating allegations of “Radical Activities” on Crowley’spart (principally in July 1919), Crowley “appeared before Mr. William Johnson,Assistant to the Attorney General of the State of New York on two occasions. Thefirst on July 17th, 1918 and the second on October 11th 1918. The earlierexamination involved a questioning of Crowley as to his possible knowledge ofmatters involved in the investigations of Edward A. Rumley.” In July 1919 a Mr.Simon of the New York State attorney general’s office gave O’Donnell a copy ofthe examination transcripts that has not apparently survived. O’Donnell,however, makes the point that the second “examination” of Crowley on October 11covered much the same ground as the first but was more developed. O’Donnellprovided a summary of the second examination in his July 30, 1919, report, whichwe shall examine presently, in context (see here[9781620556313_c32.xhtml#p567]).*177 [9781620556313_c32.xhtml#fr177] An advertisement in the February 1915 NewYork telephone directory describes the Hotel Brevoort and the Café Lafayette as“the Two French Hotels of New York”; proprietor: R. Orteig. This would chime inwith Crowley’s love of French cooking.*178 [9781620556313_c32.xhtml#fr178] Now long gone for want of passengers.*179 [9781620556313_c32.xhtml#fr179] Theosophical Society; Crowley consideredthe society amateurish, inadequate, undiscriminating, saturated withgullibility. He dismissed many of its assertions as “Toshosophy.”†180 [9781620556313_c32.xhtml#fr180] Though Oesopus sounds classical—and Crowleyliked it as such—the word is properly spelt Esopus and was the name of a Lenape(Delaware) Native American tribe of upstate New York, particularly theCatskills.‡181 [9781620556313_c32.xhtml#fr181] Pierre Eugène Michel Vintras (1805–1875),led a heterodox religious community divided at his death by Abbé Joseph-AntoineBoullan (1824–1894) who seduced followers with sexual rites. Lévi saw Vintras’s“bleeding hosts” as demonic; Martinist Stanislas de Guaita accused Boullan ofSatanism. Huysmans defended Boullan. See my Occult Paris (2016).*182 [9781620556313_c32.xhtml#fr182] One of the chevalier degrees in the Rite ofMemphis; see Jacques-Etienne Marconis de Nègre, Le sanctuaire de Memphis, ouHermès.*183 [9781620556313_c32.xhtml#fr183] Crowley knew Sarg from London, where Sarghad been staff cartoonist on “What’s On,” edited by J. D. Beresford, later(1922) Crowley’s commissioning editor at Collins, publishers.†184 [9781620556313_c32.xhtml#fr184] While Sarg’s military career might suggestto the suspicious that his unique position fitted him for intelligence work,there is no evidence to serve as a basis for investigation.*185 [9781620556313_c32.xhtml#fr185] In 1930 the current twenty-one-story brickapartment building replaced the more stately three-story buildings familiar toCrowley in 1918.†186 [9781620556313_c32.xhtml#fr186] NYU’s University Hall was built on the sitein 1998.*187 [9781620556313_c32.xhtml#fr187] See my Occult Paris (2016).*188 [9781620556313_c33.xhtml#fr188] Helen does not appear in Crowley’sConfessions or in his surviving American diaries. We owe knowledge of heridentity to William Breeze, who noticed her name mentioned several times in alater diary and her appearance in the Yorke Collection’s “Lover’s List,”mistranscribed as “Helen Bruce Hollis.” Gerald Yorke accidentally compounded theproblem of her identity in a catalog of his manuscripts. This led to biographersconstantly confusing Hollis with Crowley’s earlier lover, Helen Westley.*189 [9781620556313_c33.xhtml#fr189] I am very grateful to William Breeze forsharing with me his original research into the identity of Helen Hollis.*190 [9781620556313_c33.xhtml#fr190] The demolition of the delightfulthree-story, red-brick houses of “Genius Row” on Washington Square Southinitiated one of the first major popular building preservation conflicts inGreenwich Village’s history. Developer Anthony Campagna bought and leveled therow to build a high-rise apartment block, though eventually sold the property toNew York University. The site now supports the modernist edifice known as theuniversity’s Kimmel Center, 60 Washington Square South. Is imagination the onlyway to retrieve what has been lost?*191 [9781620556313_c33.xhtml#fr191] Crowley might have sketched out the ideas,but his principal artist was Helen Woljeska, who also contributed short storiesfor the International and who, according to Crowley’s telephone list, lived at99 Claremont Avenue, Manhattan, with a Morningside number (4102).11[9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt596]*192 [9781620556313_c33.xhtml#fr192] Bertha (or Bonita) Almira Bruce (1888–?)married Albert Ryerson in 1919, a marriage, according to William Breeze, either“of convenience, or of such serious inconvenience it ended very quickly; it wasnever registered” (The Drug and Other Stories, 649). “Soror Almeira” becameCrowley’s fifth Scarlet Woman. She is described as “a splendid child” inCrowley’s short story Colonel Pacton’s Brother (The Drug, 544). Because nophotograph is extant, and we know nothing of her life after 1941, thedescription of her in the story is, as Breeze remarks, especially valuable.*193 [9781620556313_c33.xhtml#fr193] Percy Reginald Stephensen found theinvitation and response among Crowley’s papers in 1930 when working on a fairassessment of Crowley’s career to support the Mandrake Press’s publishingprogram of Crowley’s books.*194 [9781620556313_c34.xhtml#fr194] This was William Elby Allen (1882–1951),appointed acting chief on January 1, 1919.*195 [9781620556313_c34.xhtml#fr195] In the novel, Isabelle Goudie, bored bydull, sexless marriage to farmer John Gilbert, dreams of love and excitement.The Devil appears, and she falls in love with him and he with her. But Isabellemust choose between good and evil. Brodie-Innes (1848–1923) poured into thenovel his knowledge of seventeenth-century Scotland, anti-Catholicism, and thewitch cults and trials.†196 [9781620556313_c34.xhtml#fr196] re “Hugo de Larens”: there did exist,however, a Hugues de Laurens, recorded in fourteenth-century history in France’sl’Hérault region; the origins of this Tuscan aristocratic family are obscure.*197 [9781620556313_c34.xhtml#fr197] See the author’s Deconstructing Gurdjieff:Biography of a Spiritual Magician, Inner Traditions, 2017.*198 [9781620556313_c34.xhtml#fr198] Crowley’s speculation has analogy withspeculations in nuclear physics where electrons under particular heat andmagnetic stresses may cause their matter to lose mass, the mass being speculatedto be in some parallel dimension, capable of “return” and measurement underchanged conditions.*199 [9781620556313_c36.xhtml#fr199] Hebrew for psyche, or “breath of life.”*200 [9781620556313_c36.xhtml#fr200] Referring to Crowley’s “Autohagiography,”which he was writing at the time.*201 [9781620556313_c36.xhtml#fr201] See Tobias Churton, Occult Paris, on theVicomte de Lapasse and the genuine Rose-Croix of Toulouse, pages 166–86. Thewhole issue makes for a fascinating substory but this is not the place to tellit.†202 [9781620556313_c36.xhtml#fr202] The full story to Crowley’s invention ofthe V-sign is told in Tobias Churton, Aleister Crowley: The Biography, chapter26.*203 [9781620556313_c36.xhtml#fr203] There is one intriguing speculation as tonomenclature that Urban reflects upon, that being the possible origin ofHubbard’s term thetan, which has always had the ring of ascience-fiction-derived name about it; one naturally thinks of “titans” and thelike. It is posited that when Hubbard coined the word, he possibly derived itfrom the Greek letter theta, and theta is not only the eighth letter of theGreek alphabet but of course the primary letter of Thelema, the essential Will,without which one cannot will change, or escape from the constraints ofmateriality, in magical theory. Crowley even put a dominant, yonilike theta (θ)at the center of his “sigil of Babalon.” In his Book of Lies, Crowley explainedthat the Greek letter was originally written as image [images/img_008.jpg], notonly the astrological symbol for the sun, of course, but also, with the familiarsolar-phallic correspondence, the symbol of the union of lingam and yoni: thecreative act.21 [9781620556313_nts.xhtml#nt663]The mark of the beast is the sun-moonconjoined.*204 [9781620556313_c36.xhtml#fr204] A pun on the phoenix, the symbolic birdthat rises from the ashes in alchemy.*205 [9781620556313_c36.xhtml#fr205] The U.K.’s Defense of the Realm Act, 1914,which introduced authoritarian social control mechanisms, such as censorship,imprisonment of antiwar activists, while even trivial peacetime activities werebanned, such as kite flying, starting bonfires, buying binoculars, feeding breadto wild animals, discussion of naval and military matters, or buying alcohol onpublic transport.

For reports on Crowley’s activities sent tothe foreign office in 1915, see Hutchinson, Aleister Crowley: The BeastDemystified, 138–39. Hutchinson’s account is convinced of Crowley’s treachery,attributing it to self-serving, self-deceiving, perverse cynicism, i.e., he waslaughing from a perceived high place on all human folly, and never took anything(including writing pro-German propaganda) or anyone really seriously. Thispicture is only won by avoiding considerable evidence to the contrary.22 [9781620556313_c20.xhtml#rn343].

Symonds inquired of (now)Admiral Guy Gaunt regarding Crowley’s alleged treachery thirty-four years afterthe events con-cerned. Gaunt dismissed Crowley as a “small-time traitor” whowould do practically anything for publicity. Spence considers Gaunt sufferingfrom sour grapes, or a confused memory.26 [9781620556313_c20.xhtml#rn347]. Fatherland 4, no. 16 (May 24, 1916).27 [9781620556313_c20.xhtml#rn348].
