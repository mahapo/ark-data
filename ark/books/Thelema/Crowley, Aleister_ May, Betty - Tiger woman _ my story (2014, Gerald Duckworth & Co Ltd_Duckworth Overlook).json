Some of them will actually know me and remember thethings and the people I am going to speak of. They will recognize several of theindividuals who are called only by their Christian names, or who are onlydescribed by their appearance or most marked characteristics. For these it maybe interesting to recall the old times of before and during the war—now thateverything is so altered— and the adventures that we used to have in those days.But there will be a great many people who will never have heard of me at all,and for them I want to explain a little of myself if possible, before I begin. Iwant this to be a frank history of my life. By this I mean that I want people torealize what I am really like. A lot of the stories I am going to tell are, Isuppose, rather unpleasant home-truths about myself, but I am not ashamed ofthem. They are all part of me, and when you have read my story perhaps you willunderstand in some way how my character has been formed.When I read through this book the thing that struck me most was what an excitinglife I have had up to the present (you see I am not even middle-aged yet). Butin spite of this it has not really felt so exciting while it has all been goingon. Of course bits of it have been thrilling, I admit. But then for long periodsnothing seemed to happen to speak of, and I had no money or was terribly boredor something like that, and things did not seem bright at all. I supposeeverybody’s life really feels much like that however exciting it is, and Ishould be grateful for the experiences that I have had. I have only written downevents that I thought would interest everybody because I thought otherwise noone would want to read the book, and one thing I should like to make clear isthat the things which are likely to interest everybody are not always the thingsthat have interested me most. I have had all sorts of experiences which mean alot to me but would not interest anyone else to hear about. I suppose everywoman carries in her heart memories that mean more to her than all sorts ofexciting stories she might be able to tell. It is certainly so with me, and ifthere are people who know me and read my story and wonder about why this personor that episode has not been mentioned, it is possible that they may find anexplanation in what I have said above. On the other hand, it may just be I thathave forgotten, for it has not always been easy to remember every incident inone’s life.First of all you must realize that I have never tried to be ordinary and to fitin with other people. I have not cared what the world thought about me, and as aresult I am afraid what it thought has often not been very kind. I have had loveaffairs, some of which you will hear about and some of which you will not hearabout. I have often lived only for pleasure and excitement, but you will seethat I came to it by unexpected ways. Fate seems to have led me there, for Ihave lived in a world which I was certainly not born to. In fact nothing couldhave been further from it than the surroundings in which I was brought up. Andnow having said this, I hope everyone will feel in a sympathetic mood to hearabout me. If they do not they had better put my book down, for I am going totell my story in the same sort of way that I have lived my life."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ICHILDHOODMyself—Earliest memories—My coster grandmother—A suicide—I am sent to live withmy father—My father’s had character—His arrest by my grandfather—Life on abarge—I dance for some sailors—I go to Somerset—The schoolmaster— I am sent toLondon—The beginning of adventures.TIDAL BASIN, where I was born, and spent most of the single-figure years of mylife, is as everyone knows, one of the poorest and most squalid districts inLondon. At the time when I can first remember, my father had already left us,convinced, I suppose, that having begotten four children, nothing further couldreasonably be expected of a man. And even the law failed to extract from him anycontribution towards our support, although I believe he used to be sent toprison at intervals for refusing to pay anything towards his family’s upkeep.We lived in one room, with a scullery attached, containing a round white copper.The only other furniture consisted of a table, one or two very broken-downcane-bottomed chairs, and a carpet chair in which my mother used to rest of anevening, with a folded ironing-blanket for a cushion. We did not possess a bed,and at night used to sleep on bundles of rags in the various corners of theroom.My mother was half French, and at this time still very good-looking. Not morethan five feet in height —I am no taller—she had a rich olive complexion andbeautiful dark eyes set very wide apart, which I have also inherited. Her nose,however, was better than mine, being a delicate aquiline, whereas mine is, to behonest, rather a snub. Her life must have been a hard one. She had four childrento bring up on a total income of ten shillings a week. And to earn this meagresum she had to work twelve hours a day at a chocolate factory. It would havebeen excusable if she had neglected us. The amount of work she had to do in thecourse of the day was simply awful, for I am afraid that as a family we needed agood deal of looking after. I suppose we inherited this from our father. But solong as my mother’s strength held out she never surrendered. Although tenshillings a week was not enough to keep us warm and well fed, she at leastpersevered in keeping us and our home clean. Only the black-beetles escaped allher efforts. I shall never forget the sensation of crushing them under my barefeet. They used to give a sort of scrunch.Sometimes, but not often, she was able to bring us back some chocolate from thefactory. Oh ! the delight of that chocolate ! It was almost worth beinghalf-starved to enjoy it as we did.I have only one more recollection of these very early days, and that is of atall bearded man who visited us one winter evening. Ordinarily we should haveretired for the night by the time he arrived, but apparently my mother wasexpecting him, for she kept the lamp burning. I imagine he was a seaman as hewore small gold rings in his ears. He stayed for a long time, and my motherseemed to enjoy his company. Before he went he took me on his knee and playedwith me.From this time onwards he always used to come and see us when his ship was inport, and we got quite used to him. I was always his favourite and he neverplayed with any of the others. His nickname for me was “The little flea,” onaccount, I suppose, of my small size and great quickness of body and mind.When we were a little older my brother and I used to be sent round to mygrandmother’s house every Monday morning to fetch the vegetables for our weeklypot of soup. This was rather an event in our lives. Not only was it the mostimportant meal of the week but also one never quite knew what sort of a mood mygrandmother might be in. Anything might happen. My grandmother was a remarkablewoman, a real coster. Her hair, which she always wore heavily greased and drawnstraight back in a tight little knot at the back of her head, was as white asher invariably clean apron. Her face was equally white, making her eyes appearvery conspicuous. My brother called her “two holes burnt in a blanket,” andinfuriated her by calling this after her in the street and running away beforeshe could catch him. She was a really great character and people were veryafraid of her.I often used to walk with her to the market. As soon as we got there we used togo into a pub, where she bought me the same drink as she was havingherself—usually either gin or porter. Then came the actual marketing, afterwhich we had another drink and returned home, my grandmother carrying all herpurchases folded up in her apron.It was at my grandmother’s house that I first came in contact with death. Shelived on the first floor. Below her was a household consisting of a man, hiswife, and his sister-in-law. One day my grandmother told me to go down andborrow some milk from them. I knocked at the door. There was no reply. Icautiously opened the door and, looking in, I saw the wife suspended by astocking from a hook on the door leading into the bedroom. Her face was purpleand her eyes bulged like a fish’s. It was rather an awful sight, and in spite ofthings I have seen since then it has always remained firmly fixed in my memory.I can see the body hanging there as if I had only gone into the house and seenit a few days ago. It is extraordinarily vivid to me.“Can you lend grandma a bottle of milk?” I asked, not knowing how else toattract her attention.When she made no reply I was rather frightened, and thinking she must be ill,ran upstairs to tell my grandmother. Her reception of the news disappointed mevery much. Instead of being treated with the respect due to what I was beginningto think must be important news, I was sent packing, and told not to sayanything about what I had seen to anybody. Of course I told everybody I met, butas none of them could give me any satisfactory explanation I decided to ask mymother as soon as she came home. To my intense disappointment she behaved in thesame evasive way as my grandmother had done. I was not, however, even at thatage, so easily put off, and I soon found out the facts of the story, which wereas follows. The wife was expecting a child and had moved into the front room forthe period of her confinement. The husband, deprived of her, turned to hissister-inlaw, who did not refuse him. By reason of the limited accommodation attheir disposal it was not long before the wife’s suspicions were aroused, andone day not long before her delivery was expected, hearing what she took to besuspicious sounds in the adjoining room, she arose, investigated, and discoveredthem. So great, apparently, was the shock of realizing this double infidelitythat, unable any longer to endure such a world, she decided to leave it ratherthan bring another life into it.Although it did not always end in suicide, this sort of episode was fairlycommon I discovered as I began to grow up. I think it gives you some sort ofidea of the squalor and misery in which I was brought up, and for this reason Ilook upon it as important.My grandmother, I have said, was a real coster woman, and the strain of costerblood I inherit from her has had a big effect in moulding my personality. I am atrue coster in my flamboyance and my love of colour, in my violence of feelingand its immediate response in speech and action. Even now I am often caught witha sudden longing regret for the streets of Limehouse as I knew them, for thegirls with their gaudy shawls and heads of ostrich feathers like clouds in awind, and the men in their caps, silk neckerchiefs and bright yellow pointedboots in which they took such pride. I adored the swagger and the showiness ofit all.My brother and I used to explore together the remotest parts of Greenwich andChinatown, often returning very late at night, much to the irritation of mymother, who wanted to rest after her day’s work. She often scolded us, but wedidn’t care, and returned probably even later the following night. There wereextraordinary things to be seen in the narrow streets by the river. I suppose itwas really a suitable early training for me. It taught me that you could neverknow what was going to happen next.I was, I must admit, a good deal frightened of my brother, and my rebellion waspartly due to his threats, which he was never afraid to carry out. If ever Ishowed any sign of refusing to do what he wanted he would pinch me till I gavein, or push me into a canal. On one occasion, however, I had my revenge on him.It was a hot day and we had walked down to one of those Greenwich streets, wherethere are many little tributaries of the Thames. He was hot and tired, and,thinking it would be pleasant, took off his boots (the only pair in the family)and waded into the water. As soon as he was out of reach I picked up the bootsand threw them out into the middle of the stream. They floated a short way andthen sank.My mother was furious when he returned without the boots, and asked him what hehad done with them. He naturally told her that I had thrown them into the river.I, however, said that he had thrown them at me standing on the bank and missed.Despite his furious denial of this, she believed me. I was always her favourite.Then she gave him a halfpenny and sent him out to buy a cane. He, knowing theuse to which it would be put, spent the halfpenny on sweets and stayed out tillafter midnight. I had never seen my mother so angry. Our escapades must havebeen getting on her nerves. As soon as he came in (without the cane) she seizedhim by the collar and beat him with the rolling-pin till he yelled. It was oneof the moments of my life.But delighted though I was personally with my success, I could not help seeingthat the loss of the boots had just tipped the balance so far as my mother wasconcerned. Her powers of resistance were finished. It was therefore no surprisewhen one morning a few days later my brother and I were sent to my father with anote explaining that henceforward we should have to live with him.This was the first sight I had of my father. He was lying on a filthy couch halfcovered with a rug. As we came in he propped himself surlily on one elbow. Hewas wearing a collarless grey shirt and leather braces, I remember. His face wasalmost fleshless, and the working of his loose-lipped mouth had creased thetightly-drawn skin from his temples to his jawbone. His eyes were light blue,rather crazy and dangerous-looking, and very bloodshot. His right eyebrow wasalmost obliterated by a scar which kept the eye beneath it unnaturally open. Helooked absolutely devilish. I was terrified of him and dreaded what our life wasgoing to be like here. I wished I had behaved a little better to my mother, whothen might have kept us with her. I now realized how silly I had been.At the foot of the couch sat a huge dark Jewess, whose one-time beauty wasobvious. She was now enormously fat and shiny, though she was still a finelooking woman. She evidently resented our intrusion, and as soon as she hadlearnt who we were she advised my father to “send the little bastards to theworkhouse.”His retort was to get up from the couch and floor her with a fierce blow in thestomach. Then leaving her to recover, he turned to us and said: “So your motherhas sent you to live with me?”We told him this was so, and it was settled.The atmosphere of the house was very different from that of our previous home.We were never “allowed” in any other part of the house than the room in which wefirst saw our father. Day and night we heard people going up and down stairs onsome mysterious business which we rightly imagined was being intentionally keptfrom us. Later I discovered that the place was a brothel run by the JewessSarah, on the proceeds of which my father lived and drank in idleness.The actual conditions of life were much the same here. We had if anything lessto eat, and we slept, or tried to sleep, as before on bundles of rags in thecorners of the room. In winter my brother and I used to huddle together forwarmth. Dreadful was the nipping of hungry bugs, and the cough of an unknownconsumptive who always slept in the opposite corner to me. In the summer thestench and stuffiness were such that, although it was strictly forbidden, I usedto sneak out and sleep on the stairs, where it was cooler. It was pretty hardsleeping there and you were quite often disturbed by people coming in late andfalling over you, but the breath of fresh air which you got there made it worthwhile facing the discomforts. The first time my father found me there he gave mea long lecture—I honestly believe he felt he was doing something towardsredeeming a misspent life by keeping his children from knowledge of evil—andthreatened, if he caught me there again, to whip me with an engineer’s steelfoot-rule that he was carrying. I disregarded his threat, thinking that bullythough he was he would not whip me. The next time he caught me, however, he wasin a less sentimental stage of drunkenness and carried out his threat.He was naturally cruel, and when drunk, as he usually was, he became a fiend.One of his favourite amusements was to set our two dogs, Nigger and Rags, tofight one another. Or if he saw a cat in the street he liked to pick it up byits tail and crash out its brains against a wall. The one virtue he bothpossessed and respected was bravery. He feared no man in Limehouse, and incertain moods he would go out into the street and shout, “Come out, you ——s andfight.” Only one man ever answered the challenge, and he had to be taken to thehospital in an ambulance. He trained my brother to be like himself. When onlyeight years old he was beaten in a fight by a much larger gipsy boy and camehome crying to my father, who cursed him for a bloody snivelling little coward,and told him that if he did not go back and fight the gipsy boy till he beat himhe would get a far worse hiding at home. My brother went back and thrashed thegipsy boy. When he returned with the news, my father simply shook him by thehand.By trade my father was a mechanic, but since he had come to live with Sarah hehad not found it necessary to do any work. He would just sit about all daydrinking and smoking, and if possible picking quarrels with anyone he cameacross and who was prepared to have a row with him. Previously he had beenemployed as a fitter in a gas works, and he was so good and quick a workman thathe had retained his job in spite of his periodic disappearances. Any kind ofregularity, however, he hated. His parents, and my grand-parents therefore, werea cook and a policeman, who had several times tried to put him in the positionof making a settled livelihood. Of the fact that his father was a policeman (hebecame an inspector eventually) I shall tell you more in a moment. It was a mostunfortunate thing for my father. Once at his request they had bought him a friedfish business, for which they paid fifty pounds. He ran it for two days, and onthe third sold it, stock and all, for a pound. Another time they bought him afruit barrow for five pounds, and he sold it for half a crown. I am rather likehim in money matters.My removal from Limehouse was very sudden and rather a shock. I was awakened inthe middle of the night by the sound of someone banging on the door. It waspitch dark. I huddled into my corner, covered myself with the rags I had beenlying on, and kept perfectly still, hoping I should not be noticed. Then I hearda match being struck and a voice inquiring for my father. I was sweating withterror. Deliberate footsteps approached the corner where my brother wassleeping, and the voice said, “Do you know where Father is, sonny?”“No,” came my brother’s piping reply. “Maybe he’s upstairs.”The footsteps went away and the door was shut. But the lamp was left burning, soI knew that the business, whatever it was, was not finished yet.“Who was he?” I whispered to my brother.“A copper,” he whispered back.“What does he want Dad for?”“I don’t know.”We waited for a few minutes. Nothing happened, though we heard the policeman’ssteps. Then there was a bit of a scuffle and we heard someone swearing at thetop of their voice.The door opened again and the copper re-entered, leading my father, protestingviolently, by the arm. My father was wearing handcuffs. It was only then that Isaw who the policeman was. It was my grandfather, who was an inspector ofpolice. He had warned my father over and over again that this would happenunless he turned over a new leaf and now it had come to this. He had been sentto arrest him. It was an extraordinary thing to happen.My grandfather told us to get up and dress, which was unnecessary, as we alwaysslept in our clothes. He was very gentle with us, and said we should be quiteall right, but we must come along with him. He then took me by the hand,gripping my father’s arm with his other, and led us out into the street. We madea lot of noise going down stairs. Our footsteps sounded very loud. Mygrandfather’s firm and heavy, my father’s shuffling and reluctant, though he didnot actually try to get away, my brother’s quicker, my own tiny ones patteringand timid. They must have sounded very funny.At last we came to a building with a blue lamp over the door, into which we weretold to go. Inside we were separated, and I was taken to a cell with quite acomfortable bed in it, and locked up for the night. I soon went to sleep.Next morning they brought me a cup of tea and some bread and margarine—thenicest food I had ever tasted. At ten o’clock we were brought before themagistrate. I did not understand what the discussion was about, but one of theincidents of the trial was that my grandmother, who was the only person myfather was at all afraid of, was so angry with him for bringing public disgraceon the family that she rushed up to him and hit him hard over the head with thethick rolled umbrella she always carried. There was a frightful scene Iremember. I heard the magistrate say, “And the little girl can go to hergrandmother’s.”This was my other grandmother—my father’s mother. I was handed over to her assoon as the case ended. But instead of keeping me she sent me to an aunt and herhusband, with whom I lived on a barge for the next few years.My father, I heard later, was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment, after whichhe and his twin brother went out to Canada, and joined the mounted police, wherethey gained credit for their bravery. When the war broke out my father joinedthe first Canadian contingent that came over here. He never got to the front,however, where he would probably have done well, but catching a chill while intraining on Salisbury Plain he died of double pneumonia.My life now changed completely. It became much duller for a bit, but it was alsoa good deal more comfortable. I was properly fed and looked after. However, I amnot sure that I was really grateful for the change.All day long my uncle used to sit grasping the tiller in one hand and the bowlof his short-stemmed clay pipe in the other, with his eyes fixed in a very firmstare on some point a few feet above the beautifully carved green and yellowfigurehead, as if he were slowly considering whether it was worth whilerecollecting all his adventures—though his meditations were more probablyconcerned with the question of dinner. The stream brushed the sides of the boatas slowly as can be imagined, and the landscape always seemed to be the same.Sometimes I wondered whether I should ever get away from these rivers and canalsand see the life that must be going on in the world on shore.I was a little brown-faced marmoset, dressed in a starched white frock, and theonly quick thing in this very slow world. I skipped about, getting in my aunt’sway in the tiny kitchen, or else dirtied my clothes and myself by playing amongthe cargo, and generally I was getting into trouble in some way or another.My aunt and uncle were, I suppose, very kind to me. They washed me a good deal,forbade me to use certain words, brushed my hair far longer than I thoughtnecessary, insisted on me cleaning my teeth twice a day, and taught me theLord’s Prayer.“The poor child,” I once heard my aunt say, “has had no proper unbringing. She’sa regular little savage.” My nature, however, was then as now not very tractableto “improvement.” I have never wanted to be different from what I am, and havejealously repelled or fled from any influence that seemed likely to alter mypersonality. I chafed under the restraints and monotony of life on the barge,and was for a time sulky and miserable. My aunt and uncle took no notice of me.This feeling of neglect reached a climax one evening when we had moored for thenight after unloading our cargo at a wharf near Chelsea. I had been ashore—arare pleasure—and had spent the few pence I possessed on a scarlet handkerchief,which I tied round my head, and which I felt sure looked very becoming. Onreturning to the barge I ran up to my aunt to show it to her, saying, “Don’t youthink it’s pretty?” She looked up from her work crossly and replied, “What? Thatthing on your head? Don’t be so silly.” I stamped out of the cabin in tears.Nobody cared a bit about me. I didn’t matter. I would run away and find somepeople who did, which would be easy. Of that I had no doubt. I knew I was notdestined to live and die unnoticed. I knew even then that my life was not to bean ordinary one.And so I went to sleep, bitter and miserable. However, as it happened, I was onthe point of discovering that everybody did not think like my aunt and uncle. Iwas going for the first time to take a real line of my own.The next morning I was surprised, on looking out of the minute window, to seethat a big ship had drawn up alongside us during the night. I dressed, put on mydespised headdress, and went out to look at it. As soon as I emerged a bunch ofsailors on the deck called down to me, “Hullo, kid.” Then some impulse or otherurged me to dance for them. I had never danced before, but it came quite easilyto me. They were delighted, and threw me pennies. I danced more and more, andeven sang, and they threw down more pennies, and at last a sixpence or two. Theywere enthusiastic about my performance. I was delighted. At last someone seemedto understand and appreciate me. Perhaps life was not going to be so bad afterall.After this I would always dance whenever we were near a ship, which happenedquite fairly often, and, as all sailors seemed to like watching me dance, soon Ibecame quite well known up and down the river.Some time after this—I really cannot remember exactly how old I was when variousthings happened—it was decided that a start ought to be made with my education.I was sent to another aunt, who had a farm in Somerset, and for the next fewyears I attended the village school. I do not think I managed to learn very muchthere. In fact lessons rather bored me, but even here I got to know more aboutlife, and it was from here that I was to start off on my real career.This country existence was as strange to me as I myself no doubt was to thepeople I found myself among. For a week or so I found it lovely. To be awakenedby the crowing of cocks, to open my eyes upon fruit trees gently swaying againsta blue sky, to dress, eat a large breakfast (bits of straw still sticking to theegg shells) and then proceed down the path which divided the oats from thebarley, and across the wide village green where the ducks quacked round myankles, to the village school standing next to the church. I entered joyouslyinto the reality of what I now know was a childish dream. I played my part ashappily, as wholly, as singly and as passionately as only those can who halfknow they are playing a part. I dangled my sun-bonnet by its strings. I stuckpoppies and daisies in my hair. I was plump and brown and healthy. Two boys fromthe grammar-school fell in love with me.I always went about attended by a contingent of grammar-school boys. They werefor the most part older than I, but they had not had my experience. I was theacknowledged leader. What games we had! What scrapes I led them into!—alwaysescaping the blame myself on the ground of being only a little girl. I taughtthem to get drunk on cider, and when they became accustomed to that I stole myaunt’s burgundy and filled the bottle up with water. These things may soundrather silly, but I think they show the direction which I was going to take, andfor this reason they rather amuse me to remember and to tell you about.One of our most amusing exploits was my revenge on a priggish little girl calledEdith, the chemist’s daughter, who told tales about me to the schoolmistress.Her parents were very proud of her, and every Sunday used to dress her up in themost elaborate frocks, with huge sashes and hair ribbons to match. I thought ofsomething. I went out and bought a packet of drummer dyes which I dissolved in alarge rainwater butt. Then I detailed some of my cavaliers to isolate andcapture the little beribboned horror, whom we immersed, finery and all, in themixture I had prepared. We left her screaming and clinging to the edge of thebutt, and withdrew to enjoy her struggles. At length she had to give up callingfor help that showed no signs of being forthcoming, and to climb out by her ownefforts, derisively encouraged by her tormentors. Her appearance when she dideventually emerge, an awful, bedraggled mess, weeping indigo tears, andspluttering threats of the penalties she would see were inflicted on us, was asight on which any inhabitant of this sad world could close his eyes with acontented sigh.The years passed in this way, and without knowing it I began to grow up. Isuppose in a way this time in the country was a happy one. Nothing muchhappened, but then I did not expect anything much to happen. It was a sort ofrest to prepare me for the sort of thing that was to come. One of the masters ofthe grammar-school had meanwhile been taking an interest in me. We met for thefirst time outside the school gate, where I was waiting for my friends to comeout. He was a youngish man with a clean-shaven florid face and a largeletter-box of a mouth, through which he uttered slightly facetious remarks in aclipped and, to me, unfamiliar accent. He always wore grey flannel trousers, atight-fitting cloth cap, and a sports coat with sleeves that looked about aninch and a half too short. But although his manner was outwardly ratherdomineering and patronizing, I felt that he was sad. He might have beenambitious in his boyhood, or perhaps he might have been in love, though thisseemed impossible to me. But whatever he may have longed for, I felt sorry forhim. With me he seemed to be able to recover for the moment some of his lostdreams.For my part I learned a great deal from him. He was one of the first culturedmen I had ever met, and I naturally love culture. He used to take me for longwalks on Sundays, during which with infinite patience he would try to reveal tome spiritual pleasures of which I had never before had an inkling. For this oddman had an enthusiasm for Keats, and knew nearly all his poems by heart. It musthave been pleasant for him to find a sympathetic, if not well-read, listener.For a long time we used to go about together. The understanding between us grewmore and more strong. I can hardly say, in the light of what I have learntsince, that we were in love. At least perhaps he was. Certainly I was fond ofhim. And thus things went on until we were more intimate than my aunt and therest of the village gossips thought proper. I see now looking back on it that itwas a relationship that could not last. I do not think either of us wasaltogether to blame. After all, he was lonely. There was no one in theneighbourhood he could meet on equal terms or whom he could talk to about thethings he loved. I myself at this time had not been very happy with the people Iknew. I longed for a bigger life, and I felt that such a life did really existsomewhere if only I could get to it. By his conversation this man had shown mesomething of a world I had hardly dreamed of. But none of this was considered tobe of any account by everyone else. There was a great deal of fuss, and it wasmade clear to me that unless the friendship came to an end it would be theschoolmaster who would be made to suffer. I did not take all this lying down,but I could not do anything to prevent it. The result was that after a rathertearful scene with my aunt I was packed off with a few pounds to make a start inlife somewhere else. And so in sorrow and not a little fear I found myself oneday in the train bound once more for London.image [images/f031-01.jpg][Basil.BETTY MAY [06_illustrations.xhtml#fig_02]What did I think of on that journey? Did I reflect— after I had produced myticket—that the departing landscape (I forget whether it was summer or winter,or harvest or seed-time) was perhaps symbolic of lost innocence? Did I realizethat I had finally cast off the comfortable shackles of childhood, and was beingwhirled, as the novelists say, at the rate of sixty miles an hour—why alwayssixty miles an hour?—towards London, into whose midst I should so soon behelplessly sucked ? I wish I could remember the answers to these questions, butI have really forgotten, and so if I want my readers to believe in the truth ofthese memoirs I will not try to imagine these things but will just admit thisfact to them. Certainly I suppose I ought to have been thinking on these lines,and those who happen to read this book may take it that I actually did so—whichis, after all, as likely as not. If they so desire, let them be assured, too,that the ticket collector was a fat man with a squint, who had a wife and threechildren at home, and advised me where to go when I arrived in London.He may indeed have done so for all I can remember, since it is certain that Ishould not have taken his advice. In a way I was rather excited to be on my ownat last. I now knew that I was in for some adventure. I did not know where Ishould find it, but I felt pretty sure that it would appear soon. I went, as ithappens, straight to the Commercial Road, a district I had been familiar withbefore I went to the country, where I immediately bought myself some “grown up”clothes, a skirt that would have touched the ankles of the person it wasdesigned for—worn by me it not only threatened to trip me up at every step, butwas in serious danger of slipping off altogether—and a monstrous hat, trimmedrather like an old-fashioned ship under full sail, which the secondhand dealerassured me was exactly how hats were being worn at Ascot and Goodwood that year.Thus arrayed, I stumbled out into the street, clutching anxiously at the foldsof my absurd skirt with one hand, and with the other continually feeling for thesmall sum of money with which I had to make my start in life without furtherhelp from others, to assure myself that it was still there—a comical sight. Fora long time I wandered about, not knowing what to do or how to get a room, untilI encountered a young Jew, who took me into a pub and gave me a gin, the first Ihad had since going to the market with my grandmother, many years before. In thepub a kindly woman asked me how old I was, and offered to take me home with herto sleep. I gladly availed myself of her compassion, but could not bring myselfto tell even her the reason why I had come to London.This was a real bit of luck, of course. Goodness knows what would have happenedto me if this woman had not looked after me at that moment. As it was, althoughI was not with her for long, I got used to being in London and became more fullof confidence.A short time later my protectress was compelled for business reasons to leave mein a public house with some friends, who promised to see me home. A well-dressedman, however, came in shortly after she had left, who showed a good deal ofinterest in me and offered to take me to the West End. I am never able to resistadventure, and against the advice of my friends I consented to go with him.Their advice was justified by his conduct as soon as he got me alone in a taxi.I was terrified. I resisted him in all the ways I could think of. I fought andscratched, and I did not scruple to bite. Failing in the direct physical attack,he fell back upon persuasion—a stage in the winning of a woman which I gather hehad in his previous experience found it possible to do without. He pointed outall the advantages, the clothes, the dinners, the good times, I should gain froman association with himself. But I was not moved. He sketched the squalor andpoverty in which he had found me, and from which he intended to remove me, but Iwas not grateful. He then abused me for a lousy little slut, who ought to beleft to wallow in my own filth. I replied by asking him why he would not permitme to return to it. This infuriated him. He stormed and threatened, and lastly,as a climax, declared that he loved me.As I have indicated, and as the reader will easily believe, I was not at thistime in a mood to enjoy love-making. Fear can turn every prospect and glamour ofromance to mud, and I was frightened. Consequently his abasement won no morefrom me than his assaults or his bribes or his abuse or his threats had done. Ihated the sight of him and told him so. I wondered why men would not leave onealone. They were all right at first when they offered to show one life, and thenat once they became a nuisance.This, or something like it, must, I think, have been the reasoning that led himto the course of action I am about to describe. I suppose he thought thatwhatever he was going to get out of me would only be got after a great deal oftrouble, and quite likely not at all. He probably did not like people like that,and so that was why he acted as he did.The taxi stopped in what I found out later to be Leicester Square. My companionassisted me to get out and led me by the arm to the door of a club—nowextinct—situated close to where the Café Anglais now stands, on the east side ofthe Square.“Are you sure you wouldn’t like to come in?” he asked, while we waited for theattendant to appear in answer to our summons.“I suppose I’ll have to,” I said more sulkily than ever.“Are you sure you couldn’t love me?”Before I could answer, the fanlight was illuminated and the door opened,revealing a flight of uncarpeted stairs, up which floated sounds of music,dancing, chatter, and the chinking of glasses. I describe the scene in detail,because the next moment, without any warning, he pushed me down the stairs andwent away, banging the door behind him."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IITHE CAFÉ ROYALMy first night club—Rosie’s wig—A Cambridge undergraduate— The Endell StreetClub—I am taken to the Café Royal—Epstein—Augustus John—Horace Cole—Epsteinspeaks to me—The Cave of the Golden Calf—Madame Strindberg—“The Cherub”—“PrettyPet”—I go to Bordeaux.THE episode I have just related, or to be more accurate am in the middle ofrelating, is a good starting-point for the next phase of my story. The doorthrough which I had been thrown so violently, shut with a loud bang before Icame to rest at the bottom of the stairs, and you can imagine my consternationwhen I looked upwards to find my pursuer had disappeared.Awakened by that bang to my senses I looked up and around and surveyed a newworld containing no familiar figure—not even his who had been responsible forflinging me there. Next I proceeded to investigate in greater detail the peopleand the surroundings among which I had been marooned.This was my first sight of a life that I was afterwards to know so well. In thecorner a band was playing, and on a shiny floor couples were dancing. The placewas simply packed with people, and the atmosphere was very thick with smoke.Everybody seemed to be talking at once. I felt quite dazed and ratherfrightened, and did not in the least know what to do with myself. I was ofcourse in a night club, but I had hardly heard of such a thing in those days andI certainly never expected to find myself in one. Anyway I had not thoughtbeforehand that I should suddenly be literally thrown head-first into one.Entering the room at the end of a dance I saw only one vacant chair, on which,after politely obtaining the permission of the man at whose table it was placed,I sat down. My intrusion, or more probably the interest the man showed in me,aroused the resentment of his female companion. She began by taking advantage ofmy ignorance to try to make me appear ridiculous, but I was not even then to bemade fun of so easily. My wits were far sharper than hers, and I soondiscomforted her. Irritated by her failure, she became insulting. My nostrilsdilated, as they do when I am angry, but still she dared to jeer at me. Thiswent on for some time. The man was quite nice and talked to me kindly, but shekept on interrupting and being as rude to me as she could. I tried to make up mymind what to do. At length she got up and danced with the man, who would nodoubt have preferred to remain at the table, and as they passed by where I wassitting she looked backwards at me over her shoulder. “She’s a pretty littlething, but it’s a pity she has false teeth !”She said that I—I—had false teeth! This was more than I could endure. I jumpedup and slapped her as hard as I could on the face. Shocked waiters immediatelybundled us upstairs into the street, fighting all the time. I meant to make herpay dearly for that insult. False teeth indeed! I would strangle her for it. No,on second thoughts I would catch her by the hair and smash her face so that shewould never attract another man—that would be a better revenge I decided, and Ihad begun to put this plan into execution. I plunged my fingers into her hairand pulled hard, but the result was not what I expected. I found myself lying inthe gutter, and clutched in my right hand—I could hardly believe my eyes—was achestnut wig.All my anger against her died down on the instant as I saw her standing there,hairless as a worm. Seldom have I seen a funnier sight, and never a woman sothoroughly humiliated. I must say that after this happened she behaved verywell. Instead of being angry, she asked for her wig back and crammed it on toher head, telling me to say nothing about it and asking me to go back to theclub with her. After this she was very kind.When I had done laughing, I returned her the wig, and Rosie and I, for that washer name, went back to the club quite good friends. Soon after this incident shemarried a young man and went out with him to New Zealand, where they bought afarm out of her savings, and are, I believe, living happily to this day. But Ioften wonder if he has yet discovered that she wears a wig.This was really my introduction to the world that I was going to live in for thefuture, and in many ways I suppose it showed me the sort of thing I was in for.Anyway it turned out that the incident I have just told you about was all forthe best.From this time on I began to find my feet. Rosie helped me to find a room, and Ifound that after paying for it I could still afford to buy myself some clothes.In the choice of these I was able to show for the first time the flamboyanttaste in colour that I inherit from my coster ancestry. I could only afford oneoutfit, but every item of it was of a different colour. Neither red nor greennor blue nor yellow nor purple was forgotten, for I loved them all equally, andif I was not rich enough to wear them separately, rather than be parted from anyone of them, I would wear them, like Joseph in the Bible, all at once ! Coloursto me are like children to a loving mother. Each is my favourite, yet I cannever bring myself to deny the others by preferring one.It is very irritating to me that I who always know my own mind should be to thisday unable to come to a decision upon this matter. It is too bad. But I alwaysfeel that I have got my own back when I wear all colours at once. Few people,you will find, if you read this book to the end, can boast of having come offbest in competition with Betty May!Dressed then in the brilliant colours that are my right and heritage, mypersonality burst suddenly forth in its full peculiarity. From this moment Ifelt I was grown up and after the experiences I had had I could now start life.As I looked at myself in the mirror after my latest purchases, in my new fineryI felt I was now ready to descend upon the expectant world.The person, however, who was really responsible for discovering me and taking meto the scenes of my future life was a nice-looking boy from Cambridge, whom Ishall refer to as Gerald. I was standing one night outside the Holborn Empirewatching the people and feeling very lonely when he came up and spoke to me.“Would you like to go in?” he asked.“Yes,” I said, “I’d love to.”So he took me in to see the show and afterwards we made great friends. As Ifound him kind and well off, we saw a lot of each other and often went outtogether. He was charming, and I used to amuse him a great deal by both myknowledge and ignorance of the world which always seemed to him such anextraordinary mixture. I began to get the fever of night life in my blood. Andwherever we went people wondered who was the girl with long plaits who dressedso oddly.Among other places, we frequented the Endell Street Club, a favourite resort ofjournalists before the war. It was here that I met Jack C——, an American overhere on a visit, who was to take me for the first time to the Café Royal. He wasgreatly intrigued with me at first sight, and I liked his appearance. It turnedout that he was a great help to me. I was, I remember, very depressed afterseeing Gerald off on the way back to Cambridge, and could not endure theprospect of going back to the place where he had arranged for me to be lookedafter while he was away. He had made me promise not to go out to night clubsalone, but I didn’t care. I dislike solitude, and if he had understood me hewould not have exacted such a promise.Reasoning thus, I went straight from the terminus to the Endell Street Club.Jack was there and asked me to meet him at the Café Royal the following night.image [images/f042-01.jpg]THE OLD CAFÉ ROYAL. BY ADRIAN ALLINSON [06_illustrations.xhtml#fig_03]I remember there was a very lovely German woman who used to be at the EndellStreet Club a great deal. She was always beautifully dressed and covered withsparkling jewels. She always used to make me, with my two long plaits, feel veryyoung and unimportant. (By the way, I used to put these plaits up under my hatbefore going into the Club, but they usually came down in the course of theevening.) One evening I was standing beside this beautiful German, and I askedher straight out how she came by all her fine clothes.“Would you like some?” she said.She then explained to me that she earned her living by blackmail. She gave me acomplete description of how she worked. She suggested that I should join her,saying that my appearance and childlike looks would be very useful in herprofession. I was terribly shocked and upset by all this. In spite of what I hadseen in the way of vice and crime this seemed different somehow. Anyhow, I wasvery rude to her and we never spoke again.The old Café Royal was a very different sort of place from the new one. It was,to begin with, a real café. There was sawdust all over the floor and none exceptmarble-topped tables. The gilded decorations were as gaudy and as bright aspossible. The drinks were quite cheap. I cannot describe them more accuratelythan that, and must rely on the memories of those of my readers who, like me,knew and loved the Café as it then was. I find now that I am always meetingpeople who never knew the Café as it was in the old days. They always talk of itand think of it as the rather grand place it is to-day.I had never seen anything like it. The lights, the mirrors, the red plush seats,the eccentrically dressed people, the coffee served in glasses, the pale cloudyabsinthe. I was ravished by all these and felt as if I had strayed by accidentinto some miraculous Arabian palace.Though Jack, who knew the Café well, could not understand my enthusiasm, heagreed readily to take me there again, and partly out of gratitude and partly tomake sure that he kept his promise, I always went about with him while Geraldwas at Cambridge.No duck ever took to water, no man to drink, as I to the Café Royal. The colourand the glare, the gaiety and the chatter appealed to something fundamental inmy nature. I took to going there nearly every day, even if Jack could not comewith me. I used to sit at a table by myself, with a cheap drink, coffee orlager, in front of me to justify my presence, my head resting in both my hands,watching the parties of artists and models at the top end of the room. I knewonly a few of their names, although I soon got to know them all by sight. Theywere objects of positive sanctity to me. I never imagined for a moment thatanyone noticed me at all. However, it turned out later that they did, and no onewas more surprised than I was to find this out. I used to invent stories formyself about their careless, wild, generous way of life. I tried to imagine whatit must be like to be made love to by one of those great men, and I envied themodels who were privileged to sit with them and listen to their conversation(whose probable brilliance soared above all the efforts of my fancy), and, ofcourse, to be their lovers. How I longed to be allowed even a sip from thosefountains of wisdom!I arranged these marvellous beings in my imagination into a sort of order, ofwhich Epstein, with his massive benignity and his mild eyes, was the topmostpoint. They became part of my life, and although I did not actually pray tothem, they were as important to me as the gods of any religion could be.Augustus John particularly intrigued me. In those days of course he was not thefamous man he is now, though even then he was obviously a great man. He alwayswore a black hat, cloak, neckerchief, etc., and would usually sit withoutspeaking except to give a periodic gruff order for another whisky and soda.Allinson was another who had no fear of the picturesque and dressed invariablyin a velvet coat and a large stock. He used to play the piano marvellously withhis long, sensitive fingers, and he had a wonderful white horse on which hewould sometimes ride back to his house in the early hours of the morning. He wasalso said to possess a wonderful Chinese bed of incredible value. And Roger Fry,the art critic, Nina Hamnett, whose drawings are now becoming famous—a very goodone of me by her is reproduced in this book—Bomberg, with his great head of redhair, his red beard, and big blue eyes, Ian Strang, J. D. Innes, Rowley Smart(later an old friend of mine), Odell, to name only a few, helped to complete thepicture. All the medical students in those days used to wear side-whiskers andbig, black, floppy bow ties. One of the most amusing of them was Barry Hyde.Afterwards he became quite a celebrated doctor, but he is now dead. Thehandsomest of the models was, in my opinion, Lilian Shelley. And above all therewas Horace Cole, the great hoaxer. His practical jokes have now become so famousthat he is almost a legendary figure, but he does really exist and is still tobe seen. Most of his hoaxes are world-famous, but you will remember how he wasreceived by the officers and men of a famous battleship with full naval honoursunder the impression, created of course by himself, that he was an Easternpotentate. On another occasion he and some friends arrived in Piccadilly dressedas workmen, and proceeded to pick the road up, in which condition it remainedfor some time. Another time he had a certain very famous person arrested forstealing his watch, to that famous person’s great surprise. In fact, there is noend to the stories about him.Now I have told you of my distant, day-dreaming adoration of these Bohemiandivinities you will find it easy to feel the rapture, the ecstasy of joy andfear that I felt when invited to go over and join them at their table. I wassitting, as I have described, with my chin cupped in my hands and my remarkableface framed in my black hair, alone, an intriguing object I suppose, in a way,when to my amazement and consternation I saw Epstein look at me, get up from hisplace, and walk towards me. At first I thought he must be going to speak to afriend at some table behind mine, but no, he held undeterred on his course. Hewas really coming to Me. I was too frightened to smile or to say anythingpolite. I could only stare at him. But as soon as he spoke my fear departed.“You’re very young to be here, little girl, aren’t you?” he said, and I smiledtrustfully back.Then he asked me to come and sit at his table. You can imagine how delighted andexcited I was. Of course after that I met everybody of any importance at all whocame to the Café, as Epstein knew absolutely everybody there was to know. Andthis was the manner of my introduction to the Bohemian fraternity.For about a year I played the part of the baby and mascot of the Café Royal set.I sat for several artists, but not for Epstein, who thought I was not yetdeveloped enough to be interesting as material for his particular style ofmodelling. And I did some of my songs and dances at the Cabaret Club, or as itwas called later “the Cave of the Golden Calf,” our usual resort after the CaféRoyal, the proprietress of which, Madame Strindberg, was one of the mostremarkable characters of those times.It was here that I met a charming man whom I will tell you about. Some peoplewill remember him, as he was quite a character I afterwards discovered and wasto be seen everywhere.I had just finished a song there one night and was resuming my seat amidstapplause when I found myself being spoken to by an old gentleman whose clothesand appearance seemed very unsuitable for the Cabaret Club. The dress of St.James’s Street looked very odd in front of Epstein’s very funny frescoes on thewalls of the club. But he gave no sign of embarrassment, and drank beer out of achina mug as easily as if it had been vintage port or Napoleon brandy. Hisassurance won my admiration. He had followed me, it appeared, from the CaféRoyal out of wonder at my extreme youth. I was delighted with him, and gave hima not entirely untrue account of my life, remaining none the less very strictlyon my guard. I christened him “the Cherub.”After this he became very persistent in his attentions, but our relationship wasthat of father and daughter, with which he appeared quite satisfied, and gaveme, I must say, first class entertainment. We used to dine together nearly everynight, and he took great pains to educate my taste in food and drink, of whichhe was a great connoisseur. I was told that the sauce we were having to-nightshowed up the deficiencies of the one we had had the night before, or that thesoufflé nowhere approached the one of ten days ago. And quite as subtle were thedistinctions I was urged to appreciate between the various wines. Like a pupilin music, I strained my intelligence to remember all these things, and at timesalmost persuaded myself that my taste was as refined as that of my host, whichwas of course impossible, as my palate was untrained, and from inexperience Ihad no standards of excellence to refer to for comparisons.I now see that he thoroughly enjoyed all this pretence and probably exaggeratedtremendously to see how far I would really go in pretending to agree with himand air my own knowledge. But for the mere matter of pleasure I am convincedthat I enjoyed what I ate quite as keenly as he did, though for less goodreasons. Or rather I should have done so had I not feared that, being ignorantof what food ought to taste like, an admission of pleasure might be a confessionof vulgarity. It was unlike me to admit any rules other than my own preferences,and I soon defied one of my tutor’s most sacred beliefs. In England, as youknow, good champagne is dry champagne, and the sweeter varieties are consideredfit only for women and Frenchmen. I happen to prefer it sweet. I know it is badtaste, but I cannot help that. I still prefer it sweet just as much as I did inthose days. So one night in the Café Royal when we were drinking champagne ofespecial dryness in honour of some occasion or other, after taking a preliminarysip I commanded the astonished waiter to bring me some sugar ! He protested, butI was firm, and beneath the outraged eyes of the Cherub I deliberately droppedfirst one lump, and then, having tested the effect, another, into the holyfluid. The monocle clattered against the shirt front at each successiveblasphemy.My time was not, however, entirely taken up with the Cherub. I had made anothermore exciting acquaintance at the Endell Street Club. He was pale, dissolute andsmartly dressed, and usually wore several rings on the fingers of hisunexpectedly large and powerful, but at the same time white and well-shapedhands. I was attracted to him by his skilful dancing, his garish accounts oflife in foreign cities, his lithe brutality and the fear he inspired ineverybody, not excluding myself. He was known in England and on the Continent as“Pretty Pet.” I knew he had a very bad reputation, but no one seemed to knowanything definite about him. It was not known how much money he had or where hegot it from, but he always seemed to spend a good deal. He was a mysteriousfigure.I used to dance with him at the Endell Street Club nearly every night,shamelessly cutting my engagements with the Cherub. I was fascinated. And whenhe asked me to go to Bordeaux with him I agreed without a moment’s hesitation.He told me he could get me a job as a dancer. Now, I thought, I am going to seelife.We embarked at London Bridge in a tramp steamer, and arrived at Bordeaux threedays later, having been delayed by fog."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IIIFRANCEBordeaux—I dance at a café chantant—I fight with Pretty Pet and leave him—I amtaken on as a professional dancer— The Apache—I go to Paris—The Apache gang—Ifight with Hortense—“Tiger-Woman”—I fight with The Strangler— The methods of thegang—The branding—The gang is dispersed—I return to England.I REMEMBER that snow was falling hard when we landed at Bordeaux harbour at 8a.m. I had eaten practically nothing while we were at sea, and was almostfainting with cold and weakness. My unsuitable and very insufficient clothingwas wet through and clung tightly to my wincing flesh. Added to this, thecaptain of the tramp steamer had told me that Pretty Pet was a bad hat. I had nomoney to get home with, and I was still a mere child.We went to the Hôtel Montre, where Pretty Pet engaged two adjacent rooms with adoor between. I had a hot bath and some food and rested while my clothes werebeing dried. By evening I was feeling much happier and went out with Pretty Petto a restaurant for dinner and afterwards to a café chantant. Here we sat for atime drinking absinthe and grenadine and watching the performers on a smallstage at the far end of the café. This I enjoyed. I have always loved watchinganything like a cabaret. And then it suddenly occurred to me that I should liketo take part in it. I thought about it for some time, feeling rather shy ofsuggesting it. At length I asked if I might do a dance. Permission was grantedand I went up to the stage and danced as I used to dance for the sailors on theThames. And as I used to at the Cabaret Club. I still had had no lessons, but noone seemed to mind that. Everybody enjoyed watching me dance. I was a greatsuccess. I was recalled time and again and given a great many drinks. After Ihad finished we returned to the hotel and I went to bed feeling very tired.I had, however, only just switched off the light when the partition door openedand Pretty Pet walked in. Inflamed with drink and leering with befuddled lust,his unattractive countenance (which had, by the way, earned him the title ofPretty Pet) looked unutterably repulsive. I think I took the situation in prettywell. I at once switched on the light and made for the dressing-table, where Ihad left my nail scissors—a flimsy enough weapon in all conscience for defenceagainst a desperate White Slaver—for this I had discovered was my cavalier’sprofession—but it was the best available and proved in my hands sufficient forthe purpose. Pretty Pet was too drunk to see me pick up the scissors, which Igrasped firmly in my right hand, the points protruding between my first andsecond fingers, and the handles pressed firmly against the ball of my thumb—andcame at me with careless eagerness, not knowing that I had a weapon. I easilyeluded his first clumsy attempt to get me in his arms, and ducking, struckupwards and buried the scissors an inch deep in his wrist. Sobered and riled bythe pain, he attacked me in real earnest. He clasped me round the waist, pinningboth my arms to my sides, and pushed me towards the bed. I struggled with allthe strength that fear and hate could give me. He was, of course, much strongerthan I was, but I am so small and wiry that he found it difficult to get aproper grip of me and I kept on wriggling out of his clutches. No one in historycan have fought more desperately than I did to escape the Pretty Pet. With asupreme effort, just as I felt the edge of the bed against me, I succeeded inhalf freeing my right arm so that I was enabled to dig my scissors into thefleshy part of his neck. The pain made him relax his hold for a moment, andseizing the opportunity I hit him as hard as I could on the point of the jaw. Hefell, and I dashed over to the fireplace (which I had not been able to get at atfirst because he was between me and it), and fetched a pair of tongs, with whichI hit him about the head once or twice to keep him quiet. I then told him thatif he moved or spoke I would smash him properly. The threat took effect, foralthough I made myself comfortable on the bed he did not stir all night fromwhere he lay.The next morning I ordered him to get back to his own room, and when I haddressed and packed the few things belonging to me I left the hotel and went outinto the streets of Bordeaux, speaking practically no French and possessing nomoney at all. That was the last I saw of “Pretty Pet,” but I believe he is deadnow. He seems to have died just as much a mystery as he lived, no one knowingwho he was or where he came from.But what a fool I had been ! I was so pleased by my victory that I had entirelyforgotten to get any money, and now it was too late. As the day wore on myremorse, added to by hunger, became increasingly strong.Turning the situation over in my mind, I decided that I must immediately setabout finding some exployment and a lodging. The first likely plan that cameinto my head was to apply at the café chantant where I had been such a successthe night before. An excellent plan, but alas ! I had entirely forgotten thelocation of the café and was doubtful whether I should be able to recognize iteven if by good luck I should happen upon it by chance.My hunger, however, had to be satisfied, and I went into the first café I sawand boldly ordered coffee and rolls. When the time came for me to pay I told theproprietor that I had no money but offered to work for my meal, and asked him ifhe would take me on permanently. I will not tell you exactly what he said, buthe did not leave me in any doubt as to what he meant. He got an answer he didnot expect. I was so angry that I marched indignantly out of the café.I had walked half the length of the street feeling pleased with my retort beforeI remembered that my recent way of getting food could not be repeatedindefinitely, and that I had as yet found no place wherein to spend the night. Iracked my brains to recall something of the appearance of the café I was lookingfor, and of the features of the street in which it was situated, but withoutsuccess. I had relied too much on Pretty Pet’s guidance. In this repentant frameof mind I stopped and got a clear picture in my mind of the street I was in,with the intention of using it as a starting-point for my further explorationsof Bordeaux, which I set out upon at once, reflecting that, lacking as I didmoney and friends, I had the greater need of such knowledge as I could get holdof. I particularly noted, in addition to the main streets of the town, thebypaths and alley ways, that might prove valuable for throwing off the pursuitof either apaches or gendarmes, or even my late admirer.I continued my searching until I was too tired to walk further, and thenreturned into the first cafe that met my eyes. I wondered what on earth I coulddo. There seemed absolutely no hope of finding anywhere where I could so much aslay my head for the night. Much less get a job. I could not of course pay for adrink, but I could at least sit down until I was turned out, and besides—inspite of my previous experience—I had hopes that I might meet with somekindness.All cafés, to be sure, bear a family resemblance to each other, but I feltsomehow as if I had been in this one before. . . . It wasn’t? . . . Could it be?. . . There was the stage—the proprietor. . . . It was! All my troubles were atan end. I rushed up to the proprietor, a kind-looking old man, and said,“I’m the little girl who danced here last night.”He looked at me, puzzled, and remarked, “Comment?”“Qui avait dansé,” I replied, and gave a brief demonstration.“Ah, oui!” he exclaimed and clapped his hands.He was overjoyed to see me again, and gladly agreed to my proposals, made inawful French, helped by much gesture and illustration, that he should take me onpermanently as a dancer and general help.I was given a meal and allotted a bed in the same room as his little daughter.This was, of course, an amazing stroke of luck. It is this sort of thing thatmakes me believe in Fate, and from what followed you will see that I have goodreason to.That night my dancing met with even more success than it had the night before,and my delighted employer very kindly gave me a glass of wine to refresh mebefore I should be called upon again. I drank only half of it before respondingto the clamour of the audience, who insisted on an encore. This time I sang tothem—in English, for I knew no French songs then—song after song, “Theraggle-taggle gipsies,” “The Bonny Earl o’ Murray,” “There lived a girl inAmsterdam,” which I had learned at the Cabaret Club just before I left England,“There was an old woman who lived by herself—all in that lonely wood,” a nurseryrhyme that I had known all my life, and as a final encore, “I know who I love,but the De’il knows who I’ll marry,” a song which I have always felt a greataffection for.It was at this point that a thing happened which was to alter the whole of mylife. It was entirely unexpected and it took such a short time to happen, andevents followed in such quick succession, that before I knew where I was mywhole life had once more altered completely.Returning to my table I was surprised to find seated there a man whom I mustpause to describe in some detail, as it was through him that the course of mylife for the next year was to be diverted in a most astonishing direction. Thefirst and only thing that comes into my head to compare him with is a sewer rat.He had the same appearance, and gave the same impression of narrow-headedmeanness and viciousness. What the comparison does not convey is his air ofvanity and bravado. He wore a seedy black coat, cut in the usual high-waistedFrench style, with the collar turned up, dark blue trousers, pointed brownpatent-leather boots, a scarlet neckerchief, and a light grey cap with a largepeak. He was short and slim—I should put his height at about five feet seven.His eyes were black and beady, like those of a rat, and his yellow skin wasstretched tightly over the bones of his face.“A stage apache,” you will say.“A real apache,” I reply, “and therefore an actor.”I was to get to know this in the future. Men who looked as if they were merelydressed up to look like dangerous characters were actually dangerous charactersand used their appearance to terrify those whom they thought would be useful tothem or whom they blackmailed.I smiled at him before sitting down, but his features gave no evidence that hehad perceived either me or my smile. I took up my glass and was about to drinkwith no further thought of this surly youth when, before I could convey it to mylips, he dashed it from my hand.I slapped his face. There was dead silence, then an uproar. His expression wasthe embodiment of every sneaking, spiteful, cruel, vicious, revengeful passion.I withdrew under cover of the commotion to a remoter table. But I felt hiswicked little eyes follow me through the press. I felt them sticking into myshoulder-blades like red hot pins. Turning my head, I saw he was still intentlyeyeing me, and looked away with a shudder. The red hot pins again lodged in myshoulder-blades. Which was worse—to look upon him, or to feel him behind me likea fiend about to jump on my back ? I could not decide.For an hour I sat looking at him and away and at him again, and all the time hiseyes neither blinked nor diverted their gaze from me for a second so far as Icould observe. It was a nerve-fretting experience. At length, like the heroineof a novel, I felt that if I were subjected to this strain a moment longer Ishould scream. So I walked out of the café, keeping my eyes from him with aneffort, and turning either to the right or the left (I forget which), I hurriedaway as fast as I was able. But in a few yards I knew that the fiend waspursuing me. I started to run, hoping that I could make one of the side turningsI had previously explored. But it was no use. I felt my left wrist roughlygrasped and a voice hissed in my ear, “Come with me. You are what I want.”I wondered if he was going to kill me. After all, I suppose he could easily havedone so if he had wanted to. Certainly no one in the café would have taken anysteps to prevent him doing so. They were all much too terrified. I went, for Ihad no choice. My captor then proceeded to explain, though owing to my ignoranceof the French language I was unable to follow his meaning at the time, that hewas the leader of an apache gang in Paris, and that he was known as WhitePanther on account of his silent and deadly assault in street robbery. All thishe told me with the pride of a nobleman of ancient family proclaiming hislineage.I supposed that only my admiration could make up for the insult I had deliveredto his vanity, and only my praise could revive his self-esteem.It was with this man then that I went to Paris. Things had taken a strange turn,as you see.The headquarters of White Panther’s gang was a cellar in the heart of theGlacière district, where the police go in pairs by day and not at all by night.At first sight it reminded me somewhat of my native Canning Town, although I ambound to admit that it appeared one degree at least more squalid and much moredangerous. From the station White Panther led me so swiftly and by such awinding route that in spite of the most earnest attention to where we were going(in accordance with the resolution I had recently taken in Bordeaux) I soon lostabsolutely all sense of direction. Gradually the alley ways became narrower andmore numerous and impossible to remember, until I almost felt that I was in awarren constructed by some animals and not by men at all, rather than in part ofa city laid out by human beings. On every side ill-fitting shutters permittedslips of light to escape. These to my heated fancy were like tongues ofHell-fire.Suddenly White Panther stopped outside a deserted-looking house and knocked in aparticular way upon the basement door. We were admitted, and I found myself in along room with a bar at one end, behind which stood the fattest man I have everseen. The floor was scattered with sawdust. Spittoons were arranged round theedges, and deal tables dotted about in the middle of the room. The room wasdimly lighted by a couple of hanging oil lamps. This turned out to be the chiefliving room of the gang. It was here that everyone met and where plans weremade. It was also, as you will hear later, the scene of several fights.A number of men and women, dressed in the picturesque apache style, weredrinking at the bar. Still holding my hand, White Panther led me towards them.The conversation dropped at our approach.“Hortense,” called White Panther.At this a dark-eyed girl, with beautiful pointed breasts, stepped forward andlooked at us for a moment. Her face darkened with anger, and before WhitePanther could explain who I was, she rushed at me, whipping out a knife as shecame.It was a sudden rush of jealousy. I do not know what the White Panther thoughtwas going to happen. Possibly he only wished for a fight just to see which wasthe best of us. If he did, he narrowly missed losing me altogether.I was unarmed. It was an unpleasant situation. As she lunged at me I jumpedback, and raising my hands, warded off her blow at the expense of a slit palm.Then before she could recover her balance I managed to leap upon her andwrenched the knife from her hand. I could have killed her, but this was the lastthing I wished to do. All I wanted was to protect myself now and in the future,and I felt that I must show this as violently as possible. I therefore flung theknife away and attacked her on equal terms with my bare hands. Unarmed, she wasno match for me. Seizing her hair in one hand and her cheek in the other, Iflung her on the ground and smacked her face, methodically, with my clenchedfists. I blacked both her eyes, I knocked her nose from side to side, causing itto bleed profusely, but without breaking it. I beat her lips against her teethtill her mouth was full of blood. Indeed by the time I had finished with her Ishould doubt if there was a single square centimetre from hair to chinunbruised. I must say that I was in a frightful passion. I was justadministering a few blows to a spot which seemed lighter in colour than the restwhen White Panther dragged me by the hair to my feet. In an instant my teeth hadmet in his wrist just below the coat sleeve.“Tigre,” he muttered. With a blow he knocked me staggering across the room. Butfrom that time I was known among the apaches as “The Tiger-Woman.”I now definitely became a member of the gang. There was really nothing else forme to do. Besides, I enjoyed this life of adventure, and I must say that on thewhole everybody was very kind to me. Of course there were rather awful moments,some of which I will describe, but being one of them I had to live their lifeand get money by their methods. If people are shocked by this part of my story,I ask them to recollect what were the circumstances I found myself in when I gotstranded alone in a foreign country.All the men of the band carried knives, which they used among themselves at theslightest provocation, and there were always being fights as a result.Among other people I met while I was in Paris was the notorious Mlle Bertrande,who was sentenced a few years ago to a very heavy term of imprisonment. At thattime she was a very well-known figure in the underworld.Among other members of the gang. was a certain apache who was always known asThe Strangler. He was called this because of his way of half-choking the peoplehe robbed. With him I had a tremendous battle. It was over his girl, who was apretty little thing called Rose. She had deliberately kissed one of the othermen in order to make him jealous, but as he himself was always being unfaithfulto her no one thought very much of this. However, one day while I was helping agirl called Felicienne to do the cooking, I suddenly heard some frightfulscreams, and rushing into the other room I saw The Strangler with his hands atRose’s throat. No one took much notice, but I was filled with rage, and seizinga bottle, I crashed it over his head. It stunned him for some moments, but Rose,half-fainting as she was, managed to escape. After a few seconds his sensesreturned and he came at me again, but again I hit him with the bottle, this timeacross the face. I had won, but I felt sick and upset for days after thishappened.With my childlike appearance, my winning ways, my tantrums, and my innocentsmile, I was a perfect example of how appearances can deceive. But I suppose itis human nature never to suspect others of being able to use the same weapons asourselves. Many are hoisted, as I was, with their own petards. Who would havethought this would lead to so much ? In this particular case it was a youngEnglishman who was the cause of so much trouble. I saw him in a dancing placewhere I had gone with some of the gang one evening, more or less on the look-outfor something of this kind, for you must remember that we lived entirely uponour wits. To judge from his clothes, a Harris tweed coat, light brown in colour,a club tie and grey flannel trousers, an Oxford or Cambridge undergraduate. Andto judge from his behaviour he was drunk. He probably had five pounds in hispocket and an unlimited confidence in his knowledge of the world. I had only tooffer to show him something to tell his friends about when he got home,something that would convince them that he knew “his Paris,” and he was mine.My deductions from his appearance were entirely correct. He was not a Sûretéagent in disguise, but a genuine undergraduate, and a very simple one at that.Once I had touched his hand and indicated delicately that I might in the privacyof a cab permit him to kiss me, he would have accompanied me to Moscow withoutfurther persuasion.I took my undergraduate back to our headquarters, where he was, to put itbluntly, made drunk, relieved of his money and possessions, driven in anothercab to an outlying part of Montmartre, and there left to find his way home—allin accordance with the usual routine. The next day the police raided our cellar.Luckily we had received warning a few hours in advance, and escaped arrest bytaking refuge in another of our asylums in the neighbourhood. But the members ofour gang were furious with me, ascribing their betrayal, rightly as it turnedout, to my undergraduate. They demanded that I should produce his body forpunishment, and if I failed, The Strangler intimated, without much good will, Iwould do very well as a substitute.For ages I searched for that boy without success. I haunted the café where I hadmet him and all the others the English are known to frequent. After all, it wasmore than possible that he might have left Paris. It would have been quite anatural thing for him to have done after all he had gone through. But somehow Ihad a feeling that he had not done this, and that I should be able to save mylife by finding him. I searched for him as if my life depended on it—which as amatter of fact it did. At last I found him. I smiled and signalled to him tocome over to me, but he would not even look in my direction. I went and spoke tohim, but he refused to have anything to do with me. I saw clearly that herealized that I was probably at the bottom of all that had happened when he hadbeen robbed in the cellar. I was not, however, at the end of my resources. Therewas an apache cab outside which I hailed by means of our secret signal. I thendescribed my intended quarry to the driver, gave instructions that he was ifpossible to be picked up and driven to our headquarters, and I concealed myselfinside the cab. The ruse worked to perfection. Within a quarter of an hour mycountryman emerged from the café and hailed a cab. Imagine his astonishment atfinding me inside.Once he was inside I began to tell him that I was not really to blame for allthat had happened. I tried to explain, feeling all the time that my very lifedepended on my success in this case, for I knew the apaches would kill me if Ifailed this time.My companion, however, remained quite unmoved by my words. He called to thedriver to stop, not suspecting him to be in league with me. The driver, ofcourse, took no notice.I made desperate efforts to quiet his suspicions. The driver, I said, knew whereto go. He was taking us to my room. I could explain everything to him there. Hewould come, wouldn’t he ?We soon arrived at our destination—not, of course, the same place that I hadtaken him to before. I opened the door and let him pass in before me, locking itafter us to cut off his retreat. I then proclaimed to my friends that here wasthe informer who had revealed our hiding-place to the police.Some suggested death. This I succeeded in preventing, but it was determined tobrand him on the chest, and I was appointed to carry out the sentence. I triedto get out of this, as I felt that I had done enough in the business, and wantedto have nothing more to do with the matter at all. But the leaders of the ganginsisted.I stuck my dagger in the fire and directed two of the men to hold the culprit,while I tore open his shirt and vest. When the dagger was red hot I applied itthree times to his left breast, allowing the iron to sink pretty deep each time,thus forming a particular kind of triangle, which was the apache sign. Thevictim endured the pain without sound or struggle, though his pallor and heavyperspiration testified how sharply he had suffered.The smell of burning flesh sickened me, but much worse was the expression ofutter contempt with which he regarded me just before he fainted. It was reallyawful. Looking back on it I cannot imagine how I was able to do it, for althoughI have this violent temper, this was done in cold blood. I suppose it was theknowledge that if I did not do it both of us would die, which would anyway havebeen worse.He was immediately bundled into a cab and deposited as before on the outskirtsof Montmartre.So I punished the boy who had outwitted me. But he won in the end, I amcompelled to admit. Even now I cannot understand how he remembered where he hadbeen taken. On the way there I do not see how he could have had much opportunityfor observing the route, and few people after the ordeal we subjected him towould have had the coolness to keep a record in their mind of our address andthe way to it. Yet one of these he must have done. For the next day the policeraided us, without, this time, our receiving any notice of their intention. Allthe men of our gang were arrested and imprisoned, and the remainder of usdispersed. For my part, with the little money I had been able to save, Ireturned to England.Such were my adventures in France, and I think it will be admitted that they arestrange enough to be worth describing. I will not comment on them. People maythink what they like about my behaviour, and I have no doubt that many willdisapprove very strongly. If they do I ask them again to remember how I wassituated and to try and imagine what they themselves would have done if they hadbeen faced with the same events. How distant those days in France seem to menow, although they are not really so very long ago. Yet now I know that evenwhile these things were going on I was still a child, scarcely understandingtheir meaning."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IVGETTING MARRIEDThe Café Royal again—Some notable people—The Crabtree Club—Bunny—I get engaged—Igo to Cornwall to be improved—The Rectory—Life in the country—Practical jokes—Iescape to London—Arthur—Engaged again—A surprise marriage.How different I felt. Yet how unchanged was London ! How delightful it was tohave fat, solid half-crowns in one’s purse, to eat marmalade for breakfast andto step out of the train on to a platform instead of having to climb down sixfeet to the ground level. And my friends—how would they greet me ? I wanted tosee them all at once and relate my adventures to them.I was received with great acclaim in the Endell Street Club. Everyone pressedround to hear my story. No one was listened to but me. As you can imagine, Irather enjoyed this. You see, before I had been to France I was looked on byeveryone more or less as a child, and although everybody used to talk to me,this was quite different. I discovered that my adventures had made me important.I told them of all I had done, and all that had happened to me, since I embarkedfor Bordeaux with Pretty Pet. I told them of my fights with Hortense and TheStrangler and many others that I have forgotten. I described my friends andassociates, White Panther, Evil Eye, Felicienne, Rose and the rest, and Iexplained in great detail our methods of working. But of the branding of theEnglish undergraduate I made no mention, hating its memory.Towards the end of my long recital I observed a middle-aged man of pleasant,though not handsome, appearance watching me with attention and admiration. Idetermined to make his acquaintance.When I had done, I stood up and cried, “Watch! I will do for you some dances ofthe apache.”I began to dance, and they stood round in a circle watching me and applauding. Idid all the dances I had learnt in Paris, and watched for the effect they wouldhave on people over here.They were delighted by my dancing, and yet I have never received any realinstruction in the art. Dancing is my natural mode of expression. When I dance Iam one. My mind, my spirit, my me, are then my body, and my body is all and eachof them. I danced and danced, now a flame, now a fish, now a bird, now a flower,now a wind that bends the flower and carries away its scent. I was all nature, agoddess ! And all the time I danced for this one man.And when the desire to dance had gone out of me I sang, still for the same man,whose eyes had expressed admiration for me. Wild songs of the underworld, in mylow crooning voice, songs full of pictures, with sinuous rhythms andpassion-stirring melodies. As I sang I became in turn the embodiment of hate anddesire, anger and despair, jealousy and revenge. I sang many songs until I couldsing no more, and then I went and sat on the knee of the man whose acquaintanceI desired to make, and put my arms round his neck and asked him to kiss me.During this period—just before the outbreak of the Great War—the Café Royal wasin its heyday as an artistic and Bohemian resort. I took up again my oldprofession of a model, and with my Parisian record behind me, soon became aperson of some consequence. In all that gathering of amusing people I supposefew names became more widely known than that of Betty May.In addition to the people I have already referred to in an earlier chapter, thefrequenters of the Café at this time included William Orpen, who was even thenbecoming well known for his portraits, Rupert Brooke, that beautiful young poetwho was to die in the war, Geoffrey Nelson the painter, Clive Bell the critic,Carlo Norway, to whose guitar I often sang, Horace Brodsky, the Russian poet,Rudolph Vasey, who was intended for a priest and used to give parties whichlasted three weeks and who died tragically in a motor accident the other day,Stewart Gray, the famous hunger-striker and leader of the “Back-to-the-Land”movement, Evan Morgan, then a poet but now a rising politician, Ivor Campbell,who was killed in the war, and Flower Ellis. The last three were very fond ofme.Among the models, beside Lilian Shelley, “The Bug” or “The Pocket Edition,” asshe was often called, and myself, were Euphemia Lamb, a famous John model, BobbyChanning, Lilian Browning, a girl called “The Limpet,” who fell in love aboutonce a week, the blonde Jessica, Valda, the ballet dancer, and Eileen, anotherJohn model, who was shot by her lover in a fit of jealousy. There was NancyCunard, Iris Tree, and poor Marie Beerbohm, who has just died, and I sometimesused to see the stately Sylvia Gough there, surrounded by men who werehopelessly in love with her. Nina Hamnett, the painter, was the only girl I hadever seen then with short hair. She had a lovely boyish figure and she alwayshad her own crowd of friends round her, as she was a very amusing talker andquite one of the most attractive personalities of the Café.I should also mention Anna Wickham, the poetess. She was always dressed veryseverely, and had a deep voice that used to frighten me a great deal. One day asI was passing her table she boomed, “Sit here!” I was so surprised that I satdown quietly at once. She began to talk to me about books and writers, subjectsI knew nothing at all about in those days, and at last made me go home with her,where she knitted and continued the discussion, or rather the lecture. It wasvery interesting, but most of the time I was frightened out of my life, so thatI am afraid I did not take it all in. Another very interesting woman was GladysDillon, that marvellous teacher of dancing, who was sometimes taken for mysister.There was Nevinson and his pretty fiancée, now his wife. Alvaro Guevara, theChilean painter, whose portrait of Edith Sitwell hangs in the Tate Gallery.There was Van Leer, then a cotton merchant, who used to give magnificent dinnersand who is now one of the most well-known picture dealers in Paris, and thattrio of musicians who always used to be about together, Cecil Grey, Van Dierenand Philip Heseltine. There was Tony Schiff, who used to give such good parties,and George Hill, who later ran the Hambone Club.There was also Odell, that amazing man, with his noble-looking head covered withlong dark hair which seemed almost yellow. He had a deadly white face and hugeluminous eyes. His hands were long and sensitive. His nails were also very long.He was tall and thin, and always gave the impression of living alone in somegarret and doing all his work by candle-light.There was Jack Coglan, the husband of Happy Fanny Fields, so well known on themusic-hall stage, and Ronald Firbank, the novelist, rich, odd, brilliant.Of course in those days the Café was open all day, and you could arrive there atten o’clock and have breakfast and read the papers, all of which were provided.You could also get a plate of chips for sixpence, which was very useful if youwere hard up. Imagine such a thing in the Café Royal as it is to-day !And then I must tell you about Judah, the manager of the Café, who was a veryimportant person in all our lives. He really understood people, and it is verysad to think that you can no longer see him there, playing dominoes with some ofthe retired French journalists who used to go there. He was very useful when wewere broke, for he would lend us money on bits of jewellery or anything else wehappened to have. Sometimes he would buy things outright, and then you had atime over the bargaining when all dear old Judah’s racial instincts came out.Of course it was not all fun. There was a lovely little model whom we used tocall “Bunny,” because she had teeth like a rabbit. I believe she used to dope,but she had a crowd of admirers and always seemed to be having a good time. Thenshe fell in love with a man who used to come to the Café a lot. She concealedfrom him the fact that she was married already and went through a form ofmarriage with him. Then it all came out, and the poor child got six months atthe Old Bailey. After that she vanished completely from her old haunts and weforgot about her almost entirely. Then she was the central figure of a tragedy.Her dead body was discovered in a flat at Brixton, where she had evidently beenmurdered. A stocking was tied round her neck and there were marks on her throat.Then a man was arrested. It appeared that he had had a quarrel with her, andafter killing her he went out and broke open the till of a little general shopin the neighbourhood. If he had not done this he would probably never have beendiscovered, as there was nothing else to show that he had been in theneighbourhood. In court he said, “I didn’t know anybody could go out so easily.”He got five years for manslaughter. There was poor Laura Grey, who took anoverdose of veronal in her flat in Jermyn Street. She had a very sad end. Shewas found on the floor in a walking costume and white blouse, surrounded byempty bottles and unopened letters and telegrams. I knew her well, and the nightbefore she was found dead she came over to me in the Café and gave me a book shehad promised to lend me. We had a long chat and she seemed quite cheerful. Shewas tall and slim, with a very fine forehead. At one time she had been amilitant suffragette.image [images/f075-01.jpg][Basil.BETTY MAY [06_illustrations.xhtml#fig_04]I used to have great fun with a man called Richard and a friend of his who isnow a very famous doctor. Richard’s family had property near Ryde, and in thesummer I used to go down and canoe there with them. Once I was left alone therefor some days to look after an empty farm, and all the time I lived entirely onlobster and strawberries. And then one day when we were out in a canoe it upset.Richard caught a cold which led to pneumonia, and the poor boy died soon after.It was very sad, and after that his doctor friend would never speak to me. Isuppose he thought in some way I must have been responsible.There was only one change, and that not an important one, in the way of life ofour set from the days before I went to Paris. The Cabaret Club had closed down,and its place was taken by the Crabtree. This was such an amusing place that Ithink I should describe it in further detail for those who have never seen it.It was quite the centre of my life for some time, and many of my most enjoyablememories are of things that happened there.The Crabtree Club was in Greek Street. It consisted of several rooms furnishedwith deal tables and chairs. There were no waiters, as we used to get everythingfor ourselves. There was often not even anyone to take the money for the things.We used to leave it on the counter after we had taken what we wanted. Not onlycould you get a very good dinner at the Crabtree, but if you preferred it, youcould have a meal of bread and cheese and beer, which one could get at any hourof the day or night. There is no place like that now. I cannot think why not,for it is just the sort of thing that everybody wants. But then, things havechanged so much since those days that perhaps it would not be such fun as itused to be then. For one thing, everybody used to do something at the Crabtree.They danced or played or were amusing in one way or another. There used to be astage there for small performances of one kind or another which we used to getup.Hither we all used to come when the Café shut. Sometimes Carlo Norway and Iwould entertain the company with songs, and Lilian Shelley also used to singbeautifully there. At others we used to stage stupendous rags, in which I alwaystook a leading part. I was rather a grubby little creature in those days, withfrizzed-out hair. I really must have looked very odd. And this I remember veryvividly. There was a pole from the floor to the ceiling up which many a time Ihave swarmed to escape the pursuit of someone I had played a prank on. I must,in my calico trousers and red sash, have looked very like a performing monkey. Ioften used to slide down the banister, and people would catch me at the bottom.We seldom left the Crabtree until morning, just in time for a bath at somebody’sstudio who was lucky enough to possess one, and after that breakfast at the CaféRoyal. Sleep seemed a waste of time. It seemed, indeed, as if we never slept.Somehow in those days we could do it. I always used to go to my sittingspunctually, and yet one had very few hours’ sleep a week.I had gone to the Crabtree Club one night with a girl friend and a man to whomthe reader has not yet been introduced, called Dick, a barrister of aboutthirty-five, who wanted to marry me. At a table nearby sat a handsome young manwith staring, expressionless eyes. I had seen him before—I could swear to it—butI had utterly forgotten when and under what circumstances. The thick curly hair,the broad shoulders, the nervous hands—characteristic, as I learnt later, of adrug addict— all these were familiar, but fret and strain as I might, I wasunable to place him. Which was all the more distressing since I was very takenwith him. I was, however, far too much occupied with the sweetness ofhome-coming to think much of this. I asked my girl friend if she knew who hewas.“Why,” she replied, “I introduced you to him in the Café—Bunny N——. Don’t youremember ? He’s a Cambridge blue !”The name Bunny brought the whole incident back to me. It took place before Iwent to Paris. It was very odd that I should have forgotten, for the episode hadmade rather an impression on me at the time in spite of its unimportance. Isuppose it was some sort of instinct for what was going to happen in the future.I was sitting in the Café with this same girl, and being pleased with Bunny’sappearance, asked her to bring him over to our table, as I desired to speak tohim. She complied, and Bunny sat with us for a time, and behaved, I thought,very charmingly. After a while he got up to return to his own party, and myfriend said that if I would excuse her she would go with him for a moment tospeak to someone she knew who was a member of it. I leant back and prepared towatch them go, but they were held up by some more people trying to move away,and from a slight backward gesture of his head in my direction I inferred thatthey were talking about me. I naturally strained my attention to hear what theysaid. But all I could catch, and enough in all conscience, were four words ofhis, “What, that old hag?” followed by a laugh.“Well, do you remember him now?” my friend asked, recalling me to the present.“Yes, thank you, I remember,” I replied rather snappily. Yet for some reason,although I spoke in this way, I had a sort of presentiment that somethingimportant was going to happen about this young man. It turned out that I wasright.But what was I to do about him, I wondered ! I brooded over this question quiteoblivious, I fear, of poor Dick. Should I call him over, or should I go andspeak to him ? The second idea seemed better on the whole, as our interviewwould probably be easier to manage without other people being there. But it wassome time before I could make up my mind to it. Would it be right, I askedmyself, in the circumstances, for me to make the first move ? Perhaps he had nowish to get to know me again. Or he might think that I was trying to throwmyself at his head. On the other hand, it was quite likely that I was making toomuch of a chance remark, probably long ago forgotten. A remark, moreover, whichI was not really certain had even then been meant for me.I debated the matter from all these angles, and could not make up my mind but togo over and speak to him.He stood up, greeted me most politely, and invited me to sit down.“It was in the Café,” I began, smiling very sweetly.He nodded in agreement, but he lifted his eyebrows as if he really was not verysure about how we had met, assuring me at the same time with a smile (I noticedhe had good teeth) that however the acquaintance had been made, he was glad, andwould make no bones about admitting it.“My friend,” I went on, indicating her with a slight movement of my left hand,“or I should say our friend,” I added, “as you probably know her quite as wellas I.”“Of course, I remember now,” he broke in. “She brought me over to your table inthe Café. Oh, yes! But what have you been doing since? I haven’t seen youanywhere.”I gave him a short account of my doings in France, at the conclusion of which hedeclared himself so thrilled that he must hear more about them.“We must meet again soon,” he said. “What about dinner to-morrow night?”I saw that now my chance had come. If he had really said it I could now pay himout, and if he had not he would not know what I meant and the whole thing couldsoon be explained away.I arose and shook my head, saying: “You couldn’t possibly be seen in public withan old hag.” With which I returned to my own table and devoted myselfostentatiously to Dick, making him very happy. Soon afterwards Bunny left theclub.I was engaged the next night to dine with Dick. But meeting Arthur—the man whohad been so attracted to me at the Endell Street Club and the man for whom I haddanced—I decided to dine with him instead.I am afraid this stage of my story may seem rather a muddle as readers may getthese three men mixed up, but it is important that I should tell you about themas you will see that eventually all these affairs affected the others a certainamount and therefore are important, as the end of the chapter will show.Arthur, like Dick, was in love with me to the point of matrimony. He was,however, somehow more impressive. Dick was kind, gentle, unselfish, considerate,and rather boring. Arthur equally kind, but more decisive. One naturally didwhat he wanted. In his company I easily forgot that I had ever been called anold hag.I became engaged to Arthur over the coffee.“Two more brandies,” he suggested, “to drink ourselves luck in.”“Brandy! “I said. “Waiter!”—he seemed to have forgotten that marriage was aserious business. “Waiter,” I called a second time, and when he attended, “amagnum of champagne—and ask my friends over there to come and drink with me.”That magnum was followed by another, which was in its turn succeeded by anotherand another, and in short by twelve o’clock we had finished I forget how many.Proceeding then to the Crabtree, we held a really uproarious party, lasting tillwell after daylight.When I saw Dick the next day, “For goodness sake,” I said, “don’t speak to me.I’m very ill. Go away.”He had, luckily, enough sense to disregard the last command, and sitting down bymy head, easily coaxed me into drinking some brandy and milk, after which I feltbetter.I was naturally in a dependent and suggestible mood. I felt small and weak andunhappy and helpless. I wanted to be petted and protected and comforted. He wasvery nice to me. He held my hand and made me take a little more brandy and milk,and, above all, made no mention of the engagement with him that I had broken.As a result of his ministrations I soon began to feel quite happy.Then he began to unfold an astounding plan. How I ever came to listen to it fora moment I am at a loss to account for even to myself. Looking back, I canhardly imagine how he can have thought of it. But it strikes me that if I myselffind it difficult to believe, the reader will need no excuse if he finds itimpossible, and so perhaps in the interests of my own reputation for truth Ishould leave out both the plan itself and the whole incident resulting from it.However, I do not intend to do that, and I can only assure you that it was onlytoo true. It was as follows.Dick suggested that I should go down to the country and live with his parentsuntil I should be trained enough in the ways of society to become his wife. Isuppose as a matter of fact it was not really as extraordinary as it seems to bewhen I look back on it. I was, after all, much younger then, and I do not thinkhe had any idea how difficult I was to manage.I was sick of London and the life I had been leading. My mind went back to thedays when I had attended the village school in Somerset, when I bounded over thefields by day, and slept at nights, and woke up without regrets, and was strongand plump and red-cheeked and sunburnt, and I wondered if I should ever be ableto recover that happiness, that health, that beauty, or was it already too late.Then, pat with my thoughts, came Dick’s suggestion—my dream come true. Hisfather was rector of a small West Country parish, and I as his fiancée— thisseemed to me a detail of no importance—should go and stay with his parents, inorder to get accustomed to the manners and customs of the people my life wouldbe spent among when I was married. It was decided.My first view of Cornwall was when the weather was soft and pleasant. I arrivedin the late afternoon of a fine day in September at the little station of L——.On the platform a rather good-looking girl was waiting. She was dressed in verythick tweeds, and she asked me if I was Miss May. I said I was, and she thendeclared that she was Dick’s sister Joyce, and had the governess cart waitingoutside. To get to the rectory we had to drive six miles over the moors. I drankin impressions. The sun was beginning to disappear in the west, and its goldenrays made the country-side look more lovely than I can describe. Joyce, Iobserved, knew everyone on the road. This part of the country was not actuallymoorland, but occasionally one got a sight of moors not far distant. The gorseand heather did not grow to any great height. I asked a great many questions,hoping to get an insight into the country. I wanted to know what crops did theygrow mostly. She told me oats. I also questioned her about those buildings witha high chimney, and what looked like heaps of slag. Disused tin mines, I wastold. And she went on to say those other things, up the hill there on the left,were not tin mines but granite quarries.And all the time I was busy collecting impressions and information. I had madeup my mind that I would do my best to behave as well as possible and makefriends with everyone. I would really try to learn how to be a good wife forBunny. I was inwardly trying to picture what my life would be like in thisunfamiliar place. These day-dreams of mine ! I expected that all conversationwould be about simple things. The events of the parish of which life wascomposed would be, to one who like me had moved in a larger world, so small andunimportant as to be a pleasant relief. And the people, the simple old rectorwith his sherry and his memories of Oxford—so I imagined him—his gentle,grey-haired wife, the schoolmaster, the ladies of the neighbourhood, therustics. It would be restful to enter into their lives and problems. Of courseit was all more vague in my mind than I have written it down here, but althoughmy expectations were in a way unformed, this is more or less what they werelike. I had very romantic ideas about country life.When we arrived at last at the rectory there was standing on the front doorstepto greet me—not the dear old lady clad in cap and shawl that I had looked for—but an extremely tall, slim, middle-aged woman, smartly dressed in a grey tweedcoat and skirt, and a suitable country hat, riding rather high on herfrizzed-out hair. I was simply terrified.As I got out of the governess cart she began to talk, and went on in such a waythat I could not get a word in. She asked me if I was tired after my journey andtold me how delighted she was to see me. The rector would be in soon, she said,and he had asked her to apologize for his absence, it was a straggling parish.But I would like to see my room probably. She had told the maid to have some hotwater ready. They dined at half-past seven, but there would be a cup of tea—teawas always nice after a journey, wasn’t it?—waiting for me in the drawing-roomand I could tell her all about Dick. They hadn’t seen him for nearly six monthsnow. It was strange to think of his being engaged, but she was so pleased it wasto such a nice girl. She went on in this way for some time, and although now Iknow that she was trying to be kind and nice, I had never met anyone like thisbefore and it only rather took my breath away. I did not know how to keep up aflow of talk to reply properly to all this.At dinner I met the rector, who was a quiet, grave man, also very tall indeed,who was not a bit like the clergymen I had read about, who had always beenrather comic curates or else dear old gentlemen. He did not speak much toanyone, and left everything to his wife. I felt like a midget in this giantfamily. She overwhelmed me afresh, apologizing for every dish and praising it inthe same breath, hoping I should not be dull, and sketching a terrifyingprogramme of social excitements, tennis, dancing, riding, bicycling—they werequite up-to-date. I mustn’t be afraid—where I should meet plenty of nice “youngpeople.”For the next three months my life was a round of harmless gaiety. I will not tryand describe it in detail. I suppose it is the sort of life that most Englishgirls lead who live in the country, and it would only sound very ordinary andrather pleasant to most people. In a fortnight I knew all their acquaintance. Inthree weeks I was bored to death. Breakfast at the rectory was one of the thingsthat frightened me most. I remember that we often used to have grilled herrings,and the rector’s wife, who was Scotch, used to impress upon me very severelythat in Scotland only the head of the house actually ate the herring and thewomenfolk and children were only allowed to smell it and considered themselvesvery lucky to be allowed to do this even. Fortunately, however, this was notScotland but England, so we all had herring even though we were only women!After dinner in the evenings we used to do puzzles. There were two sorts.Ordinary jigsaws, where you had to piece a big picture together, or boxes withglass tops, inside which were silver bullets which had to be rolled into a hole.I really do not know which kind I disliked most, and it was considered anextraordinary thing that I did not seem content to spend evening after eveningdoing these puzzles. There was nothing about me that surprised everybody so muchas this. They would say, “But you haven’t tried this one at all, yet!” andproduce a puzzle that was exactly the same as the others except that the picturewas different, or that you used a little trowel instead of rolling the silverball about inside a box. They simply could not understand that I preferred toread a book or talk or anything rather than do those wretched puzzles. At theend of the evening there was a glass of hot milk for everyone, and I was alwaystaken to my room and seen almost into bed before I was left alone. I supposethey thought I should probably go out and break up the village if I were allowedto sit up alone. Well, perhaps they were right after all. There were times whenI felt I might do anything at any moment.How different this was from the simplicity I had imagined! There were nopeaceful days here, but instead an endless succession of potty little parties,always consisting of the same stupid and self-satisfied people. Every kind ofsnobbery, self-importance and hypocrisy seemed to go in the village, far morethan anything of the kind I had ever come across in London. I myself was notregarded as the interesting person I had expected to be, as someone who had beenthrough experiences they would never encounter, who had seen sides of life thatthey had only read of in novels—no, to them I was only Dick’s fiancée, who had,unfortunately, poor girl, not been properly brought up.They were, I suppose, kind to me and did their best for me according to theirlights. But when I remember the forbearance I continually showed the solemnbores whose conversation I listened to, and the remarks I did not make, I am ofthe opinion that I really was not so ungrateful as people may think.I even used to go to lectures on potatoes and that sort of thing to try and keepmyself occupied. Practically the only friend I had was the daughter of aneighbouring farmer, with whom I used to go out and drink any amount of cider.We used also to play practical jokes on the people living round, such as tyingstring across the drive at night in which they got entangled with theirbicycles. One rather unkind thing I did while I was in the country was a trick Iplayed on one of the eight sons of a neighbour. He was an ugly and conceitedyoung man who always used to go about saying that I was in love with him. Thisannoyed me very much, so I played up to him and got his photograph from him as apresent. I went into the town and had a lot of reproductions made with stickybacks, and came back and stuck them everywhere I could think of. I put them ongates and trees and on notice boards. In fact absolutely everywhere.I ran a stall at the Church Jumble Sale and Bazaar. It was hats, but no onebought any because they thought they were too gay for the country. I was verydisappointed, as I had taken great trouble with them. There were times, you willeasily understand, when I longed to return to my old Bohemian mode of life.London, seen from the country, seemed quite as attractive as the country hadseemed from London. I began to say to myself that the Café Royal, not a rectory,was my true home, and I yearned after my long exile to return to it. As timepassed I longed more and more for it. But yet I made no plans for escaping, andwhen I did escape it was done on impulse and without thinking about itbeforehand.As a matter of fact one of the things that really did more than anything else tosicken me with the country was the following episode. The farmer’s daughter Ihave mentioned above had a brother who was in love with me, and we often used togo for walks together. He would usually take his gun with him, as he was veryfond of shooting and an extremely good shot. One day, walking across a ploughedfield, he stumbled in one of the furrows and fell with his gun under him. Theshock of the fall made the gun go off and he was hit in the head. He was aterrible sight lying there covered in blood. I rushed off for help at once, butnothing could be done. This incident thoroughly shocked me. After that I neverwanted to go out at all. I hated everything round me. This seemed worse thanthings that happen in towns. There one is somehow prepared for tragedy, but herein the country it seemed more horrible than I can say. But still I could notbring myself to tell them definitely that I was going away. Besides which Inever had any money to speak of, which would have made getting away difficult,and, anyway, it could only be done after a great family scene. I was sent intothe town one day to buy some almanacs, together with a few more householdarticles, for which I was entrusted with a pound. As my bus drew up outside thestation I noticed the word “Paddington” on one of the coaches of a train thathad just pulled up at the far platform. I leapt off the bus, dashed to thebooking office, the sovereign in my hand.“I want a ticket to London,” I panted. “How much is it?”“All right,” replied the booking-clerk, “you’ve got plenty of time.”I flung down the pound and, without waiting for the change—although, as thebooking-clerk said, I had plenty of time—dashed over the bridge, and plumpedmyself, perspiring, into the nearest carriage.From Paddington I took a taxi to the Café Royal. The first person I saw therewas Dick.“What on earth are you doing here?” he asked.“Lend me some money for my taxi,” I replied.He gave me ten shillings. He was naturally very surprised by my suddenappearance, and he began to ask me every kind of question about how I had got toLondon again. On my return I explained to him over a drink, with great kindness,that the last three months had convinced me that I could never adapt myself tohis way of life, and, I added, since I had consented to marry Arthur the nightbefore it was arranged that I should go to the country, that it was to Arthurthat I now ought to go.Arthur was astonished and delighted when I informed him over the telephone of myreturn to London and my intention of coming to see him immediately.“I felt sure,” he boasted, after kissing me several times, and exclaiming,“Darling, this is wonderful,” between each kiss—“I knew somehow, deep down, thatyou would come back to me”—he kissed me again, playfully, and added, “some day,you little devil.”I made him sit in an easy chair and arranged myself on a cushion at his feet.Then I said, “You had that conviction because I intended you should have it. Ipossess that power, you know, over those I desire to hold.”He stroked my hair.It was arranged that we should be married in a week’s time.Preparations for the wedding took up most of the following week. This was allvery amusing for me. I love excitement always, and as this was the first time Iwas getting married I was more thrilled by it, I suppose, than I have been onlater occasions when it has happened. The ring was bought, the licence wasobtained, and I had a gorgeous time collecting my trousseau.Though I had been bred in poverty, I knew how to spend money, and Arthur wasvery liberal.We dined together every night in the most excellent restaurants. After thetheatre we would sup off champagne and caviare and oysters, and all the things Iadore. And the rest of the night till it was time to go home would be spentdancing.On the night preceding the eve of our wedding I had a whim to visit for the lasttime the Café Royal and my old Bohemian haunts. We accordingly invited some ofour friends to dinner in the Café Royal, and went on thence to the Crabtree. Atthe Crabtree we met Bunny. He had a girl with him, but did not appear to beenjoying himself. When he saw me he smiled. I went over to speak to him.“I’m going to be married the day after to-morrow,” I said.He said nothing, but looked as if he had received a shock.“You might at least congratulate me.”“Who to?” he at length asked.“My fiancé,” I replied, “is over there. Come with me and meet him.”He came, leaving the girl where she was. I made him sit next to me, with Arthuron the other side, and gave him, in answer to his inquiries, an account of mystay in the country.After a while Bunny insisted that I should go with him to the Palm Court, a clubwhich had just opened on the other side of the street. There he confessed thathe could not bear the idea of my marrying anyone else but himself. He said thathe loved me and that he knew that I loved him too. He brushed aside all that hadhappened in the country, and promised me that if I did marry him he would makeno effort to change the kind of life which I was used to living.I felt myself weakening. I knew that much of what he said was true, but I couldnot make up my mind what I ought to do about it.“But,” I objected, “it’s too late; all the arrangements have been made, andbesides, you couldn’t get a licence in time.”“No, it isn’t,” he replied, “I can get a licence in twenty-four hours.”I suggested that we should dance.I was the first to remember that our long absence together would give rise tocomment, if not anxiety.Arthur, at any rate, was clearly annoyed, and he said rather angrily to me on myreturn, “So you have come back. Miss —— and I had almost arranged to console oneanother.”“It was touch and go,” I replied.But it was more than “touch and go.” The thing had happened. I felt myself oncemore wildly in love with Bunny, and all he had said and what he obviously feltmade it impossible for me at that moment to marry anyone else. Perhaps if therehad been delay it would not have happened. But there were no difficulties.Everything seemed to be made easy for us.So my white wedding dress, veil, stockings, flowers, were all carefully laidout, my going-away clothes were packed in a suit-case. I thought that for once Ihad left nothing to luck. But when I came to dress I could not find my whiteshoes anywhere, and after frenziedly going through the contents of the suit-caseseveral times, and searching the bedroom diligently, I came to the conclusionthat they must already be at King’s Cross in one of our trunks. I cannotunderstand how I came to overlook them. I had remembered everything else down tothe last detail.There was nothing else for it but to borrow a pair, and the smallest I could get(I take size one) were fives.When we arrived at the Marylebone Registry Office, my agitation made me carelessin arranging my huge footwear, and in full view of the official, the bridegroom,the best man, and the few assembled guests and spectators, I lost both my shoeswhile descending from the taxi. It was a most ridiculous thing to happen, but ina way rather suitable to this strange wedding.So unnerved was I by this mishap that I could think of nothing else all throughthe ceremony, and it was only when Bunny and I were actually seated in the taxi,taking us to the wedding breakfast at the Café Royal, that I realized to-day wasthe very day on which I was to have married Arthur. I suppose everyone willagree that I had behaved disgracefully."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VDRUGS AND DIVORCEMy honeymoon—Cocaine—Scotland—A curious household in London—The outbreak ofwar—Bunny joins the army—I am left alone in London—Chinese hair-nets—Divorce—Achivalrous Australian—A thrashing—Back to the Café again—I sit to Epstein for“The Savage.”I LEARNT one new thing on my honeymoon—to take drugs. It appeared that myhusband was a cocaine sniffer of long standing, and being a student at one ofthe largest London hospitals was able to get unlimited supplies of the purestuff. As you probably know, drug takers have a passion for making disciples.Bunny lost no time in introducing me to the habit. In the taxi taking us toKing’s Cross I noticed my husband take a pinch of something from a beautifulinlaid snuff-box that he always carried about with him. I asked what it waslike. He told me the effect was marvellous.“Is it ordinary snuff?” I asked.“Try some,” he answered, offering me the box.I gingerly sniffed a little and felt nothing. We continued the journey withoutsaying more about it. That evening, however, just before dinner I thought Bunnylooked depressed. I asked him if he had a headache. Instead of replying he tooka big pinch from his snuff box and sniffed it eagerly. At once he becamecheerful and animated. This struck me as being very odd indeed. I determined toexperiment further. More courageous this time, I took a larger pinch, andsniffed still rather suspiciously but with more conviction. He had notexaggerated, for a feeling of joy came over me and my mind worked withextraordinary activity, in a way that I had never experienced before. I feltentirely different. I seemed in better health, to have more energy, to be moreamusing, in fact everything that one would wish to feel like when you wanted tobe absolutely at your best.Compared with cocaine, all other pleasures seemed flat. As soon as we got toOban we took a room at one of the best hotels and set out to dope ourselves. Atfirst it was wonderful. I shall never forget the incredible deliriums ofpleasure and excitement which I got first of all when I began taking drugs. Butlater we lost all except the one persistent and tyrannical desire for cocaine,kept to it, if that were necessary, by fear of the awful reaction that wouldfollow if the supply were cut off. We ordered no food and gave no sign that wewere alive. This naturally aroused the suspicions of the hotel authorities, who,after some days—I have no idea how many—forcibly entered our room, and threw usout.From Oban we went to Birmingham, and from Birmingham back to London, where, forthe next six months, we were members of the extraordinary household presidedover by Stewart Gray.Stewart, I have already informed the reader, was the originator of the“Back-to-the-Land” movement. His ruling passion, which involved him in anynumber of scrapes and complications, was an enthusiasm for the simple life. Inorder to keep to this ideal he wore a beard which concealed the absence of acollar, and, though the conditions of town life made boots a necessity, heescaped utter perfidy by dispensing with socks and bootlaces. His house, wherewe went to live, was a biggish one, situated in Ormond Terrace. It contained nofurniture beyond the appliances necessary to the simplest existence. Even thebath had the water permanently cut off owing to Stewart’s high-minded refusal topay rates.image [images/f097-01.jpg][Basil.BETTY MAY [06_illustrations.xhtml#fig_05]The other people who had rooms in the house were mainly homeless artists andmodels, who came and went more or less as it suited them. They were an oddcollection. Some of them have since those days made names for themselves andhave perhaps almost forgotten about what it was like then. Most of them wereabsolutely without any money as a rule. The only fixture besides Stewart himselfwas an Indian doctor, who made up very good restoratives for anyone who happenedto be feeling the effects of a thick night.The colony was divided into households, but the habit of borrowing resulted insomething like what communism ought to be. The drugs, however, which I was stilltaking heavily, were hidden by us, and one pretty model who was staying thereused, I remember, to hide her dresses under the bed. I remember I used to cook acertain well-known artist’s breakfast there every morning, for which I was paidsixpence a time.Stewart alone was inflexible. Even in prison, where his notions of simplefinance frequently landed him, he did not weaken, and starved rather than panderto the social system he disapproved of by partaking of the comparatively simplediet provided for prisoners.The life of this little colony was broken up by the war. Not, however, beforeone of its mainstays, the Indian doctor, left us as a consequence of having madehis dinner off a couple of poisoned kippers stolen from Lilian Shelley.Bunny, unlike others, joined the army at once, and was sent to Bisley fortraining. I followed him there and took a farm house about three miles from thecamp, where we used to entertain the officers in the wildest style. Most of themwere bachelors, so they were glad to come over and have parties at our house,where they could get good food and comfort. Something different to just sittingin the mess.I amazed everyone by my personality and behaviour. At first some of the morestodgy did not know what to make of me, and were accordingly stand-offish orpositively disagreeable. But by the time Bunny left for France in December I wasthe darling of the entire camp.After Bunny’s departure I went to the flat he had taken for me in Richmond, andsettled down to wait patiently till he came back. For ages I was occupied withsorrow and anxiety, and then as these faded, I grew bored. Richmond is a niceplace, but it is a long way from the Café Royal. Really there was nothing to dothere at all.Life quickly fell into the old routine I was used to. A good many members of ourcircle remained at home, either because they were unfit, or because theydisapproved of fighting, and there was always a supply of officers on leave,anxious to have forty-eight hours of fun, and with plenty of money in theirpockets. The return of one of our friends was always celebrated by a granddinner at the Eiffel Tower or some other well-known restaurant, followed by anall-night party.I took a job in a hairdresser’s and tobacconist’s shop in the Buckingham PalaceRoad. I felt that I ought to do some work that would release a man for the army.My duties consisted of serving behind the counter, selling cigarettes, matches,pipe-cleaners, brushes, combs, hair-nets, etc., and in taking the money forshaves and haircuts. I entered into my new business with enthusiasm, but I feelnow that I was not very capable about money—I always asked the customers howmuch I ought to take and what change they were entitled to, which would havestood in the way of my making a success of trade. As a matter of fact, I am sureit worked, in one way, and I was never cheated. People were usually so amusedwhen they were asked to do this that they would take great trouble to explain alot of arithmetic to me, none of which, I am afraid, I ever listened to. I donot much regret that my career in that line was brought to an end in thefollowing rather absurd manner.One day I was getting down a box of hair-nets, when I noticed a label statingthat they were manufactured in China. The evening before I had read in the paperthat a certain woman had been found suffering from leprosy which she had caughtfrom . . . a Chinese hair-net. I rushed to a mirror . . . had I? . . . Yes,there were three white spots on my forehead. Hatless, in my white overall, I ranout of the shop and got on a bus which happened to be going to Piccadilly (Ican’t say why I got on to a bus). Never before or since have I experienced thesame despair. I warned the other occupants of the bus to keep away from me andrefused to let the conductor touch my money for fear of infecting them with mydisease. I need hardly tell you that everybody was very surprised and frightenedand thought I was mad.At Piccadilly Circus I jumped from the bus and went to say farewell to myfriends and the Café Royal. I announced that I had got leprosy.“Have a double brandy,” someone suggested, but I refused at first. I was amazedthat nobody seemed to be in the least afraid of catching this dreadful diseasefrom me. Everyone took it quite calmly.“Promise you will smash the glass afterwards,” I then demanded. “Leprosy isterribly catching.” People actually laughed when I said this. I still could notmake out why I was not taken seriously.They agreed to smash the glass, and I drank the brandy down at a gulp. I hadanother and began to have a small hope that none of the nets I had handled wereleprous. There was a chance. I had a third brandy. A distinct chance. But Inever went back to the hairdresser’s shop.One night shortly after this it came to me that I must see Bunny again. Leavewas rather difficult to obtain just then, but I told Carlo to wire to him thathe must come home at once.I had heard nothing from him. And then suddenly he turned up at the Café Royal,fuming. “What the Hell did you mean by that wire?” he demanded, in a tone I willnot tolerate from anyone.I suppose he had some right to be annoyed and I ought not to have behaved as Idid. Anyway, that is neither here nor there. This, at any rate, is whathappened.“I just thought I’d like to see you,” I replied carelessly.“And may I ask where you’ve been ?”I told him of some of my escapades.“All right, then,” he said. “I shall instruct my solicitor to start divorceproceedings at once.”“Do,” I retorted, leaving him. “If you want to do that I will provide you plentyof evidence.”I must confess that during the war I suppose I did not behave myself very well.It was such a hectic time when everybody was trying to crowd what might be thelast human pleasure they would ever know into a few hours’ leave and no one knewfrom one day to the next how long they would live. You were rushing about thewhole time, and everybody seemed to have money to spend in a way they had neverdone before. I threw myself into this rather wild gaiety with all the violenceof which my very violent nature is capable, and if people blame me for it theyshould remember that I was not the only one who did so. Besides which the warwould have been even more awful than it was if the men on leave had not beenable to get a little fun out of life. In a way it all seems a rather confusedmemory to me. I was always reading in the papers or hearing from other people ofthe deaths of old friends. It was awful—it seemed sometimes as if everyone onehad ever known would be killed. And yet all the time other people wereappearing, and one went on dancing and rioting in an effort to forget howdreadful it all was.To subdue any heartache on Bunny’s account I took to doping and drinking moreheavily than ever. Already before the war, Bunny and I had been admitted to thecircle which included Billie Carleton and Ada Song Ping You, an English girlmarried to a Chinese, who, the magistrate declared, “acted as the high priestessat these unholy rites,” when sentencing her to five months’ imprisonment. Therewas one woman who had a very well furnished flat just off Edgware Road, whereshe used to give dope parties. All forms of drug-taking used to be indulged in.When I first went there it was opium. There was a lovely girl among the partywhom Bunny and I saw home at three o’clock in the afternoon after a party thathad lasted from ten o’clock on the previous night. We said good-bye to her whenwe reached her flat. The next day we read that her body had been fished out ofthe river near London Bridge.About this time I met Mrs. Ping You, whom I mentioned above. She was one of theprettiest and most charming women I have ever met. She lived near Russell Squareand had a dear little daughter of about nine years old. This was before shemarried her Chinese husband. After she married him she went down to Chinatown tolive, away in the East End. Ping You had been an opium smoker since the age ofeleven and it was from him that Ada learned her knowledge of opium and itsmethods of cooking.It was at one of these parties that Billie Carleton turned up. She came straightfrom the theatre in which she had been appearing, and before long she was in themost sketchy of undergarments and stretched on the piles of cushions, smoking.The last time I saw Ada Ping You was when she came into the Café Royal in whatwas more or less Oriental dress. I had not seen her for some time, and went overto where she was sitting. I noticed that all her finger-nails were more than aninch long.“Why don’t you cut your nails?” I said, without thinking much about it.She drew herself up.“How dare you!” she said. “It is the fashion in our country.”You can see by this how thoroughly she had given herself over to the ways of theEast.Even then I had been taking about one hundred grains—ten is a fatal dose to anunaccustomed person —of cocaine per day, varied occasionally with injections ofmorphia, and my mind and body had already suffered the inevitable effects. I wasa victim to morbid suspicious mania, and frequently tried to commit suicide onthe most absurd grounds. Once in a West End restaurant the waiter brought mewhite coffee instead of black. Immediately I concluded that the whole world wasagainst me, that not only my friends but even my favourite waiter had enteredinto a conspiracy to prevent my drinking black coffee. In a frightful paroxysmof despair I drew a hat pin and was only prevented from an attempt on my ownlife by the prompt intervention of my right-hand neighbour. This shows you thesort of state I was in. I might easily have decided to kill myself on someoccasion when there was no one there to prevent me from doing so. As it happenedI escaped this danger. Another terrible fear I felt was that the buildings underwhich I passed would fall in upon me, and again, when on waking up after an orgyI could hardly open my mouth, I was convinced that I had got lockjaw. PhysicallyI was in an equally bad state. Severe headaches and that maddening itch of theskin known as the cocaine bug were chronic afflictions whenever I was not underthe influence of drugs. On one occasion I nearly died. Walking with my husbandand a friend down Lisle Street one night, I fell suddenly to the ground as rigidas death. I lay there without moving. I was not totally unconscious, and Iremember thinking to myself how amusing it would be if this were really death. Icould see the anxious face of my husband bending over me, and I heard his friendsay, “She’s gone.”I tried to smile. It was so funny. But my face muscles were set and would notrespond. Luckily we were near a chemist, from whom my husband obtained some amylnitrite. He broke the tube of amyl nitrite into a handkerchief, which he heldover my mouth and nose. Asphyxia had already set in, but the stuff brought theblood rushing to my head, and in a few minutes I was revived. But it had been anear thing.I cannot describe to you what an awful bondage this craving for drugs was. Onecould never think of anything else. I am not going to be hypocritical about it.Now that I have come out to the other side I am glad to have had the experience.I remember the excitements I got out of all and must admit that I enjoyed them.On the other hand, I must also admit that what one went through did not makethem. worth while. I love feeling free more than anything else in the world, andwhen one is taking drugs seriously one never does feel free. Often I lost myvoice entirely. Sometimes I felt so desperate that I used to tear all my clothesto pieces in front of my husband, who was terrified of me when I was in one ofmy rages. I used to run away, and Bunny would have to make inquiries in theneighbourhood for “a girl who snaps her fingers at everybody.”There is a picture by B. N. Satterthwaite, an old friend of mine, reproduced inthis book which shows me in one of my angry moods. I think it has caughtsomething of me when I am about to be violent, and for that reason I mention itnow to draw your attention to it.By the time of my breach with Bunny I had progressed to one hundred and fiftygrains—that is about half a gram a day, and I don’t remember how much atnight—and the severity of the after-effects had increased in proportion. I wasin a bad way. Indeed, if I had not chanced to meet a burly and chivalrousAustralian, I should certainly not be writing this book. He was absolutelyresponsible for saving my life, and I shall always feel grateful to him forthis, if there were no other reasons why I should keep him in my memory.image [images/f107-01.jpg]BETTY MAY. BY B. N. SATTERTHWAITE [06_illustrations.xhtml#fig_06]He was a major in the Australian army, and looked very fine in his uniform. Hisname was Roy.“Look here, kid,” he remarked the first evening we met, in the direct, masterfulway he always spoke in, “you’ve got to cut the drink and the dope right out fromthis evening. And what’s more, you’re going to marry me, so I can see that youdo.”This was too good. He had the bronzed complexion, the clear blue eyes accustomedto focusing distant objects, the firm jaw, the gentle voice with a hint ofsuppressed power in it. In fact, a lot of very attractive qualities. Also he wasa hypnotist.“When’s the wedding?” I inquired, ‘calling his bluff,’ as he would have phrasedit.“You leave that to me.”Well, I had no objection to playing a hand with him. I accepted his invitationto meet him next day for lunch at the Monico, only stipulating that, formodesty’s sake, my friend Bobby Charming should accompany me. He approved.The party took place as arranged, and we talked lightly about our approachingmarriage. Before we parted I mentioned that in a certain shop was a pair ofbeautiful top boots which I had long desired to have. I did not think any moreabout this stray remark of mine.The next day, to my surprise, a parcel arrived at my address containing theboots and a note which said: “You will lunch with me at the Café Royal to-day atone o’clock.”If he could bluff, so could I. I went round to the Café at about half-pasttwelve and invited all the friends I could find to meet my fiancé at lunch. Bythe time Roy arrived I had about twenty-five of us assembled drinking cocktails.I introduced Roy to them and explained that 1 had taken the liberty of invitingsome friends to lunch with us in honour of our betrothal. The lunch was worthyof the occasion. I ordered all the most expensive dishes on the menu, andchampagne. As each course was brought I watched Roy to see if he had had enough,but he never flinched, and paid the bill at the end—goodness knows what itamounted to—like a gentleman.Baffled again, I was determined to show him that I should be too great anuisance to make it worth his while to run after me, and so when he asked mewhat I was going to do that afternoon I replied that as I was going to bemarried shortly I ought to go and buy some suitable clothes.“All right,” he said, “I’ll come with you.”It was a shopping expedition. I recklessly ordered garment after garment, eachcostlier than the last, until I had let him in for at least two hundred pounds.Still he gave no sign of quitting, and asked with only a faintly ironical smileif I was quite sure I had got all I wanted. His composure provoked me.“Not quite,” I said, and indicated to the assistant a coat made of the mostaggressively striped material I have ever seen.“You can’t wear that,” exclaimed this man of stone, showing agitation for thefirst time.“You watch,” I triumphantly replied, walking out into the street in it. But thiswas the only and very slight triumph I had over him. It was he who defeated meall the way through.He had to return to Aldershot that night—he was a major in the R.A.M.C.—butbefore going he established me in a furnished flat in Earl’s Court, the rentpaid three months in advance, where, he said, I could live till we were able toget married. Here I remained for ten days, awaiting his next move, theconviction gradually becoming stronger that he had at last had enough.Then one day Roy arrived with a day’s leave and a special licence.I told him that I was already married, and that as I had no intention of goingto gaol for bigamy the joke had better stop. It had been good fun while itlasted. I thanked him for the good time he had given me, and hoped I should seehim again some time at the Café Royal, where I was nearly always to be found. Itook a step towards the door.“Wait a minute, kid,” he said; “not so fast. If you’re married you’ll have toget a divorce—with me as corespondent.”I had lost. As it happened the divorce was not necessary.Poor Bunny’s death in France did away with the need for waiting till the divorcehad gone through, and within a short time I was married to Roy at the HenriettaStreet registry office, where so many romantic weddings have taken place. Afterthe ceremony we celebrated at Simpson’s in the Strand.I took up my abode permanently in the flat in Fawcett Street, where my husbandvisited me whenever he could get leave, and I promised to give up taking drugsor spirits during his absence.I did not keep this promise. I could not. I used to come across old friends ofmine with whom I had gone to dope parties, and gradually the temptation to enjoythe excitement of drugs and the fact that I was lonely became too much for meand I began to take to drugs again. Roy returned one day to find me recoveringfrom a dope party, which had lasted three days and three nights. He took off hisSam Browne belt and gave me the severest beating with it I have ever had, whicharoused me from the coma into which I had fallen. It was dreadful. I shuddereven now when I think of it, but it had the right effect. It cured me. When itwas over he carried me to bed, and there I lay between life and death for threeweeks.Roy’s intervention was my farewell to drug-taking. For three weeks I was sodangerously ill that Roy was granted special leave to look after me. All thattime I had to be in a darkened room. Both light and noise were indescribablypainful to me. A door opening downstairs sounded like an explosion.When I was sufficiently recovered to travel, Roy took me down to Hastings, wherehe was stationed at the time. Here, by strictly limiting and progressivelyreducing my allowance of cocaine, he eventually assisted me to overcome mycraving for it. It took a certain time to do, and there were moments when I feltthat I should never be able to give it up, but in time I gradually began to feelmore and more able to live without it, and as I was extremely happy with Roy theneed for it at last disappeared. I felt that I was free once more.About two months after my removal from London Roy was transferred to France, andI was left once more alone. For the next two years he, was only able to visit meoccasionally, and for very short periods, but, so grateful was I for what he haddone for me, and so profound was my respect for his character, that during thewhole of that time I never reverted to drug-taking, and remained faithfully inHastings without paying a single visit to London or the Café Royal.For no other man I have ever known could I have done as much. Before and sincebeing under Roy’s influence I have obeyed no one. Not to disappoint him was thesole and precious ambition of my life, until . . .There was no need for me to have found them. I was led to them by Fate. Oncemore I was on the edge of a permanent security. Once more my fate contrived toturn me back. And by a devilish trick, I shall never forget the shock and theanguish of discovering his infidelity—that he of all people should have beendeceiving me.He wrote asking me to send out some gear he had left behind on his last leave,and rummaging among our trunks I came across a bundle of love-letters, tied upneatly with pink ribbon, from a French girl.We were divorced.It was in this way then that I found myself back in my old haunts. I was morefit to face the world now, cured as I was of my drug-taking, and by this time Ihad seen enough of life to feel pretty confident in my powers of looking aftermyself.“I thought you were dead,” exclaimed the waiter who brought me the first brandyand soda I had tasted for two years.And indeed I was welcomed back to the Café Royal like one returned from thedead. My old friend, Judah, the manager, the head waiter, and all his staffcrowded round me to hear what I had been doing. Parties were given in my honour.London held out its arms to greet me.And I—was myself again. People I knew and utter strangers accumulated round mytable until half the café was talking to me. More and more drinks were ordered.We revelled as though it were our last night on earth. And with every freshround the toast was always “Betty.”It was some time after these events that another important incident in my lifeoccurred. After describing so many rather dreadful things that have happened tome at one time or another I think I should now tell you something whichcontrasts very strongly with the adventurous side of my life. It is one of mymost pleasant recollections and always will be. After all I had been through itcame as a wonderful relief.Ever since Epstein had first spoken to me ages before at the Café Royal we hadmet on and off and he and his wife had always been very kind to me. I alwayswanted to sit for him, but he always regarded me as a sort of child and did notthink me sufficiently developed and interesting to be a suitable model for him.Then one day I met his wife, Peggy, who seems to me to be an absolutely perfectwife for a great sculptor, and she asked me to come round to tea with them thenext day at their house in Guilford Street. After tea, to my intense delight,Epstein suddenly said in his deep, mellow voice, “Betty, I think the time hascome for you to sit for me.” I was delighted. It was in a way such a surprise,though at the same time I had always had a very strong feeling that one of thesedays I should sit for him. So every day I used to arrive at his studio at nineo’clock, and often did not leave until seven or eight, while he worked on thebust that was later to be known to the world as “The Savage.” There wassomething so restful and peaceful about sitting for Epstein after all thegoings-on I have described that it was really like a tonic for me. First of allI felt horribly nervous. Epstein made me pose, and then began making varioussuggestions and alterations, and gazed at me from various distances from beneathhis figures. Gradually I became less nervous, and Epstein suddenly said, “Holdthat pose for a moment.”I should like to mention that although the bust, when it was shown at theLeicester Galleries, was called “The Savage,” to Epstein himself, like all hisother work, it was known merely by the name of its model. To him it was simply“Betty.” This is a matter of great pride to me. Epstein also did another head ofme which endless people have told me looks like the head of Beethoven.Epstein would stand moulding the clay into shape, and sometimes he would say,“Sing something, Betty. Sing one of your songs,” and I would sing “Sigh no more,ladies,” or “The Raggle-Taggle Gipsies,” or “Bonnie Earl o’ Murray,” andsometimes Epstein would join in with his great deep voice. On other occasions hewould remain silent all through the day, thinking only of his work.After work he would sometimes take me out to dinner with Peggy. We sometimeswent to the Isola Bella in Soho, where he made me taste his famous egg-flip, amost wonderful concoction, which he is very fond of. It was at times such asthese that I got to know what a magnificent woman Mrs. Epstein is, and how sheunderstands looking after an artist. She never allows him to be disturbed whenhe is working. She smooths out everything and the whole household runs on oiledwheels. She knows just when to have a meal ready and when not to bother about itif her husband wants to go on working. What a pity every man of genius cannothave such a wife."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VITHE MYSTICRaoul—The Princess Amen Ra—Marriage again—The spirit photograph—My walk to “TheTrout”—An apparition—I meet the Mystic—The White Magician—The Mystic at theHarlequin—I visit the Mystic’s house—Raoul decides to go to Sicily.IT was soon after this that I met Raoul and we began to go out a lot together.At the time I am thinking of it was past midnight and pouring with heavy, warmrain, as if it were coming down from a shower-bath.Raoul and I were both in evening dress, without wraps or protection of any kind.We had been dancing at the Harlequin Club, and he had had one of his suddenimpulses to go out as we were for a walk in the rain. It was the sort of madthing he loved doing.“It’s the most glorious sensation in the world,” he said to me. He was veryclever, and had rather a deep voice and always talked in short, excited bursts.His age was twenty-three, but his complexion was that of a boy of fifteen.We walked round and round Golden Square.“The great thing is to abandon yourself,” .he explained carefully and seriously.“Revel in wetness.” His collar and shirt were by now a slimy pulp. “My collarfeels as if it were made of soft velvet. But if I had on a mackintosh every dropthat penetrated to my linen would positively sear my soul. It’s just a matter ofacceptance.” Then he branched off on a long description of how he spent a nightnaked on a moor, in the rain.I did not listen very closely. I was thinking how extraordinary this all was.The war was over at last and life seemed to have become less hectic and muddled.By this time I was quite well known, and yet here I was on the point of gettingmarried again with little prospect of it being more of a success than it hadbeen in the past.Who was this impulsive, clear-eyed boy ? Why was I walking with him ? The sane,sensible explanation was that he had fallen in love with me, and we were shortlyto be married. . . . Quite simple.I had often been told about him by friends of mine from Oxford, where he wasregarded as something of a hero because of his roof-climbing and otherescapades. I had always heard that he was a great woman-hater and that womenbored him so much that he would hardly speak to them even if introduced. Inthis, at least, he was different to most other admirers I have had, most of whomhave held quite different views on this subject. The first time I saw him was inthe Harlequin. He jerked back his long fair hair when we were introduced andasked in his very man-of-the-world voice, “May I sit down?” I made room for him.“So you are a woman-hater?” I said.“All Antony’s love for Cleopatra,” he quite seriously replied, “was nothing tomy love for you.”That was typical of Raoul, toppling from reality into unreality. He made noanswer to my bantering retort, except to whisper tensely, “Can I see you afterdinner? “That evening we walked round and round Golden Square as we were doingnow, and had done many times since, and he recited poetry to me eagerly withoutthe slightest embarrassment. I was like Francis Thompson’s snowflake, he said.But I wondered. There was something of Bunny in Raoul, the same recklessness,the same topsyturvy sense of proportion. How often had the same thing happened!Roy had left me behind with the same result, and now once more. I thought ofPretty Pet and of White Panther, and my apache days, but, dramatic as they hadbeen, I had never felt so bewildered as now.“I shall kill myself,” Raoul had said—and meant it —“and I shall kill you too,if you won’t marry me.”“But you must tell your mother about me,” I insisted, for he was such a kidreally. And so I was solemnly taken to see his mother. It was all fixed up thatwe should get married.The mad dream was materializing—in fact had materialized even to the extent ofthe engagement ring I was wearing. The ring was made in the shape of a curledsnake with tiny rubies for eyes. It had, I believe, some symbolic meaning andwas taken from an Egyptian model. Raoul was a keen Egyptologist, and in thisfavourite study his nature showed itself more conspicuously than anywhere else.A talented scholar— he took a first in history at Oxford, though no one had everseen him work—he took an expert and scientific pleasure in papyri, inscriptions,etc. But at the same time he had a belief in the occult. He asked me one day toaccompany him to the British Museum to see the mummy of the Princess Amen Ra. Iconsented, and on the way he told me legends of how she had brought death ordisaster to all who had, however unwittingly, offended her. “So you must be verycareful,” he playfully warned me. I protested my ignorance of Egyptianetiquette, but promised to do my best.I always find mummies rather disappointing. They are impossible to reallybelieve in. I cannot manage to have the proper feelings in their presence. Amummy affects me far less than, say, an old photograph.“Well,” I said to Raoul, “is this the touchy old lady?”He nodded, then, like the child who reads the Lord’s Prayer through backwardsjust to see if the devil will really appear, I put out my tongue at the PrincessAmen Ra. If I had guessed the effect that this piece of silliness would have onRaoul I should never have done it. It never crossed my mind that he really tookall these things as seriously as he used to say he did. I thought it was allpart of his strange way of talking.“There now,” I said to Raoul, “if I get run over by a bus you’ll know who to—”Raoul’s face prevented me from finishing my sentence. He was pale and showedevery sign of the most intense fear.“Good God!” he gasped. It was no sham. Without a word he rushed me out of theMuseum, took me straight back to where I was staying and told me to wait for himthere.“But where are you going?” I asked.“Back to the Museum,” he answered, still pale, “to pray that she may take herevil spell from you and place it on me.”I saw that he was not joking and that he meant every word of what he said, and Irealized that I had really shocked him. This showed me that I must be morecareful in the future, but it did not warn me where this belief in the occultwould eventually lead both of us. He had taken my doom on himself. He, this boywalking beside me in the rain in his pulpy shirt, and relating how one nightreturning drunk from the Hypocrites’ Club in Oxford he had pushed a policeman’shelmet over his eyes—describing how a certain “aesthete” had kept a gang of“hearties” at bay with an umbrella—and telling how a friend of his had been sentdown for going away for a weekend with a woman—yet even now he was going underthe shadow of a vengeance from ancient Egypt.We were married, in Oxford, shortly before the end of the summer term. Onceagain I stood in front of the registrar—this time, however, in my own shoes.Raoul, less experienced than I, was extremely nervous, and at the crisis of theceremony dropped the ring, which rolled into a corner of the room. One of thewitnesses crawled after it and stood dusting his trousers for the rest of thetime. Raoul’s hand trembled as he slipped the ring on to my finger at the secondattempt. I left the office feeling slightly uneasy. Had the dropping of the ringanything to do with the Princess Amen Ra ? I knew it was an evil omen. Was mymarriage again going to be a failure?On the day of our marriage a thing happened which, although even at the time itfilled me with a certain foreboding, I never imagined would return to me in suchcircumstances of horror. We were walking through the gardens of St. John’s andsomeone suggested taking a photograph of us both. We stood beneath one of thetrees there and he took a snap. When this photograph was printed there was theghostly form of a slim young man lying just over my husband’s head. It was asthough the form was asleep or dead, and the arms were raised slightly behind thehead, while the head drooped gently to one side. At the time I remember we wereamused by this “spook” photograph, but I felt an indescribable feeling ofanxiety, even though I laughed at it. Later on in my story you will learn how myfears were justified and how amazing a warning this was of what was to come.That evening a party of us went to one of the dance halls forbidden toundergraduates. It was rather a sordid place, with a bad floor and a worse band,whose chief allurement must have been the fact that it was forbidden. Ratherdrunken undergraduates were dancing with cheap-scented girls of the town. Someof them greeted Raoul noisily. However, he was not in the slightest degreeembarrassed, and treated them with his usual easy insolence of manner.We stayed there a bit. It was not very amusing, but there did not seem to beanything else to do in Oxford at this time of night. I was dancing with Raoul, Iremember, when at about eleven o’clock the alarm went round that the proctorswere coming. There was a rush for the door, and I was left alone. Twoundergraduates only had not fled, and they were hiding under a seat in theladies’ cloak-room, protected by the skirts of their partners. The proctors,well up to the trick, and untroubled by modesty, searched that apartment as amatter of course. It was an exciting moment. They were just going when one ofthe idiotic girls laughed, and the proctors returned and dragged the fugitivesignominiously by the ankles from their concealment.At last the proctors went away and some of our party returned, but Raoul was notamong them.I was very sick with myself for having suggested coming to the dance. Raoul,with whom I was quite unjustly angry for leaving me, had been against it,because, having got leave to go away for the week-end so as to be able to staywith me on our wedding night, it would have been fatal for him to be discoveredin Oxford.By now the place was closing down. What was I to do ? Would Raoul come back forme, or would he expect me to follow him? I was undecided until my hesitation wasovercome for me by a certain famous boxer, who had been with us, and now offeredto take me back to the hotel where Raoul and I were staying.I then gave way to one of those strange impulses that I get at times to dosomething quite unexpected. On this occasion it was nothing very dreadful, butit ended rather unpleasantly and uncomfortably for myself.I was just about to ring the night bell when I thought it would be fun to walkout to the Trout Inn and see the river and the water meadows by moonlight. I wasalso not reluctant to punish Raoul for abandoning me at the dance hall.The scenery around the old Trout Inn was delightful. For a long time I leanedover the bridge looking down into the water, half hypnotized. My soul lived inthe water for a time. The water twisted and swirled. I thought of the time inthe Café Royal when I had wanted to drown myself, and imagined my own hairrippling like smoke on a still day. And then I imagined that as I lay at thebottom of the river Raoul kissed me, but Raoul remained at the bottom of theriver in my place. But who was Raoul? I could not remember.At last my soul returned to me, and the river and I were ourselves again. Ilooked out over the flats dotted with trees and I felt a desire to explore. So Icrossed the bridge and walked along the bank of the river that was to guide meinto the enchanted country. I walked, it seemed, for miles, hatless, and I sangsongs, but not aloud. The river bank was unfortunately both sloping andslippery, and I fell right in, head first.It was very wet and very cold. I was furious with myself for having done such asilly thing. I splashed about for a bit, thinking I was going to be drowned, butit turned out to be fairly shallow, which was lucky.I dragged myself out with some difficulty, getting very muddy in the process,and returned by the same way as I had come, but in a different mood. Unconsciousof everything except my own discomforts, with no imaginations more exciting thanof pneumonia or a cold in the head, I slowly trailed back to the hotel, and thuspresented myself, a bride, to my third husband.For a moment Raoul could not recognize the miry apparition that met his eyes.Water dripped from me as I stood there. He asked me what on earth had happenedand how I had managed to get like this. Had someone thrown me into the river?“I thought I’d go for a walk,” I explained, “and I fell into the river.”“Good God,” he asked, “is this what I’ve got to get used to?”I was not going to be reprimanded at this early stage of our relationship, so Isaid, “And why did you leave me at the dance hall to find my way home alone ?”“The proctors——”“I suppose you care more about the proctors than about me.”But it was not really a very serious sort of quarrel!However, it was not only Raoul who had to accustom himself to the new andsurprising.I have referred already to the superstitious side of his character as shown inthe matter of the Princess Amen Ra. The following day I was to have moreevidence of it, and to be involved to a certain extent myself. A great friend ofhis, he told me, whom he was very anxious that I should meet, was coming todinner.I did not know the name he mentioned and was not prepared for the ratherstriking-looking individual who turned up at dinner time.He was tall and gaunt, with unblinking, almost lidless, eyes, like those of acat. For some reason or other I felt an immediate repulsion for him. When heheld out his hand I pretended not to notice it. I would rather have touched adead rat or a toad’s belly.He turned out, nevertheless, to be an excellent talker, and I was entertained aswell as revolted by him. I got to know him better later on and discovered thathe was really a very charming man. But even after I had got to like him I alwaysfelt that there was something uncanny about him I am very quick to sense thissort of thing by instinct. The conversation turned to poetry, about which Raoulwas enthusiastic—he wrote poetry himself, which was published in variousperiodicals and in “Oxford Poetry.” He was vigorously defending the poetry of, Ithink it was, Dowson and Lionel Johnson, which his friend had said wassentimental and decadent.“You’re just afraid to admire it,” he declared angrily. “You know that nowadaysone has to be nice-mannered and impersonal, and you don’t want to appearunfashionable. I hate the Georgians. I’m a romantic.”“Is there any living poet you admire?”Raoul mentioned a certain professor and poet of the occult. I had met him oncein 1914, at the Café Royal.“What’s he doing now?” the other asked.“Haven’t you heard?”“No.”“He’s started an Abbey in Sicily.”“Oh, yes.”The subject was dropped.After a pause, during which he stared at me with embarrassing concentration, thecat-eyed man asked Raoul in a theatrically abstracted, far-away voice, “I wonderwhat she was in her last incarnation?”Raoul got up and went into the bedroom. The guest and I uneasily conversed untilhe returned and solemnly announced,“I know what she was.”Our guest told him not to say at once. He then asked for some paper and a penciland said that he would write down what he thought before he heard what Raoul hadto say, and then the two theories could be compared. This was done, and he wrotefor some minutes. Then he turned to Raoul and asked him what conclusions he hadcome to as to what I had been.Raoul said that I had been a witch-doctor in some Eastern country where he hadbeen chieftain of the village. He had loved me, but because of the power Iwielded I had refused to give myself to him, and he had decided to kill me. Hehad therefore set me adrift in an open boat, which was capsized in a storm, andI had died of suffocation from drowning.This story accorded so well with my queer preoccupation with death by water thatmy heart gave a jump on hearing it. I had been drowned, else how could I knowthe sensations so accurately? And was there not something of the witch-doctor inme yet? How otherwise to account for my psychic powers? Undoubtedly I was awitch-doctor still—I shivered—I with my strange, my sometimes baleful influenceon men’s lives, I with my mop of coarse hair that had fallen about my face orbeen flung out horizontally as I spun in the dance, I whom Epstein with his deepinsight had called “The Savage.”The most extraordinary thing about the whole matter was that Raoul’s friend nowshowed us what he had written on the paper, and to my astonishment it was in itsmain facts exactly the same as the story my husband had just told. It was aremarkable and rather creepy thing.I did not see Raoul’s friend for some days after this, and when I did I was tobe further initiated into the occult. We were having tea in one of the teashopsin Oxford, eating, I remember, some Swedish tea cakes, and talking about nothingin particular, when the cat-eyed gentleman, who seemed far less uncanny bydaylight and in a crowd, suddenly interrupted our small talk by saying: “Youwill see me at midnight to-night.”I laughed and answered by quoting the song, “Meet me in dreamland to-night.”We said no more of it, and went on discussing the latest play at the NewTheatre, or somebody’s cocktail party, or the most recent exploits of themountaineering club, or whatever it was. Nevertheless, at twelve o’clock thatnight I awoke with a feeling that there was a third person in the room.Terrified, I opened my eyes, and looked to see. Yes ! There he was, standingclose to the side of the bed. I woke Raoul.“Look!” I said, “can you see him?”“Yes,” he replied without surprise. “It’s ——.He’s sent his body out on to theastral plane.”I afterwards learnt that this man was well known as a psychic and clairvoyant,and as a result of this incident Raoul was very angry with him for frighteningme in this way.We stayed in Oxford for a few days after “Commem,” and then returned to Londonand took a room at the Harlequin, which was run by one of the waiters who hadbeen at the Café Royal. He was a Greek and was always known as Johnny. A verysad thing happened to him a short time later. He was sent to prison for sometrifling offence— selling drink after hours or something like that—and, owing tohis good behaviour, was let out two days before his time. He came back to hishouse, which collapsed almost as soon as he had got inside and killed him. Ifonly he had not behaved himself so well in prison the house would have fallendown while he was still in there.We were very hard up. Raoul had practically no money and had accumulated largedebts with tailors and booksellers in Oxford. Nor was he in a position to earnany, since his ambition was to be an Egyptologist, for which, though he showedgreat aptitude, he had not yet had time for sufficient study. So to enable himto qualify for his chosen profession I took to sitting again. The pound a daythat I made was just enough to keep the two of us. Raoul used to go to theBritish Museum or some other library or museum every day to continue hisstudies.Among the books that my husband brought home with him I noticed more than one bythe occultist and mystical poet whom Raoul had talked about with such enthusiasmto his weird friend in Oxford. I looked at these with a certain amount ofapprehension. I had always heard that their author was reputed to have anuncanny power over young men, and I was jealous of anybody in whom Raoul mighttake a keener interest than in myself. The event proved that my fears werejustified.One day when we were dining together in the Harlequin a woman friend came overto speak to me.I introduced her to Raoul, and the conversation worked round to occultism.Learning that he was interested, she said that he ought to meet this man. Heleapt at the suggestion.“I should like to very much,” he said. “When could it be arranged?”“He’s staying at my house now,” she replied.I tried to dissuade Raoul by refusing to go myself, but so eager was he to makethe acquaintance of his hero that he went without me.For two days and nights he did not return. I was frightfully worried, as you canimagine. I could not think what had happened to him. I wondered if he had beenrun over or had some other accident of some kind, and his body was lyingunidentified, so that I should perhaps never hear of him again or know what hadhappened to him. On the night of the third day I was awakened by the sound ofsomeone trying to open my bedroom window. It was Raoul. We were on the thirdfloor in one of those tall houses in Beak Street, just off Regent Street, and hehad climbed from the street. He was covered with dust and soot, and his breathreeked of ether. I put him to bed, where he lay in a doped sleep until themiddle of the following day.When he awoke I found out that he had spent the whole time he had been away withthe great mystic, and that he had taken the drug to excite the mysticalactivities of his soul.After my own experience of drug-taking I was naturally anxious to prevent himgetting the habit, and I succeeded in extracting a promise from him not to takedrugs again. The promise, however, given in a moment of remorse, could notrestrain him from accepting a second invitation. I protested in vain. He went,and returned three days later in the same condition as before. I learnt, too,that all the time I was absent posing he spent with this man. It was not goodenough. I told him plainly that if he did not give up this practice I shouldleave him. He could choose between me and the Mystic. And to help him to resistthe temptation I engaged another room whose address should not be known. For atime this plan succeeded—until one day there was a knock at the door. I openedit, and, to my great surprise, beheld a ponderous man attired in a Highlandkilt, standing in an attitude of benediction with both hands raised and in oneof them a green wand about five feet in length, round which coiled asymbolic’snake. On one of his very small hands was a curious ring. I rememberedhaving seen him years before in 1914. He had dark, glowing, hypnotic eyes and aloose sallow skin, with very full red lips. He had a massive head, on which wasplaced a glossy, black curly wig. I discovered afterwards that his head wasshaved except for a few strands of hair in front cultivated in a significantform.“Do what thou wilt,” he pronounced in a slightly nasal accent, which made thewords sound less impressive than they would otherwise have done, “do what thouwilt shall be the whole of the law.”Like a verger leading a congregation in the responses, my husband intoned inreply, “Love is the law, love under will.”Resisting an impulse to declaim “Macgregor, Macgregor, remember our foemen,” Iheld out my hand to him, to which, bending over it, he pressed his small and redcupid’s-bow mouth.Then he extracted a large bottle of hock from his sporran and announced hisintention of remaining to dinner.This insolence infuriated me. I snatched up my cape and prepared to go out. TheMystic tried to detain me with an imperious gesture of one of his dainty littlehands, but I was not awed.“I will not cook dinner for you,” I said.Then the Mystic smiled. “A time will come,” he said, “when you will cook all mymeals for me.” How stupid I thought that remark at the time! How little Iguessed that he spoke of a time that was not far off.I remarked over my shoulder as I went out, “There’s plenty of food—you can havemine.”Raoul looked as if I had uttered blasphemy against the Most High.I knew that the Mystic was looked upon by some as the greatest genius of moderntimes. One of his many books has been compared to Frazer’s “Golden Bough,” andas a master of Eastern magic he was unequalled. I mention these things to showthat I had good reason to regard him as a dangerous opponent.I went out into the street in a rage of jealousy. I had been turned out of myown house by this man. He had decisively won the first round. Fear and pridewere raging inside me. I dreaded to lose Raoul, and yet I could not humiliatemyself either before him or before my rival. Above all, not before my rival.I therefore stayed out until well after midnight, when I was sure he would begone, and then looked carefully to see if there were a light burning in our flatbefore I went in. There was. I waited for half an hour in the shadow of adoorway, fearing any moment to be had up for loitering with felonious intent.Even if I were, I reflected bitterly, Raoul probably wouldn’t trouble to bail meout. I was just his drudge now, his drudge and his woman. I thought of the timeswhen we used to walk round Golden Square, and cried. I continued to standoutside.After an interminable half-hour the light was still there. I could wait nolonger. I decided to creep up the stairs and listen outside the door to hear ifthere were still voices, since it was possible that Raoul had repented and waswaiting up for me. This, however, was not so, for just as I emerged from mylurking-place I saw our street door open and the bulky, kilted form of theMystic step out on to the pavement, where he stood chatting for a few minutes toRaoul. They made another appointment and parted with the utmost cordiality. Myheart burst with pity for myself and hatred of the Mystic. Raoul didn’t care,nobody cared, what happened to me, I felt. I had better go away quietly, anddie. But how could he prefer this man to me !I allowed time for Raoul to go upstairs and settle down before I followed him. Iopened the door timidly. My pride was worn down by what I had been through. Ifonly he would be even kind to me. . . . I crossed over to where he was sittingand fell at his feet, saying only “Raoul.”He looked down at me as if he had not observed my entry, and raising hiseyebrows, asked if I had had a good time.“Oh, Raoul,” I said, crying again, “what is it?” I felt him shrink from me.“What’s what ?”“You know. You don’t like me any more.”“Nonsense.”“Well, why are you angry?”“You were extraordinarily rude to my guest.”“Please don’t have anything more to do with him,” I entreated.“This is intolerable,” he replied, getting up and starting to walk about theroom. “You can’t dictate who shall be my friends.”“But I don’t like him.”“Nor do I like a lot of your friends, but that doesn’t prevent my being politeto them when I meet them.”I saw that Raoul was really angry and that it was no good talking to him in thismood or trying to bring him to reason and to see my point of view. At last hesaid,“If you like I’ll arrange so far as possible to see him when you aren’t there.But I insist that if he comes here again you are to be civil to him.”This was not at all what I wanted, so I gave up the argument and tried to winRaoul over by endearments. But he remained angry, and I could get no responsefrom him except a number of sarcastic remarks such as, “He is an extremelyintelligent man, and I must have some intelligent conversation even if I ammarried.”At length I gave up my attempt at conciliation, and said that since he no longercared for me I no longer intended to work for him.However, our quarrel was not of long duration. We had fallen out because we werein love and we soon made it up for the same reason.And then came a piece of marvellous good fortune which delighted us both, andwhich I thought was going to do away with all my difficulties and fears. Awell-known titled man whom we had recently met offered Raoul a job at a salaryof £1,000 a year. I was in favour of closing with the offer at once, but Raoulwould not take it at once on the excuse of completing some research work he wasengaged on at the moment, and I agreed not to insist about it. It was arrangedthat Raoul should take up the appointment in six months’ time. Now everythingseemed all right. All our troubles were at an end. I was full of excitement atthe prospect of having some money and being able to live more comfortably.I had meanwhile seen nothing of the Mystic for some time, and in the excitementcaused by Raoul’s new prospects half forgotten about him. But his influence overRaoul remained as strong as ever. They continued seeing one another while I wasout at work, and must have then decided, though I was not informed of it tilllater, that Raoul should join him at Cefalu in Sicily, whither he was about toreturn, in the capacity of the Mystic’s private secretary.For this purpose money was required. It was as much as we could do to live, muchless get to Sicily. Accordingly the Mystic sent word to Raoul that he must visita certain man whom he described as a great White Magician, but whose business inthis instance was nothing more supernatural than to advance enough money for ourfares to Sicily. This was the first definite reminder of the Mystic that I hadexperienced since the night he came to dinner, and my fears awoke all the morevigorous for their rest. Fearful for Raoul, and doubtful of either his abilityor his desire not to get further involved with this business, I insisted onaccompanying him to the house of the White Magician. At least I could keep aneye on him in this way.The White Magician turned out to be a pleasant and a cultured man. His wife tooappeared a sensible person. They were very kind to us both. I began to feel alittle reassured. But even here, even in this sane and comfortable household,the thing made itself felt. Even here the name of the Mystic was mentioned withreverence, almost with awe. It annoyed me to hear this otherwise normal manreferring to the Mystic as if he were something superhuman. And it frightened metoo, a little. Was there no escape from him? Should I too become involved?A few days later I saw him once more in the flesh. I was dining with Raoul inthe Harlequin with a party consisting of some other models and one or twofriends of Raoul’s from Oxford. I think they were Dolores, Chequita, AllanPorter, Bertram Higgins, Arthur Read, and one or two others. We were having avery gay time. Raoul was in excellent form, and evidently much enjoyed hearingnew anecdotes about familiar members of his old university. I as always enjoyedthe company of undergraduates. In the end we were very hilarious, as were manyof the parties at neighbouring tables. Then suddenly I saw in the doorway thefigure of the Mystic, dressed as before in a kilt, and holding his green snakewand aloft in one hand.“Do what thou wilt, shall be the whole of the law,” he boomed.This was greeted with a roar of laughter from everyone in the room except Raoul,who as solemnly replied, “Love is the law, love under will.”A further peal of laughter followed, even louder than the first.I cannot describe to you how extraordinary a scene it was in this night clubseeing a man dressed in these clothes and behaving in this way.The Mystic moved across to our table, where Raoul immediately invited him to sitdown. Mindful of my promise to Raoul, I treated him with all the civility Icould manage. The others looked at him in astonishment.Conversation was stifled by his presence, and I could see he was delighted bythe embarrassment he was causing. His eyes rested mesmerically on each of thegirls in turn, and from time to time he broke the oppressive silence with aremark usually of the most curious kind. To me alone did he take any pains to bepleasant. He complimented me on my appearance and smirked and smiled in a ratherridiculous manner. Then his eye lighted one of the paintings of me by Kramerthat hung just over the fireplace opposite the door. He placed his chair infront of it and sat in silent contemplation—not, I am sure, unconscious of theattention he was attracting—for the space of about five minutes. On his returnhe declared himself much impressed with the artist’s capabilities, so much so infact that he had decided to commission him to do a full-length picture ofhimself in all his hieratic robes.Before he went he fixed me with a meaning stare and said, “It is destined thatyour path shall cross mine.”I too felt that this was not improbable, and was determined to make every effortin my power to avoid such a thing. But my confidence was beginning to wane. Inspite of all my scheming and protests Raoul continued to see this man, and camemore and more subdued to his influence. He repeatedly stayed away for days onend, and always returned reeking of ether. The struggle certainly seemed to begoing in the Mystic’s direction.image [images/f139-01.jpg]BETTY MAY—“THE SPHINX.” BY JACOB KRAMER [06_illustrations.xhtml#fig_07]I did not know what to do. There seemed to be absolutely no way of getting holdof my husband and really persuading him to give up all this sort of thing.On more than one occasion I had actually fetched Raoul away from the house inHolland Park where the Mystic was staying, and where he had temporarilyestablished a temple of his cult.Once when I went there on my usual errand I was admitted by the Mystic himself.He did not seem in the least surprised to see me.“I have been waiting for you,” he said. “Come in.”“Oh, yes,” I answered jauntily, “is Raoul here ?”His only reply was, “Follow me.”I did, expecting to be conducted to my husband, but instead of doing this he ledme upstairs to a bedroom, where he seated himself on a chair and commanded me tokneel at his feet. I laughed in his face. I could not help it. He was furious.Among his followers his word was law, and his person very nearly an object ofworship. He lived in a carefully maintained atmosphere of veneration, and herewas I, an impertinent little slip of a model, practically putting out my tongueat him. I could see that he was almost as surprised as angry, and pressed homemy advantage by pretending to find him even more comical than I really did. Atlength he stood up and denounced me at the top of his voice. This brought thelady of the house running to see what was the matter. I demanded of her to betaken to my husband. She complied, and I left the Mystic glowering. But mypersonal triumph was entirely counteracted by Raoul’s refusal to accompany me.“I’ll come later,” he promised.This was ominous, as he had never before refused to come away when I went tofetch him.He returned a day or two later suffering more severely than I had yet known himto from the effect of drugs. It was useless to argue with him. I could only tryby the exercise of especial tenderness to regain my partially lost ascendancyover him, and to supplant as far as possible that of the Mystic. In hisremorseful state Raoul was an amenable subject. With my own experience ofdrugging I made a sympathetic nurse, taking him out for walks in the park, andcooking him the most delightful little meals (I am a very clever cook), andstriving in every way to interest him in ordinary life and to cure him of hisobsession. My efforts met with unexpected success. The Mystic was nevermentioned by either of us. Our earlier affection revived. I even persuaded himto take up the position he had been offered at once without waiting until theremainder of the six months had passed. When he had agreed to this, I felt oncemore that our troubles were at an end. If I could only keep him to his promise Ifelt that he would become interested in his work and would give up this side ofhis life. But I was not to have so easy, even if so delayed, a victory. I waspreparing our evening meal while Raoul read in the sitting-room, feeling happyabout the present and confident for the future—we should be extremelycomfortable on £1,000 a year. I even began to plot out how we should spend it—when my attention was called by the sound of something being put heavily down onthe kitchen table and by the voice that of all voices I least desired to hear,saying, “Cook that.”“Go to Hell!” I retorted. It was too much. All my hopes were destroyed. I knewRaoul would not be able to resist. Nevertheless I attempted one trial ofstrength between my own influence over him and the Mystic’s. Quickly putting onmy cape and hat, I went into the sitting-room, whither the Mystic had returned,and said, untruthfully, to Raoul, “Oh, Raoul—I forgot—we’re dining with theEpsteins to-night, so I’m afraid we can’t ask the gentleman to stop.”I waited anxiously for his reply. Would he ?—no, he couldn’t let me down infront of a third person. It was an agonizing moment, a turning-point.“Nonsense,” said Raoul petulantly.“You must have forgotten,” I replied defiantly, and with equal insolence. “Iwill make your excuses to them and say that you’re ill.” With that I walked outof the flat, knowing, but not yet admitting to myself, that I was beaten. I wentout and had a miserable meal by myself. I now felt there was nothing to be done.It was useless to struggle against fate. I felt that perhaps my foreboding wasexaggerated, and yet it was too strong for me to get rid of altogether. I wisheddesperately that I could win Raoul back.Raoul now resumed all his old ways, seeing the Mystic every day and often notreturning home for several nights on end. One of the people who was very kind tome during this awful period was Euphemia Lamb, and I can never be gratefulenough to her for it. I was in despair. As a last resort, when he had beencontinuously absent for a longer period than ever before, I went to theEpsteins, on whom I could always rely in times of trouble. Epstein, with hisbulk and his kindliness, was somehow a reassuring thought, as was hissympathetic and capable wife, Peggy. I went to them and related all that hadhappened, and asked them to come with me to fetch Raoul away. They werecharming. I was soothed and comforted and no longer felt that I was fightingalone against some malignant and intangible force. They told me not to befrightened and promised to accompany me to Holland Park after we had had lunch.Accordingly, Epstein, Peggy, another model and myself, set off in the earlyafternoon for the tabernacle, or temporary temple, of the Thelemite cult.We were shown into a splendid reception room, where, after a dignified intervalhad elapsed, the High Priest (who was, of course, the Mystic) came in to us,attired in all his robes and jewels of office.After the greetings were over he squatted on the floor in a position he hadlearned during his travels in India and Tibet, and delivered a long, and, I ambound to admit, interesting talk on the occult, quoting his own works on thesubject, which were numerous. He was certainly an astonishing man. I will tryand tell you as much about him as I have been able to discover during the time Ihave known him and from things I have heard about him since. A great deal of itis uncertain, but the facts seem to be as follows. His origin and early life areobscure, but it seems he had spent many years studying mysticism at first handin the East, and that he is known to have practised for a time the extremelyarduous profession of a fakir. Before and during the war he was in Americafounding a chain of temples of his cult. The professed aim of the Thelemitecreed is to penetrate into the deeper mysteries of creation, and to free thespirit from the trammels of the flesh. As far as I could gather, the method ofliberation they adopt is to satiate the senses with the idea of, so to speak,coming out at the other side. It is not difficult to realize that some of theweaker vessels never succeed in emerging, or perhaps do not even wish to do so.Certainly the cult became associated with practices which met with greatopposition from the American authorities. The Mystic left America, as he wassoon to leave the house he was staying in now.The present visit was, for me at any rate, very upsetting. When we succeeded atlast in breaking into his discourse and making our reason for coming known,Raoul was summoned, and himself, a second time, refused to leave.My misery at Raoul’s refusal was mitigated by the news he brought to me on hisreturn, that the Mystic had actually left for Italy. With that man out of theway, I thought, I still had a chance of rescuing Raoul from his domination. ButI was wrong.For some time we lived happily together as we had done before during the periodthat Raoul was more or less under my influence, and I had had hopes that I couldwin him back again. It really looked this time as if things would be all right.Then one morning among our letters I noticed one with an Italian stamp,addressed to Raoul. I hesitated whether to give it to him or not, and to thisday I am sorry that I eventually decided to do so. It was an invitation, orrather a summons, from the Mystic to go out to him in Cefalu. After reading itRaoul announced,“We are going to Italy.”The blow had fallen. There seemed nothing more to be done. As you can imagine,to go to Sicily was the very last thing I wanted to do. There I knew I shouldhave even less control over Raoul than here.“You go alone.” It was my last card. I watched his face intently, trying tofollow the course of his inward struggle. When he spoke I knew I had lost.“Very well,” he agreed, “I go alone.”I have never felt so hopelessly unhappy."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VIITHE ABBEYWe embark for Sicily—Discomforts of the journey—Cefalu—We arrive at theAbbey—Life in the Abbey—The razors—Jack the Ripper’s ties —“We shall sacrificeSister Sybiline at eight o’clock to-night”—Pentagram—Raoul’s ill-health—Thesacrifice of the cat—The death of Raoul—Raoul’s burial—I return to England.MY threat had of course been pure bluff. As soon as I saw that nothing, not evenlosing me, would stop Raoul from going to the Abbey, I promised to accompanyhim. He was delighted at this, for although I know he would have gone without meif I had refused to go, I also knew that it would be a terrible wrench for himto do this. He seemed very relieved and did not stop from explaining to me thatall my fears were quite groundless. We began making arrangements to go at once.We spent a week on making preparations for the journey. Lack of money, for Raoulhad only secured just enough from the White Magician for our fares, made itnecessary that we should take very little luggage with us. I had a hard timeselecting what we should pack and what we should leave behind. At lasteverything was ready down to the last of Raoul’s shirts, about which he was veryparticular, and which, in an impish moment, I had “twinked” all the colours ofthe rainbow. He was very angry when he found out what I had done.Before leaving, we gave a farewell dinner at the Harlequin. Epstein and Peggywere sitting in one corner, and many others of my friends in different parts ofthe room.This had been my life, and these my friends, and I was leaving them.After we had had our coffee I went over to speak to the Epsteins to saygood-bye. It was Epstein who had first spoken to me in the Café Royal, when Iwas a little girl. At that moment he symbolized for me all the life that I wasleaving. I thought of the days I had spent in his studio posing for “TheSavage,” and of all the times since then that I had resorted to him to help meout of a difficulty. Could he not help me now ? After all, I was still here. Noone could force me to go away. So I reflected, knowing, however, all the timethat I had to go, that it was fated I should go. And yet I half hoped that hewould be able to extricate me from my position. Surely he would be able tosuggest some way out that I had not thought of. But even Epstein could only say,“Don’t go, Betty. If you do, one of you will never come back again.”That night we left Victoria for Paris.How can I describe the unhappiness of our journey ? I was weighed down withgloom. And perhaps because of this I remember it as vividly as if it hadhappened but a week or two ago. Raoul was depressed too, though he would notadmit it, and he was helped by being buoyed up with a sort of excitement.The sky was cloudy and a strong, cold wind was blowing when we arrived atNewhaven. As we got out on to the platform I could just distinguish some way offat the quayside the black bulk of our boat and the sailors and porters scuttlingup and down the gangway with luggage on their backs. There were no lights in thestation hotel and none in the bleak little town. Only, now and then, one of ourfellow passengers (I felt each of them must be the possessor of a guilty secretor the victim of a great misfortune) would light a pipe or a cigarette as hemarched up and down the platform to keep warm. Occasionally I caught a whiff ofFrench tobacco, or a scrap of French conversation, which reminded me of myprevious adventures across the Channel. The wind smelt of the sea and stung asif it were full of minced ice.While Raoul and a porter were getting our baggage on board I stared across theshiny rippling water of the harbour at the round black hills on the other side,and followed the line of them round to the narrow harbour mouth where I couldjust distinguish the solitary winking eye of the lighthouse. Beyond the Channelwaves were all crested. We were to have a bad crossing.Lack of money had compelled us to travel third class all the way, and I foundthat the quarters below were so crowded, and with such unpleasant people, thatin spite of the cold it was better to spend the night on deck. I got hold of acomparatively sheltered place and prepared with the aid of a rug and a littlebrandy to face the discomforts of the voyage. Raoul preferred to remain below.The first hour passed slowly enough. The next three seemed endless. As we drewout of the harbour I watched the lighthouse until it dropped out of sight. “Oneof you will never come back,” Epstein had said. Which of us, I wondered, woulddie ? And in what state would the other return?I felt that our farewell dinner had taken place ages ago, although in fact thesun had not risen since. For a time I was afraid and exhilarated. But graduallycold, hunger, stiffness and fatigue entirely took the place of any otherfeelings, and we might, for all I cared, find the devil himself on the otherside, if only we found also a cup of hot coffee.At last I found myself in the train for Paris, where I was suffocated instead offrozen. Part of the time I slept. The rest I occupied in looking out of thewindow. It was November. A weak yellow sun only succeeded at intervals inbreaking through the grey cloud banks. The wind had dropped and mist hung aroundthe bare looking orchards. The last time I had seen Normandy had been in spring.By the time we reached the outer suburbs of Paris my chief emotion was ofexcitement at the prospect of revisiting old scenes. Those had been astoundingdays. My life then was a story to be told and to be wondered at. And now theTiger-Woman was returning to Paris—in tailor-mades and a wedding ring!On arriving at the Gare du Nord, we walked all the way to Montparnasse to savethe few pence it would have cost to have taken a taxi. I do not know how far itis. It seemed miles and miles and miles. We were worn out when we at lastreached the Latin Quarter and sat down to a meal. We then had to spend the timeuntil ten o’clock, when our train left for Rome. Inevitably we found ourselvesat the Rotonde, where, as was likely, we met several acquaintances. Among themwas Lord ——, who was going to give Raoul a job at £1,000 a year. He wassurprised to see us in Paris, as he imagined Raoul was studying archaeology inLondon.“What on earth are you doing here?” he asked.Raoul told him that we were going to the abbey of the Mystic in Cefalu. He wasindignant. Getting up, he said in a freezing manner, “I’m sorry, but in thatcase I do not wish to have any further dealings with you.”It was more or less what I had expected. I felt that he had a certain right tobe annoyed after all he had tried to do to help us and by his kindness inoffering Raoul this job.This incident brought home to me the folly of what we were doing, and determinedme to make one last effort to frustrate Raoul’s design. If only I could persuadehim to spend just one night in Paris our funds would be too exhausted for us togo on to Italy. I became very gay, hoping that he would drink a good deal, andin that state not think very much of putting off our departure for a day. Butalas, Raoul showed a great resolution. Paris could offer him no temptations tomake up for any unnecessary delay in seeing his hero. My efforts were of noavail. We arrived at the station in good time for the train, and Raoul boughtthe tickets with what was very nearly our last franc.For me the excitement of travelling had quite worn off. I no longer had anydesire for new scenes. Fear and the longing for security were my only feelings.I had no desire for adventure. There was no joy in it for me as there was forRaoul. For me there were only senseless risks and a senseless throwing away ofhappiness. Why should I be called upon to make this sacrifice ? I railedinwardly at the injustice, and was filled with fierce resentment against Raoul.The violence of my feelings and the discomfort of the third class carriagecombined to prevent my sleeping, and I got out of the train at Modane at 6.30 inan indescribably miserable condition, both of mind and body. Here we weredelayed for five or six hours by the Customs, owing to the badness of Raoul’suniversity Italian.Again it seemed that the journey would go on for ever. We were always having toget out and change trains, or get into other carriages for no apparent reason.By difficult stages we at length arrived in Sicily. I cannot describe how awfulthat journey was. Italian peasants spat all over the place in the carriage. I amused to being uncomfortable, but I do not know how I survived it. Extremelyhungry, we spent our last money on food, and Raoul announced that he would haveto sell my wedding ring to pay our fares from Palermo to Cefalu. We found anEnglish chemist who told us of a place where he thought we could dispose of thering. We followed his directions and entered an evil-smelling cellar, in whichwe found a Sicilian who regarded the ring and ourselves with equal suspicion.After long negotiations, conducted mainly by means of gesture, a bargain wasstruck, and we returned to the station with the money, and bought our tickets,receiving only about the equivalent of one halfpenny in change. So that, Ithought, is all I am to Raoul. My ring means less to him than the journey fromPalermo to Cefalu. I was furious, and desperately humiliated. Very well then, Icontinued my train of thought, since I am nothing to him in comparison with theMystic, there can be no place for me at the abbey, and acting upon thisconclusion I flung down the suit-case I was carrying and ran out of the station.At first I had no idea of where I was going, and no intention except to get awayfrom Raoul and not to return to the station until the train had gone. At lengthI became tired, and it occurred to me to go to the British consul and ask to besent home.Knowing no Italian, I was unable to ask my way, and spent some hours searchingfor the consulate, which as a matter of fact I could never succeed in finding.While I paused to try and think, I found I was surrounded by the most terrifyinglooking Sicilians. They were huge greasy men, and some of them came up and heldout money in their hands towards me. One or two even stroked my arm, but Irushed away on my hopeless search. But during this time I experienced what iscalled a change of heart. I found it more and more difficult to believe thatRaoul could possibly find these things more interesting than myself. As mysearch grew more prolonged and more hopeless, my doubt grew to a certainty. Ihad judged Raoul too hastily. The ring was, after all, the only saleableproperty he had with him, and we could not remain in Palermo without money. Iceased to believe he had any intention to slight myself, and gave him the creditof being only temporarily dazzled by the attainments of the Mystic.I hardly knew what to do. I dared not stand about to try and collect mythoughts, in case I should be attacked by Sicilians. I hardly dared ask any onethe way. In any case I did not know where I wanted to go.I had by now given up all hope of finding the consulate, even if I wished to doso. My only alternative was, therefore, to return to my husband, which I did. Ifound my way to the station by imitating a train in the manner of children atplay, a mode of expression which was luckily understood by the natives. At thestation, as in the town, I found no one who could speak English, and had toresort again to dumb-show in order to find my husband. I was first taken to theluggage-room, where, to my relief, was a youth who knew about four words ofEnglish. He understood and complied with my request to be conducted to thewaiting-room.There, to my joy and surprise, I found Raoul sitting on the table andunconcernedly swinging his legs as though there had been nothing out of theordinary in my desertion. I was not so unmoved.Tears, kisses, confession and forgiveness left me happier than I had been sincewe started on our journey, and it was in a soft and loving mood that I entrainedfor Cefalu. For most of the forty-six miles my hand was in Raoul’s.It was nine o’clock and pitch dark when we arrived at our destination. Thevillage of Cefalu lies between a range of bare rock-strewn hills and the sea.The abbey, which is a white oblong farm-house, looks down on the village fromthe hills.On alighting from the train, we made our way towards the village, but chancingto meet a man, Raoul tried his Italian once more. Probably from his accent theman realized that we were English, for he replied in that language. He turnedout to be an Italian who had been for some years in America, and later on he wasvery useful to me.“Do you want the High Priest?” he asked.“Damn the High Priest,” I told him. “We want to see ——.” I mentioned the Mysticby name.“He is the High Priest,” was the amazing reply, and rather than argue the pointwe said we should like to be directed to him, whereupon he offered to take usthere, as otherwise we were likely to get lost, even if we did not fall over aprecipice and kill ourselves. It was a long walk up the narrow winding mountainpath, and I noticed with apprehension that our guide’s account of its dangerswas not at all exaggerated. On the way we met various friends of the man who wasdirecting us, and as no one ever seems to have anything to do in Sicily exceptwander about and talk, we were soon followed by an absolute army of people whohelped to escort us on our way, awful looking ruffians most of them.From time to time the lights of the village came into sight—further away on eachoccasion, and as we approached the end of our climb we could see a single steadylight which we were told was the abbey. It was called the Friendly Light, sinceits purpose was to guide lost wayfarers thither, where they could always obtainfood and shelter, and I thought with a sudden thrill of dread of the lighthouseoutside Newhaven harbour, wondering whether I should ever see it again.At last we came to the abbey. Raoul rapped on the door.We waited a few moments. The door was flung open. There stood the Mystic in allthe glory of his ceremonial robes. He had evidently prepared for our arrival.He simply said, “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law!”Raoul replied, “Love is the law, love under will.” I was silent and angry.“Enter,” said the Mystic to Raoul, as if inviting him only, and before I knewwhat had happened my husband had disappeared through the door, which was shut inmy face. I was alone among these frightful looking Sicilians, who once more (asthey had done when I had been left alone previously) crowded round me,chattering and shouting and trying to drag me away with them. I rushed up to thedoor and began to beat on it. At first nothing happened, and then after a fewminutes the Mystic reappeared.“Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law,” he repeated.I only said “Good evening.”He was furious and absolutely quivering with rage.“If you don’t say, ‘Love is the law, love under will,’ you will not be allowedinto the Abbey,” he said. Obviously I could not risk staying outside, so Iobeyed and was allowed in.Once inside, the Mystic disappeared again and I found myself alone with adown-at-heel looking woman whose name I learnt was Shummy. I looked at her andsaw she was with child and nearing her time.“You poor thing,” she said to me, “you must be nearly famished. I’ll get yousome tea.” She went out of the room, and I now began to look round to see whatmy new surroundings were like. They were just as extraordinary as I had expectedthem to be. I will try to describe them, but I shall have great difficulty inconveying the very curious impression they made on me.I occupied the interval while she was fetching the tea in taking stock of mysurroundings, so far as the dim light of a few candles permitted. The large,bare entrance hall had been fitted up as a temple of the cult. In the centre ofthe room stood the altar, a seven-sided erection about three feet in height. Onit reposed a heavily bound book, surrounded by candles, only lighted on ritualoccasions, and purchased, as I learnt later, second-hand from the church atCefalu (which struck me as being rather comic). Two of the seven sides of thealtar were painted yellow, two green and three purple. One of the panels openedand disclosed a sort of cupboard, in which were kept the incense and “cakes oflight.”The floor of the temple was of a dark red. Around the altar a circle was markedout in a deeper red, and within the circle was defined a star whose five pointstouched the circumference. This was painted blue. At one point of the staropposite one of the purple panels stood an impressive carved throne, the throneof the Mystic, or as he called himself, “The Purple Priest.” At the remainingfour points were placed triangular stools, each about a foot high. In front ofthe throne stood a sacrificial brazier.Shummy soon returned with a tray on which were two chipped and ill-assortedcups, a tea-pot with a broken spout, and some milk in an old chianti bottle. Iwas very grateful for the tea, although it was very nasty. Tea, I afterwardslearnt, was very expensive and difficult to get. The milk had been obtained froma goat instead of a cow.I had another look at Shummy. She was a poor, frightened looking creature, whohad the appearance of always expecting, but never thinking to avoid, a blow. Itried to draw her gently into conversation. It puzzled me how she had got tothis place. Hers was evidently not a nature for spiritual austerities—or indeedfor bodily indulgence. Just a commonplace affectionate little thing, sheappeared to me. But if so, how had the Mystic got her into his power ? For thathe certainly had, I could see plainly. She never gave her whole attention towhat I was saying, but started continually and looked towards one of the doorsleading out of the hall. Gradually I became infected with her apprehension,until I too was watching that door intently. I was expecting the Mystic, and wasprepared for him in any dress or form. But I was not prepared for what actuallyappeared, and was as temporarily dazed. It was an apparition that would havestartled most people as it startled me, but it was less out of keeping thanShummy with the cabalistic fittings of the temple. The door suddenly opened. Atall haggard-faced woman clothed from neck to heels in a scarlet robe fastenedonly at the throat, and with a monkish cowl hanging down the back, glided slowlytowards us. Her huge dark eyes never left mine. In my overwrought state I wasfascinated by them. I felt as if I were gazing over a black abyss. I could notmove. As she approached us Shummy said softly, “This is Leah,” and thereupon gotup to receive the Mystic, who followed quickly on his forerunner. Both the otherwomen regarded him with rapt, devotional ardour.Raising his right hand, upon a finger of which was an emerald ring like acardinal’s, he gave his customary greeting, “Do what thou wilt shall be thewhole of the law.”“Love is the law, love under will,” all replied.“Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law,” uttered within sight of themagical pentagram, or five-pointed star. How odd it sounded.Then he turned to me. “So you have come to me,” he said with sardonicplayfulness, and I thought a note of triumph—“to cook, maybe.” He had some senseof dramatic irony. My mind flew back to the moment, months before, when I hadrefused to cook his dinner, and he had said, “A time will come when you willcook all my meals.”I made no reply, and he went on, “There is a book here” (indicating with agesture the volume on the altar) “containing the laws of the abbey. Everyone whoremains beneath this roof must sign it.”I went up to the altar, examined the book, which was bulky, and said to theMystic, “I shall not sign until I have read it.”“As you please,” he replied. “I will give you twenty-four hours, and if youhaven’t signed it by then——” He shrugged his shoulders, and went out, followedby Leah.Shummy and another girl called Jane, who had slipped in unnoticed by me, pursuedhis departing figure with cow-like reverential eyes. I saw that I was a heathenin a nest of fanatics. To disguise my uneasiness from the others and frommyself, I said with assumed carelessness, “Come, I’m tired. I want to go tobed.”Shummy showed me to our room.Physical fatigue made me sleep, but my agitation stopped me from refreshment.Raoul remained with the Mystic talking until about five o’clock in the morning.They had retired to the Mystic’s room (called the Koshmar) to do this. I had themost exhausting and fantastic dreams, and it took me some time when I awoke thenext morning to realize that my new home was not yet another place of nightmare.The room I found myself in was oblong in shape, and measured some twelve feet bysix by eight. There was no furniture except two chairs. We slept on a mattresson the floor. The absence of any washing things was explained later by thecustom of the abbey, which was for washing to be done in public in thecourtyard. And I may as well mention now that the abbey contained no sanitaryarrangements of any kind. This was the simple life with a vengeance.While lying between sleep and waking, I was wakened by the sound of a beatentom-tom, succeeded by a woman’s voice proclaiming, “Do what thou wilt shall bethe whole of the law.” And answered by a chorus in which I could detect thevoices of children, “Love is the law, love under will.”The now familiar words sounded rather beautiful as I lay watching the golden sunbeating down against the white stone wall opposite.We gathered that it was time to get up. Raoul, always something of a dandy, washorrified at the absence of toilet apparatus.“Monstrous!” he exclaimed several times, tramping up and down the room. “How thedevil am I expected to shave without any water? And there isn’t even a mirror.”Luckily I had a small mirror in my bag, which I held up for him while hearranged his collar and tie with unnecessary precision and carefully parted hisfair hair. But instead of being grateful for the smaller mercy, he remainedthoroughly angry.“How can I appear at breakfast looking like this?” he asked. “It’s all very wellfor you, you don’t have to shave. Here, let’s have another look in that mirror.”I had dressed myself in worse conditions before, and was not so much put out,although I too should have liked to wash away some of the grime collected duringour journey. But I am not sure that the sight of Raoul’s peevishness didn’tcompensate for any such discomfort.Meanwhile no one had come near us with any news of breakfast. I, ignorant of thedomestic arrangements of an abbey dedicated to these strange beliefs, wasuncertain and in favour of waiting. Raoul, however, had apparently no doubts,and strode into the temple, leaving me to follow.Seen by daylight the temple was even more extraordinary than I had thought. Onenoticed more acutely the fact that the abbey was a converted farmhouse, and thatthe ritualistic furniture had an out-of-place, temporary atmosphere about it. Itfelt rather as if one had strayed into a theatre where one had seen a play thenight before to find the scenery for the last act still erected the nextmorning. I also observed, what had escaped my previous notice, that the placecontained a considerable library, which Raoul was now eagerly examining. Theywere nearly all books on magic and other occult subjects, and among others wereall the publications of the Mystic himself.We were interrupted by the entrance of Shummy, who requested us to come tobreakfast. Following her into another room, we found the rest of the inhabitantsof the abbey—with the exception of the Mystic himself and Leah—already assembledround a bare deal table, drinking coffee, eating long loaves of Sicilian breadand a kind of cream-cheese made from goat’s milk.Here I saw the children whose voices I had heard earlier in the morning. Theywere two little boys about four years old, called Dionysius and Hermes, and alittle girl of two-and-a-half called Lulu. They were delightful children,healthy and well-fed, and with no appearance of being oppressed by theirunconventional surroundings. It quite cheered me up to see them here, and ashappy as this.The goat’s-milk cheese had a queer but not unpleasant flavour, quite unlikeanything I had tasted before. I did not know then, however, that this cheese wasone of the staple dishes of the abbey, and that in about two months’ time Ishould find it so utterly nauseating that starvation would be preferable toeating it. However, the coffee was delicious. Some of the best I have evertasted.During the meal nobody spoke, and on inquiring the reason for this, I was takeninto the temple, where the orders for the day were posted on a notice board.These always included silence for the earlier part of the day, and sometimes forthe entire twenty-four hours. And there were various other ordinances to beobserved.After breakfast I took the children for a walk, and Raoul occupied himself inthe library, which, he told me, was an excellent one, containing a uniquecollection of books on the occult in addition to all the published writings ofthe Mystic himself. The children, I found, were not at all shy, and quite readyto talk. I questioned them about the Mystic, and found that they had no awe ofhim beyond what all children have for persons in a position to punish them. Theyreferred to him, familiarly, as “Old Beast,” an endearing form of “The Beast666,” which was one of the many mysterious titles that he delighted to callhimself by.On our return I found the Mystic, who as a rule did not emerge from his privacybefore five o’clock, awaiting me. He gave a slow smile. He remarked, “You willbe ‘Sister Sibyline,’ and in future you will take over the complete householdduties, as Shummy is about to have a child. To-night you will attend Pentagramat eight o’clock.” (Pentagram was the principal service of the day.)“I shall not be at Pentagram,” I replied, “either tonight or any other night.”He met my defiance with confident assurance.“We shall see,” he said meaningly, and stalked away.I soon settled down into the routine of the abbey, although my relations withthe Mystic remained almost those of open warfare. He took pleasure in appointingme to the most humiliating tasks he could think of, and I took an almost equalpleasure in disobeying him and in wounding his vanity whenever possible. I wasrather grateful than otherwise for the necessity of getting up before the othermembers of the abbey, since I was thus enabled to perform my toilet inprivacy—or so I thought, until one day when completely naked at my ablutions, Ilooked up to see the grinning face of the Mystic regarding me. Neither of usspoke.Soon after our arrival the Mystic presented both Raoul and myself with razors,and told us that whenever any member of the abbey used the word “I” they must asa penance gash themselves with the razor. He only was allowed to say“I”—everybody else had to say “one.” I need hardly tell you that I did nothingof the sort. I spoke exactly as I should wherever I was. I believe I threw therazor away. But poor Raoul, who took the whole thing with deadly seriousness,could not prevent himself from constantly saying “I,” and he was soconscientious that he always wounded himself as a punishment, until his body wascovered with cuts. This was undoubtedly one of the things that undermined hishealth in the first place.All the men in the abbey had to shave off all their hair except for the onelittle symbolic curl in front. All the women had to dye their hair red every sixmonths, and then black again. They also had to keep it cut fairly short.Not only this, but everyone was supposed to keep a magical diary. The Mysticsaid to Raoul, “You must enter everything in it, you understand—everything. Evento your most innermost and sacred thoughts. And always what you say must betrue.”It was a fact that everyone kept a diary, and they were left about open foranyone to read who cared to take the trouble to do so. I read some of thediaries that had been kept in the past. They were amazing documents. There wereterrible things inside them. Some of them were attacks on the Mystic. “Writewhat you please, write exactly what you feel and think, but let it be true,” heused to say. He had a huge collection of these diaries, which must be documentsof quite extraordinary interest. And so life went on on these lines.It was my duty to do all the shopping and cooking, as well as to supervise thechildren when they were not doing physical exercises with Raoul. Our fare, asyou have probably inferred from our breakfast menu, was of the simplest. Eternalgoat’s-milk cheese, bread, tea, coffee and meat, when we had it, killed on thesame day and unbelievably tough. The wine alone was good, as the Mystic was agreat connoisseur of it. I had some of the best wine at the abbey that I hadever tasted.We had only three meals a day. Breakfast at about nine, dinner at one and tea athalf-past five. Everybody had to be present on these occasions, as for Pentagramin the evening, but apart from them, and from whatever duties they had toperform (Leah and Jane, for instance, acted as the Mystic’s secretaries and didall his typing, as he was always working and carried on a huge correspondence,sending letters all over the world), they could spend their time as they liked.The Mystic as a rule did not appear until tea time. He worked at his occultwritings most of the night and slept until one o’clock, when he took his dinnerin Koshmar, as his private room was called, with Leah.I used to take great pains in the preparation of these meals, but I do not thinkI can quite explain why. It was no doubt partly pride. Although not on terms offriendship with the Mystic, I was aware that my independence had exacted fromhim a certain measure of respect, which I valued dearly, and consequently I wascareful never to appear at a disadvantage before him. And he, I think, hadsomething of the same feeling for me. For instance, I was always the person heselected to go rock-climbing with him. Despite his bulk, he was an excellentclimber, cautious and yet daring, and of surprising agility. On theseexpeditions a tacit armistice was always respected between us, and he provedhimself as good a teacher as he was an exponent of the art. Infinitely patient,he succeeded in inspiring me with a confidence I have never felt with anyoneelse, even with my husband. “Remember,” he always warned me as we set out, “itis I who will get hurt first.”But these interludes had no lessening effect on our enmity within the abbey. AsI have said, the Mystic usually made his first public appearance at tea time.At meals he never used a knife or fork. He broke the food up with his fingers,but it was my duty to hold the towel and basin in which he did his ceremonialwashing before and after eating. One day I purposely poured the water all overhis head. He simply went on sitting there as if nothing had happened, and I wenton with the meal without offering any explanation. Neither of us ever referredto the incident again. This sort of episode was not uncommon in the abbey.I cannot describe how extraordinary it looked when we used to sit at deal tablesin this bare room with only the roughest furniture in it, some wearing themagnificent robes I have described. It was too odd for words. However, this wasour period of rest from the severe strain of mystical contemplation. But theconversation even then was of a solemn nature—laughter was never heard in theabbey—and more often than not consisted of a monologue delivered by the Mystic.At other times he would devote his whole attention to myself, in an attempt toput me at a disadvantage before my husband and the rest. However, I refused tobe drawn or to give any sign of embarrassment in spite of the fact that—as heknew well enough—the gross things he used to say caused me acute discomfort.On one occasion only did he really get the better of me. We were just about tobegin our tea when the Mystic got up, walked over to the brazier, and taking upone of the sacrificial knives, turned to the other members of the abbey andannounced in a casual tone, “We shall sacrifice Sister Sibyline at eight o’clockto-night.”For a moment I thought I must have mistaken his meaning. But hisattitude—testing the edge of the knife with his thumb—and his expressionconvinced me that I had not mistaken his intention.“You will be ready, Sister Sibyline,” he commanded.I was amazed. I was not conscious of having done anything particularly bad tomerit this, but, as you can well imagine, one’s nerves were never in a verystrong state at the abbey, and I always had a sort of lurking fear thatsomething of this kind might happen.I looked round at the others, expecting them to give some indication, if not ofsympathy, at least of surprise, at the prospect of a human sacrifice. But noone, not even Raoul, showed the slightest emotion, remaining as unmoved as ifthe Mystic had said there would be chicken for lunch to-morrow. It wasapparently a normal part of the Thelemite ritual.“So you really mean to kill me?” I asked the Mystic, not yet convinced that hewould dare to do so.He nodded gravely.“You are an evil spirit,” he told me. “You cannot be allowed to remain in theabbey to break every one of its rules in violation of the oath you took whensigning the book.”image [images/f169-01.jpg][Basil.BETTY MAY [06_illustrations.xhtml#fig_08]I had signed the book as I had come to the abbey, to be near Raoul. Surely, Ithought, he cannot allow me to be butchered for having loved him too well, andto the exclusion of my own safety. Surely in becoming a devotee of this cult hehas not entirely ceased to be a human being ! I turned to him in mute appeal.His eyes were as impassive as those of the rest.I was doomed, unless I could escape, which was not easy without money and in astrange country. All I could do was to get out of the abbey before the time ofthe sacrifice, and thereafter to make my way as best I could to Palermo and theBritish consul.I felt pretty hopeless at this prospect, as I had some experience of what itfelt like to be alone and penniless in Sicily, and also I knew the difficulty Ishould have in trying to find the consul, but I was too frightened for this toprevent me from taking the steps I did.I slipped out of the abbey and hid in the hills until after midnight. I wanderedabout a bit there, feeling more and more wretched. Then, led by some impulsethat I am unable to account for, I crept back to the abbey and past the lightedwindow of the Mystic’s study to the window of the room where I knew Raoul wassleeping. I stood outside for a few minutes, without any plan in my head. . . .And the next thing I was aware of was that the hand I had put through the windowhad been seized and a voice—my husband’s—was saying, “You silly girl—of courseit wasn’t meant. Where on earth have you been ?”I must tell you how one day I was going through one of the rooms in the abbeywhen I nearly fell over a small chest that was lying in the middle of it. Iopened it and saw inside a number of men’s ties. I pulled some of them out, andthen dropped them, for they were stiff and stained with something. For themoment I thought it must be blood. Later I found the Mystic and asked him aboutthe ties. He was in one of his kindly moods. “Sit down,” he said, “and I willtell you about them.” He then went on to say that these were the relics of oneof the most mysterious series of murders that the world had ever known. They hadbelonged to “Jack the Ripper”!“‘Jack the Ripper’ was before your time,” he went on. “But I knew him. I knewhim personally, and know where he is to-day. He gave me those ties. ‘Jack theRipper’ was a magician. He was one of the cleverest ever known and his crimeswere the outcome of his magical studies. The crimes were always of the samenature, and they were obviously carried out by a surgeon of extreme skill. ‘Jackthe Ripper’ was a well-known surgeon of his day. Whenever he was going to commita new crime he put on a new tie. Those are his ties, every one of which wassteeped in the blood of his victims. Many theories have been advanced to explainhow he managed to escape discovery. But ‘Jack the Ripper’ was not only aconsummate artist in the perpetration of his crimes. He had attained the highestpowers of magic and could make himself invisible. The ties that you found werethose he gave to me, the only relics of the most amazing murders in the historyof the world.”That is what the Mystic told me. I do not suggest that he did not say it only tofrighten me. Quite possibly he did. But still it seems to me an extraordinarystory which is certainly of interest. I have seen too many peculiar thingshappen to refuse to believe even anything so unlikely as this.After tea the Mystic would retire again for about an hour’s meditation beforePentagram. I have never taken part in this ritual, though I have often watchedit. The ceremony opened with the solemn entrance of the Mystic clad in thegorgeous robes of a Grand Master of the order of Freemasons. After he had seatedhimself on the throne before the brazier with the charcoal fire, around whichhung the sacrificial knives and swords, the other members of the cult took theirplaces on the triangular stools at the points of the star. They were dressed asa rule in robes like those in which I first saw Leah, with the cowls drawn downover their faces, and only their eyes visible through the narrow eye-slits.Clouds of incense hung about the room everywhere. When all were assembled, theMystic rose from his seat, and taking one of the swords from the side of thebrazier, held it pointing towards the altar while he intoned an invocation in alanguage with which I was not familiar. From hearing it every day, however, thesounds remain fixed in my memory.“Artay I was Malcooth—Fegabular,Vegadura, ee-ar-la—ah moon.”The last was a high-pitched note in contrast with the rest of the chant.Following this, he walked over to Raoul, rested the point of the sword on hisforehead, and uttered a further rigmarole, finishing up with a loud shriek of“Adonis,” which was the name by which my husband was known in the abbey. Then hewent through the identical performance in front of Leah, except that to beginwith he stood silently in front of her for a full minute, breathing deeply thewhile—breathing in the soul of his priestess, as Raoul explained it to meafterwards.These preliminary invocations done, the Mystic proceeded to execute a variety ofecstatic dances. This was both impressive and ludicrous. He lashed himself intoan absolute frenzy, brandishing his sword, and dancing and leaping about in themagic circle. His eyes blazed. The words he chanted had a compelling monotonousand exotic rhythm, and his eyes were alight with fanatical enthusiasm. EveryFriday night there was a special invocation to Pan, in which, as is shown by thehymn for these occasions, the doctrine of the cult became manifest. It waswritten in English, and I will quote the first few lines,“Thrill with lissom lust of the light,O Man, my Man ;Come careening out of the nightTo me, to me ;Come with Apollo in bridal dress——”The rest can hardly be reproduced here.The children had their own Pentagram at five o’clock before going to bed at six.They took this very seriously and performed the whole service themselves withoutany help from the others. Even little Lulu seemed quite as solemn about it asany of the grown-up people. It was one of the most extraordinary sights I haveever seen.After we had been at the abbey for some six or eight weeks—I forgetwhich—Raoul’s health began to give me some anxiety. An extraordinary lassitudetook the place of his previous high spirits. He no longer had the energy to takecharge of the children for their daily physical exercises, and sat about all dayin the main hall pretending to read. I hoped at first that his condition was theresult of some psychological stress arising out of his mystical activities. Butincreasing weakness showed that he was suffering from something more physicalthan mere morbidity. The Mystic, who had a great affection for Raoul, was alsoperturbed, and decided to cast his horoscope. Although I did not put any greattrust in this, I listened to the Mystic’s announcement of the conclusions of hisinvestigations with dread.“There is,” he said, “a great depression over you. A very gloomy depression. Itlooks as though you might die on the sixteenth of February at four o’clock.”I caught my breath, and he went on. “But you are young, and maybe you will pullthrough.”I had two explanations of Raoul’s illness, neither of which, as it happened,turned out to be correct. The first was drugs. As I have said before, drugs areoften used by occultists with the object of intensifying their mysticalexperiences, and in particular to enable them to separate soul from body and “goout on to the astral plane.” Large supplies of drugs were always available inKoshmar for anybody who wished to make use of them. (I ought to say here that itwas the rule of the abbey that no door should ever be locked.) Opium, hasheesh,cocaine, heroin, morphia, veronal, were all openly displayed. Raoul, on theMystic’s advice, and entirely against mine, had been taking a good deal ofhasheesh, and this I still believe, though not the immediate cause of hisillness, had done much to render him prone to infection.Although all these drugs were left about, there was never anything in the natureof drug orgies that I had seen in England. Only once, on a sudden impulse, oneof the women took an overdose of hasheesh. It was while Pentagram was inprogress, and she crawled into my room, writhing with pain. I went straight tothe Mystic, who was standing with his sword held aloft in both hands, utteringan incantation. I told him what had happened. He gazed at me with unseeing eyes,saying, “It does not matter. Go back to her.” He came about two hours later andscolded the wretched woman for having broken faith with him and with herself.“You may have your drugs,” he said, “you may have as much as necessary. But theyare for you to use to further your spiritual self. But you have abused them.” Hewent on in this way for some time, and every moment I thought the woman woulddie. Then he turned to me and ordered me to make some black coffee. A fewminutes after the woman had taken it she became herself again.My second theory about Raoul was that he had been poisoned in another manner. Ithappened in this way. In the Thelemite cult cats are regarded as evil spirits.Nevertheless there were two, Mischette and Mischu, that used to visit the abbeyregularly for surreptitious food given to them by myself. For a long time theycontinued undiscovered, until one day at tea the Mystic suddenly said, “There’san evil spirit in the room.”He looked about for a few seconds. A moment later he reached under the table anddragged out a large sandy cat, squirming, spitting, biting and scratching, whichI recognized as Mischette. She succeeded in scratching his arm severely beforehe flung her on the ground. Then Mischette fled from the temple, and the Mysticretired to Koshmar to put some iodine on his wounded arm. On his return hecommanded, “That cat must be sacrificed within three days.” Raoul was appointedto perform the sacrifice.Leading from the temple was a little scullery where I used to do some of mycooking and the washing up. It had a row of bars, and in between these and thewindow Mischette often used to sit. This used to happen even after the incidentI have just described, and more than once I took the cat and carried her a longway from the abbey and drove her away, so that she might escape beingsacrificed. But she always used to return and sit in the same place, so that atlast I decided that it was no good trying to help her any more. Then suddenlythe Mystic came into the scullery. At first Mischette jumped up as if to escape.The Mystic held up his wand and made the sign of the Pentagram. “You will notmove till the hour of sacrifice,” he said to the cat. The animal stiffened andbecame as if petrified. And then her eyes got that red look which animals getwhen they are really frightened. The next morning I got up early and once morecarried the cat, which allowed me to touch her, some way off to the rocks.Within an hour Mischette was back again in the same place. I threw her food, butshe would not eat it. There she remained for three days.A few hours before the ceremony was to take place, Raoul was ordered to capturethe cat, put her in a sack and deposit her in Koshmar. This he did, although hewas the gentlest of men who would not have hurt a fly in the ordinary course ofevents.Everybody took their accustomed position, except that for this occasion Raoul,as he was to be the executioner, changed places with the Mystic. The cat wasbrought out and placed, still in the sack, on the altar. The opening of the ritewas the same as the Pentagram, which I have already described. The air was thickwith incense. Raoul recited the invocation, and walked with upraised swordtowards Leah and the others and placed its point on their brows while he utteredthe usual formula. I sat outside the magic circle and watched the gruesomeperformance.Presently, when much of the ceremony had been gone through, I saw Raoul take akukri (Gurkha knife) from its place by the brazier and approach the altar, onwhich was the squirming sack. He untied it, drew forth the struggling andterrified Mischette by the scruff of the neck, and held her with his left handat arm’s-length above his head. In his right he held the kukri with its pointtowards the brazier. The Mystic stilled Mischette’s struggles by applying a dabof ether to her nose. All was now ready for the sacrificial invocation, whichRaoul had written specially for the occasion, and which he now had to recite inthe fatiguing posture that I have described.It was a long invocation, and before it was half done I could see his left armquiver with the strain. As he approached the point where the killing was to takeplace Leah stepped down from her triangular stool, and taking a bowl from thealtar, held it underneath Mischette to catch the blood, none of which issupposed to be lost. At last the moment had arrived. I saw him lift back thekukri, and then closed my eyes till it should be over. The sound of lowexclamations caused me to open them again, and I saw a horrible sight. Myhusband, unused to wielding such an awkward weapon as the kukri, had not strucktruly, with the result that he had only partially cut through the neck of thecat, which had escaped from his nerveless hands and was darting about the floorof the abbey, spitting and foaming at the mouth, and blood issuing from the gashin its neck in huge spurts. I was splashed where I sat in the shadow outside themagic circle, and a ghastly nausea came over me. Next I saw the Mysticapproaching my husband with the bleeding beast in his hand. The whole businesshad to be performed again. I was almost as sorry for Raoul as for Mischette.Indeed I hardly believed that he would be able to play his part, he trembled so.Even Leah, who must have been more inured than he to such scenes, could not holdthe bowl steady. But with a supreme effort he held out, and when the moment camemade no mistake at his second attempt to kill the cat, whose head was nearlysevered by the blow. Then swaying slightly, he laid the carcass on the altar.This done, his resources were exhausted, and the Mystic had to take over theconducting of the ceremony.Having concluded the invocation, he took the bowl containing the blood, utteredsome consecratory formula over it and handed it to Leah, who was standing by.Together they approached Raoul. The Mystic then flung back the cowl from Raoul’sface, and dipping a finger in the blood, traced the sign of the Pentagram on hiswhite, glistening forehead, and so to all the others, himself last.The final rite, the most disgusting of all, now alone remained to be performed.It makes me sick even now to think of it. The Mystic took a small silver cup,into which he scooped some of the blood from the bowl and handed it to myhusband, who drained it to the dregs.For a time I was convinced that Raoul had been poisoned by the blood ofMischette. But when he got steadily worse and a doctor was summoned I found outthat he was suffering from enteric, a not uncommon disease in those parts. Itwas then that I remembered how he had almost certainly caught this disease. Oneday the Mystic had told Raoul and me to go off for an expedition together. Hewas in one of his kindly moods and he said Raoul needed some relaxation. Hesuggested that we should go to a marvellous monastery about thirteen miles off,where the monks would entertain us with food. But he warned us of one thing,which was on no account to touch any water.We were both delighted. We started off. It was one of the most wonderful days Ihave seen. We went to the monastery, where the monks gave us bread and soup andshowed us all over it. On the way back the heat was appalling. We were both sothirsty that we did not know what to do. Suddenly we came to a mountain spring,bubbling up out of the ground.It was an awful temptation. I do not think that at that time either of usrealized how important it was not to touch the water. Although the Mystic haddone his best to impress on us the dangers of drinking, the spring looked socool and fresh and pure that Raoul could not resist. He knelt down and drank,but in spite of my thirst I managed to restrain myself, though with greatdifficulty. I suppose I saved my own life. Anyway, I am certain that this is howRaoul caught the disease. He was at once given the right treatment, but noimprovement was effected, and he sank fast.At this juncture I was expelled from the abbey for disobedience to one of theMystic’s most arbitrary and unreasonable commands. Every fortnight I had beenaccustomed to receive the English papers from Raoul’s mother. Then one day,without either warning or explanation, the Mystic forbade me to go to thevillage to fetch them, saying, “In future no papers are to be brought into theabbey, nor must any of the members read them. Disobedience will entailbanishment from the abbey.”Needless to say, I did not submit to his decree, but fetched my papers as usual,and retired after lunch to read them in my own room. I had not been reading longwhen the Mystic strode in, his face twitching with rage. He ordered me to go.There was a terrific scene. I should have said before that there were severalloaded revolvers which used to lie about in the abbey. They were very necessary,for we never knew whether brigands might not attack it. The Mystic used to shootany dogs that came anywhere near the abbey with his revolver. He was anextremely good shot. It so happened that I had found one of these revolverslying about the day before, and it suddenly occurred to me that it would be awise precaution to hide it under my pillow. I now seized it and fired it wildlyat the Mystic. It went wide of the mark. He laughed heartily. Then I rushed athim, but could not get a grip on his shaved head. He picked me up in his armsand flung me bodily outside, through the front door.I was well aware how it would distress Raoul and endanger his slender chances ofrecovery to be parted from me at this time. And yet I knew that no amount ofpersuasion would induce the Mystic to allow me to return. I therefore determinedto write to the British consul at Palermo and appeal for his assistance.I found temporary accommodation in the village, and at once proceeded with mydesign. However, while I was still engaged in writing I was intruded upon by oneof the women of the abbey, who saw what I was doing before I had time to takeany measures of concealment, and immediately reported it to the Mystic, who fromwhat followed must, I think, have been somewhat perturbed by my intention. Forthe next day this same woman brought me a note from Raoul begging me to returneven if I had to climb through the window. I went straight to the abbey, wherethe Mystic greeted me with the ultimatum that I must sign a paper denying thestatements about the abbey that I had made in my letter to the consul. ForRaoul’s sake I complied and was allowed to remain.The next morning Raoul was much worse. The Mystic was visibly alarmed and sentan urgent summons to the doctor. On seeing Raoul, the doctor at once dispatchedme to the village for some special oil which was to be injected by means of ahypodermic syringe. I made all the haste I could, and as a result of my exertioncombined with a natural anxiety, fainted in the shop. When I came to I saw theMystic standing over me. He said kindly, “There, that’s better. You’re all rightnow.”There was a cab waiting outside in which we drove as far towards the abbey asthe track allowed, continuing our journey on foot. It was late in the afternoon,and the setting sun touched the arid rock-strewn hillside with pink. Thensuddenly, just as the sun was about to disappear beneath the horizon, the Mysticstopped, and said,“We will take adoration” (a daily rite in the abbey), and raising his hand hepronounced the customary and to me then beautiful invocation. Before he hadfinished I observed that tears were running down his cheeks, and for hissympathy and love for Raoul I forgave him everything.The invocation done, we went on our way. But before we had gone far a woman fromthe abbey met us. She was distressed.“Is he worse?” I asked fearfully.“He’s dead,” she answered. I fainted again.When I came to I was led into the room where my husband had died. He lay thereon the bed, his arms raised slightly behind the head, while the head wasdrooping forward slightly, in exactly the same position as the spirit form onthe photograph that had been taken on our wedding day. It had been a warning.In Italy a corpse may not remain in the house after sunset. Raoul’s body wasplaced in a coffin, which was then carried to a sort of greenhouse at the sideof the abbey. The coffin lid was removed, and Raoul lay inside looking just asif he were asleep. All night long the Mystic in his robes paced round thecoffin, tapping it with his wand and muttering incantations. I shall neverforget that tapping. For months it echoed in my head. At last morning came.Raoul could not be buried actually inside the cemetery as he was not a Catholic,but a piece of ground was got outside just by the road, along the hillside. Idid not join the service, which was conducted by the Mystic clad in his mostmagnificent vestments, with precious stones gleaming on his hands, with thewomen of the abbey round him, weeping. I watched from a little distance off. Ihave never seen such crowds as those that came to poor Raoul’s burial. Frommiles round peasants came in, for the abbey was known all over Sicily. The sunmade the white domes of the sepulchres sparkle. Away below the cliff the seadashed itself on the stones. The Mystic stood with his magic wand raised. It wasat least such a burial as Raoul himself would have wished for.Three days later money arrived through the consul, and I left for England."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VIIII GO TO AMERICAJacob Kramer—A fox-hunting painter—A mad visit to Yorkshire—Poverty—I appear inthe papers—Princess Waletka—New York—Broadway—An Indian Reservation— Montreal—Ipart with Waletka—I return home—I meet Carol—Marriage again—Life in thecountry—My shop—The Rookery—Carol’s illness—I run away.ON my return to London I put up at the Harlequin Club, in the room I had sharedwith Raoul during the early days of our marriage. At first I felt very lonelyand depressed, but my spirits gradually improved and my melancholy recollectionswere pushed into the background by a chance meeting with an old friend—theJewish painter, Jacob Kramer—whom I had not seen or communicated with for years.The feeling of returning to London after a long absence is one which I findnever palls on me. As soon as my train approaches whichever terminus it happensto be, and I see out of the window the familiar backs of the tenement houses,with their washing and their outside staircases, my memories of wherever I havebeen staying, of the people I have met and the things I have done suddenly seemvery remote, and I am possessed with an incredible eagerness to resume all theactivities and to visit all the places that I have neglected for so long.Directly I get out on to the platform I call a taxi and drive to the FitzroyTavern in Charlotte Street, or to wherever I think I am likely to find some ofmy friends. So I acted on this occasion. I should add, by the way, that there isnowhere quite like the Fitzroy. It seems more of a café than a public house, orat least as like a café as anything I know in England. Its proprietor, Mr.Kleinfeld, and his very charming daughter Annie, are some of the nicest andkindest people I know, and I am sure there are lots of people like me who feelthey could not do without them. It was here that I met Jacob. He has now becomequite famous in his profession. In those days, however, he was as yet littleknown, and in consequence hard up. It is a source of no little satisfaction tome that his present reputation is due in some part to myself, since a portraithe did of me called “The Sphinx” was exhibited among the modern pictures thatwere shown at the Wembley Exhibition, and was greatly admired.This was done for a manufacturer of Bradford, who met me in the Harlequin, andwas so taken with my appearance and personality that he commissioned Jacob topaint me for quite a large sum. He also, very generously, paid me for mysittings.The work was done in my room at the Harlequin, as Jacob was then too poor toafford a studio, and while painting the picture quickly fell in love with me. Itwas here he proposed to me, and we arranged to get married as soon as thepicture was finished and the fee paid. His mother, however, as a practising Jew,refused to allow him to marry a Christian.But, after all, I wonder whether perhaps this was just as well, for I do notthink Jacob was designed for a solid and easy-going husband. As soon as he gotthe money he gave a series of parties at The Yorkshire Grey in Fitzroy Street,which was then the meeting-place of a considerable artistic circle. Here I met aremarkable man, Brooks, the fox-hunting painter, and his wife Pete, who was onceone of Epstein’s most promising pupils, but has done little serious sculpturesince her marriage.About this time my life began to become rather incoherent, and I will tell youthe following incident to show the sort of thing I mean.One day someone casually suggested that we should all go to Yorkshire. Everybodyimmediately fell in with the idea and we set off on the spot, arriving late atGrassington the same night.We remained at Grassington until someone else had another whim. This time to goto Leeds to visit some friends and patrons of art called S——. They wanted me toaccompany them, but I preferred to remain where I was staying. About a fortnightlater, however, we decided to follow our friends.We had arranged to catch the eleven o’clock train, and arrived at the stationwith some ten minutes to spare. But our precaution failed in its effect. To fillin the time, it was suggested that we should have a drink at the pub oppositethe station, and there, incredible as it may sound, we remained until fiveo’clock in the afternoon. One member of the party alleges that I beat him atbilliards.At five o’clock we sent another wire and caught a train to Leeds. We all fellasleep en route. Someone met us at the station, and we all adjourned to thestation bar for another drink to pull us together and prepare us for anencounter with the S——s. Then just as we were leaving the station another of theparty announced his intention of going to London. His wife accompanied him, andthe rest of us went to the S——s’s house alone.We found there Bob S—— (a medical student at Leeds University), Olive his wife(once a model of Augustus John’s. Now a wealthy woman, owing to a previoushusband who had died only a fortnight after the marriage), and, to my delight,my old friend Ralph, with whom I had been through some hard times soon after thewar. He was apparently living in rooms in Leeds and having his meals with theS——s. Olive, since acquiring her money, was an extremely generous benefactressto poor artists, and she had bought a number of pictures both by Ralph and otherfriends of mine.Although it was rather late we had some tea, and afterwards played the guitarand sang a little, until it was time to go out to the S——s’s habitual tavern foran aperitif. Here I could see that Ralph’s old inclination towards me wasbeginning to revive. I found that I had a good deal to say to him, and after abit I realized that we had been quite unconsciously ignoring the others. One ofthem, whom I will call X., was very annoyed. As soon as I turned round he said,image [images/f189-01.jpg]BETTY MAY AT THE FITZROY TAVERN. FROM A DRAWING BY NINA HAMNETT[06_illustrations.xhtml#fig_09]“I’d better go and find you a room.”“Oh, no,” said Olive. “You needn’t bother. Betty can stay with us.”At this X. came up to me, fuming, and began to expostulate, but I pushed him offand whispered to Olive, “For God’s sake keep him away.”She understood, and from that time forward X. was not admitted to their house.“What about some food?” Bob S—— suggested.We agreed with his suggestion and went out, leaving X. alone and furious.I took up my abode with the S——s, and saw Ralph every day at meals. We rapidlygot fond of one another again and took to going for walks together in theafternoons, and he asked me to sit for him. On one of our walks we met X. Hecame up and attempted to join us, but we took no notice of him, and at length,after making some unwarrantable assertions, he went away. That, we thought, wasthe last of him. But we were wrong.One afternoon we had all been out for a motor drive, and Bob and Ralph weregaraging the car while Olive and I went on home. When we turned into our streetthe first thing we saw was X., mad-drunk, with dishevelled hair, attacking theS——s’s front door with a hatchet. We were terrified. I thought our best plan wasto slip in by the back entrance and telephone for the police. Telephoning,however, proved unnecessary, as the police had already arrived. In fact we metthem in the hall—with X.The inspector was stern. Having ascertained Olive’s credentials, he turned tome.“Are you anything to do with this man?” he asked, indicating X.“I was,” I replied, thinking impudence to be the best policy.“Oh, you were,” said the inspector sagely, “were you?”I nodded.“Well,” he went on, “will you see that he leaves Leeds before twelve o’clockto-night? Otherwise I shall have to lock him up.”I agreed that I would.X. was recalcitrant and refused to go unless I promised to accompany him, whichI was at length compelled to do. He would probably have been even less amenablehad he known that I had bought a return ticket for myself. When we got to LondonI gave X. the slip while he was buying a paper and returned straight to Leeds,where Ralph was awaiting me on the platform.In course of time Ralph became bored with Leeds and had an idea that he wouldlike to do some landscapes, and asked if we would accompany him.We went to a delightful village called Horton, near Ribblesdale, where we foundan equally pleasant inn to put up at. Every day we used to go out painting,taking our lunch with us, and in the evening we conversed with the rustics overale. I was very happy. But after about three months I began to long for London.Ralph asked me why I wanted to go.“Oh, I’m just fed up,” I said.“With us?”“No. With the country. I feel I must go back to London. That’s all.”Somewhat reluctantly they allowed me to go. And so I found myself back in Londononce more.I now found myself in very low water. For some reason there seemed to be verylittle opportunity for getting sittings, and I could not get a job anywheredancing or anything like that.I was miserably poor. I lived in a tiny attic in Soho, for which I paid twelveshillings and sixpence a week. I had only one dress, which I used to wash myselfand put on wet. Often I had nothing to eat all day. I was pretty well finishedwhen a press photographer called and asked me to give him a sitting. Here atlast, I thought, was a possibility of making a guinea or so. But the eventexceeded my hopes. For one evening while I was sitting in the “Plough,” near theBritish Museum, I was introduced to a journalist who suggested that mylife-story would be of interest to his paper. We talked together for a longtime, and I told him all about some of the exciting portions of my life inLimehouse and Paris and Sicily. He was very interested in the story. I told himthat if he wanted to get hold of me he had better ring up the “Crown” in BrewerStreet between six and seven. The proprietors of the “Crown” were, at this time,Mr. and Mrs. Morris and their daughter, all of whom were very kind to me at thisperiod when I was poor. I shall always be very grateful to them for this. Idon’t forget that sort of thing.image [images/f193-01.jpg]BETTY MAY. FROM A DRAWING BY GERALD REITLINGER [06_illustrations.xhtml#fig_10]Three weeks later he rang up and asked me to dine with him, adding that he hadsome good news for me. I went to the meeting-place in a state of greatexcitement. He was waiting for me.“Oh,” I exclaimed, without any other greeting, “what is the news? Tell mequickly.”He had not deluded me. The news was that a Sunday paper had offered to pay £500for some articles describing some of my adventures.I was thrilled. The publicity ! To see my name in the headlines every week! Toimpress my personality on the public—and they would be impressed, I felt sure,for no one has had such a life as mine. And then there was the money. I couldhardly restrain myself from shouting aloud and throwing my arms around his neckthere and then.“How too marvellous!” I said. “Bernard, you are a dear.”And so it was settled.“Now,” I announced, “we must celebrate. I want a wonderful dinner. Let’s go tothe Café Royal.”I had not been there for months, and I was welcomed by the waiters as I had beenlong ago on my return from Paris. Bernard was infected with my excitement. Wedrank good luck to the life-story in large quantities of the best champagne, andafter that we had some of the choicest brandy the Café Royal could produce.I removed from my Soho lodging, and took a nice flat. Here I led a verytolerable life. Every day I used to go down to lunch in Fleet Street, where Igot to know a number of the leading journalists. In Bernard’s own office I was agreat favourite from the beginning, and I increased my popularity by making teafor the staff in the afternoon.One day on Bernard’s table I saw a photograph of a remarkable looking woman, andfrom that moment determined to make her acquaintance. I asked Bernard who shewas, but could only get out of him that she was a clairvoyant of sorts, aboutwhom he was writing an article, and when I requested him to take me to see her,he replied vaguely that she was very difficult to approach. I was not to be putoff, however.“I desire to meet her,” I said. “And what is more, I will meet her. Will youtake me?”He rather unwillingly consented, probably believing that I should forget allabout her in a few davs’ time. But he was wrong. I had definitely made up mymind that I was going to meet her and refused to be satisfied until I had doneso. I pestered him daily until at last he announced that he had persuaded her tocome to tea at the Waldorf Hotel.I almost trembled with excitement as we awaited her arrival. I felt that themeeting would be somehow momentous, that it would vitally affect my life. I keptmy eyes fixed on the revolving doors through which we had come in, but everyonewent straight to a table. None paused to look round in search of us. At lastBernard stood up and gesticulated to someone who had entered by another door. Ieagerly looked in the same direction, and saw approaching us a gaunt, swarthywoman of Red Indian type, with large intense eyes, long plaits of black hair andmoccasins. With her was a little boy of about seven, and her husband.Without being introduced, she said to me,“You are Betty May. You have been married three times and your last husband, whowas younger than you, died of fever. Is not that so?” She spoke slowly in a deepvoice, with a peculiar rhythmic intonation that was both impressive andcompelling.“You are a twin soul of mine,” she went on, without waiting for an answer to herquestion. “Our destinies are interwoven. When I die you will die too.”All this time her deep hypnotic eyes stared into mine, and I felt as if all mypersonality, every scrap of vitality, was being drawn out of me by that gaze. Ifshe moved, I moved. For the time being at any rate, I was not even a twin soul.I was the same soul. My centre was in her.“You will come with me to America,” she said, and I knew that I could not dootherwise.The next day I left the flat and went to live in the household of this strangewoman, who was known as the Princess Waletka.Not long after I joined her we set out on a provincial tour. Waletka waseverywhere successful, as indeed she deserved to be, since her thought-readingmethods baffled even Houdini. However, when we were in a certain important townin South Wales, her popularity was the cause of an incident which reminded methat the publicity derived from the weekly instalments of my life-story (theyhad now been running for some time) was not without its disadvantages. Some veryrich people who were well known in the neighbourhood gave a luncheon inWaletka’s honour, which I also attended. We had just sat down and started ourhors-d’oeuvres when our hostess asked me, “Your name is Betty May, isn’t it?”“Yes,” I answered.“May I ask,” she went on, “if you are the Betty May whose life has beenappearing in the ——?”Again I replied that I was indeed.“In that case,” she said, “I must ask you to leave my house immediately.”Amazed, I rose from my place and went out. Waletka followed me, saying, “If myfriend goes, I go.”Not long after this we sailed to America.How shall I give my impressions of America ?I hardly know. The absolutely equal vividness of my experiences, and therapidity with which they succeeded one another, prevented me from retaining anydistinct or orderly recollections of them. I was in America for three months.But I find it impossible to say, “This happened at such and such a time, andthat just before, and that just after.” Those three months dwell in my mind asone single, though composite experience. I remember them as one remembers aparticular evening, after a certain interval has elapsed. Let me, however, tryto disentangle some of the more important facts about that memory.The first is the overwhelming hospitality of the Americans. We stayed most ofthe time in New York, and were never away for more than a few days together.Nevertheless we always had more offers of entertainment than we could possiblyavail ourselves of.I had an opportunity of seeing something of American home life, which is sodifferent from ours, when I stayed with the charming Mr. and Mrs. Morris intheir country house. As you know, he is probably the biggest theatrical producerin America, and he and his wife were extremely kind to us.Our acquaintance was very largely theatrical. Indeed the atmosphere of thetheatre pervades my entire recollection of America. One of the things that I doremember very vividly is Broadway. What a wonderful street it is when lighted upat night. Even all I had heard and read about it did not prepare me for what itwas really like. Nearly every night Waletka gave a performance either in NewYork or its environs, and as I try now to picture myself at that time I seem tosee a succession of dressing-rooms, all of them bare, dusty, draughty andsmelling of grease-paint. All furnished with the same mirrors and hand-basins(the water usually cold) and make-up tables. All of them littered with costumesand properties which, it seemed to me, could never be got back again into theirtrunks. Soon I felt at home in any dressing-room. I became used to sitting therewith Waletka’s little boy, Neil, all the time his mother was on the stage. Iknew every cue by heart and at any point could tell to a second how much longerthe performance was going on for. In a week I felt as if I had been connectedwith the stage all my life.After the theatre we often went to the most sumptuous supper parties. And if wehad a few days free of engagements we used to go for delightful automobile tripsto Saranac Lake or the Adirondack Hills. There is a sanatorium for consumptivesat Saranac, the air being considered particularly beneficial to people soafflicted, on account of the abundance of pine trees. This, I think, was thereason why we went there so often, for both Waletka and her daughter sufferedfrom consumption.There was a mayoral election in progress during my visit, and Waletka and manyof the theatrical celebrities of New York combined to give a charity concert onbehalf of the republican candidate. The place chosen for the performance was alittle town called Glens Falls, on the Canadian border, where intoxicatingliquor could be bought and consumed—though only after complying with a multitudeof vexatious and pointless formalities. After the concert a public banquet wasprovided for the performers, at which I had my first drink since landing inAmerica. And how I appreciated it ! Everybody around me seemed also to be takingadvantage of the greater indulgence of the British law, and in no half-heartedfashion. I felt almost as if I were at home again, at a party in the Café Royal.I was in my element. I would show these people how to revel. For good drinkersas they were, they had not known such parties as I had, in the old days ofBillie Carleton. They had not known the Crabtree and the Cabaret Club and theEndell Street Club ! My mind went back to my earliest times in London, to thewonderful pre-war London, in comparison with which the present seems so insipid.I wondered vaguely if I should ever go back, or if I should spend the rest of mylife here in America.My reverie was interrupted by a chorus of voices shouting my name. It was myturn to entertain the company with a song. I sang “The Raggle-TaggleGipsies”—one of the songs I used to sing to Epstein while he was modelling hisbust of me—and it was received with demonstrations of enthusiastic appreciation.Strongly contrasted with the gay parties at Glens Falls was my visit to theIndian reservation of Coughnawaga. Here we found a way of life grave, primitive,monotonous—the absolute opposite to the restless “gogetting” of Wall Street andFifth Avenue. We were the guests of the chief, and stayed in his hut. He was, bythe way, the father of the chief figure in the famous Stillman case of a fewyears ago. He showed us a number of interesting things, including the Indianmethod of making bread and “Pemmican,” pounded in a way of which they only knowthe secret. It is useful for long expeditions, when the weight and bulk of foodcarried has to be reduced to a minimum. He also showed us the “huskies,” orwolf-crossed sleigh dogs, that snarled and snapped from their cages all daylong. His wife, too, was very kind to us. As a matter of fact the Indians ratherdisappointed me, as they wore quite ordinary European clothes, and as a resultlooked rather uninteresting and not at all picturesque.From here we went to Montreal, a beautiful town, and a great contrast to NewYork. For Montreal retains the tranquillity which I believe, though I have nevervisited them, still characterizes the towns of the old slave-owning states ofthe South. At any rate I found it restful after the gaiety and clatter ofBroadway.I think now that my homesickness really began in Montreal, though I was notconscious of it at the time. We returned to New York to fulfil a number ofengagements, both social and professional, and I took part in them with anapparently undiminished zest. But I can see now that my energy was flagging. Iwas indulging in a feverish activity to disguise my dissatisfaction from myself,and to repress any timid homesickness that had I stopped to reflect might makeitself heard. One day, however, among the Adirondack Hills, my sleeping desireto see England again awakened, and would not be put off or evaded, and I said toWaletka,“I must go home.”She was sorry, because of her affection for me, and because she had hoped that Imight, with training, have been able to assist her in her profession, but withtrue insight she made no effort to dissuade me from my intention. And so I wentback to New York for the last time. Waletka bought me some beautiful dresses asa parting present. She paid my fare and gave me a hundred pounds. She came onboard the ship with me so as to postpone saying good-bye until the last possiblemoment. I remember how moved she was, but little else of the journey, as mythoughts were already directed towards England.I then took up my life again at the point where I had broken it off to go toAmerica.Three days after landing in England I happened to go into the “Crown “in BrewerStreet, where I met my old friend Jacob. He was delighted to see me, and wespent a very talkative five minutes relating what each of us had been doing inthe time that had passed since last we met. Then Jacob said he must go, as hehad an appointment. (It is a peculiarity of Jacob’s that he has moreappointments per day than any man I know.) “I won’t be long,” he said. “I’m justgoing to meet a man. I’ll try and bring him back here. Will you wait?”About half an hour later he returned with a youth whom he introduced to me asCarol, the assistant editor of a well-known sporting paper. Carol was apositive, assertive sort of person, not to say opinionated, as he showed by hisfirst remark to me, “I wish you’d take some of the rouge off your lips. I thinkit looks horrible. And I detest polished nails.”Nevertheless, before closing time he had given me as a present a national flagof Wales, and obtained permission to ring me up.A few days later the telephone bell rang in our flat, and when I answered it anunfamiliar voice asked, “Is that Miss Betty May?”“Yes,” I replied. “Who’s that?”“Carol,” the voice said. I have a bad memory for names and inquired who he was,anyway.“I gave you a Welsh flag a few days ago,” he said. “Will you dine with meto-night?”I accepted his invitation and turned up wearing the flag as a headdress, adelicate compliment, I thought, to the donor. Carol, however, was not pleased.He was as particular, I discovered, about women’s attire as Raoul had been abouthis own. A woman, in his eyes, must above all things be correctly dressed, or,as he used to express it, “Well turned out.” Nevertheless, we continued to lunchand dine together almost every day.You will by now probably have guessed where this was going to lead. And if youhave done so you have also probably guessed right. After a short time it wasagreed that we should get married. I suppose that in a way it was silly of me toagree to it, but, after all, you cannot really help falling in love when itcomes to the point. Carol liked hunting and shooting and fishing, and I do notreally care for that sort of thing, as I have already tried to explain. I knewit would mean living in the country again, but the days when I had done thisbefore seemed so far off that I had almost forgotten how much I had disliked it.And, anyway, I do not think about that sort of thing much when I suddenly findthat I am fond of someone. So we got engaged and once more I began makingarrangements and plans for another marriage.Carol, meanwhile, had acquainted his mother with his intention of gettingmarried. She was not pleased. And her misgivings were increased by frequentcalls of condolence from the neighbours, among whom Carol had spread the rumourthat I was a fat negress with five children.I left my flat immediately and moved into a room procured for me by Carol. Thelandlady was an Italian and a very pleasant woman. But after a while she raiseda very curious objection. Carol had given her to understand that I was his wife.He was in the habit of leaving notes for me, if by any chance I was out in themiddle of the day when he called. The landlady one day, to my great surprise,asked for my rent and said she could no longer have me in her house, on theground that husbands did not as a rule continually leave notes for their wives!“But,” she added, “I am sure my sister would be very glad to have you.”If was at the sister’s house that the first great scene with my mother-in-lawtook place.Soon after it had become understood that we were to be married, Carol thought itwould be advisable for me to meet his mother and make as good an impression onher as I could. We also decided, in view of his mother’s character, that itwould be advisable to pretend that we were already married, and so to compel herto acknowledge as a fact what she would never have consented to. We accordinglywent down to the country the following week-end.Carol’s mother was one of those cold, drooping ladies who seem to live morebecause “one must” than for any other reason. Her only hold on life was herfierce love for her son, which appeared almost a mania. She was obviouslyhostile to myself from the start, though I must say she was too much of a ladynot to try her level best to hide from me what she felt. I supposed I was one ofthe things that “did happen.”It was not a comfortable week-end. Poor Carol—I felt very sorry for him—triedrather uneasily to get some understanding between his mother and myself, but forall his efforts he was unable to find a single topic of conversation interestingto us both. In the end he gave up the attempt and confined himself to talkingnow to one and now to the other, on subjects, and even in a language, which wereof their nature absolutely unintelligible to the third person. When his motherand I were alone she kept up the conventions by telling me about her relations.On Monday morning when the maid awakened me with my tea, I murmured to myselfwith heart-felt sincerity, “Well, thank goodness that’s over.” The ordeal wasover, and, I flattered myself, not too disastrously. Our visit might have beenput down even as a great success had it not been for Carol. I cannot think whatpossessed him to say it, and can only think that it was the same impish humourthat made him spread the rumour that I was a black woman. At all events, andwhatever the explanation, he said casually to his mother just as we were gettinginto the car to go to the station,“Oh, by the way, mother, we aren’t married, of course.”Her reaction to this news may be guessed.Carol and I went to a party that night and did not arrive home until some timeafter three o’clock a.m. At six the landlady came in and told us that a lady hadbeen to the house the previous afternoon, inquiring for me.“What a good thing I was out,” I said.“She said she was coming back early this morning,” the landlady added.We had a terrible scene when she did arrive. Carol was also there by that time.She abused me and entreated me. She called me a wicked woman. She wept andbegged me on her knees to give her back her son. It was impossible to stop her,and Carol and I looked on helplessly. Every now and then he touched her shoulderand said nervously, “Mother, do stop.”At length she could continue no longer. She dabbed her eyes and nose andrearranged her hat in front of the mirror.“You will get married, won’t you?” she gasped as she departed, buttoning hergloves.After the wedding Carol took me down to his home, where it was decided we shouldlive for the time being. We arrived in time for tea, which his mother pouredout, remarking to me as she did so,“I’m not sure that you oughtn’t to be pouring out instead of me now.”When we had finished Carol said he must go and have a look at a part of theriver he was baiting for the weekend. I immediately offered to accompany him. Toget to the river we had to cross several fields, in the corner of one of whichwas a large rookery. Carol looked up, as we passed, at the birds, and said,“I really must come out one day and shoot some of them. There are far too many.I’ve been meaning to for a long time. But what with getting married and onething and another . . .”At this moment I stepped into a concealed rut and fell over, twisting my ankleslightly and losing, as on another previous occasion, one of my shoes.Carol picked me up and asked if I had hurt myself.“No,” I replied, “but my feet are horribly wet, and I’ve ruined this coat.”“Yes,” he agreed, “you are in a bit of a mess.”And added, as an afterthought, “By the way, you’ll have to get some rather moresuitable kit for shooting and so forth.”We met a lot of farmers and yokels on the way. Carol knew them all and askednearly every one of them some such question as, “Have you seen any more of thatcovey we put up on so-and-so’s the other day?” or “Has old so-and-so lost anymore chickens?”The fish were apparently satisfactory, since Carol merely looked at the waterand did nothing further about them. Personally I thought the whole expeditionseemed a little pointless.On the way home we went into the “Bull,” the chief public house of the village,and about a mile from our house, for a drink. Carol introduced me to thelandlord, who was very amused at my not being black, and frankly doubtful aboutmy reputed five children. However, having expressed his views he had nothingfurther to say to me, and proceeded to the more important business of informingCarol of the sporting and agricultural news of the neighbourhood.“Will you be in here to-night?” he asked Carol as we were leaving. “I expect Mr.—— will look in.”“Yes,” said Carol, “ I want to see him.”Carol was, by profession, a sporting journalist, and he used to visit the“Bull,” as this tavern was called, in order to find out if any surprising fishhad been caught, what the prospects of the pheasant season were, or what therecent bags of partridges had been, and so forth. The “Bull” was the home of allthe sporting as well as agricultural and purely personal news of theneighbourhood, and it was on this account he had to spend his evenings there.Nevertheless, his absence was no less irksome to me than if it had beenpleasure, not duty, that called him away. For the result was that I had to spendthe time between dinner and bed in the sole company of his mother, with whom,for all her excellent qualities, I was unable to converse with any ease. Sostrained were our relations that I was very soon driven to jigsaw puzzles as theonly means of filling in a decent interval before retiring for the night. Theknowledge that we were now legally mother and daughter did not seem to havebrought Carol’s mother and myself any nearer together. It was distressing buttrue. However, I do not think that either of us realized at the time the truehorror of it. As even if we admitted to ourselves that there could never be anysympathy between us, even if our hope be taken away, even so we neither of ushad the slightest idea on that evening of the nerve-strain, the silence and hatethat were to envelop us during the winter evenings that were to come.After dinner Carol went out. We went into the drawing-room. She took some sewingfrom a workbasket. The maid brought in coffee.“Do you like a lot of sugar?” she inquired as the maid was going out.After the door shut we relapsed again into silence.I could hear her breathing.At length she felt that it was her duty to say something. Folding up herneedlework, she addressed herself to me on the only topic the least interestingto us both—Carol. She told me what a good son he had always been to her— thoughthere had been trying periods. She recounted stories of his infantile pranks.She even told me, in an expansion of confidence and a lowered voice, of hisfirst love-affair. From the love-affair we passed to her habitual standby, orconversational stockpot, as it were—the family. Oh, those relations of hers!They haunted me like goblins. I knew all their faces even better than I knewthose of my husband and my mother-in-law herself. The whole house was inhabitedby them. Gradually I got by heart every detail of their dreary lives. After Ihad been a month married, I could have got 100 per cent. in an examination onthe family history, including every younger branch, to the third and fourthgenerations at least.I said I was so tired as a result of my journey that I got to bed at last by thetime Carol returned from the “Bull.” The next morning he went, as usual, toLondon, only returning in time for dinner, and going out again to the “Bull”afterwards.On Saturdays he remained at home, and if it were the right season I wouldaccompany him on shooting or fishing expeditions, in neither of which could Ibring myself to take a great deal of interest, although he instructed mediligently in the theory and practice of both.On Sundays we attended church, and ate a heavier lunch than on week-days.As time went on my mother-in-law began to forget her hostility. She gotaccustomed to seeing me about, and liked, I suppose, the presence of someone onwhom to unload her thoughts. At any rate, whatever the reason, she grew morepersistent in her companionship, even following me to my bed (whither I used toretire each night at nine o’clock with a novel), and there repeating and goingover all she had said during the day.This affability, however, had, I am afraid, no softening effect upon mydisposition towards her. It repulsed rather than attracted me, and further addedto the touchy condition of my nerves. A climax was inevitable. This is how ithappened. I had stayed in bed for breakfast as I felt slightly unwell, askingCarol to have a pot of tea and some toast sent up to me. Instead of the maid, mymother-in-law herself (very kindly) brought me what I had asked for.Unfortunately I was not in a mood to appreciate her good intentions. Couldn’tshe, I asked myself, even let me be ill in peace?“Here’s your breakfast, dear,” she said, to call my attention from the EdgarWallace I was engaged on.“Thanks,” I said rudely, without looking up.But she did not take the hint.“How are you feeling, dear?” she inquired with exasperating forbearance.“Awful !”image [images/f211-01.jpg]BETTY MAY. FROM A DRAWING BY MICHAEL SEVIER [06_illustrations.xhtml#fig_11]“Drink a little tea then,” she advised. She poured out a cupful and handed it tome.At this my self-control, which, as you have seen, never is very strong,completely gave way. Seizing the proffered cup, I shouted: “For God’s sake,woman, leave me alone,” and flung the tea in her face, dropping the cup, whichsmashed into small pieces on the floor.“Oh, my beautiful cup !” she wailed, and took to weeping.I was in such a state that it was with the greatest difficulty that I refrainedfrom slapping her face. I leapt out of bed, and in spite of my illness, dressed,rushed out of the house, and took the first train to London. During the wholejourney I was so angry as to be practically unable to think. All I could do wasto picture to myself what she would have looked like had I yielded to my desireto assault her. I almost felt the smack of my fingers on her cheek. However,there was nothing to be done about it now, except to ring up Carol and dischargethe remainder of my anger on him.My mother-in-law, meanwhile, had wired to Carol that I had run away, andconsequently I found him in a great state of alarm.“Where are you?” he asked impatiently, as soon as he heard my voice.“At a public call office.”“Well, come down to the ‘Cheshire Cheese’ at once.” With that he rang off.I hurried to Fleet Street as fast as I could, and found him awaiting me. BeforeI could step inside the bar he jumped up, caught me by my arm, and dragged meaway with such force that he sent an American girl reeling from the threshold ofDr. Johnson’s dining-room into a waiter with a tray full of empty tankards,upsetting the lot. He had a taxi waiting outside, into which I was bundled. Thedriver was directed to take us to Paddington.Carol was extremely agitated.“As you can’t be trusted to stay at home while I’m away,” he announced, “I shallgive up going to London. I resigned my job in the office directly I got mother’swire.”He kept his promise. From that day forward he never left the village, and hardlyever the house, without me. In some ways this made life more tolerable, for Istill liked him. But it entailed the disadvantage of a much heavier programme ofsport. Every day now, bar Sundays, instead of, as before, Saturdays only, wasdevoted to this. Even the close seasons brought little relief, as there werealways rabbits and rooks.The situation between my mother-in-law and myself was temporarily eased by therecent storm, but it was safe to guess that if the same sort of thing happenedagain I should probably behave in the same way. It was with the idea ofpreventing such a scene happening again that an arrangement was made wherebyCarol and I should furnish and live quite independently in a bungalow adjoiningthe house. Carol most fortunately came by some money at about this time, which Ispent lavishly on curtains, carpets, chair covers, rugs, lampshades, tablecloths and other household articles, both useful and decorative. I enjoyedmyself enormously and purchased with zest. And when the buying was done I workedlike a Trojan, sewing curtains, experimenting with different arrangements offurniture, and even whitewashing and distempering. At length I had prepared astrim a little love-nest as can be imagined. It only remained for us to livethere.At first everything went as smoothly as a honeymoon. I enjoyed being able tocook once more, and made Carol such exquisite little dinners as I had once madefor Raoul. He was very appreciative of my efforts. Sometimes we wouldcollaborate in the invention of new dishes.But alas! The pleasures of housekeeping grew stale as fast as the otherpleasures of this provoking world. After about a fortnight of Darby-and-Joan inthe bungalow I fled back to the house, eager to taste a meal that I had notsupervised at every stage.And after another fortnight of conversation about the family history I fled asquickly back to the bungalow. And so on.Then I hit upon what seemed to me an admirable plan for avoiding both the familyhistory and excessive sport. We possessed a large tent in which we wereaccustomed to spend a certain portion of each summer if the weather permitted. Ierected this and fitted it out as a cake and sweet shop, which I ransingle-handed, even to the making of all the confections sold in it. It was hardwork. But in spite of my previously confessed lack of business qualities, I madea success of it. As in my dressing and in my ordinary cooking, I had no greatrespect for tradition or convention, and my recipes were things I inventedmyself, and not things I had read about.Every day I would make some new experiment. At first the neighbourhood was alittle distrustful of my wares. Gradually, however, and a littleself-consciously— they felt it was odd that Carol’s wife should engage in retailtrade—they took to patronizing my shop, and once they had overcome their cautionand their shyness they invariably became regular customers. “Miss Betty’s” cakesand sweets were the admiration of the village.Only at home my shop was disregarded, and practically never mentioned. Carol,satisfied that I had not run away, was completely taken up with his own pursuits(he still wrote a good many sporting articles and was a correspondent for thedistrict to several papers). My mother-in-law, though she had not openlyprotested, had disapproved from the first. Nevertheless, I persevered, glad insome ways to have a sphere in which I was entirely independent. But in time, aswith the bungalow, the drudgery became more noticeable than the pleasure. To getup on a cold morning, when it mattered to nobody except myself whether I stayedin bed or not, seemed rather pointless. If only Carol had shown the slightestinterest, if he had casually said, “I think your shop’s an excellent thing,Betty, I should keep on with it,” I should have gladly taken his advice. But ashis attitude—I forget the exact words—was one of “Please yourself,” I stayed inbed, gave up the shop, and was more bored than ever.By way of amusing myself, I returned for the third time to the bungalow. But Ifound it no more satisfactory than on previous occasions. I felt as if we wereplaying at independence, like children. And when, as soon happened, the gamegrew tedious, there was nothing left for me but surrender.In the following of this new policy I listened with close attention to myhusband’s instructions and stories about sport, and tried to put them intopractice, if not with much success, at least with a good deal of enthusiasm.One afternoon Carol said, “The rookery is really getting hopelesslyover-populated. I think we’ll go and shoot some to-day. I’ve been meaning to fora long time.”“Ever since I came here.”“Oh, no, much longer than that.”He went to fetch his gun. I felt a little depressed. Could I keep this up forever ? I wondered. Could I be content to give up my own life, without even thereward of being assured that my sacrifice was appreciated ? Could I adapt myselfabsolutely to his ways, if he made no effort to respond to my desire to be lovedand to be told so? It seemed a long time since that first walk when he hadmentioned the rooks to me, but the reaches of time before us seemed even longer.Carol returned, wiping the oil from his rifle with a rag.“Have you got the sandwiches?” he asked.We set out. It was a wonderful autumn morning. The rookery was in a thin belt oftrees on the top of a ridge, and the sun, which rose from the earth, glowedthrough the mist.Carol, in a brown shooting coat and a tweed hat stuck with trout flies, acigarette in his mouth and his gun under his arm, looked utterly in keeping withthe scene.The noise, as we approached the wood, grew deafening. When at length we gotamong the trees I felt as if I were beneath a black canopy, that creaked in theslight wind. Then Carol started to shoot. The great birds rained down. I wasterrified in case one should fall on me. They flapped about our feet. Carolinstructed me to break the necks of those that still struggled. I can hardlydescribe the repulsion that I felt at the idea of touching them. Nevertheless, Idid as he said, though it nearly made me sick. For hours I was engaged on thisdisgusting task. Dusk fell while I was still doing it.We gathered our spoil and walked heavily home. I felt tired and unhappy, and wasoppressed with a sensation of foreboding. For the last three nights a screechowl had settled on our house, and the villagers all said it was an omen ofdeath. Upon entering the home meadow we heard a cry.A week after the slaughter of the rooks Carol was taken ill with some form ofinternal poisoning. The symptoms were a high temperature and continuousvomiting. I was convinced that the rook pie, which I had firmly refused to eat,was the cause.When after several days had elapsed and he showed no signs of improvement, webegan to feel extremely anxious about him. (I could not forget the screech owl.)His mother broke down completely. She did nothing beyond sitting about the housewith red eyes and a swollen face, and refusing to eat. The business of nursingfell entirely upon me, and I am bound to admit that in some ways I was notungrateful for having something to do.Carol’s illness was a serious one, and likely to be prolonged. Our bedroom wasfitted out as a sick room. We had a nurse in to be with him at night, thedoctor’s visits became part of our routine, and one had a feeling that theillness had already lasted a very long time.My mother-in-law grew more nervous every day, until the doctor was almost asanxious about her as about Carol. She ate hardly anything, and never slept,often wandering about the house at all hours of the night in a dressing-gown,and creeping into the sick room, much to the irritation of the nurse, who, atlength, complained to the doctor. Her behaviour towards me made things verydifficult. When the doctor, on the nurse’s complaint, requested her to cease hernightly visitations, and in the interests of her own health to rest if she couldnot sleep, she declared that he was in league with me to keep her away from herown son.From that time onwards she took such a dislike to me that my nerves began togive way.She always used to be present when Carol took his meals—beef-tea, bread andmilk, etc., cooked by me. It so happened one morning that, immediately afterconsuming his breakfast, he vomited profusely. I was about to repair themisfortune when I felt my wrist seized by a cold hand.“Oh, you foul, wicked woman,” his mother accused me in a dry, throaty whisper,“you’re killing my son.” I felt that this was the last straw. On an earlieroccasion I had refrained from attacking her with violence. This time I was toostrung up to be influenced by any such scruples, and I did.Leaving her there crying, I went straight to my own room for my hat and coat andsuch luggage as I could carry. On coming out again, prepared for departure, Iwas horrified to see Carol at the top of the stairs in his pyjamas, holding ashot-gun.I put down my suit-case.Carol was swaying as if he were drunk. I dashed up to him just in time to savehim from falling down the stairs. He was practically fainting. I led him back tobed.“Now you mustn’t be silly, Carol,” I coaxed, stroking his forehead. “You promiseyou won’t get out of bed while I go for the doctor.”He moved his head in assent, being incapable of speech, or so I thought until hecroaked out between his gasps,“I will, if you promise not to run away.”“Of course not, darling,” I replied, although that was precisely what I intendedto do.An hour later I was once more in the train for London."},{"pageContent":"CONCLUSIONAND so now I have come to the end of my story. I suppose that at this point Ishould say something about the way I look at life, and give some good advice toothers who may be about to embark on a similar career of adventure. Perhaps Iought to, but I certainly shall not do so. For one thing, I look upon my life asonly just beginning. I am still young. I have my looks and my energy. The futureholds all sorts of things in store for me, probably just as extraordinary asthings that have happened to me already.After all, when I used to wander about the East End of London as a child, it didnot look as if I should get to know the underworld of Paris, sit for famousartists, be bored in English villages, watch magical rites in Sicily, or reallydo any of the things that have made up my life, and so I feel completelyuncertain about the future.My feeling about my life is in many ways one of great dissatisfaction. In spiteof my adventures I do not really think that in many things I have got the bestout of it, and yet when I look back on it I find it equally difficult to imaginemyself behaving in any way differently when I remember the various problems withwhich I have been faced. In fact I believe enormously in the overpoweringinfluence of Fate, which seems to haunt me equally in good or bad fortune.Against this hidden but all-powerful influence it seems to me impossible andfoolish to rebel. It has brought me joy and it has brought me sadness. No doubtit will bring me both again, but I am sure that I am born for adventure, and inthe future I shall be able to face these things as I have faced them in thepast.Sometimes I think I will leave England for a long period. It has crossed my mindto make my way to Africa—to Abyssinia, and again, I sometimes decide that I willgo to Spain. At present I cannot make up my mind, and for once the way does notseem as clear to me as it has often done in the past. But this will not be forlong. The uncertainty will not last—soon I shall decide. Perhaps I shalldisappear for months—for years. But one of these days you will certainly hear ofme again, and perhaps read of the further adventures of Betty May."}]
