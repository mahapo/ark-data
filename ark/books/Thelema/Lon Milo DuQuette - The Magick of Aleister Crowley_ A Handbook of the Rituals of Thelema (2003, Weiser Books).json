He frequently asked hisyounger colleagues to help make his teachings more accessible, and onceexplained that “it's the sort of thing I can't do myself, not knowing the scopeof the mind of the ‘gentle reader.’”Like other “gentle readers” who have delved into Crowley's system on their own,Brother DuQuette found many of the gaps and pitfalls in the system by thetime-honored method of falling into them, scrambling out, and trying again untilhe crossed them. The present work incorporates many of the results of hispersonal work.What is true of science holds true for scientific illuminism. DuQuette is thefirst to allow that while some of his findings may be replicated by futureexperimenters, others are subjective personal interpretation. But even thelatter are invaluable as suggesting other lines of investigation, and asexamples of the kind of personalization of the system that enables the magicianto make it his or her own.DuQuette also drew on recent research by other students that will be formallypublished in the forthcoming one-volume edition of Crowley's Book Four. Speakingof Lon Milo DuQuette's mythical eponym, Crowley wrote in Part II of his BookFour that “Milo began by carrying a newborn calf; and day by day as it grew intoa bull, his strength was found sufficient.” It is not stretching the metaphortoo far to suggest that the present work will be useful to many students as anintroductory guide to those portions of Crowley's magnum opus dealing withceremonial magick.Occultism frequently gives ample grounds for criticism to its detractors bymaking insupportable claims for vaguely defined powers, the whole compassed bynonsensical theory. As Israel Regardie did before him, DuQuette avoids this bywriting from his own experience, with a healthy leavening of common sense and arefreshing sense of humor.Love is the law, love under will.—Hymenaeus BetaFrater Superior, O.T.O."},{"pageContent":"images [../images/00006.jpeg]ACKNOWLEDGMENTSI wish first to thank Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior of Ordo Templi Orientis,for allowing me access to the Order's archival material and for his fraternalencouragement, counsel, and criticism.My thanks also go to Soror Meral, of the College of Thelema, Christopher S.Hyatt, of the Israel Regardie Foundation, James Wasserman, Clive Harper, FraterE.

That sounds suspiciously like a book that was first published in1993 called The Magick of Thelema: A Handbook of the Rituals of AleisterCrowley.You're right! But is it the same book?Well…yes and no.“Yes,” because all the material (sans a few typographical errors) found in TheMagick of Thelema is included in this book.“No,” because the present work has been enlarged and updated with new material(including this introduction, a chapter featuring Frequently Asked Questionsabout Aleister Crowley, and a chapter on Crowley's Rites of Eleusis).Perhaps the most important change is the title itself. The Magick of AleisterCrowley I believe more accurately conveys the essence of what lies between thecovers, and, while it is true that you can't judge a book by its cover, it isalso true that you won't read a book if you don't understand the cover. I mustsadly report that for the past ten years the first thing I most often hear whenI hand someone a copy of The Magick of Thelema is something like “The Magick ofThelma? Who's Thelma?” By the time I explain to them that it's not Thelma, it'sThelema, which is a Greek word for “will,” and then attempt to explain aboutsuch things as the evolution of magical formulae and a philosophy that puts theindividual at the center of the universe, their eyes glaze over completely.The name Aleister Crowley, on the other hand, provokes a far more animatedresponse:“My god! Wasn't he some kind of devil worshiper?” or “Into the dark side arewe?”It seems that everybody who has ever heard the name Aleister Crowley has aninstant (and often very negative) opinion of the man. Nevertheless, nearlyeveryone is intrigued and wants to hear a little more. It's likely that at thisvery moment you are reading these words not because of your burning desire toknow more about Thelema but because you want to know more about Aleister Crowleyand his works.That's not surprising. Crowley is far more famous today than he ever was duringhis lifetime. While he lived, he was lionized by a tiny group of students andsupporters—an odd mix of free-thinking, spiritual bohemians and eccentricintelligentsia. His public reputation was molded almost entirely by a vilifyingstring of tabloid articles filled with half-truths, distortions, and downrightlies concerning his philosophy and activities. At the time of his death in 1947his serious disciples had dwindled to near extinction, and with them the lifeand works of this remarkable man seemed doomed to oblivion.For exactly twenty years Crowley would, for all intents and purposes, lie indead obscurity. Then, a miracle of Dionysian scale occurred. He was quiteliterally raised from the dead by the most famous living entity on theplanet…the Beatles!It Was Twenty Years Ago TodaySgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band was arguably the most anticipated piece ofmusical art in human history, and its magnificently colorful album jacket wasfor a time one of the most recognizable works of modern visual art in the world.Designed by pop artist Peter Blake, the cover was an orderly collage ofsixty-two of the Beatles's “people we like.” In the top row, sandwiched betweenHindu holy man Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri1 [part0023.html#itr-fn1] and Mae West,beams the unmistakable visage of Aleister Crowley.Beatles fanatics (and they were and are legion) dissected every word of everycut of that historic album in hopes of uncovering secret political messages orspiritual truths. They also spent countless hours trying to identify every faceon the cover and ponder why the Beatles would number that person among “peoplethey liked.” It was easy to guess why they would include holy men, hipsters, andheroes—personal friends and movie stars. Everyone in the collage seemed to besomeone most any of us would like—everyone, that is, except Aleister Crowley. Ofall sixty-two “people we like,” Aleister Crowley was the only one with apatently evil reputation. Some of us wanted to know more about this man.I'm not suggesting that the Beatles consciously contrived to resurrect aworldwide interest in Aleister Crowley. I truly believe that one or more of them(most likely John Lennon) simply knew enough about Crowley to warrant hisinclusion. Nonetheless, since 1967, interest in Crowley has mushroomed.Currently there are no less than seven biographies in print (three published injust the past three years). His written works, which until the mid-'70s were fewand nearly impossible to find, are now available everywhere and translated intomany languages.Perhaps most astonishing is the fact that the magick of Aleister Crowley—hisThelemic philosophy—(his program of Scientific Illumination) is embraced bythousands of people from all walks of life throughout the world. Even theEnglish public, whose opinion of him in life was so terribly misguided, is nowawakening to the national treasure this native son represents. In 2002, the BBCconducted a poll of 30,000 Britons, asking them to name their “Greatest Briton.”Voted number 73 among the top 100 greatest Britons of all time, between KingHenry V and Robert Bruce, was the “famous poet, author, and philosopher AleisterCrowley.”2 [part0023.html#itr-fn2]Love is the law, love under will.—LON MILO DUQUETTEVernal Equinox 2003"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ZEROimages [../images/00006.jpeg]FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT ALEISTER CROWLEYBury me in a nameless grave!I came from God the world to save.I brought them wisdom from above:Worship and liberty and love.They slew me for I did disparageTherefore Religion, Law, and Marriage.So be my grave without a nameThat earth may swallow up my shame!—ALEISTER CROWLEY1 [part0023.html#chap0-fn1]Aleister Crowley is dead. He died of natural causes on December 1, 1947, at theage of seventy-two at his residence at Netherwood, Hastings. His body wasdiscovered by his landlord who reported that only moments earlier he had heardthe old man pacing back and forth across the floor of his second-storyapartment. There was no one with him when the end came; therefore reports thathis last words were, “I'm perplexed” are patently false.Contrary to many reports, he did not die a raving lunatic. He was bright andwitty to the end. In fact, two of his most extraordinarily brilliant works, TheBook of Thoth and Magick Without Tears, were penned in years just before hisdeath. His last days were not spent in squalor and abject poverty. His modestresidence in Hastings was a charming and reputable boardinghouse.Distortions of the facts surrounding his death are minor compared to those thatstill surround the events of his life. But it is not the purpose of this work tosystematically rebut the mountains of misinformation that still denigrate thereputation of this remarkable man. This has been accomplished admirably in avariety of well-researched biographies including the following works that I donot hesitate to recommend:A Magick Life, The Biography of Aleister Crowley by Martin Booth, London: Hodder& Stoughton, 2000.Do What Thou Wilt, A Life of Aleister Crowley by Lawrence Sutin, New York: St.Martin's Press, 2000.Perdurabo: The Life of Aleister Crowley by Richard Kaczynski, Ph.D., Scottsdale,AZ: New Falcon Publications, 2003.Even though the focus of this book is upon the importance of the ritual works ofAleister Crowley, I would be remiss in my responsibility to the beginningstudent if I did not at the outset endeavor to disabuse the reader who hasperhaps given credence to the misstatements and downright whoppers that continueto be perpetuated by religious zealots and tabloid journalists.Below are some frequently asked questions about Aleister Crowley. My answers arethe result of thirty years of research into every aspect of his life; interviewswith individuals both here and abroad, who knew and worked with him, includingMajor G.L. McMurtry and Dr. Francis (Israel) Regardie, and a review of historicdocuments in the archives of Ordo Templi Orientis, the George Arents ResearchLibrary, Bird Library, Syracuse university, the university of Texas at Austin,and the Gerald Yorke collection currently housed at the Warburg Institute of theuniversity of London.Frequently Asked Questions About Aleister Crowley• Was Aleister Crowley a Satanist or a devil worshiper?No. Although he can be misquoted (and quoted out of context) to suggestotherwise, Crowley most certainly was not a Satanist or a devil worshiper.2[part0023.html#chap0-fn2] There is no question that he seemed to enjoy hissinister reputation. It is also true that he loved to shock the shockable andwas happy to allow anyone who was ignorant and superstitious enough to believein a bogeyman devil to be afraid of him also. But in order to be a Satanist (bythe most common definition during Crowley's lifetime) one must acknowledge thereality of the Judeo-Christian-Muslim spiritual worldview—a worldview thatembraces the concept of a devil who is the all-evil opposite to a god who is allgood. As Crowley repudiated Judeo-Christian-Muslim doctrines (including beliefin the existence of their “devil”) there are no grounds whatsoever to chargethat he was a Satanist.“The devil does not exist. It is a false name invented by the Black Brothers toimply a Unity in their ignorant muddle of dispersions. A devil who had unitywould be a god.”3 [part0023.html#chap0-fn3]It is true that there is much in the imagery of Crowley's writings that is darkand at first glance very terrifying. But if we view these works objectively, wefind nothing in them any more frightening than the imagery we find in the Bibleor any number of other religious literature, Eastern or Western.Crowley especially despised the hypocrisy and the spiritually restrictiveaspects of established religions, especially Christianity, and did not denycharges that his philosophy was anti-Christian. However, a careful examinationof his writings reveals his profound understanding and respect for the purespiritual impulse that is at the heart of all religions including Christianity.His allusions in his writings to Satan, Lucifer, the devil, and so forth arepertinent only within the self-referential documents of Thelema. They can onlybe understood and evaluated within those contexts and should only be disturbingor offensive to those individuals who for whatever reason are unwilling orunable to do a little honest homework.• Was he a Black Magician?At the beginning of chapter 8 [part0017.html] you will find a quote by Crowleythat defines the term “black magic” in its strictest context. However, thecommon definition of a Black Magician is someone who willfully uses magicalpowers to harm others. Crowley was bound by multiple magical oaths to devote allhis energies—intellectual, artistic, magical, and spiritual—toward the completeemancipation of the human race. His entire magical career, indeed his entirelife, was dedicated to that purpose. He most certainly did not fit the abovedefinition of a Black Magician. But, as I said earlier, for those unwilling orunable to do a little objective homework many of the magical operations Crowleychronicled in his diaries and books may on the surface appear to be works ofblack magic.For example, if you haven't read enough of Crowley's works to learn that Goeticdemons are “portions of the human brain”4 [part0023.html#chap0-fn4] or that the“Hell” into which the magician plunges in order to conquer and command those“demons” is our own subconscious mind or that the curses and restraints themagician uses in particular forms of black magic are merely techniques toisolate, focus, and direct our own natural mental abilities—then there is littlechance of convincing you that these exercises are not black magic and that thoseindividuals who would try to better themselves by such spiritual practices arenot Black Magicians.• Why did he call himself the Beast 666?Crowley's father was a lay preacher of the Plymouth Brethren, a fundamentalistProtestant sect. His mother was also a devout (Crowley says “fanatical”) memberof the church. Together they did their best to raise young Alic in the tenets ofthe faith. However, the youngster was a mischievous and headstrong lad, and hismother equated his behavior to the rebelliousness of the devil himself. Inmoments of aggravation she called him the “Beast 666.” He loved it, and as hegrew up he delighted in identifying with the name and number as representativeof all things joyously opposed to the spiritual, intellectual, emotional, andsexual restrictions by which oppressive religions would enslave the human soul.As a young man just beginning his study of Hebrew and Christian mysticism,Crowley discovered that the number 666, rather than being a number associatedwith evil, was especially sacred to the Sun and the heart Chakra (or psychiccenter) in the human body—also called the Christ center.To understand why 666 is a magick number of the Sun, we first refer to theQabalistic diagram the Tree of Life (see page ii [part0001.html#page_ii]) anddiscover that the sphere of the Sun is the sixth Sephirah, Tiphareth. A kamea(or magick square) of the Sun is a square composed of 36 squares (6 × 6). Thenumbers 1-36 are then arranged in such a way that every row and every column addto the same number. That number is 111, and the sum of all the squares is 666.Like other “blasphemies” he would hijack from Christian literature to expressthe dynamics of new Aeon concepts (i.e., Whore of Babalon, Blood of the Saints,Cup of Abominations, etc.), the term “Beast 666” was just another example ofCrowley using concepts that in the past represented the unholy terrors of anevil future, and redeeming them so that they presently represent the holymysteries of the emerging new age. It's as simple (and as unsatanic) as that.Crowley explained why he called himself the Beast 666 when he testified in courtin a 1934 lawsuit. I wish I had space to reprint the entire testimony.images [../images/00007.jpeg]“Did you take to yourself the designation of ‘The Beast 666'?”“Yes.”“Do you call yourself the ‘Master Therion'?”“Yes.”“What does ‘Therion' mean?”“Great wild beast.”“Do these titles convey a fair impression of your practice and outlook on life?”“It depends on what they mean.”“The Great Wild Beast and the Beast 666 are out of the Apocalypse?”“It only means sunlight; 666 is the number of the sun. You can call me ‘LittleSunshine.'”5 [part0023.html#chap0-fn5]• Did he advocate or perform human sacrifices?Crowley clothed many of his teaching in a thin veil of sensational titillation.By doing so he assured himself that one, his works would be understood andappreciated only by the few individuals capable of doing so, and two, his workswould continue to generate interest and be published by and for the benefit ofboth his admirers and his enemies long after his death.He did not—I repeat—did not perform or advocate human sacrifice. He was oftenguilty, however, of the crime of poor judgment.Like all of us, Crowley had many flaws and shortcomings. The greatest of these,in my opinion, was his inability to understand that everyone else in the worldwas not as educated and clever as he. It is clear, even in his earliest works,that he constantly overestimated the level of sophistication of his readers, andthat he took fiendish delight in terrifying those who were either too lazy, toobigoted, or too slow-witted to understand him. Even when it is obvious that heis doing his best to be clear and comprehensible his never-ending allusions toclassical literature, chemistry, esoteric doctrines, myths, and ancientcivilizations send the average student flying to the nearest university libraryto discover what this man is talking about.It is even more difficult to discover what he is trying to say when hepurposefully veils the true meaning of his words so that only initiatespossessed of specific information know what he is really talking about.Such is the case when he wrote about sex magick. First of all, he felt bound byvarious oaths not to openly reveal certain secrets of sexual magick. Secondly,in the years he was writing on these subjects, one could actually be arrestedfor writing too explicitly about sexual matters.Unfortunately, in part 3, chapter 12 [part0021.html] of Magick: Book Four, LiberABA,6 [part0023.html#chap0-fn6] where Crowley attempts to discuss theories andtechniques of sexual magick, it seems he was not satisfied with being simplysubtle; he went out of his way to be scandalously misunderstood. For perhaps ascore of initiates on the face of the Earth at that time, chapter 12[part0021.html] was an informative (and in places hilarious) essay on the theoryand practice of sex magick. Among other fool traps, he uses the words “blood”and “death” and “kill” to replace the words “semen” and “ecstasy” and“ejaculation.” To the unwary, the entire chapter reads like one big instructionmanual on human and animal sacrifice. Big joke!Nobody laughed.He titled the chapter, Of the Bloody Sacrifice, and of Matters Cognate, and I'msure he thought everyone would understand his literary blind when they reachedthe end of the chapter and read his last sentence: “You are also likely to getinto trouble over this chapter unless you truly comprehend its meaning.”.The footnote to that statement is even clearer:There is a traditional saying that whenever an adept seems to have made astraightforward, comprehensible statement, then is it most certain that He meanssomething entirely different. The Truth is nevertheless clearly set forth in HisWords: it is His simplicity that baffles the unworthy. I have chosen theexpressions in the Chapter in such a way that it is likely to mislead thosemagicians who allow selfish interests to cloud their intelligence, but to giveuseful hints to such as are bound by the proper Oaths to devote their powers tolegitimate ends.7 [part0023.html#chap0-fn7]I guess it didn't occur to Crowley that few people would ever read his assuringcomments because the average reader was scared to death by the seventhparagraph:For the highest spiritual working one must accordingly choose that victim whichcontains the greatest and purest force. A male child of perfect innocence andhigh intelligence is the most satisfactory suitable victim…. [And its footnote:]It appears from the Magical Records of Frater Perdurabo that He made thisparticular sacrifice on an average about 150 times every year between 1912 E.V.and 1928 E.V.8 [part0023.html#chap0-fn8]It should be obvious to anyone who carefully reads the chapter and its footnotesthat the only thing to which Crowley was confessing was a great manyejaculations that did not result in the birth of a child. However, in 1923 whenhe wrote the above “confession,” such candor in print could not be published.Ironically, talk of human sacrifice and other such shocking subjects could.Martha Kuntzel, a Crowley disciple and high-ranking member of the German O.T.O.,saw trouble coming and was understandably concerned that this statement would bemisunderstood. She insisted to Crowley that the following “initiatedinterpretation” of his outrageous statement be added “for the sake of theyounger Brethren.”It is the sacrifice of oneself spiritually. And the intelligence and innocenceof that male child are the perfect understanding of the Magician, his one aim,without lust of result. And male he must be, because what he sacrifices is notthe material blood, but his creative power.”9 [part0023.html#chap0-fn9]Unfortunately, people who were only too happy to believe that Aleister Crowleycould personally murder 2,550 babies didn't pay much attention to Kuntzel's“initiated interpretation.” To make matters worse Crowley thoughtfully remindsus: “But the bloody sacrifice, though more dangerous, is more efficacious; andfor nearly all purposes human sacrifice is the best.”10[part0023.html#chap0-fn10]Thank you very much Mr. Crowley! I'm sure I will not be the last author who willfeel obliged to try to explain your twisted sense of humor to his or herreaders, colleagues, or mother.• Did he advocate or perform animal sacrifices?Crowley did not advocate or perform animal sacrifices for magical or religiouspurposes. Besides indulging in the hunting escapades of a proper Britishsportsman, and the consumption of live clams and oysters, Crowley confessed tothree other “murderous” acts: 1) As a boy, he killed a cat to test the validityof the statement, “a cat has nine lives.” 2) As a young man, while attempting to“go native” in India, he paid for a goat to be sacrificed at a Temple of Shiva.3) Before dining on frog's legs while camping in America, he performed a briefpassion play before dressing the victim for the skillet.Even though there are what appear to be references to the practice in some ofthe Holy Books of Thelema, animal sacrifice plays no part whatsoever in theMagick of Aleister Crowley.• Was he a drug addict?Crowley's early belief that drugs could not harm the magician possessed of apure enough will was dashed by the example of his own life. Crowley's struggleswith heroin and cocaine addiction are legendary. At various stages of his lifehe was most certainly a drug addict. He also bravely overcame his addiction forlengthy periods of time and finally only needed his prescriptions to diminisheffects of severe asthma and extend his life.• Was he a homosexual?So…what if he was?(Sorry. I couldn't help that!).Actually, Crowley was bisexual, and I believe he would be absolutely thrilledwith twenty-first century attitudes concerning sexuality.• Was he a traitor to England and/or a German spy?Charges that Crowley was a traitor to England and perhaps even a German spy stemfrom several newspaper editorials he wrote in New York City, just prior toAmerica's entry into the war on England's side.It must be remembered that the United States was very close to entering theFirst World War on Germany's side. America's large German population and otherpowerful industrial interests were winning the public relations battle in thepress. If England was to survive, something had to be done to sway Americanpublic opinion to the English cause. Crowley convinced the publisher of theleading English-language German propaganda newspaper that he was a Germansympathizer. He was given an editorial position at the paper and began to writethe most outrageously bizarre editorials. He equated Kaiser Willhelm withParsifal and Jesus Christ. He trumpeted Germany's right to rule the world. Heeven went so far as to write that Germany had the right to engage inunrestricted submarine warfare against the world's civilian shipping.None of these things, I might add, reflected the German political or militaryforeign policy of the time. But it didn't matter. Soon Crowley's insane andblood-thirsty editorials created an anti-German hysteria that eventually sweptthe United States into the conflict on England's side.His adventures in the Second World War are also interesting. The following isfrom my Understanding Aleister Crowley's Thoth Tarot.11[part0023.html#chap0-fn11]During World War II, at the request of friend and Naval Intelligence officer IanFleming,12 [part0023.html#chap0-fn12] Crowley provided Winston Churchill withvaluable insights into the superstitions and magical mindset of the leaders ofthe Third Reich. He also suggested to the Prime Minister, if reports can bebelieved, that he exploit the enemy's magical paranoia by being photographed asmuch as possible giving the two-fingered “V-for-Victory” gesture. This sign is aversion of the magical sign of Apophis-Typhon, a powerful symbol of destructionand annihilation, which, according to magical tradition, is capable of defeatingthe solar energies represented by the swastika.British intelligence agencies will neither confirm nor deny that AleisterCrowley (or anyone else for that matter) was in service. Throughout his life headamantly averred his patriotic loyalty to England. There is much evidence tosuggest that he was and none to prove he was not.• Is it dangerous to study Aleister Crowley?Aleister Crowley was by no means perfect. He was not good with people and oftenalienated those who loved him dearest. His bold explorations of human sexualityand drugs (always meticulously recorded and analyzed) are fascinating to study,but were never intended to be casually emulated. I have never encountered anyonewho knew him that did not disapprove of some aspect of his character orbehavior.But he is dead. For us, only his works remain as a measure of the man, and theyare currently more accessible to the general public than at any time during hislife. His influence on the modern world of art, literature, religion, andphilosophy is now widely acknowledged even by his most vehement critics. It ismy hope that this book may help bring the wonder of his genius to a newgeneration of seekers and to an even broader audience of students.But is it dangerous for some people to study Aleister Crowley? I guess I have tosay yes. For those whose belief in a God of goodness hinges upon the reality ofdevil who is equally evil; for the superstitious, the ignorant, the lazy, theimmature, the unbalanced, the mentally ill, the paranoid, the fainthearted; foranyone who for any reason cannot or will not take responsibility for their ownactions, their own lives, their own souls; for these people Aleister Crowley isstill a very dangerous man."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONEimages [../images/00006.jpeg]THE MAGICK OF WILLMagick is the Science and Art of causing change tooccur in conformity with Will.—MAGICK IN THEORY AND PRACTICEThe above definition of Magick can be as misleading in its simplicity as it isin its complexity. The key word is of course Will, images[../images/00008.jpeg]1 [part0023.html#chap1-fn1] in Greek, and according tothis definition, any willed action is an act of Magick: brushing your teeth,walking the dog, or even paying your taxes.Conversely any unwilled action is an unmagical act: reaching for a cigarette;ordering that fourth Martini; or any habitual or reactive behavior thatoverrides the momentum of one's life focus could fall into the category of anunmagical act.Try as we might there is no escaping this simple fact: We are all Magicians andwe are either competent or incompetent practitioners of our craft.The great majority of successful Magicians do not even realize (nor should theycare) that they are Magicians, or that there is a name for what they do so well.They just go through life striving to cause change to occur in conformity withtheir Wills and that's that. They have made a science out of their lifestyle andthey execute it with great art. They work hard, but for them the work is not aburden it is a labor of love and a continuing expression of the purpose of theirexistence.Obviously most of us do not, without great effort, fall into this fortunatecategory of human being. Our Magick falls somewhere between competence andincompetence. Occasionally we become aware of what our Will is (or might be) andtry to work the Magick. But more often than not, we find ourselves simplyresponding to an endless chain reaction of external events and circumstancesover which we have little or no control.Out of fear, frustration, or what might be called spiritual fatigue, many of usturn to religions whose champions are more than happy to tell us, in nouncertain terms, exactly where our place in the universe is.The religions that Westerners most frequently are attracted to (Christianity,with its many sects, Judaism, and Islam) postulate a Supreme Being whopersonifies and manifests the order of the universe. The mechanism of this orderis often termed the “Will of God.” By surrendering the individual will to Willof God, the religious devotee can theoretically harmonize his or her life withthat of the Deity's. Not my will, but Thine be done.In order for us to know God's Will, these religions offer, for our great comfort(and often from ancient and “infallible” sources), rules, commandments, andassorted scriptural injunctions to guide the thoughts and behavior of thefaithful. As an added safeguard that these scriptures be “correctly”interpreted, a priestcraft of some form or another invariably evolves andassumes the role of a visible mediator between the worshiper and the Deity.2[part0023.html#chap1-fn2] For those who dutifully comply with the dictatedformulae and surrender their wills to the prescribed Will of God, a great burdenis lifted from their shoulders. They no longer feel the need for directspiritual experience, and faith in the infallibility of the dogmatists makeseven intellectual investigation unnecessary. The reward for such spiritualcollaborators is the smug comfort of knowing that those who haven't submitted tothe formula will suffer after death, and that they who have, will not.Magick also postulates a universal order—call it God, Nature, the Supreme Being,the Grand Architect of the Universe, the Tao, or just the-way-things-are. Butthe Magician knows that the pure Will of every man and every woman is already inperfect harmony with the divine Will; in fact they are one and the same. It isthe Magician's Great Work to endeavor to remove the obstacles that hinder his orher perfect realization of that Will and then proceed to execute it.We perceive in the world around us a vast cosmic orderliness (or at least aglorious systematized chaos). Galaxies, stars, planets, atoms, electrons, andother sub-atomic particles all seem to have found their niche in the grandscheme of things and behave themselves accordingly. By realizing our True Willswe find our place…our orbit. By doing our True Will, we have the inertia of theentire universe to assist us.The Magician does not necessarily want the burden of existence lifted from hisshoulders; he wants to understand why he is carrying it and where."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWOimages [../images/00006.jpeg]THE EVOLUTION OF MAGICAL FORMULAEIn the Years of the Primal Course, in the dawn of terrestrial birth,Man mastered the mammoth and horse; and Man was the Lord of the Earth.He made him an hollow skin from the heart of an holy tree;He compassed the earth therein, and Man was the Lord of the Sea.He controlled the vigour of steam, he harnessed the lightning for hire;He drove the celestial team; and Man was the Lord of the Fire.Deep-mouthed from their thrones deep-seated, the choirs of the aeons declareThe last of the demons defeated, for Man is the Lord of the Air.Arise, 0 man, in thy strength! the kingdom is thine to inherit,Till the high gods witness at length that Man is the Lord of his spirit.—THE PENTAGRAMAmagical formula is a statement of perceived cosmological fact or theory It canbe as simple as an axiom:Love thy neighbor as thyself. An apple a day keeps the doctor away.It can be a statement or a set of symbols revealing the mechanism of a naturallaw:As above, so below. All is sorrow. Love is the law, love under will.E = MC2. YHVH. INRI. AUM.It can even be a single word that initiates an entire age:TAO; ANATTA; IAΩ; ΘελημαMagical formulae evolve from older magical formulae as humanity's ability toperceive itself and the universe increases. A change in the consciousness of therace necessitates a change in magical formula. It's not that the old formuladoesn't work anymore, it's just that the new one works so much better. Obsoleteformulae of the past aren't necessarily discarded completely but are oftenamended or fine-tuned to better harmonize with a new, expanded understanding ofnatural or spiritual law.To use an apparently unmagical example, an ancient carpenter or craftsmanseeking to determine the area of a small circle might venerate the greatMagician who revealed to him that the area could be determined by measuring theradius of the circle, then multiplying that figure by itself, then multiplyingthat figure by the sacred number 3. For the rough calculations required by ourprimitive ancestors, this crude formula served quite adequately. But for larger,more complex projects (such as temples, pyramids, etc.) requiring precisecomputations, the world had to wait for the “Magick” of π. Once this new bit ofinformation became general knowledge the world was never the same.While this is a very crude analogy, I am confident that the reader can see howit applies to our ever evolving perception of ourselves and our place in theuniverse.The Formula of the New AgeGreat spiritual periods (ages or aeons) are characterized by their magicalformula. This is very important and fundamental to the understanding of Magickin general and Thelemic Magick in particular, for the planet has just recently(relatively speaking) entered a new period; a new age; a new aeon.Yes, this is coincidental to what astrologers and songwriters call the Age ofAquarius1 [part0023.html#chap2-fn1] and what millions of others refer to simplyas the New Age. But it would be a mistake to view this new aeon as simplyanother tick on a great cosmic clock. The Age of Aquarius, profoundlysignificant as it is, is only one aspect of a far greater new spiritual age.(Such magical aeons do not necessarily coincide with the astrological periodsand, according to Crowley2 [part0023.html#chap2-fn2], may be of any length.) Amore intimate, more magical perspective may be had if, rather than consideringthe ages as merely astrological epochs, we instead view them as gods.Crowley recognized in the three principal gods of Egypt Isis, Osiris, and Horusthe characteristic formulae of the last three magical aeons.The present aeon is that of Horus, which has followed the Aeon of Osiris, whichfollowed the Aeon of Isis. Each aeon is characterized by the level ofunderstanding of nature and of self contemporarily prevalent, and dictates thevariety of magical and religious expression that dominate these periods.Here it will be necessary to take a moment to review the myth of Isis, Osiris,and Horus, for it is vitally important to the understanding of the evolution ofmagical formulae and the Magick of Thelema. Please keep in mind that this isonly the briefest sketch of a story that has undergone over four thousand yearsof revision.THE MYTH OF OSIRISTHE CREATOR, Temu, first appeared (from out of a watery chaos) on a sacredmound. Upon this solid foundation of matter he masturbated, creating twochildren, brother and sister, Shu and Tefnet. These two in turn created Geb (theEarth-god) and Nut3 [part0023.html#chap2-fn3] (the Sky-goddess) who united togive birth to Osiris, Isis4 [part0023.html#chap2-fn4], Seth5[part0023.html#chap2-fn5], and Nephthys. These nine deities make up the enneadof Heliopolis, which appear continually throughout the sacred texts.Osiris became king of Egypt, supported by his sister-wife Isis. Theirs was agolden reign that raised the Egyptian people from the sub-human depths ofanarchy and cannibalism. They initiated the systematic cultivation of the landin harmony with the flooding cycle of the river Nile, and their administrationbrought prosperity and happiness.Seth, the brother of Osiris, became increasingly envious of the success of hissibling, and conspired to have him assassinated. Secretly he had an ornate boxconstructed to the exact measurements of the body of Osiris. He then hosted alavish party for his brother and announced that he would award the box to anyonewho could fit perfectly inside. In what can only be described as an act ofdivine folly, Osiris volunteered to give it a try. As soon as he was comfortablysnuggled inside the perfectly fitting box, the lid was immediately nailed shutby seventy-two of Seth's coconspirators and the coffin set adrift on the Nile.Isis, hearing of the murder, immediately set out to find the body. Shediscovered it at Byblos where it had become imbedded in a tree which had beencut down and used, because of its wondrous aroma, as a column in the palace ofthe king. She pleaded with the local king for the return of her husband's bodyand was allowed to take it.As she was returning with it by boat, she laid down upon the body and kissed ituntil its phallus became miraculously erect. She mounted her dead husband andconceived the child Horus. (Horus or Hoor also has a brother, Hoor-Paar-Kraat,whom the Greeks called Harpocrates. More on this later.)Seth, discovering where Isis had hidden the body, stole it, dismembered it, andscattered the fourteen pieces throughout the entire country.Isis set out again and successfully recovered all the pieces of Osiris, saveone6 [part0023.html#chap2-fn6], and magically reassembled them, therebybestowing upon Osiris immortality and rulership of the afterlife. Henceforthpious individuals who faithfully adhered to the complex magical formulae of thecult of Osiris, as outlined in The Book of the Dead, would be assured of thesame continuity of existence after death.Their son Horus, to avenge the murder of his father, initiated a mighty struggleagainst Seth, which according to some stories was successful after three daysand according to others is perpetuated to this day.images [../images/00009.jpeg]The images of this simple passion play are imbedded deeply in the collectiveconsciousness of the human race. We see it retold almost verbatim by the Greeksas the story of Demeter and Persephone, and Orpheus and Eurydice. IAO, the greatGod of the Gnostics, even announces the magical formula of life, death, andresurrection in the letters of its name: Isis (Nature) is ruined by Apophis (theforces of destruction and decay), but is cyclically resurrected in Osiris.Most striking to the Western mind are the similarities between the story ofOsiris and the central myth of Christianity: Through treachery a wise youngsavior is murdered…nailed to His death; the tree whereon the body is affixed;the mourning devotee who begs the return of His body in order to give it properburial; the resurrection of the God which also provides the formula for theeternal salvation of the world, etc. All very Osirian.But I am getting ahead of myself. To understand where we are, we must firstunderstand where we have been, so let us first examine the conditions thatcharacterized the last two aeons.The Aeon of IsisThe Formula of the Great Goddess: It is difficult to speculate precisely whenthe aeon of the formula of Isis began for its foundations were laid in thenebulousness of prehistory. However, we can with relative confidence venture topinpoint its zenith as being approximately 2400 B.C.7 [part0023.html#chap2-fn7]This was the Age of the Great Goddess, and nowhere at this time was Her worshipmore conspicuous than in the Sumerian city of Uruk where the magnificent templeof Innana (Ishtar) dominated civilization's first great city. For us to focusexclusively upon Sumeria, however, would be a grave error for, indeed, the cultof the Great Goddess was truly universal. She was worshiped by countlesscultures under myriad names and forms. It would also be a mistake for us toconclude that the magical formula of this period manifested exclusively throughthe worship of any particular anthropomorphic female deity. For, like everyaeon, the magical formula of the Aeon of Isis was founded upon mankind'sinterpretation of the “perceived facts” of nature, and our Isian-age progenitorsperceived nature as a continuous process of spontaneous growth.In the dim beginnings of the aeon, humans were ignorant of the cause and effectmysteries of sex and birth. Life appeared to come from woman alone. Blood flowedinexplicably from her body with the same cycle as that of the moon. And when thecycle of bleeding was interrupted, her belly swelled for nine moons until sheburst with new life. She then continued to nourish this life with her milk, thewhite blood of her breasts, and without this nourishment, drawn directly fromher body, the new life would die.Nothing could match the power of woman. From her all life proceeded and withouther nourishment no life could survive. Like the moon itself, she lived athree-fold life cycle of maid, mother, and crone; fertility, sustenance, andwisdom.Once the child was weaned, the Earth itself became surrogate mother, directlyproviding the flesh and blood of animals and plants for sustenance. Mother waslife. Earth was Mother. God was Woman. Death was a mystery that could not besolved nor overcome.This fundamental perception of nature persisted long after the mystery of wherebabies came from had been solved. Matriarchies and cannibalism dominated much ofthis period, but even after the ascent of the male warrior gods, the essentialformula of the Goddess lived on.There exist to this day tribes of hunter-gatherers8 [part0023.html#chap2-fn8]whose social and religious lives exemplify the formula of Isis, but the Aeon ofIsis survived only as long as the spirit of humanity was dominated by theperception that life and its requisite nourishment came directly from the Earthand from the woman.A clearer perception of the universe would evolve that would usurp the formulaof Isis and initiate a new cultural and religious age. We are painfully familiarwith this period for it lasted until the turn of the twentieth century. Itsformula is still the consensus of the so-called “Great Religions” and continuesto dominate the spiritual lives of the majority of the inhabitants of ourplanet.In this age the focus was shifted from the Earth to the Sun as the source of alllife, and from the mysteries of birth to the mysteries of death. We figured outwhere babies came from; now we were to ponder where we go when we die.The Aeon of OsirisThe Formula of the Dying God: It could be said that the Aeon of Osiris beganwhen men and women first became cognizant of the Sun, and recognized that thefertility of the Earth (and consequently their lives) depended directly upon thevitalizing power of sunlight. The secret of life was now perceived as apartnership of Sun and Earth, and our ancestors saw this partnership reflectedin themselves: man and woman, phallus and kteis, father and mother.When it became universally acknowledged that without the Sun, the Earth wouldperish, and without the semen of man, woman would remain barren, the greatpendulum of racial consciousness and attitude took a radical swing. The formulaof Isis was altered: woman brings forth life, but life comes from the Sun. Godwas now Father.This new “illumination” resulted in unprecedented advances in civilization.Armed with the solar knowledge of the cycles of seasons, Osirian-age farmersbegan the organized cultivation of crops. Cities arose, and with them theeconomies and armies of great nation-states. Patriarchies supplantedmatriarchies as the goddesses of countless cultures became “wives” to the newmale deities.But inherent in this new formula was a terrible mystery; a factor that was not apart of the formula of the innocent Aeon of Isis; a dark reality that wouldbecome an all-consuming (and some say, unhealthy) preoccupation of the Aeon ofOsiris: death.It was perceived as an undeniable fact that the Sun, the source of all life, wasborn each day on the eastern horizon and traveled across the sky, bestowing Hiswarm blessings of light and life upon all the Earth. It was also observed thisgreat pangenetor “died” each day in the West, plunging the entire world into acold darkness—a darkness that evoked introspection and fear. Where did the Sungo? Would a new one ever reappear?Each night after the death of the Sun, our early Osirian-age ancestor fell intoan uneasy slumber, and in that sleep lived another life—a strange life, peopledwith other men and women, and filled with impossible wonders and horrors.Animals killed in the hunt, dead relatives, enemies, and comrades, all camealive again in this other world of dream. Was this where the Sun went at night?Was this the Land of the Dead?Of course the fearful night did not last forever and a “new” Sun appeared withcomforting regularity each morning to conquer the darkness and assure thecontinuity of life. But later, more sophisticated Sun watchers would experiencean even greater insecurity crisis when they observed the dwindling periods ofsunlight (as summer moved toward winter) resulted in the decrease or actualcessation of the fecundity of the Earth. No sunlight, no crops. This wasserious.The daily solar cycle showed them that the Sun is capable of totallydisappearing from the sky. But unlike the relatively short period of darkness ofthe daily cycle, there was no telling how long a great night would last if theSun ever experienced a yearly death. Surely all life would end in the frozendarkness of an eternal (or even a lengthy) night.Unfounded as these fears were, they were based solidly upon a perceived reality,and the trauma became indelibly imprinted upon the psyche of the human race.This “reality” in turn, formed the foundation of the magical formula of the Aeonof Osiris, the formula of the Dying God.The Sun, the Father of all Life, goes through a three-fold cycle of birth(life), death, and resurrection. Humankind, knowing themselves also subject todeath, believed that by following the magical or religious formula of the Sun,they too could be made eligible for resurrection. What was this formula?Everywhere our Osirian-age ancestors looked, they saw the drama of the Dying Godenacted. The farmer observed the fertilizing effects that blood and decayingflesh had upon the soil; and that seeds (which came from living plants in thesummer and autumn) could lie dead and buried throughout the winter months, andthen miraculously resurrect as new plants in the spring. It was an obvious andinescapable truth: without death there is no life.Did not the Sun suffer death each night and each winter so it might be reborn?Did not the seed offer itself to the Earth so that it might resurrect as a newplant? After ejaculation did not the penis sacrifice its potency to fertilizethe ovum and perpetuate the race?Life from death was a fact, and to assure that the blessings of life wouldcontinue to come out of death, our Osirian-age ancestors believed they must takean active part in the great life/death ritual. To this end they took themselvesto mountain tops and high places. They gathered stones and proceeded to buildaltars and offer up sacrifice to the gods.Obviously the great cultural/religious myth of the Egyptians was literallyOsirian in nature, but by the dawn of the astrological Age of Pisces(approximately 260 B.C.), the formula of the Dying God had crystalized itself asthe central myth of countless cultures and civilizations. The gods of the greatmystery cults—Orpheus, Hercules, Dionysus, Attis, Adonis, and later Christ—allwere slain and resurrected. The story of Persephone, the central figure of theEleusinian Mysteries which flourished for over two thousand years, is a perfectexample of the evolution of the formula of the Great Goddess to that of theDying God.These cults were wildly popular. To assure one's own resurrection it wasnecessary to be an initiate and follow the god's formula of catastrophe, love,death, and resurrection. Partially patterned after these mystery schools,orthodox Christianity arose to become the dominant spiritual and politicalinfluence of the world for the last two thousand years.The formula of sacrifice was born of the mistaken belief that the Sun came up inthe morning and went down in the evening. A more accurate perception of theuniverse is now enjoyed by humanity. We know the Sun does not come up nor doesit go down. It does not travel North in the summer nor does it move towardextinction in the South in the winter. The Sun stays “on” all the time. Thelight is continuous. The death of the Sun is merely an optical illusion, ashifting of shadow.So universally accepted is this simple fact of nature that today we seldom giveit a second thought. Yet the archetypes that influence the great cultural andreligious forces of today were formulated during those eras of profoundignorance and superstition. The stories of the dying Sun and the Dying God weremyths created, in part, to help our ancestors overcome their fear of the darkand their fear of death. The perception of the universe that initiated the Aeonof Osiris has been forever changed. The formula has been amended. There is noneed to fear the dark. There is no need to fear death.The Aeon of HorusThe Formula of the Crowned and Conquering Child: As the child is the physicaland genetic product of both its parents, so too the Aeon of Horus reconciles andtranscends the formulae of the two previous Ages. Since the turn of the centurywe have seen the fall of colonialism and the destruction of the last vestiges ofthe overtly patriarchal rule of kings in Europe. The temporal power of the Popeis gone, and the illusion of the omnipotent spiritual power of the Church hasbecome diluted beyond hope of revival.The earth-mother worshiping formula of the Aeon of Isis (violently repressedduring the Aeon of Osiris) has been transformed by the evolution of ourconsciousness, and resurrected as the earth-respecting environmental movement,the Woman's Movement, and the resurgence of the cult of the Goddess.These developments are seen by the established institutions as blasphemousexamples of spiritual and the unholy degeneration of humanity. They grosslymisinterpret their own scriptures to warn of an inevitable cleansingconflagration that will reestablish an even greater Osirian rule.While a certain amount of conflict probably is inevitable (as it is at thebeginning of every age), the result most certainly will not be a return to theformulae of the past. Standing, as we are, upon the threshold of the Aeon ofHorus, what we observe happening in the world is rather unsettling. But it isthe natural result of the vested interests of the old aeon resisting theestablishment of the new. It is very much like the strife families experiencewhen a child grows up and finally leaves home. Eventually the parents accept theinevitable and, in most cases, form a new and supportive relationship with theirchild.We are the child who has just become self-aware. We still love our mother andfather but we know we will never be happy as long as we exist only as anextension of their lives. Now that we are conscious of the continuity ofexistence, now that we perceive the universe as a process of continual growth,now that we recognize the individual as the basic unit of society, we will neverreturn to the flawed and incomplete perceptions of the past."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREEimages [../images/00006.jpeg]THE BOOK OF THE LAWDo what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.The study of this Book is forbidden.

This is a bit like walking a tightrope. I confess that I amnot a high initiate, nor am I an exemplary specimen of the ideal Thelemite. Thereader is honor-bound to disregard anything I say if it appears that I haveoverstepped my bounds in this regard.As it is impossible to understand the rituals of Thelema without a basicfamiliarity with Liber AL vel Legis, The Book of the Law, it would be unfair tothe owners of this handbook if we did not include it in its entirety. Thedeities and magical formulae revealed in this small volume are the very essenceof the Aeon of Horus.Details of how this unique book came into being are outlined in Crowley's TheEquinox of the Gods,1 [part0023.html#chap3-fn1] The Temple of Solomon the King,2[part0023.html#chap3-fn2] and in a number of other recent publications which thereader is encouraged to research. To help put things in historical perspective,I offer the following brief review of the events that surrounded the receptionof The Book of the Law.In 1903 Crowley had all but suspended magical workings and had taken his newwife Rose3 [part0023.html#chap3-fn3] on an extended honeymoon to a score ofexotic locations including Ceylon and Egypt. In December they discovered Rosewas pregnant. Rather than returning to their cold home in Scotland, they choseto travel back to Cairo where the weather was pleasant. Assuming romanticidentities, they checked into their hotel apartment as Prince Chioa Khan (Beast)and Princess Ouarda (Rose) and settled in.Perhaps out of boredom, Crowley performed the “Preliminary Invocation of theGoetia,” purposing to show Rose the sylphs. (It must be remembered that Rose hadno training or interest in magick.) She did not see the sylphs but instead fellinto a “strange state of mind.” She began repeating as if in a trance, “They arewaiting for you…it is all about the Child…All Osiris.”4[part0023.html#chap3-fn4]She then informed her husband that the God Horus was angry with him for ignoringHim. Irritated by what he at first thought was Rose's childish behavior, Crowleybegan to interrogate her as to the technical attributes of this “God.” To hisgreat surprise, Rose, who had absolutely no knowledge of Egyptology or Magick,answered even the most technical and esoteric questions with 100 percentaccuracy.The next day they visited Cairo's Boulak museum. It was Crowley's intention thatRose point out this God who wanted to talk with him. He sniggered as she ignoredand passed by the most common images of Horus, but he was quite surprised whenshe excitedly identified an obscure wooden funeral stélé of the Twenty-fifthDynasty as the source of her communications. Even more stunning was the museumexhibit number…666. Crowley could not ignore this curious chain of events. Hehad the stélé reproduced and began systematically working with Rose as hismagical assistant. (See color images, front and back covers.)5[part0023.html#chap3-fn5]Space forbids us to detail what followed, and the reader is again referred tothe previously mentioned texts. Suffice to say, that through Rose's unexpectedmediumship, contact was established with a praeter human intelligence callingitself Aiwass, a messenger of Hoor-Paar-Kraat,6 [part0023.html#chap3-fn6] whoannounced the Equinox of Gods (the changing of the age) and the intention of the“gods” to use Crowley to receive a book that was to be the fundamentalrevelation of the new age.On March 20, 1904, Crowley performed the Supreme Invocation of Horus whichformally initiated the Aeon of Horus. Per instructions, between noon and oneo'clock on April 8, 9, and 10, he entered the same temple, sat down at a writingtable, and wrote what was dictated to him by an audible voice. The results ofthese three hours of dictation are the three chapters of The Book of the Law.The reader is neither asked nor expected to believe the story. Each must judgefor himself or herself the value of the book. As I mentioned earlier, it is afundamental proscription of the text to offer to interpret or even discuss TheBook of the Law. It is entirely up to each of us to fathom its meaning inrelationship to our individual lives.Note: The reader will notice that Liber AL vel Legis is designated as apublication in Class A. Crowley originally categorized works which are “Officialpublications of A images [../images/00010.jpeg] A images [../images/00010.jpeg]”into four7 [part0023.html#chap3-fn7] classifications:1) Class A consists of books that may be changed not so much as the style of aletter: that is, they represent the utterance of an adept entirely beyond thecriticism of even the Visible Head of the Organization.2) Class B consists of books or essays that are the result of ordinaryscholarship, enlightened and earnest.3) Class C consists of matter that is to be regarded rather as suggestive thananything else.4) Class D consists of the official rituals and instructions.Some publications are composite, and pertain to more one class.8[part0023.html#chap3-fn8] The Thelemic rituals which are the subject of thisbook are Class D.

So she answered him, bending down, a lambent flame of blue,all-touching, all penetrant, her lovely hands upon the black earth, & her lithebody arched for love, and her soft feet not hurting the little flowers: Thouknowest! And the sign shall be my ecstasy, the consciousness of the continuityof existence, the omnipresence of my body.27. Then the priest answered & said unto the Queen of Space, kissing her lovelybrows, and the dew of her light bathing his whole body in a sweet-smellingperfume of sweat: O Nuit, continuous one of Heaven, let it be ever thus; thatmen speak not of Thee as One but as None; and let them speak not of thee at all,since thou art continuous!28. None, breathed the light, faint & fœry, of the stars, and two.29. For I am divided for love's sake, for the chance of union.30. This is the creation of the world, that the pain of division is as nothing,and the joy of dissolution all.31. For these fools of men and their woes care not thou at all! They feellittle; what is, is balanced by weak joys; but ye are my chosen ones.32. Obey my prophet! follow out the ordeals of my knowledge! seek me only! Thenthe joys of my love will redeem ye from all pain. This is so: I swear it by thevault of my body; by my sacred heart and tongue; by all I can give, by all Idesire of ye all.33. Then the priest fell into a deep trance or swoon, & said unto the Queen ofHeaven; Write unto us the ordeals; write unto us the rituals; write unto us thelaw!34. But she said: the ordeals I write not: the rituals shall be half known andhalf concealed: the Law is for all.35. This that thou writest is the threefold book of Law.36. My scribe Ankh-af-na-khonsu, the priest of the princes, shall not in oneletter change this book; but lest there be folly, he shall comment thereupon bythe wisdom of Ra-Hoor-Khu-it.37. Also the mantras and spells; the obeah and the wanga; the work of the wandand the work of the sword; these he shall learn and teach.38. He must teach; but he may make severe the ordeals.39. The word of the Law is θελημα.40. Who calls us Thelemites will do no wrong, if he look but close into theword. For there are therein Three Grades, the Hermit, and the Lover, and the manof Earth. Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.41. The word of Sin is Restriction. O man! refuse not thy wife, if she will! Olover, if thou wilt, depart! There is no bond that can unite the divided butlove: all else is a curse. Accurséd! Accurséd! be it to the æons! Hell.42. Let it be that state of manyhood bound and loathing. So with thy all; thouhast no right but to do thy will.43. Do that, and no other shall say nay.44. For pure will, unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of result, isevery way perfect.45. The Perfect and the Perfect are one Perfect and not two; nay, are none!46. Nothing is a secret key of this law. Sixty-one the Jews call it; I call iteight, eighty, four hundred & eighteen.47. But they have the half: unite by thine art so that all disappear.48. My prophet is a fool with his one, one, one; are not they the Ox, and noneby the Book?49. Abrogate are all rituals, all ordeals, all words and signs. Ra-Hoor-Khuithath taken his seat in the East at the Equinox of the Gods; and let Asar be withIsa, who also are one. But they are not of me. Let Asar be the adorant, Isa thesufferer; Hoor in his secret name and splendour is the Lord initiating.50. There is a word to say about the Hierophantic task. Behold! There are threeordeals in one, and it may be given in three ways. The gross must pass throughfire; let the fine be tried in intellect, and the lofty chosen ones in thehighest. Thus ye have star & star, system & system; let not one know well theother!51. There are four gates to one palace; the floor of that palace is of silverand gold; lapis lazuli & jasper are there; and all rare scents; jasmine & rose,and the emblems of death. Let him enter in turn or at once the four gates; lethim stand on the floor of the palace. Will he not sink? Amn. Ho! warrior, if thyservant sink? But there are means and means. Be goodly therefore: dress ye allin fine apparel; eat rich foods and drink sweet wines and wines that foam! Also,take your fill and will of love as ye will, when, where and with whom ye will!But always unto me.52. If this be not aright; if ye confound the space-marks, saying: They are one;or saying, They are many; if the ritual be not ever unto me: then expect thedireful judgments of Ra-Hoor-Khuit!53. This shall regenerate the world, the little world my sister, my heart & mytongue, unto whom I send this kiss. Also, o scribe and prophet, though thou beof the princes, it shall not assuage thee nor absolve thee. But ecstasy be thineand joy of earth: ever To me! To me!54. Change not as much as the style of a letter; for behold! thou, o prophetshalt not behold all these mysteries hidden therein.55. The child of thy bowels, he shall behold them.56. Expect him not from the East, nor from the West; for from no expected housecometh that child. Aum! All words are sacred and all prophets true; save onlythat they understand a little; solve the first half of the equation, leave thesecond unattacked. But thou hast all in the clear light, and some, though notall, in the dark.57. Invoke me under my stars! Love is the law, love under will. Nor let thefools mistake love; for there are love and love. There is the dove, and there isthe serpent. Choose ye well! He, my prophet, hath chosen, knowing the law of thefortress, and the great mystery of the House of God.All these old letters of my Book are aright; but images [../images/00012.jpeg]is not the Star. This also is secret: my prophet shall reveal it to the wise.58. I give unimaginable joys on earth: certainty, not faith, while in life, upondeath; peace unutterable, rest, ecstasy; nor do I demand aught in sacrifice.59. My incense is of resinous woods & gums; and there is no blood therein:because of my hair the trees of Eternity.60. My number is 11, as all their numbers who are of us. The Five Pointed Star,with a Circle in the Middle, & the circle is Red. My colour is black to theblind, but the blue & gold are seen of the seeing. Also I have a secret gloryfor them that love me.61. But to love me is better than all things: if under the night-stars in thedesert thou presently burnest mine incense before me, invoking me with a pureheart, and the Serpent flame therein, thou shalt come a little to lie in mybosom. For one kiss wilt thou then be willing to give all; but whoso gives oneparticle of dust shall lose all in that hour. Ye shall gather goods and store ofwomen and spices; ye shall wear rich jewels; ye shall exceed the nations of theearth in splendour & pride; but always in the love of me, and so shall ye cometo my joy. I charge you earnestly to come before me in a single robe, andcovered with a rich headdress. I love you! I yearn to you! Pale or purple,veiled or voluptuous, I who am all pleasure and purple, and drunkenness of theinnermost sense, desire you. Put on the wings, and arouse the coiled splendourwithin you: come unto me!62. At all my meetings with you shall the priestess say—and her eyes shall burnwith desire as she stands bare and rejoicing in my secret temple—To me! To me!calling forth the flame of the hearts of all in her love-chant.63. Sing the rapturous love-song unto me! Burn to me perfumes! Wear to mejewels! Drink to me, for I love you! I love you!64. I am the blue-lidded daughter of Sunset; I am the naked brilliance of thevoluptuous night-sky.65. To me! To me!66. The Manifestation of Nuit is at an end.images [../images/00013.jpeg]1. Nu! the hiding of Hadit.2. Come! all ye, and learn the secret that hath not yet been revealed. I, Hadit,am the complement of Nu, my bride. I am not extended, and Khabs is the name ofmy House.3. In the sphere I am everywhere the centre, as she, the circumference, isnowhere found.4. Yet she shall be known & I never.5. Behold! the rituals of the old time are black. Let the evil ones be castaway; let the good ones be purged by the prophet! Then shall this Knowledge goaright.6. I am the flame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core of everystar. I am Life, and the giver of Life, yet therefore is the knowledge of me theknowledge of death.7. I am the Magician and the Exorcist. I am the axle of the wheel, and the cubein the circle. “Come unto me” is a foolish word: for it is I that go.8. Who worshipped Heru-pa-kraath have worshipped me; ill, for I am theworshipper.9. Remember all ye that existence is pure joy; that all the sorrows are but asshadows; they pass & are done; but there is that which remains.10. O prophet! thou hast ill will to learn this writing.11. I see thee hate the hand & the pen; but I am stronger.12. Because of me in Thee which thou knewest not.13. for why? Because thou wast the knower, and me.14. Now let there be a veiling of this shrine: now let the light devour men andeat them up with blindness!15. For I am perfect, being Not; and my number is nine by the fools; but withthe just I am eight, and one in eight: Which is vital, for I am none indeed. TheEmpress and the King are not of me; for there is a further secret.16. I am The Empress & the Hierophant. Thus eleven, as my bride is eleven.17. Hear me, ye people of sighing!The sorrows of pain and regretAre left to the dead and the dying,The folk that not know me as yet.18. These are dead, these fellows; they feel not. We are not for the poor andsad: the lords of the earth are our kinsfolk.19. Is a God to live in a dog? No! but the highest are of us. They shallrejoice, our chosen: who sorroweth is not of us.20. Beauty and strength, leaping laughter and delicious languor, force and fire,are of us.21. We have nothing with the outcast and the unfit: let them die in theirmisery. For they feel not. Compassion is the vice of kings: stamp down thewretched & the weak: this is the law of the strong: this is our law and the joyof the world. Think not, o king, upon that lie: That Thou Must Die: verily thoushalt not die, but live. Now let it be understood: If the body of the Kingdissolve, he shall remain in pure ecstasy for ever. Nuit! Hadit! Ra-Hoor-Khuit!The Sun, Strength & Sight, Light; these are for the servants of the Star & theSnake.22. I am the Snake that giveth Knowledge & Delight and bright glory, and stirthe hearts of men with drunkenness. To worship me take wine and strange drugswhereof I will tell my prophet, & be drunk thereof—They shall not harm ye atall. It is a lie, this folly against self. The exposure of innocence is a lie.Be strong, O man! lust, enjoy all things of sense and rapture: fear not that anyGod shall deny thee for this.23. I am alone: there is no God where I am.24. Behold! these be grave mysteries; for there are also of my friends who behermits. Now think not to find them in the forest or on the mountain; but inbeds of purple, caressed by magnificent beasts of women with large limbs, andfire and light in their eyes, and masses of flaming hair about them; there shallye find them. Ye shall see them at rule, at victorious armies, at all the joy;and there shall be in them a joy a million times greater than this. Beware lestany force another, King against King! Love one another with burning hearts; onthe low men trample in the fierce lust of your pride, in the day of your wrath.25. Ye are against the people, O my chosen!26. I am the secret Serpent coiled about to spring: in my coiling there is joy.If I lift up my head, I and my Nuit are one. If I droop down mine head, andshoot forth venom, then is rapture of the earth, and I and the earth are one.27. There is great danger in me; for who doth not understand these runes shallmake a great miss. He shall fall down into the pit called Because, and there heshall perish with the dogs of Reason.28. Now a curse upon Because and his kin!29. May Because be accursèd for ever!30. If Will stops and cries Why, invoking Because, then Will stops & doesnought.31. If Power asks why, then is Power weakness.32. Also reason is a lie; for there is a factor infinite & unknown; & all theirwords are skew-wise.33. Enough of Because! Be he damned for a dog!34. But ye, o my people, rise up & awake!35. Let the rituals be rightly performed with joy & beauty!36. There are rituals of the elements and feasts of the times.37. A feast for the first night of the Prophet and his Bride!38. A feast for the three days of the writing of the Book of the Law.39. A feast for Tahuti and the child of the Prophet—secret O Prophet!40. A feast for the Supreme Ritual, and a feast for the Equinox of the Gods.41. A feast for fire and a feast for water; a feast for life and a greater feastfor death!42. A feast every day in your hearts in the joy of my rapture!43. A feast every night unto Nu, and the pleasure of uttermost delight!44. Aye! feast! rejoice! there is no dread hereafter. There is the dissolution,and eternal ecstasy in the kisses of Nu.45. There is death for the dogs.46. Dost thou fail? Art thou sorry? Is fear in thine heart?47. Where I am these are not.48. Pity not the fallen! I never knew them. I am not for them. I console not: Ihate the consoled & the consoler.49. I am unique & conqueror. I am not of the slaves that perish. Be they damned& dead! Amen. (This is of the 4: there is a fifth who is invisible, & therein amI as a babe in an egg.)50. Blue am I and gold in the light of my bride: but the red gleam is in myeyes; & my spangles are purple & green.51. Purple beyond purple: it is the light higher than eyesight.52. There is a veil: that veil is black. It is the veil of the modest woman; itis the veil of sorrow, & the pall of death: this is none of me. Tear down thatlying spectre of the centuries: veil not your vices in virtuous words: thesevices are my service; ye do well, & I will reward you here and hereafter.53. Fear not, o prophet, when these words are said, thou shalt not be sorry.Thou art emphatically my chosen; and blessed are the eyes that thou shalt lookupon with gladness. But I will hide thee in a mask of sorrow: they that see theeshall fear thou art fallen: but I lift thee up.54. Nor shall they who cry aloud their folly that thou meanest nought avail;thou shall reveal it: thou availest: they are the slaves of because: They arenot of me. The stops as thou wilt; the letters? change them not in style orvalue!55. Thou shalt obtain the order & value of the English Alphabet; thou shalt findnew symbols to attribute them unto.56. Begone! ye mockers; even though ye laugh in my honour ye shall laugh notlong: then when ye are sad know that I have forsaken you.57. He that is righteous shall be righteous still; he that is filthy shall befilthy still.58. Yea! deem not of change: ye shall be as ye are, & not other. Therefore thekings of the earth shall be Kings for ever: the slaves shall serve. There isnone that shall be cast down or lifted up: all is ever as it was. Yet there aremasked ones my servants: it may be that yonder beggar is a King. A King maychoose his garment as he will: there is no certain test: but a beggar cannothide his poverty.59. Beware therefore! Love all, lest perchance is a King concealed! Say you so?Fool! If he be a King, thou canst not hurt him.60. Therefore strike hard & low, and to hell with them, master!61. There is a light before thine eyes, o prophet, a light undesired, mostdesirable.62. I am uplifted in thine heart; and the kisses of the stars rain hard upon thybody.63. Thou art exhaust in the voluptuous fullness of the inspiration; theexpiration is sweeter than death, more rapid and laughterful than a caress ofHell's own worm.64. Oh! thou art overcome: we are upon thee; our delight is all over thee: hail!hail: prophet of Nu! prophet of Had! prophet of Ra-Hoor-Khu! Now rejoice! nowcome in our splendour & rapture! Come in our passionate peace, & write sweetwords for the Kings!65. I am the Master: thou art the Holy Chosen One.66. Write, & find ecstasy in writing! Work, & be our bed in working! Thrill withthe joy of life & death! Ah! thy death shall be lovely: whoso seeth it shall beglad. Thy death shall be the seal of the promise of our agelong love. Come! liftup thine heart & rejoice! We are one; we are none.67. Hold! Hold! Bear up in thy rapture; fall not in swoon of the excellentkisses!68. Harder! Hold up thyself—Lift thine head! breathe not so deep—die!69. Ah! Ah! What do I feel? Is the word exhausted?70. There is help & hope in other spells. Wisdom says: be strong! Then canstthou bear more joy. Be not animal; refine thy rapture! If thou drink, drink bythe eight and ninety rules of art: if thou love, exceed by delicacy; and if thoudo aught joyous, let there be subtlety therein!71. But exceed! exceed!72. Strive ever to more! and if thou art truly mine—and doubt it not, an if thouart ever joyous!—death is the crown of all.73. Ah! Ah! Death! Death! thou shalt long for death. Death is forbidden, o man,unto thee.74. The length of thy longing shall be the strength of its glory. He that liveslong & desires death much is ever the King among the Kings.75. Aye! listen to the numbers & the words:76. 4 6 3 8 A B K 2 4 A L G M O R 3 Y X 24 89 R P S T O V A L.What meaneth this, o prophet? Thou knowest not; nor shalt thou know ever. Therecometh one to follow thee: he shall expound it. But remember, o chosen one, tobe me; to follow the love of Nu in the star-lit heaven; to look forth upon men,to tell them this glad word.77. O be thou proud and mighty among men!78. Lift up thyself! for there is none like unto thee among men or among Gods!Lift up thyself, o my prophet, thy stature shall surpass the stars. They shallworship thy name foursquare, mystic, wonderful, the number of the man; and thename of thy house 418.79. The end of the hiding of Hadit; and blessing & worship to the prophet of thelovely Star!images [../images/00013.jpeg]1. Abrahadabra! the reward of Ra-Hoor-Khut.2. There is division hither homeward; there is a word not known. Spelling isdefunct; all is not aught. Beware! Hold! Raise the spell of Ra-Hoor-Kuit!3. Now let it be first understood that I am a god of War and of Vengeance. Ishall deal hardly with them.4. Choose ye an island!5. Fortify it!6. Dung it about with enginery of war!7. I will give you a war-engine.8. With it ye shall smite the peoples; and none shall stand before you.9. Lurk! Withdraw! Upon them! this is the Law of the Battle of Conquest: thusshall my worship be about my secret house.10. Get the stélé of revealing itself; set it in thy secret temple—and thattemple is already aright disposed—& it shall be your Kiblah for ever. It shallnot fade, but miraculous colour shall come back to it day after day. Close it inlocked glass for a proof to the world.11. This shall be your only proof. I forbid argument. Conquer! That is enough. Iwill make easy to you the abstruction from the ill-ordered house in theVictorious City. Thou shalt thyself convey it with worship, o prophet, thoughthou likest it not. Thou shalt have danger & trouble. Ra-Hoor-Khu is with thee.Worship me with fire & blood; worship me with swords & with spears. Let thewoman be girt with a sword before me: let blood flow to my name. Trample downthe Heathen; be upon them, o warrior, I will give you of their flesh to eat!12. Sacrifice cattle, little and big: after a child.13. But not now.14. Ye shall see that hour, o blessèd Beast, and thou the Scarlet Concubine ofhis desire!15. Ye shall be sad thereof.16. Deem not too eagerly to catch the promises; fear not to undergo the curses.Ye, even ye, know not this meaning all.17. Fear not at all; fear neither men nor Fates, nor gods, nor anything. Moneyfear not, nor laughter of the folk folly, nor any other power in heaven or uponthe earth or under the earth. Nu is your refuge as Hadit your light; and I amthe strength, force, vigour, of your arms.18. Mercy let be off: damn them who pity! Kill and torture; spare not; be uponthem!19. That stélé they shall call the Abomination of Desolation; count well itsname, & it shall be to you as 718.20. Why? Because of the fall of Because, that he is not there again.21. Set up my image in the East: thou shalt buy thee an image which I will showthee, especial, not unlike the one thou knowest. And it shall be suddenly easyfor thee to do this.22. The other images group around me to support me: let all be worshipped, forthey shall cluster to exalt me. I am the visible object of worship; the othersare secret; for the Beast & his Bride are they: and for the winners of theOrdeal x. What is this? Thou shalt know.23. For perfume mix meal & honey & thick leavings of red wine: then oil ofAbramelin and olive oil, and afterward soften & smooth down with rich freshblood.24. The best blood is of the moon, monthly: then the fresh blood of a child, ordropping from the host of heaven: then of enemies; then of the priest or of theworshippers: last of some beast, no matter what.25. This burn: of this make cakes & eat unto me. This hath also another use; letit be laid before me, and kept thick with perfumes of your orison: it shallbecome full of beetles as it were and creeping things sacred unto me.26. These slay, naming your enemies; & they shall fall before you.27. Also these shall breed lust & power of lust in you at the eating thereof.28. Also ye shall be strong in war.29. Moreover, be they long kept, it is better; for they swell with my force. Allbefore me.30. My altar is of open brass work: burn thereon in silver or gold!31. There cometh a rich man from the West who shall pour his gold upon thee.32. From gold forge steel!33. Be ready to fly or to smite!34. But your holy place shall be untouched throughout the centuries: though withfire and sword it be burnt down & shattered, yet an invisible house therestandeth, and shall stand until the fall of the Great Equinox; when Hrumachisshall arise and the double-wanded one assume my throne and place. Anotherprophet shall arise, and bring fresh fever from the skies; another woman shallawake the lust & worship of the Snake; another soul of God and beast shallmingle in the globèd priest; another sacrifice shall stain the tomb; anotherking shall reign; and blessing no longer be poured To the Hawk-headed mysticalLord!35. The half of the word of Heru-ra-ha, called Hoor-pa-kraat and Ra-Hoor-Khut.36. Then said the prophet unto the God:37. I adore thee in the song—I am the Lord of Thebes, and IThe inspired forth-speaker of Mentu;For me unveils the veilèd sky,The self-slain Ankh-af-na-khonsuWhose words are truth. I invoke, I greetThy presence, O Ra-Hoor-Khuit!Unity uttermost showed!I adore the might of Thy breath,Supreme and terrible God,Who makest the gods and deathTo tremble before Thee:—I, I adore thee!Appear on the throne of Ra!Open the ways of the Khu!Lighten the ways of the Ka!The ways of the Khabs run throughTo stir me or still me!Aum! let it fill me!38. So that thy light is in me; & its red flame is as a sword in my hand to pushthy order. There is a secret door that I shall make to establish thy way in allthe quarters, (these are the adorations, as thou hast written), as it is said:The light is mine; its rays consumeMe: I have made a secret doorInto the House of Ra and Tum,Of Kephra and of Ahathoor.I am thy Theban, O Mentu,The prophet Ankh-af-na-khonsu!By Bes-na-Maut my breast I beat;By wise Ta-Nech I weave my spell.Show thy star-splendour, O Nuit!Bid me within thine House to dwell,O wingèd snake of light, Hadit!Abide with me, Ra-Hoor-Khuit!39. All this and a book to say how thou didst come hither and a reproduction ofthis ink and paper for ever—for in it is the word secret & not only in theEnglish—and thy comment upon this the Book of the Law shall be printedbeautifully in red ink and black upon beautiful paper made by hand; and to eachman and woman that thou meetest, were it but to dine or to drink at them, it isthe Law to give. Then they shall chance to abide in this bliss or no; it is noodds. Do this quickly!40. But the work of the comment? That is easy; and Hadit burning in thy heartshall make swift and secure thy pen.41. Establish at thy Kaaba a clerk-house: all must be done well and withbusiness way.42. The ordeals thou shalt oversee thyself, save only the blind ones. Refusenone, but thou shalt know & destroy the traitors. I am Ra-Hoor-Khuit; and I ampowerful to protect my servant. Success is thy proof: argue not; convert not;talk not over much! Them that seek to entrap thee, to overthrow thee, themattack without pity or quarter; & destroy them utterly. Swift as a troddenserpent turn and strike! Be thou yet deadlier than he! Drag down their souls toawful torment: laugh at their fear: spit upon them!43. Let the Scarlet Woman beware! If pity and compassion and tenderness visither heart; if she leave my work to toy with old sweetnesses; then shall myvengeance be known. I will slay me her child: I will alienate her heart: I willcast her out from men: as a shrinking and despised harlot shall she crawlthrough dusk wet streets, and die cold and an-hungered.44. But let her raise herself in pride! Let her follow me in my way! Let herwork the work of wickedness! Let her kill her heart! Let her be loud andadulterous! Let her be covered with jewels, and rich garments, and let her beshameless before all men!45. Then will I lift her to pinnacles of power: then will I breed from her achild mightier than all the kings of the earth. I will fill her with joy: withmy force shall she see & strike at the worship of Nu: she shall achieve Hadit.46. I am the warrior Lord of the Forties: the Eighties cower before me, & areabased. I will bring you to victory & joy. I will be at your arms in battle & yeshall delight to slay. Success is your proof; courage is your armour; go on, goon, in my strength; & ye shall turn not back for any!47. This book shall be translated into all tongues: but always with the originalin the writing of the Beast; for in the chance shape of the letters and theirposition to one another: in these are mysteries that no Beast shall divine. Lethim not seek to try: but one cometh after him, whence I say not, who shalldiscover the Key of it all. Then this line drawn is a key: then this circlesquared in its failure is a key also. And Abrahadabra. It shall be his child &that strangely. Let him not seek after this; for thereby alone can he fall fromit.48. Now this mystery of the letters is done, and I want to go on to the holierplace.49. I am in a secret fourfold word, the blasphemy against all gods of men.50. Curse them! Curse them! Curse them!51. With my Hawk's head I peck at the eyes of Jesus as he hangs upon the cross.52. I flap my wings in the face of Mohammed & blind him.53. With my claws I tear out the flesh of the Indian and the Buddhist, Mongoland Din.54. Bahlasti! Ompehda! I spit on your crapulous creeds.55. Let Mary inviolate be torn upon wheels: for her sake let all chaste women beutterly despised among you!56. Also for beauty's sake and love's!57. Despise also all cowards; professional soldiers who dare not fight, butplay; all fools despise!58. But the keen and the proud, the royal and the lofty; ye are brothers!59. As brothers fight ye!60. There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt.61. There is an end of the word of the God enthroned in Ra's seat, lighteningthe girders of the soul.62. To Me do ye reverence! to me come ye through tribulation of ordeal, which isbliss.63. The fool readeth this Book of the Law, and its comment; & he understandethit not.64. Let him come through the first ordeal, & it will be to him as silver.65. Through the second, gold.66. Through the third, stones of precious water.67. Through the fourth, ultimate sparks of the intimate fire.68. Yet to all it shall seem beautiful. Its enemies who say not so, are mereliars.69. There is success.70. I am the Hawk-Headed Lord of Silence & of Strength; my nemyss shrouds thenight-blue sky.71. Hail! ye twin warriors about the pillars of the world! for your time is nighat hand.72. I am the Lord of the Double Wand of Power; the wand of the Force of CophNia—but my left hand is empty, for I crushed an Universe; & nought remains.73. Paste the sheets from right to left and from top to bottom: then behold!74. There is a splendour in my name hidden and glorious, as the sun of midnightis ever the son.75.

Wouldst thou abuse the pure beings of the woods and mountains tofill thy coffers and satisfy thy hunger of Gold? Wouldst thou debase the Spiritsof Living Fire to serve thy wrath and hatred?Wouldst thou violate the purity of the Souls of the Waters to pander to thy lustof debauchery? Whouldst thou force the Spirits of the Evening Breeze to ministerto thy folly and caprice? Know that with such desires thou canst but attract theWeak, not the Strong, and in that case the Weak will have power over thee.—LIBER LIBRAEThe first task of the magician is to master his or her immediate environment.“If thou thyself hast not a sure foundation, whereon wilt thou stand to directthe forces of Nature?”1 [part0023.html#chap4-fn1] On the mundane plane thismeans the ability to provide materially for yourself (and your family if that isyour situation) in such a manner as to allow you to also pursue your spiritualdisciplines. This is no mean task, and I doff my magical cap to anyone who canachieve such a lifestyle.Our immediate environment is the phenomenal universe, the microcosm, the “littleuniverse,” of which the mental world forms the foundation. The key to themastery of this world is the Pentagram.Obviously the “magical” elements are not those that appear on the periodic tableof elements of modern chemistry (although they could be called the buildingblocks of matter). Neither are they fire, water, air, and earth as is commonlyunderstood (although their fundamental nature are manifested perfectly in theirliteral counterparts).Perhaps the simplest way for us to understand elements is to think of them asthe sum of all energies, powers and properties of the universe categorized bycharacteristics into four general classes: Fire, Water, Air, and Earth.For example, if a modern physicist were to use the picturesque language of theancients to describe the four fundamental forces of nature, he might say thestrong force is Fire, the electromagnetic force is Water, the weak force is Air,and the gravitational force is Earth. Or the chemist might classify nitrogen,hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon in the same order because of the characteristicsthese elements exhibit.The Qabalist (and consequently the Magician) sees the elements as reflections ofthe four qabalistic worlds2 [part0023.html#chap4-fn2] and the four letters ofthe Tetragrammaton IHVH, (images [../images/00016.jpeg])—Yod, the Father-Fire;Heh, the Mother-Water; Vau, the Son-Air; and Heh (final), the Daughter-Earth.These in turn are represented in the tarot as the four suits: Wands-Fire,Cups-Water, Swords-Air, and Disks-Earth.The reader may be asking at this point why the Pentagram, a five pointed figure,would be the key to the mastery of the four Elements. The answer lies in thedual operation performed by a “quintessential” fifth element. This element issimultaneously responsible for 1) binding the other elements together to formthe infinite variety of the universe, and 2) keeping them separated enough tomaintain their essential individual characteristics (see figure 1[part0013.html#fig1], page 53 [part0013.html#page_53]). This fifth element isknown in Western Hermeticism as Spirit, and the Qabalists represent it by theletter Shin (images [../images/00017.jpeg]). When inserted in the ineffable nameIHVH (Jehovah) it becomes IHShVH (Jeheshua). We will later see how this dualnature of Spirit manifests as two types of Pentagram, active and passive.images [../images/00018.jpeg]Figure 1. The PentagramThe perpetual combination and recombination of these elements is the veryprocess of “creation.” From the very beginning of the magician's career, he orshe must consciously take part in this divine juggling3[part0023.html#chap4-fn3] act and endeavor to correct any elemental imbalance inhis or her life. This is not easy; but without this fundamental balance, we cannever hope to successfully conquer what lies beyond the world of the elements.To reconcile the magical formulae of the classic Pentagram rituals with those ofthe Aeon of Horus, Crowley designed two rituals: Liber XXV,4[part0023.html#chap4-fn4] The Star Ruby and Liber V vel Reguli. Both ceremoniesare short and simple in construction, and can be memorized and performed almostimmediately. The beginning student, however, is encouraged to be intimatelyfamiliar with the traditional Pentagram rituals before exclusively adoptingthese two ceremonies as his or her own. The reasons should be obvious.1) Like every Thelemic Ritual we will discuss the components of the Star Rubyand Reguli (God names, gestures, words, signs, etc.) conform to the formulae ofthe new aeon. These, as we have discussed above, evolved from the formulae ofthe previous aeons. If the magician does not have a basic grasp of the oldformulae there is little chance he or she will understand the subtleties of thenew.2) To successfully invoke or banish the various elements, the magician needs toknow how to correctly “draw” twelve different Pentagrams: one each to banish andinvoke each of the four elements, and one each to banish and invoke each of thetwo varieties (active and passive) of Spirit (see figure 2 [part0013.html#fig2],below). To be prepared to wield the power of the Pentagram in the rituals of theStar Ruby and Reguli, it is absolutely necessary that the magician have a totaland unambiguous mastery and understanding of these twelve diagrams.As you can see, a simple rule of thumb is invoke toward and banish away from theelement in question.For practical workings these Pentagrams must not only be memorized but imprintedfirmly upon the unconscious mind. It is not an exaggeration to warn that youmust be able to draw the appropriate Pentagrams in your sleep—for once you haveseriously embarked upon magical practices, you may be called upon to do justthat.Those familiar with the tarot will recall that, in traditional decks, the fourKerubic Beasts of Ezekiel are placed in exactly the same positions in thecorners of The Wheel of Fortune and the World cards. The Lion (Leo-Fire) in thelower right-hand corner, the Eagle (Scorpio-Water) in the upper right-handcorner, the Man (Aquarius-Air) in the upper left hand corner, and the Bull(Taurus-Earth) in the lower left-hand corner. When first studying the Pentagramit is helpful to visually create the Wheel of Fortune card in the mind's eye andsimply “draw” the appropriate star upon it, rather than trying to memorize allthe varieties of Pentagram.images [../images/00019.jpeg]Figure 2. Invoking and Banishing PentagramsIn the Star Ruby, Crowley assumes that the magician has mastered all thePentagrams so thoroughly that he or she can simply create a Pentagram “…arightin thy forehead” and hurl it toward the appropriate quarter. It is onlyreasonable to conclude that if you aren't truly the master of the Pentagram, thestar you hurl forth from your forehead will be anemic and ineffectual. Toprepare for such command of the elements it is necessary to memorize and perfectthe two fundamental rituals from which the Star Ruby and Reguli are derived; theLesser Ritual of the Pentagram, and the Greater Ritual of the Pentagram. Themagical education these two ceremonies provide is the key to the power of theThelemic rituals which follow.The Lesser Ritual of the PentagramCrowley had great respect for the simple Pentagram ritual. In a footnote toPalace of the World,5 [part0023.html#chap4-fn5] he wrote the following:Those who regard this ritual as a mere device to invoke or banish spirits, areunworthy to possess it. Properly understood, it is the Medicine of Metals andthe Stone of the Wise.The Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram should proceed any magical working ordivinatory exercise. It is the magical equivalent of cleaning, vacuuming, anddusting the temple before operating. Only one type of Pentagram is used(Banishing Earth), and the ceremony is very brief. It provides, perhaps for thefirst time, the opportunity for the magician to create a magical environment.This simple ritual is useful in many other ways as well. It grounds the magicianand establishes a protective circle of operation. If done regularly the magicianwill develop his or her powers of visualization and concentration by drawing thePentagrams and invoking the archangelic guardians.Note: The direction in which the Magician moves in a ritual is very important.The basic rule of thumb is: move with the Sun (clockwise) to invoke, moveagainst the Sun (counter-clockwise) to banish. Clockwise is referred to asdeosil, and counter-clockwise is called widdershins. Although the above formulais never abrogated, there are many rituals which appear, at first glance, toignore the rules. Even the simple Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagraminstructs the magician to move deosil around the circle. A little meditationupon this seeming contradiction will reveal to the student that the fourquarters are properly banished by drawing the Banishing Earth Pentagrams, butthe circle remains sealed and guarded by the four archangels who are invokedinto their places by the deosil movement of the magician.In more complex rituals, the logic behind the dictated direction of movementwill be harder to fathom, but it is very important for each magician to reasonout to his or her satisfaction the “method” behind the “madness.” THE LESSER RITUALOF THEPENTAGRAM6 [part0023.html#chap4-fn6]images [../images/00020.jpeg]Banishing Earth Pentagram 1.

Signs of the Grades (continued).VIBRATION OF THE DIVINE NAMESOnce the Lesser Banishing ritual of the Pentagram has been committed to memorythe magician should then learn to “vibrate” the Divine Names in the quartersrather than simply say them. Crowley gave detailed instructions in Part III ofLiber O from which we quote:a) Stand with arms outstretched.10 [part0023.html#chap4-fn10]b) Breathe in deeply through the nostrils, imagining the name of the God desiredentering with the breath.c) Let that name descend slowly from the lungs to the heart, the solar plexus,the navel, the generative organs, and so to the feet.d) The moment that it appears to touch the feet, quickly advance the left footabout 12 inches, throw forward the body, and let the hands (drawn back to theside of the eyes) shoot out, so that you are standing in the typical position ofthe God Horus,11 [part0023.html#chap4-fn11] and at the same time imagine theName as rushing up and through the body, while you breathe it out through thenostrils with the air which has been till then retained in the lungs. All thismust be done with all the force of which your are capable.e) Then withdraw the left foot, and place the right forefinger12[part0023.html#chap4-fn12] upon the lips, so that you are in the characteristicposition of the God Harpocrates.f) It is a sign that the student is performing this correctly when a single“Vibration” entirely exhausts his physical strength. It should cause him to growhot all over or to perspire violently, and it should so weaken him that he willfind it difficult to remain standing.It is a sign of success, though only by the student himself is it perceived,when he hears the name of God vehemently roared forth, as if by the concourse often thousand thunders; and it should appear to him as if that Great Voiceproceeded from the Universe, and not from himself.NOTES ON THE RITUAL OF THE PENTAGRAMby Aleister Crowleyimages [../images/00025.jpeg]You are supposed to be standing at the intersection of the paths of Samekh andPé. You are facing Tiphareth (the Sun), thus on your right hand is Netzach(Venus) on your left hand Hod (Mercury), and behind you Yesod (the Moon).You take one step with the right heel in the hollow of the left foot towardsTiphareth and vibrate the Divine Name as given in the ritual. You then carryround the point of the Wand towards Netzach, then take a step again (alwaysrecovering after each forward step so that you remain in the centre) andvibrating the Divine Name as before.Continue the process facing Yesod and vibrating; then Hod, and vibrating; butcarry the point of the Wand round to Tiphareth so as to complete the circle.As you vibrate the Divine Name the angels, as given in the ritual, appear, (notewell that they should appear and if the ritual is properly performed do appear).You are thus standing in a Column which is protected by your microcosmicinvocation. The consequent result, being macrocosmic response, is that withoutany effort on your part the hexagram or sixfold star appears both above andbelow you. (Note the equilibration 5 = 6.)In this way you are completely shut off from the outer and Qliphotic parts ofthe universe.Get well into your mind the realization of this Column with its surroundingpentagrams and its hexagrams above and below you. Continuous practice isessential if you are to perform this ritual as you should.It is particularly important not to slur any part of it; to visualize clearlyand cleanly the forces invoked, with the exception of the Divine Being, who willnot appear, in the ordinary course of events, for such slight cause.You can figure out for yourself the forms of the angels, or rather archangels.For instance, Raphael commencing with an “R” will have a head of solar glory andthe Pé which follows shows that the rest of him is martial: the “Al” whichconcludes the name (in the case of most angelic beings) indicates that theywield the sword and the balance.images [../images/00013.jpeg]Once the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram and the vibrations of the God Names havebeen perfected the student should then master all the variations13[part0023.html#chap4-fn13] of the Greater Ritual of the Pentagram. Unlike theLesser Pentagram Ritual which provides a simple cleansing and centeringfunction, this ceremony taps a far deeper strata of the elemental world and isthe key to the opening and closing of what is known as the Elemental Watchtowersof the Universe. The basic formula embodied in the Greater Ritual also providesthe fundamental knowledge necessary for the practice of other branches of theart, including Enochian Magick and Goetia.The version appearing below is the simplest format constructed from theinformation outlined in Crowley's Liber O. More elaborate versions utilizingadditional material such as Enochian words and the Kerubic symbols of the zodiaccan be found in numerous other texts, but I feel the student would be bestserved by mastering the essentials first.The first thing one notices about the Greater Pentagram Ritual is its similarityto the Lesser Ritual. It opens with the same Qabalistic Cross and ends with thesame invocation of the Archangels. But here the similarity ends.Each quarter is ruled by a different element (East-Air, South-Fire, West-Water,and North Earth14 [part0023.html#chap4-fn14]) and each is activated by twoPentagrams.The first is a Spirit Pentagram [an active Pentagram in the quarters of theactive elements of Air (East) and Fire (South); and a passive Pentagram in thequarters of the passive elements of Water (West) and Earth (North)]. Bycorrectly creating this Pentagram, the magician unlocks the door to theelemental universe and announces to the spiritual inhabitants of each quarterhis or her authority to command them.The second is the elemental Pentagram of the quarter (Air in the East, Fire inthe South, Water in the West, and Earth in the North). By correctly creatingthis Pentagram, the magician exercises that authority to either invoke or banishthe elemental spirits of the quarter.After each of these Pentagrams is “drawn,” the magician then symbolicallyproclaims his or her dominion of the quarter by making the proper sign orgesture appropriate to the element in question. These gestures (which aredescribed in the text of the ritual) are the characteristic Signs of the Gradesof the original Golden Dawn Degree structure (see figure 3c[part0013.html#fig3c] on page 61 [part0013.html#page_61]):(The Grade of the Portal, is particularly attributed to the element of Spirit;it refers to the Sun; the paths of Samech, Resh, and Tzaddi are attributed tothis degree. See “777” lines 6 and 31 bis).(The Grade of 4° = 7images [../images/00026.jpeg] is particularly attributed tothe element Fire; it refers to the Planet Venus; the paths of Qoph, Ayin and Péare attributed to this degree. For other attributions see “777” lines 7 and 31).(The Grade of 3° = 8images [../images/00026.jpeg] is particularly attributed tothe element of Water; it refers to the planet Mercury; the paths of Resh andShin are attributed to this degree. For other attributions see “777” lines 8 and23).(The Grade of 2° = 9images [../images/00026.jpeg] is particularly attributed tothe element Air; it refers to the Moon, the path of Tau is attributed to thisdegree. For other attributions see “777” lines 9 and 11).(The Grade of 1° = 10images [../images/00026.jpeg] is particularly attributed tothe element of Earth. See “777” lines 10 and 32 bis).15[part0023.html#chap4-fn15]It is important to always remember that, on the magical plane, symbols areliving things, and living things are symbols. Therefore it is essential that thesigns be made properly and with the full intent of the magician of transforminghis or her body into a living symbol. In the Greater Ritual of the Pentagram,these signs are indicative of the elements, but in more advanced rituals theycan represent even greater and more profound concepts.The version which follows is formatted for a general invocation of each elementin its appropriate quarter. A comparable banishing ceremony is accomplished byfollowing the same procedure but utilizing Banishing Pentagrams. Even though agreat deal of elemental energy is generated by this ritual, it is done safelybecause the active and passive nature of the elements and their position in thecircle tend to balance each other off quite nicely. (Active Air in the East isbalanced by passive Water in the West, active Fire in the South is balanced bypassive Earth in the North.) THE GREATER RITUALOF THEPENTAGRAM 1. Touching the forehead, say Ateh (Unto Thee).2. Touching the breast, say Malkuth (The Kingdom).3. Touching the right shoulder, say ve-Geburah (and the Power).4.

Repeat 1-5.images [../images/00013.jpeg]Ceremonies to invoke or banish a specific element can be constructed by openingand closing as above, but instead of going through the entire sequence ofactions, the magician simply turns to the appropriate quarter and proceeds withthe Pentagrams, Signs, and Names applicable to the desired element.As the magician's understanding of the theories and processes evolves, he or shewill design more complex and elaborate variations of the Greater PentagramRitual to access the elemental energies for more specific magical purposes, suchas the consecration of the magical weapons or the charging of talismans."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVEimages [../images/00006.jpeg]THE THELEMIC RITUALS OF THE PENTAGRAMStooping down, dipping my wings, I came unto the darkly-splendid abodes.There in that formless abyss was I made a partaker of the Mysteries Averse.—LIBER LXVAs stated earlier, mastery of the Lesser and Greater Rituals of the Pentagramprovides the Magician with the key to the microcosmic, elemental universe.Logically one would think the next task would be to gain mastery of themacrocosmic universe represented in nature by the seven planets of the ancients.In Western Hermeticism this “Greater World” is symbolically depicted as ahexagram with the Sun in the center and the six remaining planets—Saturn,Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Mercury, and Luna—positioned at each point. Mastery of theHexagram rituals has traditionally been the next step in the magician's career.1[part0023.html#chap5-fn1]The influence of the elemental formula does not end at the borders of themicrocosm. Indeed, it continues to be infused into all levels of consciousness.The most striking example of this elemental influence upon the macrocosm can befound in the Enochian magical records of Dr. John Dee.In the Enochian view of the universe, each of the thirty Aethyrs, or macrocosmicheavens2 [part0023.html#chap5-fn2], is ruled by three Governors.3[part0023.html#chap5-fn3] Curiously, the names of these celestial Governors arederived from the four microcosmic elemental tablets of the system, demonstratinga continuing and fundamental influence of the elemental formulae throughout themacrocosm.Clearly there exists an untapped form of universal Pentagram which operatessimultaneously upon both the microcosmic and macrocosmic planes, and that thenewly released energies of the new aeon make magical access to these formulaenow possible. To activate this vastly higher order of elemental power, Crowleycreated two rituals: (1) Liber XXV, The Star Ruby, and (2) Liber V vel Reguli.As Thelemic hybrids of the Lesser and Greater Pentagram Rituals, they functionas ceremonial exercises to invoke the energies of the Aeon of Horus.In these two ceremonies the focus of the magician's consciousness is shiftedfrom the Earth to the Sun; from the human to the Divine. No longer do we viewourselves as standing upon the surface of the Earth (with its four quartersruled by the terrestrial winds), or even at the intersection of Samekh and Pé.We now identify ourselves with the Sun, surrounded by the zodiacal belt.In both rituals the divine names attributed to the four quarters have becomeovertly Thelemic. The Star Ruby retains the same active/passive positionsestablished in the Greater Ritual of the Pentagram; the active/male deities(Therion and Hadit) are positioned in the active quarters (East and South, andthe passive/female deities (Babalon and Nuit) are positioned in the passivequarters (West and North).In Liber V vel Reguli the zodiacal landmarks of the four quarters are the fixedor Kerubic signs: Taurus/Earth in the East; Aquarius/Air in the North;Scorpio/Water in the West; and Leo/Fire in the South.4 [part0023.html#chap5-fn4]Of the triplicity of signs, the Fixed signs are the most characteristicallyrepresentative of the elements.5 [part0023.html#chap5-fn5]Thelemic Holy Words and Divine NamesBefore we proceed to the rituals themselves, let us take just a few moments andexamine the various Holy Words and Divine Names unique to the Magick of Thelema.To fathom transcendental concepts, one must possess transcendental illumination.Consequently the Holy Words and Divine Names of the Thelemic pantheon defyadequate literary definition. As the magician's initiatory career evolves, sotoo will his or her capacity to understand and exploit the divine principlesrepresented by the words. I do not presume to offer, nor am I capable ofestablishing, orthodox definitions of these terms. I have even been counseled(by those whose opinions I highly respect) that anything I say on the matterwill be pitifully inadequate, and will ultimately serve only to limit thereader's understanding. While I wholeheartedly agree this is true, I am alsoconvinced that the reader, if warned that the notes that follow are the flawed,incomplete, and inaccurate thoughts of one who has not yet achieved anysignificant level of illumination, he or she may nevertheless appreciate astarting point for further study and meditation.NUITSee Liber AL vel Legis (especially Chapter I).The First Deity of the Thelemic Trinity; traditionally the Egyptian Goddess ofthe night sky. She is the “…star-goddess, who is the category of unlimitedpossibility.”6 [part0023.html#chap5-fn6] Upon the Stélé of Revealing, and inEgyptian art, She is depicted as an azure goddess, tall and slender, archingover the earth. (Similar in appearance to the Greek letter Ω.) She isconceptualized as the infinity of an ultimately expanded universe (thecircumference of the circle). All things, therefore, are contained within herbody. Qabalists may wish to consider the similarities to the Second Veil of theNegative proceeding Kether, AIN SOPH (No Limit).HADITSee Liber AL vel Legis (especially Chapter II).The Second Deity of the Thelemic Trinity. Lover of Nuit. He is depicted on theStélé of Revealing as a winged globe at the heart of Nuit. He is conceptualizedas the infinity of an ultimately contracted universe; the point in the center ofthe circle. He is “…the ubiquitous point of view, the only philosophicallytenable conception of Reality.”7 [part0023.html#chap5-fn7] (Perhaps the conceptof the pre “Big-Bang” negative singularity postulated by modern physics.)Qabalists may wish to consider the similarities to the First Veil of theNegative proceeding Kether, AIN (Nothing).RA HOOR KHUITSee Liber AL vel Legis (especially Chapter III).The Third Deity of the Thelemic Trinity. The Crowned and Conquering Child of theunion of Nuit and Hadit. As Nuit's expansion and Hadit's contraction are bothinfinite, so too must be their points of contact. This infinite contact createsthe basis of possible vibration, (their Child Horus); the field of operation inwhich the universe can manifest. “He is, however, known under his special name,Heru-ra-ha. A double god; his extraverted form is Ra-hoor-khuit; and his passiveor introverted form Hoor-pa-kraat.”8 [part0023.html#chap5-fn8] Spellingvariations found in Liber AL vel Legis include Ra Hoor Khut and Ra Hoor Khu, andare indicative of important facets of the Deity.Qabalists may wish to consider the similarities to the Third Veil of theNegative proceeding Kether, AIN SOPH AUR (Limitless Light); also Kether itself.In one respect He is the fundamental archetype of the God-Man, and the HolyGuardian Angel.THERION AND BABALONSee Liber AL vel Legis (especially references to the Beast & Scarlet Woman).It is clear that from an early age Crowley was spiritually and psychologicallytraumatized as the result of his family's fanatical embrace of Christianfundamentalism. It was perhaps inevitable that an individual of Crowley's geniuswould eventually rebel against the stifling restrictions, and the threats ofeternal torment with which such cults terrorize their members. His childhoodidentification with the Beast 666 and his “Devil be my God” bravado was hisyouthful declaration of independence, and for the rest of his life he wouldcontinue to enjoy shocking the shockable with such sacrileges. We must pointout, however, that there are profound magical and qabalistic significances tothese “blasphemies” that Crowley so cavalierly embraced in his youth, and theseimmeasurably overshadow his mischievous preoccupation with thumbing his nose atChristianity.The use of the names Therion (Greek for Beast) and Babalon (the Scarlet Woman orGreat Whore) is not unique in the annals of religious nomenclature. Togetherthey make their first and most notoriously misunderstood appearance in The Bookof the Revelation of John, the finale of the New Testament. A superficial reviewof this book presents us with what appears at first glance to be two shady, ifnot downright “evil,” characters. But looks can be deceiving, and as is oftenthe case with books of the Bible, the villain of the exoteric story isfrequently revealed to be the hero of the esoteric interpretation.There is no need to enter into the argument as to whether “Beast” refers to theman Aleister Crowley, or to the “office” of the Beast, or to some universalprincipal. At one time or another before his death, Crowley wrote that they wereall of the above.9 [part0023.html#chap5-fn9] For our purposes we will simplyattempt to introduce the concepts by drawing parallels to ideas with which thereader may already be acquainted:Therion/Babalon as Chokmah/Binah—To the student of the Qabalah the easiest wayto begin to understand Therion and Babalon is to conceptualize them aspersonifications of the second and third Sephiroth of the Tree of Life, Chokmahand Binah, respectively.The second Sephirah, Chokmah represents the original concept of duality, and assuch is the chaotic despoiler of the perfect unity of the first Sephirah,Kether. Chaos is another title of Chokmah and in certain Thelemic ritual isidentified with Therion. Chokmah is also the Divine Will, the Logos, the Wordwhose vibration is the creative essence of universe. As the supernal Father,Chokmah/Therion is the archetype of the lingam, the universal Male. As TO MEGATHERION10 [part0023.html#chap5-fn10] (his motto as Magus 9°= 2▫), Crowley isconsidered by Thelemites to be the Logos of the Aeon of Horus.The third Sephirah, Binah represents the original reconciliation and balance ofthe Divine Self (Kether) and the reflected Not Self (Chokmah). She is viewed asthe all-receptive mate of Chokmah and when they are united the primal unity ofKether is realized. As Binah/Babalon resides just above the Abyss, Sheeventually receives unto Herself the totality of the life of the evolvinguniverse. This universal life is symbolized as the “blood of the Saints” whichShe gathers up into Her great cup (the Holy Graal). This She shares with theBeast, and they unite in drunken ecstasy. Thus she is called the Great Whore forin her “shamelessness” she receives all and refuses none.Therion/Babalon as Shiva/Shakti—To the student of the Yoga or Tantric Buddhism,the easiest way to think about Therion and Babalon is to conceptualize them asthe two polar streams of creation, Shiva—the Divine Will, the Logos, whomanifests in creative union with His divine consort, Shakti—the Divine Power andthe underlying and secret force permeating all of creation.Babalon/Shakti is the passive, negative stream of nature. She is magnetic andattracts to Herself, the potentiality of energy. This she absorbs and stores up(the Holy Graal, the Cup of Babalon). When the negative/feminine Shakti comesinto proper contact with the positive/masculine Shiva, a dynamic reaction occurstriggering the transcendence of their individual polarity, transforming theminto Brahma, the changeless One. This is a most important aspect of Therion andBabalon because it relates to natural energies and forces residing in our ownbodies.Slumbering in the form of a coiled serpent at the base of the human spine is theKundalini, a remnant of the universal Shakti. She has been separated and exiledfrom Her Lord Shiva (who resides in the human skull) by the very process ofcreation. The task of the Kundalini Yogi is to awaken this sleeping Goddess anddirect her ascent up the spine to eventual union with Her Lord in the cranium.But one does not have to be a Yogi or a Qabalist or a Ceremonial Magician toachieve transcendental states of consciousness in the ecstasy of lovemaking orto temporarily annihilate the ego in orgasm. These are fundamental male/femalerealities of existence and consciousness, and they are an integral part ofcosmos from the lowest hell to the highest heaven. More on this in Chapter Six[part0015.html].AIWASSSee Liber AL vel Legis, Chapter I.Alternate spelling AIWAZ. The “minister of Hoor-paar-kraat.”11[part0023.html#chap5-fn11] Praeter human intelligence who dictated the threechapters of Liber AL vel Legis. Aiwass is considered messenger of the Gods ofthe Aeon of Horus. Crowley would eventually identify Aiwass as his own HolyGuardian Angel. I was told by both Israel Regardie and Grady McMurtry thatCrowley acknowledged Aiwass in the Qabalistic Cross portion of the Pentagramrituals as follows: 1. Touching the forehead, say Ateh (Unto Thee), 2. Touching the heart, say Aiwass, 3. Touching the genitals, say Malkuth (The Kingdom), 4. Touching the right shoulder, say ve-Geburah (and the Power), 5. Touching the left shoulder, say ve-Gedulah (and the Glory). 6. Clasping the hand upon the breast, say le-OLAHM, AMEN, (To the Ages, Amen).PANGreek for “All.” Originally the lusty and mischievous rustic God of Thracianshepherds; His audacious and colorful personality captured the imagination ofthe entire Hellenistic world, and established for Pan a permanent place in Greekmythology. Pan is, however, more than a playful imp. Even in the ancient mythsone can see an underlying profundity to his escapades that hint that Pan may bea deity of a far greater order than His Olympian contemporaries. His namesuggests that He is the Great All; the God who transcends the gods. The “Comedyof Pan” is the singular reality of life itself. For those of us who have not yetachieved the levels of illumination necessary to perceive this greater reality,life is a dizzying mixture of pleasure and pain, joy and sorrow. Finding one'sTrue Will is the key to embracing, then transcending these dualities andbecoming an ecstatic and enthusiastic player in the great Comedy of Pan.12[part0023.html#chap5-fn12] IO PAN is the traditional invocation of Pan. I (thelingam) joined with O (the yoni) is a simple yet explicit invitation for the Godwho transcends duality to couple with the devotee.ANKH-AF-NA-KHONSUSee Liber AL vel Legis, Chapters I & III.Egyptian priest of the XXVth Dynasty.13 [part0023.html#chap5-fn13] The Stélé ofRevealing is the funerary tablet of Ankh-af-na-Khonsu who reportedly painted ithimself upon stuccoed wood. He is depicted on the stélé standing at the table ofofferings before the God, Ra-Hoor-Khuit. Crowley claimed that asAnkh-af-na-Khonsu, in a previous incarnation, he was responsible for initiatingthe Aeon of Osiris.LAShTALSee essay following Liber V vel Reguli (page 100 [part0014.html#page_100]).AGAPELove; in Greek enumerates to 93.AUMGNThelemic expansion of OM (AUM) the creative vibration that sustains theuniverse.

Spelled images [../images/00027.jpeg] in Hebrew andFIAOF in Greek (both 93). By adding a F as prefix and suffix of IAO, Crowleyconsidered it to be “…a proper hieroglyph of the Ritual of Self-Initiation inthis Aeon of Horus.”15 [part0023.html#chap5-fn15]ABRAHADABRAThe great Magick Word of the Aeon of Horus. Volumes of commentaries could bewritten on this word alone, and so I will not project even the pretense ofthoroughness in my comments. References to ABRAHADABRA are found throughoutCrowley's works but the reader is especially encouraged to study “An Essay UponNumber” found in 777.16 [part0023.html#chap5-fn16]Briefly, its eleven letters (five identical and six diverse) are illustrative ofthe Great Work accomplished. It joins that which is above to that which isbelow—the microcosmic world of 5 to the macrocosmic world of 6.It enumerates to 418 the same as the Hebrew letter Cheth spelled in full. ThePath of Cheth crosses the Abyss, joining the fifth Sephirah, Geburah, with thethird Sephirah, Binah (the abode of Babalon). The tarot card attributed to Chethis the Charioteer who bears the Holy Graal across the Abyss where it becomes theCup of Babalon.There are other names and words unique to Thelemic Magick which we will discussin later chapters. As I explained earlier, these are not orthodox (or evenadequate) definitions.Thelemic Pentagram Ritual ITHE STAR RUBYThere are at least four published versions of The Star Ruby. Most of them varyonly slightly from one another. For our purposes we will use the version whichappears in BOOK IV, Part Three: Magick in Theory and Practice.17[part0023.html#chap5-fn17] We have numbered each line for reference purposes.It must be noted that the oldest version, which appeared in the 1913 firstedition of The Book of Lies,18 [part0023.html#chap5-fn18] employs Greek DivineNames and other variations that differ considerably from later versions. Crowleyrevised the ritual in the 1920s to conform with Liber V vel Reguli, and toexpress his expanded understanding of Thelemic cosmology. We have included theinformation from this first version in the endnotes of the text and stronglyrecommend that it be carefully studied.The Star Ruby differs from the traditional Pentagram rituals in many other waysbesides the Divine Names (i.e., parts of the ceremony are in Greek, thePentagrams are imagined, not drawn, the magician moves widdershins around thecircle, etc.). Perhaps the most significant innovation is the introduction ofthe invocation of Pan by the application of the N.O.X. formula. This, more thanany other part of the ritual, elevates The Star Ruby above a simple banishingritual by integrating the formula of the Supernal Triad.19[part0023.html#chap5-fn19] The reader is encouraged to carefully study the noteswhich follow the text of the ritual for greater insight on this most importantaspect of Thelemic Magick.Referring to the Greek words employed in The Star Ruby, Crowley wrote, “Thesecret sense of these words is to be sought in the numeration thereof.” To helpthe student with further research, we have included a table outlining thenumerical equivalents of the Greek Alphabet (see Table 1 [part0014.html#tab1],page 81 [part0014.html#page_81]).Table 1.

Unthreateningly described as “an incantationproper to invoke the Energies of the Aeon of Horus, adapted for the daily use ofthe Magician of whatever grade,” its ambiguities and mysteries neverthelesscontinue to challenge and intrigue students.Crowley's published comments on Reguli are sparse, so I have been fortunate tohave been allowed access to Crowley's notes and several unpublished versions ofthe ritual which have been helpful in writing this chapter.Crowley introduces Reguli as “the Ritual of the Mark of the Beast,” which to agreat many people, especially those who think they understand the Book of theRevelation of John, has a decidedly sinister ring to it. But, as is usually thecase with the nomenclature of Thelemic Magick, the expression that evokes fearand loathing in the hearts of the profane, is revealed to the wise to be aprofound and spiritually wholesome arcanum.To the Qabalist, the Mark of the Beast (Rev. 13:16) is the New Testamentdevelopment of the Mark of Cain (Gen. 4:15), which, contrary to popularreligious interpretation, is not the brand of a cursed sinner, but insteadrepresents the radiant seal of illumination in the forehead of the Initiate.Graphically, the Mark of the Beast is represented in its most simple form as theSun and Moon27 [part0023.html#chap5-fn27] united (images [../images/00031.jpeg])and, among other things, is the symbol of Babalon and the Beast conjoined, andthe Great Work accomplished.Therefore, as…an incantation proper to invoke the Energies of the Aeon of Horus…the Ritual of the Mark of the Beast, if properly executed, serves to rewire thepsychic body of the magician to accommodate these higher spiritual energies. Infact, the overt employment of the various chakras makes Reguli as much a yogicexercise as a ritual of ceremonial Magick.While roughly adhering to the basic format of the Pentagram rituals and The StarRuby, there are some fundamental and drastic differences that distinguish LiberV vel Reguli. Some of these are obvious. Others I feel need to be addressed.The First GestureThe Qabalistic Cross opening found in the previous rituals affirms the threecolumns of the Tree of Life: the Middle Pillar (Ateh-Malkuth), the Pillar ofSeverity (Geburah), and the Pillar of Mercy (Gedulah). In Reguli this as beenreplaced by the “Vertical Component of the Enchantment,” which affirms theMiddle Pillar; and the three “Horizontal Components of the Enchantment,” whichaffirms the three horizontal Paths which join the Pillar of Severity to thePillar of Mercy. “Thus shall he formulate the Sigil of the Grand Hierophant.”Incorporation of the horizontal Paths is perhaps the most notable innovation ofReguli and sets it apart, fundamentally, from all other rituals of thePentagram. This is especially significant in light of the fact that Crowleymaintained that the Aeon of Horus activated the Path of Teth28[part0023.html#chap5-fn28] (the horizontal Path between fifth Sephirah, Geburah,and the fourth Sephirah, Chesed) on the Universal Tree of Life. (See figure 4[part0014.html#fig4], page 88 [part0014.html#page_88].)images [../images/00032.jpeg]Figure 4. The vertical and horizontal components of the enchantment correspondto the Thelemic pantheon and relate directly to the Tree of Life and the SevenChakras. a) Sigil of the Grand Hierophant projected on the Tree of Life; b) TheSigil of the Grand Hierophant created by the Vertical and Horizontal Componentsof the Enchantment projected upon the Seven Chakras.The Second GestureLike the Lesser and the Greater Rituals of the Pentagram, the Pentagrams inReguli are drawn in the air. But unlike any of the previous ceremonies, thePentagrams employed in Reguli are described as “averse.”Crowley was a master of the English language and averse is a very curious wordfor him to use. What is an averse Pentagram? Is it upside down? If so, invertedwould be a much more accurate word. Is it upright with the elemental positionsreversed? Unfortunately Crowley published no precise definition.In 1978, I asked Israel Regardie what he thought Crowley meant. To mydisappointment he told me that he didn't know for certain, but believed Crowleymay have simply wished to shock and outrage the members of the Golden Dawn whosefear of the inverted Pentagram bordered on phobia.29 [part0023.html#chap5-fn29]Regardie recommended that I use the traditional upright invoking Pentagrams.Other Crowley experts have been even less helpful on the subject, suggestingeverything from reversed upright Pentagrams to upside-down Pentagrams formulatedin the mind and hurled forth as in The Star Ruby.images [../images/00033.jpeg]Figure 5. Averse Pentagrams.The dictionary defines averse as “turned away or backward.” In botany it refersto leaves which are turned away from the axis or main stem as opposed to adversein which the leaves turn toward the axis. By this definition we might concludethat two Pentagrams, one upright and one inverted, joined horizontally at theaxis of their bases, could both be considered averse to each other; we couldalso conclude (though with less conviction) that two upright Pentagramsmirroring each other right to left are also averse (see figure 5[part0014.html#fig5], above).Following the qabalistic axiom of polarities (we are negative to the plane aboveus, and positive to the plane below us), we might wish to follow this line ofreasoning a bit further. The two Pentagrams with the horizontal axis could beprojected upon the Tree of Life as shown in figure 6 [part0014.html#fig6].images [../images/00034.jpeg]Figure 6. Two Pentagrams with the horizontal axis upon the Tree of Life.Granted this arrangement leaves poor Malkuth dangling, (a position not withoutqabalistic precedence) but everything else fits quite nicely. Using the Path ofTeth as the base line, all three horizontal paths so important to Liber V velReguli are represented. Also note the two tetrahedrons formed by thisarrangement.images [../images/00035.jpeg]Figure 7. Four averse Pentagrams upon the Tree of Life.Another method is to project all four averse Pentagrams upon the tree as shownin figure 7 [part0014.html#fig7], above. Here we see that the Path of Teth, isunique among the three horizontal paths. Like a looking glass, it is the pointof reflection; the pivotal axis to all four averse Pentagrams.Once the four are superimposed upon the Tree, we discover that they form adouble version of Crowley's Unicursal Hexagram, the Hexagram of the Beast, whichis traced in line 20 of the Second Gesture of Reguli (see figure 8[part0014.html#fig8]).images [../images/00036.jpeg]Figure 8. Four averse Pentagrams forming Unicursal Hexagrams.The student wishing to pursue this line of speculation further can constructPentagrams based on the Universe card, the five of disks from Crowley's Thoth30[part0023.html#chap5-fn30] Tarot deck, the elemental format of those used in theGreater Ritual of the Pentagram, or by projecting the Pentagrams upon the Treeof Life, according to the elemental rulership of the Sephiroth. Viewed inrelation to other Thelemic rituals, especially The Star Sapphire, there are evensubtler and more complex considerations to be weighed, including the concept ofemploying the N.O.X. formula to access an averse (or reversed) Tree of Life.Speculation on this matter could continue indefinitely, and I am not at all surethat wasn't Crowley's intention. Over the last twenty years, as my understandingand appreciation of Thelemic rituals has grown, my opinion on this subject haschanged at least a dozen times. Confusion over this point, however, did notprevent me from learning the ritual and working with it on a daily basis. It isonly by working the rituals, that any significant degree of understanding candevelop. If you wait until you are positive you understand all aspects of theceremony before beginning to work, you will never begin to work.All conjecture aside, the whole question of the averse Pentagrams seems tofinally have been put to rest by a manuscript bearing Crowley's handwrittennotes and drawings, recently found at the George Arents Research Library atSyracuse University This typescript, whose provenance has been tentativelyattributed to 1928, includes the entire text of Liber V vel Regu!i, completewith drawings of the various Pentagrams and symbols. It reveals withoutambiguity that the averse Pentagram is simply the standard Pentagram turnedupside down (see figure 9 [part0014.html#fig9] below).images [../images/00037.jpeg]Figure 9. Averse Pentagram.The elements remain in their same positions, and directions for invoking andbanishing are exactly as they would be if you drew a standard, upright Pentagramon a piece of paper, and then simply turned the paper upside down.Now we know for certain what the averse Pentagrams are, but why do we use them?A clue to our answer might be found in Reguli's unique positioning of the fourfixed signs of the zodiac.Traditionally the zodiac is thought of as a belt on twelve constellations, orsigns through which the sun passes (from the earth's point of view) in acounterclockwise yearly journey. We could make a traditional magical circle ofthe zodiacal belt, by placing Taurus in the East, Leo in the North, Scorpio inthe West and Aquarius in the South (see figure 10 [part0014.html#fig10], below).images [../images/00038.jpeg]Figure 10. Traditional view of the zodiac as a magical circle. There are fixedsigns in the quarters. The magician is facing Taurus (East).As we will see in Reguli, however, this is not the case; Taurus is still in theEast, and Scorpio is still in the West, but the positions of Leo and Aquariusare reversed. In other words, for this ritual, the signs of the zodiac are nowrunning clockwise. Has Crowley turned the belt of the zodiac upside down? No. Hehas turned the magician upside down.As I have mentioned earlier, in the Thelemic rituals of the Pentagram themagician no longer thinks of himself or herself as standing upon the surface ofthe Earth (geocentric), but rather, identifies with the Sun (heliocentric). Fromthe Sun's point of view there is no up or down. In order to help liberate themagician from the old aeon illusion of restricted orientation, Crowley nowpositions us upside down in the center of the zodiacal belt. In this positionthe zodiac now appears to run clockwise and, from the point of view ofmicrocosmic orientation, the Pentagrams we would draw from this position arenaturally averse. If it were possible for you to actually perform Liber V velReguli while standing on your head, then (from your upside-down point of view)the zodiac would run counterclockwise, and the Pentagrams would be upright.Perhaps, for some, the averse Pentagram will continue to be the frightful symbolof the triumph of matter over Spirit (as the aspirants of the Golden Dawn arewarned). In Reguli, however, it is not a case of matter triumphing over Spirit,rather, it is a case of Spirit descending into matter.31[part0023.html#chap5-fn31]I have incorporated Crowley's notes and drawings from the above-mentionedmanuscript in the text of Reguli that follows. I have also included, asfootnotes, his comments from another manuscript. My own comments as editor areidentified as such.

Let him make the sign called Puella, standing with feet together, head bowed,his left hand shielding his phallus, and his right hand shielding his breast(attitude of the Venus de Medici).8.

Let him point his Wand to the Centre of the Pentagram, and cry THERION!14. Let him give the sign called Vir, the feet being together. The hands, withclenched fingers and thumbs thrust out forwards, are held to the temples; thehead is then bowed and pushed out, as if to symbolize the butting of an hornedbeast (attitude of Pan, Bacchus, etc.) (Frontispiece, Eqx. I - III).15. Proceeding as before, let him make in the West the Averse Pentagram wherebyWater is invoked images [../images/00043.jpeg].41 [part0023.html#chap5-fn41]16.

And in the Column stands His six-rayed Splendour![This dance may be omitted, and the whole Utterance chanted in the attitude ofPtah.]THE FINAL GESTUREThis is identical with the First Gesture.[Here followeth an impression of the ideas implied in the Paean.]44[part0023.html#chap5-fn44]I also am a Star in Space, unique and self-existent, an individual essenceincorruptible; I also am one Soul; I am identical with All and None. I am inAll, and all in me; I am, apart from all and lord of all, and one with all.I am a God, I very God of very God; I go upon my way to work my Will; I havemade Matter and Motion for my mirror; I have decreed for my delight thatNothingness should figure itself as twain, that I might dream a dance of namesand natures, and enjoy the substance of simplicity by watching the wanderings ofmy shadows. I am not that which is not; I know not that which knows not; I lovenot that which loves not. For I am Love, whereby division dies in delight; I amKnowledge, whereby all parts, plunged in the whole, perish and pass intoperfection; and I am that I am, the being wherein Being is lost in Nothing, nordeigns to be but by its Will to unfold its nature, its need to express itsperfection in all possibilities, each phase a partial phantasm, and yetinevitable and absolute.I am Omniscient, for naught exists for me unless I know it. I am Omnipotent, fornaught occurs save by Necessity, my Soul's expression through my Will to be, todo, to suffer the symbols of itself. I am Omnipresent, for naught exists where Iam not, who fashioned Space as a condition of my consciousness of myself, who amthe centre of all, and my circumference the frame of mine own fancy.I am the All, for all that exists for me is a necessary expression in thought ofsome tendency of my nature, and all my thoughts are only the letters of my Name.I am the One, for all that I am is not the absolute All, and all my all is mineand not another's; mine, who conceive of others like myself in essence andtruth, yet unlike in expression and illusion.I am the None, for all that I am is the imperfect image of the perfect; eachpartial phantom must perish in the clasp of its counterpart; each form fulfilitself by finding its equated opposite, and satisfying its need to be theAbsolute by the attainment of annihilation.The Word, LAShTAL includes all this.LA—Naught.AL—Two.L is “Justice”, the Kteis fulfilled by the Phallus, “Naught and Two” because thePlus and the Minus have united in “love under will.”A is “the Fool”, Naught in Thought (Parzival), Word (Harpocrates), and Action(Bacchus). He is the boundless air, the wandering Ghost, but with“possibilities.” He is the Naught that the Two have made by “love under will.”LA thus represents the Ecstasy of Nuit and Hadit conjoined, lost in love, andmaking themselves Naught thereby. Their child is begotten and conceived, but isin the phase of Naught also, as yet. LA is thus the Universe in that phase, withits potentialities of manifestation.AL, on the contrary, though it is essentially identical with LA, shows the Foolmanifested through the Equilibrium of Contraries. The weight is still nothing,but it is expressed as if it were two equal weights in opposite scales. Theindicator still points to zero.ShT is equally 31 with LA and AL, but it expresses the secret nature whichoperates the Magick or the transmutations.ShT is the formula of this particular aeon; another aeon might have another wayof saying 31.Sh is Fire as T is Force; conjoined they express Ra-Hoor-Khuit.“The Angel”45 [part0023.html#chap5-fn45] represents the Stélé 666, showing theGods of the Aeon, while “Strength”46 [part0023.html#chap5-fn46] is a picture ofBabalon and The Beast, the earthly emissaries of those Gods.ShT is the dynamic equivalent of LA and AL. Sh shows the Word of the Law, beingtriple, as 93 is thrice 31. T shows the formula of Magick declared in that Word;the Lion, the Serpent, the Sun, Courage and Sexual Love are all indicated by thecard.In LA note that Saturn or Satan is exalted in the House of Venus or Astarte, andit is an airy sign. Thus L is Father-Mother, Two and Naught, and the Spirit(Holy Ghost) of their Love is also Naught. Love is AHBH, 13, which is AChD,Unity, 1, Aleph, who is The Fool who is Naught, but none the less an IndividualOne, who (as such) is not another, yet unconscious of himself until his Onenessexpresses itself as a duality.Any impression or idea is unknowable in itself. It can mean nothing untilbrought into relation with other things. The first step is to distinguish onethought from another; this is the condition of recognizing it. To define it, wemust perceive its orientation to all our other ideas. The extent of ourknowledge of any one thing varies therefore with the number of ideas with whichwe can compare it. Every new fact not only adds itself to our universe, butincreases the value of what we already possess.In AL this “The” or “God” arranges for “Countenance to behold countenance, byestablishing itself as an equilibrium, A the One-Naught conceived as L theTwo-Naught. This L is the Son-Daughter Horus-Harpocrates just as the other L wasthe Father-Mother Set-Isis. Here then is Tetragrammaton once more, but expressedin identical equations in which every term is perfect in itself as a mode ofNaught.ShT supplies the last element; making the Word of either five or six letters,according as we regard ShT as one letter or two. Thus the Word affirms the GreatWork accomplished: 5° = 6▫.ShT is moreover a necessary resolution of the apparent opposition of LA and AL;for one could hardly pass to the other without the catalytic action of a thirdidentical expression whose function should be to transmute them. Such a termmust be in itself a mode of Naught, and its nature cannot encroach on theperfections of Not-Being, LA, or of Being, AL. It must be purely Nothing-Matter,so as to create a Matter-in-Motion which is a function of “Something.”Thus ShT is Motion in its double phase, an inertia composed of two oppositecurrents, and each current is also thus polarized. Sh is Heaven and Earth, TMale and Female; ShT is Spirit and Matter; one is the Word of Liberty and Loveflashing its Light to restore Life to Earth; the other is the act by which Lifeclaims that Love is Light and Liberty. And these are Two-in-One, the divineletter of Silence-in-Speech whose symbol is the Sun in the arms of the Moon.But Sh and T are alike formulae of force in action as opposed to entities; theyare not states of existence, but modes of motion. They are verbs, not nouns.Sh is the Holy Spirit as a “tongue of fire” manifest in triplicity, and is thechild of Set-Isis as their Logos or Word uttered by their “Angel.” The card isXX, and 20 is the value of Yod (the secret seed of all things, the Virgin, theHermit, Mercury, the Angel or Herald) expressed in full as IVD. Sh is theSpiritual congress of Heaven and Earth.But T is the Holy Spirit in action as a “roaring lion” or as the “old Serpent”instead of as an “Angel of Light.” The twins of Set-Isis, harlot and beast, arebusy with that sodomitic and incestuous lust which is the traditional formulafor producing demi-gods, as in the cases of Mary and the Dove; Leda and theSwan, etc. The card is XI, the number of Magick AVD: Aleph the Fool impregnatingthe woman according to the word of Yod, the Angel of the Lord! His sister hadseduced her brother Beast, shaming the Sun with her sin; she has mastered theLion and enchanted the Serpent. Nature is outraged by Magick; man is bestializedand woman defiled. The conjunction produces a monster; it affirms regression oftypes. Instead of a man-God conceived of the Spirit of God by a virgin ininnocence, we are asked to adore the bastard of a whore and a brute, begotten inshamefullest sin and born in most blasphemous bliss."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXimages [../images/00006.jpeg]THE HEXAGRAM RITUALS0.

And these twelve rays are one.—LIBER DCCCXII VEL ARARITAOnce the magician has become adept in the execution of the microcosmic ritualsof the Pentagram, the next step, according to tradition, is to master therituals of the Signet Star of the macrocosm, the Hexagram. The Thelemic ritualof the Hexagram is Liber XXXVI, The Star Sapphire which first appeared in the1913 first edition of The Book of Lies. As we will see later, this ritual ismuch more than the conventional Ritual of the Hexagram, super-charged withThelemic components. In fact there are many who consider it Crowley's greatestcontribution to Western Hermeticism.But before examining The Star Sapphire we need a fundamental understanding ofclassic rituals of the Hexagram. To this end we will first examine the LesserRitual of the Hexagram and Crowley's comments on the Greater Ritual of theHexagram as they appear in Liber O, Part IV.1 [part0023.html#chap6-fn1] For themost part, the rituals are self-explanatory, so I have kept my introductorycomments brief.The Golden Dawn defined the Hexagram as “…a powerful symbol representing theoperation of the Seven Planets under the presidency of the Sephiroth, and of theseven-lettered Name ARARITA…a divine name…formed of the Hebrew initials of thesentences: One is his beginning. One is his individuality. His permutation isone.”2 [part0023.html#chap6-fn2]Perhaps the most concise definition of ARARITA can be found in the Englishtranslation of the last words of The Star Sapphire: “Six in One through thenames of Seven in One, Ararita.”3 [part0023.html#chap6-fn3] Concerning thissevenfold word Crowley wrote in his 1909 privately printed edition of θελημα;The use of this Name and Formula is to equate and identify every idea with itsopposite; thus being released from the obsession of thinking any one of them as<<true>> (and therefore binding); one can withdraw oneself from the whole sphereof the Ruach.4 [part0023.html#chap6-fn4]The Hexagram itself is illustrative of the union of opposites. In its classicform it combines the red upright triangle of Fire with the blue triangle ofWater which has its apex pointing downward. (We will learn in the next chapter[part0016.html] this is not the case in The Star Sapphire.)As we see in figure 11 [part0015.html#fig11] below, when projected upon the Treeof Life, the Hexagram includes Sephiroth three5 [part0023.html#chap6-fn5]through nine. Daath-Binah notwithstanding, this area of the Tree of Life isattributed to the third qabalistic world, Yetzirah, and the Vav of theTetragrammaton. If we recall the allegory of the Tetragrammaton,Princess/Heh-final, (anesthetized and exiled in the microcosmic world of 5),must be awakened by the kiss of Prince/Vav (her brother-lover-emissary of themacrocosmic world of 6). Their union eventually results in the Princess becomingthe Supernal Queen/Heh and the Prince becoming King/Yod. The spiritual rolesthese four characters play will become profoundly important to the understandingof The Star Sapphire.Vav = 6 and, in this place, representitive of the Holy Guardian Angel. The firstphase of the Great Work is to unite the 5 of the Magician with the 6 of theH.G.A.; and the first step in doing that is to “…equate and identify every ideawith its opposite….”6 [part0023.html#chap6-fn6] Regular performance of theLesser Ritual of the Pentagram followed by the Lesser Ritual of the Hexagram isthe symbolic enactment of this process, and continues to be an excellentceremonial routine even for the most advanced magician.images [../images/00045.jpeg]Figure 11. The Hexagram projected upon the Tree of Life.In the Rituals of the Hexagram, the magician stands as the Sun surrounded by thebelt of the zodiac. The zodiacal landmarks of the quarters are the CardinalSigns which are oriented on the solar axes of the equinoxes and solstices: Aries-Fire in the East; Capricorn-Earth in the South; Libra-Air in the West; andCancer-Water in the North. Standing at the intersection, and representing avertical line running perpendicular to the two lines of the cross, the magiciansets to work from a position of supreme balance.The rituals begin with the analysis of the Key Word INRI7[part0023.html#chap6-fn7] from the 5° = 6▫ ceremony of the Golden Dawn.Considered by the Adepts of the Aeon of Osiris to be the “new, improved” magicalformula of the day, the latinized/ Christian formula of resurrection (INRI) isseen to conceal the great formulae of the Egyptians and the Gnostics (IAO). Asthe Qabalistic Cross section of the Pentagram Ritual affirms the magician'sidentity as a perfect reflection of the Tree of Life, this section of theHexagram Ritual is the magician's assertion that he or she is an integral partof the evolving magical formula of the universe.Only the traditional versions of the Hexagram (see figure 12[part0015.html#fig12], below) were used to illustrate Liber O. For zodiacal andplanetary work, as outlined in Crowley's comments on the Greater HexagramRitual, one could just as easily employ Unicursal Hexagrams (see figure 12[part0015.html#fig12], below). This is a particularly Thelemic form of theHexagram and will play a large part in our study of the Holy Hexagram of theStar Sapphire. Table 2 [part0015.html#tab2] (on page 107[part0015.html#page_107]) shows the various Unicursal Hexagrams.images [../images/00046.jpeg]Figure 12. Hexagrams: A) Traditional; B)Unicursal.Table 2. Unicursal Hexagrams.images [../images/00047.jpeg] THE LESSER RITUALOF THEHEXAGRAMThis ritual is to be performed after the “Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram.” 1. Stand upright, feet together, left arm at side, right across body, holdingWand or other weapon upright in the median line. Then face East and say:2. I.N.R.I.Yod, Nun, Resh, Yod.Virgo, Isis, Mighty Mother.Scorpio, Apophis, Destroyer.Sol, Osiris, Slain and Risen.Isis, Apophis, Osiris IAΩ.3. Extend the arms in the form of a cross, and say, The Sign of Osiris Slain.(See figure 3a [part0013.html#fig3a] on page 59 [part0013.html#page_59].)4. Raise the right arm to point upwards, keeping the elbow square, and lower theleft arm to point downwards, keeping the elbow square, while turning the headover the left shoulder looking down so that the eyes follow the left forearm,and say, The Sign of the Mourning of Isis. (See figure 3a [part0013.html#fig3a]on page 59 [part0013.html#page_59].)5. Raise the arms at an angle of sixty degrees to each other above the head,which is thrown back, and say, The Sign of Apophis and Typhon. (See figure 3a[part0013.html#fig3a] on page 59 [part0013.html#page_59].)6. Cross the arms on the breast, and bow the head and say, The Sign of OsirisRisen. (See figure 3a [part0013.html#fig3a] on page 59 [part0013.html#page_59].)7. Extend the arms again as in (3) and cross them again as in (6), sayingL.V.X., the Light of the Cross.8. With the magical weapon trace the Hexagram of Fire (see figure 13[part0015.html#fig13], page 111 [part0015.html#page_111]) in the East, saying,ARARITA images [../images/00048.jpeg]. This word consists of the initials of asentence which means “One is His beginning: One is His Individuality: HisPermutation is One.”This Hexagram consists of two equilateral triangles, both apices pointingupward. Begin at the top of the upper triangle and trace it in a dextrorotarydirection. The top of the lower should coincide with the central point of theupper triangle.9. Trace the Hexagram of Earth (see figure 13 [part0015.html#fig13], page 111[part0015.html#page_111]) in the South, saying ARARITA. This Hexagram has theapex of the lower triangle pointing downwards, and it should be capable ofinscription in a circle.10. Trace the Hexagram of Air (see figure 13 [part0015.html#fig13], below) inthe West, saying ARARITA. This Hexagram is like that of Earth; but the bases ofthe triangles coincide, forming a diamond.11. Trace the Hexagram of Water (see figure 13 [part0015.html#fig13], below) inthe North, saying ARARITA. This Hexagram has the lower triangle placed above theupper, so that their apices coincide.12. Repeat (1-7).The Banishing Ritual is identical, save that the direction of the Hexagrams mustbe reversed (see figure 13 [part0015.html#fig13], below).images [../images/00049.jpeg]Figure 13. Elemental Hexagrams adapted from Liber O, Part IV.To invoke or banish planets or zodiacal signs, the hexagram of Earth alone isused. Draw the Hexagram beginning from the point which is attributed to theplanet you are dealing with (see “777,” col. xxxiii). Thus to invoke Jupiterbegin from the right hand point of the lower triangle, dextrorotary andcomplete; then trace the upper triangle from its left hand point and complete.Trace the astrological sigil of the planet in the center of your hexagram.8[part0023.html#chap6-fn8]For the Zodiac use the hexagram of the planet which rules the sign you require(“777,” col. xxxviii) but draw the astrological sigil of the sign, instead ofthat of the planet. For Caput and Cauda Draconis use the lunar hexagram with thesigil of images [../images/00050.jpeg] or images [../images/00051.jpeg].To banish, reverse the hexagram.In all cases use a conjuration first with Ararita, and next with the name of theGod corresponding to the planet or sign you are dealing with.9[part0023.html#chap6-fn9]The Hexagrams pertaining to the planets are shown in figure 14[part0015.html#fig14] below.images [../images/00052.jpeg]Figure 14. Planetary Hexagrams adapted from Liber O, Part IV."},{"pageContent":"CHATTER SEVENimages [../images/00006.jpeg]THE THELEMIC RITUAL OF THE HEXAGRAMThus far then concerning the Pentagram, how it is the Cross, and its Virtue inthe Highest; but the Hexagram is for the most Part a Detail of the Formula ofthe Rose and Cross. Already have I shewed unto thee how the Most Holy Trinity isthe Yang; but the Spirit, and the Water (or Fluid) and the Blood, that bearWitness in the Inferior, are of the Yin. Thus the Operation of the Hexagramlieth wholly within the Order of one Plane, uniting indeed any Soul with itsImage, but not transcendentally, for its Effect is Cosmos, the Vau thatspringeth from the Union of the Yod and the Hé.—LIBER ALEPHThe Star Sapphire first appeared in 1913 as Chapter 36 of The Book of Lies. LikeThe Star Ruby and the rest of the material in that little book, it reflects theextraordinarily high level of illumination that characterize Crowley's work ofthat period. It contained the following commentary:The Star Saphire corresponds with the Star-Ruby of Chapter 25; 36 being thesquare of 6, as 25 is of 5.This chapter gives the real and perfect Ritual of the Hexagram.It would be improper to comment further upon an official ritual of the A images[../images/00030.jpeg] A images [../images/00030.jpeg]As I believe that a book about Thelemic Rituals would be incomplete without abasic introduction to The Star Sapphire, I feel it necessary to risk thecondemnation of those who maintain that any discussion of the ritual in print isimproper. Since the mid 1970s, at least a dozen works have been published thathave touched upon the subject of this ritual. While many have beenwell-intentioned efforts, others have contained what I consider to be grossdistortions and dubious interpretations. After reading them, I understand thewisdom of Crowley's commentary. Be that as it may, I think it is important thatI offer a brief introduction and a few notes.Crowley's autohagiography would have us believe that The Star Sapphire washastily written as the Thelemic version of the Hexagram Ritual, and that he hadno idea of any deeper implications. He relates how he received an unexpectedvisit from Theodor Reuss, the head of Ordo Templi Orientis, who accused him ofpublishing the Order's central secret, a technique of Sexual Magic. When Crowleyprotested he did no such thing, and that he didn't even know any secret ofSexual Magic, Reuss produced a copy of The Book of Lies and pointed to Chapter36, The Star Sapphire.Scholars debate the veracity of this story, but there is little dispute thatthis ceremony can easily be interpreted as a sex Magick ritual. Be that as itmay, I take exception to those who, with knowing winks and nudges, would have usbelieve that The Star Sapphire, or Liber XV, or a host of other Crowley rituals,are merely elaborate blinds for a variety of exotic sex acts.All Magick is sexual. Indeed, all life is sexual. It is either overt or implied,invoked or directed, stored or released. The Mass of the Roman Catholic Churchis every bit as much a pantomime of the sex act as the “Great Rite” of thewitches. The real question is “what is sex symbolic of?”The Star Sapphire is written as if it could be a complex choreographed act ofceremonial lovemaking. After all, the Hexagram is symbolic of the union ofopposites. In this ritual, the real challenge of the Magician lies in theability to concentrate, to visualize, receive, direct, and exchange the energiesrepresented by the various “Holy Hexagrams.” This work is performed on themagical plane which can be accessed by any number of techniques including (butnot limited to) sex. Whenever opposites are transcended and perfect union isrealized, a greater “something” is achieved. In lovemaking it is the ecstasy oforgasm; in initiation it can be the Knowledge and Conversation of the HolyGuardian Angel.I encourage the student who has mastered the traditional Hexagram rituals, tolearn The Star Sapphire. Practice it first as a nonsexual exercise, by drawingthe Unicursal or traditional Hexagrams (see figures 13 [part0015.html#fig13] and14 [part0015.html#fig14] on pages 111 [part0015.html#page_111] and 112[part0015.html#page_112] for examples). Study and meditate upon the implicationsof the signs, the words, and most importantly, the meanings of the four “HolyHexagrams.” Your labor will be well repaid.In Chapter 69 of The Book of Lies, Crowley gives us the only explicit definitionof the Holy Hexagram ever published. We reproduce it and Crowley's commentaryand hope the reader will find it useful.KEΦAΛHΞΘ1 [part0023.html#chap7-fn1]THE WAY TO SUCCEED—AND THE WAY TO SUCK EGGS!This is the Holy Hexagram.Plunge from the height, O God, and interlock with Man!Plunge from the height, O Man, and interlock with Beast!The Red Triangle is the Descending Tongue of grace; the Blue Triangle is theascending tongue of prayer.This Interchange, the Double Gift of Tongues, the Word of DoublePower—ABRAHADABRA!—is the sign of the GREAT WORK, for the GREAT WORK isaccomplished in Silence, And behold is not that Word equal to Cheth, that isCancer whose Sigil is images [../images/00053.jpeg]?This Work also eats up itself, accomplishes its own end, nourishes the worker,leaves no seed, is perfect in itself.Little children, love one another!Commentary (ΞΘ)2 [part0023.html#chap7-fn2]The key to the understanding of this chapter is given in the number and thetitle, the former being intelligible to all nations who employ Arabic figures,the latter only to experts in deciphering English puns.The chapter alludes to Levi's drawing of the Hexagram, and is a criticism of, orimprovement upon, it. In the ordinary Hexagram, the Hexagram of nature, the redtriangle is upward, like fire, and the blue triangle, downward, like water. Inthe magical Hexagram this is reversed: the descending red triangle is that ofHorus, a sign specially revealed by him personally, at the Equinox of the Gods.(It is the flame descending upon the altar, and licking up the burnt offering.)The blue triangle represents the aspiration, since blue is the colour ofdevotion, and the triangle, kinetically considered, is the symbol of directedforce.In the first three paragraphs this formation of the hexagram is explained; it isa symbol of the mutual separation of the Holy Guardian Angel and his client. Inthe interlocking is indicated the completion of the work.Paragraph 4 explains in slightly different language what we have said above, andthe scriptural image of tongues is introduced.In paragraph 5 the symbolism of tongues is further developed. Abrahadabra is ourprimal example of an interlocked word. We assume that the reader has thoroughlystudied that word in Liber D., etc. The sigil of Cancer links up this symbolismwith the number of the chapter.The remaining paragraphs continue the Gallic symbolism.

It is the raising of the complete man in a verticalstraight line.Any deviation from this line tends to become black magic. Any other operation isblack magic…if the magician needs to perform any other operation than this, itis only lawful in so far as it is a necessary preliminary to That One Work.—MAGICKNo aspect of the Magick of Thelema is more important than the Knowledge andConversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. It is the classic and universalpersonal religious experience. Until attained, no vision, ritual, invocation,evocation, conjuration, divination, yogic discipline, or magical practice can betruly efficacious or trustworthy.It is the unacknowledged central truth underlying the world's so-called “greatreligions” and the key to the understanding of the myths upon which they arefounded. The Holy Guardian Angel is the divine object of devotion of the BhaktiYogi; Krishna to the Hindu, and Christ to the Christian. No matter by what nameor in what form, the Holy Guardian Angel transfigures the devotee and bestowsbliss and an expanded consciousness which is prerequisite to any furtherspiritual experience or attainment. The Concept of the “H.G.A.” is ancient, butthe term—Holy Guardian Angel—as it is used in Magick is relatively new.In 1888 Golden Dawn Adept S. L. MacGregor-Mathers translated an extraordinaryfifteenth-century grimoire called The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin,the Mage. Purportedly written in 1458 by Abraham the Jew, (an enigmaticcharacter not without historical credentials in Central European courtintrigues), this remarkable work proved to be quite unlike any other magicaltext.While contemporary grimoires sent would-be magicians on endless scavenger hunts(tracking down bats' blood, eye of newt, etc.), in order to summon the power tobewitch the neighbor's cow or repel the evil eye, Abra-Melin introduces a novelidea. In order to receive real magical power, the magician must first actuallybecome an individual of superior spiritual integrity. To exercise god-likepowers, one must be god-like. Pious affirmations, and the parroting ofprecomposed magical incantations are useless unless the magician be truly a holyperson. This simple yet profound theory was a radical departure from theprimitive techniques of medieval European Magick, and elevated the art to alevel comparable to the yogic sciences of the East.The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin, the Mage postulates that everyindividual has a Holy Guardian Angel; a spiritual Being unique to each of us.This Being, whose true nature can only be adaquately explained by itself, ismore than a projection of our perfected Self. Indeed, until we have united withthis being, we do not even posesss the “equipment” necessary to comprehend itsnature.By assuming an attitude not unlike that of a love-sick suitor (who can donothing but pine for his beloved), we trigger within ourselves an arsenal ofinherent emotional responses which can be focused and amplified to such a degreethat union with this abstract lover is actually achieved. In the language of theQabalist, we are the Heh Final (5) of the Tetragrammaton, and the Holy GuardianAngel is the Vav (6). The H. G. A. is the Prince who awakens the sleepingPrincess. Once this union is realized, both we and our Angel are transformedinto a higher spiritual Being who is capable of truly mastering the unbalancedforces of the lower worlds. Only then are we eligible to receive personalspiritual guidance from the only reliable source in the universe…ourselves.The qabalistic environment of the H. G. A. is the sixth Sephirah, Tiphereth. Inthe A images [../images/00030.jpeg] A images [../images/00030.jpeg] gradedsystem of initiation, it represents the attainment of 5° = 6▫, the grade ofAdeptus Minor.The Abra-Melin operation is simple yet arduous. A house or a secured rusticenvironment is required. The magician must be sufficiently independent, andself-reliant enough to continue the operation without interruption for sixconsecutive months. Every two months the regimen of prayer, fasting, anddevotional activities increases in length and intensity, until near the end ofthe operation, the magician is in a state of perpetual, all-consuming hunger forthe Angel.Shortly after the Angel's arrival, the magician is instructed to call forth the“Four Great Princes of Evil,” and compel their obedience and extract oaths ofallegiance. The next day the same is done with the Eight Sub-Princes and so onuntil the entire population of the infernal realms have sworn their obedienceand allegiance to the new “H.G.A.ized” magician.I am often asked why the first thing the magician does after six months of piousaspiration for the “higher” spiritual reality, is to summon the denizens ofHell. The answer is simple. You are not operating in a vacuum. As above, sobelow. Your Angel has descended to vouchsafe you the grace of union. In order tocomplete the circuit and assure an uninterrupted flow of this divine current,you must in turn descend and transmit that same grace to the world beneath you.If you fail to redeem, control, and train the menagerie of your lower nature,those “demons” will resurface as soon as the glow of the Angel's presence hasfaded, and literally “play Hell” with you. In corporate terms, the workers willeventually revolt if management does not share with them the benefits ofincreased profits.Individuals who admit to attempting the Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin, the Mage arerare. It is rarer still to find credible individuals who maintain that they havesuccessfully executed the formal procedure. Israel Regardie once told me that,with the exception of Crowley, he knew of no one who successfully concluded anAbra-Melin operation.Crowley made two attempts before successfully completing it. He purchasedBoleskine House on the shore of Loch Ness for the expressed purpose ofperforming the operation. He was interrupted first in 1900, to go to Mather'said in Paris during the period of the collapse of the Golden Dawn, then in 1903,to marry his first wife, Rose Kelly.When he finally succeeded, it was under the most unbelievably difficultcircumstances. In 1906, while walking across China, he mentally performed theInvocation of the Holy Guardian Angel. The entire procedure was internalized;the temple, the furniture, the accoutrements—all visualized and projected uponthe screen of his mind and held there by intense concentration. The invocationsand the prayers were mentally rehearsed day after day. So focused was hisconcentration that at one point it took him several moments to realize that heand his pony had both fallen over a small cliff.His success proved to him that the basic formulae and procedures of theAbra-Melin operation were viable. It also became clear that as long as thegeneral program of “invoking often” and “enflaming” oneself in prayer wasstrictly followed, the particulars of the ceremony could vary considerably fromthose laid down in the 1458 text. It was during this period that he developedthe techniques that would form the basis of what he would consider “the mostpowerful and exalted of all my magical instructions,” Liber Samekh.On the Tree of Life, the Path of Samekh is the second segment of the MiddlePillar and connects the ninth Sephirah, Yesod (the Moon), and the sixthSephirah, Tiphereth (the Sun). In Hebrew the letter Samekh enumerates to 60 andmeans a prop or a tent peg or pole. In the traditional tarot, Samekh is theSagittarius card, Temperance, which shows Michael, the Archangel of Tiphereth,reconciling opposites by pouring Water on a Fire symbol (a lion) and Fire upon aWater symbol (an eagle). Above the Angel is the rainbow, the biblical symbol ofGod's covenant with man. This rainbow represents the Veil of Paroketh whichseparates Sephiroth 10, 9, 8, and 7 from the rest of the Tree of Life. The Pathof Samekh, like the arrow of Sagittarius, pierces the rainbow Veil of Parokethand shoots up the middle pillar to Tiphereth, the abode of the Holy GuardianAngel.The version of Liber Samekh with which we are most familiar was prepared in 1921for the benefit of Abbey of Thelema1 [part0023.html#chap8-fn1] resident FraterProgradior (Frank Bennett). Crowley had genuine affection for this courageousAustralian who had traveled to Cefalu for spiritual instruction. One afternoonwhile walking together to the beach, Crowley, in the course of casualconversation, said something to Bennett that instantly unknotted a personalunresolved internal conflict that had frustrated his spiritual advancement fornearly thirty years. This event triggered a trance-like state of exaltationwhich lasted three days.Crowley was so pleased with Bennett's receptivity to the program that he wantedto present him with a master ritual for the invocation of the Holy GuardianAngel. Liber Samekh is that gift.The scaffolding of the ceremony is Charles Wycliffe Goodwin's 1852 translationof a Fragment of a Graeco-Egyptian Work upon Magic, which Mathers included as apreliminary invocation in his translation of the Lesser Key of Solomon, theGoetia. It was informally known in the Golden Dawn as the “Bornless Ritual.” Tothis Crowley added an interpretation of the Barbarous Names “Entymologically orQabalistically determined and paraphrased in English.”So much for the skeleton of the ritual. Its soul is the running commentary andvisualization instructions of Points II and III. Here we find detaileddirections relevant to the magician's internalized processes. In no other workis Crowley so explicit as to what should be going on in the mind of themagician. The ritual is performed entirely on the magical plane in themagician's “Body of Light.” Everything is visualized and Crowley is clear onevery point.Also buried in the comments are treasures of magical data found nowhere else inCrowley's writings—fundamental definitions of terms, concrete explanations ofabstract concepts, and other gems that serve to fill many holes in the magicaleducation of even the most knowledgeable student.My only criticism of Liber Samekh deals not with the ritual but its originalformat. I must confess when I first began to study it, I concluded I would neverbe able to construct a workable ritual from the material. Important comments anddirections vital to the understanding of the ceremony are distractinglyscattered throughout the two essays (Points II and III) at the end of the ritualitself, and there are other aspects of its organization that make initial studyawkward and time consuming. Several years ago I decided to do something about itand organized two versions of Liber Samekh in my magical diary as follows:1) A Study Version—which includes Point I exactly as the original but underneatheach section and each line of the text, I copied the descriptive comments fromPoint II. This enabled my poor linear brain to actually see what Crowley istalking about.2) A Working Version—which serves as a practical script, displaying only thewords, directions, and diagrams necessary to actually memorize and beginrehearsing the ceremony.I have taken the liberty of presenting Liber Samekh as I have described above.For those who may object that this is a blasphemous act of savage editing, Iassure them that not one word of Liber Samekh has been removed, and that eachcomment from Point II is placed precisely where it is referenced by Crowley toPoint I.The Working Ritual which follows is clearly titled as an edited text and theaccompanying comments and diagrams are suggested from Crowley's notes.Before we procede to examine Liber Samekh, I feel it is necessary to say a fewwords about Crowley's intrepretation of the Barbarous Names which were part ofthe original Fragment of a Graeco-Egyptian Work upon Magic.Theoretically such “magick words” are efficacious because they areunintelligible. The rational mind is transcended, and the magical plane isaccessed as the magician babbles a string of strange sounding words and phrases.Interpreting the words would seem to defeat this process, and there are manypractitioners who feel this was an unnecessary exercise on Crowley's part.Personally, being familiar with Crowley's analysis of the Names has neitherhelped nor hindered my appreciation of the ritual. The Names still sound wierdand mysterious and establish a powerful and irrational magical environment.If any harm has been done by Crowley's treatment of the Names, it has not beento the serious student but to the diletante who, thumbing through the text, seesthings like “Thou Satan-Sun…” and “Satan, my Lord! The Lust of the Goat!” Morethan one “cult crime expert” has quoted this section (out of context) ontelevision talk shows in an attempt to prove Crowley was an evil satanist.For the dear reader who has come with me thus far, I think it is hardlynecessary for me to take any more time defending Crowley's honor. A carefulstudy of his work does an infinitely better job than I ever could. Even abeginning student of the Qabalah can easily see how Crowley arrived at thevarious compound meanings to the Names. He analyzed them by letter as if eachwhere spelled in Hebrew. To each Hebrew letter is attributed a meaning, anumber, a tarot trump, and a host of other qabalistic correspondences. A = Aleph= the letter of breath; R = Resh = the Sun card; therefore AR = “ O breathing,flowing Sun.”Satan usually pops up when the letter O takes center stage. O = Ayin = the Eye =Capricorn, the Goat = the Devil card. OOO = “Satan, thou Eye, thou Lust!”repeated three times. It's as simple as that.As for an initiated interpretation of the word Satan, Crowley gives us thefollowing from Chapter Five [part0014.html] of Magick in Theory and Practice.“O—The exalted “Devil” (also the other secret Eye) by the formula of theInitiation of Horus elsewhere described in detail. This “Devil” is called Satanor Shaitan, and regarded with horror by people who are ignorant of his formula,and, imagining themselves to be evil, accuse Nature herself of their ownphantasmal crime. Satan is Saturn, Set, Abrasax, Adad, Adonis, Attis, Adam,Adonai, etc. The most serious charge against him is only that he is the Sun inthe South. The Ancient Initiates, dwelling as they did in lands whose blood wasthe water of the Nile or the Euphrates, connected the South with life-witheringheat, and cursed that quarter where the solar darts were deadliest. Even in thelegend of Hiram, it is at high noon that he is stricken down and slain.Capricornus is moreover the sign which the Sun enters when he reaches hisextreme Southern declination at the Winter Solstice, the season of the death ofvegetation, for the folk of the Northern hemisphere. This gave them a secondcause of cursing the South. A third; the tyranny of hot, dry, poisonous winds;the menace of deserts of oceans dreadful because mysterious and impassable,these also were connected in their minds with the South. But to us, aware ofastronomical facts, this antagonism to the South is a silly superstition whichthe accidents of their local conditions suggested to our animistic ancestors. Wesee no enmity between Right and Left, Up and Down, and similar pairs ofopposites. These antitheses are real only as a statement of relation; they arethe conventions of an arbitrary device for representing our ideas in apluralistic symbolism based on duality. “Good” must be defined in terms of humanideals and instincts. “East” has no meaning except with reference to the earth'sinternal affairs; as an absolute direction in space it changes a degree everyfour minutes. “Up” is the same for no two men, unless one chance to be in theline joining the other with the centre of the earth. “Hard” is the privateopinion of our muscles. “True” is an utterly unintelligible epithet which hasproved refractory to the analysis of our ablest philosopher.“We have therefore no scruple in restoring the “devil-worship” of such ideas asthose which the laws of sound, and the phenomena of speech and hearing, compelus to connect with the group of “Gods” whose names are based upon ShT or D,vocalized by the free breath A. For these Names imply the qualities of courage,frankness, energy, pride, power and triumph; they are the words which expressthe creative and paternal will.“Thus “the Devil” is Capricornus, the Goat who leaps upon the loftiestmountains, the Godhead which, if it become manifest in man, makes him Aegipan,the All.“The Sun enters this sign when he turns to renew the year in the North. He isalso the vowel O, proper to roar, to boom, and to command, being a forciblebreath controlled by the firm circle of the mouth.“He is the Open Eye of the exalted Sun, before whom all shadows flee away: alsothat Secret Eye, which makes an image of its God, the Light, and gives it powerto utter oracles, enlightening the mind.“Thus, he is Man made God, exalted, eager; he has come consciously to his fullstature, and so is ready to set out on his journey to redeem the world. But hemay not appear in this true form; the Vision of Pan would drive men mad withfear. He must conceal Himself in his original guise.”images [../images/00009.jpeg]I hope that the reader will find the following more user-friendly versions ofLiber Samekh helpful adjuncts to their study of this most important ritual work.

He may burn the Cakes of Light, or the Incense of Abramelin; hemay be prepared by Liber CLXXV, the reading of Liber LXV, and by the practicesof Yoga. He may invoke HADIT by “wine and strange drugs” if he so will.2[part0023.html#chap8-fn2] He prepares the circle by the usual formulae ofBanishing and Consecration, etc.He recites Section A as a rehearsal before His Holy Guardian Angel of theattributes of that Angel. Each phrase must be realized with full concentrationof force, so as to make Samadhi as perfectly as possible upon the truthproclaimed.]1. Thee I invoke, the Bornless One.[He identifies his Angel with the Ain Soph, and the Kether thereof; oneformulation of Hadit in the boundless Body of Nuith.]2. Thee, that didst create the Earth and the Heavens.3. Thee, that didst create the Night and the Day.4. Thee, that didst create the darkness and the Light.[He asserts that His Angel has created (for the purpose of self-realizationthrough projection in conditioned Form) three pairs of opposites: a) The Fixedand the Volatile; b) The Unmanifested and the Manifest; and c) the Unmoved andthe Moved. Otherwise, the Negative and the Positive in respect of Matter, Mindand Motion.]5. Thou art ASAR UN-NEFER (Myself made perfect): Whom no man hath seen at anytime.[He acclaims his Angel as “Himself Made Perfect”; adding that this Individualityis inscrutable and inviolable. In the Neophyte Ritual of G images[../images/00030.jpeg] D images [../images/00030.jpeg] (as it is printed in TheEquinox I, II, for the old aeon) the Hierophant is the perfected Osiris, whobrings the candidate, the natural Osiris, to identity with himself. But in thenew Aeon the Hierophant is Horus (Liber CCXX, I. 49) therefore the Candidatewill be Horus too. What then is the formula of the initiation of Horus? It willno longer be that of the Man, through Death. It will be the natural growth ofthe Child. His experiences will no more be regarded as catastrophic. Theirhieroglyph is the Fool: the innocent and impotent Harpocrates Babe becomes theHorus Adult by obtaining the Wand. “Der reine Thor” seizes the Sacred Lance.Bacchus becomes Pan. The Holy Guardian Angel is the Unconscious CreatureSelf—the Spiritual Phallus. His knowledge and Conversation contributes occultpuberty. It is therefore advisable to replace the name Asar Un-nefer by that ofRa-Hoor-Khuit at the outset, and by that of one's own Holy Guardian Angel whenit has been communicated.]6. Thou art IA-BESZ (the Truth in Matter).[He hails Him as BESZ, the Matter that destroys and devours Godhead, for thepurpose of the Incarnation of any God.]7. Thou art IA-APOPHRASZ (the Truth in Motion).[He hails Him as APOPHRASZ, the Motion that destroys and devours Godhead, forthe purpose of the Incarnation of any God. The combined action of these twoDEVILS is to allow the God upon whom they prey to enter into enjoyment ofexistence through the Sacrament of dividual “Life” (Bread—the flesh of BESZ) and“Love” (Wine—the blood or venom of APOPHRASZ).]8. Thou has distinguished between the Just and the Unjust.[He acclaims His Angel as having “eaten of the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge ofGood and Evil”; otherwise having become wise (in the Dyad, Chokmah) to apprehendthe formula of Equilibrium which is now His own, being able to apply Himselfaccurately to His self-appointed environment.]9. Thou didst make the Female and the Male.[He acclaims His Angel as having laid down the Law of Love as the Magicalformula of the Universe, that He may resolve the phenomenal again into itsnoumenal phase by uniting any two opposites in ecstatic passion.]10. Thou didst produce the Seeds and the Fruit.[He acclaims His Angel as having appointed that this formula of Love shouldeffect not only the dissolution of the separateness of the Lovers into His ownimpersonal Godhead, but their co-ordination in a “Child” quintessentialized fromits parents to constitute a higher order of Being than theirs, so that eachgeneration is an alchemical progress towards perfection in the direction ofsuccessive complexities. As Line 9 asserts Involution, Line 10 assertsEvolution.]11. Thou didst form Men to love one another, and to hate one another.[He acclaims His Angel as having devised this method of self-realization; theobject of Incarnation is to obtain its reactions to its relations with otherincarnated Beings and to observe theirs with each other.]SECTION Aa.1. I am ANKH-F-N-KHONSU thy Prophet, unto Whom Thou didst commit Thy Mysteries,the Ceremonies of KHEM.[The Adept asserts his right to enter into conscious communication with HisAngel, on the ground that that Angel has Himself taught him the Secret Magick bywhich he may make the proper link. “Mosheh”3 [part0023.html#chap8-fn3] is M H,the formation, in Jechidah, Chiah, Neschamah, Ruach,—the Sephiroth from Ketherto Yesod—since 45 is Σ 1-9 while Sh, 300, is Σ 1-24, which superadds to theseNine an extra Fifteen numbers. (See in Liber D the meanings and correspondencesof 9, 15, 24, 45, 300, 345.)45 is moreover A D M, man. “Mosheh” is thus the name of man as a God-concealingForm. But in the Ritual let the Adept replace this “Mosheh” by his own motto asAdeptus Minor. For “Ishrael” let him prefer his own Magical Race, according tothe obligations of his Oaths to Our Holy Order! (The Beast 666 Himself used“Ankh-f-n-khonsu” and ‘Khem' in this section.)]2. Thou didst produce the moist and the dry, and that which nourisheth allcreated Life.[The Adept reminds his Angel that He has created That One Substance of whichHermes hath written in the Table of Emerald, whose virtue is to unite in itselfall opposite modes of Being, thereby to serve as a Talisman charged with theSpiritual Energy of Existence, an Elixir or Stone composed of the physical basisof Life. This Commemoration is placed between the two personal appeals to theAngel, as if to claim privilege to partake of this Eucharist which createth,sustaineth and redeemeth all things.]3. Hear Thou Me, for I am the Angel of PTAH-APOPHRASZ-RA (vide the Rubric): thisis Thy True Name, handed down to the Prophets of KHEM.[He now asserts that he is himself the “Angel” or messenger of his Angel; thatis, that he is a mind and body whose office is to receive and transmit the Wordof his Angel. He hails his Angel not only as “un-nefer” the Perfection of “Asar”himself as a man, but as Ptah-Apophrasz-Ra, the identity (Hadit) wrapped in theDragon (Nuith) and thereby manifested as a Sun (Ra-Hoor-Khuit). The “Egg” (orHeart) “girt with a Serpent” is a cognate symbol; the idea is thus expressedlater in the ritual. (See Liber LXV which expands this to the uttermost.)]SECTION B: AIR.[The Adept passes from contemplation to action in the sections now following Bto Gg. He is to travel astrally around the circle, making the appropriatepentagrams, sigils, and signs. His direction is widdershins. He thus makes threecurves, each covering three-fourths of the circle. He should give the sign ofthe Enterer on passing the Kiblah, or Direction of Boleskine. This picks up theForce naturally radiating from that point4 [part0023.html#chap8-fn4] andprojects it in the direction of the path of the magician. The sigils are thosegiven in The Equinox Vol. I, No. 7, Plate X outside the square; the signs thoseshewn in Vol. I, No. 2, Plate “The Signs of the Grades”. In these invocations heshould expand his girth and his stature to the utmost,5[part0023.html#chap8-fn5] assuming the form and the consciousness of theElemental God of the quarter. After this, he begins to vibrate the “BarbarousNames” of the Ritual.Now let him not only fill his whole being to the uttermost with the force of theNames; but let him formulate his Will, understood thoroughly as the dynamicaspect of his Creative Self, in an appearance symbolically apt, I say not in theform of a Ray of Light, of a Fiery Sword, or of aught save that bodily Vehicleof the Holy Ghost which is sacred to BAPHOMET, by its virtue that concealeth theLion and the Serpent that His Image may appear adorably upon the Earth for ever.Let then the Adept extend his Will beyond the Circle in this imagined Shape andlet it radiate with the Light proper to the Element invoked, and let each Wordissue along the shaft with passionate impulse, as if its voice gave commandthereto that it should thrust itself leapingly forward. Let also each Wordaccumulate authority, so that the Head of the Shaft may plunge twice as far forSecond Word as for the First, and Four Times for the Third as the Second, andthus to the end. Moreover, let the Adept fling forth his whole consciousnessthither. Then at the final Word, let him bring rushing back his Will withinhimself, steadily streaming, and let him offer himself to its points, as Artemisto PAN, that this perfectly pure concentration of the Element purge himthoroughly, and possess him with its passion.In this Sacrament being wholly at one with that Element, let the Adept utter theCharge “Hear me, and make”, etc. with strong sense that this unity with thatquarter of the Universe confers upon him the fullest freedom and privilegeappurtenant thereto.]Hear Me:AR (O breathing, flowing Sun!)ThIAF6 [part0023.html#chap8-fn6] (O Sun IAF!

The “Firmament” is theRuach, the ‘mental plane'; it is the realm of Shu, or Zeus, where revolves theWheel of the Gunas, the Three forms7 [part0023.html#chap8-fn7] of Being. TheAethyr is the “akasha”, the “Spirit”, the Aethyr of physics, which is theframework on which all forms are founded; it receives, records and transmits allimpulses without itself suffering mutation thereby. The “Earth” is the spherewherein the operation of these “fundamental” and aethyric forces appears toperception. “Under the Earth” is the world of those phenomena which inform thoseperceived projections, and determine their particular character. “Dry land” isthe place of dead “material things”, dry (i.e., unknowable) because unable toact on our minds. “Water” is the vehicle whereby we feel such things; “air”their menstruum wherein these feelings are mentally apprehended. It is called“whirling” because of the instability of thought, and the fatuity of reason, onwhich we are yet dependent for what we call “life”. “Rushing Fire” is the worldin which wandering thought burns up to swift-darting Will. These four stagesexplain how the non-Ego is transmuted into the Ego. A “Spell” of God is any formof consciousness, and a “Scourge” any form of action.The Charge, as a whole, demands for the Adept the control of every detail of theUniverse which His Angel has created as a means of manifesting Himself toHimself. It covers command of the primary projection of the Possible inindividuality, in the antithetical artifice which is the device of Mind, and ina balanced triplicity of modes or states of being whose combinations constitutethe characteristics of Cosmos. It includes also a standard of structure, arigidity to make reference possible. Upon these foundations of condition whichare not things in themselves, but the cannon to which things conform, is buildedthe Temple of Being, whose materials are themselves perfectly mysterious,inscrutable as the Soul, and like the Soul imagining themselves by symbols whichwe may feel, perceive, and adapt to our use without ever knowing the whole Truthabout them. The Adept sums up all these items by claiming authority over everyform of expression possible to Existence, whether it be a “spell” (idea) or a“scourge” (act) of “God”, that is, of himself. The Adept must accept every“spirit”, every “spell”, every “scourge”, as part of his environment, and makethem all “subject to” himself; that is, consider them as contributory causes ofhimself. They have made him what he is. They correspond exactly to his ownfaculties. They are all—ultimately—of equal importance. The fact that he is whathe is proves that each item is equilibrated. The impact of each new impressionaffects the entire system in due measure. He must therefore realize that everyevent is subject to him. It occurs because he had need of it. Iron rusts becausethe molecules demand oxygen for the satisfaction of their tendencies. They donot crave hydrogen; therefore combination with that gas is an event which doesnot happen. All experiences contribute to make us complete in ourselves. We feelourselves subject to them so long as we fail to recognize this; when we do, weperceive that they are subject to us. And whenever we strive to evade anexperience, whatever it may be, we thereby do wrong to ourselves. We thwart ourown tendencies. To live is to change; and to oppose change is to revolt againstthe law which we have enacted to govern our lives. To resent destiny is thus toabdicate our sovereignty and to invoke death. Indeed, we have decreed the doomof death for every breach of the law of life. And every failure to incorporateany impression starves the particular faculty which stood in need of it.This Section B invokes Air in the East, with a shaft of golden glory.]SECTION C: FIRE.[The adept now invokes Fire in the South; flame red are the rays that burst fromhis Verendum.]I invoke Thee, the Terrible and Invisible God: Who dwellest in the Void Place ofthe Spirit:AR-O-GO-GO-RU-ABRAO (Thou spiritual Sun!

As practice makes the Adept perfect in this Work it becomes automatic toattach all these complicated ideas and intentions to their correlated words andacts. When this is attained he may go deeper into the formula by amplifying itscorrespondences. Thus, he may invoke water in the manner of water, extending hiswill with majestic and irresistible motion, mindful of its impulse gravitation,yet with a suave and tranquil appearance of weakness. Again, he may apply theformula of water to its peculiar purpose as it surges back into his sphere,using it with conscious skill for the cleansing and calming of the receptive andemotional elements in his character, and for the solution or sweeping away ofthose tangled weeds of prejudice which hamper him from freedom to act as hewill.

At the same time he expandsthe Source of that Will—the secret symbol of Self—both about him and below, asif to affirm that Self, duplex as is its form, reluctant to acquiesce in itsfailure to coincide with the Sphere of Nuith. Let him now imagine, at the lastWord, that the Head of his will, where his consciousness is fixed, opens itsfissure (the Brahmarandra-Cakkra, at the junction of the cranial sutures) andexudes a drop of clear crystalline dew, and that this pearl is his Soul, avirgin offering to his Angel, pressed forth from his being by the intensity ofhis Aspiration.]Hear Me:AFT (Male-Female Spirits!)ABAFT (Male-Female Sires!)BAS-AUMGN (Ye that are Gods, going forth, uttering AUMGN.

He takes them to be the first formationin his consciousness of the nature of His Holy Guardian Angel.]1. This is the Lord of the Gods:[The “Gods” include all the conscious elements of his nature.]2. This is the Lord of the Universe:[The ‘Universe' includes all possible phenomena of which he can be aware.]3.

The“Voice” is necessary as the link between the Adept and his Angel. The Angel is“King”, the One who “can”, the “source of authority and the fount of honour”;also the King (or King's Son) who delivers the Enchanted Princess, and makes herhis Queen. He is “Ruler”, the “unconscious Will”; to be thwarted no more by theignorant and capricious false will of the conscious man. And He is “Helper”, theauthor of the infallible impulse that sends the Soul sweeping along the skies onits proper path with such impetus that the attraction of alien orbs is no longersufficient to swerve it. The “Hear me” clause is now uttered by the normal humanconsciousness, withdrawn to the physical body; the Adept must deliberatelyabandon his attainment, because it is not yet his whole being which burns upbefore the Beloved.]SECTION G: SPIRIT.[The Adept, though withdrawn, shall have maintained the Extension of his Symbol.He now repeats the signs as before, save that he makes the Passive InvokingPentagram of Spirit. He concentrates his consciousness within his Twin-Symbol ofSelf, and endeavours to send it to sleep. But if the operation be performedproperly, his Angel shall have accepted the offering of Dew, and seized withfervour upon the extended symbol of Will towards Himself. This then shall Heshake vehemently with vibrations of love reverberating with the Words of theSection. Even in the physical ears of the adept there shall resound an echothereof, yet he shall not be able to describe it. It shall seem both louder thanthunder, and softer than the whisper of the night-wind. It shall at once beinarticulate, and mean more than he hath ever heard.Now let him strive with all the strength of his Soul to withstand the Will ofhis Angel, concealing himself in the closest cell of the citadel ofconsciousness. Let him consecrate himself to resist the assault of the Voice andthe Vibration until his consciousness faint away into Nothing. For if thereabide unabsorbed even one single atom of the false Ego, that atom should stainthe virginity of the True Self and profane the Oath; then that atom should be soinflamed by the approach of the Angel that it should overwhelm the rest of themind, tyrannize over it, and become an insane despot to the total ruin of therealm.But, all being dead to sense, who then is able to strive against the Angel? Heshall intensify the stress of His Spirit so that His loyal legions ofLion-Serpents leap from the ambush, awakening the adept to witness their Willand sweep him with them in their enthusiasm, so that he consciously partakestheir purpose, and sees in its simplicity the solution of all his perplexities.Thus then shall the Adept be aware that he is being swept away through thecolumn of his Will Symbol, and that His Angel is indeed himself, with intimacyso intense as to become identity, and that not in a single Ego, but in everyunconscious element that shares in that manifold uprush.This rapture is accompanied by a tempest of brilliant light, almost always, andalso in many cases by an outburst of sound, stupendous and sublime in all cases,though its character may vary within wide limits.11 [part0023.html#chap8-fn11]The spate of stars shoots from the head of the Will-Symbol, and is scatteredover the sky in glittering galaxies. This dispersion destroys the concentrationof the adept, whose mind cannot master such mulitiplicy of majesty; as a rule,he simply sinks stunned into normality, to recall nothing of his experience buta vague though vivid impression of complete release and ineffable rapture.Repetition fortifies him to realize the nature of his attainment; and his Angel,the link once made, frequents him, and trains him subtly to be sensitive to hisHoly presence, and persuasion. But it may occur, especially after repeatedsuccess, that the Adept is not flung back into his mortality by the explosion ofthe Star-spate, but identified with one particular “Lion-Serpent”, continuingconscious thereof until it finds its proper place in Space, when its secret selfflowers forth as a truth, which the Adept may then take back to earth with him.This is but a side issue. The main purpose of the Ritual is to establish therelation of the subconscious self with the Angel in such a way that the Adept isaware that his Angel is the Unity which expresses the sum of the Elements ofthat Self, that his normal consciousness contains alien enemies introduced bythe accidents of environment, and that his Knowledge and Conversation of HisHoly Guardian Angel destroys all doubts and delusions, confers all blessings,teaches all truth, and contains all delights. But it is important that the Adeptshould not rest in mere inexpressible realization of his rapture, but rousehimself to make the relation submit to analysis, to render it in rational terms,and thereby enlighten his mind and heart in a sense as superior to fanaticalenthusiasm as Beethoven's music is to West African war-drums.]Hear Me:IEOU (Indwelling Sun of Myself)PUR (Thou Fire!

But their death is rather a going forth to renew their life throughlove. He then, by conscious comprehension of them separately and together,becomes the “Angel” of his Angel, as Hermes is the Word of Zeus, whose own voiceis Thunder. Thus in this section the adept utters articulately so far as wordsmay, what his Angel is to Himself. He says this, with his Scin-Laeca whollywithdrawn into his physical body, constraining His Angel to indwell his heart.]1. I am He! the Bornless Spirit! having sight in the feet: Strong, and theImmortal Fire![“I am He” asserts the destruction of the sense of separateness between self andSelf. It affirms existence, but of the third person only. “The Bornless Spirit”is free of all space, “having sight in the feet” that they may choose their ownpath. “Strong” is GBR, the magician escorted by the Sun and the Moon (See LiberD and Liber 777). The “Immortal Fire” is the creative Self; impersonal energycannot perish, no matter what forms it assumes. Combustion is Love.]2. I am He! the Truth![“Truth” is the necessary relation of any two things; therefore, although itimplies duality, it enables us to conceive of two things as being one thing suchthat it demands to be defined by complementals. Thus, an hyperbola is a simpleidea, but its construction exacts two curves.]3. I am He! Who hate that evil should be wrought in the World![The Angel, as the adept knows him, is a being in Tiphereth, which obscuresKether. The Adept is not officially aware of the higher Sephiroth. He cannotperceive, like the Ipsissimus, that all things soever are equally illusion andequally Absolute. He is in Tiphereth, whose office is Redemption, and hedeplores the events which have caused the apparent Sorrow from which he has justescaped. He is also aware, even in the height of his ecstasy, of the limits anddefects of his attainment.]4. I am He, that lighteneth and thundereth![This refers to the phenomena which accompany his Attainment.]5.

Then let the Eleventh Moon be consecrated wholly tothis Work; let him be instant in continual ardour, dismissing all but his sheerneeds to eat and sleep.22 [part0023.html#chap8-fn22] For know that the trueFormula23 [part0023.html#chap8-fn23] whose virtue sufficed the Beast in thisAttainment, was thus:INVOKE OFTEN24 [part0023.html#chap8-fn24]So may all men come at last to the Knowledge and Conversation of the HolyGuardian Angel: thus sayeth the Beast, and prayeth His own Angel that this bookbe as a burning Lamp, and as a living Spring, for Light and Life to them thatread therein.666POINTIIISCHOLION ON SECTIONS G & GgThe Adept who has mastered this Ritual, successfully realizing the full importof this controlled rapture, ought not to allow his mind to loosen its grip onthe astral imagery of the Star-spate, Will-Symbol, or Soul-symbol, or even toforget its duty to the body and the sensible surroundings. Nor should he omit tokeep his Body of Light in close touch with the phenomena of its own plane, sothat its privy consciousness may fulfil its proper functions of protecting hisscattered ideas from obsession.But he should have acquired, by previous practice, the faculty of detachingthese elements of his consciousness from their articulate centre, so that theybecome (temporarily) independent responsible units, capable of receivingcommunications from headquarters at will, but perfectly able 1) to take care ofthemselves without troubling their chief, and 2) to report to him at the propertime. In a figure, they must be like subordinate officers, expected to displayself-reliance, initiative, and integrity in the execution of the Orders of theDay.The Adept should therefore be able to rely on these individual minds of his tocontrol their own conditions without interference from himself for the timerequired, and to recall them in due course, receiving an accurate report oftheir adventures.This being so, the Adept will be free to concentrate his deepest self, that partof him which unconsciously orders his true Will, upon the realization of hisHoly Guardian Angel. The absence of his bodily, mental and astral consciousnessis indeed cardinal to success, for it is their usurpation of his attention whichhas made him deaf to his Soul, and his preoccupation with their affairs that hasprevented him from perceiving that Soul.The effect of the Ritual has been:a) to keep them so busy with their own work that they cease to distract him;b) to separate them so completely that his soul is stripped of its sheaths;c) to arouse in him an enthusiasm so intense as to intoxicate and anesthetizehim, that he may not feel and resent the agony of this spiritual vivisection,just as bashful lovers get drunk on the wedding night, in order to brazen outthe intensity of shame which so mysteriously coexists with their desire;d) to concentrate the necessary spiritual forces from every element, and flingthem simultaneously into the aspiration towards the Holy Guardian Angel; ande) to attract the Angel by the vibration of the magical voice which invokes Him.The method of the Ritual is thus manifold.There is firstly an analysis of the Adept, which enables him to calculate hiscourse of action. He can decide what must be banished, what purified, whatconsecrated. He can then concentrate his will upon its one essential element,overcoming its resistance-which is automatic, like a physiological reflex—bydestroying inhibitions through his ego—overwhelming enthusiasm.25[part0023.html#chap8-fn25] The other half of the work needs no such complexeffort; for his Angel is simple and unperplexed, ready at all times to respondto rightly ordered approach.But the results of the Ritual are too various to permit of rigid description.One may say that, presuming the union to be perfect, the Adept need not retainany memory soever of what has occurred. He may be merely aware of a gap in hisconscious life, and judge of its contents by observing that his nature has beensubtly transfigured. Such an experience might indeed be the proof of perfection.If the Adept is to be any wise conscious of his Angel it must be that some partof his mind is prepared to realize the rapture, and to express it to itself inone way or another. This involves the perfection of that part, its freedom fromprejudice and the limitations of rationality so-called.For instance: one could not receive the illumination as to the nature of lifewhich the doctrine of evolution should shed, if one is passionately persuadedthat humanity is essentially not animal, or convinced that causality isrepugnant to reason. The Adept must be ready for the utter destruction of hispoint of view on any subject, and even that of his innate conception of theforms and laws of thought.26 [part0023.html#chap8-fn26] Thus he may find thathis Angel consider his “business” or his “love” to be absurd trifles; also thathuman ideas of “time” are invalid, and human “laws” of logic applicable only tothe relations between illusions.Now the Angel will make contact with the Adept at any point that is sensitive toHis influence. Such a point will naturally be one that is salient in the Adept'scharacter, and also one that is, in the proper sense of the word, pure.27[part0023.html#chap8-fn27]Thus an artist, attuned to appreciate plastic beauty is likely to receive avisual impression of his Angel in a physical form which is sublimelyquintessential of his ideal. A musician may be rapt away by majestic melodiessuch as he never hoped to hear. A philosopher may attain apprehension oftremendous truths, the solution of problems that had baffled him all his life.Conformably with this doctrine, we read of illuminations, experienced bysimple-minded men, such as a workman who “saw God” and likened Him to “aquantity of little pears.” Again, we know that ecstasy, impinging uponunbalanced minds, inflames the idolized idea, and produces fanatical faithfierce even to frenzy, with intolerance and insanely disordered energy which isyet so powerful as to effect the destinies of empires.But the phenomena of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angelare a side issue; the essence of the Union is the intimacy. Their intimacy (orrather identity) is independent of all partial forms of expression; at its bestit is therefore as inarticulate as Love.The intensity of the consummation will more probably compel a sob or a cry, somenatural physical gesture of animal sympathy with the spiritual spasm. This is tobe criticized as incomplete self-control. Silence is nobler.In any case the Adept must be in communion with his Angel, so that his Soul issuffused with sublimity, whether intelligible or not in terms of intellect. Itis evident that the stress of such spiritual possession must tend to overwhelmthe soul, especially at first. It actually suffers from the excess of itsecstasy, just as extreme love produces vertigo. The soul sinks and swoons. Suchweakness is fatal alike to its enjoyment and its apprehension. “Be strong! thencanst thou bear more rapture!” sayeth the Book of the Law.28[part0023.html#chap8-fn28]The Adept must therefore play the man, arousing himself to harden his soul.To this end, I, the Beast have made trial and proof of divers devices. Of thesethe most potent is to set the body to strive with the soul. Let the muscles takegrip on themselves as if one were wrestling. Let the jaw and mouth, inparticular, be tightened to the utmost. Breathe deeply, slowly, yet strongly.Keep mastery over the mind by muttering forcibly and audibly. But lest suchmuttering tend to disturb communion with the Angel, speak only His Name. Untilthe Adept have heard that Name, therefore, he may not abide in the perfectpossession of his Beloved. His most important task is thus to open his ears tothe voice of his Angel, that he may know him, how he is called. For hearken!this Name, understood rightly and fully, declareth the nature of the Angel inevery point, wherefore also that Name is the formula of the perfection to whichthe Adept must aspire, and also of the power of Magick by virtue whereof he mustwork.He then that is as yet ignorant of that Name, let him repeat a word worthy ofthis particular Ritual. Such are Abrahadabra, the Word of the Aeon, whichsignifieth “The Great Work accomplished”; and Aumgn interpreted in Part III ofBook 4;29 [part0023.html#chap8-fn29] and the name of THE BEAST, for that Hisnumber showeth forth this Union with the Angel, and His Work is no other than tomake all men partakers of this Mystery of the Mysteries of Magick.So then saying this word or that, let the Adept wrestle with his Angel andwithstand Him, that he may constrain Him to consent to continue in communionuntil the consciousness becomes capable of clear comprehension, and of accuratetransmission30 [part0023.html#chap8-fn30] of the transcendent Truth of theBeloved to the heart that holds him.The firm repetition of one of these Words ought to enable the Adept to maintainthe state of Union for several minutes, even at first.In any case he must rekindle his ardour, esteeming his success rather as anencouragement to more ardent aspiration than as a triumph. He should increasehis efforts.Let him beware of the ‘lust of result', of expecting too much, of losing courageif his first success is followed by a series of failures.For success makes success seem so incredible that one is apt to create aninhibition fatal to subsequent attempts. One fears to fail; the fear intrudesupon the concentration and so fulfils its own prophecy. We know how too muchpleasure in a love affair makes one afraid to disgrace oneself on the next fewoccasions; indeed, until familiarity has accustomed one to the idea that one'slover has never supposed one to be more than human. Confidence returnsgradually. Inarticulate ecstasy is replaced by a more sober enjoyment of theelements of the fascination.Just so one's first dazzled delight in a new landscape turns, as one continuesto gaze, to the appreciation of exquisite details of the view. At first theywere blurred by the blinding rush of general beauty; they emerge one by one asthe shock subsides, and passionate rapture yields to intelligent interest.In the same way the Adept almost always begins by torrential lyrics panting outmystical extravagances about “ineffable love,” “unimaginable bliss,”“inexpressible infinities of illimitable utterness.”31[part0023.html#chap8-fn31] He usually loses his sense of proportion, of humour,of reality, and of sound judgment. His ego is often inflated to bursting point,till he would be abjectly ridiculous if he were not so pitifully dangerous tohimself and others. He also tends to take his new-found “truths of illumination”for the entire body of truth, and insists that they must be as valid and vitalfor all men as they happen to be for himself.It is wise to keep silence about those things “unlawful to utter” which one mayhave heard “in the seventh heaven.” This may not apply to the sixth.The Adept must keep himself in hand, however tempted to make a new heaven and anew earth in the next few days by trumpeting his triumphs. He must give time achance to redress his balance, sore shaken by the impact of the Infinite.As he becomes adjusted to intercourse with his Angel, he will find hispassionate ecstasy develop a quality of peace and intelligibility which addspower, while it informs and fortifies his mental and moral qualities instead ofobscuring and upsetting them. He will by now have become able to converse withhis Angel, impossible as it once seemed; for he now knows that the storm ofsound which he supposed to be the Voice was only the clamour of his ownconfusions. The “infinity” nonsense was born of his own inability to thinkclearly beyond his limits, just as a Bushman, confronted by numbers above five,can only call them “many.”The truth told by the Angel, immensely as it extends the horizon of the Adept,is perfectly definite and precise. It does not deal in ambiguities andabstractions. It possesses form, and confesses law, in exactly the same way anddegree as any other body of truth. It is to the truth of the material andintellectual spheres of man very much what the Mathematics of Philosophy withits “infinite series” and “Cantorian continuity” is to school-boy arithmetic.Each implies the other, though by that one may explore the essential nature ofexistence, and by this a pawnbroker's profits.This then is the true aim of the Adept in this whole operation, to assimilatehimself to his Angel by continual conscious communion. For his Angel is anintelligible image of his own true Will, to do which is the whole of the law ofhis Being.Also the Angel appeareth in Tiphereth, which is the heart of the Ruach, and thusthe Centre of Gravity of the Mind. It is also directly inspired from Kether, theultimate Self, through the Path of the High Priestess, or initiated intuition.Hence the Angel is in truth the Logos or articulate expression of the wholeBeing of the Adept, so that as he increases in the perfect understanding of Hisname, he approaches the solution of the ultimate problem: Who he himself trulyis.Unto this final statement the Adept may trust his Angel to lead him; for theTiphereth-consciousness alone is connected by paths with the various parts ofhis mind.32 [part0023.html#chap8-fn32] None therefore save He hath the knowledgerequisite for calculating the combinations of conduct which will organize andequilibrate the forces of the Adept, against the moment when it becomesnecessary to confront the Abyss. The Adept must control a compact and coherentmass if he is to make sure of hurling it from him with a clean-cut gesture.I, The Beast 666, lift up my voice and swear that I myself have been broughthither by mine Angel. After that I had attained unto the Knowledge andConversation of Him by virtue of mine ardour towards Him, and of this Ritualthat I bestow upon men my fellows, and most of His great Love that He beareth tome, yea, verily, He led me to the Abyss; He bade me fling away all that I hadand all that I was; and He forsook me in that Hour. But when I came beyond theAbyss, to be reborn within the womb of BABALON, then came he unto me abiding inmy virgin heart, its Lord and Lover!Also He made me a Magus, speaking through His Law, the Word of the new Aeon, theAeon of the Crowned and Conquering Child.33 [part0023.html#chap8-fn33] Thus hefulfilled my will to bring full freedom to the race of Men.Yea, he wrought also in me a Work of Wonder beyond this, but in this matter I amsworn to hold my peace.images [../images/00054.jpeg]A figure from Aleister Crowley's Magick (York Beach, ME: Samuel Weiser, 1974),p. 51.The above figure is an example of a working script of Liber Samekh, whichincludes only the words, directions, and diagrams necessary to memorize andrehearse the ceremony.

Having seen this satisfactorily, he prostrates himself inadoration.When consciousness begins to return, he uses the final formula to raise thatconsciousness in the Shivalingam, springing to his feet at the moment of unitinghimself with it, and lastly uttering that supreme song of the initiatebeginning: “I am He, the Bornless Spirit, having sight in the feet; strong andthe Immortal Fire!”(Thus performed, the invocation means about half an hour of the most intensemagical work imaginable—a minute of it would represent the equivalent of abouttwelve hours of Asana.)35 [part0023.html#chap8-fn35]—EQUINOX VOL.

The only thing new and revolutionary about it is the“worshiper's” relation to the Sun. It doesn't take very long for the modernstudent of comparative religion to see the countless similarities and parallelsinherent in the world's so-called Great Religions. We might even say (if weallow ourselves the emancipation of a truly open mind), that the religions ofthe past are really only aspects of one religion whose universal object ofworship is the Sun, and whose ceremonies, observances, and holy days are basedupon the recurring yearly passion play that is the solar calendar.Terrestrial life pantomimes the Sun's life-creating qualities in thereproductive capabilities of the each organism. Our ancestors drew a directparallel between the Sun and the phallus, and between sunlight, blood, andsemen. This correlation assumes increasingly profound dimensions as we apply ourgreater understanding of astronomy, physics, and medicine to this great evolvingreligion.The simple “truth” of the death of the Sun was destroyed by the “truth” of theheliocentric system, which is destroyed by the “truth” that our solar systemrevolves around a central something which may very well be a black andinscrutable negative dimension. Theoretically all of this originated as acompact, pre-existent, negative singularity (which for some reason could notcontain itself), and in all likelihood will someday withdraw everything backinto nothingness.Meanwhile we are discovering that everything we were, are, and shall be isencoded upon a chemical “chip” called DNA, which impresses itself upon ourcells, and flows like an eternal river through the blood of infinite generationswhose most important function is to serve as organic “ark” for this evolvingsuperlife.All of the Thelemic rituals express the formulae of the new solar consciousness,but two in particular incorporate the Sun itself as the central element ofceremony: Liber Resh and The Mass of the Phoenix.Resh is a simple series of four adorations which are performed at dawn, noon,sunset, and midnight. These are formatted as classic Egyptian adorations, butcustomized to satisfy Crowley's idea of the new magical formulae. Resh serves asan excellent form of background concentration which requires us to acknowledgeour magical relationship with the Sun at least four times in our busy day.The object of this practice is firstly to remind the aspirant at regularintervals of the Great Work; secondly, to bring him into conscious personalrelation with the centre of our system; and thirdly, for advanced students, tomake actual magical contact with the spiritual energy of the sun and thus todraw actual force from him.1 [part0023.html#chap9-fn1]The Mass of the Phoenix is a Eucharistic ceremony created to be celebrated atsunset in order to fortify the magician's awareness of the Sun during itsnighttime journey. Like The Star Ruby and The Star Sapphire, it first appearedin print in The Book Of Lies where it was positioned as Chapter 44.2[part0023.html#chap9-fn2]Because there appears to be an element of self-mutilation in The Mass of thePhoenix, there continues to be considerable misunderstanding about the ritual,and outrageous statements by extremists on both ends of the magical spectrumhave caused many serious students to avoid it altogether. Crowley wrote inchapter 20 of Magick in Theory and Practice, that the Mass of the Phoenix“…should be performed daily at sunset by every magician.” Did he really expectus to risk our health by slashing our chests open each evening?I confess that as an overzealous young fool, I celebrated The Mass of thePhoenix by using a surgeon's scalpel in place of the Burin to “…make the propersign.” To my amazement the blade painlessly disappeared almost entirely into theflesh of my chest before I realized what was happening. The cut was extremelyclean, and for a moment there was no bleeding whatsoever. Then it came…quicklyrunning in a thick stream over the front of my body. Determined to complete theceremony, I tried to “Staunch the blood” with the Cake of Light,3[part0023.html#chap9-fn3] only to have it disintegrate in my fingers in a floodof warm blood. The sun was half obscured by the horizon, and its soft orangelight bathed my blood-soaked chest and fingers. I bolted for the bathroom as Inervously parroted “…with mirth I now go forth, and with thanksgiving, to do mypleasure on the earth among the legions of the living.” I was frightened,agitated, injured, and embarrassed. I did not feel very spiritual.Let the blood of my sacrifice wash you clean of any temptation to do such astupid thing to yourself!It is obvious from the text that the magician is to actually draw blood in orderto consecrate the Cake of Light before consuming it. But nowhere is it indicatedthat pain, scarring, or injury is a required element of the ceremony. It is aEucharist, not a ritual of self-mutilation.An excellent way to “make the proper sign”4 [part0023.html#chap9-fn4] is to usea machinist's scribe (a rod of steel tapered to an extremely sharp point). It iseasy to sterilize and, if one is careful, it is possible to lightly scratch thesymbol on the flesh. This will remain visible for several hours. By applyingjust a little more pressure to a small area of the scratch, the tool will breakthe skin just enough for a tiny drop of blood to rise to the surface. Thisfulfills the literal interpretation of the ritual without harm to the magician,and allows him or her to concentrate on the real purpose of the ceremony, namelya solar Eucharist.The ideal setting for The Mass of the Phoenix is outdoors, or before a windowopened to accommodate a view of the setting Sun. The ritual is so brief that themagician can begin as the Sun first touches the horizon and have time to“charge” the blood on the chest with the last rays of the setting Sun. Thissolar-consecrated Holy Blood is then trapped in the Cake of Light and eaten bythe magician. When the Mass is over, the essence of the Sun is safely sheltereduntil dawn in the body of the magician. If performed regularly and over a periodof time, the body of the magician will be renewed, cell by cell, by this divinesolar nourishment.It is rare for someone to have a lifestyle which would accommodate the perpetualcelebration of The Mass of the Phoenix, but it is an excellent component in thedaily regimen of a Magical Retirement. Liber Resh is so short that it can beperformed, at least in an informal format, almost anywhere, and Crowley urgedhis students to never omit its observance.5 [part0023.html#chap9-fn5] LIBER RESH VEL HELIOSSUB FIGURA CC6 [part0023.html#chap9-fn6] 0.

Lastly, at Midnight, let him greet the Sun, facing North giving the sign ofhis grade.

And after each of these invocations thou shalt give the sign of silence, andafterward thou shalt perform the adoration that is taught thee by thy Superior.And then do thou compose Thyself to holy meditation.6. Also it is better if in these adorations thou assume the God-form of Whomthou adorest, as if thou didst unite with Him in the adoration of That which isbeyond Him.7. Thus shalt thou ever be mindful of the Great Work which thou hast undertakento perform, and thus shalt thou be strengthened to pursue it unto the attainmentof the Stone of the Wise, the Summum Bonum, True Wisdom and Perfect Happiness.AUTHOR'S NOTES AND COMMENTS1. The imagery is that of the Egyptian Solar barge (bark), which every eveningat sunset, carries the glorified Osiris from the western horizon through theland of the Dead, and brings the eternal Sun safely under the Earth to dawn onthe eastern horizon each morning as Ra.Tahuti (Thoth), the Ibis-headed psychopomp of the Egyptians, is stationed at theprow, and Horus, the Son of the Sun, acts as divine helmsman.2. Ahathoor—the Egyptian Venus whose month of November (Scorpio) marks the crossquarter of the year when darkness triumphs over the light.3. Tum, Tmu—God of the West, the setting Sun—God of the Sun at night.4. Khephra—As the Egyptian desert scarab perpetually rolls a ball of dung inwhich her eggs are stored, so too Khephra, the celestial scarab, rolls thesphere of the Sun across the heavens.5. According to some accounts, Crowley taught residents of the Abbey of Thelemato recite the following portions of The Book of the Law as the adorations:Unity uttermost showed! I adore the might of Thy breath,Supreme and terrible God, Who makest the gods and deathTo tremble before Thee:— I, I adore thee!Appear on the throne of Ra! Open the ways of the Khu!Lighten the ways of the Ka! The ways of the Khabs run throughTo stir me or still me! Aum! let it fill me!The light is mine; its rays consume Me: I have made a secret doorInto the House of Ra and Tum, Of Khephra and of Ahathoor.I am thy Theban, O Mentu, The prophet Ankh-af-na-khonsu!By Bes-na-Maut my breast I beat; By wise Ta-Nech I weave my spell.Show thy star-splendour, O Nuit! Bid me within thine House to dwell,O wingèd snake of light, Hadit! Abide with me, Ra-Hoor-Khuit!7 [part0023.html#chap9-fn7]6.

Worship, i.e., identify thyself with, the Khabs, the secret Light within theHeart. Within this, again, unextended, is Hadit.This is the first practice of Meditation (ccxx. I. 6 and 21).2. Adore and understand the Rim of the Stélé of Revealing.Above, the gemmèd azure isThe naked splendour of Nuit;She bends in ecstasy to kissThe secret ardours of Hadit.This is the first practice of Intelligence (ccxx. I. 14).3. Avoid any act of choice or discrimination.This is the first practice of Ethics (ccxx. I. 22).4. Consider of six and fifty that 50 ÷ 6 = 0.12.0 the circumference, Nuit.• the centre, Hadit.1 the unity proceeding, Ra-Hoor-Khuit.2 the world of illusion.Nuit thus comprehends All in None.Also 50 + 6 = 56 = 5 + 6 = 11, the key of all Rituals.And 50 × 6 = 300, the Spirit of the Child within.(Note Nimages [../images/00062.jpeg] 72, the Shemhamphorash and the Quinaries ofthe Zodiac, etc.)This is the second practice of Intelligence (ccxx. I. 24, 25).5. The Result of this Practice is the Consciousness of the Continuity ofExistence, the Omnipresence of the Body of Nuit.In other words, the Aspirant is conscious only of the Infinite Universe as asingle Being. [Note for this the importance of Paragraph 3.—Ed.]3[part0023.html#chap10-fn3]This is the first lndication of the Nature of the Result (ccxx. I. 26).6. Meditate upon Nuit as the Continuous One resolved into None and Two as thephases of her being. [For the Universe being self-contained must be capable ofexpression by the formula (n – n) = 0. For if not, let it be expressed by theformula n – m p. That is, the Infinite moves otherwise than within itself, whichis absurd.—Ed.]This is the second practice of Meditation (ccxx. I. 27).7. Meditate upon the facts of Samadhi on all planes, the liberation of heat inchemistry, joy in natural history, Ananda in religion, when two things join tolose themselves in a third.This is the third practice of Meditation (ccxx. I. 28, 29, 30).8. Let the Aspirant pay utmost reverence to the Authority of the A images[../images/00030.jpeg] A images [../images/00030.jpeg] and follow Itsinstructions, and let him swear a great Oath of Devotion unto Nuit.This is the second practice of Ethics (ccxx. I. 32).9. Let the Aspirant beware of the slightest exercise of his will against anotherbeing. Thus, lying is a better posture than sitting or standing, as it opposesless resistance to gravitation. Yet his first duty is to the force nearest andmost potent; e.g. he may rise to greet a friend.This is the third practice of Ethics (ccxx. I. 41).10. Let the Aspirant exercise his will without the least consideration for anyother being. This direction cannot be understood, much less accomplished, untilthe previous practice has been perfected.This is the fourth practice of Ethics (ccxx. I. 42, 43, 44).11. Let the Aspirant comprehend that these two practices are identical.This is the third practice of Intelligence (ccxx. I. 45).12. Let the Aspirant live the Life Beautiful and Pleasant. For this freedom hathhe won. But let each act, especially of love, be devoted wholly to his truemistress, Nuit.This is the fifth practice of Ethics (ccxx. I. 51, 52, 61, 63).13. Let the Aspirant yearn toward Nuit under the stars of Night, with a lovedirected by his Magical Will, not merely proceeding from the heart.This is the first practice of Magick Art (ccxx. I. 57).14. The Result of this Practice in the subsequent life of the Aspirant is tofill him with unimaginable joys: to give him certainty concerning the nature ofthe phenomenon called death; to give him peace unutterable, rest, and ecstasy.This is the second Indication of the Nature of the Result (ccxx. I. 58).15. Let the Aspirant prepare a perfume of resinous woods and gums, according tohis inspiration.This is the second practice of Magick Art (ccxx. I. 59).16. Let the Aspirant prepare a Pantacle, as follows:Inscribe a circle within a Pentagram, upon a ground square or of such otherconvenient shape as he may choose. Let the circle be scarlet, the Pentagramblack, the ground royal blue studded with golden stars.Within the circle, at its centre, shall be painted a sigil that shall berevealed to the Aspirant by Nuit Herself.And this Pentacle shall serve for a Telesmatic Image, or as an Eidolon, or as aFocus for the mind.This is the third practice of Magick Art (ccxx. I. 60).17. Let the Aspirant find a lonely place, if possible a place in the Desert ofSand, or if not, a place unfrequented, and without objects to disturb the view.Such are moorlands, fens, the open sea, broad rivers, and open fields. Also, andespecially, the summits of mountains.There let him invoke the Goddess as he hath Wisdom and Understanding so to do.But let this Invocation be that of a pure heart, i.e., a heart wholly devoted toHer, and let him remember that it is Hadit Himself in the most secret placethereof that invoketh. Then let this serpent Hadit burst into flame.This is the fourth practice of Magick Art (ccxx. I. 61).18. Then shall the Aspirant come a little to lie in her bosom.This is the third Indication of the Nature of the Result (ccxx. I. 61).19. Let the Aspirant stand upon the edge of a precipice in act or inimagination.

V. V. V. V.)20. Thus having understood the nature of this Third Indication, let him in hisMagick Rite fall from himself into Nuit, or expand into Her, as his imaginationmay compel him.And at that moment, desiring earnestly the Kiss of Nuit, let him give oneparticle of dust, i.e., let Hadit give himself up utterly to Her.This is the fifth practice of Magick Art (ccxx. I. 61).21. Then shall he lose all in that hour.This is the fourth Indication of the Nature of the Result (ccxx. I. 61).22.

I. 26).2. Let him further identify himself with the heart of Nuit, whose ecstasy is inthat of her children, and her joy to see their joy, who sayeth: I love you! Iyearn to you. Pale or purple, veiled or voluptuous, I who am all pleasure andpurple, and drunkenness of the innermost sense, desire you. Put on the wings,and arouse the coiled splendour within you. Come unto me!…Sing the rapturouslove-song unto me! Burn to me perfumes! Wear to me jewels! Drink to me, for Ilove you! I love you! I am the blue-lidded daughter of Sunset; I am the nakedbrilliance of the voluptuous night-sky. To me! To me!This is the second practice of Meditation (ccxx. I. 13, 61, 63, 64, 65).3.

Thoth is both the Magus of Taro (see Liber 418) and theUniversal Mercury; Harpocrates both the destroyer of Typhon and the Babe on theLotus. Note that the “Ibis position” formulates this conception mostexactly.—Ed.]This is the fourth practice of Intelligence (ccxx. II. 7).7.

II. 49).19. The Aspirant seated in his Asana will suddenly commence to breathestrangely, and this without the Operation of his will; the Inspiration will beassociated with the thought of intense excitement and pleasure, even toexhaustion; and the Expiration very rapid and forceful, as if this excitementwere suddenly released.This is the first and last Indication of the Sign of the Beginning of thisResult (ccxx. II. 63).20. A light will appear to the Aspirant, unexpectedly. Hadit will arise withinhim, and Nuit concentrate Herself upon him from without.

The object of them isalmost invariably the invocation of a God, that God conceived in a more or lessmaterial and personal fashion. These Rituals are therefore well suited for suchpersons as are capable of understanding the spirit of Magick as opposed to theletter.—MAGICK IN THEORY AND PRACTICEThe rituals of Thelema we've discussed so far are designed primarily for theindividual magician operating alone for the benefit of his or her own spiritualedification. They are technical and require a thorough grounding in magicaltheory. The magician strives to execute them with great art and scientificprecision. At the conclusion of the ceremony he or she dispassionately examinesthe results and duly records them in a journal. It is lonely work, because, intruth, the only material the magician has to work with is the magician—the onlyreal changes we can effect with our magical labors are changes in ourselves. Buteven though the spiritual effects of Magick are profoundly personal, Magickitself need not be a solitary exercise.Drama is also Magick—in fact, it is the oldest form of Magick. We see elementsof prehistoric dramatic ritual painted on the walls of caves and scratched uponthe bones of extinct animals. The tragedies and comedies of the ancient Greekswere written to be entertaining and thought provoking but first and foremostthey were religious observances (celebrated in the temple of Dionysus). We maynot think of them as such, but the stage, the screen, even the television aremagical temples. As we watch and listen, we become living Triangles ofEvocation. Laughter, tears, and terror are literally evoked into us by theMagick of the play or film.The magical potential of drama was not lost on our ancestors. Knowing that onlya relatively few individuals of every generation are emotionally andintellectually equipped to master the natural and spiritual sciences, thehierophants of the past discovered that it was yet possible to bring asignificant level of enlightenment to the masses. It was very important, forinstance, for the working population of ancient agrarian cultures to know thebest times to plant and cultivate their crops. However, for most of the laborforce it really wasn't important (or even helpful) to understand the chain ofastronomical events that effect the change of seasons.It was far easier (and on one level more truthful) to personify the forces andfacts of nature as gods, and then make those gods characters in a simple andunforgettable story or play. In the case of an agricultural drama the storymight simply be intended to reveal the lesson that it is best to plant in theearly spring rather than in the autumn.A greater spiritual potential of dramatic ritual lies in the fact that asindividuals each of us can actually become the main character in the sacreddrama. This is the method of initiation practiced by mystery schools of the pastand initiatory societies of today. The ancient mystery schools were not so muchschools of instruction, rather they were schools of experiences—dramaticexperiences skillfully designed to induce profound changes in consciousness to alarge number of individuals.Tradition informs us that the technique of the mystery schools achieved itshighest level of perfection in Greece. From ca. 2000 B.C. to nearly threehundred years into the Christian era the agricultural mysteries of Demeter andPersephone were celebrated within the walled citadel at Eleusis. So strict werethe oaths of secrecy imposed upon initiates that we are still not entirelycertain what went on at the ceremonies1 [part0023.html#chap11-fn1] themselves.We know from indirect sources that one the initiatory cycles began with apurifying bath in the sea at Athens followed by a ceremonial march from Athensto Eleusis. The secret activities took place over a span of days and includedsacred food and drink, music, dance, plays, and vignettes.Most of the events were performed before a large assembly of participants. Theclimactic conclusion, however, was conferred privately, one candidate at a time.Modern scholars point to evidence that prior to this sublime moment thecandidate most probably was given a psychedelic substance to eat or drink.Whatever their technique, the hierophants of Eleusis succeeded for over twothousand years in effecting profound changes in the consciousness of countlessthousands of individuals—individuals who after their initiatory experienceproclaimed with the greatest conviction that they would never fear death again.The Rite of ArtemisCome now, what masques, what dances shall we have,To wear away this long age of three hoursBetween our after-supper and bedtime?—THESEUS—A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAMOne might think that the awe-inspiring ceremonies that took place in thecavernous Temple of Demeter at Eleusis would have little in common with thegenteel after-dinner parlor diversions of Edwardian London, but that isprecisely the venue where the idea for Crowley's Rites of Eleusis was conceived.On a chilly evening in the spring of 1910 E.V., to entertain their host (orperhaps merely to sing for their supper), Crowley and his lover/disciple MissLeila Waddell engaged in curious battle that pitted poetry against music. First,Crowley recited a poem he felt would put everyone in an exalted frame of mind.Then he challenged Waddell, a consummate violin virtuoso, to complement andmagnify the mood with a piece of music.The exchanges soon became wildly intense and rapturous. After only a few volleyseveryone in the room found themselves raised to a tangible level of ecstasy.Before the bliss of the moment subsided Crowley realized he had discovered thebasic formula of the Eleusinian technique. Moreover, he now had a vehicle tointroduce Scientific Illumination and the Magick of Thelema to a wider audience.He immediately set to work to create an ecstasy-inducing dramatic ritual that hewould stage publicly.The Rite of Artemis2 [part0023.html#chap11-fn2] was presented for the public andmembers of the press on the evening of August 23, 1910 E.V. at the office of TheEquinox in London. The element of dance was added to the combination of poetryand music in the person of Victor Neuburg who, aside from being one of thegreatest poets of his generation, possessed the thrilling ability to dance withbacchanalic abandon until he collapsed unconscious upon the floor. It was veryimpressive.Another addition to the artistic mix was the introduction of the Cup of Libationthat was offered to the audience several times during the ceremony to betterfacilitate the rush of ecstasy. The content of the cup was most likely a potentmixture of herbs, alcohol, fruit juice, and mescal buttons (at the timeperfectly legal). Predictably, everyone felt the ecstasy.Reaction was remarkably positive. The next day Raymond Radclyffe wrote in theAugust 24 issue of The Sketch magazine:…beautifully conceived and beautifully carried out. If there is any higher formof artistic expression than great verse and great music, I have yet to learn it.I do not pretend to understand the ritual that runs like a thread of magicthrough these meetings of the A images [../images/00030.jpeg] A images[../images/00030.jpeg] I do not even know what the A images[../images/00030.jpeg] A images [../images/00030.jpeg] is. But I do know thatthe whole ceremony was impressive, artistic, and produced in those present sucha feeling as Crowley must have had when he wrote:“So shalt thou conquer Space, and lastly climbThe walls of Time;And by the golden path the great have trodReach up to God!”No one was more ecstatic than Crowley. He was on the road to becoming a magicalimpresario.Crowley's Rites of EleusisIn October and November of 1910 E.V. Crowley, with the assistance of Waddell,Nueburg, and a handful of disciples, publicly presented a series of dramaticrituals entitled The Rites Of Eleusis. They were performed on seven consecutiveWednesday nights at Caxton Hall, Westminster. London had never seen anythingquite like it before. The title notwithstanding, these rituals were not attemptsto reenact the ancient ceremonies of the Eleusinian mysteries. In fact, the onlything Crowley's Rites of Eleusis had in common with their namesake was thesimple fact that they (like the original ceremonies) were written and performedin order to evoke a specific variety of ecstasy in the participants and theaudience.Ambitiously, Crowley chose for his format the seven planets of the ancients, andhe arranged the seven ceremonies according to how the planetary spheres(Sephiroth) appear on the Tree of Life. Starting at the top, the third Sephirah,Binah, is sphere of Saturn and the highest planetary sphere. As we descend theTree the order of the planetary spheres are Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sol, Venus,Mercury, and Luna. This is the sequence of the seven Rites of Eleusis. They areactually seven acts to one master drama, the story of the descent of spirit(deity) into matter (humanity), and the secret to our return to Godhead.Because the rites demonstrate a descent down the Tree of Life, each ceremony isnot so much the story of the planetary god's exaltation but rather it is thestory of its decline and fall. (Luna, the final rite, also hints at how it allstarts over again.) The Rite of Saturn gets the ball rolling by the suicide ofthe Saturnian hero at the end of the play. The next rite, Jupiter, starts outwith the declaration:Be silent and secret! For it is by stealth that we are here assembled. Know thatSaturn hath been deceived, having swallowed a black stone, thinking it to be hisson, the child Jupiter. But Jupiter is here enthroned, and shall overthrow hisfather. Beware then lest ye break silence—until Jupiter be read to make war!The war, of course, will need the energy of Mars, the next rite in sequence, andso on.The following analysis was written by Crowley and was part of the bookletprovided to the attendees of the rites.Let us add a short analysis of the present series of rites; they may be taken asillustrating Humanity, its fate both good and evil.Man, unable to solve the Riddle of Existence, takes counsel of Saturn, extremeold age. Such answer as he can get is one word. “Despair.”Is there more hope in the dignity and wisdom of Jupiter? No; for the noblesenior lacks the vigour of Mars the warrior. Counsel is in vain withoutdetermination to carry it out.Mars, invoked, is indeed capable of victory: but he has already lost thecontrolled wisdom of age; in the moment of conquest he wastes the fruits of it,in the arms of luxury.It is through this weakness that the perfected man, the Sun, is of dual nature,and his evil twin slays him in his glory. So the triumphant Lord of Heaven, thebeloved of Apollo and the Muses is brought down into the dust, and who shallmourn him but his Mother Nature, Venus, the lady of love and sorrow? Well is itif she bears within her the Secret of Resurrection!But Mercury, too, is found wanting. Not in him alone is the secret cure for allthe woe of the human race. Swift as ever, he passes, and gives place to theyoungest of the Gods, to the Virginal Moon.Behold her, Madonna-like, throned and crowned, veiled, silent awaiting thepromise of the Future.She is Isis and Mary, Istar and Bhavani, Artemis and Diana.But Artemis is still barren of hope until the spirit of the Infinite All, greatPan, tears asunder the veil and displays the hope of humanity, the Crowned Childof the Future. All this is symbolized in the holy rites which we have recoveredfrom the darkness of history, and now in the fullness of time disclose that theworld may be redeemed.3 [part0023.html#chap11-fn3]In the late 1970s, under the sponsorship of several local O.T.O.4[part0023.html#chap11-fn4] bodies in Northern and Southern California, the Ritesof Eleusis were resurrected and again presented. They were an instant hit.Today, largely through the efforts of O.T.O. bodies, the seven rites areperformed each year in numerous locations all over the world. They areextraordinarily “producible.” Each rite requires only a handful of cast membersand very limited props and costumes. They are as easily staged in a living roomor a back yard as they are in a theatre, hall or desert or mountain venue.If I sound enthusiastic about Crowley's Rites of Eleusis—I am. In the lasttwenty-five years Constance and I have had the pleasure of staging the entireseries a number of times and have participated in other group productions aswell. We discovered first hand that these little collections of poetry, music,and dance are more than plays with a magical theme. In the purest tradition ofthe Eleusinian mysteries, they really are initiatory experiences in which bothcast and audience are treated to a highly personalized change of consciousness.Unfortunately, space forbids us to reprint all seven of the rituals in thisbook. I have chosen the Rite of Sol because it clearly presents the majorlandmarks of casting and form that characterize all the rites.THE RITE OF SOL5 [part0023.html#chap11-fn5]Fourth in the Series of The Rites of EleusisFirst performed at Caxton Hall WestministerOn Wednesday, November 9, 1910 E.V. 9:00 P.M.by Miss Leila Waddell and Mr. Aleister Crowleywith Distinguished AssistanceNote:The Rites were written and produced by Aleister Crowley except parts of theRites of Mars and of Mercury which were written by an adept who wishes to remainanonymous.The solos were chosen from her repertoire by Miss Leila Waddell.Additional notes by Lon Milo DuQuetteOFFICERSSOL.

In all systems of religion is to be found a system of Initiation, which maybe defined as the process by which a man comes to learn that unknown Crown.3. Though none can communicate either the knowledge or the power to achievethis, which we may call the Great Work, it is yet possible for initiates toguide others.—LIBER LXI VEL CAUSAEBefore I began to organize the material for this handbook of rituals, I lookedback over 30 years to when my struggle to study the Magick of Thelema began. Itwas as if I was thrust into post graduate work without ever finishing grammarschool. I was singularly fortunate to make contact with several of Crowley'spersonal students who were kind enough to answer my questions and offerencouragement and invaluable suggestions. I learned that there is a step-by-stepapproach to the subjects, and I have endeavored to organize the material in thistext along the same linear scale. Even though this is by no means a completecompendium of the rituals of Aleister Crowley, I am hopeful that it will be avaluable tool for both beginning and advanced students.Because of my association with Crowley contemporaries, I am often asked if it isnecessary to affiliate with an organization in order to become a Thelemicmagician. This question invariably disappoints me because it reveals that thequerent is fundamentally ignorant of what it means to be a Thelemite.No! One does not have to join any organization, society, order, club,association, fraternity, collegium, lodge, chapter, temple, coven, tribe, party,league, fellowship, union, guild, team, troop, or pact to be a Thelemite orpractice Thelemic Magick.There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt. The very term, “Thelemicorganization,” seems to be an oxymoron. A collection of militant individualistsall endeavoring to do their own will—this sounds like a recipe for chaos; and inmany instances it is precisely that. Yet Crowley seemed inspired by the thoughtof a New Aeon society that could merge the precepts of complete personal libertywith the necessities of self-imposed spiritual disciplines. He experimentedalong various lines but finally settled on two “Orders” which he hoped wouldflourish in the millennia following his death: the A images[../images/00030.jpeg] A images [../images/00030.jpeg] and the O.T.O.A images [../images/00030.jpeg] A images [../images/00030.jpeg]The A images [../images/00030.jpeg] A images [../images/00030.jpeg] 1[part0023.html#chap12-fn1] was founded in 1907 by Crowley and George CecilJones. Based upon the classic Rosicrucian grade system of the Golden Dawn, the Aimages [../images/00030.jpeg] A images [../images/00030.jpeg]. requires themagician to actually achieve the states of consciousness and powers embodied ineach of the ten Sephiroth (i.e., the magician is only an Adeptus Minor when heor she has actually achieved the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy GuardianAngel).The A images [../images/00030.jpeg] A images [../images/00030.jpeg] is not alodge system, and is entirely secret. It is a testing order, not a teachingorder. The Aspirant officially knows only one person in the Order, his or hersuperior. Each magician is, for the most part, left alone to do the work as heor she sees fit. Ideally, contact with the superior is brief and infrequent, andcan be characterized as being suggestive rather than instructive. Advancement tothe next grade is simply a seal upon attainment.The superior is at least one grade ahead of the Aspirant and is theoreticallycapable of recognizing the initiatory level of his or her student. The superioris answerable to their superior, etc. After a certain level of attainment hasbeen successfully achieved and recognized, the Aspirant can then take on astudent and become part of the chain. While Crowley was alive, it was obviouswho was at the top of this chain, and though the practical did not always alignwith the ideal, one could be reasonably confident in the system. Since hisdeath, matters have become more confusing. The present situation is basicallythis:Today there remain a number of individuals who had a formal A images[../images/00030.jpeg] A images [../images/00030.jpeg] relationship with Crowleyor one of several of Crowley's students. Some of these individuals have chosento continue to take on students, who in turn have taken on students, and soforth. As the nature of these relationships is secret. There is no way, short ofaffiliation, to gauge the quality of the magical work done.There are also a number of publicly advertised A images [../images/00030.jpeg] Aimages [../images/00030.jpeg] s (and groups hinting they are the “doorway” tothe A images [../images/00030.jpeg] A images [../images/00030.jpeg]) which onemay contact simply by answering their magazine ads. As Crowley stressed theprivacy of the system, and particularly prohibited the exchange of any money (onpain of immediate expulsion) in connection with the A images[../images/00030.jpeg] A images [../images/00030.jpeg] , I tend to view suchgroups with a level of skepticism.While I have no reason to doubt the sincerity or the competence of theindividuals in either of the above categories, I must caution the reader againstputting too much emphasis upon pedigrees and paperwork. The real work is alwaysaccomplished by the Aspirant alone. More often than not the student learns inspite of the teacher's effort to help, not as the result of it.Answers will come as soon as the student is wise enough to formulate thequestions. There is no reason to wait for an Adept to appear and make the GreatWork easier for you. Anyone who is serious about A images [../images/00030.jpeg]A images [../images/00030.jpeg] affiliation can immediately begin the work byreviewing the prescribed material,2 [part0023.html#chap12-fn2] mapping out aregimen of study and practice, and setting to work. If there is any validity tothe concept of Secret Chiefs, such a display of determined sincerity will mostcertainly attract their attention and form the required inner plane contact. Abit of patience and tenacity is often required to locate a flesh and bloodcontact, but rest assured, they are out there. The reader is cautioned, however,against casually boasting of one's “A images [../images/00030.jpeg] A images[../images/00030.jpeg]” position or achievements if one is not indeed affiliatedwith the A images [../images/00030.jpeg] A images [../images/00030.jpeg] Suchpretense is likely to create a stumbling block to bona fide affiliation, and isalso just bad manners.Excerpts from One Star in Sight3 [part0023.html#chap12-fn3] follow, whichprovide a basic outline of the structure and duties of the graded system of theA images [../images/00030.jpeg] A images [../images/00030.jpeg] .The order of the S.S.Ipsissimus 10° = 1▫ Magus 9° = 2▫ Magister Templi 8° = 3▫The order of the R.C.(Babe of the Abyss—the link)Adeptus Exemptus 7° = 4▫ Adeptus Major 6° = 5▫ Adeptus Minor 5° = 6▫The Order of the G.D.(Dominus Liminis—the link)Philosophus 4°=7▫ Practicus 3° = 8▫ Zelator 2° = 9▫ Neophyte 1° = 10▫Probationer 0° = 0▫Student—His business is to acquire a general intellectual knowledge of allsystems of attainment, as declared in the prescribed books. (See curriculum.)Probationer—His principal business is to begin such practices as he may prefer,and to write a careful record of the same for one year.Neophyte—Has to acquire perfect control of the Astral Plane.Zelator—His main work is to acheive complete success in Asana and Pranayama. Healso begins to study the formula of the “Rosy Cross.”Practicus—Is expected to complete his intellectual training, and in particularto study the Qabalah.Philosophus—Is expected to complete his moral training. He is tested in Devotionto the Order.Dominus Liminis—Is expected to show mastery of Pratyahara and Dharana.Adeptus (without)—Is expected to perform the Great Work and to attain theKnowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel.Adeptus (within)—Is admitted to the practice of the formula of the Rosy Cross onentering the College of the Holy Ghost.Adeptus (Major)—Obtains a general mastery of practical Magick, though withoutcomprehension.Adeptus (Exemptus)—Completes in perfection all these matters. He then either (a)becomes a Brother of the Left Hand Path or (b) is stripped of all hisattainments and of himself as well, even of the Holy Guardian Angel, and becomesa Babe of the Abyss, who, having transcended the Reason, does nothing but growin the womb of its mother. It then finds itself a Magister Templi.Magister Templi (Master of the Temple)—Whose functions are fully described inLiber 418, as is this whole initiation from Adeptus Exemptus. See also “Aha!”.His principal business is to tend his “Garden” of disciples and to obtain aperfect understanding of the Universe. He is a Master of Samadhi.Magus—Attains to wisdom, declares his Law (see Liber I, vel Magi) and is aMaster of all Magick in its greatest and highest sense.Ipsissimus—Is beyond all this and beyond all comprehension of those lowerdegrees.images [../images/00009.jpeg]In the mid 1940s, Karl Germer, a key administrative officer of the O.T.O., wroteCrowley asking for a definitive statement regarding the difference between the Aimages [../images/00030.jpeg] A images [../images/00030.jpeg] and the O.T.O. Thefollowing is Crowley's reply.The difference between the A images [../images/00030.jpeg] A images[../images/00030.jpeg] and the O.T.O. is very clear and simple. The A images[../images/00030.jpeg] A images [../images/00030.jpeg] is a sempiternalinstitution, and entirely secret. There is no communication between its members.Theoretically, a member knows only the superior who introduced him, and anyperson whom he himself has introduced. The Order is run on purely spirituallines.The object of membership is also entirely simple. The first objective is theKnowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. The next objective,omitting considerations for the present of the VI = V, and VII = IV degrees, isthe crossing of the Abyss, and the attainment of mastership of the Temple. Thisis described very fully especially in Liber 418. Much less is written about theV = VI degree, i.e., the Knowledge and Conversation, because it is too secretand individual. It is impossible to lay down conditions, or to describe theexperiences involved in detail.The O.T.O. has nothing to do with this, except that the BOOK OF THE LAW and theWord of the Aeon are essential principles of membership. In all other respects,it stands by itself as a body similar to Freemasonry, but involving acceptanceof a social and economic system which is intended to put the world on its feet.There is also, of course, the secret of the IX° which is, so to say, the weaponwhich they may use to further these purposes.—666, SEPTEMBER 16, 1946O.T.O.In contrast to the images [../images/00030.jpeg] A images[../images/00030.jpeg], the O.T.O. (Ordo Templi Orientis) operates publicly andsemipublicly in a manner not dissimilar to modern Freemasonry. In fact, itsfounding father, Karl Kellner was a high-grade Austrian Mason, who patterned thebasic degree structure of the Order after the Blue Lodge, Royal Arch, CouncilPrince of Jerusalem, Rose-Croix and Kadosch degrees of continental Freemasonry.Kellner traveled widely and was fascinated with the magical practices of theEast and Near East. Reportedly, during one of his Burtonesque pilgrimages, hemet three Adepts who progressively revealed to him a series of powerful magicaltechniques of a sexual nature. When he digested the full implications of thisinformation, Kellner saw that this “Secret of Secrets” was the key whichunlocked the mysteries of both Freemasonry and Christian Mysticism. He wasted notime in incorporating this revelation in the higher degrees of his local lodge.In 1902 the existence of the O.T.O. was revealed in Oriflamme, a German Masonicpublication, and it was announced that the Order taught the “secret of sexualmagic.”Crowley was given leadership of the O.T.O. in the English-speaking world in 1912and reworked the Degree Rituals to conform with the Liber AL and the Law ofThelema. An excellent history of the Order is outlined in The Equinox Vol. III.,Number 104 [part0023.html#chap12-fn4] and I encourage anyone interested in theO.T.O. to review it.O.T.O. membership does not, of itself, confer any status in Freemasonry. Inrecent years this has led to confusion among the less-informed brethren of bothinstitutions. The following is an official statement from the O.T.O.'s websitewhich should clear up any misunderstandings.Nearly one hundred years ago, when O.T.O. was established in Germany, it wasclosely allied to several rites of European Freemasonry. However, in October of1918, owing to the unique religious teachings of O.T.O., Aleister Crowleydetermined it appropriate for O.T.O. to sever all Masonic ties and formallyrenounce any claim to “make Masons.” At that time, while retaining the use ofcertain convenient customs and terminology used in early Freemasonry, Crowleyrevised the O.T.O. rituals, insignia and modes of recognition to avoidinfringing upon the legitimate privileges of the established and recognizedauthorities of modern Freemasonry. Further revisions along similar lines havebeen implemented in more recent years.Despite some similarities between names and titles used within O.T.O. and thenames and titles used in Masonry, various churches, and other organizations,conferral of any degree, rank, office, or status within O.T.O. does notconstitute conferral of any degree, rank, office, or status in any other activeorganization—Masonic, religious, or otherwise, any more than the rank of“sergeant” in the Salvation Army equates to rank of sergeant in the U.S. MarineCorps.Ordo Templi Orientis is more active today than it ever was during Crowley'slifetime. It has official bodies in seventeen countries and provides DegreeInitiations, Gnostic Masses, and an assortment of public and semipublic eventsincluding Crowley's Rites of Eleusis. The O.T.O. is without question the mostvisible Thelemic organization on earth.There is no doubt that the series of dramatic rituals which comprise the O.T.O.Initiatory Degrees can have a lasting and profound magical effect upon thecandidate. It is also true that fellowship with other Thelemites can be arewarding and satisfying experience. But, as we mentioned above in our commentsabout the A images [../images/00030.jpeg] A images [../images/00030.jpeg], thereal work is done by the individual. No one can reveal to you a real secret. Noone can project enlightenment upon you. If you expect affiliation with anyorganization is going to lighten your magical work load, you are mistaken; andif you are waiting for a teacher who embodies perfection, or a group in whichthere are no jerks, you will wait forever.Below is a portion of one of Crowley's letter which first appeared in MagickWithout Tears (Hampton, NJ: Thelema, 1954) which briefly outlines the system ofthe O.T.O.…What is a Dramatic Ritual? It is a celebration of the Adventure of the God whomit is intended to invoke. (The Bacchae of Euripides is a perfect example ofthis.) Now, in the O.T.O., the object of the ceremony being the Initiation ofthe Candidate, it is he whose Path in Eternity is displayed in dramatic form.What is the Path? 1. The Ego is attracted to the Solar System. 2. The Child experiences Birth. 3. The Man experiences Life. 4. He experiences Death. 5. He experiences the World beyond Death. 6. This entire cycle of Point-Events is withdrawn into Annihilation.In the O.T.O. these successive stages are represented as follows: 1. 0° (Minerval) 2. I° (Initiation) 3. II° (Consecration) 4. III° (Devotion) 5. IV° (Perfection, or Exaltation) 6. P.I. (Perfect Initiate)Of these Events or Stations upon the Path all but three (II°) are singlecritical experiences. We, however, are concerned mostly with the very variedexperiences of Life.All subsequent Degrees of the O.T.O. are accordingly elaboration of the II°,since in a single ceremony it is hardly possible to sketch, even in the briefestoutline, the Teaching of Initiates with regard to Life. The Rituals V°-IX° arethen instructions to the Candidate how he should conduct himself; and theyconfer upon him, gradually the Magical Secrets which make him Master of Life.images [../images/00009.jpeg]While Ordo Templi Orientis is a magical and fraternal organization, within theOrder's matrix can be found a jewel which offers all aspirants a unique andbeautiful medium for Thelemic religious expression. It is the central ritual ofthe O.T.O., public and private—The Mass of Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THIRTEENimages [../images/00006.jpeg]THE RELIGION OF THELEMAOne of the simplest and most complete Magick ceremonies is the Eucharist. Itconsists in taking common things, transmuting them into things divine, andconsuming them.—Magick in Theory and PracticeIt is no accident that I have chosen to make Liber XV the final chapter of thisHandbook of the Rituals of Thelema. Anyone who has had the privilege ofcelebrating the Gnostic Mass will understand that I have saved the best forlast. This eucharistic ceremony exquisitely expresses the purest element ofThelemic cosmology and philosophy; and it does so in such a manner that it canbe appreciated by the broadest possible spectrum of truth seekers.The “Law is for all,” and as fascinating as the study of Thelemic Magick may befor many of us, the fact remains that the vast majority of the population willnever be attracted to the theories and techniques I've outlined in this book.Nor should their disinterest in the technical aspects of Magick exclude themfrom embracing the Law of Thelema or applying the formulae of the New Aeon totheir lives.Like the Roman or Orthodox Mass of the Aeon of Osiris, Liber XV serves to bringthe Thelemic community together to affirm a common creed, and provides anopportunity for all to participate directly in the magical formulae of the Age.However, in order for all to participate directly in the magical formulae ofMass, the Mass must be conducted in such a manner as to actually communicatethose formulae. Unfortunately, it takes only a slight change of focus on thepart of the ritual team or congregation to degenerate the Mass from a ceremonyof the religion of the future to a ritual that exalts the spiritual formulae ofthe past.The Gnostic Mass temple is a very beautiful and highly symbolic ritual space. Inthe East (direction of Boleskine) there is a shrine or High Altar. This shrinesupports the Stélé of Revealing, The Book of the Law, and the Sacred Elements ofthe Eucharist. The High Altar is the focal point of the worship service. This iswhere the Magick takes place in the Aeon of the Crowned and Conquering Child.Everything that is said and done in the other areas of the temple are merelypreparatory acts to the Magick that will take place upon the High Altar.The High Altar is elevated above the rest of the temple. It is set upon the toplevel of a dais of three steps. This is the High Place of the temple and anappropriate setting for the eventual magical climax of the ceremony.Once the Priestess has taken her place upon the High Altar and the veil is drawnbefore the shrine, the Priest ascends to the High Altar by the three steps ofthe dais. As he does so, he halts at each step and he, the Priestess, and theDeacon poetically reveal a fundamental mystery of this worship service—thatis—the formula of worship in the Aeon of Horus has evolved, step by step, fromthe formulae of the two previous Aeons.1 [part0023.html#chap13-fn1]The First Step represents the Aeon of Isis, the Age of the Goddess, and it is onthe first step that the Goddess is worshipped in the Gnostic Mass. Here thePriestess is identified as the Goddess Nuit. It is on the first step that thePriest sings: “O Nuit, continuous one of Heaven let it be ever thus that menspeak not of thee as one but as none, and let them speak not of thee at allsince thou art continuous.” And it is while standing on the first step that hehears the Priestess deliver her beautiful “but to love me is better than allthings” speech.As worshipers, we could stay on the first step worshiping the Goddess andadhering to her formula forever. Indeed, many people do just that. But we, theChildren of the Aeon of Horus, adore the Goddess not as an end but as a means.We linger on the first step only long enough to activate the formula of theGoddess within ourselves to prepare for a wedding—only long enough to allowourselves to be aroused by the essence of her divinity before stepping up to thenext level of worship.The Second Step represents the Aeon of Osiris, the Age of the Dying God, and itis on the second step that the Priest is identified as the God Hadit, theinscrutable lover at the very center of the infinite body of Nuit. “I am theflame that burns in every heart of man and the core of every star.” And,reminiscent of Osiris, Krishna, Chirst, and every other dying God, he goes on tosay, “I am life and the giver of life yet therefore is the knowledge of me theknowledge of death.”As worshipers, we could stay on the second step worshiping the Dying God andadhering to his formula forever. Indeed, many people do just that. But we, theChildren of the Aeon of Horus, adore the Dying God not as an end but as a means.We linger on the second step only long enough to activate the formula of theDying God within ourselves; only long enough to snatch the vibrating pulse oflife and death from the patriarchal Lord in order to prepare for a wedding—awedding that we will celebrate on the third and final step.It is upon the Third Step that we achieve synthesis. It is upon the third stepthe mystic marriage will be consummated. It is upon the third step the trueobject of worship will appear—Ra-Hoor-Khuit, the Crowned and Conquering Child,the Child of the Goddess and God of the last two Aeons.We give thanks and respect to the Goddess and the Priestess who embodies her.But at the end of the Mass it is not she whom we worship; it is not she whom weadore; it is not she with whom we commune.We give thanks and respect to the God and the Priest who embodies him. But atthe end of the Mass it is not he whom we worship; it is not he whom we adore. Itis not he with whom we commune.As we will soon see, the Mass of the Gnostic Catholic Church is an enactment ofa great and wonderful magical secret. The goal of this secret is the creation ofa Child, whether that child is the material or emotional object of your heart'sdesire, or knowledge and conversation of your Holy Guardian Angel.It is true, without the Goddess and the God the Child could not be born. Butthose who would treat the Gnostic Mass as a ceremony of Goddess worship aremissing the point entirely. With all the other worshipers of the Aeon of Isis,they cannot rise above the first step of worshipThose who would relegate the Gnostic Mass to a ceremony of phallus worship arealso missing the point entirely. Like worshipers of the Aeon of Osiris theycannot rise above the second step of worship.At the end of the ceremony each celebrant should be standing spiritually on thethird step of worship—our attention focused with full concentration not upon thePriestess, not upon the Priest, but upon the Child, as embodied in the Host andWine. Only those who have achieved, then transcended the arousal of the Goddess;only those who have achieved, then transcended the concentrated potency of theGod; only those who have annihilated both God and Goddess in ecstasy can standon the third spiritual step and consume—then become the child of their union.Only those who have taken the third spiritual step are worthy to be calledWorshipers of the Aeon of Horus.Today, largely due the tremendous growth of the O.T.O., the Gnostic Mass isregularly celebrated worldwide. It is used to observe the feast days of The Bookof the Law, and to mark the Thelemic community's births, rites of passage,marriages, and deaths. For the initiate, Liber XV is a treasure house oftechnical information relating to a supreme technique of High Magick; but forall of us, it is a joyous feast, an act of worship, and the celebration of amiracle.

Its dimensions should be 7 feet in length, 3 feet inbreadth, 44 inches in height.3 [part0023.html#chap13-fn3] It should be coveredwith a crimson altar-cloth, on which may be embroidered fleur-de-lys in gold, ora sun-blaze, or other suitable emblem.On each side of it should be a pillar or obelisk, with countercharges in blackand white.Below it should be the dais of three steps, in black and white squares.Above it is the super-altar, at whose top is the Stélé of Revealing inreproduction, with four candles on each side of it. Below the Stélé is a placefor The Book of the Law, with six candles on each side of it. Below this againis the Holy Graal, with roses on each side of it. There is room in front of theCup for the Paten. On each side beyond the roses are two great candles.All this is enclosed within a great Veil.Forming the apex of an equilateral triangle whose base is a line drawn betweenthe pillars, is a small black square altar, of superimposed cubes.Taking this altar as the middle of the base of a similar and equal triangle, atthe apex of this second triangle is a small circular font.Repeating, the apex of a third triangle is an upright tomb.IIOF THE OFFICERS OF THE MASSThe PRIEST: Bears the Sacred Lance, and is clothed at first in a plain whiterobe.The PRIESTESS: Should be actually Virgo Intacta or specially dedicated to theservice of the Great Order.

(There should be a doorkeeper toattend to the admission.) The DEACON advances and bows before the open shrinewhere the Graal is exalted. He kisses The Book of the Law, three times, opensit, and places it upon the superaltar. He turns West.The DEACON: Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. I proclaim the Lawof Light, Life, Love, and Liberty in the name of IAΩ.The CONGREGATION: Love is the law, love under will.The DEACON goes to his place between the altar of incense and the font, facesEast, and gives the step and sign of a Man and a Brother.

They await her below. She places the Patenbefore the Graal. Having adored it, she descends, and with the childrenfollowing her, the positive next her, she moves in a serpentine manner involving3 1/2 circles of the Temple. (Deosil about altar, widdershins about font, deosilabout altar and font, widdershins about altar, and so to the Tomb in the West.)She draws her Sword and pulls down the Veil therewith.The PRIESTESS: By the power of images [../images/00063.jpeg] Iron, I say untothee, Arise.

Penitential music.The PRIEST: I am a man among men.He takes again the Lance, and lowers it.

(The crown may be of gold orplatinum, or of electrum magicum; but with no other metals save the smallproportions necessary to a proper alloy. It may be adorned with divers jewels,at will. But it must have the Uraeus serpent twined about it, and the cap ofmaintenance must match the scarlet of the Robe. Its texture should be velvet.)Be the Serpent thy crown, O thou PRIEST of the LORD!Kneeling, she takes the Lance, between her open hands, and runs them up and downupon the shaft eleven times, very gently.Be the LORD present among us!ALL give the Hailing Sign.The PEOPLE: So mote it be.IVOF THE CEREMONY OF THE OPENING OF THE VEILThe PRIEST: Thee therefore whom we adore we also invoke.By the power of the lifted Lance!He raises the Lance. ALL repeat Hailing Sign. A phrase of triumphant music. ThePRIEST takes the PRIESTESS by her right hand with his left, keeping the Lanceraised.I, PRIEST and KING, take thee Virgin pure without spot; I upraise thee; I leadthee to the East; I set thee upon the summit of the Earth.He thrones the PRIESTESS upon the altar. The DEACON and the children follow,they in rank, behind him. The PRIESTESS takes The Book of the Law, resumes herseat, and holds it open on her breast with her two hands, making a descendingtriangle with thumbs and forefingers. The PRIEST gives the lance to the DEACONto hold, and takes the ewer from the child, and sprinkles the PRIESTESS, makingfive crosses, forehead, shoulders, and thighs. The thumb of the PRIEST is alwaysbetween his index and medius, whenever he is not holding the Lance. The PRIESTtakes the censer from the child, and makes five crosses, as before. The childrenreplace their weapons on their respective altars. The PRIEST kisses The Book ofthe Law three times. He kneels for a space in adoration, with joined hands,knuckles closed, thumb in position aforesaid. He rises, and draws the veil overthe whole altar. All rise and stand to order. The PRIEST takes the lance fromthe DEACON, and holds it as before, as Osiris or Pthah. He circumambulates theTemple three times, followed by the DEACON and the children as before. (These,when not using their hands, keep their arms crossed upon their breasts.) At thelast circumambulation they leave him, and go to the place between the font andthe small altar, where they kneel in adoration, their hands joined palm to palm,and raised above their heads. All imitate this motion. The PRIEST returns to theEast, and mounts the first step of the altar.The PRIEST: O circle of Stars whereof our Father is but the younger brother,marvel beyond imagination, soul of infinite space, before whom Time is Ashamed,the mind bewildered, and the understanding dark, not unto Thee may we attain,unless Thine image be Love. Therefore by seed and root and stem and bud and leafand flower and fruit do we invoke Thee.Then the priest answered & said unto the Queen of Space, kissing her lovelybrows, and the dew of her light bathing his whole body in a sweet-smellingperfume of sweat: O Nuit, continuous one of Heaven, let it be ever thus; thatmen speak not of Thee as One but as None; and let them speak not of thee at all,since thou art continuous!During this speech the PRIESTESS must have divested herself completely of herrobe. See CCXX I: 62.The PRIESTESS: But to love me is better than all things: if under thenight-stars in the desert thou presently burnest mine incense before me,invoking me with a pure heart, and the Serpent flame therein, thou shalt come alittle to lie in my bosom. For one kiss wilt thou then be willing to give all;but whoso gives one particle of dust shall lose all in that hour. Ye shallgather goods and store of women and spices; ye shall wear rich jewels; ye shallexceed the nations of the earth in splendour and pride; but always in the loveof me, and so shall ye come to my joy. I charge you earnestly to come before mein a single robe, and covered with a rich head-dress. I love you! I yearn toyou! Pale or purple, veiled or voluptuous, I who am all pleasure and purple, anddrunkenness of the innermost sense, desire you. Put on the wings, and arouse thecoiled splendour within you: come unto me! To me! To Me! Sing the rapturouslove-song unto me! Burn to me perfumes! Wear to me jewels! Drink to me, for Ilove you! I love you. I am the blue-lidded daughter of Sunset; I am the nakedbrilliance of the voluptuous night-sky. To me! To me!The PRIEST mounts the second step.The PRIEST: O secret of secrets that art hidden in the being of all that lives,not Thee do we adore, for that which adoreth is also Thou. Thou art That, andThat am I.I am the flame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core of every star.I am Life, and the giver of Life; yet therefore is the knowledge of me theknowledge of death. I am alone; there is no God where I am.The DEACON and all rise to their feet, with the Hailing sign.The DEACON: But ye, O my people rise up and awake. Let the rituals be rightlyperformed with joy and beauty.There are rituals of the elements and feasts of the times.A feast for the first night of the Prophet and his Bride.A feast for the three days of the writing of the Book of the Law.A feast for Tahuti and the child of the Prophet—secret O Prophet!A feast for the Supreme Ritual, and a feast for the Equinox of the Gods.A feast for fire and a feast for water; a feast for life and a greater feast fordeath.A feast every day in your hearts in the joy of my rapture.A feast every night unto Nu, and the pleasure of uttermost delight.The PRIEST mounts the third step.The PRIEST: Thou that art One, our Lord in the Universe the Sun, our Lord inourselves whose name is Mystery of Mystery, uttermost being whose radianceenlightening the worlds is also the breath that maketh every God even and Deathto tremble before Thee—By the Sign of Light images [../images/00063.jpeg] appearThou glorious upon the throne of the Sun.Make open the path of creation and of intelligence between us and our minds.Enlighten our understanding.Encourage our hearts.

This text is unique among such writings,however, in that it forbids anyone to interpret its meaning for anyone else,thereby avoiding the pitfalls of doctrine, priestcraft and dogma.Chapter Two1 [part0011.html#chap2-fnt1] The Great Astrological Year lasts approximately26,000 years and is divided into twelve periods of approximately 2,166 yearscorresponding to each of the twelve signs of the zodiac. Because the Sun doesnot quite make it back to its starting point each year, it appears to slowlyregress backwards through the zodiac at the rate of one sign every 2,166 years.This is why the Age of Aquarius follows that of Pisces, which followed Aries,etc.2 [part0011.html#chap2-fnt2] Magical and Philosophical Commentaries on THEBOOK OF THE LAW (Montreal: 93 Publishing 1974), p. 271.3 [part0011.html#chap2-fnt3] Spelled “Nuit” in Liber AL vel Legis, chapter I,verse 1.4 [part0011.html#chap2-fnt4] Later identified with the Greek goddess Demeter.5 [part0011.html#chap2-fnt5] Set, later identified with Apophis and the Greekdevil-god Typhon.6 [part0011.html#chap2-fnt6] The sacred phallus, which Seth threw in theNile, and was eaten by three fishes was never recovered.7 [part0011.html#chap2-fnt7] This date, coincidentally, also marked thebeginning of the astrological Age of Aries.8 [part0011.html#chap2-fnt8] Although the systematic destruction of therainforests is bringing an end to these time capsules of prehistory.Chapter Three1 [part0012.html#chap3-fnt1] The Equinox of the Gods (New York: 93Publishing, 1992).2 [part0012.html#chap3-fnt2] The Equinox I (1–10) (London, 1909; reprintedYork Beach, ME: Samuel Weiser, 1992).3 [part0012.html#chap3-fnt3] Rose Kelly, the sister of his friend GeraldKelly.4 [part0012.html#chap3-fnt4] The Equinox of the Gods, (New York: 93Publishing, 1992).5 [part0012.html#chap3-fnt5] The Photographs of the front and back of theStélé Revealing, along with Crowley's paraphrase were taken from Volume I,Number VII of The Equinox (York Beach, ME: Samuel Weiser, 1990) p. 368.6 [part0012.html#chap3-fnt6] Horus in his aspect as the innocent babe; oftendepicted fearlessly standing upon two crocodiles, holding his finger or thumb tohis lips.7 [part0012.html#chap3-fnt7] For reasons that are not altogether clear,Crowley, after writing the Syllabus, created a fifth classification, Class E.8 [part0012.html#chap3-fnt8] See “A Syllabus of the official instructions ofA images [../images/00030.jpeg] A images [../images/00030.jpeg],” The Equinox,Vol. No. 10.Chapter Four1 [part0013.html#chap4-fnt1] Aleister Crowley, The Equinox, Vol. I, No. 1(London: 1909; reprinted: York Beach, ME: Samuel Weiser, 1992), p. 17.2 [part0013.html#chap4-fnt2] Atziluth, the archetypal world of pure Deity;Briah, the creative-archangelic world; Yetzirah the formative-angelic world; andAssiah, the elemental world of substance.3 [part0013.html#chap4-fnt3] In many tarot decks The Magician card is calledThe Juggler.4 [part0013.html#chap4-fnt4] 25 being the square of 5.5 [part0013.html#chap4-fnt5] See The Works of Aleister Crowley, The Temple ofthe Holy Ghost, Vol. I (Homewood, IL: Yoga Publishing, 1978), p. 204.6 [part0013.html#chap4-fnt6] Crowley's Liber O, part IV, in Magick in Theoryand Practice (New York: Magickal Childe, 1990), p. 379.7 [part0013.html#chap4-fnt7] 1–5 is referred to as the Qabalistic Cross. Themagician actually indicates the three pillars of the Tree of Life upon his orher body. This affirms the magician's identity as a microcosmic representationof God and announces that fact to the world.—Ed.8 [part0013.html#chap4-fnt8] 6–14 the Divine Names are taken from traditionalqabalistic sources; IHVH, the Tetragrammaton; ADNI, often translated “Lord,”used as a synonym for the Holy Guardian Angel; AHIH, “I Am.” AGLA is a notariqonof “Ateh Gibor Le-Olahm Adonai” (Thou art mighty forever my Lord). These namesgovern their respective Archangels; Raphael (God has healed); Gabriel (God is mystrength); Michael (who is as God); and Auriel (light of God). These Archangels,in turn, rule a host of Angels and lesser spiritual entities of theElements.—Ed.9 [part0013.html#chap4-fnt9] The Hexagram.”It flames both above and beneaththe magus, who is thus in a cube of 4 pentagrams and 2 hexagrams, 32 points inall.” —Crowley, The Palace of the World.By creating the four pentagrams at the quarters and positioning the fourarchangels to stand as guardians, the magician has sealed the circle, andcreated a new magical environment. The microcosm (the “little” world of Five) isnow held at bay outside and beyond. A vacuum is formed within the circle (whichhas become a column extending infinitely above and below). As Magick and Natureabhor vacuums, this environment is immediately filled by the inrush of themacrocosm (the “big” world of Six, represented by the hexagram). It is from thissuperior position the magician sets to work.—Ed.10 [part0013.html#chap4-fnt10] This injunction does not apply to gods likePhthah or Harpocrates whose natures do not accord with this gesture.11 [part0013.html#chap4-fnt11] This gesture is the “Sign of Horus” or the “Signof the Enterer.” —Ed.12 [part0013.html#chap4-fnt12] Or the thumb, the fingers being closed. Thethumb symbolizes spirit, the forefinger the element of water. (Editor's note:the “Sign of Harpocrates” also called the “Sign of Silence.”)13 [part0013.html#chap4-fnt13] With the Greater Pentagram Ritual, it ispossible to Invoke or Banish any of the five elements by the correct use of theappropriate pentagrams.14 [part0013.html#chap4-fnt14] These are the traditional microcosmicattributions determined by the terrestrial winds.15 [part0013.html#chap4-fnt15] Liber O, Part IV.16 [part0013.html#chap4-fnt16] The Signs of the Portal: Extend the hands infront of you, palms outward, separate them as if in the act of rending asunder aveil or curtain (actives), and then bring them together as if closing it upagain and let them fall to the side (passives).17 [part0013.html#chap4-fnt17] Divine Name representing the forces of creation(Genesis I, 1). Often mistranslated as the singular, “God,” (i.e. “In thebeginning God created…” it is more accurately rendered “gods, male and female”for in Hebrew it is a feminine noun (ELOH) ending with a masculine plural (IM).Elohim thus is descriptive of female potency mated with a masculine idea.Without such a union offspring, and consequently creation, would be impossible.18 [part0013.html#chap4-fnt18] Divine Name representing the fourth Sephirah,Chesed, in the highest of the four Qabalistic worlds, Atziluth; often translatedGod the Creator; root of Eloah, Elohim, Allah, etc.Chapter Five1 [part0014.html#chap5-fnt1] My original plan for the format of this book wasto introduce the hexagram rituals at this point for the benefit the novice.

My apologies to beginning students who maywish to now turn to Part I of Chapter Six and briefly acquaint themselves withthe traditional hexagram rituals before continuing on.2 [part0014.html#chap5-fnt2] The 30 Aethyrs roughly correspond, in groups of3, to the 10 Sephiroth, of the Tree of Life.

Theyare the apparatus of communication between the planes; as such, they areconventions. There is no absolute validity in any means of mental apprehension;but unless we make these spirits of the Firmament subject unto us byestablishing right relation (within the possible limits) with the Universe, weshall fall into error when we develop our new instrument of directunderstanding. It is vital that the Adept should train his intellectualfaculties to the truth, in the measure of their capacity. To despise the mind onaccount of its limitations is the most disastrous blunder; it is the commoncause of the calamities which strew so many shores with the wreckage of theMystic Armada. Bigotry, Arrogance, Bewilderment, all forms of mental and moraldisorder, so often observed in people of great spiritual attainment, havebrought the Path itself into discredit; almost all such catastrophes are due totrying to build the Temple of the Spirit without proper attention to the mentallaws of structure and the physical necessities of foundation. The mind must bebrought to its utmost pitch of perfection, but according to its own internalproperties; one cannot feed a microscope on mutton chops. It must be regarded asa mechanical instrument of knowledge, independent of the personality of itspossessor. One must treat it exactly as one treats one's electroscope or one'seyes; one influence of one's wishes. A physician calls in a colleague to attendto his own family, knowing that personal anxiety may derange his judgment. Amicroscopist who trusts his eyes when his pet theory is at stake may falsify thefacts, and find too late that he has made a fool of himself.In the case of initiation itself, history is scarred with the wounds inflictedby this Dagger. It reminds us constantly of the danger of relying upon theintellectual faculties. A judge must know the law in every point, and bedetached from personal prejudices, and incorruptible, or iniquity will triumph.Dogma, with persecution, delusion, paralysis of progress, and many another evil,as its satraps, has always established a tyranny when Genius has proclaimed it.Islam making a bonfire of written Wisdom, and Haeckel forging biologicalevidence; physicists ignorant of radioactivity disputing the conclusions ofgeology, and theologians impatient of truth struggling against the tide ofthought; all such must perish at the hands of their own error in making theirminds, internally defective or externally deflected, the measure of theUniverse.8 [part0017.html#chap8-fnt8] See, for the formula of IAF, or rather FIAOF,Book 4 Part III, Chapter V.

The Gnostic Initiatestransliterated it to imply their own secret formulae; we follow so excellent anexample. ON is an Arcanum of Arcana; its significance is taught, gradually inthe O.T.O. Also AD is the paternal formula, Hadit; ON is its complement NUIT;the final Yod signifies “mine” etymologically and essentially the Mercurial(transmitted) hermaphroditic virginal seed—The Hermit of the Taro—The use of thename is therefore to invoke one's own inmost secrecy, considered as the resultof the conjunction of Nuit and Hadit. If a second A is included, its import isto affirm the operation of the Holy Ghost and the formulation of the Babe in theEgg, which precedes the appearance of the Hermit.13 [part0017.html#chap8-fnt13] A thorough comprehension of psycho-analysis willcontribute notably to the proper appreciation of this Ritual.14 [part0017.html#chap8-fnt14] It is said among men that the word Hell derivethfrom the word “helan,” to hele or conceal, in the tongue of the Anglo-Saxons.That is, it is the concealed place, which since all things are in thine ownself, is the unconscious, Liber CXI (Aleph) chap. images [../images/00074.jpeg].15 [part0017.html#chap8-fnt15] But compare the use of the same word in sectionC.16 [part0017.html#chap8-fnt16] That is, Yod Hé realizing Themselves, Will andUnderstanding, in the twins Vau Hé, Mind and Body.17 [part0017.html#chap8-fnt17] But see also the general solution of the Riddleof Existence in The Book of the Law and its Comment—Part IV of Book 4.18 [part0017.html#chap8-fnt18] Commonly identified as The Equinox Vol. III. No.I (The Blue Equinox) (York Beach, ME: Samuel Weiser, 1973).—Ed.19 [part0017.html#chap8-fnt19] If we adopt the new orthography VIAOV (Book 4Part III, Chap. V) we must read “The Sun-6-the-Son,” etc., for “all”; andelaborate this interpretation here given in other ways, accordingly. Thus O (orF) will now be “The Fifteen by function” instead of “Five,” etc., and “in actfree, firm, aspiring, ecstatic,” rather than “gentle,” etc., as in the presenttext.20 [part0017.html#chap8-fnt20] There is an alternative spelling TzBA—F wherethe Root, “an Host,” has the value of 93. The Practicus should revive thisRitual throughout in the Light of his personal researches in the Qabalah, andthus make it his own peculiar property. The spelling here suggested implies thathe who utters the Word affirms his allegiance to the symbols 93 and 6; that heis a warrior in the army of Will and of the Sun. 93 is also the number of AIWAZand 6 of The Beast.21 [part0017.html#chap8-fnt21] The consonants of LOGOS, “Word,” add (Hebrewvalues) to 93. And EPH, “Words” (whence ‘Epic’) has also that value: EIΔE TA EΠHmight be the phrase here intended: its number is 418. This would then assert theaccomplishment of the Great Work; this is the natural conclusion of the Ritual.Cf. CCXX. III. 75.22 [part0017.html#chap8-fnt22] These needs are modified during the process ofInitiation both as to quantity and quality. One should not become anxious aboutone's physical or mental health on a priori grounds, but pay attention only toindubitable symptoms of distress should such arise.23 [part0017.html#chap8-fnt23] The Oracles of Zoroaster utter this:“And when, by often invoking, all the phantasms are vanished, thoushalt see that Holy and Formless Fire, that Fire which darts and flashesthrough all the Depths of the Universe; hear thou the Voice of the Fire!“A similar Fire flashingly extending through the rushings of Air, or a Fireformless whence cometh the Image of a voice, or even a flashing Light abounding,revolving, whirling forth, crying aloud. Also there is the vision of thefire-flashing Courser of Light, or also a Child, borne aloft on the shoulders ofthe Celestial Steed, fiery, or clothed with gold, or naked, or shooting with thebow shafts of light, and standing on the shoulders of the horse, then if thymeditation prolongeth itself, thou shalt unite all these symbols into the Formof a Lion.”This passage—combined with several others—is paraphrased in poetry by AleisterCrowley in his Tannäuser. From The Works of Aleister Crowley (Foyers, England:Society for the Propagation of Religious Truth, 1905–7; reprinted by YogiPublications Society in Homewood, IL in 1978).“And when, invoking often, thou shalt seeThat formless Fire; when all the earth is shaken,The stars abide not, and the moon is gone,All Time crushed back into Eternity,The Universe by earthquake overtaken;Light is not, and the thunders roll,The World is done:When in the darkness Chaos rolls againIn the excited brain:Then, O then call not to thy view that visibleImage of Nature; fatal is her name!It fitteth not thy Body to beholdThat living light of Hell,The unluminous, dead flame,Until that body from the crucibleHath passed, pure gold!For, from the confines of material space,The twilight-moving place,The gates of matter, and the dark threshold,Before the faces of the Things that dwellIn the Abodes of Night,Spring into sightDemons, dog-faced, that show no mortal signOf Truth, but desecrate the Light Divine,Seducing from the sacred mysteries.But, after all these Folk of Fear are drivenBefore the avenging levinThat rives the opening skies,Behold that Formless and that Holy FlameThat hath no name;The Fire that darts and flashes, writhes and creepsSnake-wise in royal robeWound round that vanished glory of the globe,Unto that sky beyond the starry deeps,Beyond the Toils of Time,—then formulateIn thine own mind, luminous, concentrate,The Lion of the Light, a child that standsOn the vast shoulders of the Steed of God:Or winged, or shooting flying shafts, or shodWith the flame-sandals.Then, lift up thine hands!Centre thee in thine heart one scarlet thoughtLimpid with brilliance of the Light above!Draw into naughtAll life, death, hatred, love:All self concentrated in the sole desire—Hear thou the Voice of Fire!”24 [part0017.html#chap8-fnt24] See The Equinox I, VIII, 22.25 [part0017.html#chap8-fnt25] A high degree of initiation is required. Thismeans that the process of analysis must have been carried out very thoroughly.The Adept must have become aware of his deepest impulses, and understood theirtrue significance. The “resistance” here mentioned is automatic; it increasesindefinitely against direct pressure. It is useless to try to force oneself inthese matters; the uninitiated Aspirant, however eager he may be, is sure tofail. One must know how to deal with each internal idea as it arises.It is impossible to overcome one's inhibitions by conscious effort; theirexistence justifies them. God is on their side, as on that of the victim inBrowning's Instans Tyrannus. A man cannot compel himself to love, however muchhe may want to, on various rational grounds. But on the other hand, when thetrue impulse comes, it overwhelms all its critics; they are powerless either tomake or break a genius; it can only testify to the fact that it has met itsmaster.26 [part0017.html#chap8-fnt26] Of course, even false tenets and modes of themind are in one sense true. It is only their appearance which alters. Copernicusdid not destroy the facts of nature, or change the instruments of observation.He merely effected a radical simplification of science. Error is really a“fool's knot.” Moreover, the very tendency responsible for the entanglement isone of the necessary elements of the situation. Nothing is wrong in the end; andone cannot reach the “right” point of view without the aid of one's particular“wrong” point. If we reject or alter the negative of a photograph we shall notget a perfect positive.27 [part0017.html#chap8-fnt27] This means, free from ideas, however excellentin themselves, which are foreign to it. For instance, literary interest has noproper place in a picture.28 [part0017.html#chap8-fnt28] Liber AL vel Legis, II, 61–68, where the detailsof the proper technique are discussed.29 [part0017.html#chap8-fnt29] The essence of this matter is that the word AUM,which expresses the course of Breath (spiritual life) from free utterancethrough controlled concentration to Silence, is transmuted by the creation ofthe compound letter MΓN to replace M: that is, Silence is realised as passinginto continuous ecstatic vibration, of the nature of “Love” under “Will” asshewn by MΓN = 40 + 3 + 50 = 93 AΓAΠH, ΘEΛHMA, etc., and the whole word has thevalue of 100, Perfection Perfected, the Unity incompletion, and equivalent to KPthe conjunction of the essential male and female principles.30 [part0017.html#chap8-fnt30] The “normal” intellect is incapable of thesefunctions; a superior faculty must have been developed. As Zoroaster says:“Extend the void mind of thy soul to that Intelligible that thou mayst learn theIntelligible, because it subsisteth beyond Mind. Thou wilt not understand It aswhen understanding some common thing.”31 [part0017.html#chap8-fnt31] This corresponds to the emotional andmetaphysical fog which is characteristic of the emergence of thought fromhomogeneity. The clear and concise differentiation of ideas marks the adultmind.32 [part0017.html#chap8-fnt32] See the maps “Minutum Mundum” in The Equinox 1,2 and 3, and the general relations detailed in Liber 777.33 [part0017.html#chap8-fnt33] For the account of these matters see TheEquinox, Vol. I, “The Temple of Solomon the King,” Liber 418, Liber Aleph, JohnSt. John, The Urn, and Book 4, Part IV [The Book of the Law, with its comment,in preparation].34 [part0017.html#chap8-fnt34] Comments and directions of the present author inbrackets.—Ed.35 [part0017.html#chap8-fnt35] Aleister Crowley, The Equinox, Vol. I No. VIII(York Beach, ME: Samuel Weiser, 1992), p. 18.36 [part0017.html#chap8-fnt36] The Motto of the Adeptus Minor.Chapter Nine1 [part0018.html#chap9-fnt1] The Confessions of Aleister Crowley (London:Penguin/Arkana. 1989).2 [part0018.html#chap9-fnt2] 44 = DM = Blood (Hebrew)3 [part0018.html#chap9-fnt3] See Liber AL vel Legis, III. 23.4 [part0018.html#chap9-fnt4] A cross or X within a circle, or the “Mark ofthe Beast” are both appropriate signs.5 [part0018.html#chap9-fnt5] He also insisted upon doing “Will” before themajor meal of the day.Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.What is thy Will?It is my will to eat and drink.To what end?That my body may be fortified thereby.To what end?That I may accomplish the Great Work.Love is the law, love under willFall to.—From Magick in Theory on Practice (New York: Magickal Childe, 1990), pp.102, 103.

The Greek equivalent of Satanwas the hundred-headed devil Typhon.9 [part0020.html#chap11-fnt9] At the Autumnal Equinox the Scorpion of Scorpiois said to sting the Sun to death as the hours of darkness become greater thanthe hours of sunlight. Apophis is the name for the Egyptian serpent god Apep whois in perpetual battle with the Sun god Ra. Apep triumphs every evening and Rais victorious every morning.10 [part0020.html#chap11-fnt10] Originally a Nubian god, Besz was the Egyptiangod of mischief. In each of the seven Rites of Eleusis there is a character whoinjects a divine element of chaos into the action. This character finallymanifests as the great god Pan himself in the final Rite, Luna. In the Rite ofSol, Satan-Typhon, Scorpio-Apophis, and Besz represent the evil triad of forcesthat conspire together to kill the Sun in classic Sun myths. The three ruffiansof the Masonic Hiramic myth, and Judas, Herod, and Caiaphas in the Christianmyth are just two examples of many.11 [part0020.html#chap11-fnt11] Algernon Charles Swinburne (1837–1909)12 [part0020.html#chap11-fnt12] Until the closing scene (after Sol is slain),the batteries of knocks add to 6, the number of the Sephirah Tiphareth, theSphere of the Sun.13 [part0020.html#chap11-fnt13] In the tarot, “The Destruction of the House ofGod” is another title for Trump XVI, The Tower, which represents Mars.
