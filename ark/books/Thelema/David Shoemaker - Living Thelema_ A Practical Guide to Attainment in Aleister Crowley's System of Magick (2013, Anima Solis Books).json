Life is simpler (at leastsuperficially) without all the self-discipline required of initiates, and onecan easily find a spiritual path with more cultural acceptance and societalsupport mechanisms. There’s a church, mosque, ashram, and new age guru onpractically every block in today’s world, but I had a pretty tall order for anyspiritual system: Give me wonder and mystery, but don’t make me check my brainat the door!This spiritual and intellectual dilemma was more-or-less foreordained for me. Myfather was an atheist philosophy professor, while my mother was a musician andtheologian from a deeply religious upbringing. I had to make sense of thissomehow—to find a way to reconcile these divergent worldviews and appreciate thepositive contributions each perspective had brought to my life. Luckily, myparents were both open-minded enough to give me space to find my own answers.After graduating from college as a psychology major, I set off for graduateschool to become a psychotherapist. I learned all about the mainstreamcognitive-behavioral approaches to therapy, but the work of Carl Jung and otherso-called ‘depth’ psychologists was always tugging at my sleeve. After a fewyears of exploration, I stumbled upon the work of Israel Regardie and, shortlythereafter, Aleister Crowley and Thelema. I had finally found the solution to myspiritual dilemma. Here was a path of passion, devotion, mystery andtranscendence; yet it was to be executed with scientific rigor and a healthydose of skepticism. “The Method of Science, The Aim of Religion.” Here I couldunify the best parts of the divergent perspectives my parents had shown to meinto a coherent whole, and forge a path uniquely my own. I immediately set aboutcontacting all the Thelemic groups I could find in those preinternet days, andin the fall of 1993 my journey into initiation formally began. I joined OrdoTempli Orientis, and I committed myself to the student path of A.·.A.·..Before long, I found myself in the position of assisting in the training of morejunior initiates, reviewing their assignments, teaching and testing them onvarious magical techniques, and evaluating their diaries. I moved to Californiaand began to work under the direct tutelage of Phyllis Seckler (Soror Meral).Within a few months, I had advanced to various administrative positions in theorders with which I was working, and was spending about as much time with mymagical pursuits as my day job. I have seen several generations of studentssucceed and fail, and entire magical orders come and go. I have consulted withstudents on the mechanics of ritual, as well as the triumphs and tragedies oftheir personal lives. In writing this book, it is my hope that I can communicatethe insights I’ve gained over the past twenty years, as I’ve witnessed theday-to-day strivings of modern magical aspirants. I have learned from experiencewhat works and what doesn’t, and the pitfalls that face seekers in ourtradition.I have designed this book to be a useful reference at every stage of the path.Once you’ve read the source materials from Crowley and others, you should beable to pick up this book and get valuable advice on how best to execute thosesource materials, whatever your level of experience. Beginning students canlearn how to get the most out of basic rituals like Liber Resh, and how tounderstand concepts like the True Will; while intermediate and advancedmagicians can get helpful advice on pursuing the deeper work of A.·.A.·., anddiscover ways to enrich their existing practice with new perspectives on thefoundational materials.How to Use this BookThis book is not intended to be a comprehensive survey of all the concepts andpractices of the Thelemic path of attainment. Rather, I have chosen those topicswhere I felt there was the greatest need for practical commentary, and where Icould offer a unique perspective on the material. I certainly have no illusionsthat my take on all these topics is the best or the only way to think aboutthem. Accordingly, I encourage you to approach everything in this book with yourcritical thinking skills fully engaged, and with an attitude of balancedskepticism.I am assuming that the reader has a basic grounding in the fundamentalprinciples and commonly used terms relevant to the Thelemic worldview. I am alsoassuming that you will have copies (printed or online) of the relevant sourcetexts available. Rituals and other instructions will not usually be reprinted infull. Please refer to the multimedia resources available at livingthelema.comand the Living Thelema YouTube channel for demonstrations and additionalinstruction.I have included performance notes and other comments concerning a few of thebasic rituals you are likely to encounter in your magical path. While someminimal ritual outlines are provided, I have elected to emphasize the variousexperiential aspects of ritual performance rather than focusing primarily on themechanics of the ritual. As with much of the rest of this book, my aim is tohelp you deepen your practice of these rituals, to give a greater context fortheir use, and to enhance the inner energetic patterns that make them come tolife in your daily work. Even where I delve into theory, I have tried toemphasize how the theory can inform your practice, and help you understand theexperiences likely awaiting you on your path.There is no substitute for working with a competent personal teacher within astructured training system. A basic course of training within a well-run magicalorder will give you a solid, internally consistent foundation on which to buildall your later work. The Temple of the Silver Star, the International College ofThelema, Ordo Templi Orientis, and A.·.A.·. are designed accomplish such goals,and I encourage you to explore the training offered by these organizations usingthe contact information given at the end of this book.If you belong to a magical order that teaches its own versions of the ritualsand other practices discussed in this book, I suggest that you consult with yourassigned teacher before incorporating any of this material into your dailypractice. One of the benefits of being in such an order is the internalconsistency of ritual practices, gestures, and symbol sets, and you shouldn’tcomplicate your progress with clashing systems and practices.Let’s take a look at the different sections of the book, so you’ll know what toexpect. Each section approaches the Thelemic path of attainment from a slightlydifferent vantage point.Part OneIn Part One, we will review some of the underlying principles of Thelemicattainment, and discuss an array of practical tools you can use as you progressin your path. Some of you may be relatively new to the concepts of Qabalah, so Ihave included an introductory essay on this topic as the first chapter. If youhave a solid grounding in Qabalistic theory, you can safely skip this chapterand move on to the more advanced material beyond.Included in Part One are practical discussions concerning many of thefoundational ritual and meditative practices of Thelemic magick and mysticism,as well as a review of associated tools such as astral projection, devotionalpractices, and sexual magick. If you are new to magical practice, these chapterswill give you plenty of material for months or years of experimentation.Experienced practitioners will, I hope, find their work refreshed with newperspectives on these tools. In keeping with my aim for this book, I haveavoided undue emphasis on historical or philosophical details in favor ofpractical and experientially useful guidance.Additional audio/visual materials, including demonstrations of some of the basicpractices presented here as well as additional rituals, are available atlivingthelema.com and the Living Thelema YouTube channel.Part TwoIn Part Two, we take a step back from the specific tools discussed in Part One,and focus on broader conceptualizations of the magical path itself. Here, wewill discuss the path of attainment in light of the training methodologies ofA.·.A.·., the Trumps of the Tarot, the chakras, and a number of other symbolictemplates that give unique perspectives on the path.This section of the book will give you an opportunity to ‘pull back the camera’a bit, so that you may better understand the transformative processes takingplace within you as you progress in the Great Work. Special emphasis is given tovarious ways of understanding the path toward the Knowledge and Conversation ofthe Holy Guardian Angel, and the later ordeal of ‘crossing the Abyss,’ as theseare the critical events in the magical career of any seeker.Part ThreeIn the final section of the book, we will bring our discussion to a close with areview of various techniques and tools for managing the challenges of everydaylife. To a great extent, these tools reflect an integration of my experiences asa Jungian and cognitive-behavioral therapist with the principles of magick.After twenty years of treating patients and training magicians, I think I have afew useful tricks up my sleeve!Love is the law, love under will.Sacramento, CaliforniaSummer Solstice, 2013 e.v."},{"pageContent":"PART ONE: TOOLS FORTHE JOURNEY"},{"pageContent":"1 AN INTRODUCTION TO THE QABALAH{A different version of this essay originally appeared in the Instructor’sManual of Fadiman and Frager’s Personality and Personal Growth, an undergraduatepsychology textbook. As such, it was designed to introduce the Qabalah to a layaudience with no prior exposure to the material, with an emphasis on practicalapplication in a psychotherapeutic setting. While it does not utilize explicitlyThelemic terminology, it describes universal processes that form the foundationof Thelemic magical and mystical practice. It is included here as a basicintroduction to Qabalistic concepts, particularly the psychological aspects ofQabalah which you may find especially useful as you progress. As it was writtenmore than fifteen years ago, it does not reflect my most developed thinking onthe matter, but I offer it here in the hope that it may be helpful forbeginners.}INTRODUCTIONThe past few decades have seen the increasing acceptance of Eastern philosophiesinto the mainstream of Western thought and culture. The importance of this trendto the field of psychology has been passionately and effectively argued in thepresent textbook and elsewhere. While the text focuses specifically on thepsychological aspects of Sufi, Buddhist, and Yoga traditions, the latter part ofthe 20th century saw yet another mystical system come into mainstream awareness:the Qabalah. The Qabalah expounds a remarkably rich and complex transpersonalpsychology; a psychology which has much to offer this modern society in searchof depth, meaning and purpose in life.The Qabalah is the name for the mystical branch of the Jewish tradition. Theword Qabalah itself is derived from the Hebrew linguistic root kabal, whichliterally means “to receive” (Kaplan, 1991). The Qabalistic goal was thereforeto receive illumination and wisdom from the divine. Much of the Qabalisticteachings and methodology involved understanding this process of divinetransmission and developing the spiritual capacity to retain and integrate thedivine influx. This was accomplished through various practices designed to helpcreate and strengthen a spiritual “receptacle,” often referred to in Qabalisticliterature as a keli—a spiritual vessel.MAJOR CONCEPTS, STRUCTURE, AND DYNAMICSThe Qabalah simultaneously describes (a) the process of the divine creation ofthe universe, and the Mind of God, (b) the structure and function of the humanpsyche, and (c) the “Way of Return” which reunites the human psyche and soulwith their divine source.The Creation of the UniverseQabalistic traditions describe the creation of the universe as a series ofprogressive emanations of deity. They originate in the great nothingness, ain,and gradually take the form of ten sephiroth (spheres), and the twenty-two pathsthat connect them. Together, the sephiroth and the connecting paths form the etzchayim, or Tree of Life—a map of all universal possibilities. The Tree of Lifenot only represents the process of creation—it is also a depiction of the “mindof God,” and by coming into an understanding of its varied aspects, Qabalistsbelieve they draw closer to divinity itself.[images/00021.jpg]The Tree of LifeThe ten sephiroth describe the process of universal creation throughincreasingly complex and diversified forms. They symbolize all possible statesof being, and they form an all-inclusive catalog of the ideas and manifestationsof the divine Mind. The paths, meanwhile, show the states of change and fluxbetween these states of being. The process of creation moves down the Treecorresponding to the numerical order of the sephiroth. Although the ideasassociated with the spheres and paths are extremely complex and far-reaching,the names of the sephiroth give a good indication of the basic conceptsinvolved. These names and their English translations are given below. 1 Kether Crown 2 Chokmah Wisdom 3 Binah Understanding 4 Chesed Mercy 5 GeburahStrength 6 Tiphereth Beauty 7 Netzach Victory 8 Hod Splendor 9 Yesod Foundation10 Malkuth KingdomEssentially, the progression from Kether to Malkuth involves the descent of thedivine from the primal, singular point of Kether, through the archetypalrealities associated with the spheres of Chokmah through Yesod, and culminatingin the physical, manifest universe at Malkuth. With each step downward, thedivine becomes increasingly dense and multi-faceted, as it takes on thecharacteristics of each successive sephira.> > …imagine a ray of sunlight shining through a stained-glass window of ten> > different colors.

Yet by emanating through the sefirot—the> > variegated stained glass—judgment or compassion prevails (Matt, 1994, p.38).The Human Psyche[images/00006.jpg]The Qabalistic ‘Parts of the Soul’ on the Tree of LifeThe highest, most spiritual aspect of the psyche is known as yechidah(yeh-khee-dah). This is the essence of Spirit, and is our primary linkage tocollective consciousness and universal energies. As such, it is akin to theJungian concept of the Self. Much of the psychospiritual work in Qabalisticpsychology is directed toward a conscious union of the “lower” aspects ofourselves with this inner spark of Spirit. On the Tree of Life, yechidah residesat Kether, the point from which all creation emanates. This parallel between theSource of universal creation, and the Source of individual consciousness, is ofparamount importance, as we will see in the discussion of the Way of Returnbelow.Emerging from yechidah are the complementary principles of chiah (khee-ah), thelife-force and spiritual Will, and neshamah (neh-shah-mah), the receptive,intuitive faculty which gives shape and meaning to this life force. Chiah isassigned to the sephira of Chokmah, and neshamah to Binah. The neshamah is thespiritual intuition, the enlightening and awakening energy that descends frompure spirit to those who are ready to receive it. Stated in more conventionalpsychological terms: to promote psychospiritual growth, we must tap into thedivine, intuitive wisdom of the Self by forging a link between it and ourconscious ego.The conscious mind is made up of a number of energies collectively known as theruach (roo-akh), which literally means “breath,” but implies the idea of thevital life force as well. Compare this with the Latin spiritus, Greek pneuma,Chinese chi and Sanskrit prana, all of which equate the breath with thelife-force. The implication is that the mind, the ruach, is ever-flowing andfull of life-energy, like the air we breathe. The ruach is analogous to theJungian ego in its fullest sense—the totality of conscious self-awareness.Shaping the ruach into a fit vessel for the influx of spiritual insight from“above” is the characteristic work of a number of systems of transpersonalpsychology as well as many mystical traditions. This is akin to the ego-Selflinkage described above. As another metaphorical example of this process,consider the Sufi concept of being filled with the “wine” of God.The ruach is composed of five sephiroth on the Tree of Life, each representing aspecific component of human ego-consciousness. These components are summarizedin the table below, along with the sephira to which they are attributed. Memory Chesed Will Geburah Imagination Tiphereth Desire/Emotion NetzachIntellect HodThe Qabalah teaches that our subconscious, instinctual drives and energiesreside in the nephesh (neh-fesh). The nephesh is associated with the sephiraYesod, and is very much like the Jungian personal unconscious, or the Freudianid. It is a wellspring of powerful energy, which must be examined, explored, andput to constructive use to avoid blockage, repression, obsession, and illness.That is, the ruach must be the master of these energies, and not the other wayaround. The vital, instinctual forces of the nephesh must be harnessed toconstructive, conscious direction by the ruach, so they may be applied to thework of psychospiritual growth and balance. This process is not unlike thatdescribed in some yoga traditions, with their emphasis on utilizing thekundalini for personal transformation.Finally, the human body itself is often called the guph (goof) in Qabalistictraditions. On the Tree of Life, the guph is placed at Malkuth. Notaccidentally, the guph and the nephesh are adjacent, suggesting their intimatelyintertwined functions. That is, there are close connections between theautonomic nervous system, the instincts, the unconscious mind, and the entirehuman body. To the human being in his or her natural state, these bodily andinstinctual aspects of self, and not the ruach, are the most directly receptiveto spiritually informed intuitive insights. Accordingly, it is taught withinsome Qabalistic traditions that our spirit is more immediately and closely tiedto our bodies, our instincts and our unconscious minds than to our consciousminds. It is only when we have progressed on the Way of Return that the linkbetween the conscious ruach and the super-conscious neshamah is solidified.The Way of ReturnThe Way of Return is the Qabalistic term describing the process of reuniting theincarnate human personality with its divine Source. Just as the universe (andeach human being) was created in a “top down” process descending from Kether, somust each human seek to return to God in an upward path from Malkuth. This is anelegant and uniquely Qabalistic restatement of the mystical path common to allesoteric traditions. That is, by retracing the process through which we cameinto being, we may discover the divine nature within us, and transcend thelimitations of physical existence.The beginnings of the Way of Return may be visualized as the construction of acup or similar vessel. The raw material of this cup is, of course, the humanpersonality in its inert, unexalted state—the sheet metal from which the cupwill be fashioned, if you will. Just as any cup’s purpose is to contain aliquid, the purpose of the human personality is to become a literal containerfor the “liquid” of divine inspiration—that which the Sufis might describe asthe wine of God. Yet we must fashion ourselves as a balanced, stable cup, withno holes and a sturdy base, if we are to be successful. Therefore, much of thepsychospiritual work of the first steps on the Way of Return consists ofequilibrating our personality, and eliminating those defects in “construction”which would hamper our receptivity to the divine.Carl Jung believed we should strive for balance of the four functions ofpersonality: thinking, feeling, sensation, and intuition. Similarly, the firstfour steps on the Way of Return—that is, the passage through the spheres ofMalkuth, Yesod, Hod and Netzach—can be seen as an equilibration of the aspectsof human existence to which they correspond. In the Hermetic Qabalah, thesespheres are attributed to Earth, Air, Water and Fire, respectively.Psychologically speaking, these represent the faculties of sensation, commonintuition, intellect, and emotion or desire, paralleling Jung’s functionsmentioned above. It is only when these aspects of the lower human personalityare brought into balance that the vessel is prepared for the conscious influx ofthe divine light.The fifth step on the Way of Return brings the Qabalist to the sphere ofTiphereth, at the center of the Tree of Life. This stage marks the literaldawning of the spiritual light, for indeed Tiphereth is the sphere attributed tothe sun in Hermetic Qabalah. Having fashioned a suitable vessel, the Qabalisthas in essence performed an invocation to the highest forces within himself orherself, inviting that divine light to take up residence in the formerly mundanehuman life. Another appropriate metaphor for this process is that of thelightning rod. If it is built correctly, its very nature is to bring forth thesurge of electricity from above. Similarly, the equilibrated human psyche is alightning rod for the divine presence. If correctly formed, it cannot help butbring forth spiritual enlightenment.The Way of Return beyond Tiphereth is marked by a progressively more intimaterelationship between the lower human personality and the divine. If the stepsbefore Tiphereth were somewhat like a courtship, and the attainment of Tipheretha wedding, then the remaining Way of Return can be likened to the ongoingmarital relationship. The ultimate goal is to be wholly reunited with God at thesphere of Kether.In the Hermetic Qabalah, tradition holds that this ongoing relationship betweenthe personality and the divine brings all the benefits associated withpsychological and spiritual growth: a sense of purpose and meaning, inner peace,harmony between the self and the world, and the ability to mobilize more fullyour inner resources in service of our life goals, for the benefit of ourselvesand humanity.Gematria and the Esoteric Interpretation of ScriptureOne important practice within Qabalistic traditions is the esotericinterpretation of scripture through the use of gematria, a means of translatingany Hebrew word or phrase into a numerical value. This practice is rooted in thefact that the ancient Hebrew culture did not possess a separate number system;each letter of the Hebrew alphabet represented a particular number, andtherefore any representation of numbers involved an alphabetic expression.Conversely, any word or phrase had an implied numerical value. By examining thenumerical values of key words and phrases in scripture, Qabalists are able toextract relationships between concepts that otherwise would remain invisible. Togive one simple example, the Hebrew words for “love” (ehebah) and “unity”(achad) both have the numerical value of 13. A Qabalist might therefore concludethat there is a particular esoteric relationship between these concepts, andthis insight might allow for certain texts to be interpreted in ways far deeperthan their surface meaning would suggest.PRACTICAL APPLICATIONSEven in a purely secular context, the Qabalah lends itself readily to an arrayof applications, including therapeutic and “self-help” interventions. Let usfirst examine applications in psychotherapy settings. As you will have notedfrom the discussion above, Qabalistic theory overlaps nicely with depthpsychology approaches such as those of Freud and Jung. Furthermore, Qabalah’sintegrative psychospiritual perspective resonates well with modern transpersonalapproaches such as those of Roberto Assagioli and others. A therapistwell-versed in Qabalistic theory and practice will be able to use his or herunderstanding of the Way of Return, as it relates to the balancing of thepersonality and the search for meaning and purpose, to aid clients in need ofguidance.Furthermore, the sephirothic model of human consciousness, as well as the natureof the paths between the spheres, can guide the therapist in understanding theparticular life transitions, challenges, and obstacles facing the client at anygiven time. For example, we have seen that the sphere of Hod is associated withthe human intellect, and the sphere of Netzach with emotion. A therapist workingwith a client who seems to be overly intellectual might diagnose a need toincrease the Netzach/emotional focus in the client’s life. This might beaccomplished by utilizing the many traditional characteristics of Netzach, suchas the ideas of love, desire, and devotion, in the design of a meditative orritual program. The client might be encouraged to meditate on the above ideas asthey apply to his or her relationships, or to undertake a walking meditationthrough a place of beauty such as a garden or other natural setting. Thepossibilities for applications of this sort are only limited by the creativityand experience of the therapist.It is important to note that while it may seem otherwise, the Qabalah is not arigidly linear model. The tradition holds that in the course of human life, anindividual will find themselves at various ‘places’ on the Tree of Life on manydifferent occasions. For example, we do not experience the sphere of Hod onlyonce as we ascend the Tree, but each and every time the intellectual aspect ofour personality is activated. Furthermore, the processes of change representedby the paths between the spheres on the Tree appear as the various lifechallenges, obstacles, and opportunities for growth that confront us in anymanner of ways throughout our lives. To give another example, the pathconnecting the spheres of Hod and Netzach is seen as a symbol of the challengeof balancing intellect and emotion. It is easy to see how such a challengepresents itself time and time again in our lives, and “traversing” this path istherefore a repeated and lifelong process. The therapist’s task in such a caseis to be sensitive to this ongoing flux in the client’s growth process, andguide the client toward equilibrium and insight at every step of the way. Thetherapist is a guide and coach, but does not take responsibility for theclient’s own choices and actions. Rather, the therapist encourages the client toassume full responsibility for his or her own destiny. It is her task to makechoices and create desired realities as her/his life path unfolds itself,bringing with it a sense of greater meaning and purpose.Another application of the Qabalah is in a self-help context. As shown above,the model of the Tree of Life, with all its paths and spheres, is a complex andflexible symbolic system. Since each path and sphere embodies a certain qualityor process, it is possible to develop a personal system of classification oflife experiences based on the Tree. For example, a student of the Qabalah mightwish to gain greater understanding of the workings of his or her personality. Toaccomplish this, s/he might begin a daily journal in which he monitors her/hisdaily experiences and classifies them according to the four lowest sephiroth onthe Tree, which were shown above to roughly correspond to the four Jungianfunctions. So for each daily entry, he would record the extent to which thenatures of Malkuth, Yesod, Hod, and Netzach were prominent in his experiencethat day. After a few days or weeks of this monitoring, it is likely thatpatterns, biases, overemphasized tendencies would become apparent, andcorrective steps could be taken.Another student might wish to gain insight into the higher principles of Mercy(Chesed) and Severity (Geburah) operative in her life. She or he would monitorouter and inner experiences and classify each as either expansive, peaceful andgrowth-promoting (Chesed), or as energetic, severe and seemingly restrictive(Geburah). Thus, s/he might gain a greater appreciation for the ebb and flow ofthese opposing forces not only in his or her own personality, but also in thelife events that shape her experience each day. This type of practice, whenpursued with brutal honesty and conscious intent, can potentially lead to evenmore exalted levels of consciousness—direct awareness the spiritual self within,of the nature of life, and of the interconnectedness of the universe as a whole.In other words, what begins as a psychological exploration may open the door tomystical experience itself.Recommended Reading:Epstein, P.

At some points, he described the Holy Guardian Angel as if it weresynonymous with the Higher Self—an aspect of our own conscious or unconsciousexistence. At other times, he quite definitively characterized the Holy GuardianAngel as an external entity of some sort. For example, his experience with hisown Holy Guardian Angel, Aiwass, was of such a quality during the dictation ofThe Book of the Law, that he perceived it as an external voice dictating to him.Given all of this, the HGA is one of the most difficult things for a magician toexplain or discuss, so please bear with me as I attempt to use inevitablyinadequate language to delve into these matters.In the system of A.·.A.·., from the very beginning, the path towards Knowledgeand Conversation is of singular importance. All of the tasks in the A.·.A.·.curriculum up to the Adeptus Minor grade are designed to be stepping stonestowards Knowledge and Conversation. These tools come in several varieties:magical rituals, meditation, the gradual raising of the kundalini throughvarious practices, devotional practices, and so on; but the important thing tonote here is that all of these really are simply tools to be used to attainKnowledge and Conversation. After the K & C, when the knowledge of the True Willis consciously and deeply ingrained in our everyday living, we can choose to doa magical ritual and be assured that it is in line with our True Will. This israrely the case before Knowledge and Conversation.Unfortunately, this fact has often caused people to ignore basic training inritual and other practices because they believe that they are not going to “getit right” until they’ve had Knowledge and Conversation. It is essential toremember that the only way we learn to do things is through experimentation. Noone at the beginning of the path is going to have the level of insight intotheir tools, their methods, or their True Will that further attainments willbring. So start wherever you are, practice, make mistakes, learn from them…andwrite it all down in your diary!Let’s look at the building experience of the Holy Guardian Angel as it tends tomanifest in the lives of aspirants. One of the most common misconceptions aboutthe way this typically occurs is that there is no knowledge of the Holy GuardianAngel—no conscious connection—then one attains to the Adeptus Minor grade ofA.·.A.·. and in a single flash of light it’s suddenly there. For most peopleI’ve supervised, as well as in my own path, that’s not the way it tends tounfold. Generally, there is a gradually increasing intimacy of communication andunderstanding that begins far earlier on the path than Adeptus Minor. We feelthe impulses and subtle urgings of the Angel in dreams, intuitive flashes, andsynchronistic events. In those moments, when we seem to be receiving impulsesfrom a deep level of consciousness or we have an abiding sense of the rightnessof a certain choice, we are seeing a glimmer of the HGA. Likewise, our strivingsfor beauty in our lives, our drive to be enraptured in the things and the peoplewe love—all of these are glimmers of the Angel as well.There is communication with the HGA well before Adeptus Minor, to be sure, butit tends to come through our own unconscious mind, and in the language ofsymbol. Our experience of this is such that we may not sense a consciouscommunication at all for quite some time, but we gradually improve our abilityto speak in the language of symbol. Hence, the requirement in A. A. and otherorders to memorize the various correspondences, for such symbols are in onesense the ‘native tongue’ of the Angel.[images/00024.jpg]The Tree of Life and the Grades of A∴A∴Eventually, we begin to perceive these communications in a much more direct andconscious manner. In the system of A.·.A.·., the so-called Vision of the HolyGuardian Angel is attributed to Malkuth, which is the sephira of the Neophyte(1°=10[images/00025.jpg]) grade. It is often in the Neophyte grade thataspirants begin to have more of these conscious communications, sometimes eventhe name of the Angel. It is a courtship—a gradually increasing and intensifyingintimacy, a gradual improving of our ability to perceive the language of the HGAin our lives. Finally, at the Adeptus Minor (5°= 6[images/00025.jpg]) grade, thebreakthrough of Briatic consciousness into our previously Yetzirah-bound mindforges a conscious link.The defining characteristic of the adept is that he or she can communicate withthe Angel consciously and at will. What is this process like? It is essentiallythe ability to differentiate that one voice of the HGA from all the other voicesthat speak to us in various ways in our lives. In many ways, it is like a radioreceiver. Our conscious mind is the radio; we turn the dial trying to find thatone particular station we’re looking for. In the pre-adept stage of the work, wesweep the dial, searching somewhat blindly for the station. Occasionally we movepast it and get a little snippet of the Angel’s voice, but then we have troublefinding it again. The goal is to develop the ability to quickly, precisely andreliably tune in to that station, and keep it there.Another metaphor may be useful here. As shown above, the sphere of Tipherethrepresents the Adeptus Minor grade of the A. A. where conscious communion withthe Angel is attained. Tiphereth is like the head of the king, and Kether is thecrown. The Great Work, quite simply, is all about getting your head in the rightplace—the receptive awareness of Tiphereth—so that the crown can be placed onyour head. In other words, it is less about ‘going somewhere’ looking for theAngel and more about refining your awareness such that you are ready to receivewhat is right there waiting for you. Perhaps this is one way of understandingthe import of Liber LXV, Cap. II, where we read, “to await Thee is the end, notthe beginning.”Many aspirants find that the process of moving towards Knowledge andConversation consists of successive layers of instruction in the methods ofproperly invoking the angel. You will very likely discover that everything youare, everything you have been, and everything you love and find beautiful, willbe utilized as a tool in the invocation of your HGA. As you move through thegrades of the A.·.A.·. below Tiphereth, you will likely receive successivelayers of instruction in how to hone and finely tune your ability to embark onthe final invocation process.As long as you are forging ahead with the great tasks, as long as you areenflaming yourself in prayer, invoking often, devoting yourself to pushing aheadon the path towards Knowledge and Conversation, you will undergo thesesuccessive layers of instruction from the HGA. You will get a name, an impulseto pursue a particular line of work, a mode of meditation, or other such tools.You may find that later on, you receive additional instruction that supersedesor completely overturns what was given to you before. That’s the nature of thisWork: as you refine your tools of reception, as you get better at tuning thatradio dial, and finding that one voice, you will quite naturally cast aside someof the things that you’ve been given earlier. If you persist, you will refineyour own tools to enable you to hear and recognize the voice of the Angelclearly, and at exactly the right time. In fact, such progress is inevitable ifyou follow the path as instructed.While no one can tell you exactly what your path may bring, and how it mayunfold, it is useful to ponder the experience of adepts who have walked similarroads. I’d like you to consider something my teacher Phyllis Seckler (SororMeral) wrote late in her life about her own Holy Guardian Angel experience:> > > The first stirrings of the angelic voice may come to us through intuition.> > > If a person isn’t open to relying on this deep intuition, it may not be> > > evident that the Holy Guardian Angel can speak through the same voice.

But the system ofA.·.A.·. exists so that those a few paces ahead of us can light beacons forthose who follow, as has occurred throughout the full span of human history. Itis my hope that the words in this chapter may serve as one such beacon. May youattain to the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel!"},{"pageContent":"3 THE TRUE WILLIn this chapter, we’ll explore what the True Will means in daily life, inmagical practice, and in spiritual advancement. In doing so, we will unveil someof the mystery in the way the True Will actually unfolds in a humanlife—especially, of course, for someone trying to build their consciousunderstanding of the True Will, such as many of you reading this book.I’m sure many of you have some basic familiarity with the term ‘True Will,’ butjust in case, I want to define it here briefly. First of all, the ‘will’ inquestion is the same as the will implied by the word thelema itself, which isthe Greek word for will. This is not the simple will of the ego or the whim ofthe personality. This is not merely “wanting something.” It is a deeper level oflife purpose, and the living out of that purpose in an individual lifetime andacross multiple incarnations.The True Will is the will of the deepest inmost Self—the core of who you reallyare as a spiritual being. Also, and importantly, it is an expression of theuniversal will, as particularized and expressed in your individual life. This iswhy, when we are living in accordance with our True Will, we find that much ofthe time the universe seems to open up a path right in front of us, as if insympathy with our aims. Likewise, when we feel as though we are swimmingupstream against life it is very often the case that we have veered a bit fromthe path of our True Will; or perhaps we’re receiving a lesson from the HGAand/or the universe itself that is helping to nudge us back onto the path.The understanding of the True Will is dramatically enhanced with the Knowledgeand Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel; but much like the ongoing intimacyof the courtship of adept and Angel as the adept moves across the grades of thefirst order of A.·.A.·., the knowledge of the True Will unfolds in a progressivemanner as we peel back the layers of our personality to discover what is at itscore.All too often, the True Will is erroneously conceptualized as a singular choiceof a career or a single task to be accomplished in life. This is far toorestrictive. The True Will is the essence of your Self. It encompasses you, youractions, your thoughts, your feelings, and your behaviors; and it pertains tothe way you live, moment-to-moment, as well as the entire arc of your lifeitself—and even beyond one life into other incarnations. As you can see, it’sreally much, much more than a choice of career or a single task to complete.There is often, however, a great deal of overlap between the True Will and whatone chooses to spend one’s time doing in life—one’s occupation or favoritehobbies, for example.The True Will is very likely to overlap with your passions, your interests andyour preferences, but not always. On the other hand, we’ve established that thisis not the simple will of the ego-personality (or, in the terms of Qabalisticpsychology, the ruach.) Sometimes we find that our True Will—which ideally ourego is here to facilitate—is not necessarily something that is going to becomfortable and perfectly harmonious with the ego’s conceptions of itself. Youmay find yourself, at times, feeling surprised by what you discover about yourTrue Will. But even more frequently, you may find that the discovery of the TrueWill forces you to make painful choices about lifestyle, priorities, career,relationships, and many other things. Such growth processes are painfulprecisely because they make us stretch outside our comfort zone; but in thiscase, it’s all in service of making these egoic choices in our day-to-day livesharmonize with the deeper needs of our soul and the commandments of the HGA.Yes, stretching hurts, but if we can come to experience this pain as a marker ofdeep growth, we may come to a greater sense of peace about the process. Just asphysical pain points us to the area in need of healing, so does thispsychological pain inform us about areas in need of growth.As I said earlier, the True Will should equally explain your choices in anygiven moment, and in any given situation, just as well as it explains theoverall path that you take in your life. When you contemplate your True Will,you should try to take a step back from your everyday circumstances, career andlife choices and think about it this way: the True Will will explain the way youaffect the universe, the choices you make and the paths you tend to take,whether you happen to be a stock broker in New York City, a fisherman inMalaysia, or anything else. In other words, this central truth of who you arewill express itself in a certain way regardless of the mundane situation inwhich you find yourself—your place of birth, occupation, family situation, andso on.Much of the time, the discovery of the True Will is a slow and gradual process,occasionally punctuated by breakthroughs of insight. For example, you may havebeen reflecting on your life choices over the past several years and discoverthat there has been a certain trend that had escaped your notice at the time;but then, in looking back on it, you gain some insight into the True Will. Incontrast, there are those moments when you’ll simply be stopped in your trackswhen a realization appears as an instantaneous flash, causing you to laugh orcry (or both) with the clarity of the insight.The process is incredibly individualized, and no two seekers will experience itspeaks and valleys in the same way. To put it somewhat poetically: Think ofyourself as the prophet of your own Angel—as the high priest or priestess of areligion you are developing that is yours alone. The aim of that religion is todeepen, intensify, and delineate with ever-increasing clarity the mystical andmagical procedures that effectively invoke your Holy Guardian Angel.The development of this religion is essentially the work of the aspirant in thepre-Adeptus Minor stage of the work of A.·.A.·.. Your body and mind are thevessel in which your Angel abides. The purpose of this vessel is to live out theTrue Will, which is the voice of your Angel in your everyday life. Many findthat the name of the Angel itself reveals a certain formula that is one veryimportant key to the True Will. This name, perhaps by the arrangement of theletters, perhaps by some other associations that you develop over time, is aroad map of sorts to the right living of your life.As I mentioned earlier, the understanding of the True Will takes a quantum leapforward with the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, whichoccurs at the Adeptus Minor grade of A. A. corresponding to the sphere ofTiphereth. This stage represents the breakthrough of Briatic consciousness intothe Yetziratic ego-mind. With this attainment, the supernal realm of theneshamah—the spiritual intuition and the voice of the Angel itself—becomesapprehensible to the ruach for the first time. The adept’s awareness of theAngel’s voice is no longer limited to the symbolic language of the nepheshicsubconscious; rather, he or she can receive the instruction of the Angeldirectly into the conscious mind.Let’s review a few practical tools you can use to enhance your understanding ofthe True Will. In some ways, these are almost like mental games to play withyourself as you examine your life and attempt to get a grasp of the Will. Askyourself these questions: How do you change a room when you walk into it? Whataffect do you have on the world around you and on the people in your world?There is something unique about you that will tend to affect the world in fairlypredictable ways. Throughout your life, embodied in your moment-to-momentchoices, there is some quintessential “you-ness” that impacts the world aroundyou—an energetic signature which you leave wherever you go. For example, whenyou walk into a party, the people in the room are impacted in a certain waybecause it was you specifically that walked in. What is the specific nature ofthat impact? Alternatively, think about yourself as a force of nature: windblows, water flows, fire burns, and acid corrodes. What is it that you do to theworld?Ask people who know you fairly well about your strengths and weaknesses. Whatare your talents in their view? Ask a friend. Ask an enemy. Ultimately, anyoneelse’s opinion of you or your True Will doesn’t matter a fraction as much asyour own—but you’ll get some really interesting feedback this way; and ifnothing else, it’s certainly an entertaining exercise!Another one of my favorite techniques involves looking at your liferetrospectively as a story or myth. What myth are you living out? One of theways to examine this is to divide your life into, say, five year segments fromage five onward. Next, reflect on what your passions were during each particularphase of life. Let’s say you’re looking at age five to age ten. What were yourfavorite books, movies, heroes, or songs? Repeat this process for each five yearspan and then try to abstract the broader themes. What sorts of stories havetended to capture you? Slaying dragons? Or perhaps solving mysteries? What wasthe nature of the heroes that captivated you when you were younger? Did youidentify with the wizard or the warrior? The prodigal son, or the wanderinghermit? And so on.Looking across your entire lifetime, you may see these themes develop. Considerthe following list of Georges Polti’s “36 Dramatic Situations.” Polti developedthis list to aid writers, but you may find it interesting to look through thedifferent stories he identifies and see if you can spot a few that haverelevance to your life. This will not necessarily be synonymous with the TrueWill by any means, but it may give you some powerful clues. In some cases, the‘story’ best matching the course of your life will reflect those obstacles inyour personality that have actually limited your ability to tap into True Will.This information is no less useful! When you understand the ways in which yourego traps or blinds you, you have a powerful tool for seeing past such blockagesand perceiving the reality of the Will.The 36 Dramatic Situations3 [index_split_045.html#filepos654731]> > 1.

Because it is something that has seemed perfectly obviousto everyone but them! Naturally, your own insight into your True Will is goingto be much more complex and intricate than what someone else will be able totell you; but don’t be surprised if you come to a sense of clarity about yourTrue Will and it is much less impressive to everyone else than it is to you!Regardless of the particular twists and turns of your path, I am sure you willfind the journey toward understanding the True Will one of the most beguiling,fascinating, frustrating, but ultimately satisfying tasks you will everundertake.Recommended Reading:Hillman, J.

Nevertheless, it is useful to give an overview of the practices availableto the beginner and to discuss the reasons why you might choose one practiceover another. In other words, what are your training goals? What specific skillsare you trying to build as a beginning magician, and how might these aims guideyour choice of practices to undertake? For many aspiring magicians, the goal canbe summed up as follows: “Be an incredibly powerful magician!” Unfortunately, agoal this vague may not be the most useful way of getting started with anyendeavor. The advice I give in this chapter assumes that you are not alreadyworking in a magical order that has assigned (not merely recommended) specifictasks and practices. If you are working in such an order, then you shouldconsult with your teacher before altering your training program in the ways Isuggest here.Here are the training goals that I believe are most essential for the beginningand intermediate magician.1.You need a set of practices that will ensure magical ‘hygiene’—the magicalequivalent of brushing your teeth. You need to be able to cleanse and strengthenyour energy system; to undertake what we might traditionally call fortifying theaura, or charging the body of light.2.You need to build your ability to call forth magical force, and to healthfullytolerate this force in ever-increasing levels of intensity. Furthermore, youneed to strengthen your ability to direct the magical force toward any desiredaim.3.You need to have the basics of yoga in your practice; specifically, asana(posture) and dharana (concentration). These practices will aid in focusing themind. If you haven’t developed the requisite level of mental control outside ofa ritual context, you’re certainly not going to suddenly gain the ability tofocus your mind appropriately when you’re in a magical ritual; and you’reunlikely to be able to direct the force to the desired aim.4.You need to begin internalizing symbol systems, such as the Qabalistic Tree ofLife as a model for your psyche. To do this, you must begin memorizing thecorrespondences related to the sephiroth and the paths on the Tree of Life, asfound in 777 and elsewhere (see Liber O for a list of correspondences to get youstarted). Ultimately, the goal is to build these symbol systems into your dailywork so that you truly live and breathe them, and so you can call upon them withprecision and power when constructing and executing a magical ritual.5.You need to develop the discipline of the magical diary. Frankly, this is justan extension of the self-discipline that’s required for all the above tasks; butthe diary in particular is so fundamental and so important in terms of yourfuture work that you simply must be diligent in its practice right from theoutset of your magical career. Get into the daily rhythm of writing in yourdiary, no matter what!6.Last, but certainly not least, your basic training in magick should begin toforge a conscious link to the Holy Guardian Angel through enflaming yourself inprayer, however you may define it. The exact form is unimportant. The HGA itselfwill gradually reveal all the specifics you need. The real key is in theenflaming. To this end, every magician should include some sort of devotionaland aspirational practices in his or her daily regimen.Now, let’s take a look at how you’re going to achieve these goals, by walkingthrough the different phases of your training and reviewing how these goalsmight unfold. For the purposes of this discussion, I have divided the basictraining into four phases. Some of these may be as brief as a few weeks or less,and some may take months or much longer; but even by phase four this is stilljust basic work. These steps will get you started, but there’s a lifetime ofwork to explore!Phase OneIn Phase One, you’re brand new to magical practice. The most fundamental andimportant practice of all is your ability to let go of outside distractions andrelax your body. Admittedly, it is not very exciting to aspiring magicians whenthey are told that their first course of training is simply to relax; butbelieve me, if you can’t control your level of bodily arousal, how can youpossibly expect to control the far more subtle components of your nature? Ican’t emphasize this point strongly enough.So, in Phase One, you’re going to start every practice session by simply sittingquietly for a few minutes and letting go of any cares and concerns of the outerworld. Simply be in your body and in your temple. Once you’ve settled into acomfortable posture, perhaps one of the asanas illustrated in Liber E orelsewhere, you will begin to work with some form of breathing practice. This isdone not only to deepen the relaxation, but also to form the basic foundationsof pranayama practice that may come later.Israel Regardie suggests a ‘fourfold’ breathing pattern, where you have anevenly spaced breathing pattern of in, hold, out, hold—just for a few secondseach direction. Simply witness the breath, making it regular and rhythmic. Atthis stage, don’t worry about breathing slowly or deeply. Just breathe at anatural rate and depth, and focus on getting that air to the diaphragm andgetting into a regular pattern. Learning to regularize the breathing in this wayenhances your ability to control the energy residing in the breath—an essentialskill for any success in magick (you’ll read much more about this in the chapteron asana and pranayama).Also in Phase One, I suggest you memorize and begin working with Liber Resh velHelios (see Chapter 7) and begin the practice of saying Will at meals. Andthat’s it for Phase One. No pentagram rituals, no evocations of cool-lookingGoetic demons—nothing fancy. Just relaxation, fourfold breathing, Liber Resh,and Will, for at least several weeks. Do your practices at least six days perweek, and record everything meticulously in your magical diary.Again, I recognize that this will likely be a bit anticlimactic to someone who’sexcited to get started with magick; but I assure you, what you’re doing rightnow – psychologically, magically, and physically—will form the foundation forevery single thing you will ever do in your magical career, so please don’tattempt any short cuts! (Besides, if you jump ahead to more advanced practiceswithout forming a strong foundation in the basics, you’ll ultimately just slowyourself down, because you’ll have to come back later to correct the gaps andimbalances. Hardly a ‘short cut’!) After at least a few weeks of Phase One,you’re ready to move on to Phase Two.Phase TwoAt this point, I suggest that you add the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram in bothits Banishing and Invoking forms (see Chapter 5). You may also wish toexperiment with the ritual of the Star Ruby.The reason you should work with both the invoking and banishing forms of the LRPis that the banishing form will help with magical cleansing, while the invokingform is very effective in building your tolerance for magical force, and yourability to call it forth and control it. Both forms of the ritual help you buildthe skill of visualization—the visualizations of the archangels and the drawingof the pentagrams, for example.All of the ritual practices discussed so far will help you begin to internalizethe symbol systems most relevant to the Thelemic magician, such as the pantheonof Nuit, Hadit, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit, the Hebrew hierarchies, the elementalarchangels and so on. For example, you will learn to associate the elementalquarters with the subjective experience of those specific types of energy,thereby building your own inner energetic ‘language’—an essential tool for anymagician.Also in Phase Two, you might wish to add some formal asana (posture) and dharana(concentration) practices (see Chapter 9). Pick any posture, and sit still inthat posture while you begin basic dharana practices. At this stage, I suggest asimple visual focus, such as tejas (a red, upward-pointing equilateraltriangle). Simply hold the visualization as best you can and count the breaks inconcentration. As always, keep good diary records of the conditions and resultsof these experiments.Stay in Phase Two for at least a month. As before, you should always feel freeto extend this period. When you are ready, move to Phase Three.Phase ThreeAt this stage I suggest that you add some form of the Middle Pillar exercise asdescribed by Regardie, including the circulations. In my experience, practicessuch as the Middle Pillar increase ability to call forth, contain, and toleratemagical force. Furthermore, since this practice utilizes the divine namesassociated with certain sephiroth (seen at the various energy centers of thebody) you will reinforce these important correspondences. Finally, and mostimportantly, the Middle Pillar practice gives you another opportunity to enflameyourself in aspiration to the divine.While the pentagram ritual certainly offers opportunities for enflaming yourselfin prayer, such as experiencing the awe of an encounter with an archangel, orthe feeling and visualization of the pentagram flaming about you and thehexagram at your heart, the Middle Pillar gives you an important new key: thevisualization of the Crown center as a sphere above your head. You can aspireforcefully to that center as a symbol of Kether—the light of your Holy GuardianAngel itself—thereby strengthening the muscles of aspiration to the most sublimeenergies of which you can conceive. The practice thus becomes a trueaspirational and devotional exercise, ideally performed daily, empoweringeverything else you do. Later, having trained yourself in this manner, you willbe able to use the Middle Pillar ritual within the structure of a larger workingas a general invocation, any time you need an influx of power to fuel yourritual (see Chapter 8).Also in Phase Three, I suggest that you begin various meditations on thesephiroth and the paths below Tiphereth. Refer to the material toward the end ofThe Book of Thoth for suggestive themes and phrases associated with the 22paths. The point here is to intensify your work with the correspondences, mostrelevant to the work ahead you as you ‘climb the Tree’ along these paths. Thebetter acquainted you are with the terrain, the more effective and empoweringyour exploration will be. Spend at least six months in Phase Three, and thenmove on to Phase Four.Phase FourHere, I suggest that you add the Lesser Ritual of the Hexagram (see Chapter 6).In many Golden Dawn-derived systems, the hexagram ritual is undertaken at theSecond Order level, after the initiate has symbolically traversed the sephirothand paths below Tiphereth. This is why I suggested in Phase Three that you focusyour meditations on these sephiroth and paths—so that you can bring a greatersense of meaning and relevance to the hexagram ritual when you actually beginpracticing it. Those of you who are working in a Golden Dawn-patterned order(such as the Temple of the Silver Star) will be at an advantage here; but ifnot, you can replicate that for yourself to some extent by aligning yourselfwith the sub-Tiphereth regions before moving on to work with the hexagramritual.You may wish to experiment with the ritual of the Star Sapphire as an alternateform of hexagram ritual, but remember that the Star Sapphire has no banishingform, and in my experience it brings in a much more exalted level of force thanthe ‘classic’ Lesser Ritual of the Hexagram. It should, therefore, be usedmindfully and judiciously when a more intense degree of magical force isrequired.Additional Recommended PracticesThe EucharistIn Magick in Theory and Practice, Cap. 20, Crowley writes:> > > Of the Eucharist and of the Art of Alchemy.

One approach is toextract a personal ‘ritual of two elements’ from Liber XV, the Gnostic Mass. Ifyou consider the structure of the Mass, it’s not hard to see how you might beable to turn this into a ritual you could use on your own, or perhaps with apartner. Start with Section VI, the consecration of the elements. With your wineand host handy, move through the procedures of consecrating the elements,invoking the divine force, locking it into the elements, combining them andconsuming them (see Sections VI-VIII).Much as in the Gnostic Mass itself, there is an opportunity here to usevisualization and other inner work to amplify the magical benefit of performingthis ceremony, or other similar personal rites. Hold in mind a specific magicalgoal throughout the ritual process: the building of intensity, the consecrationof the elements, the invocation of the force, and finally the climactic unitingof the elements, and their consumption. When you consume the eucharist, bemindful of the fact that you now embody the magical goal. You are like acomputer that is ready to be programmed with the right software. The softwarethat you have created is the mental form of the desired magical goal; it’s theprogram you are giving to your ‘new self’ to run. The more intensely and vividlyyou can visualize the desired outcome, the more effective it will be. Make it asvivid as possible in terms of the psychological realities of the desiredoutcome—the way you will feel and think about yourself, and the way your lifeitself will take shape when you have attained the outcome. The more you makethat goal ‘come alive’ within you, the more magical momentum you will bring tothe ritual.Mindfulness PracticesSome mindfulness practices appear in the core curriculum of A.·.A.·., such asLiber Jugorum, and Liber Resh (which is a mindfulness practice inasmuch as onemust remember to perform the four daily adorations). The practice of Will atmeals is another common example. Here, you are bringing your attention to thefact that the consumption of food fortifies your body for the performance of theGreat Work. This sort of mindfulness is hardly limited to mealtime—you canextend this concept to any task. Anything that you are doing during the day canand should be recognized as a contribution to the execution of your Great Workand your True Will. To take an everyday example: “It is my will to get into thecar and drive to work, so that I may earn money, so that I may have shelter andfree time in order to pursue the Great Work.” And so on.If, for any specific behavior, you find that you are having difficultyexplaining to yourself why the behavior is in service to your will, you may needto rethink your priorities and your time management in this regard! Naturally,not every individual behavior in your daily life will be experienced asimportant, willful and magical. However, to the extent that you can maintainmindfulness of your entire life as a structure within which you strive to attainthat universal goal of all who begin the path of the Great Work—the K & C of theHGA—you will cultivate an ability to feel will in action, even in the smallestchoices and behaviors.Another useful practice is to maintain mindfulness of yourself as a balancedmicrocosm, and one method of doing this is to strive to embody the pentagrameach day; that is, to live each day, to the extent possible, as a balancedexpression of the four elements and spirit. Make a daily diary entry where yourecord your success at living out each of the elements fully in your life. Youcan use a code to simplify this: S is spirit, F is fire, W is water, A is airand E is earth. At the end of each day, simply write those five letters and thena number from 1-10 to indicate how successfully you embodied that aspect ofself. I’m using the sephirothic attributions of the elements here, but you candefine them and arrange them however you like. For earth, how well did you takecare of your body that day? For air, how well did you attend to the aspects ofyour subconscious through dreams and awareness of intuitive impulses, andmonitoring of your psychological projections? For water, how well were youfunctioning intellectually? For fire, how did you do in terms of devotion toyour magical goals, and aspiration to the HGA? For spirit, how receptive wereyou to the light of spirit manifesting in your life? As with many suchself-monitoring practices, the mere act of watching these aspects of our liveswill tend to push us toward healthier choices and more balanced living in thisregard.Breath AwarenessVarious pranayama techniques may take on elements of mindfulness as well. Forexample, the simple process of breath awareness is very powerful when donemindfully and diligently. The practice called mahasatipatthana begins with asimple, silent, mantra-like observance as you breathe: “The breath is moving in;the breath is moving out.” With repeated practice, you will find that yourawareness has actually shifted; you realize that it is more accurate to say thatyou are aware of a sensation of the passage of air, and you adjust your mantraaccordingly, i e. “There is a sensation that the breath is moving in…” Withfurther practice you become aware that it is really a perception of a sensationthat the breath is moving in and out, then a tendency to perceive a sensation,and so on. The deeper purpose of this practice is to dis-identify with the egoas the center of consciousness, gradually refocusing your everyday experience onthe real center of who you are—the divine star within, the khabs. By backingaway, step-by-step, from the habitual ego-based center of consciousness, youbecome aware of entirely new vantage points from which to view your reality.General RecommendationsSo those are the four phrases of our ‘basic training.’ Now, let’s review somegeneral recommendations that will be broadly useful regardless of your stage oftraining. Firstly, rhythm and regularity is very important in daily work. AsI’ve noted elsewhere, rhythm is one of the natural languages of the unconscious.If you can begin to prove to your unconscious that you are committed to ‘tuningin’ to its language on a consistent basis each day, your whole spiritual systemwill tend to get into ‘sync.’ This is much more difficult if you’re doingpractices at random times, skipping days, and engaging in other similarly sloppybehaviors.Secondly, I suggest six days a week of practice, with vigilant diarizing. Takethe seventh day off. Don’t set yourself up for failure by setting unrealisticgoals at the beginning, such as doing four hours of ritual, seven days a week,and so on. That would be far too strenuous and unrealistic for a beginner. Planfor six days a week of practice, following the gradually building curriculumthat I’ve described here. That said, everybody is going to mess up and have dayswhere they simply don’t do anything. In such cases, it is far better to have adiary entry for that day that simply says, “I didn’t do my work today,” “I gotdistracted,” or “My pet goat ate my pantacle” rather than nothing at all. Don’tapologize for it or beat yourself up about it, but do record it!You might wish to review diaries from the Thelemic tradition to get an idea forwhat to include in your record-keeping. Some of the best include John St. John(Crowley), and A Master of the Temple (Frater Achad), as well as Jane Wolfe’sdiaries from the Abbey of Thelema in Cefalu, Sicily. All of these provideinteresting insights into the content, tone, and scope of a well-done magicaldiary.Thirdly, you may wish to consider keeping your diary electronically. There is,of course, great beauty in a nicely bound journal. On the other hand, anelectronic diary makes it much easier to search for certain passages andkeywords. There may be times when one might wish to retrieve and collate all thediary entries pertaining to a series of practices which spread outintermittently across many weeks or months. For example, some years ago Iundertook a series of scryings of the thirty Enochian Aethyrs and I wanted toextract those into a separate document. My electronic diary made quick work ofthis.Fourthly, I suggest that you make your diary entry as soon as possible afterconcluding your work, and preferably in the same space where the work occurred.You will surely retain more vivid details of your magical or meditative resultsif you record them immediately, before you’ve had a chance to go eat pizza, petthe cat, and talk to your roommate.Finally, and quite importantly, please remember (especially at this earlystage!) that fear is never helpful; nor is beating yourself up for what you didor didn’t do. Don’t be afraid to experiment—to learn from trial and error. Whenyou fall down, pick yourself back up and keep going. The only real failure isthe failure to persevere.Recommended Reading:Crowley, A.

In spite of its origins prior to the Aeon of Horus,Crowley recommended its performance twice a day, to the end of his life.Likewise, many teachers and magical orders include it in their basic curricula.What is the effect of the ritual? Ultimately, you will have to answer thatquestion for yourself through daily practice, taking careful note of otherfactors that may be influencing the effect of the ritual. That said, the effectsgenerally fall into a few basic categories. The LRP tends to clear the physical,psychological and magical ‘space’ of the magician. It is also an invocation ofthe four archangels traditionally attributed to the four elements and the fourquarters. Many people use the LRP as their daily ‘hygienic’ practice, as itincludes the cleansing effect of the banishing form of the ritual as well as theenergizing and sanctifying effect of the invoking form. In addition to thishygienic function, the banishing form is often used to prepare the temple forelemental invocations, or as a general banishing prior to other work (seeChapter 8 for more on ritual construction methods).It is important to note that while the LRP uses the ‘earth’ form of thepentagram, the purpose of the basic ritual is not specifically to banish orinvoke earth as an element. Rather, as noted above, it is used as a genericcleansing and space preparation. There would be differences in intention and insome performance details if you were doing a specific invocation or banishing ofearth (or any other specific element). The Greater Ritual of the Pentagram (seeLiber O) may also be adapted for such purposes. The Temple of the Silver Starhas its own distinctive method of approaching specific elemental invocations andbanishings, and other magical orders have constructed techniques along similarlines in the many years since this material was originally developed.As will be explained below, the version of the ritual presented here variesslightly from what you will find in Liber O or other published sources. As withmany rituals, begin by relaxing and regularizing the breath. When you are readyto begin the ritual, you should move to the center of the room where you mayhave an altar set up. On the altar should be, minimally, your magical implementof choice. This might be a Geburah-keyed dagger or sword, or any other dagger orwand; or you can simply use your finger as a ritual ‘implement.’The ritual begins with a set of gestures and words called the Qabalistic Cross:> > 1. Touching your forehead with your right forefinger, intone: ATAH.> > 2. Touching your heart, intone: AIWASS.> > 3. Touching your genitals, intone: MALKUTH.> > 4. Touching your right shoulder, intone: VE-GEBURAH.> > 5. Touching your left shoulder, intone: VE-GEDULAH.> > 6. Clasp your hands upon your breast, then intone: LE-OLAHM.> > AMEN.When you learn the name of your own HGA, you should replace ‘Aiwass’ with thatname. Some magicians have objected that since Aiwass was Crowley’s HGA, weshouldn’t use that name in our own practice. While that would be a reasonableobjection under most circumstances, keep in mind that Aiwass was not onlyCrowley’s HGA, but also the very intelligence that inaugurated the Aeon ofHorus. Accordingly, by intoning ‘Aiwass’ at the heart, you link yourself to theenergies of the Aeon itself.The key to the successful performance of the Qabalistic Cross is a quietintensity of vibration and energy flow at each of the body areas touched. Youshould feel the force moving with your hand as you physically move from point topoint. Each time you vibrate a word or phrase, you should feel the energyintensify at the point of the body where you are touching. Also, as with anysuch vibration, you should conceive that the word is echoing to the far reachesof the universe, and the universe itself is resonating in sympathy with yourwill. Each of the words should be vibrated on a full exhalation; that is, youtake a full inbreath and then on the exhalation the word is vibrated withapproximately equal time and emphasis on each letter of the word. The lastsyllable will sometimes be elongated slightly (see Liber O and the additionalaudio/visual resources for more on the vibration of divine names).After performing the Qabalistic Cross at the center of the temple, you then moveto the east and draw the first pentagram.THE PENTAGRAMS & THE DIVINE NAMESThe invoking form of the pentagram begins with a downward stroke starting at thetop point and moving toward the lower left point. The banishing form begins atthe lower left point with an upward stroke, moving toward the top point. Be sureto close each pentagram at its starting point.1. Facing east, trace the pentagram in the air in front of you. See thepentagram flaming in a bright blue-white light. Point your implement of choicetoward the center of the pentagram, and intone: YOD HEH VAV HEH.2. Extend your arm and turn south, drawing a connecting line of blue-white lightto the point that will be the center of the next pentagram. Facing south, drawthe pentagram, and intone: ADONAI.3. Repeat as above, moving to the west, and intone: EHEIEH.4. Repeat as above, moving to the north, and intone: ATAH GIBBOR LE-OLAHMADONAI.5 [index_split_045.html#filepos655130]5. Return to the east, completing the connecting line to the original pentagram,and thus sealing the circle.When drawing the pentagrams, I suggest that you aim for approximately hip levelfor the lower points, and shoulder level for the upper points (except the toppoint, which should be above the height of your head). This is probably one ofthe least awkward ways of tracing them, as the movements are naturally withinthe reach of your arm.THE INVOCATION OF THE ARCHANGELSFace east. Extend your arms to your sides so that your body forms a cross. Say:> > > Before me, RAPHÆL.> > > Behind me, GABRIEL.> > > On my right hand, MIKHÆL.> > > On my left hand, URIEL.6 [index_split_045.html#filepos655392]> > > For about me flames the Pentagram,> > > And in the Column shines the six-rayed star.The archangels are seen as huge, winged figures of great majesty, robed andarmed as follows: Raphael: Yellow robe with violet trim. Bears a sword or dagger. Gabriel: Bluerobe with orange trim. Bears a cup. Mikhael: Red robe with green trim. Bears awand. Uriel: Black robe with white trim. Bears a disk (pantacle).Repeat the formula of the Qabalistic Cross, which brings the ritual to a close.The invocation of the archangels is definitely one of those moments where youcan amplify the effect of the ritual through visualizations and other innerwork. With each of these archangels, you have an opportunity to emphasize thecorresponding element within your being. For example, when you invoke Raphael,you aren’t merely seeing a great archangel robed in yellow—you are experiencingthe element of air itself as it manifests in you. You might amplify this byfeeling a great cleansing wind from the east. Similarly, when you invoke Gabrielin the west, you could feel a wave of blue water purifying you; a consecratingfire from Michael in the south; and a preserving solidity and groundedness fromUriel in the north. Amplify, elaborate, or customize this part however you like.Your own experience will be your best teacher.As you say the words, “for about me flames the pentagram” visualize a largepentagram surrounding your body, affirming yourself as a perfected microcosm;but also understand and experience this point of the ritual to be a statement ofthe truth that the entirety of your earthbound experience—the material universeitself—is truly flaming around you like a pentagram. When you say, “and in thecolumn shines the six rayed star,” you might wish to visualize a hexagram at theheart, symbolizing the light of the HGA burning there—the true spiritual seed atyour very core.I recommend performance of the LRP twice daily in the early stages of magicalpractice—one invoking and one banishing. Since the invoking form can beenergizing enough to cause sleeplessness in some people, I suggest you tryinvoking in the morning and banishing in the evening. You can also experimentwith banishing and invoking on alternate days, or testing the effects of usingonly one or the other for several days in a row (if you try this, I suggest thatyou go no longer than three or four days without banishing, to ensure adequatemagical hygiene).If, on occasion, you need to be quiet when you do the ritual, it is acceptableto whisper, or to perform it completely silently. You may even find that suchvariations take on a unique, quiet intensity that differs in effect from afull-throated performance. Furthermore, you may experiment with astral (or atleast purely mental) performance, which will strengthen your ‘muscles’ ofvisualization and, in theory, your astral body’s ability to perform this ritualon its own plane.The deeper secrets of this ritual, many uniquely your own, will be revealed overthe months and years of your subsequent practice, as you integrate and harmonizethe ritual’s symbols with the inner landscape of your mind, body and spirit."},{"pageContent":"6 THE LESSER & GREATER RITUALS OF THE HEXAGRAMThe Lesser Ritual of the Hexagram (LRH) should be learned and used after theLesser Ritual of the Pentagram has been mastered and practiced regularly forsome time. The combination of the LRP and LRH is strongly recommended as a dailypractice suitable for maintaining the magical hygiene of the aspirant. As withthe pentagram ritual, some aspirants have found that use of the invoking form ofthe hexagram ritual at the end of the day can lead to sleeplessness. Therefore,I suggest using the invoking form earlier in the day and the banishing form inthe evening.The Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Hexagram (LBRH) is used to clear themagician’s aura and the temple of unwanted macrocosmic influence (that is, thoseforces pertaining to the sephiroth above Tiphereth), and to assert themagician’s lordship over these realms. Aside from its hygienic function, theLBRH would typically be used before invoking any specific planetary,sephirothic, or zodiacal force.The Lesser Invoking Ritual of the Hexagram (LIRH) can be used to invokemacrocosmic forces, and to create a magical working space that approximates theenergies of a Second Order Temple. Indeed, the LRH has traditionally beenpracticed by Second Order initiates of Golden Dawn-derived mystery schools.Unfortunately, it is partly for this reason that most published versions of theritual are incorrect. Published versions, including the one given by Crowley inLiber O, use the elemental attributions to the quarters that would have beenused only within second order Vault—that is, fire, water, air and earth,counterclockwise starting from the east. (You will note this arrangement ondepictions of the circular altar within the G.D. Vault, for example.) For mostdaily use, the elemental attributions are exactly as used in the LRP—air in theeast, fire in the south, water in the west, and earth in the north. The variousforms of the hexagrams given in published versions of the LRH are correct—theysimply need to be moved to the correct quarters when performing the ritualoutside the Vault.A note on pronunciation of “ARARITA”: The full phrase, which has now been openlypublished in several places, is ekhud rosh, ekhudotho rosh yekudotho, temurathoekhud. If you wish to intone this phrase in place of “ARARITA” you may do so. Atraditional method of intoning the full phrase is taught within the Second Orderof the Temple of the Silver Star.The so-called ‘Analysis of the Keyword’ presented in most published versions ofthe LRH relies on certain traditional formulæ that some Thelemic practitionersmay find unsuitable (i.e. formulæ which focus on the symbolism of the DyingGod). The Analysis given here is one possible Thelemic variant.7[index_split_045.html#filepos655555] Other distinctive versions of the Analysisare taught privately within the Second Order of the Temple of the Silver Starand elsewhere.Ritual Outline> > 1.

The Hexagrams areall drawn using the ‘earth’ form; that is, interlocking upward and downwardfacing triangles, as shown above. At each quarter you will draw the hexagram ina different pattern, depending on which planet or zodiacal region you wish toinvoke or banish (see Liber O). The unicursal hexagram may be used in place ofthe overly complex solar hexagram, if desired. Invoking hexagrams consist oftriangles drawn clockwise; banishing forms are drawn counterclockwise. Theunicursal hexagram, if used, is always drawn starting from the top point. Thesame form of the hexagram is drawn at each quarter.Draw the hexagram, then draw the planetary or zodiacal sigil in the center ofthe hexagram. Point to the center and vibrate the divine name of the planet orruling planet (in the case of the zodiacal region); then the archangel of theplanet (or ruling planet); then ARARITA. You may draw the figures in thespecific colors corresponding to the forces desired, to enhance the power of theritual.Some traditions recommend concluding this portion of the ritual by drawing afifth hexagram in the direction of the actual astronomical placement of theplanet or zodiacal region at the moment of the working. To do this you’ll needan accurate sidereal astrological chart or some other method of calculating theexact placement. There are a number of excellent software applications,including very useful mobile versions, for accomplishing this task.Close with the Analysis of the Keyword, as in the LRH."},{"pageContent":"7 LIBER RESH VEL HELIOSLiber Resh vel Helios, a Class D ritual of A.·.A.·., is one of the foundationalpractices of Thelemic magick. Along with the LRP and LRH, it will likely be oneof the core hygienic, devotional and consciousness-attuning practices you usedaily throughout your life. Daily performance of Liber Resh has a number ofmagical and psychological benefits. By identifying yourself with the sun in itsfour ‘stations’ throughout the day, you forge a conscious link to the energiesrepresented by the sun. Some assert that this manifests as a direct energeticeffect upon the initiate; others feel the benefit is primarily symbolic andpsychological—that is, we benefit from the symbolic alignment of ourconsciousness with the undying cycle of the sun, and the mindfulness of thisalignment throughout the day. I encourage you to experiment with the ritual andcome to your own conclusions. In addition to the benefits of mindfulness andmagical identification with the sun, you get regular practice in the assumptionof God-forms, fortifying the so-called “aura” with multiple instances of theSign of Silence (corresponding to Harpocrates), and a chance to build an overallsense of connection to the Thelemic current.It is common for A. A. initiates to begin working with this practice duringtheir Probationer phase, and several other Thelemic training systems assign oneor another version of the practice to their initiates in the early stages of thework. While the basic text of the ritual, as written by Crowley, has beenpublished and discussed in many places, there are a number of performancedetails taught in A.·.A.·. which seem appropriate to present here.Students often ask about the importance of the timing of the ritual throughoutthe day. As noted above, some teachers believe that the closer you are to theexact time of the station of the sun, the more effective the ritual will be.This may very well be true, but I encourage you not to let your attempts atperfect timing distract you from simply getting the ritual done. If you sleeppast dawn, as many of us often do, perform the Dawn adoration upon arising. Ifyou go to bed before midnight, do the Midnight adoration before retiring. If youmiss the exact time of a planned adoration, do the adoration whenever you catchthat you’ve missed it. Nevertheless, I suggest you do strive to be as exact aspossible with your timing. Consult the many websites which provide exact timesfor solar dawn, noon, etc. on any given day and location, and don’t forget totake into account the one-hour offset due to Daylight Savings Time.Another common question involves privacy during the ritual. What do you do ifyou’re in your cubicle at work and it’s time for an adoration? What if you’re ina meeting? Crowley clearly intended the ritual to be performed publicly orprivately, depending on where one is at the given hour. My stance on this issueis simple: it’s better to do it inwardly, via visualization and silentrecitation, or to do it later than planned, than to skip it. If you’re at workand you need privacy, excuse yourself to the restroom and do the adoration in astall, silently if need be. If you can’t excuse yourself from your desk or otherworkplace, do the ritual mentally and silently, visualizing yourself in theappropriate physical postures and God-forms. If nothing else, such situationsgive you valuable practice in the yoga of mental control, and a chance to getmore comfortable in the so-called astral body.The ritual begins by facing the appropriate quarter: east at dawn, south atnoon, west at dusk, and north at midnight. Imagine yourself to be standing atthe junction of the paths of peh and samekh on the Tree of Life. From thisvantage point, you will have the sephiroth of Tiphereth, Netzach, Yesod, and Hodsurrounding you, in the east, south, west, and north, respectively. Positionyour physical body according to the corresponding A.·.A.·. grade signs. [Note:If you are an initiate of A.·.A.·., you may also simply give the sign of yourgrade at each quarter.] These are:Dawn: Osiris Slain (a stand-in for all of the so-called “L.V.X. Signs”corresponding to the Adeptus Minor grade of Tiphereth.)Noon: Thoum-aesh-neith (a sign of fire corresponding to the Philosophus grade ofNetzach)Dusk: Shu (a sign of air corresponding to the Zelator grade of Yesod)Midnight: Khephra (a sign of water corresponding to the Practicus grade of Hod)[images/00007.jpg]The Signs for Liber ReshNext, you visualize yourself in the appropriate God-form. The basic techniqueand God-forms to be used are as follows:> 1. For each God-form, drape your physical form with that of the visualized> forms described below. (Imagine that if you looked into a mirror, you would> not see your physical body, but only the God-form.)> 2. RA (Dawn): Humanoid male body in Egyptian garb. Hawk head. Red solar disk> above head. Uraeus serpent (a cobra’s head) rising at brow. Left foot placed> slightly forward. Left arm extended forward, bearing a Phoenix wand. Right> hand slightly forward, bearing a golden ankh.> 3. AHATHOOR (Noon): Humanoid female body in Egyptian garb. Cow head (or> female human head with cow horns). Red solar disk above head. Left foot placed> slightly forward. Left arm extended forward, bearing a Phoenix wand. Right> hand slightly forward, bearing a golden ankh.> 4. TUM (Dusk): Male human body in Egyptian garb. Stylized Egyptian beard.> Nemyss on head. Left foot placed slightly forward. Left arm extended forward,> bearing a Phoenix wand. Right hand slightly forward, bearing a golden ankh.> 5. KHEPHRA (Midnight): Full body of scarab beetle. Wings stretching outward> and curving upward. Front legs bent upward, bearing the disk of the sun.> 6. Maintain these God-forms only during the first “elemental” adoration of> the quarter. That is, drop the visualization before moving on to the “Unity”> Adoration.So, at this point, you are standing facing the appropriate quarter, with yourphysical body in your chosen grade sign, and an astral “overlay” of theappropriate God-form. You then recite the particular adoration which is keyed tothe time of day, as given in the text of Liber Resh itself, followed by the Signof Silence (the right forefinger touching the closed lips). I suggest you couplethe Sign of Silence with a visualization the God-form of Harpocrates, asdepicted the Aeon Atu of the Thoth tarot deck. As you perform the adoration,attempt to throw yourself into ecstatic spiritual communion with the forcesrepresented. For example, at dawn, you can feel yourself as a solar being,rising from slumber to begin consciously shedding light upon your worldthroughout the day; and at midnight, you can identify with that secret solarsource within, which is ever-burning even when unseen (as with the sun duringthe night). When giving the Sign of Silence, seek to strengthen and sharpen thevisualization of the energetic aura around the physical body. As with all suchmagical signs, repeated practice of this sign, with this particular intention,helps to make it a truly efficacious gesture, and not merely a ritual formality.Next, you are instructed to “perform the adoration that is taught thee by thySuperior.” The following adoration is one traditional form used in the beginningstages of A.·.A.·.. Additional material is added at a later stage.After performing the solar invocation and giving the Sign of Silence, stand inthe Sign of Osiris Risen, or the Shining Star (your arms crossed upon your uppertorso, right over left, fingertips touching the collarbones) recite thefollowing from Chapter III of The Book of the Law.> > > Unity uttermost showed!> > > > > I adore the might of Thy breath,> > > Supreme and terrible God,> > > > > Who makest the gods and death> > > To tremble before Thee:> > > > > I, I adore thee!> > > Appear on the throne of Ra!> > > Open the ways of the Khu!> > > Lighten the ways of the Ka!> > > > > The ways of the Khabs run through> > > To stir me or still me!> > > > > Aum! Let it fill me!10 [index_split_045.html#filepos656506]> > > The light is mine; its rays consume> > > > > Me: I have made a secret door> > > Into the House of Ra and Tum,> > > > > Of Khephra and of Ahathoor.> > > I am thy Theban, O Mentu,> > > > > The prophet Ankh-af-na-khonsu!> > > By Bes-na-Maut my breast I beat;> > > By wise Ta-Nech I weave my spell.> > > Show thy star-splendour, O Nuit!> > > > > Bid me within thine House to dwell,> > > O winged snake of light, Hadit!> > > > > Abide with me, Ra-Hoor-Khuit!Follow this, again, with the Sign of Silence.There are a few additional techniques that may enable you to maximize themagical benefits of this Adoration.First, recognize that in performing this Adoration you are paying homage to thatunity that is beyond the four separate manifestations of solar energy worshippedin the preliminary adorations of the quarters. Along with other potentialinterpretations, this symbolizes the spiritual unity of each initiate(Tiphereth) which lies beyond the apparent elemental divisions of thepsycho-spiritual being (Malkuth-earth, Yesod-air, Hod-water, Netzach-fire). Asit is written in The Book of the Law (I: 51): “There are four gates to onepalace…”Second, intone the “Aum!” in the last line of the second stanza fully, slowly,and forcefully. After finishing the line, take a deep breath, feeling the lightof the crown center flooding down into the aura. Having done this, you willlikely find that your recitation of the next line (“The light is mine…”) willreflect a true magical reality—an actual shift in available energy brought forthby virtue of your mindful performance of these ritual lines.Finally, as you deliver the final lines of the Adoration, visualize yourself asAnkh-af-na-khonsu within the Stele of Revealing, as follows: With the line,“Show thy star-splendour, O Nuit!” see the body of the star-goddess arched aboveyou; her feet in front of you and her hands behind. With the line, “Bid mewithin thine House to dwell, O winged snake of light, Hadit!” see the wingedglobe at the center-top of the scene. With the line, “Abide with me,Ra-Hoor-Khuit!” see the hawkheaded Lord seated upon the throne facing you. Atthe conclusion of these lines, pause for a moment to allow the entirety of thescene to “lock in” to your consciousness. By placing yourself in the midst ofthese powerful archetypes, you strengthen your link to the Thelemic currentitself.As instructed in the text of the liber, you may wish to follow the finalAdoration with a period of meditation. Many students take advantage of thisopportunity to accomplish whatever meditative tasks they happen to be working onat the time. No particular style or focus of meditation is required, however."},{"pageContent":"8 METHODS OF RITUAL CONSTRUCTIONThis chapter will give you a sense of the basic components of a well-constructedritual, using Crowley’s comments in Magick in Theory and Practice11[index_split_045.html#filepos656785] as the primary source material. Afterreading this chapter, you should be able to choose a ritual aim and assemble awell-designed and powerful ritual to achieve your goal. Naturally, like many ofthe things discussed in this book, repeated practice really does bring greaterstrength, clarity, focus, and efficacy to your work. Hopefully, you’ll beconstructing and executing rituals for the rest of your life, and getting betterat each step of the way.Before we talk about the components and stages of effective ritual, I want toreview the theory of magick itself, and consider the question: Why would youeven bother to do ritual at all? You are likely aware of Crowley’s definition ofmagick as “the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity withWill.” Consider also these further words from Liber Libræ:> 16. To obtain Magical Power, learn to control thought; admit only those ideas> that are in harmony with the end desired, and not every stray and> contradictory Idea that presents itself.> 17. Fixed thought is a means to an end. Therefore pay attention to the power> of silent thought and meditation. The material act is but the outward> expression of thy thought, and therefore hath it been said that “the thought> of foolishness is sin.” Thought is the commencement of action, and if a chance> thought can produce much effect, what cannot fixed thought do?12> [index_split_045.html#filepos656987]So, with these words in mind, let us first consider ritual as a technique offocusing attention. This perspective partially explains the importance of thetraining of the mind through raja yoga that is so prominent in the system ofA∴A∴ and elsewhere in Crowley’s body of work. When we ritualize ourintention—focusing our thought into word, and our word into deed—we create aform that is keyed to our ritual goal. It is a law of nature that force followsform. Force will only manifest where a suitable form exists to contain it. Ifyou build the physical components of an electrical circuit (i.e. a network ofconnected wires) and connect it to a power source, the power flows. If the formof the wires is not correct—that is, if it does not ‘invoke’ the desiredforce—that force will simply not manifest.Accordingly, we must set up our ritual to be a form that will invite a certainforce. The effectiveness with which we can do this will depend on our ability tofocus our attention and intention, via symbol, ritualized actions, and all ofthe other correspondences and associations we may have with a particular idea.These may take the form of incense, colors, magical implements, sigils andtalismans, and so on. Intelligent and practiced use of these ritual forms willcreate very precise changes in consciousness that match our ritual aim. Throughritual, we construct a psychological environment for building up theseassociations, and then we find a way to tap into the necessary ecstatic forcethat can charge that form. Here again is that union of thought, word, and deedwhich completes the ritual action.There are different types of ritual, of course. We have dramatic ritual, such asthe Rites of Eleusis, where the energetic effect of the ritual is accomplishedthrough the dramatic narrative, and the embodiment of the particular energies inthe characters and their interplay. We also have what I would call ‘unconsciousritual’ embedded in our culture, where we collectively engage in ritualizedbehaviors that tend to have a psychological or energetic effect. This includesconstructing and participating in the modern mythology embodied in films, musicand other cultural forms, as well as our collective celebration of variousholidays and their associated customs.What we’re going to focus on in this chapter, however, is the classicalceremonial approach to ritual. This is a fairly structured method that Crowleywould have learned in his early association with the Hermetic Order of theGolden Dawn, and which many magical orders have adopted and elaborated since thelate 19th century.Preliminary ConsiderationsThe first step is to take a look at the reason you’re doing the ritual. Exploreconscious or unconscious blockages to the success of the ritual. There may beego-based influences on the desired goal, including the dreaded ‘lust ofresult,’ that may interfere with the proper execution of the ritual. If you areambivalent about the outcome in some way, even unconsciously—if there’s any partof you that doesn’t actually want the ritual to succeed—you may find that itleeches power out of the ritual. No matter how perfectly you execute it, if yourmind’s working against you and against itself, you will be much less likely tosucceed.Next, take practical steps to achieve the aim. If you need to put out a fire,reach for a fire extinguisher before you invoke the fire elementals for aid! Ifyou want a job, put in some applications before doing a formal ritual. Thesepractical steps become a part of the overall ritual, when understood broadly.One way of understanding this process is to view it in terms of the Qabalistic‘Four Worlds’ (see Chapter 17 if you are unfamiliar with this conceptual model).What you’re doing here, in essence, is shaping your magical goals in the worldof Yetzirah (thought and word) through your conception of the ritual aim, andthen linking that goal to the world of Assiah (deed). And that deed, such asputting in the job applications, becomes a concrete magical link to the desiredgoal.Once you have decided to do the ritual, I recommend that you do a brief ceremonyor meditation to purify and consecrate your aim. You may recall that in LiberCL, Crowley defines purity as a state where ‘no alien element’ intrudes—thething is ‘purely’ itself. With purification of your intention, you’re simplywashing away any undesirable accretions to the central, pure aim of the Will.One of the ways you do this is through the process of looking forcounter-impulses and ambivalence about the outcome, as discussed above. Anotherapproach would be to undertake an exercise where you mentally visualize themagical aim as a symbolic object of your own devising, then see the object beingcleansed and made pure. The consecration of the ritual aim simply involvesbringing a sense of sacredness to it. Perform a meditation wherein you link theritual aim to your True Will, seeing it as an extension of the will of your HolyGuardian Angel, and a step in your path toward union with the HGA.Having completed these preliminaries, you are now ready to construct the formalritual. Choose the sephira or path on the Tree of Life that best matches yourritual aim, and look up the correspondences from 777 or other sources.13[index_split_045.html#filepos657212] These may include incenses, colors, sigils,deities associated with the goal, as well as the Qabalistic hierarchies of thedivine names, archangels, angels, and the ‘Palaces of Assiah,’ corresponding tothe Four Worlds, or any other correspondences you are moved to incorporate.Next, consider the timing of the ritual. Let’s say you’ve decided that Mars isan appropriate planet for the ritual intention. Consult your astronomicalreferences (or draw up a sidereal astrological chart) and choose a day and timewhen Mars is prominently placed in the heavens. For example, you might choose amoment when Mars is on the horizon; or you can simply choose a Tuesday—the dayof the week attributed to Mars. You can also base the precise timing of theritual on the traditional Tattva tides (see below), which are cycles of fivetwenty-four minute periods starting at sunrise, and corresponding to the fourelements and spirit. Our Mars ritual might be well-suited to the fire Tattva.Some people choose to use the traditional ‘magical hours’ where specific timesof the day that correspond to certain certain planets, magical goals, and so on;but I have found little use for these in my own magical work. Akasha Spirit Vayu Air Tejas Fire Apas Water Prithivi EarthLet’s review the overall structure of an effective ritual, and the buildingblocks that make it work. As I said earlier, Magick in Theory and Practice isour primary source material, but I’ve supplemented Crowley’s ideas withconclusions drawn from my own experience doing ritual, as well as that of thestudents I have supervised.Banishing, Purification and ConsecrationFirst, we have the banishing, purification, and consecration of the space, andof the consciousness of the magician. Some of the options for banishing arefairly obvious, such as the classic lesser rituals of the pentagram andhexagram, the Star Ruby, and the like. Alternatively, you can banish ‘by fiat,’where you simply declare that the temple is appropriately banished. There arealso traditional forms of banishing like clattering swords together, hittinggongs, widdershins circles, and so on. The purification and consecrationdiscussed here are slightly different from what I described above; here weritualize these steps with a purification of the space with water and aconsecration of the space with fire (typically incense). The underlying theoryis, however, the same: we cleanse the space of all extraneous influences, andthen imbue it with sacredness.General InvocationNext comes the General Invocation. I liken this to plugging a T.V. into the wallsocket and turning it on. Later, you’ll concern yourself with tuning to aparticular station, but for now you simply want to make sure it’s powered up.Accordingly, the general invocation should be powerful, but non-specific.Examples would be the preliminary invocation from the Goetia, also seen in adifferent form in Liber Samekh, the first Enochian call, some sort of middlepillar variation, the Nuit invocation from the Gnostic Mass, and so on. Anythingthat gets the power flowing for you is a good candidate.The Oath or ProclamationAfter the General Invocation, make the Oath or Proclamation; that is, state thepurpose of the rite. You have formulated the intention of the ritual (thought),and now you consciously formulate this intention via the word. It is a microcosmof the idea of the Logos and the effect of the Logos in the world; the word thatembodies the primal will-force and takes it out into the world. The Oath orProclamation could be as simple as a sentence or two, such as, “I am Frater orSoror so-and-so, and it is my will to create a talisman of Mars so that I mayobtain magical power to execute my True Will.” There is no need to be overlywordy, or to belabor the point.Specific InvocationAfter this, we move into the Specific Invocation. Here is where we tune thatT.V. to the particular channel we want to watch, and of course, this will be the‘channel’ that corresponds to the aim of our ritual and the symboliccorrespondences we have chosen. An excellent example of a specific invocation inpoetic form is Liber Israfel, which is designed to be an invocation of Tahuti.14[index_split_045.html#filepos657376] Other options for a specific invocationwould be the Greater Pentagram or Hexagram rituals of the particular element orplanet or zodiacal region you wish to invoke (see Chapters 5 and 6 for details).Bringing Down the Magical ForceNow that you have turned on the primary power with the General Invocation,declared the aim of the rite with the Oath or Proclamation, and performed therequisite Specific Invocations, you must find a way to bring the force down intomanifestation. As noted earlier, this process mirrors the doctrine of theQabalistic Four Worlds: You are attempting to bring an ineffable energy downthrough increasingly concrete levels of form, so that it can bring tangibleresults in your outer and inner life. There are a few neat tricks for doingthis, such as using the four color scales for visualizations as you bring theforce down, or ‘personifying’ interactions between the levels of the hierarchy.For example, if you’re using a certain Qabalistic hierarchy of divine names,archangels, angels, and so on, you can implore each ‘entity’ to send forth thenext, and use the color transitions to accentuate each successive level.At each stage, try to identify as fully as possible with the nature of theentity that you’re addressing. By the time you’re done you will have completedall the links in the chain, and brought the hierarchy down to a manifest level.This is one aspect of ritual construction where you can unleash your creativityand have some fun. For example, I was teaching a ritual design class a few yearsago, and our aim was to consecrate a Jupiter/Chesed talisman. Several of us hadconstructed a ritual with various specific invocations of Jupiter, including theappropriate Greater Hexagram ritual, but we didn’t stop there. The climax of theritual, and the final method of bringing down the force, was to draw a largeTree of Life on the floor, and then have all the ritual participants walk thepath of the ‘Lighting Flash’ on the Tree while chanting the hierarchy of divinenames, archangels, and angelic choir. We made several passes down the Tree,finally concluding in the West, where the talisman rested on an altarsymbolizing manifestation in Malkuth. We brought the energy down, and then allof us simultaneously projected the force onto the talisman using the Sign of theEnterer, sealing it with the name of Chesed according to the ‘Palaces ofAssiah,’ completing the magical link. Thus, the ritualized actions themselvesphysically embodied the descent of the magical force (an outline of this ritualis given at the end of this chapter).The Completion of the Magical LinkThe next phase of the ritual, and a very important one at that, is to find a wayto lock in the force invoked, to ensure its effective action on the desiredplane. One of the most common ways of doing this is to consecrate a talisman (asin the above example) or to consecrate a eucharist of some kind. Common choicesfor a eucharist might be some sort of food corresponding to the invoked force, aCake of Light and goblet of wine, and any number of other options (see Chapter 4for more details). In the case of a talisman, you can then carry that talismanwith you as an embodiment of the force; with a eucharist, you lock the forceinto the physical substance and then consume it, taking the force directly intoyour body. “…[F]orasmuch as meat and drink are transmuted in us daily intospiritual substance, I believe in the Miracle of the Mass.”15[index_split_045.html#filepos657609]Once you’ve charged the magical link, you want to take great care to protect itso it will retain its charge. In the case of a eucharist, this means that youremain very mindful of the magical aim, and that you are taking the force intoyourself as you consume it. In the case of a talisman, the tradition is to wrapit in silk as soon as it has been charged, and before the invoked force has beenbanished from the temple. Otherwise, you risk banishing the charge right backout of the talisman you have so painstakingly created!Closing and License to DepartBefore closing the temple, you must banish any specific forces invoked.Generally, this would be the complementary banishing form of whatever pentagramor hexagram rituals were done, but a banishing by fiat is another option. Someversion of the classic ‘license to depart’ works well here, e.g., “In the nameof Heru-Ra-Ha, I now set free any spirits which may have been imprisoned by thisceremony. Depart ye in peace unto your abodes and habitations, harm none in yourgoing, be there peace between us, and be ye ready to come when called.” Once thetemple has been ceremonially closed, and preferably before you do anythingelse—even before you leave the room—enter the results of the ritual into yourmagical diary.I know this chapter has been something of a whirlwind tour, but I think you willfind the material here is a useful framework that you can expand infinitely asyou grow in experience. Continued experimentation will teach you which optionsand approaches work best for you, and in the process you will have become a muchmore powerful magician.Following are several examples of simple rituals exemplifying the structureoutlined in this chapter. I have chosen to include three fairly similarrituals—all of them talisman consecrations—to make it easier to see how thebasic structure can be adapted for various ritual goals, e.g., using differentcorrespondences and divine and angelic hierarchies. Note how the variouscomponents of the overall ritual framework can be interchanged (using poeticinvocations vs. specific pentagram or hexagram rituals, etc.) and how identicalformulae, such as the tenfold sephirothic invocations, can be used in differentways.All capitalized divine names, etc., are vibrated, not merely spoken (refer tothe audio-visual resources for examples of the vibration of divine names).Sample RitualsA Ritual of ChesedThe Temple is empty except for a black double-cube altar in the East(Kether-of-Chesed), draped in blue cloth. The paths and sephiroth of the FlamingSword, descending from the altar, are marked in tape on the floor. Lights aredim. Hand drums are placed wherever the drummer(s) will be seated. In theextreme west (Malkuth-of-Chesed) is a smaller altar on which are placedindividual items for consecration, and a black silk cloth large enough to coverthe entire top surface of the altar. Chairs for attendees line the north andsouth walls.The Altar in the East: Cup of water, censer, incense and charcoal, singlelighted white taper; talisman with sigils created from the Kamea of Jupiter; TheBook of the Law.Incense: Cedar or other resinous woodThe officiants and attendees are dressed in white robes with blue sashes orsimilar color charges; or, a base of black or white street clothes with blue asthe primary additional color; or, the violet robe of an Adeptus Exemptus may beworn, as corresponding to Chesed. Otherwise, plain black or white clothing isacceptable.The officiants are seated in a circle of chairs surrounding the altar. Otherattendees sit outside this circle, as convenient.PreliminariesMagus: Lead attendees in Rhythmic Breathing for approximately 5 minutes, forrelaxation and centering.Banishings, Purification and ConsecrationOfficiant 2: Perform the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram. Return tochair and sit.Officiant 3: Perform the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Hexagram. Return tochair and sit.Officiant 4: Move to altar, take up cup, and turning in place, sprinkle water toeast, south, west, north in sequence. With each sprinkle, visualize a wave ofpurifying water spreading out to the quarter. Finish by saying, “The Temple isPurified.” Replace cup on altar, return to chair, and sit.Officiant 5: Move to altar, take up censer, and turning in place, cense to east,south, west, north in sequence. With each censing, visualize a wall ofconsecrating fire spreading out to the quarter. Finish by saying, “The Temple isConsecrated.” Replace censer on altar, return to chair, and sit.General InvocationALL remain seated.Magus: Move to altar. Perform the Priest’s portion of the Anthem from Liber XV,beginning with “Thou who art I, beyond all I am…” and concluding with “…in thyChild.”Statement of PurposeMagus: (Still at altar.) Say: “In the name of HERU-RA-HA, Lord of the Universe,I declare that it is our purpose to invoke the powers and beings of Chesed, sothat all present may find prosperity and ease of circumstances, for theperformance of their Great Work!”“The Temple is duly opened!” Knock on altar: **** (4)ALL: “So mote it be!”Magus: Return to chair and sit.Specific Invocations and Bringing Down the Magical ForceALL: All stand, move to form a line that begins near the altar, with Magus atthe front, and begin to chant as taught: EL, TZADKIEL, KHASMALIM, repeatedly.(Drums are played in rhythm with the chanting.)The line moves down the path of the Flaming Sword to Malkuth, and then circlesback clockwise to the Kether point. This may at times evolve into a gentledance, as desired.When Magus reaches the Kether point, the movement and chanting stop, and thepowers of Kether-of-Chesed are invoked:Magus: (elevates talisman) “May the One Source blaze brightly within thistalisman!”Repeat the chanting and movement down the Flaming Sword, circling back toKether. ALL formulate the intention of charging the talisman, which remainselevated, with the Kether-energy. This time, Magus stops at Chokmah for the nextinvocation:Magus: “May the Universal Will be this talisman’s Force!”The pattern is repeated for each of the remaining sephiroth. The invocations areas follows:Binah: “May the Great Mother enwomb this talisman with perfect Form!”Chesed: “May this talisman enjoy the bounty of Right Rulership!”Geburah: “May this talisman achieve its aim with Strength!”Tiphereth: “May Beauty flower in the lives of all who look upon this talisman!”Netzach: “May this talisman find Victory in its Desired Aim!”Hod: “May this talisman be a perfect receptacle of its Higher Form!”Yesod: “May this talisman stand on the stable Foundation of its Purpose!”Malkuth: “May all its Force find perfect Form, as this talisman manifests itsKingdom!”The Completion of the Magical Link(Charging the Talisman and other items)After the Malkuth invocation, the chanting begins but instead of moving back tothe east, the participants fan out to have a clear view of the Malkuth altar. OnMagus’ signal, ALL turn to face the Malkuth altar, and give the Sign of theEnterer toward the altar, feeling the accumulated energy flowing from thefingertips and charging the talisman and other items, while vibrating together:TZEDEQ. Retire in the Sign of Silence, the right forefinger to the lips. Remainstanding in place.Magus: Holding hands over talisman and other items, performs the final sealingwith appropriate names. Knock *** ***** *** (3-5-3) The talisman and other itemsare covered with the black cloth.ALL: Sit peacefully and silently in the invoked atmosphere. All spend 5-10minutes scrying the astral atmosphere of the Temple, using whatever techniquesthey may choose (any such techniques should be accomplished silently, andwithout any movements that would distract other attendees). Magus signalsquietly to bring the scrying to a close, when appropriate.Banishing Specific Invoked EnergiesALL circle counter-clockwise around temple, three times, while chantingHERU-RA-HA, with the intention of banishing the invoked energies of Chesed keptfirmly in mind. Drums are played with the rhythm of the chanting.License to DepartMagus: In the Name of HERU-RA-HA, I now set free any spirits imprisoned by thisceremony. Depart ye in peace unto your abodes and habitations. Be there peacebetween us, and be ye ready to come when called. May the blessings of EL be uponyou. Knock * (1)A Ritual of KetherThe Temple is empty except for a white double-cube altar in the east (Kether).Chairs for attendees line the north and south walls.

Asana is posture, and pranayama is breath control. When we saybreath control in this context, there’s an implicit understanding that we’realso speaking of control of the subtle energy residing in the breath and in thebody. As we’ll see, working with the breath through pranayama is a potent methodof getting the kundalini—an integral part of our progress toward K & C of theHGA. I’m going to give you some useful tips, but for both asana and pranayamathere really is no substitute for in-person supervision.Within the A∴A∴, the aspirant will likely be experimenting with both asana andpranayama in the Probationer grade. However, there is no formal testing on theseuntil a good bit later, in the grade of Zelator. For the test on asana, you haveto be able to sit completely still in your chosen posture for a full hour. Forpranayama, you must reach the second of the four stages described in the ShivaSamhita, which is called either ‘trembling of the body,’ or as Crowley sometimesrefers to it, ‘automatic rigidity.’ This then gives way to a ‘spasmodictrembling.’ There are two core references in the Thelemic corpus that you’llwant to use for both of these practices, Liber E and Liber RV vel Spiritus.You’ll also find a good deal of additional information in Eight Lectures onYoga.16 [index_split_045.html#filepos657742]AsanaWithin the A∴A∴ system, the purpose of asana is not to require the aspirant tomaster dozens of pretzel shapes. Rather, the aim is to find a posture that willallow you to sit still long enough to ignore your body. Until you can ignoreyour body, your mind will not be stilled; and until your mind is stilled youwill not be able to master the more advanced meditation practices that arerequired to advance through later grades.It is a very good idea to experiment with the different postures given in LiberE and elsewhere. Spend some considerable time with them. Note the differences inyour results depending on which posture you choose. You’re definitely going tofind some postures that are more naturally suited to your body and, in contrastwith what some people advise, I really don’t think you need to purposely chooseone that’s difficult. Why frustrate yourself right from the start? You can beginwith postures that are inherently easier for you.No matter what posture you choose, you’re going to have to push yourself througha good bit of discomfort and spend a good bit of time practicing before youreally start to get results. This is much more likely to occur after you’veextended your practice sessions beyond the half-hour mark, and with a good dealof regularity—five or six practice sessions per week at least. Until you get tothat point, you’re not really going to feel that asana ‘lock in.’ You’ll know itwhen you feel it.Again, the main point is to be able to forget about the body so that it’s notattracting your attention. Discomfort is inevitable, but you should stop if youexperience extreme pain—especially if a particular posture involves an area ofexisting injury or weakness. In such a case, that may not be the best posturefor you. If you have bad knees or ankles, for example, the Dragon posture is notlikely to be your best choice.If you choose the God posture, one tip is to make sure that the chair heightallows you to have your legs more or less at a right angle so that your upperlegs are parallel to the floor. This will help you in a number of ways—it willreduce trembling in the legs, and it is also less likely to cut off circulationjust behind your knees.Of course, one of the underlying principles behind doing an asana practice isnot only the stillness of the body but the forging of the self-disciplinenecessary for later practices, including simply sitting down and committing todoing it for a certain amount of time, and keeping regular with it in day-to-daypractice. Crowley’s general advice about meditation vigilance applies here: It’sfar better to decide you’re going to meditate for 20 minutes and to spend those20 minutes in horrible distracted meditation than to have 19 minutes of greatmeditation and then stop a minute early!So, push through. Stick with it. Practice regularly. Don’t be frustrated if ittakes you quite a while to build up the length of time you’re spending in theposture. Eventually, you’ll get to that place where it locks in, and that willbe a real milestone in your progress. After you break through that particularbarrier, it tends to become much easier.PranayamaThere are two core instructions here, as mentioned above. Liber E is basicinstruction in pranayama, and when you achieve some mastery of Liber E you moveto Liber RV for more advanced practices. While Liber RV is indeed a moreadvanced text, it contains so much good information on the theory and practiceof pranayama, that I strongly suggest you read it carefully before you begineven the basic practices. It will help you form a more sturdy foundation for allyour work.Consult your doctor if you have any medical condition that affects the lungs, orif you have any doubts at all about the safety of these techniques. Thesepractices are not generally dangerous unless they’re performedimproperly—usually by overstraining. We’ll go into more detail on that a bitlater.There are a number of important benefits to be gained by practice of pranayama.For one thing, you’re working to balance the energy channels in the body, theida and the pingala—the lunar and solar currents in the spine corresponding tothe two nostrils through which the breathing occurs. There are also generalhealth benefits to proper breathing, but more subtly you’re cultivating animproved ability to tolerate, contain, and direct magical force. In this case,we’re speaking of the kundalini force, the life power which is resident in eachof us. Through pranayama practices you forge a more stable and balanced energysystem in your body so that you will be better able to direct these forcesthrough magical ritual, willed intention, and in many other ways.The benchmarks for pranayama results described by Crowley and the Shiva Samhitaare in fact physically discernible Kundalini effects.17[index_split_045.html#filepos657929] The four stages of this process are:> > 1. Fine perspiration on the body> > 2. Automatic rigidity, which gives way into a spasmodic trembling.> > 3. ‘Jumping about like a frog’> > 4. So-called ‘Levitation’I’ll leave it to your experimentation to detect what these phases actuallyentail. Please don’t get so hung up on these traditional descriptions that youunduly front-load your experience with expectations. Proper practice and(ideally) competent supervision will teach you everything you need to know.The practice begins as described in Liber E, with timed in-breaths andout-breaths. Crowley describes progressive levels for this, starting withbreathing in for ten seconds through one nostril, out for twenty through theother nostril, back in for ten through that nostril, then back out for twentythrough the first nostril. I always begin my practices with an in-breath throughthe left nostril, just as an easy way to mark where I’m starting and finishing(refer to the audio-visual materials for a video demonstration).The photo captions in Liber RV are easily misconstrued. Crowley says thereshould be exertion, but it’s very important to note that this does not meanstraining. What is meant by exertion is that there is effort made to completelyexpel the air from the lungs and to completely fill the lungs on the inhalation;but the process itself is fairly serene and nearly silent, not noisy andraucous. The aim is smooth, regular breathing and fullness of in-breath andout-breath. You should never, ever feel short of breath. If you do, back down onyour breath-times, and stay there until you can truly do it comfortably for afull hour. Only then should you move on to the next level.The more advanced levels also include a period of holding of the breath betweenthe inhalation and the exhalation. This pause is called kumbakam. There is astillness and a silence during this pause that (with practice) potentiates someof the most advanced meditation results. Once again, I will leave it to yourexperimentation to show you what occurs in this place of stillness; but sufficeit to say, it is a very powerful part of the process.As you see in the old and grainy photos in Liber RV, the fingers, thumb, indexand middle finger are used to pinch the nostrils shut. Basically, you’re bracingyour index and middle fingers on your forehead and then using the thumb and thering finger to pinch alternating sides of the nose. Also, in the Liber RVillustrations, you’ll see that Crowley is digging in the elbows into the chestin order to expel the air, and leaning back, pulling the head back and expandingthe lungs during the inhalation. Again, this is a way of using the whole body topromote fullness of the breaths.You will want to time the in-breaths and out-breaths very precisely, and I findthe best method for this is to have a ticking clock nearby. Using this method,you don’t have to think about the pace of your counting or look repeatedly at asilent watch or clock. A metronome would work fine as well, as long as the soundisn’t too annoying.One thing you will not find in the published instructions is what to do whenyou’ve concluded the timed breathing, yet I have found that these moments canbring some of the most striking results of the whole practice. Let’s say you’vedone 20 or 30 minutes worth of cycles in one of and concluded with the lastexhalation through a single nostril. I suggest that you really savor that firstbreath in through both nostrils and spend the next five or ten minutes withgentle, easy, natural breathing. This can be a real ‘high’—having gone throughthe entire pranayama session, balancing the two energy channels in alternation,you’re now experiencing the effects of their conjoined action in an ecstatic andenergized state. You can accentuate this experience with visualizations, andother more advanced practices taught within A∴A∴, the Temple of the Silver Star,and elsewhere. Don’t miss the chance to relish the peace and stillness thismoment offers.One of the most common problems with the practice of pranayama, aside from thetendency to strain too much, is clogged nostrils. The traditional remedy forthis is the neti pot, which is used to cleanse the nostrils with salt water.Decongestant nasal sprays are another option. You shouldn’t use thesechronically, but if you’re having two or three stuffy days and you want to tryto do pranayama, these modern conveniences can be very helpful.One additional technique for combating stuffy-nose syndrome is to use the handthat is not being used to pinch the nostrils to hold open whichever nostrilyou’re breathing through. It’s rather awkward, but on those particularly stuffydays this may help get you through your practice session. On the other hand,there are going to be days when you’re simply too sick or stuffy to do thesepractices. Don’t beat yourself up about that, just pick a different sort ofpractice for that day, and return to pranayama when you’re able.As with most of the practices in the A∴A∴ curriculum, asana and pranayama aremeans to an end and not the end in themselves. Ultimately, success in thesepractices converges with the devotional exercises, the ritual magick, advancedmeditation, and other tools in the outer grades of A∴A∴ to lead the aspirantright to the threshold of K & C.Recommended Reading:Crowley, A.

We’ll also take a look at a few useful and importantvisualization practices relevant to the Thelemic practitioner—some from theformal A∴A∴ curriculum and some from other sources. Like many of the topicscovered in this book, meditation has a huge continuum of practice. In theearliest stages, it’s really basic; yet it’s also a practice that can carry onethrough to the highest levels of attainment.Typically, when we speak about meditation in the context of the curriculum ofA∴A∴, we’re likely to be referring to raja yoga-style meditation; but you’ll seefrom the discussion here that there are a lot of other options open to you. Somewithin the traditional A∴A∴ curriculum rely on Buddhist techniques, and some areentirely unique practices designed to potentiate certain transformationalprocesses in the system.In the system of A∴A∴, the Probationer is likely to do quite a bit ofexperimentation with dharana (concentration) as well as asana and pranayama. Inthe Neophyte and Zelator grades the aspirant works with the practices known asMMM and AAA (drawn from Liber HHH). Essentially, these are guided imageryexercises based on the initiatory formulæ of these grades. They are undertakenas a means of deepening the aspirant’s understanding of these formulæ, andaccelerating their action. The Practicus works with Liber Turris, which is apowerful but very challenging practice in control of thought.18[index_split_045.html#filepos658110] Liber Jugorum is a form of control overthought, word, and deed, spread out across several grades.19[index_split_045.html#filepos658335] The whole process is brought to a climax—asingle point of focus—at the Dominus Liminus grade. As stated on the DominusLiminus task paper, “He shall meditate on the diverse knowledge and power thathe has acquired and harmonize it perfectly.” In other words, the climax of allthe raja yoga that has gone before is the resultant one-pointed focus of themind. The Great Work becomes a living meditation, throughout the day-to-daylife, on the synthesis of the elemental grades and all that they representinside the aspirant at this stage of the path.The meditative aspects of raja yoga begin with the process of concentration,called dharana. When this is sustained successfully, we experience dhyana—theunion of subject and object, ego and non-ego, the observer and the observed. Inthe course of improving our ability to meditate, we also obtain more controlover the vacillations of the mind itself, and this is known as pratyahara.Finally, all these techniques may ultimately lead to the result we call samadhi,which is a transcendent state of consciousness beyond rational apprehension ordescription.Since basic practice begins with dharana, that’s what we’re going to focus onhere. It really is the bread and butter of daily practice and is likely to be sofor weeks or months before other more advanced results occur. Asana is oftenused as a preparation for dharana, as well as being practiced simultaneously. Asnoted in Chapter 9, one of the main purposes of asana is simply to attain skillin keeping the body still, thereby allowing the mind to ignore stimuli comingfrom the body. When we are not distracted by the body, we can put our focus onthe object of our meditation.It is useful to have some quantitative sense of how you’re doing, and that’s whymany teachers recommend that you count the inevitable ‘breaks’ of concentrationthat occur during your meditation. One of the easiest ways to do this is to useyour fingers. You count on one hand, and as soon as you hit five breaks on thathand, you put down one finger on the other hand, and continue. When you getanother five on the ‘singles’ hand, you put a second finger down on the ‘fives’hand, so you know you’ve had ten breaks. Obviously, you can count up totwenty-five breaks this way, which is usually plenty. If you get pasttwenty-five breaks, don’t bother continuing with the counting. Just put it downas a bad session and try to do better the next time.Generally speaking, you should begin each meditation session with a specifictime-goal in mind. You should train your mind and body to listen to yourconscious intention, and requiring them to shut up and be still for apre-determined period of time is a major step toward developing thisself-discipline. Later on, the goals shift toward more advanced results ofdhyana, pratyahara, and samadhi. Yet at this beginning stage, the crucial taskis to maintain vigilance and obey your own inner taskmaster—not letting yourmind or body intrude, interrupt or otherwise be an obstacle to your stated will.It is very important that your attitude during meditation is one of allowing,not forcing, the mind to be still; much as you can’t lie in bed and forceyourself to go to sleep. Initiation of sleep is not an active process, but apassive one, where you relax the mental control that keeps you vigilant andalert. Your attitude toward yourself during the practice should be gentle ratherthan punitive. It becomes yet another distraction from meditation if you’recursing at yourself for letting your mind wander—but your mind certainly willwander! When it happens, simply think of it as a cloud passing over the sun, andgently draw your attention back to the focus of your meditation.Holding Mental ImagesLet’s take one classic meditation technique as an example: holding a singleimage in your mind. Classically, you might choose one of the tattvas, such asthe red equilateral triangle (tejas). Soon after you begin, you will notice thatthe mind will play all sorts of tricks on you. The image will jump around,change color, assume ridiculous proportions, and engage in all sorts of othermischief. Again, when this happens, rather than mentally ‘clenching’ on it, orbeing upset about it, you should soften around it. Allow the shape-shifting,color-changing, or whatever it may be to pass, and simply reinforce the basicimage. Focus on the image for a set period of time, count your breaks, andrecord the other conditions of the experiment such as how much food you had inyour stomach, your level of fatigue, the physical conditions of your meditationroom, any psychological disturbances that might form your mental set going in tothe exercise, and so on.MantraAnother type of meditation you might wish to try is the use of a silent,rhythmic mantra. Choose a phrase or multi-syllabic word like “Ra-HoorKhuit” andrepeat it in a sustained, rhythmic and unbroken fashion, i.e. “Ra – Hoor –Khuit… Ra – Hoor – Khuit … Ra – Hoor – Khuit…,” and so on. Insert a pause ofapproximately the same length as each of the syllables, to establish aconsistent four-fold rhythm. Do this for the specified period of time, and countyour breaks. Any mantra will work, but you’ll probably want to choose somethingwith which you feel a certain personal resonance.Breath AwarenessThe practice of breath awareness is another good option for meditation. Thisreally can be as simple as focusing on your inhalations and exhalations, but Ifind it is more effective if you pair it with timed breaths. For example, youcould use the classic ‘fourfold breath’ technique described by IsraelRegardie—simply make each phase of the breath (in—pause—out—pause) of equallength. The key with this practice is not to make each phase too slow, otherwiseyou’ll find yourself straining for breath.An equally simple, but considerably more powerful, breathing-awareness techniqueis called mahasatipatthana. This practice involves observation of the passage ofthe breath while silently commenting on what is observed. It is not exactly amantra, in that it should not devolve into a rote rhythm; rather, it shouldremain an active observation. You begin by witnessing your breath, at a naturalrate and depth, and each time you breathe in, you say silently, “The breathmoves in.” As you breathe out, you say silently, “The breath moves out.”Interestingly, as you progress with this (likely over the course of many weeksof consistent practice) your results will typically show a progressivedis-identification with your ego. For example, you might go from simply saying,“The breath is moving in; the breath is moving out,” to noticing what you’reactually observing is that there is a sensation that the breath is moving in andout. Later, this may transform into an awareness that what you’re experiencingis merely a perception of a sensation of the cycles of the breath. This iscrucial: you change what you’re saying silently to yourself, based on whatyou’re actually noticing; and if you follow this to its conclusion you’ll get tosome very interesting places indeed. I don’t want to spoil it for you byfront-loading your experience, so try it yourself. See how you experience theego-disidentification, and what conclusions you draw from it after amplepractice.Even an advanced meditator will attest that it is quite difficult to get themind to cease conscious thought, but the practices found in Crowley’s LiberTurris, involve doing just this. Here are its core instructions:> > 0. This practice is very difficult. The student cannot hope for much> > success unless he have thoroughly mastered Asana, and obtained much definite> > success in the meditation-practices of Liber E and Liber HHH.> > On the other hand, any success in this practice is of an> > exceedingly high character, and the student is less liable to illusion and> > self-deception in this than in almost any other that We make known.> > 1. First Point. The student should first discover for himself the> > apparent position of the point in his brain where thoughts arise, if there> > be such a point.

Sixth and Last Point. Let the true Cause of All be unmasked and> > annihilated.> > 7. This is that which was spoken by wise men of old time concerning the> > destruction of the world by fire; yea, the destruction of the world by fire.> > 8. Let the Student remember that each Point represents a definite> > achievement of great difficulty.20 [index_split_045.html#filepos658561]There is much more of value to be found in this liber, but those are the basicinstructions. I encourage you to try these practices when you feel you areready.Visualization PracticesHere we’re talking about visualization in a different sense than describedabove. These practices are more active and complex—akin to modern ‘guidedimagery’ exercises.The curriculum of A∴A∴ is cleverly designed so that the Neophyte and the Zelatorundertake what are essentially self-guided imagery exercises based on theinitiatory formulæ of those grades. These exercises are found in Liber HHH,sections MMM and AAA, which correspond to the Neophyte and Zelator formulæ,respectively. I’ll give you a taste of the MMM exercise here, in case you wantto experiment with it. If you attempt this practice, I suggest you start byrecording yourself reading the instructions, as it would obviously bedistracting to try to take yourself through these visualizations while glancingat a book every few seconds. Eventually, you’ll want to memorize the whole setof instructions. It will undoubtedly require multiple trials to get optimalresults, and your own level of initiation will be one determinant of your levelof success.

All ofthese practices should begin with preparatory relaxation and rhythmic breathing.The Inner Teacher: Follow a path into a forest and see a figure approaching,which you conceive as the perfect inner teacher. You can think of this an aspectof the Holy Guardian Angel, a wise mentor, or anything else you like.Regardless, the key is that you have confidence in the wisdom which will beimparted to you. When the teacher approaches, ask for a symbol, a word, anaction, or other instruction, with full awareness that this instruction will beof particular use to you at your stage of the Great Work.The Inner Lover: Build in your mind and heart a sequence of visualizations ofall the forms of love you have experienced. Take yourself through a series ofvisualizations where you try to tap in as viscerally as possible to (forexample) the hug you once received from a friend or a parent, the embrace of alover, and so on—whatever forms of love you have ever known and can recalleasily. As you move through the sequence, build up the intensity and vividnessof the feelings of love, until your entire being is subsumed with this force.Feel your vast capacity for experiencing love and know that in actuality, youhave access to this powerhouse of force at all times, and you can generate itwith no other human intervention. You may wish to conceive that the source ofthis love is, ultimately, the HGA itself.The Inner Treasure: Conceive that you are going down into the recesses of yourmind—deep into the unconscious. Go down stairs or down an elevator—whatevervisual device works for you. There you discover an ancient chamber in whichthere is a treasure chest. You know that you will find three objects within. Youalso know that each of these objects, which may be familiar or unfamiliar toyou, will convey a specific teaching relevant to your present life situation. Itmight be a suggestion about how to overcome an obstacle; it might be somethingthat gives you insights into your particular stage of the Great Work. In anycase, you should mindfully reach into the chest and see which objects presentthemselves to you. Don’t try to decide in advance what you will find. Takecareful note of what they are, then (either within the meditation or after)consider what these symbols might mean to you. As always, record your results inthe magical diary.Recommended Reading:Crowley, A. (1991). Eight Lectures on Yoga. Phoenix, AZ: New FalconPublications.Crowley, A. (1992). Liber E. In I.

In the system of A∴A∴,the Neophyte is thoroughly tested in the mastery of the “Body of Light”,although he or she will likely have been experimenting with such things rightfrom the outset as a Probationer.

This distinction canbe understood in terms of the Tree of Life. As discussed earlier in this book,the Tree of Life is a symbolic representation not only of the process ofcreation of the material world but of the component parts of the humanpsycho-spiritual constitution. Accordingly, if you look at the way the Sephirothon the Tree successively manifest, it is evident that mind manifests beforebody. The collective spheres of the ruach form a template—a skeleton ofsorts—for the eventual manifestation of the physical body at Malkuth. Just asthe physical body of humans is built on this astral skeleton of energy, so isthe physical world based on a similar astral framework. The most dense layers ofthis are more properly called the etheric world; accordingly, the most denselayer of our energy body—short of the physical body itself—is the etheric body.The etheric body more closely resembles the actual physical form of the body,whereas the astral body resembles mind itself. It is more rarefied, and capableof taking on a wider diversity of forms, not just those which are more closelytied to the physical forms that are built upon it (as is the case with theetheric body).The reason I’m taking such pains to distinguish between the astral and ethericbodies is that there are distinctly different sets of practices involved inworking with them when you undertake astral or etheric projection. Whenetherically projecting, you’re going to be in a “body” that rather closelyresembles your physical body, and the landscape that you’re exploring will belike an energetic skeleton of your actual physical surroundings. An ethericprojection experience will give you the sensation of leaving your body andwalking around the room, the house, the neighborhood, and so on. An astralprojection experience, on the other hand, will take you to a landscape that iscompletely different from your physical surroundings, and quite possiblydifferent from any materially existing place whatsoever. Remember, this is therealm of mind itself—infinitely plastic, and able to shape itself into formsthat simply don’t exist in the physical world.Testing Entities and Confirming the PlaneLet’s look at a few techniques and tools, so you can begin (or refine) yourexperiments. There are a few general procedures you should always observe.Crowley emphasizes one particular point repeatedly in his writings on thistopic: the importance of testing all entities that you encounter. None of theseentities are going to be offended if you don’t believe them about who they areor what they say they’re trying to tell you. So test them, using signs orformulæ that you may know, such as saying, “Do what thou wilt shall be the wholeof the Law,” to which they should respond with “Love is the law, love underwill.” Or use A∴A∴ grade signs, such as the Sign of the Enterer with the Sign ofSilence as a response. You should ask any entities that appear for their names,and the spelling thereof. Check the gematria of the name, and the nature of thesurroundings that you find yourself in, using your knowledge of magicalcorrespondences (see 777) to be sure you have “arrived” in the proper plane. Forexample, if you’ve invoked Jupiter and yet you find yourself in some sort oflandscape that is full of orange-colored hermaphrodites, you may have taken aleft turn into Mercury. (The most likely cause of such occurrences is animproperly performed invocation, or residual extraneous energies from animproperly banished space.) If you detect an error, try to discover its sourceand start the experiment over from the beginning.Working MethodologyWhen preparing to undertake an astral or etheric projection, it is best if youare not too full of food, especially meat. Excessive fatigue is to be avoided aswell. If you are in the middle of projection and you find yourself feelingfatigued, either mentally or with (what will feel like) physical fatigue, it’sbest to end the session then, rather than straining yourself by persisting. Ialso suggest you avoid orgasmic release in the day or so leading up to yourprojection, as it appears the life energy which would otherwise be dischargedvia orgasm is a useful “fuel” for astral visions.Set aside a solid hour or so, when you won’t be disturbed; choose a quiet place,preferably the temple in which you are accustomed to working. Start with a basicbanishing—I suggest the LBRP or the Star Ruby for this purpose. For your firstexperiment, try etheric projection. Settle into a relaxed posture, do somerhythmic breathing for a few moments, and get as relaxed as you can. Then,imagine that you are exuding energy out the front of your physical body (someteachers suggest that you see this emerging from your manipura chakra as asilvery cord). Shape this externalized energy into a form that corresponds toyour physical body. You have now formed an etheric double. Next, try to transferyour consciousness into this etheric double, and begin looking around the roomyou’re in. Begin to see with those eyes, walk around the room, look at objects,go outside, walk around in your yard, and so on. Just explore the etheric worldand see what you come up with. If you want to test yourself on this ethericlevel of work, you could have a friend who is in a location that you’ve neverbeen to or don’t know very well. Etherically project to that place and see ifyou can then tell your friend about details that you wouldn’t have had knowledgeof otherwise. Your friend can then either confirm or deny the accuracy of yourdescription.Now, let’s talk about the tools and techniques of astral projection. It beginsmuch the same way. You’ve banished, you’re seated in a relaxed posture, and thenyou externalize the energy in front of you. Once again you shape it into adouble of yourself. I think you’ll find you get better results if you seeyourself robed in magical garments that correspond to your grade, or thespecific type of work you’re doing. For example, if you want to visit aparticular sephira on the Tree of Life, you might clothe yourself in the robe ofthe A∴A∴ grade that corresponds to that sephira. Once you’ve externalized theenergy, shaped it the way you want, and transferred your consciousness into theastral double, then (and here’s where the difference between etheric and astralwork comes into play), begin to rise straight upward in your astral body.The purpose of this technique is to trick the mind into letting go of its holdon the physical body using the imaginal device of physically rising higher. It’snot necessarily that your astral body is “going” anywhere, per se; it’s justthat you need some kind of device to shake up your perceptions. So rise straightup and keep going, higher and higher, until you find yourself in some sort oflandscape you can begin to explore. Once you’ve arrived at your desireddestination, it’s often useful to perform a LIRP and perhaps also a MiddlePillar ritual, to energize the astral body for the work that’s ahead. Next, callfor a guide and rigorously test it. Get a name, check the correspondences, testwith signs and words, and so on. And then explore the region as best you can.Once you’ve done all the exploration that you’re going to do, thank and dismissyour guide. You can then return to your body. Move your muscles around, andreally feel yourself solidly back in your body. You want to avoid so-calledastral bleeding, where all of your energy has not come back to the bodyproperly; so be sure that this is strongly visualized and that you feel fullyreunited with your physical body. You might wish to very mindfully give the Signof Silence, figuring yourself as Harpocrates in the egg. You may also wish to doanother LBRP after you’re back—just to be on the safe side, and to come out ofthe whole experience without any unwanted lingering influence of whateverspecific region you were exploring.TroubleshootingIf you get into trouble, such as feeling harassed or threatened by entities youencounter, try enlarging yourself into a huge towering God-form of Ra-Hoor-Khuitand powerfully send the entity away. Or you can draw a large banishing pentagramand project that toward the offending entity. Occasionally, you may go very deepinto a vision of some kind and have trouble finding your way ‘back’ to yourphysical body. One thing Crowley suggests in such circumstances is to envisionyourself in a giant chariot drawn by great steeds, and then command them to takeyou back to your body. This may sound a bit silly but it works. You willdoubtless develop other techniques for getting out of trouble as you gainexpertise, but these should get you started.Testing Your SuccessAs you will see in the chapter on the methods and tools of A∴A∴, the work of thepath of tav during the Neophyte grade of A∴A∴ involves the development ofcontrol of the astral body. The Superior will test the Neophyte using varioustechniques such as scrying a symbol that is unknown to the person being examinedbut well known to the examiner. The task is to see if they can detect the basicnature of the symbol through astral inspection. You can do this yourself if youhave a friend who is fairly magically adept, or at least knowledgeable enough topick a sigil or a symbol and grasp its basic meaning. They should pick a symbolwith which you are completely unfamiliar. They can then give you the symbol, andyou scry it by imagining it is inscribed on a large astral “door.” Projectthrough the door and see what you find. If you’ve done well, then what you findthere—the correspondences, the tone of the place, and any information given toyou by entities—will match the nature of the sigil, and your friend will be ableto confirm this. Another test is to have a friend who is a competent magicianinvoke specific forces into a room while you are not present; you can then go inand explore the space using the procedures I’ve described above.This chapter just scratches the surface of the many possible techniques youcould use to explore the astral and etheric worlds, but hopefully this will beenough to get you started, and perhaps stimulate you to experiment and see whatyou find. As with many other magical techniques, your persistent practice willbe well rewarded.Recommended Reading:Denning, M. & Phillips, O. (2010).

Then canst thou bearmore joy.” [II:70] One important tool for strengthening ourselves in accordancewith this injunction is the diligent performance of devotional practices in ourdaily magical work. This advice is not to be taken lightly—spiritual ecstasy canoverwhelm a weak or unbalanced vessel. It is crucial to train ourselves in agradual and progressive manner, and this chapter will review some of the toolsavailable for this course of work.The primary technique involved can be summarized in these words: “Invoke often.Enflame thyself in prayer.” While this may seem like obvious or underwhelmingadvice, I think what’s often missed is that it is this very devotion that fuelsmuch of the work of the First Order of A∴A∴ as we progress toward Knowledge andConversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. Liber Astarte23[index_split_045.html#filepos659219] is the primary instruction in such methods,and not surprisingly it appears on the syllabus of the Philosophus, the gradecorresponding to Netzach.As I referenced in Chapter 15, this flame of devotion, aspiration and desire isdirected, by virtue of the training in raja yoga in the A∴A∴, toward that onesingle aim of the First Order aspirant—the K&C. Without this training of themind, there are too many vectors of force shooting out in different directions.On the other hand, without the enflaming of the self through devotionalpractices, there is spiritual dryness—the mind may be focused and sharp, but theflame of aspiration is missing. The Hod and Netzach aspects of ourselves mustwork together in this endeavor, as we aim ourselves forcefully and preciselytowards Tiphereth and the HGA.Before we explore the more formal techniques given in Liber Astarte, let’s lookat a few simple daily practices you may find useful. The first is essentially amindfulness practice—an awareness of lovingly embracing the reality presented tous in each and every moment. This not only reminds us that every experience oflife is an aspect of Nuit, and as such, a perfect expression of the All; butalso it enables us, in that moment, to consciously identify with that star atour center, the khabs, rather than the human personality—the khu we have wovenabout it.The wisdom teaching here, which each of us must verify for ourselves throughexperience, is that it is only the personality level of our being that judges,rejects, or condemns the experiences of life. It is only that outer shell thatattempts to steer away from things that we deem to be offensive or repulsive,and toward those things that we find beautiful. There is indeed a deep impulsetoward beauty in the human soul that can guide us toward the HGA. However, wemust transcend the reflexive ego-level rejection of things that don’t fit ourprejudices and aesthetics, and the equally habitual and automatic acceptance ofthings that please our ego.The HGA has constructed the present reality to be the perfect opportunity foryour growth; to be exactly the lesson you need at any given moment, to hone youinto the perfect vessel for its indwelling. If you push away the reality rightin front of you, rejecting that aspect of Nuit manifesting in your life right atthat moment, it is like you are refusing to locate yourself on a map. How canyou proceed to enact your will and follow your path forward to a goal, if yourefuse to acknowledge your present location as a starting place? Embrace all theuniverse offers you in your daily life whether your ego likes it or not. Youwill thereby maximize your ability to move forward in accordance with will.Another useful daily practice is to maintain mindfulness of all aspects of lovewe encounter. As we’ll see with our review of Liber Astarte later in thischapter, each form of love we encounter—whether of a partner, a parent, afriend, a child, even a kind stranger—is a glimmer of the love of the HGA. Hereagain, this tap into the most enlightened aspects of ruach that are symbolizedby the sphere of Tiphereth, the center of the spiritually awakenedego-consciousness.Now, let’s take a look at some of the formal devotional practices available tous in the curriculum of A∴A∴. Liber Had and Liber NU are two practices Istrongly recommend. These are essentially tantric instructions in thecultivation of worship of the inner energetic polarities symbolized by these two‘deities.’ You identify with a particular viewpoint, either of Had or of Nu, andthen aspire to attain its opposite (and complement.) The methods used in theselibri have much to teach us about strengthening the muscles of devotion. You canread more about these practices in the chapter on sex magick.Another very important daily practice is Liber Resh. As discussed in Chapter 4,many people undertake this as a mindfulness practice—as a way of ‘tuning in’ tothe Thelemic current throughout the day—and certainly this is a generic benefitof Resh. Yet there are a few ways to deepen the devotional aspects of thispractice worth mentioning. At each quarter you are adoring one manifestation ofthe divine principle symbolized by the sun. Accordingly, you have an opportunityat each quarter to narrow your focus of worship onto one of these particularmanifestations—Ra at dawn, Ahathoor at noon, and so on. As with any invocationor adoration such as this, the more intensely you identify with the God-form,the more magical force will be available to you.The second part of each quarterly adoration in Liber Resh—the part that beginswith “Unity uttermost showed!”—is an opportunity to adore the single divineprinciple behind all of these multifaceted manifestations of the solarprinciple. We can conceive of this in several different ways. This might simplybe an adoration of the physical sun in the macrocosm; or we could adore thatsolar, generative, life-giving aspect of self within each of us; or we can takethis as an opportunity to adore our own HGA, symbolized by the sun.The only limit here is your own creativity and ‘right ingenium,’ as you developyour unique inner language of devotion. This is, in fact, the central purpose ofdevotional practice. Through experience, we cultivate a sense of the divine; asense of awe and reverence in our relationship to the divine; and we use that asa springboard for further attainment.Now let’s move on to our consideration of Liber Astarte. While it is formallyassigned to the Philosophus, even the Probationer is likely to experiment withit. In this practice, beautifully described by Crowley, you pick a deity—anydeity that appeals to you—and develop various methods of worship in order tostrengthen the ‘muscles’ of devotion. It is like a trial run, if you will, ofthe eventual K & C working. Crowley gives fairly detailed instructions ondeveloping invocations and other forms of worship, decorating the shrine of yourdeity, and so on. Importantly, he also encourages us to remember that this deityis really just one reflection of the divine. If we lose sight of this, we riskoverly identifying with a partial force, rather than the one spiritual star inour sight—the HGA.One of the key practices in Liber Astarte is the development of a sevenfoldadoration (seven being the number of Netzach) in honor of your chosen deity.Crowley describes how the seven parts of this adoration reflect seven aspects orvarieties of love, thus:> > > First, an Imprecation, as of a slave unto his Lord.> > > Second, an Oath, as of a vassal to his Liege.> > > Third, a Memorial, as of a child to his Parent.> > > Fourth, an Orison, as of a Priest unto his God.> > > Fifth, a Colloquy, as of a Brother with his Brother.> > > Sixth, a Conjuration, as to a Friend with his Friend.> > > Seventh, a Madrigal, as of a Lover to his Mistress.> > > And mark well that the first should be of awe, the second> > > of fealty, the third of dependence, the fourth of adoration,> > > the fifth of confidence, the sixth of comradeship, the> > > seventh of passion.As an example of how these instructions might translate into actual practice,let’s take a look at a few excerpts from Jane Wolfe’s working of Liber Astarte,which she began in November, 1933, at Agape Lodge of O.T.O. She chose thegoddess Hera—the wife of Zeus in Greek mythology—to be the focus of her work. AsCrowley recommends, there are seven stanzas in Wolfe’s invocation of Hera, eachof which corresponds to one of the seven aspects of love listed above. Here isthe second stanza, which represents “an Oath, as of a vassal to his Liege”:> > > Hera, Invincible, Sovereign Goddess!> > > To thee do I swear my fealty and allegiance.> > > Great Goddess of Power, Majesty, and Might!> > > To thee do I swear my fealty and allegiance.> > > Thou that wieldest the Thunderbolt and Lightning!> > > To thee do I swear my fealty and allegiance.> > > Thou that causest the Earth and All that dwell therein to> > > tremble> > > To thee do I swear my fealty and allegiance.> > > Great Mistress of the Wind and Storm!> > > Proud-Crested Sovereign Goddess!> > > To thee do I swear my fealty and allegiance.Contrast this with the sixth stanza of the adoration, which represents “aConjuration, as to a Friend with his Friend”:> > > Hera, Beloved Friend!> > > Chief Protectress of Woman!> > > Guardian of Childbirth and of Children!> > > Dispenser of Fertility and Abundance!> > > Lover of the Pomegranate and the Vine!> > > Regard me, a woman, walking in your midst.> > > I need Thy Guidance –> > > That my Mind may be open to the Influence of the> > > Highest;> > > That my Heart may be flooded with Love;> > > That my Soul may be purged of Selfishness;> > > That my Body may be Strong and Resilient,> > > My whole Being, Firm-Flexible!> > > For the Working of my Will!Finally, consider the seventh stanza of Wolfe’s adoration, “a Madrigal, as of aLover to his Mistress,” as well as the final climactic lines:> > > Hera, Mistress! Wife! Lover!> > > Thou Adored and Adoring!> > > Bend close to me, Thou Lover, that I may feel Thy Breath> > > upon my face!> > > Thy Dear, Delicious Perfumes in my nostrils!> > > At the Touch of Thy Body I am caught up in a Rapture of> > > Delight!> > > Thy Mouth swings me out over the world!> > > Heaven, Hell, and Starry Sky,> > > Time, Space, and Eternity,> > > Are all dissolved in Thy Blissful Embrace!> > > And Thy Being merged in mine carries me through Eons> > > of Time> > > Out, Out into the Great Sea of All-That-Is!> > > I stand among the Gods! I stand among the Gods!!> > > And I do my Will among the Living!!> > > > > Mistress! Wife! Beloved!> > > > > Thrice, Thrice, Thrice Beloved HERA!!!Each of these aspects of love conveys an instruction in the relationship to theHGA. That is, each and every form of love that we perceive and experience in ourlives is a foreshadowing of the love of the HGA—a hint or glimmer of thatrapturous union that awaits us. Crowley addresses this idea in Liber Astartewhen he says:> > > > > Thus do thou pass through all adventures of love, not omitting one;> > > > > and to each do thou conclude: How pale a reflection is this of my love> > > > > for this Deity! Yet from each shalt thou draw some knowledge of love,> > > > > some intimacy with love, that shall aid thee to perfect thy love. Thus> > > > > learn the humility of love from one, its obedience from another, its> > > > > intensity from a third, its purity from a fourth, its peace from yet a> > > > > fifth. So then thy love being made perfect, it shall be worthy of that> > > > > perfect love of His.No matter which specific practices you choose to undertake, I am sure you willfind that the devotional components of your magical work are a source of beautyand power. It is my hope that these pathways of love will, one day, lead you tothe embrace of your own Holy Guardian Angel.Recommended Reading:By Aleister Crowley:Crowley, A. (1992). Liber Astarte vel Berylii.

It must be your ritual, and itwill be customized exactly to reflect your inner state and your spiritual needs.All along the path toward full Knowledge and Conversation, you will be gatheringtools, rituals and all manner of inner, symbolic elements—very personalized, andvery unique to you. It may be difficult for the beginner to believe, but by thetime you’re ready for the climactic K & C working you will have a very good ideaof the necessary tools. These may be based on existing documents like LiberSamekh and Liber VIII, but these will be skeletons for you to clothe with flesh;they are unlikely to be verbatim instructions maximized for your personal use.24[index_split_045.html#filepos659445] Don’t slavishly adhere to anyone else’sinstructions in this, the most profoundly personal of all magical workings.I want to begin by suggesting that you carefully re-read Chapter 2 concerningthe Holy Guardian Angel. It is important to have a solid understanding of thenature of the HGA, and of the relationship between the aspirant and the HGA asit gradually develops across the First Order grades of A∴ A ∴, to get the mostout of this present discussion.Indeed, we must ‘invoke often,’ and ‘enflame ourselves in prayer.’ In the finalanalysis, this is almost the only essential element in terms of technique. It isthe central key of any approach to Knowledge and Conversation. Any invocation ofthe Light of your Angel—in whatever form that takes for you, repeated withever-intensifying love and aspiration, over a sufficient span of time—willlikely meet with success. Certainly, there will be phases of your work wherethis will involve a formal ritual, but not always. The key is the relentless,day-to-day, moment-to-moment focus on aspiration—earnestly invoking the HGA asyou may know how, and as you will be instructed.As you may have guessed from the title of this chapter, Liber Samekh will be themain focus of our discussion here. Not only is the ritual itself a work of art,but Crowley’s commentary on it, in particular the Scholion that accompanies it,is some of the most lucid, informative, and practical information about the realinner work of ritual magick you will find anywhere. He describes thevisualizations in detail, and explains how to throw yourself into each of thecomponent parts of the ritual. It is incredibly rich and well executed, and Istrongly recommend that you study Liber Samekh and the commentary thoroughly andrepeatedly throughout your magical career.Liber Samekh was originally composed by Crowley for the use of Frank Bennett(Frater Progradior) in his own invocation of the HGA. Accordingly, it is anexcellent example of Crowley’s approach to teaching others in this matter. Herewe can read some of Crowley’s most cogent discussion of the nature of the HGA,and the relationship between the HGA to the aspirant, packaged for a belovedstudent under his supervision.The ritual begins with an invocation adapted from the Preliminary Invocation ofthe Goetia. One of the most notable things about this invocation is the way thelanguage changes from the first few lines to the final passages. Initially, theHGA is addressed with ‘thee’ and ‘thou,’ suggesting that the aspirant is in adialogue with a relatively separate-feeling external entity. In contrast, thefinal passages make it clear that the desired goal of union with the HGA hasbeen attained; or at least, the aspirant’s full awakening to the reality of theAngel’s existence, and the beginnings of conscious and willed communion.There is an initial invocation to the Angel, and then the bulk of the ritual isa sequential but functionally simultaneous invoking of all four elements,climaxing with a crowning of all under the regency of spirit, the ‘fifthelement,’ or quintessence. That is, these are sequential invocations of thequarters, but the net effect when the ritual is completed is that you havesimultaneously invoked all four elements and crowned them with spirit.You will recall that the whole purpose of the First Order grades of A∴ A ∴ is tofashion oneself into a suitable vessel for the indwelling of the HGA.Accordingly, this ritual is a recapitulation—and a full and final integration—ofthe work the aspirant has already accomplished in a preliminary form across thefirst order grades. Within the ritual, the magician goes to each of the quarterssequentially, tracing invoking pentagrams and vibrating so-called ‘barbarousnames’ corresponding to the nature of that quarter. The real key of this stageof the ritual is to throw yourself as vividly and intensely as possible intoidentification with the element being invoked. This is an important generalrecommendation for any ritual, of course, but it is more important here thananywhere else I have encountered. Crowley discusses this in his commentaries inreference to the level of difficulty of the ritual. It can be quite challengingto maintain the concentration and intensity of focus that this ritual demands.You throw yourself into embodiment of the energies of each quarter as stronglyas you possibly can. When you come back to the center, you must attempt to dothe very same thing, but with the element of spirit–the aspiration to the HGAitself, and the cultivation of complete receptivity to its indwelling.The climax of this ritual is a perfect example of the utility of juxtaposingenergetic opposites in order to amplify the effect of a ritual. There is aninfinite, upward, active extension of self followed a infinite, inwardcontraction. Crowley says this is almost like ‘hiding’ from the Angel within theinnermost ‘citadel of self.’ The alternation of the magician’s identificationwith these opposites vaults the self beyond them into an entirely differentstate of consciousness. This is the climactic upward surge of the ‘sparks ofself’ that completes the ritual and affects a conscious communion with theAngel.In his beautiful yet quite practical commentary corresponding to section F ofthe ritual, Crowley writes:> > > > > The Adept now returns to the Tiphereth square of his Tau, and invokes> > > > > spirit, facing toward Boleskine, by the active Pentagrams, the sigil> > > > > called the Mark of the Beast, and the Signs of L.V.X.

Next, we must balance this withthe withdrawal of self, and the receptive phase of the climax. I will quote atlength from Crowley’s commentary here, because this material speaks to the verynature of the Angel itself, and the relationship between the adept and theAngel. In passages such as this, we can fully appreciate the value of Crowley’spoetic talents when applied to descriptions of this subtle inner work—thelanguage is truly transcendent. The following comments correspond to section Gof the ritual:> > > > > The Adept, though withdrawn, shall have maintained the Extension of> > > > > his Symbol.

That’s certainly a useful aspect of it (and animportant tool for further work) but you have to do something with thatknowledge. You have to find a way to express this ineffable experience inrational terms, so that your work in the world can be informed, enlivened andenriched by your experience. You go out into the world a changed person—a newlymade adept—armed with the truth attained through Knowledge and Conversation; butyou can’t do that with full effectiveness if you haven’t translated theineffable into the rationally expressible.Having reached the climax of this ritual and attained (at least momentarily)conscious communion with the Angel, the ritual proceeds to the closing, which iscalled the Attainment. As I noted earlier, the language is now of identity withthe Angel, as follows:> > > I am He! The Bornless Spirit! Having sight in the feet:> > > Strong, and the Immortal Fire!> > > I am He! The Truth!> > > I am He! Who hate that evil should be wrought in the World!> > > I am He, that lighteneth and thundereth!> > > I am He, from whom is the Shower of the Life of Earth!> > > I am He, whose mouth ever flameth!> > > I am He, the Begetter and Manifester unto the Light!> > > I am He, The Grace of the Worlds!> > > “The Heart Girt with a Serpent” is my name!Here is another very important practical consideration. It is clear from theinstructions that this ritual is to be performed in the Body of Light; that is,it is performed in the astral body of the magician rather than simply performedphysically as we might do in our routine daily rituals. In order to learn theritual, however, you’re almost certainly going to need to practice itphysically—actually moving to the quarters and following through theinstructions in terms of postures, pentagrams and so on. Once it has beenmastered physically, however, it is very important to perform it in the Body ofLight. In part, this is because the astral substance of self is intimatelyconnected with the language of symbol through which the Angel expresses itself;but also, the magical ‘muscles’ you build through repeated performance of thisritual in the Body of Light will be of great use to you in a broad array ofcontexts.Let’s review a few practical points in terms of constructing and implementing aformal retirement for Knowledge and Conversation. In classical sources onthis—such as the Abramelin materials—there is an expectation of almost completesolitude for months at a time, and a very specifically constructed temple inwhich to perform the working. One of Crowley’s great gifts to modern magicianswas an understanding that there needs to be a way to progress down the path ofattainment and still function in the modern world. Most of us don’t have theluxury of being independently wealthy, withdrawing from the world without havingto work for months, and buying Boleskine House! If you contemplate therequirements set forth in Liber Samekh and Liber VIII, it will be fairly simpleto hybridize these practices and integrate them into your daily routine—at leastfor a time—before moving into a full and formal retirement with an actualwithdrawal into solitude.Liber Samekh is designed to be performed over eleven months, whereas Liber VIIIis a ninety-one day working. Hybridizing these you might, for example, have apreparatory period of several weeks or months with gradually building intensityof performance. You might go from once a day, to twice a day, to four times aday, building up gradually week to week until finally at the climax you mightspend a week or more in complete retirement. With a bit of advance planning, itis quite feasible, even in today’s busy and complex world.When you get to the actual solitary retirement, it is extremely helpful to havean assistant who can bring food, handle outside emergencies, and be there torespond to any requests. Run out of candles? Your assistant is there to go fetchmore! I suggest, however, that you avoid even visual contact with thisassistant, in order to strictly maintain your focus on the work at hand.Communicate through written notes if necessary, and make arrangements forbathing, meals, and other necessities so that you and your assistant are neverin the same place at the same time.Naturally, a purpose-built temple is ideal for this, although few of us havethat luxury. Nevertheless, you may find it quite difficult to attempt aretirement within your normal living space, with your children running aroundjust outside a thin door. Accordingly, I urge you to find a separate dwellingplace of some kind—perhaps a retreat center, a secluded rental cabin, or even ahotel room. Don’t despair if you seem unable to find an ideal setting. Remember,Karl Germer attained Knowledge and Conversation while in a concentration camp,with nothing in the way of conventional magical tools or a temple, and armedonly with pure aspiration. So, while all of these trappings of the invocation ofthe Angel, and the elaborate preparations of the space and the materialscertainly enhance the work, they are ultimately merely tools. It is the innerwork that is crucial.If you persist in this work, invoking often and enflaming yourself in prayer tothe Angel; if you listen inwardly for the communication of the tools and theritual forms as you build toward the final working, you will succeed.Persistence is ninety-five percent of the work. I’ve never seen anyone persistin the system of A∴A∴ and not succeed. All the ‘failures’ I’ve witnessedinvolved aspirants who quit doing the work, one way or another. They stoppeddoing daily practices, gave up on the path, or succumbed to their egos anddidn’t follow the system as it is laid out. But not once have I ever seensomeone persist in the work and fail. Never doubt yourself in this regard.Persist, with intelligence, courage and devotion, and you will attain!"},{"pageContent":"14 SEXUAL MAGICK & SEXUAL MYSTICISMMany spiritual traditions across history have included esoteric instruction inthe use of sexuality as a sacrament—as a mode of forging a link with thedivine—and in the application of sexual force to magical aims. Variouswell-known tantric and Taoist traditions, for example, have featured theseapproaches, and within Thelema we have a diverse set of practices, instructions,and imagery to access in many of Crowley’s explanatory writings, and in our HolyBooks themselves. It is widely known that the O.T.O. teaches certain secrets ofsexual magick, but I will not be discussing any secrets of O.T.O. in thischapter. What I will be discussing are my observations of the general formulæ ofsexual magick and mysticism present in many traditions that I’ve studied,including (and of course, especially) Thelema. This is a vast subject and aswith many magical techniques you could spend a lifetime studying only this topicand not exhaust its possibilities. We’ll just scratch the surface in thischapter, but I think the discussion here will be useful as you pursue yourexperiments along these lines.The word tantra means “to weave” or “weaving.” The implication is that thetantric practices, the sexual magical and mystical practices under discussionhere involve a weaving together of the experience of divine ecstasy as it occursin and through human beings. Sexual magick and mysticism are about fully livingin the world, and in our bodies. This is so quintessentially Thelemic and sopleasantly post-Christian! Gone is the dualistic view of the body as a sinful orlesser aspect of our nature. Here in our Thelemic tantra, we are not onlyallowed but encouraged to live fully in our bodies and experience ecstasy asmanifestation of the divine, not as something separate from it.Sex magick is, first and foremost, magick. As such, it is founded on the samedefinitions and processes that we associate with any other magical technique.That is, sexual magick requires the use of the proper force, applied via asuitable medium, using the most efficacious techniques, to the desired end. Oneuseful definition of an effective magical operation is that magician “utters”the name of Tetragrammaton (yod heh vav heh) in all the Qabalistic Four Worldssimultaneously. The Four Worlds are, of course, Atziluth, Briah, Yetzirah andAssiah. Placed in the context of sexual working, we have yod—the primal forceitself, that universal generative power we can symbolize by the wand or thelance; and heh, the vessel for that power, the higher soul of the magician, thecup or the grail. These are the Atziluthic and Briatic levels, respectively, andthey are in a very real sense the force that fuels the operation. Next comesvav, the world of Yetzirah—the use of the mind to shape the force and thedesired goal, impressing the will upon the eventual talisman. Lastly, we havethe final heh, the world of Assiah, which is the talisman or eucharist intowhich we lock the power of all that has gone before in the operation.I mentioned above that Thelema is particularly well suited to tantric work, andyou don’t have to look far to find some strong evidence of this. The Book of theLaw, as understood via Crowley’s commentaries thereon, is full of valuableinstruction in sexual magick and mysticism, both in theory and in practice. Weare given a specific pantheon of Thelemic deities—the polarities of Nuit andHadit, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit as the result of their union. These deities are ripeand ready to use as living images of, and gateways into, the inner processes ofsexual magick and mysticism. For example, in Chapter One, we read about “theconsciousness of the continuity of existence,” and this passage evokes thataspect of the tantric experience in which we weave together all of the divineecstasy of the universe itself—the universe experiencing itself through ourecstasy—as Nuit says that her joy is to see our joy. This is just one of manyexamples. For additional examples and relevant discussion, I suggest you reviewCrowley’s commentaries on Chapter One, verses 12, 51, 52, and 63; Chapter Two,verses 26 and 70; and Chapter Three, verses 55-57. The language, theory andpractice of Thelemic tantra is hard-wired into our system, and has been rightfrom the very beginning. We don’t need to impose doctrines, dogmas, or divinenames from any other sources, including traditional tantric systems. We alreadyhave a vital and powerful set of tools within our own Thelemic pantheon.PrerequisitesLet’s take a look at a few important prerequisites to effective use of sexualmagick and mysticism techniques. First, you need to be able to control yourmind—to show some mastery of raja yoga. Second, you need to have cultivated theability to direct magical force using this mental control, in a precise manner.Third, you need an internally consistent symbol system that includes emotionallycharged avatars of the universal polarities which traditionally would have beencalled Shiva and Shakti. In Thelema, we have Hadit and Nuit, The Beast (orChaos) and Babalon, and so on. By “emotionally charged,” I mean that you need tohave a connection to the symbol sets such that you can effectively enflameyourself in ever-intensifying adoration and ecstasy as you strive to unite theseopposites. You have to be able to cultivate a powerful, passionate yearning—ofHadit for Nuit, and of Nuit for Hadit—to really connect these concepts to theirinner energetic counterparts; otherwise it’s a dry system, mere words on paper.Furthermore, you need to have thorough knowledge of your own sexual arousalpatterns, as is probably self-evident. With this knowledge, you can obtain acertainty, through vivid experience, of the truth that the divine and theecstatic are one. This gradual process is one of identifying sexual ecstasy withdivinity itself and, conversely, identifying divinity with ecstasy. Ecstasybecomes accessible as a general phenomenon, independent of what we previouslythought of as being merely “sexual.” So, almost in a Pavlovian fashion, yougradually, progressively, increasingly, have the inner experience that God isreally sexy and sex is truly holy! Eventually, these two ideas becomeinseparable. You find ecstasy in every phenomenon, as we are enjoined to do inThe Book of the Law. This opens up as a reality for you when fully living outyour will and fully engaging in life; you are in fact an active participant inthe process of the universe experiencing itself. To find this ecstasy ineveryday life is a real gift. And Thelemic sexual mysticism, as described here,opens us up to this treasure.Another helpful prerequisite is a magical relationship with a sex partner,including a shared symbol system. It should be self-evident from the discussionabove that the more the two partners are aligned in terms of the names andpowers that they associate with certain energies, and their corresponding innerexperiences, the more powerful the magick can be. Having an existing sexualrelationship with the sex magick partner is also beneficial since you will havewell-developed physical, emotional and sexual vocabulary. Finally, it is vitalto have good communication with your partner about all of these things—on themagical level, on the emotional level, and on the relationship level—because ifthere is tension between the partners on any of these levels you compromise theeffect of the working.Stages of Training: Purification, Consecration & InitiationTraining in the techniques of Thelemic sexual magick and mysticism can beusefully divided into three stages, which I will refer to as purification,consecration, and initiation. In the first phase of purification, you arecleansing your relationship to the sex-force itself—the sexual, generative,life-giving principle resident in all humans. In our culture, and many othercultures across recent centuries, there has been an immense amount of shame andguilt associated with sexuality. Even those of us who consider ourselvessexually liberated Thelemites may discover that we have some residual shame andguilt complexes that need to be rooted out. Accordingly, in order to fullycomprehend, experience, and express the divinity of the sexual force and thesexual impulse, we first need to wash away—to purify—those residual shards ofshame and guilt that may cling to us. One approach to such purification mightinvolve meditation sessions where you bring to mind all sorts of clearlypositive and pleasant-feeling aspects of the concept of generativity: growingplants, the sun, or images drawn from mythology that are, for you, vibrantlyalive, healthy and life-giving, with a tinge of the sexual intensity. Exampleswould be the deities Aphrodite, Pan or Priapus, and so on. Essentially, you arereprogramming those aspects of yourself that may have been unduly influenced bythe shame and guilt complexes instilled by sex-negative society. You arereprogramming your associations so that sexuality can be experienced vividly asa vital, positive force in all its aspects. The real definition of a pure thingis that it is only itself, and is not tainted with any extraneous elements. Andindeed, you want the sex-force to be purely itself so that you, the sexualmagician, can be in right relationship to it.The next phase of training involves the consecration of the sex-force to yourdesired goals. What you are actually training here is the ability to direct thesex-force to unite with specific ideas and/or entities. You’re training yourmind to harness the force that you have purified and direct it, under will, invery specific ways. One of the most fundamental (and strongly recommended)practices is that of devoting all of your ecstasy to Nuit; most specifically,devoting the ecstasy of orgasm to Nuit, seeing this as an offering to Her, andabiding in awareness that Her ecstasy is in yours. I have to say that over manyyears of practice, in myself and my students, I have found this to be one of themost powerful means available of strengthening and sharpening the will itself.You can consecrate your sex-force to other aims, of course, in much the same wayas you focus the mind on the goal of any other type of magical ceremony. Thepower of the sex-force can be directed to unite with any other idea that relatesto the goal of your operation. If you’re doing an Enochian working, for example,and you want to have a more vivid and vital experiencing of the entity thatyou’re invoking, you can devote the energy of sexual release to that aim. Thekey here is to “fall in love” with the object of the ritual, experience theentirety of the working as a courtship and romance, climaxing in ecstatic unionwith the very idea of the entity in question.Here are a few practical exercises which may be helpful as you navigate thepurification and consecration stages of your training. Begin by undertaking aseries of meditations in which you contemplate the generative forces in nature,or symbols suggestive of these forces, such a growing tree, the endless processof the evolution of the human species, DNA, the sun, the cosmic lingam and yoni,the lance and grail—whatever inspires you along these lines. Meditate on thesethemes until you have cultivated an ability to create a sacred atmospherethrough this imagery. When this is easily done, start bringing in sexualfeelings—remembrances of past sexual experiences and feelings. Make thesefeelings as vivid as possible, while remaining wholly in the sacred spacecreated by the contemplation of the previous ideas.Continue this practice regularly over several weeks or more. Through thisrepeated and gradually intensifying pairing of the sacred and the ecstatic, youwill come to an awareness of the fact that they are one and the same. It willseem almost as if the pleasure centers of the brain are being permanentlyaltered by flooding them with sacred imagery. When this is an experientialreality for you, and not merely a metaphysical idea, you are ready to move on tothe next stage: Live each day devoting all pleasure, all ecstasy, mostspecifically your sexual ecstasy, unto Babalon or Nuit. Do this regularly for afull month at least. Make these devotional offerings as intense and as frequentas possible. It may be helpful, during sexual climax or other ecstatic moments,to visualize a great grail into which you pour the golden liquid of yourecstasy. After several weeks of this practice, you may be ready to move to thenext stage of your training.The final phase is that of initiation—the full formula of sexual mysticism andmagick. Ideally, this work is accomplished by two magicians who have passedthrough the preliminary purification and consecration stages, therebymultiplying the force generated. When both partners are trained in this way,they are better able to accomplish the task in the world of Yetzirah; that is,using the mind to channel the force in the appropriate direction to theappropriate end. Since the physical components of the eucharist—the combinedsexual fluids—are designed by nature to carry forth Will in the form of the lifeof the species, the first matter of your working is ready-made to be a vessel ofwill-force. It is as if you are allowing your ‘old’ self to die, sending forththe will in the form of the desired ritual outcome. With the eventualconsumption of the eucharist, or its use as a consecratory agent for talismansor sigils, that willed outcome is ‘locked in’ as a template for a new life goingforward. You might even think of the magician as a computer receiving a newsoftware program on which to base its operation; the software, of course, is thewill of the ‘dead’ magician that has been impressed upon the Eucharist. You aremerely adding the imprint of the desired magical goal, and mastering thetechnology of doing this is the central task in this third phase that I’mcalling initiation. We’ll discuss this aspect of the training in more detaillater in the chapter.Thelemic Sexual MysticismIf you’ve been reading between the lines so far, I think you will not besurprised to hear me say that firm grounding in, and a real identification with,the power of Thelemic sexual mysticism is a prerequisite to fully empoweredThelemic sexual magick. That doesn’t mean it’s the only onramp to powerfulsexual magick, by any means, but you will be maximally effective in your use ofthe sex-force only if you have consciously connected with it’s inherentdivinity. It then becomes one of the most potent fuels for enflaming yourself inritual, whatever your ritual aim may be.The body of Thelemic writings left for us by Crowley has tremendouspotential—real inherent power—to tune us in to the vital and life-giving powerof our sexual force. If you spend a significant amount of time immersed inThelemic culture, and participate regularly in Thelemic rites such as theGnostic Mass and others, you will likely develop a deeply ingrained symbolicsystem ripe for use in sexual mysticism and magick. You will develop emotionaland energetic connections to the concepts of Nuit, Hadit and Ra-Hoor-Khuit, forexample; and to the will itself as an expression of Selfhood that flows throughthe sex-force and other channels. You will become “hard-wired” to link certainsymbols, phrases, images, and divine names to these intrapsychic experiences,and this brings true magical power.Let’s look at a few examples of the wonderful materials in the system of theA∴A∴, so you can get a feel for their utility in your work with Thelemic sexualmysticism. The first of these is section SSS from Liber HHH. This particularpractice is assigned to the Practicus of A∴A∴. It appears at this particularstage of training in A∴A∴ to build on the work with pranayama done in theZelator grade. Pranayama is a potent stimulator of kundalini. Here in thePracticus grade, the aspirant practices the techniques of SSS as an accelerationof that kundalini work. In SSS, Crowley places the images and energiesassociated with Nuit and Hadit at the opposite poles of the spine (thecorresponding concepts in traditional tantric approaches would be Shakti andShiva, respectively). He begins with a quote from Liber VII, Cap. I (vv. 36-40):> > > Thou art a beautiful thing, whiter than a woman in the column of this> > > vibration. I shoot up vertically like an arrow, and become that Above. But> > > it is death, and the flame of the pyre. Ascend in the flame of the pyre, O> > > my Soul! Thy God is like the cold emptiness of the utmost heaven, into> > > which thou radiatest thy little light.

It is> > essential that the spine be vertical.> > 1. In this practice the cavity of the brain is the Yoni; the spinal> > cord is the Lingam.> > 2.

These two concentrations and may be pushed to the point of Samadhi.> > Yet lose not control of the will; let not Samadhi be thy master herein.> > 7. Now then, being conscious both of the brain and the spine, and> > unconscious of all else, do thou imagine the hunger of the one for the> > other; the emptiness of the brain, the ache of the spine, even as the> > emptiness of space and the aimlessness of Matter.

Ultimately of course, the goal is Knowledge and Conversationof the Holy Guardian Angel, and the belovéd with whom we unite is this HGA; butthese exercises stoke the fires of the life-force itself, and aid us as westrengthen our ability to direct that force toward this spiritual goal.Liber NU is another instruction that may be quite useful in developing yoursexual mystical practice in the context of the Thelemic pantheon. While much ofthis instruction is not explicitly sexual, it serves to cultivate the necessarydevotional and emotional connections to the pantheon; and as discussed above,this is an important prerequisite to Thelemic tantra.

What follows are some useful techniques I’ve encountered in anumber of traditions, in the form of an outline of how a sexual magick ritualmight be carried out. This will be applicable to solo work as well as ritualswith a partner. As I said at the beginning of the chapter, much of what followsis based on principles that would be applicable to any effective magicalworking, whether sexual or otherwise.As with any magical working, the first step is to identify the goal of theritual. This process should include a thorough self-examination for anyconscious or unconscious factors that are running counter to the purpose of theworking. If you have some ambivalence about actually obtaining the result of theworking, it will compromise the effectiveness of ritual. Consider whether thepractical conditions are in place for the manifestation of the object of theworking; as with all magick, you need to get Malkuth in order first so that theconditions are amenable. As it is said: you must prepare the temple for theindwelling of the god. You might also want to perform a divination concerningthe conditions of the working and its probable outcome. Discuss any worries,resentments, or unstated emotional concerns between you and your partner. Getall this out on the table and out of the way before moving forward with theworking. In any magical operation, but particularly in sexual magick, intrusiveand distracting thoughts and emotions can divert the force from its intendedtarget.If you do decide to go forward with the working, undertake the usualpreparations. As with most rituals following the western ceremonial traditionyou may wish to write an invocation to the particular deity you have chosen tosymbolize the forces invoked, and select sigils, talismans, mantras, colors,incenses, and similar correspondences. As usual, 777 and the Thelemic Holy Booksare good references to consult in this regard.When you are ready to begin the ritual itself, spend a few minutes simplyrelaxing and connecting with your partner emotionally. This will help ensurethat any personal disconnection resulting from a busy day at work, not spendingmuch time together lately, and so on, is not an obstacle. Ritually bathe, donyour magical robes mindfully, and perform the standard temple banishings such asthe Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram or Hexagram, the Star Ruby, orothers as appropriate. The next step is the consecration of the temple, and theturning on of the power to the temple using general invocatory rituals or otherprocedures, such as the Anthem from the Mass, the first Enochian Call, the StarSapphire, pranayama, or the Middle Pillar exercise.Next, move on to specific invocations connected to the object of theworking—these could be ritualized or poetic—and then make a proclamation of thepurpose of the working. Having set all this in motion, and having all thingsarranged in terms of your sigils or talismans and the temple space itself, putout of your mind the idea that you’re doing a ritual and simply use allavailable erotic skills, whether solo or with a partner, to enflame yourself inthe act of love.Turn your attention to your chosen sigils, mantra, or other symbols in the room,to provide a simple mental focus on the aim of the ritual, without too muchintrusion of detail. This also allows you to keep a reasonable amount ofattention on your arousal patterns, and the sexual act itself, to keep thatparticular flame burning.You will find it most effective if you stay engaged in coitus for at least anhour or so, before moving toward climax. When you and your partner are ready,unleash the entire power of the ecstatic climax as if it were an offering to theobject of the ritual. If you have personified the object of a ritual in terms ofa deity, this might be experienced as if you were making love with the deitythemselves—as if you have held them as your belovéd throughout the ritual andthe climax is an offering to them. Complete the formal working with theconsumption of the elixir as a eucharist, or by using it to anoint sigils ortalismans. You then close the ritual space, including covering any talismans orsigils to protect their charge, and perform the final banishings. As always,record the results in your magical diary as soon as possible after theconclusion of the working.So, as you can see, there’s really nothing terribly different about thestructure of a sexual magick ritual compared to any other type of ritual thatuses the classical ceremonial design elements; but the fuel for the fire, theengine for enflaming the will and powering the invocations, and the resultingspiritual union with the desired goal are all accomplished by specificallysexual means. The practice of Thelemic sexual magick and mysticism is a powerfuland ecstatic path to attainment, and I strongly encourage you to explore italong the lines I have set forth in this chapter. I have great confidence thatyou will not resent being given this particular homework assignment!Recommended Reading:By Aleister Crowley:Crowley, A. (1996). The Law is for All.

This is certainly bydesign, as Crowley intended the methods and materials of A∴A∴ to be widelyaccessible and, in time, widely replicated. There is plenty of availablematerial concerning what the system is, yet it is rare to find cogent andpractical discussion of why and how the system works. Accordingly, it is my hopethat by the end of this chapter, you will have a better sense of why the tasks,tools and methods of A∴A∴ are arranged the way they are, why they unfold in acertain manner across the grades of A∴A∴ and how they lead you towards theKnowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel and beyond.[images/00020.jpg]The Grades of A∴A∴There is a specific technology here, to be sure, but it tends to be discussed interms of a grade-by-grade analysis, such as the way the tasks and the nature ofeach grade are attributed to the four elements, or the corresponding sephiroth.We’ll consider it from this perspective as well, but I want to get beyond thatapproach and shift the focus to the type of training that’s occurring along theway. I have broken down the system below Tiphereth into five training‘tracks’—essentially, five different types of tools that work together to bringyou to Knowledge and Conversation. These five training tracks unfoldconcurrently across the first order grades (Probationer through DominusLiminis). Let me briefly outline the five tracks, and then we’ll cycle throughand discuss them in more detail. Obviously, I cannot discuss every task assignedin A∴A∴ in this place. Rather, I will emphasize the key practices that exemplifythe five training tracks, and show how they complement each other in theunfolding path of the aspirant.> Track One: The development of magical skills and techniques.> Track Two: The training of the mind—to focus, to empty, to become and remain> receptive.> Track Three: The stimulation and activation of the chakras and the raising of> kundalini.> Track Four: Devotional practices.> Track Five: Balancing the psycho-magical constitution.Before we look at these in detail, it should be emphasized that everything inthe A∴A∴ system below Tiphereth—everything leading up to the5°=6[images/00025.jpg] grade of Adeptus Minor—is devoted solely to theaccomplishment of the K & C of the HGA. It is easy to lose sight of this, due tothe diverse nature of the tasks assigned, and the many traditions that are woventogether in the system. Furthermore, every aspirant has their own prejudices andpredispositions that lead to magical myopia. In any case, the whole point of thesystem is not to accumulate a grab bag of unrelated magical techniques, but tobecome fully yourself. You must attain the K & C of the HGA, that you maydiscover with certainty your True Will. Then, you must carry out that will withforce and precision.Track One is the development of magical skills and techniques. This track isactively worked from the very earliest stages of the A∴A∴—as early asProbationer.ProbationerThe Probationer is likely to be experimenting with a full spectrum of magicaltechniques, but by the time of the passage to Neophyte (assuming theProbationary year is successful) there will be even more specific emphasis onthe traditional magical tools. It’s a bit like learning an alphabet. You simplyhave to learn the basics, and let them form a foundation for everything you doafter. The focus here is on pentagram and hexagram ritual forms (Lesser,Greater, Supreme, and so on) as well as on developing competence with theresulting elemental, planetary and zodiacal invocatory and banishing rituals.NeophyteThe Neophyte is essentially formulating their own “astral atlas”, if you like.There may also be experimentation with the Enochian system (although this is notspecifically assigned until the Practicus Grade) as well as various Solomonicand Goetic techniques.What is essentially happening here, by design, is that much of the traditionalinstruction that would have occurred in the old Golden Dawn Second Order isbeing handed to the Neophyte right out of the gate, with only the preparation ofProbationer as a preliminary. These skills are drilled in from the verybeginning of the system—but why? This is the question I’m going to be asking ateach stage of the training. Why here? Why now? What’s the point of training thisparticular skill set?It may not be immediately obvious why the ability to correctly perform apentagram or hexagram ritual, or any of these other techniques, is necessarilyrelated to the path toward Knowledge and Conversation. Consider: if you can’tdesign a ritual to effectively invoke a fundamental aspect of nature, such as aparticular element or a particular planetary influence; if you can’t competentlydesign and execute a ritual such as this, and make yourself an adequate vesselfor the invocation and utilization of a particular force—how can you design theultimate ritual of invocation—that of your own HGA? The basics simply must bemastered. To be sure, learning any specific ritual form, such as a hexagramritual, is in itself of little consequence; but as a tool for developing yourcapacity to invoke, safely contain, and direct magical force, it is invaluable.The Neophyte is also trained and tested in the control of the Body of Light, andin the related techniques of scrying and so-called astral projection. TheNeophyte is tested by his or her Superior in these procedures, to ensure theNeophyte has developed adequate facility with the Body of Light in order tocompetently explore the astral realms. This skill is important because theability to speak the language of symbol, which is the natural language of theastral world—and of the subconscious mind—is directly related to the aspirant’sgrowing capacity to receive consciously the various communications from the HGA.While initially in the path of the aspirant these impulses will likely be moreor less subconscious—speaking through dreams and intuitive flashes of variouskinds—the more consciously one can speak and understand this language the closerone is to conscious communication with the Angel. After all, consciouscommunication with the Angel, at will, is more-or-less the very definition ofsuccessful K & C.PracticusThe Practicus moves on to work with divination. Why? How is the practice ofdivination at all connected to K & C? Keep in mind that divination is yetanother method of using the conscious mind to receive subtle impressions from aset of symbols, and if you can’t sit down with a set of universal symbols likethe Tarot or the I Ching and get something apprehensible and useful out of them,how can you possibly begin to tune into the very, very subtle impressions thatwill be coming to you, at this stage of training, from the HGA? How can youbuild the right sort of radar, with the necessary level of sensitivity, if youcan’t execute something as basic as a Tarot reading?PhilosophusThe Philosophus is tasked with mastering evocation and working with talismans.How is this leading towards K & C? Think about what evocation actually is at itscore: it is the ability to externalize magical force, particularized to aspecific form and type of energy of your choosing. For example, the evocation ofa particular spirit into a triangle requires the ability to tap into a specificenergy source, and to effectively use the correct spiritual “muscles” to bringit down into manifestation. Whether you see such an act as purely psychological,or as an interaction with an actual external entity, you still have to havemanifest something concrete in front of you; and by doing so you arestrengthening the muscles that will allow you to interact compellingly,vibrantly and effectively with the HGA when the time comes. I do not mean toimply that the nature of K & C will be exactly the same as that of conversingwith your average Goetic spirit; however, the muscles strengthened by perfectingthe skills of evocation will be directly applicable to the eventual K & Cworking.Similarly, the ability to create and consecrate powerful talismans is animportant preparation for K & C. What is the nature of a talisman? It is aphysical object imbued with a specific force as chosen by the magician. If youcan competently design and consecrate a talisman such that you can a channel aspecific force into a specific object, and that object can hold that power andcan be of use to you—this ability will be certainly be useful as you approach K& C. After all, what are you yourself, if not a talisman of the force of yourAngel? Your entire life, your very being, your physical body, indeed, everyongoing living process must be a talisman of the nature of your Angel. If youcan’t imbue a physical talisman with specific force as simple as, say, Mercury,how can you possibly make your entire being a conscious talisman of theinfluence of your Angel?Track Two is the training of the mind to focus, to empty, and to become andremain receptive.Here we have another set of tasks that’s very likely to be approached fromProbationer onward. While one can choose whatever practices one likes as aProbationer, it is very important to have some exposure to the basics of asana(postures) and dharana (concentration practices). Through these raja yogapractices, the aspirant is beginning to develop skill in stilling and focusingthe mind, and training it to become receptive to subtle impressions. Inaddition, through the use of reflective meditations and study of the Holy Books,the aspirant will strengthen his or her ability to gain deeper understanding ofimportant arcana of all sorts. Why is this important? Perhaps it is ratherself-evident that if you can’t get your mind to be quiet—if you can’t still theflurry of everyday thought and allow your mind to become receptive to subtleimpulses for something as simple as meditating on a line of text—if you can’thold your concentration on a red triangle for a few minutes—how can you possiblyget your mind to be still enough, and free enough from interior chatter, for theultimate “meditation” of the final K & C working?These raja yoga practices continue across the First Order grades, of course,climaxing with Dominus Liminis. For example, Liber Turris is assigned in thePracticus and Philosophus grades to strengthen the ability to destroy thoughtsat their source in the brain. Liber Yod, for the Dominus Liminis, serves astraining in bringing the entirety of the mind to a single point of focusedintensity. All of these practices, placed here just as the aspirant is “on thehome stretch” coming toward Tiphereth, are entirely consistent with the aim ofthe Dominus Liminis to harmonize all the work done in the Order so far; to aimwith one-pointedness to the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy GuardianAngel. If you can’t get your mind to focus without distraction on a singlepoint—if you can’t bring all of yourself, all that you have found yourself tobe, together as a single unified vector of magical force—you will likely havegreat difficulty moving efficiently toward K & C.Finally, we have the practices of Liber Jugorum, which develop the aspirant’scontrol of thought, word, and deed. The Practicus attempts to control speech;the Philosophus action, and the Dominus Liminis thought. Why? If you can’tcontrol your speech in simple everyday life, how can you compose and deliver themost perfect invocation for your Angel? If you can’t control action in youreveryday life, how can you control your action toward creating the perfectritual to invoke your Angel? If you can’t control thought in your everydaylife—if you can’t keep yourself away a certain kind of thought, or draw yourselftoward another kind—how can you, at that supreme moment of focus, direct allyour attention one pointedly to the HGA? The control practices of Liber Jugorumstrengthen many magical muscles necessary for ultimate success in the GreatWork.Track Three involves the stimulation and activation of the chakras, and theraising of kundalini—the divine, life-giving, regenerative force resident inevery human. Through various practices, this life force can be intensified, andapplied in specific, targeted ways to transformational processes in the body, inthe mind, and in the subtle energy centers with which we work.Many Probationers will be working with asana, and this practice is preliminaryto more advanced kundalini work. The formal testing on asana is not requireduntil the Zelator grade, where one must sit perfectly still in front of one’sSuperior for a full hour before being passed. When there is sufficient facilitywith asana, it is appropriate to begin working with pranayama—the control ofbreath. This also may start as early as Probationer, but formal testing does notoccur until Zelator. One of the important things to note about this testing ofpranayama is that the desired results (often described as “fine perspiration”and “automatic rigidity”) are in fact early signs of kundalini activity. Theseare just the beginning stages, but it is evident that even at the level ofZelator, work is being done to initiate the flow of kundalini, and concreteresults are beginning to manifest. In practice, these early results assist withthe growing awareness of ecstatic energy states in the mind/body apparatus, andwith the conscious direction of this energy to desired ends.This process is greatly amplified via the practices given in Section SSS ofLiber HHH, which is assigned to the Practicus of A∴A∴. This beautiful andpowerful practice—essentially an instruction in Thelemic tantra—involves theconscious movement of energy between the base of the spine and the brain. Theaspirant conceives of these opposite poles as being Nuit and Hadit, and buildsup a sort of “courtship” between them. After much extended practice, typicallyover the course of many days or longer, the aspirant brings the work to a climaxas these poles are at last allowed to unite in ecstasy. What is the utility ofthis practice in terms of our training? In addition to the considerable mysticalbenefits, any such practice where the aspirant becomes a conscious vessel ofmagical force, and learns to direct it in a targeted fashion, is trainingimportant magical muscles. Even magical ritual has this effect. While it mightnot be self-evident that any effective magical ceremony has kundalini-relatedeffects, however subtle, I have found that this is generally the case. Afterall, in such rituals, you are building yourself into a battery offorce—embodying it, controlling it, and directing it. And the nature of thisforce, broadly speaking, is identical with that which we are callingkundalini—the very essence of life-giving, creative energy. No matter how wemight particularize this force in a given ritual via additional procedures, westill have to plug into the source.As with the other training tracks, the process of raising the kundalini is offundamental importance in the A∴A∴ system. In a very real sense, the kundaliniis the fuel that potentiates all the transformations we undertake in thissystem. All of the willed transformations of self are given more power and morepotency by virtue of this energy being raised and applied in the intendedmanner. Additionally, and very importantly, the ecstasy that occurs when thesekundalini-related practices are brought to their conclusion is in itselftransformative, healing, and evolutionary; its nature is to potentiate thetransformation of the human into the more-than-human. The experience of this“divinized” ecstasy is so important in the path towards K & C that it can’t beoverstated. By the time we have completed this work in the First Order of A∴A∴our consciousness of the divine nature of our own ecstasy should be so acute andso vivid that the very idea of God—the idea of our HGA—is the is the sexiestthing we can imagine. Likewise, sex is perceived as inseparable from holiness—itis, in fact, true worship. These transformations of our basic conceptions andexperiences of self, life force, and sexuality as an embodiment of divine forceare pivotal in the progress towards K & C (see Chapter 14 for more on this).Track Four is the devotional practices—the bhakti yoga of the A∴A∴ system. Whilethis work is especially assigned to the Philosophus grade corresponding toNetzach, the aspiration, the devotion, the fire, the passion for the pathitself, and the progress toward union with the Angel are not new to theaspirant. Indeed, it is highly unlikely that an initiate would even progress tothe Philosophus grade at all, without having been fueled by intense devotion andaspiration all along. I’m sure if you reflect back to what first drew you to themagical path—what made it come alive for you—you can see that there was anelement of devotion and aspiration that was calling to you, no matter how youmight have experienced it at the time. All of the truth and beauty thatenraptures you, that unfolding mystery for which you continually reach, thatsiren song that calls you onward—all of these are simply one or another aspectof the Holy Guardian Angel active in your life and consciousness. When JosephCampbell says “follow your bliss,” he’s not kidding around. This is a process ofdiscovering what makes you come alive, what makes you love, what keeps youreaching for the next mystery before you.As I noted earlier, these muscles of devotion and aspiration are cultivated mostpointedly in the grade of Philosophus, which corresponds to Netzach; for it isright at this moment, when you are nearly ready to begin the formal K & Cworking, that you must fully light the fires of aspiration. All the muscles ofdevotion must be active and fully developed. The key devotional instructionformally assigned to the Philosophus is Liber Astarte. This is a beautifullyconstructed work in which one essentially creates one’s own religious systemdevoted to the deity of choice. It is clear from the instructions in the bookthat the point here is to gain practice in the art of worship—to exercise andstrengthen the muscles of devotion, so that in the very near future, as youundertake the K & C working, you can direct this newly strengthened abilitytoward your own HGA. This makes a good deal of sense, since by definition, it isunlikely that the Philosophus has full conscious contact with the HGA, and willlikely need other gods, symbols, and images as “stand-ins.” In practice, thisneed tends to diminish quickly as the aspirant nears the climactic experiencesof the Dominus Liminis and Adeptus Minor grades, and the HGA increasinglyinstructs them in all the essentials of their true religion, as they take theirrightful place as the prophet of their own Angel.Track Five is the balancing of the psycho magical constitution. We can think ofthis as preparing ourselves as a grail—a grail for the indwelling of the lightof the Angel. If our development is unbalanced, our grail will topple. If wehave failed to build ourselves into a seamless and solid vessel, our grail willleak. Force follows form, and we must make ourselves into the perfect form that,by its design, invokes the desired force—the light of the HGA.One way we can conceptualize the process of attaining this balanced form is thepassage through the elemental grades of the First Order of A∴A∴. At each grade,the aspirant builds a symbolic weapon to symbolize and concretize the innerchanges occurring in that grade. These elemental weapons correspond, of course,to the four elements of earth, air, water and fire, but we can also understandthem in the context of Carl Jung’s four functions of the psyche: sensation,intuition, thinking, and feeling, respectively. The pantacle (disk) is theweapon of earth, Malkuth and sensation; the dagger is the weapon of air, Yesodand intuition (spiritual intuition often first manifests through thesubconscious, which is attributed to Yesod); the cup is the weapon of water, Hodand thinking; and the wand is the weapon of fire, Netzach and feeling,aspiration and desire. Additionally, at the Dominus Liminis grade the magicklamp is constructed as a symbol of the crowning of spirit over the other fourelements. All of these things—the four elements, the four functions of thepsyche, the four weapons—are representative of the balanced development of thepsycho-magical constitution. By traversing these grades in a stepwise andbalanced manner, we can indeed fashion ourselves into a perfect grail for thelight of the HGA, for the god will not indwell a temple improperly prepared.In closing, let me offer a final image for your consideration, to illustrate theoverarching process of the First Order grades: that of the magick lamp itself,already discussed above in the context of the Dominus Liminis grade. With asanaand pranayama, we begin the endeavor of transforming the physical body—thephysical design of the lamp. The more advanced kundalini practices, and thedivinized ecstasy we have cultivated, comprise the oil that is the fuel for thelamp. Through the right use of our intellect, we have chosen the correctpatterns, symbolic decorations, and dimensions for the proper functioning of thelamp. Our devotion and aspiration serve as the spark that finally ignites thelamp. All of these components must be in place, and functioning properly, forthe whole of the lamp to fulfill its purpose. Just so, all of the trainingtracks of the First Order grades must be duly mastered. With these tasksproperly executed, we await the Angel’s indwelling with love and devotion, andwith the flame of True Will burning brightly in our hearts. For “to await Theeis the end, not the beginning.”29 [index_split_045.html#filepos660469]Getting Started with A∴A∴Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.30[index_split_045.html#filepos660601]Since the death of Karl Germer (Crowley’s successor as the Head of the Order) in1962, there has been no universally acknowledged governance of A∴A∴. AfterGermer’s death, multiple claimants arose, each with its own purported leadersand its own (sometimes rather tangled) history. You will note my use of the term‘claimant group’ in this discussion. The term ‘lineage,’ which would be anobvious choice in other analogous spiritual traditions, has become sopoliticized that it is now, in some circles, synonymous with illegitimacy.However, it is abundantly clear that there are various groups claiming to beA∴A∴, hence the term ‘claimant groups.’The only manifestation of A∴A∴ I can personally vouch for in terms of itshistorical legitimacy, the competence of its leaders, and the linkage of itsadministrative Triad to the spiritual roots of the Order (the so-called ‘SecretChiefs’) is the one whose contact information appears below. Please note,however, that I am not condemning the work of other groups claiming to representA∴A∴. I have good friends within several of these groups, and it is clear thatthey are earnest seekers doing effective and important work. The most importantthing to me, by far, is simply that the system of A∴A∴ is readily available foraspirants who are called to the path.There has been some confusion regarding the relationship between the modernO.T.O. and the various claimant groups of A∴A∴. Since the early days of themodern O.T.O. in the mid-1970s, there have been initiates from multiple A∴A∴claimant groups active within O.T.O. A few years ago, some in the administrationof O.T.O. openly aligned themselves with one particular claimant group, andbegan to advertise its contact address. This is their right, and I honor theirchoice as an act of personal conscience. However, the simple fact is that thereare a great many initiates of other A∴A∴ claimant groups active in O.T.O. at thepresent time, at all levels of O.T.O. membership and leadership. It is importantto understand this, because in recent years some statements have been made (byindividuals, not by O.T.O. per se) which might confuse those aspiring to joinA∴A∴, causing them to believe that the claimant group actively promoted byO.T.O. is the only viable option for those who also happen to be O.T.O.initiates. This is simply inconsistent with the actual facts of the situation.Please note that my presentation of these facts in no way reflects a criticismof those administering O.T.O.—they have the authority to govern O.T.O. as theysee fit, and I have much respect for their work in this regard.If you are called to the work of A∴A∴, I encourage you to do your own researchand come to your own conclusions about which particular path is best for you.Ultimately, your personal spiritual attainment—the fruits of your own work—willbe the best indicator of the wisdom of your choice.A∴A∴P.O. Box 215483Sacramento, CA 95821www.onestarinsight.org [http://www.onestarinsight.org]"},{"pageContent":"16 TAROT & THE PATH OF INITIATIONProbably the most common misunderstanding about the Tarot is that it is merely atool for divination. What is often missed is that the reason it is such amagnificent system for divination is that it is a complete symbolic map of allthe transformative processes in the universe, and in every individual walkingthe path of spiritual attainment. When you think about it, it is easy to seethat it would be impossible for any system to be ideal for divination unless itembodied all of these laws of nature. After all, if you have a question in mind,but there are certain aspects of life and consciousness that are simplyinaccessible or inexpressible in a divination system, that system will not bebroad enough in scope to provide you with a complete answer.My purpose here, however, is not to review the use of Tarot as a divination tool(although I present a suggested layout and interpretive strategy at the end ofthis chapter). Rather, it is to examine the ways in which the Tarot functions asa symbolic map of the transformations occurring in you as you walk the path ofattainment. Most particularly, I will discuss the unfolding transformativeprocesses represented in the trumps of the Thoth Tarot corresponding to thepaths on the Tree of Life leading up to the Knowledge and Conversation of theHoly Guardian Angel. I won’t go into too much detail about the specific imageson the cards, however, so I suggest you have your Thoth deck handy as you readthis chapter.As you may know, the entirety of the Tarot can be mapped out onto the Tree ofLife. The sephiroth depict static states of consciousness and are attributed tothe small cards and court cards of the Tarot, whereas the paths are referred tothe trumps, and show the transformative processes related to the interplay ofthe sephiroth they connect. Much of our discussion in this chapter will focus onthe trumps’ role as ‘mediators’ between their adjacent sephiroth, thecorresponding transformations occurring in initiates of A∴A∴. The A∴A∴ system ofattainment is, of course, also based on the Tree of Life, with each sephiracorresponding to an initiatory grade, and both the sephira and the connectingpaths showing the relevant tasks of that grade. In each grade, the initiateundertakes tasks corresponding to that specific sephira as well as the pathsthat lead to the next grade. For example, as a Neophyte, your tasks will reflectthe nature of Malkuth as well as the path of tav that connects forward to thenext grade of Zelator, at Yesod. Keep this scheme in mind as you read about thevarious processes discussed here.As with any discussion of the Qabalah and the Path of Return, it is important tokeep in mind that you will feel the influence of these processes at many pointsacross your lifetime. For example, consider the sphere of Geburah, whichcorresponds to Mars, force and will. You will have many ‘Geburan’ moments woventhroughout your life—times of intense energy and power, or (less constructively)aggression and anger. But our focus here is on the unfolding of the A∴A∴ path,where your spiritual ‘location’ can be mapped out to a single, specific sephiraat any given point in your life, corresponding to your grade in the order.[images/00011.jpg]The Tarot Trumps and A∴A∴grades below TipherethLet’s review briefly the nature of the sephiroth below Tiphereth; that is, thesephiroth through which you will pass in your progress through the A∴A∴ gradesof Neophyte to Dominus Liminis, and on to Adeptus Minor and the K & C of theHGA. Malkuth is attributed to the grade of Neophyte, the element of earth, thephysical body and the material universe. Yesod is attributed to the grade ofZelator, and corresponds to subconscious, autonomic processes in the mind andbody, and to the generative, sexual power resident within every human. Hod,which corresponds to the grade of Practicus, is essentially the human intellect.Netzach, corresponding to the grade of Philosophus, is associated with emotion,aspiration, and desire. The Veil of Paroketh, beneath Tiphereth, represents theactual psychological and spiritual ‘veil’ which wards the entrance to the SecondOrder of A∴A∴, and corresponds to the grade of Dominus Liminis (“Lord of theThreshold”).Neophyte: Malkuth, and the Path of Tav[images/00010.jpg]The nature of the Neophyte’s task corresponds to the sphere of Malkuth and tothe path of tav—the Universe card. As noted above, the symbolism of Malkuth isthat of the material world, and Yesod the subconscious mind (which is ourinitial perceptual mechanism for the astral world). The Neophyte must work toincrease his or her perception of the subtle forces interpenetrating thematerial world and truly experience that these same forces are the substrate ofmaterial existence.The Path of Tav (The Universe)The path of tav and the Universe trump corresponds to the muladhara chakra andaccordingly, we see depicted on the trump the coiled kundalini. Universal mindis indeed a force—it is the creative power of the universe itself, and thisforce manifests in form. Form is a concept related to Saturn as well as earth,both of which are attributed to the Universe card. Here, we awaken our senses tothe perception of mind as living force. These are the realities of the formativeworld of Yetzirah, which are opening up to us as we walk the path of tav. It isoften in this phase that initiates begin to describe increased perception ofastral forms, and indeed this ability to control the ‘Body of Light’ is onespecific faculty being trained and tested in the Neophyte grade.The central figure on the Universe card has her legs in the form of a cross, andas you may recall, ‘cross’ is the meaning of the Hebrew letter tav, which alsoalludes to the four elements. She is partly veiled—this is the veil we must peerthrough in order to see past the material forms around us and perceive theastral substrate beneath them. This is the veil of nature itself—that barrierformed by conditioned habits of looking at the material universe—preventing usfrom seeing the deeper reality behind it. This is not a dualistic doctrinewherein the physical world is ‘evil’ and the spirit ‘good.’ Rather, the materialworld is seen as a veil whose shape may reveal to us deeper truths, and thus theworld is seen as a true manifestation of the divine. As noted above, thekundalini serpent is depicted on this trump, attributed to the muladhara chakra,and the Neophyte is beginning to undertake the activation of muladhara and theawakening of kundalini through various meditative and magical practices (seeChapter 15). We will see how this serpent force develops as we review the othertrumps leading to the K & C of the HGA.Zelator: Yesod, and the Paths of Shin and Resh[images/00004.jpg]In keeping with the overall training scheme of A∴A∴, the Zelator’s work will beintimately connected to the principles embodied by Yesod, but also relate to thepaths leading to Hod and the Practicus degree—shin (the Aeon) and resh (theSun). You will recall that Yesod corresponds to subconsciousness, sexualgenerativity, and autonomic processes. In Yesod, the nature and function of thepersonal unconscious—truly the ‘foundation’ of the psyche—is clarified. TheZelator begins conscious, willed movement of subtle forces through pranayama andrelated practices. The voice of the HGA is increasingly heard, attended to andcomprehended, in symbolic language if not yet directly and consciously. Theinitiate gradually is becoming more aware of the connection between thesubconscious mind and this spiritual intuition. Dreams and intuitive flashesbecome important symbol sets, and the initiate attains to a state ofconsciousness traditionally known as the ‘Vision of the Machinery of theUniverse.’ While this may sound a bit grandiose for a mere Zelator, this visionis truly the opening up of the initiate’s ability to feel universal mind inaction, as it flows up like an underground spring into our individualconsciousness. That is not a mere intellectual understanding that allconsciousness is an interconnected whole. Many aspirants are able to grasp theconcept from the very beginning. Rather, what we are talking about here is anexperiential awareness, a definite knowing, that universal mind is operative insubtle yet powerful ways in individual life and consciousness.The Path of Shin (The Aeon)The Aeon trump corresponds to the path of shin and connects Malkuth, the sphereof the elements, the senses, and the physical world, with Hod, the sphere of theintellect. Looking at the card, you will immediately notice is that it is avirtual hieroglyph of the concepts embodied by the Stele of Revealing, and thusalso of the core cosmology of the Aeon of Horus. Nuit, Hadit, and Heru-Ra-Ha areall symbolized on the card. Nuit arched above; Hadit as the winged globe; andHeru-Ra-Ha in the twin forms, active and passive, corresponding to Ra-Hoor-Khuitand Hoor-Paar-Kraat. This card depicts the force of the new aeon flooding theworld, its people, and its culture. The path of shin within each person is thatchannel of transformative force which revolutionizes the structures of theindividual, just as it does the world as a whole. This is the Aeonic forceflowing into you—your internal Hod and Malkuth. It brings you into the new Aeon,dissolving the outworn forms and limiting structures within your mind and body.This card is attributed to fire, and indeed it behaves accordingly. Firetransforms, restructures, and revolutionizes everything it touches. Olderversions of the card had an angel calling the dead to awaken—perhaps the oldaeon’s best attempt at depicting the influence of the HGA—but in the new aeon wehave a clearer vision of the situation. We know that we don’t need to be‘redeemed’ from death, or be obsessively focused on the apparently catastrophicnature of death, as it would have been perceived in the old aeon. Instead, wefind life-affirming symbols of regeneration and transformation that areaccessible to us at every moment in our lives. The initiate of Yesod, aspiringto the sphere of Hod and the grade of Practicus, must come to terms with thesetransformations in him- or herself.The Path of Resh (The Sun)The Sun card corresponds to the path of resh, which connects Yesod and Hod. Aswe noted with the Aeon card, the Sun trump also has both a macrocosmic andmicrocosmic import. The physical sun is light- and life-giving, and bringsvision and clarity to the physical world. Just so, the sun within us shinesforth in our own intellect; our rational mental capacity (Hod) can help us cutthrough the obscurity, the confusion and the clouds of illusion that can dwellin our subconscious. One of the things human beings must confront in the newaeon is the impact of several thousand years of cultural conditioning rooted indualistic, sin-based religions. Each of us must overturn this conditioning byallowing the inner sun to shine forth into our subconscious mind, bringing thelight of the HGA to free and liberate us. This is reflected in the imagery ofthe card—the sun itself, and the children dancing on the green earth—allbeautiful images of a true inner freedom. They are shameless and joyous. This isa depiction of the freedom of consciousness that is attainable for each of uswhen we have successfully passed through the ordeal of this path.The Sun card is also attributed to the Anahata chakra at the heart center; andthe opening of the Anahata chakra allows true agape, free love, and acceptanceof the unity of beings to emerge. We are no longer living in the restriction,fear and shame that so many who have gone before us have had to contend with.Only a Zelator who has attained to this consciousness is truly fitted to pass toPracticus.Practicus: Hod, and the Paths of Qoph, Tzaddi and Peh[images/00018.jpg]The Practicus grade corresponds to the sphere of Hod, and in this presentdiscussion, the most important key-symbols of Hod are those of a cup and thewater it contains. You will note that the weapon of the Practicus is the magickcup, and the element to which the sphere of Hod is attributed is water. Theinitiate of Hod is coming into a deeper recognition that the individual mind isa vessel for universal force. The individual mind is a form-giving vessel and areflective mirror of the macrocosm, just as the surface of water in a cupreflects the forms above it. The initiate of Hod, through various practices, isbeginning to master the conscious direction of this universal force towardspecific magical aims. If you understand that the mind and the humanconstitution is a microcosm, then you will begin to see why this is a necessarystep towards being able to truly control and direct magical force. When wedevelop a functional working relationship between aspects of self and thecorresponding aspects of the (so-called) outer world, we have a greater abilityto manipulate those forces in the outer world, according to our will.The Path of Qoph (The Moon)Aside from working with the forces embodied by Hod, the Practicus must alsotraverse the paths that lead to Netzach. The first of these is the path of qoph,attributed to the Moon trump, which connects the sphere of Malkuth (the physicalworld and body) with the sphere of Netzach (desire, emotion, and aspiration).This path represents the transition between the secure, familiar, and relativelyconcrete realities of our physical lives and the irrational, fiery, emotionalreality symbolized by Netzach. This potentially unsettling psychological stateis in evidence in the depiction on the Moon card itself. It is a night passagethrough the dark, the unknown, the vague and cloudy—the fearsome aspects of theunknown parts of ourselves—the unconscious world. The Hebrew letter qoph refersto the ‘back of the head’ and sure enough that is where primal, reactive brainfunctions are localized. The Practicus must master the fear residing in thatanimalistic aspect of the mind in order to proceed on the path towards Knowledgeand Conversation. The HGA is a harbinger of the life beyond the physical world,but facing this new life forces us to venture into the darkness of unknownaspects of ourselves.The Path of Tzaddi (The Emperor)Next is the path of tzaddi, corresponding to the Emperor trump, which connectsthe sphere of Yesod (instinct, generativity) and the sphere of Netzach (desire,aspiration). The work of this path involves channeling the forces resident inYesod towards the spiritual aim of K & C. The Hebrew letter tzaddi means ‘fishhook’ (see Liber Tzaddi for much wisdom on the role of the initiator in thisregard). The Emperor on the card is that force within us—that innerinitiator—that raises the instinctual energies of Yesod and directs them towardsour spiritual goals. Tzaddi (as a verb) means ‘to contemplate’ and one of themethods of mastering this transformational process is the contemplative path ofraja yoga, which is deeply imbedded in the work of the Practicus of A∴A∴..The Path of Peh (The Tower)The third and final path of relevance to the Practicus is that of peh, the Towertrump. One of the greatest obstacles to spiritual progress is the calcificationof old, outworn forms and ideas of self. We must be psychologically flexible andchangeable enough to allow our own evolution to take place. The path of pehconnects Hod (intellect) with Netzach (desire, aspiration). Fittingly, the Towertrump shows the fire of Netzach blasting in and destroying, reshaping andtransforming the old and outworn ideas that have become calcified in Hod. Theoverturned ideas of self tumble out of the tower as geometrical figures. Thepath of peh is also attributed to the svadisthana chakra. You will recall thatthe muladhara chakra was activated with the Universe trump, and the anahatachakra activated with the Sun trump. The activation of the svadisthana chakrawith the Tower completes an important triad: the life force is unleashed fromits root (muladhara), and put under the regency of agape (anahata). Only then isit safe to amplify the force further by virtue of the sexual potencies ofsvadisthana.Philosophus and Dominus Liminis: Netzach, the Veil of Paroketh, and the Paths ofAyin, Nun and Samekh[images/00022.jpg]The aspirant must next attain to the grade of Philosophus, corresponding toNetzach, followed by the “portal” grade of Dominus Liminis, corresponding to theveil of Paroketh that hangs below Tiphereth. The work at this stage alsopertains to the final three paths in the approach to Tiphereth and K & C of theHGA: the paths of a’ayin (the Devil), nun (Death), and samekh (Art).Let’s begin with a consideration of the work of Netzach. Netzach representsdesire and aspiration. It is the fire and force of emotion that is thecomplement of the form-giving intellect of Hod. Accordingly, the work of thePhilosophus involves the right use of this aspirational and devotional force.This is a supremely important phase of the work. Liber Astarte, which is thecentral bhakti yoga practice of the Philosophus, serves to fire up theaspirational ‘engine’ and strengthen the muscles of devotion. At this point, webridge into the Dominus Liminis grade, where everything that has gone before isharmonized, synthesized and directed with fierce and one-pointed intensitytowards Knowledge and Conversation.This is a perfect opportunity for our aspiration to waver. When we havechallenged ourselves to maintain a constant and vigilant aspiration, the ego hassome games to play with us, and it will test us in insidiously effective ways.One of the ways that it does this is by crumbling in on itself. We begin todoubt our own ability to succeed; we get bogged down and depressed. The bestpiece of advice I can offer on this point is straightforward, but not easy: justdon’t stop moving. Don’t stop working. As it turns out, the opposite of beingstuck is…going somewhere! If you are continuing to move, you are continuing toprogress.The Path of A’ayin (The Devil)One of the fascinating ways that this stagnation may tend to manifest itself issymbolized by the Devil trump. The Devil represents those aspects of life thatseem ugly, threatening and evil; and the task of working with the transformativeenergy of the Devil involves seeing past the appearance of evil. That is, wemust train ourselves to truly know that the apparently hideous reality in frontof us (from the ego’s perspective) is in fact a lesson from the HGA. We mustlearn to perceive that such abhorrent aspects of life have manifested for us tograpple with and learn from. If we get distracted by the ego’s knee-jerkresponse to such things, we tend to believe that anything the ego doesn’t likeis bad and anything that the ego does like is good. The lesson of the Devil cardis, therefore, to perceive the presence of that inner initiator, the HGA, in allmanifest reality. We can see this truth in the nature of the path of ayin, whichconnects the intellect of Hod with the spiritually awakened center ofconsciousness at Tiphereth. It depicts the tension between what the mind ishabitually pushing us to perceive, and what the real center of the spiritualself is attempting to teach us. The aspirant must internalize this lesson beforeattainment of K & C is possible.The Path of Nun (Death)Next, let’s turn out attention to the Death trump. It corresponds to the path ofnun, connecting Netzach, the sphere of emotion, desire and aspiration, withTiphereth, the enlightened spiritual center. On the surface, this path (andindeed the trump itself) appears negative because in the pre-adept stage, mosthumans perceive death as a catastrophic end. The nature of the transformativeprocess of the path of nun is that the ego lets go of the idea of catastrophicdeath. Just as it did in working the path of the Devil, the ego lets go of theidea of evil and transforms it into something spiritually useful. The realmystery of the Death trump is that physical death is not an ending, but atransformation of form. As a verb, Nun means ‘to sprout.’ The relevance here isobvious: every change and every apparent catastrophe of destruction is a mysteryof regeneration and new growth, as old forms fall away to make way for new ones.All life is constantly being transformed, and if we identify with solidcalcified form, we perceive it as catastrophic death; but if we identify withthe transformative process itself—if we identify with the eternal unfoldingevolution of all things—then there is majesty, wonder and beauty in thisprocess. This particular form of ego-transcendence is yet another essentialelement in the progress toward K & C.The Path of Samekh (Art)The final trump to consider in our discussion here is the Art card,corresponding to the path of samekh. Samekh connects Yesod, the generative,sexual, instinctual, subconscious center, and Tiphereth, the awakened spiritualself. The Hebrew word samekh means ‘a prop’ or ‘a support’ and corresponds toSagittarius, the arrow. This path between Yesod and Tiphereth is deeply embeddedwith symbols that all relate to the uplifting of self—the firing of the arrow ofaspiration toward Tiphereth. Interestingly, we do not approach Tiphereth fromthe sephira corresponding to the previous elemental grade (Netzach); rather, weshoot right up the middle pillar of the Tree. As Yesod is attributed to theMoon, and Tiphereth to the Sun, one of the mysteries encoded here is that the K& C is in one respect a union of the Sun and the Moon within us. That is, thereceptive and reflective lunar consciousness of Yesod is wedded to thespiritually awakened solar radiance of Tiphereth, opening our minds at bothconscious and unconscious levels to the influence of the HGA. Another importantsymbolic process relevant here is represented by the name “VITRIOL” on the Artcard. This translates roughly as, “Visit the interior of the earth, and byrectification thou shalt find the hidden stone.” That hidden stone is the stoneof True Will and true Selfhood attained by virtue of the K & C. It is theQuintessence, the Stone of the Philosophers, and the Summum Bonum.May these trumps of the holy Tarot be beacons to light your path toward the HolyGuardian Angel.Sample Divination Method(Adapted from the principles of Jungian psychology)> > 1.

This is equally true of the process of initiation,where the candidate is in many senses the talisman of the working, and theforces in play must be mobilized in all Four Worlds in order to properly chargethis talisman. In this chapter, I will discuss the application of the formula ofTetragrammaton (the divine name Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh) to the proper execution ofmagical ritual, and especially the process of initiation itself.In keeping with Crowley’s theses in the preface to Magick in Theory andPractice, we may define initiation as the process of applying an appropriateforce (the ritual itself) to an ‘inert’ object (the candidate) to give it aspecific magical trajectory (a stimulus to move toward higher consciousness,generally, or toward some other intended magical goal). In one fundamentalsense, initiation is defined by its results. Given a potent and unbroken chainof power through the Four Worlds (the ‘pronunciation’ of the Tetragrammaton),these results will occur, for this chain is predicated on its harmony with thelaws of nature.Yet, as stated above, this magical force must have a suitable vehicle for itsmanifestation. In terms of personal initiation this vehicle is, of course, thecandidate. How do we ensure that we are prepared for this influx of force? Toanswer this question, let us take as an example the ultimate magical initiation,that of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. In theQabalistic model which forms the foundation of the system of the A∴A∴ (seeChapters 15 and 17) the aspirant must fashion him or herself into a true“grail”—a balanced and sound vessel capable of giving form to, and withstandingthe intensity of, the light of the HGA. This grail is forged from the balancedattainment of the elemental grades, corresponding to the four sephiroth belowTiphereth. Crowned by the experience of the HGA at Tiphereth, the microcosmicpentagram is complete. Paradoxically, upon attainment of the K & C, the adeptthen takes up the task of aspiration unto the true and ultimate grail, thesupernal Cup of Babalon. Keep this idea of the grail in mind as you read whatfollows.We often think of initiation in terms of formal ritual processes, yet furtherreflection reveals that in fact, initiation occurs in many forms, day to day,through our life experiences themselves. I’ve constructed a model of theinitiatory process based on the formula of Tetragrammaton. This model includesboth formal and “informal” initiatory stages, and I will trace each stage below.Stage 1: Yod/AtziluthStage One corresponds to the world of Atziluth. Before any true initiation canoccur, the link to the highest spiritual sources must be forged. In an absolutesense, of course, this link is always there—every human exists as amanifestation of that spiritual seed—yet if we are to fully extend the influenceof the highest into our initiatory work, we must consciously link ourselves toAtziluthic power, and bring it down through the other three worlds.Formally, this link is forged by the magician’s designing and carrying out theritual; that is, the ritual officers themselves. There should be some form ofgeneral invocation of the highest spiritual powers, or at least of theAtziluthic powers relevant to the ritual context. In a ritual context, thiswould consist of those portions of the ceremonial opening which call upon suchforces: general invocations such as the preliminary invocation of the Goetia(the “Bornless” invocation), a Middle Pillar-type exercise, or similarinvocations. Regardless of the specific procedures involved, the result is thesame: a link is forged to Atziluth, the “Secret Chiefs,” the “Third Order,” andso on. The names are far less important than the powers they embody.As alluded to above, the informal linkage to Atziluth is the eternal presence ofthe star within each initiate—the yechidah of Qabalah, the Self of Jungianpsychology, the Holy Guardian Angel of Thelemic tradition. Whether or not theinitiate is conscious of this linkage, it is a prerequisite to his or her verylife, and is therefore certainly essential to any given initiatory process.Stage 2: Heh/BriahOnce the Atziluthic link has been consciously forged, we move from the generalto the specific. That is, we activate the specific powers and energies unique tothe purpose of the working. In formal ritual, this includes specific elemental,planetary, and similar forces, invoked through any number of combinations ofprocedures, such as pentagram and hexagram rituals, dramatic enactments, sigils,incenses, poetry, and the like. In essence, we have particularized theAtziluthic power source to the Briatic level of the candidate’s psyche. SinceBriatic consciousness, in any given individual, is theoretically synonymous withthe influence of the HGA, we are essentially enlisting the explicit aid of thecandidate’s HGA in the work at hand. Ritually, this is accomplished through theMagical Oath. Even if the candidate has no conscious linkage to their HGA, byaligning themselves with the contents of the Oath, they bring their whole beinginto accord with the purpose of the initiation ritual, under the auspices oftheir HGA.The Briatic world is the level of the universal will, chiah, reflected into, andinformed by, the spiritual intuition of neshamah. It is this truest form ofinstruction, the neshamah, that descends into the candidate’s consciousness inthe “person” of the HGA. Any time we allow this force to break through into ourconscious action, aligning our personal will with the universal will, we areindeed initiating ourselves into a new path of service. This is the heh stage oflife’s informal initiations—the action and presence of the HGA in our everythought, word and deed.Stage 3: Vav/YetzirahIn order to comprehend consciously this spiritually informed intuition, we mustlearn to speak its language, and that language is the world of symbol andmetaphor. The vav stage of initiation involves the translation of this symboliclanguage into symbols comprehensible by the ordinary human intellect. The morethe candidate works to develop an inner language of symbol, the easier it willbe to benefit from the influx of these energies during and after initiation.This is not to say that initiations must be understood intellectually to beeffective. The seeds planted unconsciously through initiatory processes takeroot regardless of our apprehension of them. Yet, the more we can consciouslyintegrate what we are taught by the neshamah, the more we can live our lives inaccordance with that truest will. When Abramelin describes the Angel writing in“dew” upon a “silver plate” (Yesod/Yetzirah), we may understand this to mean thereflective, receptive capacity of our own subconscious mind. Initially, in thepre-adept stages, these communications may come in the form of dreams, intuitive“flashes”, creative works, and the more subtle beginnings of chakra activation.As the aspirant approaches adepthood, his or her ability to “decode” thesecommunications from the HGA becomes progressively stronger. When theseperceptive abilities are just strong enough, the door to full, consciouscommunion with the HGA opens (though the new adept might spend the rest of hisor her life strengthening the relationship).All of the above comments apply to the “informal” life initiations underdiscussion here. In terms of formal initiation ritual, the vav stage involvesexplicit use of visible symbols, movements, light changes, sounds, speeches,poetry, music and any number of other means to activate and make receptive thecandidate’s unconscious mind, and impress the object of the working upon it. Ifyou have any experience of formal initiatory work you will immediately recallthe symbols used. Upon further reflection, you will likely observe that thespecific symbols used did indeed embody the translation of the object of theworking into this language of the unconscious. Beyond any actual physicalsymbols used, a trained initiation team may be able to use their own powers ofvisualization and inner symbol-making to channel actual Yetziratic force inservice of the initiatory goal. That is, the collective “mind” of the initiationteam creates a psychic environment optimized for the candidate’s apprehension ofthe goals of the operation. The “thicker” this psychic atmosphere, the morelikely it is to truly charge and impact the talisman of the working—thecandidate—assuming the foregoing procedures have made him or her suitablyreceptive.Stage 4: Heh-final/AssiahThe crystallization of all the above stages in the world of Assiah issimultaneously the most concrete, yet also the most subtle stage of the wholeprocess. Essentially, this is the stage where we lock all the foregoing changesinto the physical vehicle, and externalize our inner experience into daily life.Thought precedes word, and word precedes deed. If Aztiluth and Briah representthe thought, and Yetzirah exemplifies the symbolic word issuing forth from thatthought, then Assiah is the inevitable deed that results from this process.Exactly how this deed will be enacted is left to the subtle art of the magician.Who can say how a given individual will apply her newfound creative genius tothe external world, or how a candidate in a specific initiation will actualizethe teachings found within? These are the fruits of life’s informal initiations.In formal ritual, this Assiatic stage is enacted through various means,including physical stimulation of chakras, administration of eucharists,application of robes or regalia to the candidate, and so on. Suitably trainedinitiators are able to use the force of their own visualizations and other innerwork to assist in this ‘locking-in’ of the effects in the physical body of thecandidate. After all, the effective consecration of a talisman explicitlyrequires the magician to have the ability to bring this power down to theAssiatic level—and in this present example, the candidate is that talisman.EXERCISEThis exercise is designed to have a priming effect on the psyche, much likefertilizing soil for seeds to be planted. Conscientious use of this exercise mayhelp you build the necessary bridges across the Four Worlds in order toactualize a specific personal or magical goal. It utilizes imagery and energiesthat may allow you to activate consciously those aspects of the psyche (andbeyond) that correspond to the Tetragrammaton. You will note some similaritywith the traditional Middle Pillar exercise. The present exercise couldcertainly be augmented and intensified by vibrating the appropriate divine namesat each of the centers. If you include these vibrations, it is stronglyrecommended that you conclude with one of the “circulations” described byRegardie and others (one such circulation involves seeing the energy moving downthe front of the aura on the exhalation, and up the back of the aura on theinhalation).You may wish to record yourself describing these steps out loud, for later useas a self-guided imagery exercise.Step One: Choose a transformative goal, whether conceived aspersonal/psychological or magical. Next, choose a vivid and specific symbol torepresent it—essentially an inner talisman. The image of the grail isrecommended in this context, as our purpose here is primarily that of fashioningourselves into a perfect vehicle for the divine. Alternative symbols include theAnkh, the Star of Babalon, the Unicursal Hexagram, images from the Stele, and soon. Let your own imagination and personal symbol system guide you in this. Setaside one or more periods of meditation upon this symbol, while simultaneouslyvisualizing the desired goal. You should include as much visual and emotionaldetail as possible, so that the symbol becomes increasingly charged with theinnate power and necessity of the desired outcome. Feel yourself living the newreality, pouring this intention into the symbol.Step Two: Set aside about thirty minutes when you can be uninterrupted. Sit inyour favorite asana. Begin gentle, rhythmic breathing. Continue for 5-10 minutesuntil you are very relaxed and still, inwardly and outwardly.Step Three: YOD. Visualize a star in the heavens, the brightest in the sky. Seeit become your own crown center. Intensify this visualization as you aspire tothe highest and most exalted conception of divinity you can imagine. As you dothis, the crown center glows brighter and brighter with white brilliance. Youare linking yourself to the universal will, the primal fire, the yod of YHVH.Step Four: HEH. See the light pour down a shaft from the crown, filling thethroat center with a slightly less brilliant white. If you have establishedconscious relations with your HGA, use whatever formulae the HGA has taught youto request aid in this endeavor. If you are not yet consciously in communicationwith your HGA, simply know that you are asking the Angel for assistance.Step Five: VAV. Now visualize the grail or other symbol at the heart center. Seethe white light descend from the throat center to the grail at the heart,infusing the heart center, and the symbol itself, with yellow-gold light. Then,see this golden light-infused symbol descent to the genital center, where itchanges to a lush violet color. Conceive that it is “locked in” in thesubconscious. It may even feel like a “click” of sorts, at the back of the headin the region of the brain stem.Step Six: HEH-FINAL. Feel the symbol dissolve into golden-white sparks ofcharged light which, in a single cycle of breath, circulate throughout the body.Every cell is filled with the light as the whole process is locked in inAssiah—anchored at the physical level.Step Seven: Remain in stillness as you renew the vivid visualizations describedat the beginning of this exercise. When ready, gradually bring yourself back tonormal awareness. Record the results in your magical diary. Repeat asappropriate—I recommend at least once per week for several weeks.ConclusionIt is my hope that the present discussion and exercises will prompt you towardfurther exploration and development of your own inner symbol system. Meditationon the formula of Tetragrammaton, and its correspondence to your own experiencesduring ritual in general, and initiation in particular, will indeed assist youin becoming that grail of which we speak—a true and fitting vessel for thelight."},{"pageContent":"18 THE CHAKRASGiven the ancient origins of the doctrine of the chakras, and its considerableinfluence on a wide variety of traditions, it is no surprise that there areinnumerable ways to contemplate the chakra system in the context of personaltransformation. Accordingly, we will limit ourselves to a certain vantage pointin our discussion of the chakras in this chapter. Essentially, we will explorethe chakras as a means of understanding the stages of personal transformation inthe Thelemic magical path, rather than as energy centers in the body per se. Inmy opinion, there is so much focus placed on the ‘energy center’ idea in populardiscussion that we miss out on the larger significance of the transformativemodel discussed here. We will be using sephirothic attributions based on thosegiven in Crowley’s 777 (column 118) with a few of my own adaptations. Also,we’ll draw heavily on the work of Joseph Campbell, who has much of value to addto our understanding of the system.The stages of transformation under discussion here apply (when considered on agrand scale) to the unfolding of the Great Work and the system of A∴A∴ fromProbationer to Ipsissimus; and I will review the attributions of the chakras tospecific sephiroth. It is important to note, however, that when I say that achakra is related to a particular sephira, I’m not implying that an awakening ofthis chakra is synonymous with the attainment of the corresponding A∴A∴ grade.Rather, I’m describing the degree to which, in a given moment of consciousness,the ‘circuit’ is sufficiently complete for us to have glimpses of levels ofexpanded awareness and consciousness. We don’t generally stay in that state forvery long. As we move along in the path of return, we manage to stay in thesestates longer and longer; but especially in the early stages of the work, wequickly drop back ‘down’ into the lower chakras as we deal with the ins and outsof daily life. I can say with virtual certainty that there’s not an adept in theworld who doesn’t sometimes regress to a reactive/animalistic state of mind inresponse to mundane daily stresses. That’s simply the human body engaging itsfight-or-flight response, impinging on consciousness, and it’s going to happenno matter how high you’ve climbed on the mountain of attainment.[images/00009.jpg]The ChakrasAs many of you know, in the O.T.O. system of initiation there are certainattributions of the degrees to the chakras and, for obvious reasons, I’m notgoing to discuss the specifics of O.T.O. degrees here. O.T.O. initiates may wishto review the diagram in The Equinox, Volume III, Number 10, which gives thecorrespondences between the chakras and the degrees in the Man of Earth triad,as an additional symbolic overlay on our discussion in this chapter.MuladharaWe begin, of course, with the muladhara chakra, which means “root base.” This isMalkuth. The psyche is essentially inert. The basic nature of this consciousnessis of a binding force—the binding force of matter and of the illusion of purelymaterial existence. The obstacles for growth here are a desire for physicalsecurity, a clinging to the illusion of physical security or safety. We areguided primarily by fear responses. This is the animalistic brain with itsprimal survival instinct. To transcend this state, we have to disidentify withthe survival impulse as the primary center of our focus. Compare this to theA∴A∴ Neophyte’s task to control the body of light. In accomplishing this task,which corresponds to the path of tav, we expand our consciousness to transcendthe limiting belief that we are our physical bodies. You can readily see howthis relates to the ordeal of the muladhara described above.Joseph Campbell gives a compelling image for this struggle, drawn from thevarious myths relating to dragons. As you know, in many such myths the dragon isguarding a hoard of some kind, and typically this involves a woman, and/or atreasure of some kind. Consider that the virgin corresponds to Yesod, the sexuallife, the vitality, the divine force within us; and the gold to Anahata, theTiphereth center, the gold of awakened spiritual selfhood. What a compellingimage! The dragon, symbolizing absorption in matter and a clinging to materialthings, is preventing us from accessing the regenerative power of Yesod and thelight-giving adepthood of Tiphereth.SvadisthanaNext, we have the svadisthana chakra. This translates roughly as “her favoriteresort,” or “her favorite standing place,” and I attribute this to Yesod. Thelevel of functioning here is still primarily self-serving. Whilemuladhara-consciousness is self-serving in its focus on physical survival, atsvadisthana we have broadened our concern to include survival via perpetuationof our progeny through sexual reproduction. Of course, at the animal level ofawareness, we’re oblivious to the will of our DNA to survive and perpetuateitself. As human animals in this unawakened state, we’re mostly just aware ofwanting sex for pleasure, or to produce offspring to ensure family survival, tofulfill societal or identity expectations, and so on.The typical obstacle here is an excessive obsession with sex. Freud’s libidotheory was, of course, concerned with psychopathological manifestations at thislevel of consciousness. To transcend it, we must ‘unclench’ the muscles ofsexual repression/obsession, and allow the sex force to seek its higher aim—thetransformation of the psyche in its higher aspects. In other words, we have toperceive that the real aim of this force within us, this regenerative power, isto transform us from animals into fully-realized humans and eventually, intogods.Rightly understood, svadisthana-consciousness can be our first glimpse of thedivine power in life . We don’t yet recognize it as being within us necessarily,but it is our first psychologically significant encounter with divinity. In thecorresponding Yesod grade of A∴A∴, the Zelator works to intensify the awarenessand flow of the sex force/life force via the beginning practices of pranayama.ManipuraNext is the manipura chakra, which means “city of jewels.” I attribute this toboth Hod and Netzach together. Whereas svadhisthana as being reflective of thatstage of consciousness focused on the drive toward sex, at manipura we arefocused on the drive to possess power. This is still self-serving, but the focusis personal power within a social context. It takes into account the existenceof a community, but the aim is still personal power, dominance over the herd,being the alpha animal in the pack. Campbell even refers to this state of mindas the ‘yoga of war.’ When rightly developed, it serves a more evolved purposerelated to the vishuddhi chakra (more on this later), but for most humans, mostof the time, this is simply a drive to control our social environment.I noted that manipura is attributed to Hod and Netzach. It is perhapssignificant that the path connecting these sephiroth is the path of peh (theTower), where we go to war with our own limiting conceptions and outworn formsof consciousness in order to rebuild them into something more healthy andfunctional. To transcend this state, we must find a way to be centered in ourown power without the need to control or dominate others to survive; to get pastthe illusion of others as entities that must be subjugated. In other words, wemove upward toward the awakening of the anahata chakra.AnahataWe should pause here to note that the three chakras we’ve discussed sofar—muladhara, svadhisthana, and manipura—all represent essentially primal andanimalistic levels of consciousness. Up to this point, a person who is livingpredominantly out of these stages of awareness is barely exceeding thefunctioning of a lower animal. The transformations that occur from this pointonward allow us to become truly human and, eventually, superhuman.Anahata means ‘not hit’ or ‘unstruck.’ And when is something ‘not hit’? Whenthere is only one thing. The awakening of the anahata chakra brings theawareness of the unity of human experience and consciousness. Agape. Anahatarepresents that awakened consciousness of the spiritual interconnectedness ofall beings. This is the consciousness behind the ‘namaste’ greeting, in whichthose exchanging the words recognize the common divinity in each other. At thisstage, however, it is still experienced in relation to other people who areperceived as external and separate beings. We have not yet evolved to the placewhere there is a full experience of the unity of consciousness—but at least wehave become aware of the concept! The traditional word of the anahata chakra isAUM, signifying that all other words are merely fragments of this one GreatWord, just as all manifest forms are but fragments of the One.In the system of A∴A∴, the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angelat Tiphereth brings us into awareness of our relationship to the Holy GuardianAngel; but even the Adeptus Minor is not fully and permanently conscious of theunion with the Holy Guardian Angel. This takes much additional work—the work ofthe other sephiroth attributed to anahata in our scheme here, Chesed andGeburah, as well as the supernal triad of Kether, Chokmah and Binah.Yet the adept of Tiphereth has nonetheless entered into a real consciousrelationship with the beloved, the Angel. He or she is ‘face to face’ with theAngel, as in a marriage, yet it is still perceived as a self-and-otherrelationship.VishuddhiNext we have the vishuddhi chakra, which means “purgation.” This is essentiallya purging of the ruach obsessions, which is essential for attainment of supernalconsciousness; that is, for the crossing of the Abyss, and the transcendence ofthe limitations of human life and human consciousness. When the vishuddhi chakrais ‘closed,’ we might attribute it to Da’ath—the false ‘knowledge’ which isstill bound up in ego-consciousness, as opposed to transcendent awareness. Theopening of vishuddhi corresponds to the crossing of the Abyss and the resultingattainment of Binah.Something very interesting is happening here with the energy of manipura. Youwill recall that manipura has previously been essentially facing ‘outward’ intothe world, using its energy to conquer and gain power over others. But now,rightly understood and rightly applied, this energy—this conquering energy, thisyoga of war—is turned inward and brought to bear on the transformation of theself. This is the inner war, traditionally called the ‘turning about of theShakti.’ We move away from the erroneous conception that our destructive forceshould be used against others for our own power purposes, and arrive at theenlightened awareness that the primary war to be fought is against our ownlimiting conceptions of self. This represents full attainment of vishuddhiconsciousness.AjnaThe next chakra is ajna, which means ‘command’ or ‘summoning.’ Ajna isattributed to the sphere of Chokmah. Campbell says this is like seeing God, butthrough a pane of glass. The human soul is finally face-to-face with divinity,but there is still a separation. From this vantage point, we are uniquelypositioned to experience all the ego we have built, developed, and lived in, yetwe can also glimpse the worlds beyond it. In this threshold state, we have onefoot in ego-consciousness and the other in the divine world.At Chokmah, the grade of the Magus in the A∴A∴ system, we gain consciousness ofour word (logos) – the one formula of our existence which is our unique link touniversal will. But we’re still one step removed from complete identity withoneness. After all, in order to have a logos that you deliver to the world, youstill have to posit a distinction between the thing delivering the word and thething that receives it. This is still not quite the level of unity we will seein our examination of the sahasrara chakra below.One final note regarding ajna: Just as the force of manipura is elevated toimpinge on vishuddhi, so that inner development takes the place of undue outwardaggression; so here, the force of svadhisthana—the outward expression of thelife force as physical sex—is introverted as ecstatic devotion to the divinewithin. So, here again, we have elevated an aspect of one of the ‘animalistic’chakras and applied it to a higher center.SahasraraSahasrara means ‘thousand-petaled.’ Here, we attain to complete union with thebeloved, the HGA, the All, God (fill in the blank with your favorite term).There is no separation; this is the Kether point. Here we are released from thebondage of matter, and the corpse of Malkuth is rightly seen as thedeathlessness of the pure spirit. As it is said, Kether is in Malkuth.Interestingly, some depictions of the sahasrara chakra feature the bodies ofshava—which means corpse—back-to-back with Shiva—who is, of course, the deity.We can understand this to be a statement about the close relationship of deathand immortality.The ninth century Sufi master Mansur al-Hallaj has a story that beautifullyillustrates the nature of this transition from ajna to sahasrara, where we movefrom seeing God through a pane of glass to being God. There was once a moth thatwas drawn each night toward a flame burning in a lantern enclosed by panes ofglass. Night after night, the moth pounded its body against the glass indesperate longing—seeing the object of its devotion right there, but unable toreach it. Then one day the door of the lantern happened to be left open, and themoth was able to fly into the flame, where it was annihilated in ecstasy. And inthat moment of annihilation—which is from our human ego-bound perspective, themoment of its death—it actually achieved its goal of union with the flame. Itbecame the flame, became God.There is a teaching that after the attainment of sahasrara the initiate returnsto anahata, to abide in love in that place where we perceive divinity inrelationship to the world, partaking of both divine and human consciousnesssimultaneously. Recall the hero’s journey, where the hero has gone out to slaythe dragon and obtained the reward or treasure. The hero doesn’t simply wanderoff with the gold and the girl to settle down and enjoy the treasure just forhimself. The hero comes back to society and shares the treasure. Just so, theoverarching path of the Great Work is characterized by this service to humanity.Crowley talks about this in comparable terms when he says that the Magistercrosses the Abyss, attains to supernal consciousness, and is then cast out intothe sphere of his or her work in the world—the sphere best suited to his or hermanifest gifts. Thus, the path of individual attainment is ultimately identicalto the path of service to all humanity. What appears initially to be a hero’sjourney for the sake of individual development has revealed its deeper purpose:It the path towards immersion in the consciousness of the All and the devotionof everything we are to the service of that consciousness."},{"pageContent":"19 THE ROLE OF THE EGO IN THE GREAT WORKThe human ego is, by design and of necessity, an essential working tool of everymagician. Before going further in our exploration of the ego’s role in the GreatWork, it is extremely important to understand that when I use the term ego here,I am using it in the sense adopted by Carl Jung. It is not used in a pejorativesense, as when we say someone has “a lot of ego” or that they are “egotistical.”The ego, as discussed here, is simply the everyday self, the primary center ofconsciousness that you carry with you in everyday activities. Ego simply means‘I’. It is the ‘I’ that goes to the store, that goes to work, that likes anddislikes things, that consciously perceives beauty, fear and pain, and so on.In the stages of the Great Work prior to full adepthood—that is, beforeKnowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel—the characteristic stateof consciousness is one of primarily identifying with the ego as the center ofself. This perspective is gradually overturned across the First Order grades ofA∴A∴, but most magicians in the pre-adept phase, most of the time, primarilyidentify themselves with the ego, whether they realize it or not.In contrast, we have what Jung called the Self (I will capitalize this term todistinguish it from ‘self’ when used as a casual, general reference to oneself).This is the real center of our being. In the pre-adept phase, we’re mostlyunconscious; but through insight-oriented work in psychotherapy, and certainlyvia the magical and mystical path when rightly pursued, we open up consciousawareness of this Self. The opening of this awareness in a secular,psychotherapeutic context might include working with dream symbols, developmentof intuition, tracing a symbolic narrative by watching the synchronicities thatoccur in our lives, and similar processes. Within our esoteric work, the Qabalahand the other symbol systems form a vital framework for our interactions withour own unconscious, and they therefore open the pathway to connection with theSelf.The forging of this conscious connection between ego and Self is the centralgoal of the work in the Jungian psychoanalytical tradition, but it is also oneway of looking at the path of the Great Work—a mode of transformation thatmagicians pursue in a deeper way than your average analysand (the technical termfor person undergoing psychoanalysis.) In any case, it is the forging of thisso-called “ego-Self axis” which informs much of our discussion here.In this chapter, I will be using not only the terminology from the Jungian modelof the psyche–‘ego’, ‘Self’ and ‘shadow’ and the like—but also the analogouslanguage of Qabalistic psychology. For our purposes here, ego=ruach andSelf=neshamah. These are not perfect analogies, but they are close enough forour discussion here (see figures below).[images/00017.jpg]The Jungian Model of the Psyche on the Tree of Life[images/00015.jpg]The Qabalistic ‘Parts of the Soul’ on the Tree of LifeLet’s begin with a look at the everyday functioning of the ego. What purposedoes it serve? How does it help us, and how can it hurt us? The most importantfundamental here is to understand that the ego is the perceptual mechanism bywhich we interact constructively with the outer world. It’s completely necessaryto this interaction; without it, we are impotent to exert our will upon thephysical reality that surrounds us. Accordingly, at no point does the magiciantruly engage in a permanent “destruction of the ego.” Rather, through the GreatWork, we come to understand the proper role and function of the ego. We put itin the proper relationship with the Self, and ultimately, we are able toidentify with that deepest Self, the real center of who we are—the star orkhabs.The ego is the lens through which we perceive the outer world. It is necessarilyindividualized and, therefore, limited in its vision. The information we gain bythe useful illusion of viewing ourselves as a separate being—the illusion of aninner and an outer world—allows us to function in that outer world. We would beunable to lead a constructive life if we were always immersed inundifferentiated cosmic consciousness. Just imagine trying to do your groceryshopping in that state of mind!One of the important mechanisms of the ego’s functioning—that is, one of theways that it actually serves as a lens to look at the world—is via thepsychological projections that we indulge in every day. In one sense, allperception is a psychological projection, in that we are imposing symbol sets,categories and other labels onto the mass of perceptions that come to us; itwill always be filtered and interpreted by the ego. Yet we can do some veryimportant work to grow our understanding of our ego and its role in the GreatWork by taking a closer look at these psychological projections—especially whenwe project onto other people.In a negative projection, the ego protects itself by judging the faults ofothers rather than undergoing the painful introspection necessary for its ownreal growth. In a positive projection – such as idealizing a loved one—the egoyearns for union with something it perceives as external to itself and therebymisses the opportunity to recognize the soul’s inherent completeness. So, inboth cases, we’re trapped in the self-other dichotomy. In one case it is anegative judging energy, and in the other case it is disowning an aspect of ourown divinity—a part of our own wholeness. We fall into the trap of believingthat we need to unite with something exterior in order to be whole and healthy.In either case, we are confronting the shadow.The shadow, in Jungian terms, is almost literally like a shadow cast by theego—the silhouette formed by those areas where the light of self-knowledge doesnot shine. It is all those things we do not accept as ourselves—all thoseunacknowledged or rejected aspects of the self, both positive and negative.Crowley provides some interesting commentary on this phenomenon in Liber Aleph.Here are a few key passages from the chapters titled “On Certain Diseases ofDisciples” and “On Watching for Faults in the House,” which flow together into asingle thread of discussion.> > > > > …We become that which obsesseth us, either through extreme Hate or> > > > > Extreme Love.

And once again, our Great Work consists of forgingthat link between ego and Self, consciously aligning our ego with the full powerof the real trajectory of our soul—the True Will.To use a technological metaphor: the state of the ego/ruach is like thebandwidth we have available for the influx of spiritual force. If the bandwidthis narrowed—if we have narrowed ourselves via egoic obsessions, projections, orimbalances—we have actually reduced our capacity to be a channel of this divineforce. Understood in this fashion, one can easily see the importance of theself-analysis of the personality that is built into any competently executedmagical training.The ego is the part of you that feels pain, anger, joy; but you are much morethan this. The real Self is far more expansive than this limited set offunctions; although most of us, most of the time, operate day-to-day as if weare no more than a ‘thinking and feeling machine.’ That’s one of the inherentlimitations of our ego. Accordingly, one of the greatest traps in life is tobelieve what the ego is telling us as if it is the only truth. When we are in adepression, when we are overwhelmingly anxious, when we are hurt or angry, wemust strive to step back from the ego’s limited perspective, and remember thatthe part of us experiencing the distress is not the whole of us, and certainlynot the core of who we really are.The Self—that khabs-star at our spiritual center—is not worried about paying thebills. The Self is not worried about what so-and-so said that hurt our feelings.That’s simply the ego. If we can view the ego more like a pet and less like whowe really are, we can get some degree of distance on life’s troubles. Thatdoesn’t mean we reject them. That doesn’t mean we belittle them. That doesn’tmean we pretend that we don’t have these feelings and responses. As I saidbefore, it’s the ego that is our information-gathering mechanism in the world.Accordingly, attending to these perceptions and experiences of Ego is actually adoorway into deeper work.Our goddess Nuit represents the infinite realm of all possibilities ofexperience presented to us. If we feel an emotion we don’t like—if we reject itand try to run away from it or suppress it—we are essentially saying, ‘I rejectthis aspect of Nuit.’ I think you will agree that this is not going to be aproductive way of living in the long run. We may temporarily avoid some degreeof ego-based discomfort, but in the process we alienate ourselves from theperfection of the reality being presented to us. This condition is very muchlike having a roadmap, but refusing to acknowledge where we are on it, simplybecause we don’t like the scenery. Instead, we must accept where we are and thendecide where we want to go.As I said earlier, the disidentification with the ruach-ego and theidentification with neshamah-Self as the real center of who we are is theoverarching goal; but there are dangers of doing this prematurely. These dangersfall under the broad category of ego inflation – when the ego gets a little toofull of itself. This is more or less the baseline functioning of all humans fromtime to time. An example of this, all too common in magical communities, is ayoung magician who has prematurely identified with their idealized adept Self,imagining that some early successes in magick are proof of full attainment. Theythereby attempt to make an end-run around the ego development which is actuallya prerequisite to truly becoming an adept. There are no short cuts.Some people are – by karma, by birth, by genetics, or other factors—ratherprecocious in their ego development (and I mean that in a good sense) in thatthat they seem to be on the fast track to spiritual development without fallinginto some of the pitfalls—the neuroses—associated with the ego. But for the mostpart, we all have a long and winding road to follow as we ferret out thoseshadowy elements of ourselves, developing our self-understanding gradually andnot always comfortably.The proper method of pursuing this work (and by ‘proper’ I mean gradual andbalanced) is built into the First Order grades of A∴A∴, and it begins by findingKether in Malkuth. The observing ego at Tiphereth sees the light of Kether inthe natural world of Malkuth—since that is its role as a perceptual tool. Theego also (occasionally) peers into the subconscious realm of Yesod—the nephesh(‘animal soul’)—the personal unconscious in Jung’s model.What is not happening in the pre-adept stage is direct conscious perception ofKether. Rather, the initiate at this stage is looking at the reflection of thatdivinity in the outer world and seeing that as a pathway inward. The perceptionof this pathway grows in accuracy across the first order grades. Later, atTiphereth, we open up to the path of gimel (Briatic consciousness) impingingdirectly and consciously on our spiritual perception in Tiphereth. This is thecharacteristic psycho-spiritual state associated with the Knowledge andConversation of the HGA. Only a balanced Ego will be a proper vessel for thisconscious communion. In the chapter on methods and tools of A∴A∴, I likened thisprepared ego to a properly formed and balanced cup, ready to contain the lightof the Angel.The greater the attainment, the greater the danger of ego inflation. It would benice if Knowledge and Conversation wiped out all of the ego’s neuroses and madethe adept a nice person to be around all the time. But unfortunately, everyattainment has its shadow side and every adept, however advanced, must deal withthe shadow side of their station on the path. The shadow side of Tiphereth(which in its fullness signifies spiritual enlightenment) is spiritual vanity.“Wow, I’m so cool now that I’ve arrived here! I’ve got a Holy Guardian Angel andnow I’m even more powerful!” Every newly minted adept of Tiphereth will fighttheir own version of this battle. Ideally, it will be caught early in theprocess, and transcended with good-humored humility.By virtue of persistent self-exploration, analysis of projections, and thebalancing tasks of the first order, the ego has found its right place inrelationship to the Angel and to the deeper Self—the link between ruach andneshamah has been forged and stabilized. Yet it is precisely at this point ofapparent stability where the ego comes up against the greatest challenge it willever encounter. It must come to terms with the futility of holding on to itssense of individual existence. As stated above, it is not that the ego mustactually be destroyed—the adept will still need it in order to function in theouter world; rather, the adept must be willing to destroy it—to lose all senseof identity at the level of the individual personality. Why? Because only afully developed ego/ruach that is also willing to abandon itself is a suitableoffering to the grail of Babalon, and only such a full offering will entitle theadept to cross the Abyss and attain to mastery.For further insights into this material, you might wish to refer to RobertMoore’s book, King, Warrior, Magician, Lover.32[index_split_045.html#filepos660893] He explores these four archetypes both intheir fullness and in their shadow sides. He discusses the magician archetype asone of inner power—secret, subtle, and non-physical. This is obviously animportant tool for living; but on the shadow side, it represents a clingingcontrol and manipulativeness—a debased and insecure lust for personal power.This calls to mind the polarity of the Adeptus Exemptus in his or her fullness,willing to move on and abandon ego conceptions, versus the Black Brother in histowers of ego—a fortress he refuses to abandon for fear of losing personalpower. In the Parsifal story, this is the dichotomy between Parsifal (in hisfinal attainment as the Grail King) versus the wizard Klingsor, who has simplystolen the sacred spear and locked himself in his tower, ever fearful of losingthe trappings of power—an epitome of the tragic heights of ego inflation.ConclusionAll parts of the soul are sacred, and no element of the human constitution is‘evil.’ The ego is an integral part of effective life as a human being, and wemust strive to understand its functioning and allow it to serve in its rightfulrole. If you approach this task with courage, honesty, and humility, yourattainment will be accelerated and enriched immeasurably."},{"pageContent":"20 THE FORMULAS OF L.V.X. AND N.O.X.The magical ‘formulas’ of L.V.X. and N.O.X. are frequently discussed in thecontext of the Thelemic magical path. As you may know, these terms translate as“light” and “night”, respectively. There has been quite a bit ofmisunderstanding, or at least misplaced emphasis, when it comes to these terms.This chapter will attempt to clarify the picture. The opinions I am offeringhere are based on my own experience, and that of my colleagues and students overthe years. Nothing here should be taken as doctrine, but merely as theconsidered opinions of someone who has walked the path. I encourage yourskepticism and your own personal research, as always.It is, in some ways, easier to explain and to understand L.V.X. and N.O.X. bystarting at the end-point of the path of attainment, and working backwardstoward the beginning. Let’s start by asking ourselves, what is the ultimate goalof the path? Most of us will likely agree that it is union with God, union withthe All, immersion in the infinite, the attainment of supernal cosmicconsciousness, or some similar concept. In the system of A∴A∴, one of thesymbolic frameworks that most vibrantly and viscerally conveys the essence ofthis attainment is the dissolution of oneself into the grail of Babalon—thegreat holy grail of the sphere of Binah. This dissolution constitutes theadept’s attainment to the 8°=3[images/00025.jpg] grade of A∴A∴, known asMagister Templi. Now, if we are going to offer all of ourselves, our entiresense of identity and consciousness, into the grail, it follows that we have toknow ourselves completely. It is a prerequisite to this attainment that we havefully actualized who we are, otherwise the offering is meaningless. As iswritten in Liber Cheth, “Thou shalt mingle thy life with the universal life.Thou shalt keep not back one drop.” For this self-understanding to be complete,we must have attained the sphere of Chesed and the Adeptus Exemptus7°=4[images/00025.jpg] grade in A∴A∴. This grade signifies the fully realized,maximally functioning ruach.Now, still moving backwards: to actualize this perfected ruach/ego, we must haveattained K & C of the HGA, thereby catching a glimpse of that star at ourcenter, and gaining knowledge of the True Will. The K & C begins the process ofdeepening our relationship to the Angel, in order that we may fully realize ourlives as an outward expression of our True Will (Adeptus Major6°=5[images/00025.jpg]) and thereby eventually attain to Adeptus Exemptus.And moving even further backwards: in order to attain K & C of the HGA, we musthave previously equilibrated ourselves in terms of the elements of our being, byvirtue of passing through the elemental grades and the corresponding balancingordeals of the First Order of A∴A∴. We must have moved through Malkuth, Yesod,Hod, Netzach to the grade of Dominus Liminis, affecting a synthesis andharmonization of all these elements into a suitable vessel for the light of theHoly Guardian Angel.So we’ve moved from the supreme attainment of supernal consciousness backwardsto the very beginning of the path. Now let’s reverse direction, starting at thebeginning, and discuss how we are likely to experience these transformativestages as we move through them, beginning with the formula of L.V.X.You’ve probably heard about L.V.X. mostly in the context of the old HermeticOrder of the Golden Dawn, where this is a formula of their Tiphereth attainment.If you review the original ‘Analysis of the Keyword,’ which is a part of theLesser Ritual of the Hexagram as published in Liber O and elsewhere, you’ll seethat the formula of L.V.X. is intertwined with the so-called ‘dying god’ formulathat for the most part has been associated with the old aeon of Osiris. In theoriginal Golden Dawn, the L.V.X. formula was connected with Tiphereth and wasthe symbol of the crowning achievement of their First Order. It symbolized acertain awakening consciousness in the new adept, but it by no means reflectedthe full attainment of the K & C of the HGA as understood in the system of theA∴A∴. I’ll say more about this important distinction later in the chapter.In the A∴A∴, the formula of L.V.X. is the process of seeking the light of theHoly Guardian Angel—an entirely valid formula that was overlaid with the formulaof the dying god in its old aeonic manifestation, but isn’t necessarilyidentical with it. That ‘one star in sight’ from the beginning of the path, thelight of the Angel, is the L.V.X. we seek, along with the resultingself-knowledge and self-empowerment. As we move through the First Order gradesof A∴A∴ the L.V.X. formula manifests itself as a process akin to the alchemicalformula of solve et coagula, which is the dissolution of each of our componentparts, and then later synthesizing them. Accordingly, the day-to-day experienceof an initiate of these grades is often necessarily one of partialconsciousness, corresponding to their particular stage of growth. For example,at Malkuth in the grade of Neophyte there is a great deal of emphasis on thephysical body and the material universe. Later at the Zelator/Yesod we see afocus on the subconscious processes; at the grade of Hod we work extensivelywith the intellect; and at the grade of Netzach with our desire, emotion andaspiration. These are all simply parts of the one holistic self, of course, butit is sometimes useful to view ourselves in terms of our component parts, forthe sake of purifying and consecrating these aspects of self to be increasinglyin accord with our True Will, thereby reformulating the entirety the self to bea vessel for the Angel.When we are in a particular grade, and are therefore focused on these partialrealities, we may feel somewhat unbalanced, especially when diverging from themiddle pillar grades. Yet this temporary imbalance is a necessary part of theeventual harmonization. If we merely work to enhance those things that make usmost feel comfortable and balanced, we leave large portions of ourselvesundeveloped both psychologically and magically. Crowley addresses this with hisvarious warnings about the dangers of simply pandering to one’s preferences, asopposed to developing those aspects of self that are more shadowy—disowned ordisliked. We must compensate for these prejudices by training these lessdeveloped and less desirable aspects of self.You will recall our metaphor from an earlier chapter, that we constructourselves as a grail for the light of the HGA. You will also recall thepotential pitfalls of this process—a grail that has a hole in it will leak; agrail that is lopsided will topple; a grail that is made out of the wrongmaterial may be dissolved by the light or contaminate it. Eventually, when thisgrail is completed through the passage of the elemental grades, we offerourselves in a receptive state to the light of the Angel. As we read in LiberLXV, “to await Thee is the end, not the beginning.” Indeed, the formula ofL.V.X. is central to the passage through the elemental grades and is intimatelyconnected with the attainment of the K & C of the HGA.If the First Order grades are a courtship, and the K & C is the wedding, thenthe grades of Adeptus Major (6°=5[images/00025.jpg]) and Adeptus Exemptus(7°=4[images/00025.jpg]) embody the task of strengthening and deepening themarital relationship. Here, the adept’s intimacy with the HGA is solidified, andhis or her life is conformed to be an ever more perfect vessel of the True Will.Beginning at this stage, there is a gradual transition of focus onto the N.O.X.formula, although the L.V.X. formula remains in force as well; after all, it isthe formula of the Tiphereth attainment, and the newly minted adept is freshfrom the K & C. The transition from 5°=6[images/00025.jpg] to6°=5[images/00025.jpg] requires a transformation of the outer life of the adeptinto a vessel for the True Will. Relationships, career, and potentiallyeverything else in the outer life as well as the personalities as we know it isthe field of operation of the light of the Angel; and we’ll find much of thisreconfigured, reconstructed, and sometimes blasted apart and put back togetherin uniquely interesting ways as we proceed.At this stage there tends to be an increasing awareness of an endpoint to thispersonal development; that is, the individual consciousness we are continuing tobuild, enhance and balance—the ruach-consciousness that is interacting with theAngel—is only finitely expandable. To go beyond the limitations of the ruachthere is, literally, nothing left for the adept besides the transition to theN.O.X. formula.The attainment to 7°=4[images/00025.jpg] signifies this fully realized ruachconsciousness—the human psyche (as normally understood) in its most exaltedmanifestation. It is only at this stage, when we have finally and fully come toknow ourselves in all our aspects, that we are finally able to offer all ofourselves into the grail. How could we possibly have done this before? It wouldhave been a partial offering. It would be like cutting off one of our fingersand offering it into the grail saying, “Here, Babalon, I give you everything!”when in fact we have hardly even begun to know how to offer all of ourselves.Furthermore, the attainment of the Night of Pan, the All, the dissolution in thegrail, requires us to recognize ourselves as nothing but a vessel for universalwill. This is one reason for the association of the name Nemo (‘No Man’) withthe grade of Magister Templi at Binah. There is no place for a human being inthat place, because all that one is has been given up. It should be noted thatwe can’t know what is ‘beyond ourselves’ at this stage. We simply know that weare a finite being that must be offered up. Therefore, any consciousness (i.e.‘light’) beyond this will appear dark to us. So in one sense, N.O.X. is lightthat is too bright or too refined to be perceived by the ruach in its normalstate. This darkness is not in fact absence of light but a qualitativedifference in the nature of the light as we perceive it. The name Pan, meaning‘all,’ enumerates to 210, which is also the valuation of the letters N.O.X. So,the Night of Pan is the night of All, and the All is the transrational andtranspersonal, the starry night beyond the sun (i.e. our attainment ofTiphereth.) The perception of our own interior star has evolved; the star thathas been in our sight from the beginning is now seen as simply one star in thecompany of stars in the heavens, and we offer it freely and joyously into thegrail.I mentioned earlier in the chapter that there is often misplaced emphasis in theinterpretation of L.V.X. and N.O.X. The first of these misconceptions is theidea that L.V.X. is a path of ‘good’ and other-serving, whereas N.O.X. is ‘evil’or self-serving—basically the traditional dualistic attributions of light anddarkness as good and evil. If you consider everything I’ve said so far aboutthese formulas and the way they fold into the path of attainment, it should beclear that we’re not talking about good and evil here. We’re talking aboutstages of attainment and the specific formulas that unlock those stages ofattainment.Another misconception I encounter fairly frequently is the conflation of theL.V.X. formula with the old aeon formula of the dying god. The L.V.X. formulasimply involves seeking the light within us. In the old aeon, this process wasprojected on to the idea of an external redeemer, the god who dies for us andembodies (by projection) the Neshamah or superconsciousness. In the new aeon,however, we can now understand this as an extension of self. There is no reasonwhy the L.V.X. formula must be linked to the dying god myth in its old aeonicform. In the new aeon, we see that we can redeem ourselves, with each moment adeath of the old and a rebirth into the new. We are as a child born anew intoeach moment, via transformation of our consciousness. The redemption here is notfrom sin, but from the delusion of mortality. It is redemption from theabsorption in the physical world and the apparent finality of death; anawareness of deathlessness, the principal of immortality resident in each of us;that solar divine being in our core – our star or khabs. It is a redemption thatallows us to have an increasing ability to identify with the star within as thecenter of our being rather than the limited ego-personality in which we haveimprisoned ourselves through our lack of full self-awareness. It enables usconsciously to place the neshamah on its throne as the rightful ruler of bothruach and nephesh, with no need for ‘external’ divine aid.The L.V.X. formula still holds immense power when understood and employed inlight of these new aeon truths. For example, there are several Thelema-based,Golden Dawn-patterned orders (including the Temple of the Silver Star) that haverevamped their presentation of the old Adeptus Minor ritual from the Golden Dawnto reflect these new aeon realities, with very powerful results. In some suchadaptations, the symbolic lesson is that we are not bound to an old aeon crossof passive self-sacrifice but to the cross of the elements, showing our masteryof the formula of the pentagram. Furthermore, I think it’s important toemphasize that the L.V.X. formula reaches its climax in the attainment ofTiphereth, yet it does so without denigrating the importance of the furtherattainment of Binah. It simply recognizes Tiphereth as the pinnacle of one stageof development.In closing, it is very important to note that in the A∴A∴, the L.V.X. formulafunctions on a different level than that in Golden Dawn-based outer orders. Inthese systems, the attainment of Tiphereth is in the world of Yetzirah,signified by incrementally deepened knowledge of the True Will, and a morevibrant connection with that solar center at our core, but there’s still muchwork to do. This is not equivalent to Knowledge and Conversation of the HolyGuardian Angel, which is the nature of the Tiphereth attainment in the A∴A∴. Inthe A∴A∴, the K & C actualizes the attainment of Tiphereth in the world ofBriah, and this marks the beginning of willed and fully conscious connectionbetween the Briatic and Yetziratic worlds. Here the adept consciouslyexperiences the supernal spiritual reality impinging itself on the ruach. Thisis in marked contrast to the pre-adept stage where superconsciousnesscommunicates chiefly though the nephesh—through intuitions, dreams and othersymbolic content, filtered through the personal unconscious. Likewise, thefurther attainment of Binah represents our ascension to the consciousness ofBinah of Atziluth. There is an inward and upward progress through the fourworlds as well as the sephiroth on the Tree of Life.I recognize that much of the material in this chapter has been heavier on theorythan much of the rest of the book. It is my hope, however, that you will be ableto use the theory here to inform your own practice. Most importantly, I haveattempted to give you a glimpse of the nature of the changes in consciousnessthat await you along the path toward mastery. To that end, I will close with abrief guided meditation that summarizes these transformations of consciousness.EXERCISE:Perform preliminary relaxation practices, and regularize the breath. Then allowthe following phrases to arise in your mind, and spend a few moments meditatingon the doctrine of each sephiroth before moving on to the next. You may wish torecord yourself reading these phrases, and perform the meditation while playingback your recording; or simply refer to the version I recorded as a part of theLiving Thelema podcast segment called “Advice from the Tree of Life.”MalkuthI live in the physical world. I have a body with which I may experience thisworld and all its sensory wonders and pleasures. My senses are the eyes and earsof the Universe, and through my life, the Universe witnesses and experiencesitself. Yet, I am not my body.YesodI see past the veil of matter to perceive the astral patterns underlying thephysical world. The life power flows through me, as the force of my Willexpressing itself in the boundless and ever-changing patterns of the unconsciousMind. I wield the life power in service of my own evolution, and in service tothe evolution of humanity. Yet, I am not my Mind; and I am not my astral body.HodI possess an intellect with which I build conscious thoughts as Cups of Form, togive shape to the liquid of magical Force. I use reason and mental discipline toorganize myself and my life in service of the Will. Yet, I am not my Intellect.NetzachI possess emotions as a fuel for aspiration and a medium for love. My soulyearns for the Divine, and I enflame myself in prayer as I aspire to Union withThat which is beyond. Yet, I am not my emotions; and I am not my aspiration.TipharethThe Light of the Holy Guardian Angel shines on the center of my being, fromwhich I instruct and direct all the parts of myself toward their Right Function.This Center of Consciousness serves as the Prophet of the Holy Guardian Angel,whose Voice is the True Will. Yet, I am more than this Center of Consciousness.GeburahMy Will is an extension of Universal Will, and I construct my inner and outerlife to be a perfect Form for its expression. The Power of all Life is availableto me in every moment. Yet, I am more than my Will.ChesedI have consciousness of the path of my soul, in the many lives I have livedbefore this one, and I govern my consciousness in the light of this knowledge. Istrive, in all things, to live fully as an expression of the Highest Light. Yet,I am more than this.BinahI have full consciousness of the Grail of Holy Blood, into which the droplets ofmy individual lives have fallen, for I am that Grail. I have mingled myindividual life with the Universal Life, and let go of all attachments of thesmall ego. I tend to the garden of my lower self, with love and care. I receivethe Word and give it birth. Yet, I am beyond the Grail.ChokmahI bear the Word—the primal impulse of all the life of humanity. I am theUniversal Will, all-powerful and infallible—the Lance that is plunged into theGrail of All. Yet, I am beyond the Lance and beyond the Word.KetherI am the One Source, from which all things proceed, and to which all return. Iam No-Thing, yet in me is the potential for All Things that can exist. I am thePrimal Point that Sees every possibility, yet Knows the Unity of All. I AM."},{"pageContent":"21 THE RIGHT USE OF MAGICAL POWER33 [index_split_045.html#filepos661155]The magical path is inherently a path to power. The nature of this power, itspotencies and its dangers, has been the subject of much debate and discussion,yet I believe at least one principle is fundamental: the effective, constructiveand humane application of this power requires a balanced magician. The aspiringmagician is confronted with conflicting, and potentially derailing, notions ofpower from the start. The magical path itself challenges the aspirant toharmonize these power drives with an ever-increasing conscience, rooted in will;a conscience which guides the magician toward the right use of his or her power.Without detracting from the correct view of the Great Work as the union ofmicrocosm with macrocosm, we can alternately express its ‘5 united with 6’ as aunion of power (5, the pentagram, the Mars force, Geburah), with the centralemblem of harmony and beauty (6, the hexagram, the divinely-inspired ruach,Tiphereth).In this chapter, I will explore the keys to the use of this magical power. Inparticular, I will focus on the training that leads the aspirant to theattainment of Tiphereth, and the subsequent work of the newly made adept as heor she works the paths above Tiphereth, establishing the balance of beauty andstrength so essential to the execution of the True Will.{N.B.: My discussion of the sephiroth and paths refers primarily to the progressof an aspirant of A∴A∴, but would be equally applicable, at a different level ofintensity, to those working the corresponding degrees of the Temple of theSilver Star or similar orders patterned on the Tree of Life, or even an entirelysolitary path formulated along these lines.}Any discussion of magical power is likely to draw our attention to the energyoften called the ‘Mars force,’ also known as kundalini, the life-power, andvarious other names in analogous traditions. On the Tree of Life, the Mars forceis primarily represented by the sephira Geburah. This sephira is the fifth insequence from Kether, thus formulating the pentagram, itself a symbol of magicalpower. In addition to its attribution to Mars, Geburah is the seat of thepersonal will, and a linkage point to that universal will impinging upon it fromthe supernals, specifically Chokmah. In contemplating the Tree of Life, this isthe most easily visible key to the source and right use of magical power: Theentirety of the personal will, that aspect of the ruach the magician has(rightly) deemed to be individual and unique, is merely an individualizedexpression of the universal will which it serves. With this truth in mind, wecan examine the aspiring magician’s approach to Geburah from the sephirothbelow.> > > Verily destruction is the foundation of existence,> > > And the tearing-down thou seest> > > Is but the assembling of material> > > For a grander structure.> > > > > (The Book of Tokens, from “The Meditation on Peh”)> > > Break down the fortress of thine Individual Self,> > > that thy Truth may spring free from the ruins.> > > > > (The Book of Thoth, from the discussion of the Tower Atu)Long before the magician attains to the full magical power of Geburah, s/he mustface the trials of the sephiroth and paths beneath Tiphereth, balancing the fourelements within him or herself. The keystone of this pre-Tiphereth training, interms of the relationship to magical power, is the work of the path of peh. Herethe magician’s first encounter with the force of planetary Mars is also his orher first crossing of a “reciprocal” path on the Tree, as the path of pehconnects the intellect of Hod with the desire and aspiration of Netzach. Anotherimplication of this arrangement is that the intellect is consciously applied inorder to choose and define the object of the Desire of Netzach. The right use ofaspiration and pure desire (Netzach) is achieved by the intellectualapprehension (Hod) of the appropriate goal. The completed work of Malkuth,Yesod, and their related paths is now balanced by peh, just as the magical forceis simultaneously “stepped up” a notch with the increased activity of theSvadisthana chakra, to which peh is attributed. Indeed, the magician’s growingpower is automatically held in check by the balance inherent in the Tree. Evenat this early stage of development, balance is the key to power.Furthermore, the passage of the path of peh is a safeguard against the powerdrive taking a predominant role in the advance toward Tiphereth. One who questsafter the Angel with the main goal of increasing his personal egoic power isblocked from true mastery of this path. For the nature of the path itself (seenin the Tower Atu) is the overturning of such ideas, which bind, confuse andotherwise subvert direct apprehension of the true order of the universe. Thepassage of the path of peh thus purifies and consecrates the aspirant’s magicalpower at the microcosmic level, preparing him or her for the eventual attainmentof increased power at Tiphereth in a safe and constructive manner. The manyexamples of tyrannical behavior seen in socio-political history and in ourpresent times would seem to be evidence of the dangers of misperceived andmisapplied personal power. In these cases, we see that the power drive is usedas an exercise of personal dominance, or alternately, the aggressive anddestructive impulses are projected onto the “other” (person, country,racial/ethnic group, “enemy”), as a rationalization for our own intolerance andaggression.The ordeal of the path of peh being accomplished, the magician strives onwardtoward Tiphereth, the one visible goal at this stage of the work. The approachto Tiphereth is guarded by two additional paths, both Mars-related, whichimpinge on the development of magical power in the aspirant: ayin (The Devil)and nun (Death). The ordeal of the path of ayin (Capricorn, in which Mars isexalted) includes the development of the consciousness of the transcendent,divine realities behind the appearance of ‘evil.’ As long as we continue toproject the dualistic ideas of good and evil onto the world, we are unable todevelop the tools for responsible use of our own power. These tools include theability to refine our conscience, in accordance with the True Will, such thatour exercise of power is truly in service to the world around us. Knee-jerkjudgments of others, and the resulting dualistic thought and behavior patterns,tend to steer us toward one-sided use of power, typically to diminish our egoicdiscomfort with those things we have labeled as evil!The ordeal of the path of nun (Scorpio, ruled by Mars) requires a similarlyuncomfortable task, from the perspective of the ego-personality: the surrenderto a ‘higher’ authority, and letting go of the illusion of ego-mastery. In otherwords, we face the death of the ‘I’ we have worked so hard to cultivatethroughout our lives up to this point. Here again are keys to the right use ofpower—as long as we cling to the ego, our actions are driven by the fear(pachad, a name of Geburah/Mars) of losing our identity and autonomy. We attackthose things which threaten us in this way, expending valuable energy in theprocess.Upon the full attainment of Tiphereth with the Knowledge and Conversation of theHoly Guardian Angel, the adept is centered and balanced in this higherillumination—the King is bathed in the light descending from the crown. Therelationship between adept and Angel has just begun, however, and takes effortand time to grow. The central tasks of the new adept are to strive to deepen thecommunion with the Angel, to further refine his or her ability to receive andinterpret its instructions, and to effect a right balance in the psyche betweenthe human ego and its new superconscious contact-point. That is, the Adept mustadapt his or her ruach to operate in a fluid fashion given the breakthrough ofthe Briatic consciousness (neshamah). Fortunately, this trail has already beenblazed for us: the methods are clearly spelled out in the tasks of the paths ofmem and lamed, and they lead the way to the full attainment of magical power atGeburah.> > > For even as He abideth in the thick darkness and in the> > > blinding light, in the elements, in the planets, and in the> > > mighty circle of the Heavens, even so shall I abide…> > > > > (Liber Siloam sub figura CDLI)> > > Absorb thyself in this Great Sea of the Waters of Life.> > > Dive deep in it until thou hast lost thyself.> > > And having lost thyself,> > > Then shalt thou find thyself again,> > > And shalt be one with me,> > > Thy Lord and King.> > > Thus shalt thou learn the secret> > > Of the restoration of the King unto his throne.> > > > > (The Book of Tokens, from “The Meditation on Mem”)The path of mem represents the influx of the strength of Geburah into thereflective waters of the human intellect of Hod. While the aspiring magicianencountered the influence of this path at Hod, it is only after the attainmentof Tiphereth that the path is worked in full. In the A∴A∴ curriculum, the taskof this path is the attainment of the state known as the ‘Sleep of Siloam’—ablissful, peaceful union of adept and Angel. This attainment reinforces thecentral lesson of the path of mem: the adept now knows, without a doubt, thathis or her true master is the Holy Guardian Angel. His ego is now positioned asthe figure in the Hanged Man Atu—overturned, and receptive to the directinfluence of the master’s light. It seems appropriately paradoxical that thisfirst path leading directly unto the power of Geburah from “below” is one ofego-humility and receptivity—the very traits that will allow the adept to wieldhis newfound power with deep conscience and vision. That is, these newlydiscovered potencies will serve the universal will, particularized as theconsciously realized True Will of the Adept, rather than nepheshic drives or thewhims of the small ego.> > > This is again a hieroglyph of “Love is the law, love under> > > will”.

This path reflects a truth with which the adeptof Tiphereth is doubtlessly growing very familiar: his or her every thought,word and deed exact precise and unremitting consequences. It is an oft-noteddictum of the Great Work that the further the aspirant travels along the path,the less “elasticity” s/he finds when inadvertently deviating from it. InMalkuth, the aspirant might never even notice such deviations, but furtherprogress in the work brings more immediate (and sharp!) reminders from theuniverse whenever there is a sidestep. It is an arguable point whether thisfeedback mechanism is due to some universal principle (so-called ‘karma’ etal.), increased sensitivity to inner promptings, or some combination of both.In any case, the path of lamed, in the form of the Adjustment Atu portrays thesekarmic laws in action. This path, the direct linkage between the power ofGeburah and the beauty and harmony of Tiphereth, displays the balance of thesepotencies which is necessary for their right use. This right use is then, bydefinition, in accord with the laws of nature, and with the True Will of theadept, given voice by his or her Angel.> > > Remember that unbalanced force is evil; that unbalanced> > > severity is but cruelty and oppression; but that also unbalanced> > > mercy is but weakness which would allow and abet Evil.> > > > > (Liber Librae sub figura XXX)Recommended Reading:Case, P.

The word conjures images of medieval sages, laboring in darklaboratories filled with arcane scientific apparati, striving to transform leadinto gold. Medieval alchemical literature discusses procedures for separationand combination; the application of heat and distillation; the principles ofdecay and regeneration. In many cases, these texts appear purely practical innature, expanding the boundaries of what was the cutting-edge science of thetime. Yet, from the standpoint of modern depth psychology, we can see thetransformation of physical substances as a metaphor for a process of innerchange. Simple contemplation of such a physical change process brings us insympathy with it, even if its apparent object is entirely outside ourselves.Accordingly, we may conclude that the medieval alchemists were themselves theprima material of the working.The metallurgical and chemical experiments of the medieval alchemists were onthe frontiers of intellectual exploration in Europe at that time; at the fertileboundary between the light of knowledge and the dark mystery of the unknown. Atthis crossroads all things seem possible, and the mind is made open to what isotherwise hidden or disguised. The great questions and quests of humankind areprojected upon the infinite expanse of possibility at this meeting place of theknown and the unknown. They are framed in the language of the science which hasbrought them to that point.Let us, then, propose a more specific definition of alchemy: alchemy is theScience and Art of transforming consciousness. Its vocabulary is born out of thecutting-edge theories and unanswered questions on the frontiers of science. Itscentral method is the extraction of meaning from mystery, through the lens ofpsychological projection.Science has moved on since medieval times, for better or for worse. Thepurification, transformation, and production of metals are now performed on avast scale in thousands of factories and mills. Science now fronts against theunknown in a multitude of modern fields, including physics, biology, computerscience and psychology. If we accept that ancient alchemists were performinginner transformations using contemporary, state-of-the-art tools as ametaphorical projection screen, doesn’t it follow that true modern alchemistswould do the same? If so, we must look to the frontiers of today’s science forthese modern alchemical tools. If alchemy is truly the science and art ofextracting meaning from mystery, by way of psychological projections, only themysteries of today’s unanswered questions will present us with a projectionscreen of sufficient size.Lawrence M. Principe is a chemist and historian of science at Johns HopkinsUniversity. Some years ago, he was a co-organizer of a conference at theChemical Heritage Foundation in Philadelphia, which collects archival materialrelated to alchemy and other chemical sciences.

Humanity was on the threshold ofdiscovering the underlying principles of matter, the facts of its nature, andthe laws of its combination and action. And yet, while on the quest for thisfactual knowledge, they touched on many governing principles of the mind and thesoul. Just as humanity was coming to terms with its ability to create and definereality, its divine birthright, these truths were echoed in the frontiers of itsscience.My propositions in this present discussion apply to humanity as a whole. It hasalways been the case, across the course of human evolution, that mystics andother extraordinary seekers are the droplets on the crest of the wave ofprogress, and reach their conclusions long before the critical mass of humanity.What I’m discussing here, on the contrary, is a much broader process. It is theevolution of collective human consciousness, played out on the field ofpsychological projections onto the frontiers of scientific inquiry. Theunanswered mysteries of contemporary science become the hooks on which oursociety (usually unconsciously) hangs its aspirations, ideals and fears, itsquestions about the mysteries of life, and its strivings for meaning andunderstanding. By this definition, we are all alchemists.The Nature of Psychological ProjectionsLet’s begin with a discussion of the projection process itself. The Jungianmodel of consciousness is fundamentally a psychology of dynamic energy. Thehuman psyche is composed of interweaving energy patterns, which tend to clusteraround certain basic thought-forms. These include the concepts of “self,” “God,”“other,” “I” (the ego), and so on. The ability of the psyche to move anddischarge energy between these constituent parts is essential to its health. Theego tends to be a stumbling block to the free flow of this energy, however. Itseeks to maintain the illusion of autonomy and sovereignty, and accordingly,certain ideas, images, and emotions become repressed or otherwise restricted,forming what is known as the shadow. Unacceptable ideas are diverted into formswhich are less threatening to the ego. For example: Some aspect of our deepconscience observes that we are often cruel to others. Yet, this fact isunacceptable to the ego—it doesn’t want to be challenged on its bad behavior.This “judging” aspect of ourselves—this channel of energy—still needs to flowsomewhere. The target of this flow often turns out to be another person who isobserved behaving cruelly. The “judge” gets to proclaim guilt, and the ego getsto pretend it is just a bystander in the trial, taking satisfaction in thecondemnation of the evildoer.Such negative emotions are not the only candidates for projection, however. Jungpointedly and repeatedly emphasized that there is “gold” in the shadow. We alsoproject our deepest loves, our dearest hopes, our most exquisite ideas of beautyand transcendence, onto the world around us, because we are often unable toaccept these qualities as aspects of ourselves. All that is required is theimpulse toward energy flow, and a suitable object for the projection. If we arealienated from our own strength, we project it onto a movie hero. If we feelincomplete, we project the idea of a perfect partner onto a desired romanticinterest. And….if we cannot accept our own divinity, and we feel lost on thepath to finding ourselves, we project the entirety of the spiritual journey, andits destination, onto a myth.Some of these myths are now known to us as such, because to a great extent, wehave evolved past the need for them, or their particular symbols have lost theirhold on us. For example, we can look back at the great Greek myths of Herculesand without too much struggle, we see it as a myth created by a societystruggling to come to terms with its own strength, and mastery of itsenvironment. These myths are more perceptible to us precisely because we have adistanced perspective on them—the distance of aeons of time, and correspondingcultural evolution. On the other hand, we rarely perceive the myths we arecurrently living. We tend to be conscious only of the myths that have completedtheir transformative work upon us. Accordingly, if we want to understand ourcurrent transformational patterns, we must try to discover the living myths oftoday’s world—the things we actually believe in—and the gods we truly worship.These alone have the numinosity—the spiritual power—required for our alchemy.For medieval alchemists, the tools and methodologies of the physical scienceshad this power. That is, they projected their path of transformation onto thisparticular screen—a myth about the power of certain tools and processes tocreate miraculous changes in matter. This projection “worked” because there wasenough ambiguity about the actual answers to their questions to fire theircreative imagination—to keep them reaching for the next mystery.The Mystery Projection> > > > > The invisible world can be a dangerous place if approached improperly,> > > > > without the necessary preparation and commitment to the process.

We can become conscious of these projections, but moreoften we engage in them blindly, because we have found no better language withwhich to address our inner problem. The next stage of our inner evolutiondoesn’t yet have a frame, a language, a science of its own. It needs a “hook” onwhich it can hang in order to know itself. I call this the mystery projection.For our purposes here, it doesn’t matter whether the medieval alchemists knewthe true nature of their work. Perhaps some did; probably many did not. Thosewho did not understand the true nature of their work unconsciously developed alanguage of transformation accessible to others. Those few who did understandwere simply a few steps ahead—they realized the psycho-spiritual value of thelanguage and continued to use it as a veil for the deeper meaning they haddiscovered.The equivalent situation in the modern scientific world, for example, would beon the one hand the quantum physicist whose conscious interest is exploring thepatterns of probability of light passing through tiny slits in a plate, or onthe other hand his colleague, who goes home at night to ponder the significanceof probability waves as an existential question. If we are locked into amaterialist, reductionist viewpoint, we are simply “doing physical science.” If,on the other hand, we are ready for a deeper relationship with the process, itwill present itself as such.Ilya Prigogine, a 1977 Nobel laureate, writes:> > > > > The basis of the vision of classical physics was the conviction that> > > > > the future is determined by the present, and therefore a careful study> > > > > of the present permits an unveiling of the future.

Myths are the dreams of a culture,and these myths are the field onto which we project our quests forunderstanding, our strivings for spiritual insight, and our deepest fears of theunknown.Founding Myths and Mystery Projections in Modern ScienceI was assisted in my research for this article by Science magazine’s 125thanniversary series entitled, “125 questions: What we don’t know.” This seriessurveyed the current frontiers of scientific knowledge in a number of fields,and highlighted the unanswered questions driving cutting-edge research. Myresearch was admittedly (and intentionally) a superficial survey on my part ofthe scientific disciplines discussed in Science. While I was conducting myinitial research for this article, a friend of mine remarked that my researchmight require in-depth knowledge of a great number of diverse scientific fields.I replied that I would use my naïveté in service of the project, since theprojection process itself requires just such an attitude. That is, we areconfronted with the unknown, and we attempt to fill in the gaps. The gaps thenbecome the projective canvas for the psyche (individual and collective) toreveal itself. A sophisticated practitioner of any of these sciences would,quite obviously, have important insights into these matters. However, ourpresent avenue of inquiry requires a more distanced “layperson” to perceive thepatterns at work. A microscope would give us details about the flecks of painton a work of Picasso, but we don’t really see the painting until we stand back afew paces. What is missing from the microscope’s minutely detailed “expertise”is naïvely creative imagination. An adult looks to the sky and sees clusters ofwhite water vapor, whereas a child sees dragons.Working along similar lines, musician Brian Eno uses intentional limitation,chance, and technical naïveté to encourage a certain innocence to enter hismusic. These factors may force us to take a novel approach to situations. We’reoff guard, uncertain, and unable to rely on habit and routine. In other words:we are alive and alert, thinking and feeling our way through a problem, a mazeor a mystery. I attempted to maintain this sort of mindset as I researched andwrote this article, and I encourage the reader to do the same whilecontemplating its content.Let us, then, examine a variety of modern scientific disciplines in light of thetheses described above. For each science, I will attempt to determine the“founding myths” implied by the state of the frontiers of the particularscience, and extract the mystery projection operative within the context of themyths. When I was reviewing the material from these various disciplines, I oftenused a set of “mystery questions” to stimulate and identify my own projections.For example:> • “I wish we knew the answer to this question, because then we could…”> • “If only we could discover X, then…”> • “That fact (a scientific discovery) is amazing, because….”> • “I never thought humans would be able to…”> • “We shouldn’t mess with X. It’s dangerous because….”You may wish to do the same as you read the following sections, to stimulateyour own projection process.It is important to note that this brief survey is purely speculative. That is, Ido not assert that the scientific findings described here are valid because theyreflect esoteric doctrines, nor am I attempting to validate esoteric doctrinesby virtue of scientific discoveries. My aim is merely to elucidate theprojection process which is active in any culture exploring its scientificfrontiers. So, let us stand back a bit, de-focus our eyes, and maybe, justmaybe, we can perceive the mystery behind the science, and behold the dragonsinstead of the clouds.Biology/GeneticsOne of the simplest and best known examples of a projection onto biologicalmysteries is the evolving theory of human illness. Any study of history oranthropology will reveal various cultures’ priest-shaman-physicians, and theirbelief that demons or other evil spirits were the cause of illness. Today, ofcourse, we place the blame on bacteria and viruses. The thresholds of knowledgeare different, as are the tools of science used, and the language employed, butthe mystery projection is the same: invisible forces are at work. They attackus, and attempt to kill us. We need specialized help to rid ourselves of them.What are these forces? How can we stop them? To whom do I appeal for aid?Many of the great modern biological questions revolve around of the potency ofDNA as creator, transformer, preserver of who and what we are as humans. Thoughstill consciously conceived of as a biological question regarding a physicalsubstance (i.e. the founding myth of modern genetics), the mystery projectionreveals a deeper level of meaning. Through our projections of transformativepower onto the physical substance of DNA, we contemplate and investigate our owndivine, creative power, and by extension, our role in the transformation ofhumanity itself.Our growing understanding of the genetic determinants underlying our existenceinevitably reveals the mystery projection-questions: What forces shape andchange us? What in our lives can we consciously control? What are the limits ofour personal power in affecting our circumstances? What is fated and immutable?Clearly, though we sought to understand the influence of the physical buildingblocks of life, we have stumbled into a contemplation of destiny vs. free will.In examining our relationship to other animals, modern genetic research isinvestigating the question of what makes us uniquely human. Here, ourprojections carry us toward the contemplation of the central existential mysteryof what it means to be human and, by extension, of the meaning of life itself.Carl Jung once remarked that we will never know what is unique about humanconsciousness until we encounter non-human consciousness.39[index_split_045.html#filepos662243] He was referring to the possibility ofeventual contact with extra-terrestrial intelligence, but the logic cancertainly be applied to the comparative genetic research already underway.In addition to the burgeoning field of genetics, modern biology is pursuingfascinating questions concerning the biological basis of consciousness. In ourattempt to discover the “seat of the soul” within our physical brain, we comeface to face with the mystery of the mind. The mystery projection here: What’sbehind the veil of matter? It is not uncommon, in our daily lives, to note thatthere seems to be more to “us” than a mere collection of cells and organs. Butnow, with the advent of modern biological research techniques, we appear to beon the threshold of actually discovering the physical basis of such experiences.The astute reader will likely note that similar ‘discovery thresholds’ havealways characterized scientific progress—and that is precisely my point! Thefeeling of being almost there—that sense of the mystery being just barely out ofreach—is the fundamental fuel for the fires of projection. It is the anticipatedecstasy of discovery that keeps the quest alive, regardless of the scientificmethodologies employed. Medieval alchemists sought the “soul” of a substance ina purified distillate or a powdered residue. Today, we seek the soul in tinyneuronal webs. These are indeed “merely” projections—but projections which arealive with the promise of magic and meaning.Some scientists seem to straddle the apparent abyss between science andmysticism quite openly. Biologist Rupert Sheldrake, for example, has put forthhis theory of “morphogenetic fields.” This theory includes something akin to a“radio transmitter” model of species development over time—no less than abiological construct explaining the transmission of archetypes. Sheldrake positsthat a species develops not only due to its current environment and physicallytransmitted DNA encoding, but also due to the traces of past experience. As anillustration, he notes that if we were ignorant of the electro-mechanicalprinciples of a radio, we would hear it and conclude that nothing is added to itwhen it is playing music—the music doesn’t make it heavier—yet it is in factreceiving something, and that something defines its behavior and its nature atany given moment. In this line of thought, Sheldrake is reaching for facts andlanguage to express the mystery of the archetypes of consciousness. Thephysiological truth of this theory is not our concern here. Instead, we areinterested in the theoretical gymnastics Sheldrake undertakes in his attempt tonavigate the mystery threshold—in other words, his alchemy. His work is aprojection onto the mysteries of our origins, and the question of why any givenperson takes the form they do. It also parallels the theories of quantum physicspositing that non-proximal objects affect each other across space-time—theprinciple of non-locality.A final example of modern alchemy being conducted in the biological fields isthe science of aging. Researchers in this field consciously explore the foundingmyth that the body is a machine that breaks down over time—a process that canperhaps be slowed, stopped, or even reversed. Clearly, these researchers are themodern equivalent of the ancient explorers who sought the fountain of youth—aprojection of the deeper search for transcendence of bodily limitations andphysical human life. This particular example is instructive in that it shows ushow the same mystery projection can be applied to different sciences indifferent eras—only the tools have changed. In the Era of Exploration, theprojection was onto the idea of a physical source of the powers of immortality,for the process of geographical discovery was capturing the world’s imagination.Now, in the era of DNA and nanotechnology, the projection finds a new home inthese very different, but equally exciting tools and methods.Physics> > > > > We now know that every particle has an antiparticle, with which it can> > > > > annihilate.

The questions posed bymodern physics, especially since the advent of quantum theory, simply beg foresoteric interpretation. Admittedly, this has been tiresomely overdone in NewAge publishing circles in recent decades. Nevertheless, some of the more subtlemystery projections may have been overlooked, as they lie beneath the surface ofthe overt questions being investigated.The quote from Hawking above may serve as a suitable starting place for ourdiscussion. In his theory, we can see physicists striving to comprehend the verynature of matter and existence. It implies a (+1) and a (-1) inherent in allthings, as well as the energy released by their rapturous union. This is no lessthan a scientific re-statement of the 0=2 formula, yet it also reveals a mysteryprojection concerning the nature of truth and reality: Everything that is,implies its opposite. We are immediately reminded of Crowley’s commentsregarding the nature of Truth and Falsehood, and the energy which becomesavailable to us as we slam these philosophical poles together, burning them upin the crucible of our minds.Unification Theory and the ‘Big Bang’The quest for the so-called “unification theory” in physics reveals a similarlycosmic mystery projection. Such a unification theory, when devised, will explainall universal phenomenon, from the subatomic level all the way to the behaviorof huge bodies in space. This, quite explicitly, is a science-based search forthe same basic truths of life which all mystery schools and religions havesought. As Qabalists, we ponder a theory of creation which explains the originsof the world from ancient, infinite nothingness right down to the details of themanifest physical realities that surround us. The Tree of Life is our Qabalisticunification theory. Society at large, however, largely lacking a language whichsimultaneously describes cosmic creation and its linkage to the transformationof consciousness, projects this onto the concept of a unification theory basedon physics, which concerns itself with the material universe alone.The theories of Newtonian physics, relativity and quantum mechanics all breakdown when investigating the first moment of the universe’s existence. Sciencehas been able to explain these processes back to a certain point in time, but asthey approach the actual moment of origin, all theories fail. The mysteries ofthe so-called “big bang” form a perfect field for projections, in that theytease us with unanswered questions about our ultimate origins. Here we find amystery projection reminiscent of the Qabalistic ain: genesis out ofnothingness, and an absolute which is insensible and unknowable. The Qabalahconceives of this trans-supernal point of origin as being beyond rationality–atruth beyond reason. It seems entirely possible that any eventual unificationtheory will require its conceiver to attain a state of consciousness whichencompasses both conventional intellectual conceptions as well as asupernal-like transrationality. Indeed, such speculations seem to point us inthe direction of our further evolution as a species. Perhaps the greatscientists of humanity’s future will need to be great mystics as well. Thisoverlap of science and mysticism is hardly unprecedented in our past, but itsobjects of study and its frontiers will have to continually evolve, as will thehuman mind itself.Consider also how popular descriptions of “God” vary with the terminology andscientific conceptions available in the contemporary science of any era ofhumanity’s evolution. During the last Aeon, God was mostly seen as a paternal,lever-pulling deity ruling a mechanistic universe. This matched the Newtonianview of the functioning of all forces and objects in the known world. The lastcentury, in contrast, has seen God increasingly described as “energy,” “light,”and an immanent, connecting “force,” even in non-mystical popular culture. Theseconceptions, of course, mirror the current state of scientific inquiry into theorigins and functioning of the universe.Absolute SpacePhysicist Lee Smolin, commenting on Newton’s theories, remarks, “For Newton, theuniverse lived in an infinite and featureless space. There was no boundary, andno possibility of conceiving anything outside of it. This was no problem forGod, as he was everywhere. For Newton, space was the ‘sensorium’ of God–themedium of his presence in and attachment to the world. The infinity of space wasthen a necessary reflection of the infinite capacity of God.”41[index_split_045.html#filepos662578] If any scientific frontier begs for amystery projection, it is this one. The study of the mysteries of space throwsthe mind into an exalted state. To contemplate with awe the enormity, the power,the expanse, the complexity of our universe, is virtually a jnana yoga practice(compare this with Crowley’s Liber Batrachophrenobookosmomachia, assigned to thePracticus of A∴A∴, which endeavors to accomplish this very task through detailedvisualization of the physical cosmos).The Nature of LightOne of the most heated debates in the field of quantum physics has concerned thenature of light. Specifically, physicists have sought to determine whether lightis a wave or a particle. Compellingly, they have concluded that it sometimesbehaves as a wave, and sometimes as a particle, depending on the specificcircumstances of investigation. The mystery projection here concerns the natureof human consciousness as an individual or collective phenomenon; that is, wesometimes behave as if we have individual existence and independent will. Atother times, we seem to be just a droplet in a wave of mass mind. As physiciststurn their observing eyes to ever more microscopic subjects, their alchemycontemplates the nature of mind itself.Black HolesThe phenomenon of so-called “black holes” is a wonderful screen for mysteryprojections. Consider their apparent nature: infinitely small and dense, and sopotent in their gravitational pull that not even light can escape them. Themystery projection: our mind tries to grapple with the concept of the power ofnothingness. Infinite smallness.The dimensionless point of Kether, and itsinfinite power.Dark MatterAuthor Charles Seife notes: “Cosmologists now conclude that the gravitationalforces exerted by…dark matter, made of an as-yet undiscovered type of particle,must be sculpting…vast cosmic structures. They estimate that this ‘exotic darkmatter’ makes up about 25% of the stuff in the universe—five times as much asordinary matter.”42 [index_split_045.html#filepos662769] Furthermore, scientiststell us that so-called “dark energy,” an antigravity force, makes up theremaining 70% of all the substance of the universe. The implications of this arestriking, even on a purely physical level. Ordinary matter as we know itcomprises only 5% of the known universe. The mystery projection is profound aswell: there is much more to the world, and to the very nature of who we are,than we have ever perceived or imagined. Unseen and insensible forces areeverywhere, and there is much more we have yet to discover about reality.Uncertainty PrinciplesVarious principles involving uncertainty and probability in physical phenomena,prominent in quantum physics, have become fairly well known to the lay public inrecent years. Essentially, these principles assert that we cannot measuresomething at the subatomic level without affecting its properties, and that itis impossible to precisely measure a subatomic particle’s momentum and itslocation simultaneously. The mystery projection: mind inevitably affects theuniverse. Our own consciousness is always a filter through which we perceive theworld. Interestingly, however, new research suggests that it may be possible tomeasure something without affecting it if the measurement technique isrelatively “weak,” or unobtrusive. Paul Davies, a physicist at Arizona StateUniversity, comments that “weak measurements let you lift the veil of secrecyimposed by the uncertainty principle.”43 [index_split_045.html#filepos662970]One potential implication of this, and another key mystery projection here, iswell-known to mystics: our perceptions of the universe are more accurate when westill the mind, and impose less of our individual consciousness on thephenomenon observed.Multiple RealitiesThe superstring theory of physics, as described by Brian Greene and others,posits a universe filled with multiple dimensions (eleven, to be exact), andmyriad realities comprised of alternate paths for our lives. Again, theimplications are staggering even on the physical plane, but in this theory wesee a profound mystery projection: The mind itself exists in multiple realitiesconstantly. We are simultaneously in the past, present and future, rememberingpast achievements or regrets, dreaming of future goals, wondering about thevarious outcomes our everyday choices may bring. Human consciousness isundoubtedly non-linear, and thought and memory predictably discontinuous,leaving us with the very real sense of living in multiple realities within andwithout.Space Exploration and the Possibility of Intelligent Extraterrestrial LifeIn his final book, The Inner Reaches of Outer Space, Joseph Campbell assertsthat our modern focus on space, and space exploration, is no less than the innersearch for Selfhood and knowledge, projected outward onto the physical universe.Furthermore, it seems that we project the basic “solitude” of our individual egoonto the potential that intelligent life will be found elsewhere in theuniverse. That is, the outer reality—“us” looking for “them”—is a projection ofour inner existential state – as the “I” strives to know that which is outsideitself. The mystery of the nature of individual, self-conscious existence isprojected onto the concept of “other worlds.” Furthermore, you will recallJung’s opinion, referenced above, that we will never fully understand the natureof the human mind until we have made contact with an intelligent, non-humanmind.Computer ScienceComputer science, with its emphasis on creating intelligent, complex,self-regulating thinking machines, offers us a receptive screen for mysteryprojections. The mere existence of computer science requires us to postulatemodels of “consciousness” as they might be applied to the world of silicon. Indoing so, we find ourselves in much the same role as the Qabalistic neshamah(superconsciousness), building little ego-like (ruach) structures with ourdivine creative power. This identification with the source of creative power isnot unlike the mystery projection previously discussed in reference to DNA.Furthermore, it reveals what I believe is one of the central shifts inconsciousness from the time of the ancient alchemists to our own era. Theancient alchemists were on the cusp of the discovery of the full power of theruach, prefiguring the vibrant fruition of the arts and sciences in thecenturies to follow. We, however, are poised for the next step—to bring theruach into conscious relationship with the neshamah as a baseline state for themajority of humanity, and come into our birthright as Gods upon earth. We arefinally becoming aware that we need not limit ourselves to the role of aservant, subjugated to the will of an overseeing “God” in the sky. While theancient alchemists couched their quest in the language of ruach-identifiedworshippers, we modern alchemists can see ourselves as divine beings, capable ofincredible feats of self-directed creation, and our alchemical language hasprogressed accordingly. Presuming that we have the fortitude to undertake therequisite inner development, we can now identify with the neshamah. We are themasters of our own wills, directing the ruach from that secret throne—thedivinity of inmost Self.ConclusionJust as ancient alchemy was systematized within the chemical sciences from whichit drew its inspiration, so is 21st century alchemy systematized, to a greateror lesser extent, in each of the scientific disciplines discussed here.Certainly, one central task of any modern aspiring alchemist must be tointerlace the truths available to us in these disparate fields, and weave themtogether into a potent, internally consistent “mystery system.” Of course, assoon as such a system is in place, new discoveries and new questions will expandscientific frontiers once more, and our alchemy will again be transformed.As modern alchemists and magicians, we have the great advantage of severalcenturies of further development of our mystery schools, plus the relatively newfield of psychological science, to aid us in our understanding of these innerchange processes. We’ve learned a great deal about ourselves since Paracelsuslast fired up his athanor. But we have a new problem. While medieval alchemistsfound their vocabulary in the (then) cutting edge processes of controlledchemical combination, distillation, and so on, and benefited from theirinevitable naiveté with these new sciences, we in the modern era have integratedthese sciences into our conscious understanding of how the world works. Theyhave lost their mystery, and their former frontiers are now well-trod terrain.They seem self-evident, especially to those of us who devote our lives to thepath of self-transformation. Even society at large has substantially integratedboth the physical sciences comprising ancient alchemy, and their psychologicalcounterparts, as simple facts of life. We need a new language—the language ofmodern science, empowered by the freedom and energy of the New Æon.Yet, the language of alchemy, broadly understood, is itself a veil—an attempt byits practitioners, consciously or not, to reveal something of the nature of themystery. This veil is woven by our attempts to communicate about themystery—attempts which may, on the surface, seem unsuccessful. Yet, any apparentfailure in this endeavor is in fact a success if it inspires us to the quest,and impels us to lift the veil, that we might catch a glimpse of that truthwhich lies eternally behind it.Works CitedCampbell, J.

Let us now turn our attention to a more practical matter: Howmight the magician use the concepts of alchemy to understand and enrich his orher personal work? The field of alchemy is so rich with symbolic content, entirebooks could be (and have been) written on its practical application. We willneed to narrow our exploration to three specific symbolic ‘templates’ to addressour present purposes:> > 1. The solve et coagula formula> > 2. The transformative processes known as the Black Work, the White Work> > and the Red Work> > 3. The doctrine, ‘to make Gold thou must have Gold’For the most part, we will discuss these templates in terms of the path towardthe Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel which, as I haveemphasized many times in this book, is the one goal toward which all aspirantsmust strive from the beginning of their work in A∴A∴.The processes under discussion here are exceedingly subtle, encompassinggradual, long-term changes in your thoughts, emotions, behaviors, and innersymbolic life. You will definitely be at an advantage if your daily magicaldiary is thorough and detailed. While you can plan ahead and chart a coursebased on these frameworks, to some degree, one of the most effective ways todetect these patterns is retrospectively, as you reflect on the practices andresults noted in the diary. The more you have integrated the self-analysis andthe monitoring of your physical body, your psyche, your emotions and so on, themore data will be available for you to understand your progress when viewedthrough the lens of these alchemical frameworks. For each of these templates, Iwill first discuss its basic nature, and then I will give a few practicalsuggestions on how to monitor or implement it in your daily life and youroverall magical path.Solve et CoagulaSolve et coagula roughly translates as “dissolve and coagulate.” It refers tothe process of breaking something apart into its individual elements, in orderto understand and transform them before reassembling them into a newly perfectedwhole. One of the clearest examples of this in A∴A∴ is the progression throughthe elemental grades from Neophyte to Adeptus Minor. Essentially, you arelooking at yourself in terms of the individual components of which you arecomposed, based on the symbolism of the elements and the sephiroth (see Chapters15 and 16). Viewed from the perspective of the highest levels of attainment,human beings are not a collection of parts, but an undivided whole; yet in theFirst Order work of A∴A∴ you act as if you are composed of such parts for thesake of thorough self-analysis. At each step, you focus on one particularelement, and attempt to come into a deeper relationship with that part ofyourself. You must first purify it—that is, to cleanse it of any accretions thatare not in accord with its basic nature. For example, the Neophyte of Malkuthmust purify the physical body, casting aside any habits that might impedeprogress in the Great Work. Once the element has been cleansed, it must beconsecrated; that is, it must be put mindfully in service to the spiritual path.Eventually, after you pass through the four elemental grades and arrive atDominus Liminis, these ‘components’ are reassembled into a perfect microcosm andoffered to the HGA. You have reconstructed your very being in keeping with thepattern of the Tree of Life, and therefore with the structure of the universeitself. As I have stated elsewhere, the proper force is only drawn to the properform, and in this case the mere existence of the proper form—yourself as aperfected microcosm—is a powerful invocation of the HGA. Ideally, your entirelife becomes a continuous, living invocation perfectly suited to the indwellingof the Angel. Be the lightning rod, and the lightning will strike! Thequintessential method of pursuing this result is, of course, the formal work ofA∴A∴, but you will find the conscientious use of the daily elemental monitoringdiscussed Chapter 4 is a useful preliminary discipline.The Black Work, the White Work and the Red WorkAs above, we will map this out across the sephiroth and paths below Tiphereth.The Black Work relates primarily to Malkuth and the path of tav. Here you mustdifferentiate the fine from the gross—to discover the reality of spirit and selfthat is veiled by matter. You explore the relationship between the body and thepsyche, and strengthen your vision into the astral worlds by increasing yoursensitivity to its subtle impressions. In practice, you accomplish this viamonitoring diet, exercise, and physical health overall. Yoga practices furtherstrengthen your physical vehicle, and astral explorations such as those in LiberO, bring mastery of the body of light (see Chapter 11).Once you have seen past the veil of matter and begun to peer into the realms ofspirit by strengthening your astral vision, you are ready to move into the WhiteWork, attributed to the sephiroth Yesod, Hod, and Netzach. Broadly speaking,this is a stage of intense psychological self-exploration. Here, you survey theworld of Yetzirah in its various forms—the emotional, intellectual, andintuitive faculties resident in the human personality—and reformulate them tooperate with maximum efficiency and cooperation.How does this look in practice? In Yesod, you accomplish more advanced astralwork, undertake kundalini-stirring pranayama practices, and work intensely tounearth the drives, hidden agendas, and energy-blocking obstacles of yourunconscious mind. Monitoring psychological projections to understand how you seethe world through the lens of your own mind is an essential step, and formalpsychotherapy is often a useful adjunct. In Hod, you bolster your intellectualacumen through the study of the Qabalah—this is essentially jnana yoga, the yogaof knowledge. A sharp mind, honed through the development of critical thinkingskills, skepticism, and the mental calisthenics of the Qabalah, is a vitalelement to put in service of your Great Work. Finally, in Netzach, youstrengthen your understanding and ability to control the forces of your desireand aspiration through bhakti yoga and related devotional practices.Having thus completed the White Work, you stand at the threshold of the RedWork—the Veil of Paroketh (Dominus Liminis) and the eventual attainment ofTiphereth itself (Adeptus Minor). Here, the task is the confection of thealchemical stone—the solar gold at the center of the fully realized Self. It issimilar in many ways to the coagula phase described above—the task is to bringall of your prior work to a climax. Having arrived at a place of balance andintegration, you aspire to the HGA and await its light. At this stage you arevery much ‘stewing in your own juices,’ spiritually and psychologically. Therest is not about external effort so much as awaiting the transformative work ofthe HGA itself. Much of whatever else needs to happen at this stage will bebeyond the conscious efforts of the aspirant.This particular stage is, quite frankly, one of the most mysterious and wondrousthings to behold in all of the Great Work. It never ceases to amaze me how everyaspirant seems to get exactly what they need, exactly when they need it—not toomuch or too little, and not a moment too soon or too late. There is somethinguniquely powerful about building yourself up to this stage, and then offeringyourself up to the HGA freely and without egoic clinging for furthertransformation. The HGA inevitably responds with the force necessary to forgeyou, via this climatic Red Work, into an adept. Having attained this Knowledgeand Conversation and its accompanying awareness of True Will, you are thenprepared to go forth and enact the will in your life.“…to make Gold thou must have Gold…”Consider Crowley’s words in Liber Aleph, Cap. 159, “On the Balance in which theFour Virtues have Equal Power”:> > > By Gñana Yoga cometh thy Man to Knowledge; by Karma Yoga thy Bull to Will;> > > by Raja Yoga is thy Lion brought to his Light; and to make perfect thy> > > Dragon, thou hast Bhakti Yoga for the Eagle therein, and Hatha Yoga for> > > the Serpent.

As Crowley describes, thisrelates to the adoption of transformative goals that are in line with our truenature, but it also applies to the larger body of aspirants to the Great Workand their interactions. You can probably call to mind a few examples ofoutstanding people you have met in your life—people who seem to shine in theirselfhood—who live willfully and powerfully, yet also exhibit grace and dignityin all they do. These are a few of the characteristics we can recognize as signsof a true adept, whatever their particular spiritual path may be. Their veryenergy is contagious in a most wonderful way, and being around them is aninspiring lesson in living a vigorous life of will. The ‘gold’ of theirattainment is recognized by some corresponding seed of gold within us, and itbegins to resonate in sympathy, calling us in our own unique way to the path ofattainment.As a practical application of this principle, I suggest you seek out severalpeople that inspire you in this way. Ask them about their path: How did they getwhere they are? What called to them or inspired them? What do they considertheir best choices and their worst failures? Naturally, their path won’t be yourpath, but you might be surprised to discover how many of the tools they usedwill be valuable to you along your way. Much as in the system of A∴A∴ itself, wecan never know the particular twists and turns that any aspirant’s path willtake, but it is possible to set up signposts for those who follow. As we read inLiber Causæ:> > > Every man must overcome his own obstacles, expose his own illusions.

This is not surprising, as these pitfalls aremore-or-less inevitable along the path of attainment. There is just no questionthat, no matter who you are or what course of training you undertake, you willcome up against such obstacles. And inevitably, you’ll encounter patterns andcycles in your magical work, including dry spells, ecstatic peaks where you feelconnected and vibrantly aligned with the work, and everything in between.One of the real keys to persistence, and sustained motivation and connectionwith the work, is having some understanding that these cycles are inevitable—notbeating yourself up when they occur, and not letting yourself slip intodespondency when things aren’t going like you planned or expected. In thischapter we’ll examine a few different angles on this, including ways tounderstand and conceptualize the cycles, and how to break yourself out of dryspells when they occur.The IAO FormulaLet’s start with a discussion of how to understand these cycles—that is, how togive them a conceptual framework so that you can make sense of them and even usethem to your advantage. Crowley touches on some of these topics in Magick inTheory and Practice when he discusses the various magical ‘formulas’. Oneimportant example is called the IAO formula.The IAO formula, understood in this present context, is a three-stage cycleapplicable to any endeavor, whether magical work or something else entirely. Thethree stages correspond to the deities of Isis, Apophis, and Osiris. The Isisstage (‘I’) is characterized by an innocence—a freshness of experience—that youbring to the undertaking. For example, say you’ve taken on a new ritualprocedure, and you’re beginning to experiment with it. You’re excited about it,and you’re experiencing it as a stimulating new direction in your life. Youapproach it with a good deal of passion and commitment.Eventually, you move into what we call the Apophis phase (‘A’) where you getdisillusioned, you start to feel a little bit lazy, and you start to getdisappointed that perhaps it’s not going as well as you expected. You begin toquestion whether it was the right choice. You get tired of doing the same thingover and over again. Let’s say you’ve decided, “Okay, I’m really going to workon asana now. I’m going to sit in that posture and lengthen my time.” And thenabout the second week of doing this every day the boredom sets in, you startgetting distracted, and you begin to yearn for something different. You get theidea.And then you reach the Osiris stage (‘O’) in which (much like the archetype ofOsiris as the arisen god who has been reformed anew) you get new insights andperspectives on the blockages you’ve just come through. You emerge from thatmiserable blackness—the ‘A’ phase—with a newfound clarity about the wholeprocess.What is essential here is to understand that you can’t get to a matureunderstanding of any process without going through that middle phase. The GreatWork is not all about innocence and perfection, newness and excitement, leadingdirectly to enlightenment. It requires you to move through the frustrating, evenpainful disillusionment and questioning that occurs in the middle phase in orderto really grasp what it’s all about and integrate it.I encourage you to keep the IAO formula in mind when you’re undertaking a newtask—a new course of training, for example. Let it help you avoid getting boggeddown, disillusioned, and above all else, let it help you persist through the ‘A’phase—through that Apophis darkness—and emerge on the other side so that you canattain to true mastery of the task at hand.Solve et CoagulaAnother useful conceptual model applicable to these magical cycles is our oldfriend, solve et coagula. You will recall that this consists of the solve phase,in which things are intentionally broken apart, analyzed, and fragmented,followed by the coagula phase, where things are brought together, re-integrated,and synthesized in a more refined form. Through this process, one attains adeeper understanding of the basic nature of each of the components analyzed, andthe interconnectedness between them. The whole becomes truly more than the sumof its parts.When you’re in the middle of one of these stages – when your focus is so drawnto just one aspect of yourself—there will be a tendency toward dryness. Oralternately, you will be so immersed in that one point of view that it’s hard tosee outside your current conceptual framework. Either way, the danger is one oflosing sight of the overall pattern. For example, the Neophyte may forget thatall her work on asana is simply addressing the basic task of getting her body tobe still – and is only one stage in the ongoing solve process; or the Practicus(immersed in the intellectual sphere of Hod) may become preoccupied with booklearning, and neglect to keep the fires of aspiration burning.More distressingly, the solve end of the equation (the analysis and thefragmentation phase of the work) can be very disillusioning. It can lead us tofeel that there are just too many aspects drawing our attention—a multiplicityof individual life-threads that we can’t weave into a coherent whole, orusefully comprehend. It can be quite overwhelming.What’s the remedy to all this frustration? When you feel this way, remember thatyou’re simply on one end of the cycle. You’re in a phase of the path where it’ssupposed to feel that way, until you get to the next phase—the coagula phase ofsynthesis. So try not to lose heart at those moments. To be slightly clichéabout this, things have to fall apart before they can fall back together; andwhen they fall back together, it will be in a refined and perfected pattern, byvirtue of the falling apart and the self-knowledge it has engendered.The Upward SpiralHere’s another general principle you may find useful. When you get to a stuckplace, a dry spell, or an obstacle that feels like an blockage in your work, oneof the greatest gifts you can give yourself is to see it as an upward spiralrather than a return ‘to square one.’ In other words, you’ve come back around toa place that you recognize—one that feels dry and unsatisfying and stagnant. Butif you can see how this time around is slightly different than the last time; ifyou can find a way to understand, within the context of your overall progress,that this particular stuck place is the latest example of a category of stuckplace, but it’s not the same stuck place you encountered before—this can helpyou stay motivated and avoid the disillusionment that comes with feeling you’regoing nowhere.Post-Attainment DepressionLet’s look at some other ways to understand and experience stuck points andobstacles that we encounter in the Great Work. One of the most important is theexperience of coming to a new understanding—a moment when you feel like you’vefinally gotten your head above the clouds. You’ve had a profound mysticalexperience of some kind, or a breakthrough in a line of work you’re pursuing.And inevitably (because you’re a human being) you come back down from thatexalted state into the mundane world. You must now go to work, deal with yourfamily, and otherwise resume outer life. Sure enough, the mundane world hasn’tparted like the Red Sea in front of you to be a problem-free environment. Youget disillusioned. You have glimpsed a higher truth, and it’s depressing not tobe able to remain in that vision.Once again, the key is to have some compassion with yourself and understand thatthe ego, the ruach, is trying to adjust to straddling that gap between theidealized experience and the way that most of life plays out in a mundanefashion. The key to avoiding despair here is to understand the universality ofthis experience among spiritual seekers. It’s completely expectable andcompletely normal. And it is not a bad sign of anything. You’ve had your headabove the clouds and you’ll get back there when the time is right.Finding LessonsAnother way to look at obstacles, stuck places, and dry spells is to ask whatthe obstacle is teaching you. Why did you need to be stuck right now? Why didyou need to be held down in the same place longer than your ego wanted? Often,it will be due to a particular maturation process that you needed to undergo.You needed to slow down, look at something, feel something, or wrestle withsomething. And I think if you reflect back on the times in your life that havebeen most transformative you will find that those growth periods were very oftenaccompanied by intense discomfort and challenge. The process of moving towardKnowledge and Conversation of the HGA has many points where it is necessary tobe slowed down, to be hindered while we grow in just the way we need to grow,and experience exactly the trials that we need to in order to become a moreperfect vessel for the light that is awaiting us.Another question to ask yourself when you encounter an obstacle or stuck pointis: Do I have an undue degree of lust of result here? How much ego-attachment doI have to whatever goal I’m working toward? And is that tripping me up? All ofus find ourselves in this position from time to time, and we must strive to beconscious of such impediments to success.When Spirit EntersIt is useful to consider the mechanism by which these dark times intrude intoour work and our lives. Jungian analyst Robert Johnson has lectured extensivelyon this process. He discusses the various portals through which Spirit (histerm) enters our lives. One of these is through encounters with paradoxicalsituations. When we encounter a choice point in life—a dilemma that seems tohave no rational solution—we’re stuck between the proverbial rock and a hardplace. We don’t know what to do, and no choice seems right.In these situations, the ego is stymied by the situation, and has nowhere toturn. It can’t think itself though the problem. And in this ego-breakdown, spaceis created for superconsciousness to enter. There is an opening for inspirationand intuition. If you trust this process – if you let go of the habitualattachment to thinking your way out of these dilemmas – you will make room foryour own spiritually informed conscience to guide you.Another way that spirit enters our lives, according to Johnson, is throughshadow confrontations. When we are tripped up by something unacknowledged orunwanted in ourselves, we are facing our shadow. For example, we may have atendency toward excessive emotional attachment to people or things, anaddiction, a conflict between our magical goals and the external life we haveset up for ourselves, and so on. These are things that we’ll likely want to pushaway and not think about, yet in facing them we open up some of the truestopportunities we’ll ever have for growth and transformation.If we embrace the shadow we can allow the voice of spirit to be heard. Thisvoice deep within us is urging us not to ignore the totality of who we are; notto carve out a part of ourselves, demonize it, and refuse to look at it. Ifwe’ve been doing that, it’s going to come find us. And the sooner we embrace thedisowned aspect of self rather than run from it, the sooner we will begin togrow.Practical SuggestionsHere are a few final, practical suggestions for getting unstuck. One of them isas much a cognitive-behavioral therapy principle as it is a magical principle:Just do anything. When you feel stuck, lost, or overwhelmed, simply take actionso that you can see you’re not actually immobilized. There’s no way you’re goingto be able to tell yourself, “I’m stuck, I can’t do anything” when you’ve justgotten up to do a banishing, a few minutes of meditation or some other task.Write in your diary. Take a walk. Pick a random book off the shelf and read itfor a few minutes. Don’t worry about which thing you choose. Just do something.One of the big traps that people get into is overthinking, or gettingperfectionistic with their magical choices. They feel that if they don’t pickjust the right thing to do, it must be the wrong thing to do. They fear thatchoosing the ‘wrong’ ritual or practice will drastically impede their progressalong the path. In almost every case, however, these choices are not socritical, so don’t make it harder on yourself by thinking in this manner. Weusually learn more from our magical mistakes than our easy successes, in anycase.Another way to get unstuck is to perform a divination. Consider your situation,and make a conscious decision not to rely purely on the ego to find a solution.Do a Tarot spread, throw the I Ching or even simply flip a coin. It’s a good wayto loosen the ego’s grip and shake up your thought process.ConclusionNo matter which methods you choose to help yourself get through the challengesof the magical path, you will inevitably gain insight into your most commonproblem patterns. Your hard-earned experience with embarrassing screw-ups,frustrating stuck places, and depressing ‘dark nights of the soul’ will be thevery fuel for your future attainments. And each time you make another passaround that upward spiral, you will be more empowered to find effectivesolutions to the challenges you find there."},{"pageContent":"25 DREAMWORKAs a Jungian psychologist, dreamwork has been an important part of my personalwork and my professional practice for many years. It was one of the things thatmost intrigued me about Jung’s approach from the very beginning of my career.Much like psychotherapy, dreamwork can be an important tool for the personaldevelopment of the magician, enhancing self-knowledge and the magical power thatcomes with it. I highly recommend dreamwork as a daily practice for the magicianat every stage of the path.Carl Jung called dreams “the royal road to the unconscious.” His theoryemphasizes the importance of balancing the conscious and unconscious minds, andit posits that dreams are sent from the Self as messages intended to bringbalance and wholeness. Dreams are designed to be heard by the Ego, the consciousmind, and the intention is always to promote wholeness and growth. Dreamsattempt to communicate information the ego needs to know in order to be moreself-aware, and to balance out the predispositions in the conscious mind—tointegrate shadow material and other unacknowledged or repressed aspects of thepsyche. We can readily see much overlap here with the other symbolic processesused by the magician, such as scrying, pathworking on the Tree of Life, workingwith symbolic elements in ritual and similar techniques. Dreams are ready-madecontainers for these same symbol sets. The more rich and diverse we make oursymbolic repertoire through memorization of magical correspondences,mythological exploration, and understanding of comparative religious systems,the more meaning we will be able to extract from our dreams.Nevertheless, we must be appropriately skeptical about the nature of dreams. Asnoted above, Jungians tend to argue that dreams are a definite attempt on thepart of the unconscious to deliver specific messages. In contrast, manycontemporary cognitive scientists believe that dreams are simply random firingsof neurons, devoid of any particular meaning. Regardless, even if dreams arerandom neuronal fireworks—even if the very existence of some kind of purposefulsubconscious dream-wisdom is a fallacy—I find dreamwork to be an extremelyvaluable tool to get ‘outside the box’ of everyday rational thought, by dealingwith these more or less irrational symbol sets. Dreamwork forces us to explorecertain aspects of ourselves, via these symbolic contents, that we might nothave hit on if we were just living in the rational world of our everyday minds.At the very least, much like with divination or scrying, we will get uniqueviews of ourselves, and some invigorating mental calisthenics out of thebargain.When working with dreams, it is very important to use your own symbol sets.Avoid at all costs those dream symbol cookbooks offering predigestedinterpretations of common symbols. There is a time and a place for moving beyondyour own personal interpretations into more mythological and archetypal themes,but for the most part you should rely on your own associations. Another veryimportant consideration is that in the Jungian approach, everything in the dreamis some aspect of you. If you dream of having a conversation with your mother,it’s not a dream about your relationship with your actual mother. Rather, itpertains to the interaction between your ego and that part of you that is bestsymbolized by your mother. A house may refer to a ‘location’ or state of beingwithin you; a storm may symbolize a tempestuous process within you, and so on.Don’t give in to the temptation of overly concretizing and externalizing thecharacters, places and processes in a dream.In his seminal book Inner Work46 [index_split_045.html#filepos663543], Jungiananalyst Robert Johnson describes the basic Jungian approach to dream analysis ina concise, four-step process.Step One: Write down everything you can recall about the dream contentitself—the story, the location, the characters, the emotions you felt, and soon. The next step is to make associations to each specific element of the dreamcontent. Let’s say you dreamed about a house that you lived in when you were 14years old, and in the dream you were having a conversation with a childhoodfriend. In step one, you will just associate to that house. What age were youwhen you lived there? What was your life like then? What was your emotionalstate? What are the good and bad things you remember from living in that house?Make associations to the childhood friend as well. What were the personalitycharacteristics of the friend? How would you describe the friend to someone thatdidn’t know him/her?Be careful not to get into ‘chain associations’ where thinking about the friendreminds you about a bike you had and the bike reminds you about the car that yougot later, and so on. Rather, you should keep tying your associations back tothe basic symbol as it actually appeared in the dream. For the major symbols inthe dream, it may help to do this graphically. Write the word, draw a circlearound it, and then draw lines to point to the different associations related tothe symbol, so you end up with a ‘map’ of symbolic associations.Step Two: Connect the dream images to your own inner dynamics, and ‘amplify’ theimages and symbols via traditional sources. Occasionally, dream contents maystrike you as being what Jung called numinous; that is, they have a certainquality that seems to resonate beyond the specific content you personallyassociate to the various symbols. For example, I remember once having a dream inwhich I was living in some sort of culture that lived on the slopes of an activevolcano. Obviously, this is not something from my personal life! Jungians mightrefer to this as a ‘big dream’—a dream that practically screams, “There is moreto this than your little individual existence!” In amplifying this dream, Ifound it useful to look at myths involving volcanoes and similar themes. Most ofthe time, however, you will be connecting your dream images to inner dynamics inmore direct ways drawn from your normal waking life and identity. So, in ourexample about the childhood friend, you would have perhaps identified that thisfriend was caring, a good listener and loyal in Step One. Maybe the housebrought back pleasant and loving memories of your family during the time youlived there. Here in Step Two, when you are connecting dream images to innerdynamics, that friend is the caring and loyal part of you, and the house mightrepresent the state of mind in which you nurture yourself and when you slow downand enjoy your time with people and so on.Step Three: Weave these inner dynamics together to create an interpretation ofthe entire dream. The goal is to tell a story based on what you’ve determined tobe the inner aspects of yourself that are referred to in the dream. You arelooking for a ‘click,’ as Johnson would call it. When you ‘try on’ differentinterpretations, some of them may not resonate with you, but some will click.Turn on your bullshit detector. Did you learn something that you didn’t alreadyconsciously know? If you didn’t learn something new then chances are it’s notthe deepest message available in the dream. After all, in the Jungian theory ofthe psyche, if the ego already knows something, the unconscious doesn’t need totell it to us—there is no imbalance to correct. Are you at least slightlyuncomfortable with the interpretation? Does it sting a little bit? Do you feelenergized by the interpretation, as if it freed up some energy that was bound upin keeping certain things unconscious? All of these experiences may be hintsthat you have hit on a correct interpretation.In our example with the friend in the house, the dream might be suggesting thatyou need to set aside more time to check in with yourself about your emotionsand your general well being; that you need to create the inner equivalent ofthat positively remembered family home where you can more deeply listen toyourself. Essentially, you are being asked by the unconscious to act out thestory of the dream, which is to be your own caring, loyal friend and occupy yourown symbolic house of comfort and self-nurturance.Step Four: Perform a ritual to honor the dream and to make it concrete. Thetheory here is that the more concrete you make the message of the dream—the moreyou enact some sort of behavior that signals to your unconscious that you aretaking it seriously, and that you really understood the message of the dream—themore healing it can be. In our present dream example, you might pay a visit theold family home in the dream. Take some of the dirt from the front yard, put itin a vial or jar and perform a ritual with it. Set the jar on the mantle andkeep it with you as a reminder of the truth of the dream that you discovered.The possibilities are endless, and as with all ritual, the more you customize itto your own symbols and the specifics of your inner situation, the moreeffective it will be.Interestingly, and perhaps not surprisingly, this four-step process mirrors theQabalistic doctrine of the Four Worlds. In Step One, where you are makingspecific associations to the dream content, you are identifying the basic seedsfrom which everything else springs (Atziluth.) In Step Two, we are giving primalform to those seeds by fleshing them out with our associations and connectingthem to archetypal forms through amplification of the symbols. This is much likethe world of Briah, where the superconscious form is shaped. In Step Three, wetranslate these archetypes and higher dynamics into apprehensible and fullyconscious thought-forms—bringing the content down into the world of Yetzirah.Finally, in Step Four, we do the ritual of honoring the dream. It is easy to seehow this relates to the world of Assiah, where everything above is manifested inthe physical world—in this case, by our behavioral enactment of the message ofthe dream.A related technique you may find useful is active imagination, which Jungdescribed as “dreaming the dream onward.” In this technique, you enter into aquasi-meditative (but waking) state, and reengage with characters from the dreamin order to obtain more fodder for interpretation. You might set up a ritualspace, do a banishing, call forth a character from a recent vividdream—especially a dream that was confusing, or perhaps notably vivid orimportant—and then interact with the being from the dream. Ask it for moreinformation; ask it what its message is for you; ask it if there are otherthings you need to know about the content of the dream. One easy method ofrecording this is to sit at a computer and type your questions in lower case,then switch to all caps for the response of the character with whom you areinteracting. Once you have obtained a satisfactory amount of additionalinformation, plug it back into the context of the original dream and revisit thevarious steps of the interpretive process described above.Let me close with a few general suggestions:> > 1.

The primary focus here will be on romanticrelationships, but much of this material applies equally well to other types ofrelationships. That is, we strive to maintain maximum mutual respect for ourfriend or partner, including (and especially) respect for the other person’sinherent divinity—for the star that they are. We do our best not to interferewith their True Will as best we understand it, and to stand up for our ownautonomy when or if that is threatened. This is true of any relationship, butromantic relationships present other particular considerations I will reviewhere in some detail.As you might expect, much of what I say here is informed by my own clinicalpractice in psychology, and I do a significant amount of couples therapy. A fewyears ago, I encountered a wonderful book by Dr. David Schnarsch calledPassionate Marriage.47 [index_split_045.html#filepos663705] This book, more thanany other book on relationships I’ve ever seen, embodies a set of values thatapproximate the principles of Thelema. Much of what I’m going to say in thischapter is drawn from my own experience, but I will also present a number ofSchnarsch’s ideas. As with all of the information in this book, you should feelfree to experiment with these ideas, and disregard them if you find them not tobe in accord with your own will.Thelemic “Values” in RelationshipsSo, what exactly are the Thelemic values we can bring to bear on ourrelationships? The first principle that I would nominate is the concept ofindividual responsibility. In our society at large, it seems that a great dealof the focus is on the importance of making the other person happy. This iswhere we really get off track. We get obsessed with making the other personhappy, or with how the other person is doing at making us happy, and we measureour success as a partner by how well we are doing in this regard. I encourageyou to examine carefully your own assumptions and expectations in this area. Iam always telling my patients that when problems, conflicts, or obstacles arisein a relationship, we should not be asking, “why is the other person not doingthe thing that I want them to do? And what can the other person do to make mehappier?” Rather, we should be asking, “what am I doing to make myself happy?”If we are feeling lonely or un-nurtured in a relationship, our first line ofexploration should be “Have I nurtured myself ?” “Have I taken responsibilityfor my own level of satisfaction today?” If we’re feeling like our own needs arenot being met in the relationship, we should ask ourselves about our ownpriorities before we go to our partner and insist that they do a better job ofprioritizing what we need! As you may have detected, this is an area that isripe for projections—when our own limitations and weaknesses are projected ontoour partner. Essentially, we scapegoat them, treating them as the cause ofwhatever problem we may have, rather than acknowledging our own role in thematter.The second principle to consider is that the basic unit in a relationship,contrary to the conventional wisdom in our society, is the individual. Ideally,relationships exist for the growth and development of the individuals in them.It is through the growth and development of the individual that the health ofthe relationship is maintained. This flies in the face of the way mainstreamculture views relationships, and frankly, it overturns the way many contemporarycouples therapists view relationships as well! I should emphasize that the freewill and autonomy of each partner is of paramount importance. This doesn’t meanthat there are no compromises, or that shared goals don’t exist—and thiscertainly doesn’t mean the individuals in the relationship should not seek tofoster their partner’s health and happiness. It would be awfully drab anddepressing if relationships had none of this! But both partners tend to movetoward greater health quite naturally when they come into a relationship for thepurpose of working on themselves as individuals, and with the intention torespect each other’s efforts along the same lines. In this sense, a romanticrelationship is simply one of many opportunities we have in life to unite withothers to benefit ourselves, our partners, our community, our extended family,or any other unit of society.Another important principle to keep in mind is that relationship problems aregood for you. (Yes, really!) When you are physically wounded, the pain drawsyour attention to the place that needs healing. Similarly, in a relationship,when partners are in conflict, grating against each other’s comfort zones, thereis discomfort or pain. The partners are being challenged to stretch in some way,and where there is stretching, there is growth. The appropriate response is toallow ourselves to stretch—to relax into it rather than fight it. We mustrecognize that we have rigidity in some aspect of self and we’re reluctant tounclench the emotional muscles surrounding it. We should say, “this problem isshowing me some way I need to grow,” not, “this problem is due to somethingwrong with my partner that they need to change.” If your primary focus is yourown growth and learning, you are also supporting the growth and self-knowledgeof your partner. This is quintessentially Thelemic. Taking responsibility forourselves promotes health and healing for all concerned.Facing ChallengesLet’s turn our attention to some specific types of challenges that may occur inrelationships. One sort of challenge relates to magical practice itself: whenshould a couple work together on magical rituals, and when should they workseparately? Balance is the most important factor. For example, if you onlyperformed Liber Resh with a partner present you would lose some of theexperience of doing the ritual solo. Likewise, if you never experimented withdoing it with another individual, you might lose something of that experience.Any of you who have been in a room full of Thelemites doing Liber Resh togethercan attest that while you lose some of the specific intensity of your own solopractice, there’s something else entirely to be gained by approaching it as agroup ritual: the sense of fellowship with kindred spirits, the amplification ofintensity of worship due to all those wills being pointed at the singular goal,and so on. So, keep a balance between doing these rituals individually and doingthem with partners or friends.Another category of problem that can arise in a Thelemic relationship is whenthe partners are at different places in their personal magical path. Forexample, if they are both working in a particular order, but one holds a moreadvanced degree than the other, then they’re very likely to have differentpractices, different reference materials, perhaps different magical implementsand similar things that can’t be shared with the partner. This is an opportunityfor issues of secrecy and trust to emerge. If you feel yourself on theuntrusting end of this sort of situation, feeling upset that your partner is offdoing something they can’t tell you about, I think your first questions foryourself ought to be: “What is this challenging in me? What insecurity is thismaking me confront? What am I afraid of losing? What would it mean if my partnercouldn’t share everything with me?” If you do a thorough self-examination withquestions like these, you may come up with some important insights intoyourself; and by the time you’ve done that, you will likely find your worryabout this whole situation has dissipated somewhat. If you’re on the other sideof this equation (being unable to share something with your partner) you’ll wantto be as patient and compassionate as possible. Clarify that there are manythings you do share with them, but that this particular set of practices may notbe among those for the time being. And of course, you should both keep in mindthat the main point of having personal practices is for the growth and spiritualdevelopment of each individual, not to provide entertainment for the couple!An even more delicate situation is a relationship where one person is on theThelemic path and the other isn’t; or when one person is a practicing Thelemiteand the other person isn’t magically inclined. Perhaps they are even activelyopposed to magical practices. Assuming the couple decides to stay together, thecore issue is effective communication. The partner who is not involved must begiven a clear understanding of the basic aims of the magical path. It may takequite a bit of time to help the non-magician understand the fundamental reasonsfor doing these practices, so they can perceive that it is fundamentally a pathof self-development and spiritual growth.Of course, there are times when you may discover that your path really isdiverging from that of your partner. This can be a painful awakening. It doesn’ttake long being in the work before you encounter some broken relationship amongyour friends and fellow Thelemites. In the process of getting in tune with yourTrue Will, you may discover that the will has led you away from being able to beharmoniously partnered with a particular person. This is equally true in termsof occupations, alienation from family members, and so on. But before youconclude that you simply must leave this relationship, I hope that you will stopand ask yourself: How you are hindering your own progress? How might you beprojecting your own obstacles, your own procrastination, your ownselfnegativity, and your own lack of belief in what you are doing? Whatever youthink the other person is doing to block you or to hinder your progress—stop andask how you are doing that to yourself. Watch out for these projections, becausebelieve me if you don’t do this, and you preemptively end a relationship onthese grounds without this self-examination, there’s a fair chance you will endup regretting it.Relationship Advice from the ProphetTo conclude this chapter, I could do no better than to offer a few passages fromAleister Crowley’s essay called “Duty,” which is a wonderful examination of theimplications of the Law of Thelema as applied to our relationships with otherindividual humans, with society, and with the earth itself.48[index_split_045.html#filepos663874] Here are some selections that appearespecially relevant to our discussion in this chapter.> > > > > Your duty to other individual men and women.> > > > > To bring out saliently the differences between two points-of-view is> > > > > useful to both in measuring the position of each in the whole.

You can even use some of these tools when you find yourself in theposition of mediating a dispute between friends or brethren. Before readingfurther in this chapter, be sure to review Chapters 1 and 19, where I discussthe Qabalistic ‘parts of the soul’. An understanding of these doctrines will beessential if you wish to get a full grasp of the material in this chapter.The coping model we’ll present here, which is based on the Tree of Life, has oneparticularly interesting characteristic: the process we must undertake in orderto cope with any given challenge mirrors the path of evolution. That is, itinvolves movement up the Tree, symbolically speaking. All the action we willexamine here is toward Kether, and why would we expect otherwise? Any givenmoment in life can be a microcosm of the entire path of return if we approach itmindfully and with an intention to grow. In any particular instance ofdifficulty, we are given an opportunity to stretch toward a more evolvedviewpoint from which to attack the problem. Just as the Tree of Life representsthe microcosm of human consciousness, the macrocosm of universal creation, andthe path of evolution from base matter to full attainment; so is it also a mapof how to deal with any moment of life in a growth-oriented and constructiveway. The coping model we’ll discuss here is based on this ‘holographic’characteristic of evolution toward Kether.Let’s use the following situation as an example. You’ve had a very difficulttime at work. You’ve had conflicts with a coworker, and you’re feelingoverwhelmed. The first step of the coping model is to start at the bottom of thetree. Check the guph—the physical body in Malkuth. The health and well-being ofthe physical body is the basis of everything else you are experiencing, and ifthere is something wrong with the physical body, your perception and experiencewill be greatly influenced by this state. Are you ill, tired, hungry,underslept, or hung over? Look at all of these possibilities and understand thatif you don’t address these first, it will be difficult to move much beyond aphysically reactive level of functioning. As Abraham Maslow taught us with hismodel of the ‘hierarchy of needs,’ if the basic physical needs are not met, itis very difficult to put any constructive attention on more refinedpsychological needs, to say nothing of the even more rarefied spiritual needs.After you have checked in at the physical level, move further up the Tree towardKether, to Yesod. Here, we review potential stuck points or other problems inthe nephesh. Look for psychological projections, unconscious blockages, andemotional tides that are manifesting in the way you perceive the world at aprimal level. You may be going through your workday being battered about by thewinds of your unconscious and your emotions without even realizing that it’sspilling over into how you perceived your coworker’s words or actions. In termsof projections, ask yourself: Were they displaying a trait I really don’t likein myself, so I was particularly bothered by it? Were they doing something thatI try not to do, so I was ‘policing’ their behavior? And so on.Also in terms of subconscious issues, look for ‘secondary gain’ from patterns offailure. Is there some sort of psychological benefit to being stuck? Forexample, in our hypothetical situation, you may discover that you are keepingyourself in a victim role. Is there a benefit to your feeling of helplessness?Is it enabling you not to change or grow—to avoid facing some inner challengethat is uncomfortable? Is it easier to blame others than to take responsibilityyourself?Laxity in magical practice can also be disruptive at the nepheshic level. It isimportant to keep up with daily magical hygienic practices such as the pentagramritual, as well as energy-raising rituals such as Liber Resh and MiddlePillar-type exercises. Many initiates have found that sloppiness in the detailsof ritual and astral work can be similarly disruptive. Examples of this includecarelessly drawn pentagrams, or failure to be conscientious in pulling back allof the externalized astral substance into the physical body. If these issues arechronic, they may be experienced as a drain of energy, or a general feeling ofbeing ‘off’.The aim, as always, it to make the unconscious conscious—to raise our level ofawareness of nepheshic influence on our perception and emotional reactivity. Byundertaking this self-scrutiny, we evolve—in that very moment—to a level ofawareness that transcends the animalistic response patterns of the nephesh.Once you have examined the condition of the guph and the nephesh, it’s time tomove up the tree to the ruach. Here, we look for ego traps, blind spots, andhabitual modes of thinking that narrow our perception of the situation, and ourawareness of the range of emotional and behavioral responses to it. Returning toour hypothetical situation: perhaps you are driven by competitive urges, and theoffice conflict is stemming from some sort of rivalry with the coworker. Maybeyou are afraid of being embarrassed or humiliated, or you have a sense of fearof a social stigma related to the outcome of the situation. Anything thatinvolves the ego’s wants and needs can become a source of blockage here. Thisusually involves issues of personal comfort, superiority, stability ofcircumstances, self-esteem, social standing, and so on.Once you have identified the source of the problem, what do you do about it? Oneoption is to use thoughtfully crafted rituals to invoke those complementaryforces that balance the energies of which you have an excess, and vice-versa;don’t try to ‘banish away’ characteristics you feel you have in excess; instead,invoke the complementary force. For example, if you have too much aggression andanger, invoke Chesed rather than banishing Geburah. If you are feelingfuzzy-headed and confused in your view of a situation, do a Hod ritual to invokethe forces of mental clarity and stability. If you are feeling spiritually dryand unmotivated, as if your spiritual ‘batteries’ are not fully charged, invokeNetzach to fire up your aspiration and devotion to the Great Work. If you areoverthinking things and you want more intuitive guidance, invoke Yesod. If yousimply want to invoke spiritual force itself, or inspire yourself regarding yourmagical goals, or the aspiration to the HGA, invoke Tiphereth or Kether. Thereare an infinite variety of options, limited only by your creativity and thebreadth of your knowledge of correspondences and ritual forms.Aside from these ritual approaches to attacking the problem at the ego level,there are a few common-sense things to try as well. Review your magical diariesand see if there are clues about what may be tripping you up. What are therecent trends in your thoughts and emotions on a daily basis? Can you detectpatterns of emotional upset, interpersonal friction, and the like, that pointyou to a source of the problem? It may be useful to talk to one or more otherpeople to get some ruach-level input from outside your own head. Ask a friend.Also, ask someone who you know or suspect does not like you. As a mentalexercise, sit with their advice for a while, as if it is 100% true, and assembleyour own arguments in support of their input. Then let the pendulum ofskepticism swing the other way, and review the counter-arguments. None of thisadvice will be something that you have to slavishly follow if it doesn’t feelright to you, but it will be one good source of data.There is an important guiding principle underlying all of this. Once you haveidentified the level at which the conflict is occurring, your attempts todiscover the solution will involve intentional operation from one or another ofthe other levels above the level at which the conflict is occurring. Forexample, fairly obviously, if you are dealing with physical problems oremotional conflicts or complexes, you have to bump it up a level to involve yourego. The ego has to come in to remind you to sleep or eat, or to stop worryingso much about what that coworker thinks of you, and examine out yourprojections. You must kick it up to a higher level so that a more enlightenedpart of you can have a view of the situation. Likewise, if you have a conflictat the level of the ego, the solution will typically involve moving up to ahigher level of spiritual connection (neshamah/superconsciousness). In suchcircumstances, you must aspire to, and consciously identify with, the higherself to the extent that you can.Here are practical tips for this level of work. Perform an invocation of theHGA—or a prayer appealing to the HGA for clarity on the situation. Often, whenwe consciously feel stuck—like we are between a rock and a hard place, or aparadox that feels un-resolvable—it is because it is not the ego’s job to fixit. We need something more—something trans-rational and transpersonal—and atthose moments of ego conflict, blockage, and stuckness, re-establishing aconnection to the divine, superconscious wisdom within us is an essential step.In addition to coping with you own issues, you can use these tools to deal withconflicts with others as well. The same guiding principle applies here:determine the level of conflict and approach it from at least one level abovethat. Let’s say you have two friends having a conflict that is highly emotionalin nature. They are rolling around in the muck of anger, perhaps fueled byunconscious projections, and that is clearly at the nepheshic level. Your task,therefore, is to come into the situation as a problem solver at the ego level—tostand in for the frontal lobes they aren’t using much at the moment! You arehelping them to elevate themselves above the nepheshic level of functioning. Aneven more primal example is when people are actually physically fighting.Clearly it’s not usually constructive to rush in and physically fight withthem—that simply results in more people fighting! You must move to a higher,ego-based viewpoint to inject some sense into the situation.Suppose your friends are in conflict at the ego level, due to competitivestrivings that are manifesting in your local Thelemic community. Perhaps theydisagree strongly on how a problem should be solved, or each person doesn’t wantto admit any errors in judgment or behavior. Since this conflict is already atthe ego level, you must move up to a spiritual level. If you are all in the samemagical order, for example, you may want to appeal to their fraternal bonds.Remind them that they are magicians on the path, and that you can see from theoutside that they are stuck in an ego-based conflict. Perhaps they are bothright in their own ways, or perhaps there is another solution available thathonors the perspectives of both parties? Essentially, you bring a more nuancedand enlightened perspective to the situation by purposely and consciously takingit above the ego level of conflict.When fully conscious contact with the HGA is attained and stabilized at theAdeptus Minor grade of A∴A∴, many other resources become available. Your HGAwill teach you everything you truly need to know. In fact, all along the pathtoward K & C you will have developed many tools to do much of what I havedescribed in this chapter, in your own unique fashion. An important effect ofdeveloping these tools is that your progress toward attainment of the K & C willbe accelerated, because your energy will not be bound up in lower levels ofpsychological functioning. If energy is stuck there, it is unavailable to devoteto aspiration to higher purposes. Furthermore, even after the attainment of K &C, each successive stage of attainment beyond Tiphereth beings with it a broaderand more nuanced understanding of who you are, what you are here to do, and whatpowers and potencies are the most appropriate solutions for any difficulties youencounter.The Qabalah is much more than a source of arcane wisdom and magical techniques.If you conscientiously use the tools presented in this chapter, you will findthat the Qabalah is equally beneficial as a source of guidance in coping withthe challenges of everyday life outside your temple."},{"pageContent":"28 PSYCHOTHERAPYWhen I first conceived of writing this book, I knew I’d want to address theissue of psychotherapy and its relationship to the magical path. As you mightexpect, I have some bias in this regard. I have a strongly favorable opinionabout the utility of psychotherapy as we progress in magical work – but I’m notalone in this. We don’t have to look very deep into the writings of some of ouresteemed predecessors, such as Israel Regardie, Soror Meral and others, to seethat there’s quite a precedent for recommending psychotherapy as a prerequisiteor adjunct to the magical path.Aleister Crowley himself appears to have been fairly well-read in regard tocontemporary psychotherapeutic practices, but naturally, his perspective on thenature and utility of psychotherapy was necessarily limited by those forms oftherapy that were actually in existence during his lifetime—classical Freudianpsychoanalysis and its offshoots, such as the work of Carl Jung. One of the mostinteresting writings of Crowley’s on this topic is the essay called “AnImprovement on Psychoanalysis,” which was most recently published in The Revivalof Magick.49 [index_split_045.html#filepos664091] In this essay, Crowley opinesthat Jung’s theories come closer to the essence of Thelema in one very importantsense: whereas Freud conceptualized the will of the individual as springing fromthe sex drive, Jung theorized just the opposite—that the sex drive arises fromthe will. This intrinsic drive (will) of the human psyche toward health andwholeness is, according to Jung, the primary motive force, and it’s not hard tosee how this perspective would have impressed Crowley. That said, it seems thatCrowley’s exposure to Jung’s more mature work, such as his advanced treatises onthe psychology of alchemy and other esoteric topics, was minimal. This is ashame, because in my mind the work of these two men continued to converge asthey matured, and I think it is quite likely that Crowley would have appreciatedthe direction Jung took in his later work.Why would you want to undergo psychotherapy as a preliminary or adjunct to themagical path? I think there are several good answers to this, depending on yourunique situation and psychological makeup. First and foremost, you may havespecific symptoms that need to be addressed, such as depression or anxietyissues that interfere with your day-to-day functioning in life, or at leastimpede your happiness and peace of mind. Advances in psychotherapy over the pastfew decades have taught us how to treat many such issues quickly andeffectively, and this is certainly a valid reason to seek out psychotherapyprior to beginning magical studies, or early in your magical career. You don’twant such symptoms to be a distraction, or to sap energy that might otherwise bedevoted to your spiritual work.Aside from alleviating specific symptoms, psychotherapy is broadly useful as ameans of self-exploration. Most magicians place a high value onself-understanding, so it should be no surprise that undertaking such work intherapy could be quite helpful. This goes beyond the sort of understanding thatarises from self-analysis. There is simply something uniquely valuable aboutsitting in a room with someone who is not entwined in your personal life, andhaving them assist you to identify your strengths and weaknesses, your blindspots, and other personality issues and behavior patterns that might elude you.Even if you have a very well developed ability to introspect and discover yourown quirks, I strongly recommend that you spend at least a few months inpsychotherapy with a competent therapist you trust.When you “front-load” your magical work in this way, fortified by theself-knowledge derived from therapy, you reduce the likelihood of trulydebilitating personality patterns undermining your spiritual path later on.There is a tendency for all of us to play to our own strengths and avoid facing(or even becoming aware of) our weaknesses. Therapy is one tool to help ensurewe have done this work consciously, and with due diligence. It won’t remove theobstacles from your spiritual path, but it will increase the chances that youwill be armed with enough self-knowledge to work though them effectively.Therapy is a tool, much like proper education and nutrition—and it would befoolish to avoid using any such tool at our disposal.Along the same lines, Crowley, in his discussion of the work of A∴A∴, emphasizesthe importance of balancing the natural predispositions of the personality—notallowing ourselves simply to cater to our own preferences, choosing only thosepractices that naturally appeal to us. We enforce this policy in A∴A∴ byinsisting that aspirants rigorously engage in the diverse aspects of thecurriculum, especially those in which they are not naturally gifted.Psychotherapy can help uncover these personality predilections in preparationfor the deeper work of the advanced magician.Let’s assume that you have decided to pursue psychotherapy. How can you find atherapist that will be a good match for you? It is crucial to do a good bit ofresearch. You don’t want to waste your time with someone who is not a good matchfor you. Call several therapists, and ask them to tell you about their approachto therapy—often referred to as their theoretical orientation. Ask about theirtraining and experience. If you’re looking for deeper exploratory work, ratherthan mere symptom reduction, you’re probably going to want to look for someonewho self identifies as Jungian, transpersonal or humanistic. These therapistsare more likely to have a holistic view of the human psyche, and to integratespiritually themed topics into the therapy process. Ask them if they arecomfortable discussing non-mainstream spiritual approaches, and explain that youare seeking to integrate your psychological and spiritual exploration.Naturally, this doesn’t mean you will be relying on them for magical advice—fewtherapists will be equipped to suggest an appropriate incense for your upcomingChesed ritual! Nevertheless, you’ll want a therapist who can support you whenyou are in a stage of exploration where meditation, pranayama, or some otherpractice is especially important to your daily routine, and who can help youintegrate this into your other therapeutic work.If you are primarily looking for symptom reduction, or if you have moretroublesome and intrusive symptoms, you may wish to seek out acognitive-behavioral therapist. Research has shown this approach to be veryeffective in providing relief for many of the common symptoms of depression,anxiety and related issues. Psychiatrist David Burns’ book, The Feeling GoodHandbook, is an excellent self-help resource based on the tenets ofcognitive-behavioral therapy.50 [index_split_045.html#filepos664297] The toolsof mental self-control described in the book are absolutely foundational, and Istrongly recommend it as a component of your library, whether or not you pursueformal psychotherapy. See Chapter 30 for much more on cognitive therapyapproaches that may be useful for practicing magicians.Thelemites often ask me, in the context of my background in psychology, aboutthe difference between a visionary state or magical experience that mightinvolve an interaction with a spirit or some other entity, and a pathologicalpsychotic state. One iconic view on this issue was offered by Joseph Campbell inhis book Myths to Live By: “The mystic, endowed with native talents…andfollowing…the instructions of a master, enters the waters and finds he can swim;whereas the schizophrenic, unprepared, unguided, and ungifted, has fallen or hasintentionally plunged and is drowning.”51 [index_split_045.html#filepos664476]How do we differentiate these, and convey to the therapist that you have notlost your marbles? Isn’t the therapist just going to conclude that you are“hearing voices” and must be psychotic? Probably not, as long as you arejudicious in how you talk about these things. A true psychotic disorder involvesa great deal of mental dysfunction and disorganization, and any competenttherapist is trained to look for this. If you go into a therapy session andexplain that you performed an evocation where a spirit spoke to you, but youalso are coming across as a reality-based, functional, competent adult who isintegrating such experiences into your spiritual path, it is unlikely that yourtherapist will be too alarmed. Of course, it is important to work with atherapist who will not be put off by your use of the language of ceremonialmagick, such as references to invoking archangels or summoning spirits intotriangles. Help them understand that you are attempting to describe certainexperiences in poetic and somewhat archaic terms, as a means of deepening yourself-awareness. Now, there are some therapists out there who are simply notgoing to respond in an open-minded way to discussions of these sorts of things,hence the importance of the initial screening process.Magicians also frequently express concerns about how to talk with theirtherapist about their magical path without breaking oaths of secrecy. Often,these folks are simply over-thinking the situation, or rationalizing anunderlying resistance to participation in psychotherapy. It is not thatdifficult to “translate” your oath-bound experiences into different terms. Togive one intentionally ridiculous example: Rather than say that you tooksuch-and-such degree in a certain magical order, and you had to promise not toeat oatmeal, you can simply say that you’ve decided it’s very important for younot to eat oatmeal, and you want the therapist’s assistance in this regard. Atother times, you may be able to reduce the amount of detail discussed with thetherapist, and easily avoid infringing upon your oaths of secrecy.Another issue that inevitably arises any time we are looking for a healthcarepractitioner of any kind is how to pay for it. If you are fortunate enough tohave health insurance, that’s the place to start. Get a list of providers thatare in your area and on your insurance panel, and then start calling andinterviewing them as described above. If you do not have insurance, there may bepublicly funded options available to you. This varies a lot from place to place,but you can start by checking with your city or county to see what services maybe offered. Additionally, some therapists in private practice may have slidingfee scales, or be willing to see some clients pro bono, so be sure to ask aboutthis when you make your initial round of phone calls. Believe me, most magiciansare just the kind of clients that therapists enjoy working with—intelligent,creative, and insightful—so you stand a good chance of persuading a therapist totake you on, even if you have financial constraints.Aside from professional therapy options, our Thelemic communities areincreasingly composed of leaders who have received at least rudimentary trainingin pastoral counseling techniques, via workshops such as the one I developedwith the Psychology Guild of O.T.O. Don’t hesitate to approach your local bodyleaders and clergy for assistance—they are there for you as contact points todiscuss issues of concern. While this isn’t psychotherapy and shouldn’t beconstrued as a replacement for professional help, it is an important resourcewithin our growing communities. Many of our leaders also try to be aware oflocal resources for professional mental health care, and they may be able tohelp connect you with these resources.The issue of psychiatric medication often arises when symptoms are more severe.Understandably, many people have concerns about the potential for over-relianceon these medications within the medical establishment. Others have moral qualmsabout the very concept of taking prescribed medication to change our mentalstate. I can’t deny that over-prescription of medications such asanti-depressants is rampant in our society. Nevertheless, I have seen many of mypatients benefit tremendously from judicious use of these medications,especially when their symptoms severely impair their day-to-day functioning. Ifit is genuinely needed, the proper medication, at the proper dosage, is unlikelyto impair the ability of a magician to perform their Great Work with a clearhead and open heart. Indeed, for those suffering from a true psychiatricdisorder, it may be one of the tools that makes the Work more attainable.In the final analysis, you must take responsibility for your own choices in thisregard, as with any medical care. Your psychotherapist will have valuableinsights into the potential benefits of psychiatric medication, based on youractual history and symptoms. If you decide you want to pursue a medicationevaluation, your therapist can assist you and coordinate care with the medicalpractitioner of your choice. For most people dealing with straightforwardanxiety or depression, this is often a primary care physician, although someclients seek out a psychiatrist to receive specialized care.Recommended Reading:Assagioli, R.

After all, how canwe transform ourselves if we don’t understand the raw material? How can we judgeour own work if we don’t have the proper tools for its inspection? Accordingly,any tool that can aid us in self-knowledge is a worthy tool for the magician.The psychological concepts and processes described by Carl Jung are one such setof tools, and in this chapter we’ll be focusing on one particular aspect of hissystem, known as the anima or animus complex. Put simply, anima is theunconscious feminine aspect of one who consciously identifies as male.Conversely, animus is the unconscious masculine aspect of one who consciouslyidentifies as female.Jung’s model of the psyche is in many ways rooted in the concept of the union ofopposites; most importantly the union of the conscious and unconscious minds.Jung felt the striving for the ego to unite with the anima/animus was aparticularly important expression of an underlying drive toward intrapsychicbalance. This is essentially a ‘hydraulic’ model of the psyche. That is, when wepush contents down into the unconscious (i.e. repression), this results in anequal and opposite push back from the unconscious. The push comes in the form ofdreams, intuitions, and other forms of feedback. When we attend conscientiouslyto these messages from the unconscious, we move toward balance and wholeness;when we ignore or continue to repress these messages, the unconscious tries everharder to get our attention, resulting in obsessions and misdirected drives.We can find similar doctrines expressed as magical principles in our ThelemicHoly Books, confirming that we must unite the higher and lower, the light anddark, the conscious and unconscious, in order to be healthy and whole.

Jungdescribed the anima and animus as being archetypes of the collectiveunconscious, existing independently of a person’s individual experience. Thereis certainly a danger of societal gender stereotypes coming into play wheneverwe try to talk about universal masculine and feminine traits, and Jung himselflikely fell into this trap based on the views of gender that were prevalent inhis time. Yet, we can understand this more flexibly as an expression of a fairlyobvious fact: whatever a person’s conscious gender identification may be, thecomplementary aspects with which he or she does not so much identify will embodyan unexpressed and largely unexplored aspect of self.Jung felt that the development of the anima/animus reflected specific,successive levels of psychological growth for the man or woman. For the man thelevels are said to reflect a deepening connection with emotion, intuition, andspirituality. For the woman, they show a maturing relationship to various formsof power. Again, there is the danger of falling into gender stereotypes, but theunderlying theory may be useful as a way of understanding our deepeningrelationship with unexpressed aspects of self. The reason that the anima/animusis so important to psychological self-exploration and growth is that thepolarity of gender identity is an easily accessible and virtually universalexperience in human life. We can identify fairly readily with a striving toactualize under-developed aspects of self via gender characteristics, whereasother areas of exploration may be harder to grasp at first. They will be soalien as to be almost entirely unconscious; we are conscious of gender, however,and so the anima/animus is an easier “hand-hold” as we begin this exploration.Accordingly, we can understand the anima/animus as an expression of theclassical ‘psychopomp,’ the guide to our own personal underworld—theunconscious—that helps us to begin bridging the conscious and unconsciousworlds, and ultimately to aid us in building the conscious link between the egoand the Self which is so important to wholeness and health. The correspondingprinciple of this ego-Self axis, put in terms of the magical path, is the K & Cof the HGA. It is very important to understand that I am not saying that the HGAis the same thing as the anima/animus. What I am saying is that the HGAultimately serves as our primary guide to the unexplored realms of ourpsycho-spiritual selves. The HGA is intimately entwined with the very core ofour being, and any influence it exerts upon the everyday ego has the potentialto bring vibrant insight into who we really are. In this way, the HGA servesmany of the same functions as the anima/animus, but on a more exalted level.Once firmly established and stabilized, the K & C is a direct and open channelto the unconscious, in both its personal and collective manifestations. Giventhe gender polarity of the anima/animus complex, it is perhaps also important tonote that the HGA may or may not be perceived as being of the opposite sex, orof any defined gender at all. The experience of adepts varies widely in thisregard.So, what is the relationship between the anima/animus and the HGA, exactly? Andhow do these tend to function in the unfolding path of the initiate? In onesense, we can see the anima/animus as residing in Yesod. Here, the ‘guide’ tothe unconscious is those initial intuitive and symbolic bread crumbs that are infact foreshadowed elements of the eventual conscious communion with the HGA. Theso-called “vision” of the HGA attributed to Malkuth awakens us to the spiritualreality behind the veil of nature. Most importantly, this is the veil that hasblinded us to our own spiritual reality, beneath the opaque shell of body andpersonality upon which we place so much emphasis in mundane life. At Yesod, webegin to get instruction from the HGA as to the nature of this spiritualreality, veiled in the language of symbols, dreams, astral experiences, andintuition. In this place, the anima/animus is in a very full sense our guide tofurther attainment. Jung felt the anima/animus would often appear in dreams as aguide or friend, and we have literary and mythological reference points for thisas well. For example, the poet Virgil guiding Dante through the underworld inthe Inferno; and the role of the god Hermes as the so-called ‘messenger of thegods’—one who bridges the human and divine worlds—another metaphor for theconscious and unconscious realms. (Notably, Hermes is often depicted asandrogynous, a further connection with the contrasexual nature of theanima/animus.)One of the most common ways in which the anima/animus is visible and potent inour daily lives is through projection onto our love partners, whether actual ormerely desired. The yearning for the other person; the sense that they somehowcomplete or heal us; the intensity of our desire to possess them; all of theseare symptoms of anima/animus projection. The other person symbolizes anunexpressed aspect of self, and if we are not sufficiently aware of thisperceived deficit in ourselves, the intensity of our desire for them willgenerally be directly proportional to our blindness! These situations inevitablylead to disappointment, for the object of our desire—a mere human—can never liveup to our expectation of perfect, divine love.SUGGESTED EXERCISES:> > 1.

The ego is the lens through which weperceive and organize our experiences; if this lens is distorted, cloudy,imbalanced or unduly skewed by bias, prejudice or blind spots, we will notfunction optimally. Obviously, as magicians, we deal with a lot of symbolic,archetypal, and unconscious material that does not have much to do with the ego.This material is dealt with on its own plane through ritual, astral work, andother occult practices. Similarly, when it comes to the ego, we must address iton its own plane.Unfortunately, this is a stumbling block for many magicians. There is a tendencyto gloss over common, dysfunctional habits of thinking, and skip to moreesoteric work. In the process, many magicians overlook the importance of abalanced psyche, thereby undermining the effectiveness of their magical work. Itis a particular manifestation of ego inflation: “I’ve attained to these loftystates of consciousness, therefore my personality doesn’t need any attention.”Yet in reality, all of us have further growth and development to accomplish,regardless of our magical attainment; and none of us are immune to having someblind spots in our day-to-day lives. Cognitive therapy is simply a technology ofdaily mental and magical hygiene at the level of the ego that, I believe, is animportant weapon in any magician’s arsenal.Cognitive therapy, sometimes called cognitive-behavioral therapy, derivesprimarily from the work of psychiatrist Aaron Beck. In the 1960s and 70s, Beckdeveloped his seminal theory on this approach, and his ideas have gone on toradically reshape modern psychotherapeutic technique as we know it. Essentially,the theory says that disturbing emotions such as anxiety, depression, and anger,are fundamentally rooted in habitual negative thought patterns that getengrained in us through our upbringing, and through our day-to-day process oftaking in information from the environment and making decisions about what itmeans. We tend to fall into habits that are unduly skewed toward the negativeside in our views of ourselves, other people, and the world in general. If weget stuck in a rut in terms of these thought patterns, we are more likely tosuffer from depression, anxiety, anger, control issues and all manner ofdysfunctional emotions and behavior patterns.Cognitive therapy is designed to break us out of these destructive habits. Weexamine our thoughts and emotions, being attentive to distorted, irrational, andmaladaptive thinking patterns. We then gradually and progressively replace themwith more realistic, positive and constructive thoughts, actually reprogrammingourselves to think differently. Done properly, this results in permanent andsubstantive improvements in emotion and behavior. Several decades of researchnow exist to support the efficacy of this approach, and nearly allpsychotherapists in practice today have, in one way or another, been influencedby this school of thought.I should emphasize that cognitive therapy is not about pretending bad thingshave not happened, or talking ourselves out of feeling bad about something thatlegitimately should make us feel bad. Rather, cognitive therapy deals with thevarious thoughts and interpretive schema we lay over the top of these negativeevents, thereby exacerbating our negative emotion. Sometimes something badreally has happened, such as the loss of a job. If you feel depressed, angry andfrustrated in this situation, that’s not a cognitive distortion—that’s reality.Often, however we add layers of negative interpretations: “I’ve lost my job andI’ll probably never get another good one. I’ll probably never be hirable in thefield that I want to work in.” And so on. Bad stuff happens, but this kind ofself-talk is optional, and very likely unrealistic.Another category of unnecessary negative emotion occurs when we feel bad notbecause anything at all has happened, but because of what’s going on in ourhead. A classic example of this is when we get upset because we think we knowwhat someone is thinking about us. We imagine they are thinking they don’t likeus, or that they are criticizing us, and so on. We then tend to get mad at them,but the fact is we don’t have any evidence about what they are thinking. We havestirred ourselves up into an emotional place just by imagining that we know whatthey are thinking.Psychiatrist David Burns, who studied with Aaron Beck, is one of the mostimportant contemporary authors and lecturers on cognitive therapy. In hisexcellent book The Feeling Good Handbook, he classifies the most commoncognitive distortion patterns into ten categories. Let’s review these ten commoncognitive distortions and go into a bit of detail about each one, because theseare the things you will be working with on a day-to-day basis if you incorporatethis approach into your magical toolbox. For each of these distorted thinkingpatterns, I will describe its basic nature, and then give you some suggestionsfor ways to overturn the pattern; that is, to punch a hole in the distortedthinking and shift it to a more realistic and constructive set of thoughts.1. All-or-Nothing thinking. A situation is seen in black-and-white terms. If youdon’t get a perfect score on a test, you tell yourself you’ve failed completely.If a friend doesn’t support you on a particular issue, she is a terrible friend.To overturn this cognitive distortion, ask yourself if there is a gray area—amore moderate way of looking at the situation, without resorting to extremes.Does the situation really have to been seen in terms of extremes, or have I justchosen to think about it this way?2. Jumping to Conclusions. You imagine worst-case scenarios about how anupcoming event is likely to unfold, in spite of the lack of evidence for thenegative outcome. The boss gives you a so-so performance evaluation and youconclude you will never get promoted. Your partner has been quiet and withdrawnlately, and you conclude that he or she doesn’t love you anymore. You jump pastfacts (or lack thereof) into fears about the situation (the “mind-reading”mentioned earlier is a sub-category of jumping to conclusions). To challengethis pattern, ask yourself if there is any evidence that the outcome is reallylikely. Has it really happened that often in the past? Once you are aware of atendency to jump to conclusions, it may be easier to avoid undue anxiety bycatching yourself doing it.3. Magnification. This is also known as catastrophizing. “If my spouse left me,life wouldn’t be worth living anymore. I might as well just end it all.” “If Idon’t get to be Deacon pretty soon, I won’t be able to contribute to the Lodgeand it’s just going to go downhill from here.” You underestimate your ownstrengths and exaggerate the gravity of the situation. To challenge thispattern, ask yourself about evidence for the likelihood of the feared outcome.Also, remind yourself of how you have adapted to similar adverse circumstancesin the past. For example, if you fear the loss of a relationship, remindyourself about how you have bounced back from prior failed relationships. Howwould you really cope if the relationship ended? Chances are, you would hurt fora while, then move on to a better relationship.4. Overgeneralization. The hallmark of this pattern is the use of words like‘always’ and ‘never.’ For example, you are working on a project at your localbody and someone comes in late. You think to yourself that they are always late.Well, they are probably not always late. Perhaps they are frequently late, butif you talk to yourself using words like ‘always’, you are going to be moreupset than if you use more measured terminology. Your choice of words matters,even when you’re only talking to yourself! Another example: you make a mistakeand you say to yourself, “I can’t do anything right.” True, the mistake wasmade; but you are talking to yourself as if the mistake is a pervasive characterflaw, and that’s almost certainly not the case. With cognitive therapy, you notonly teach yourself to respond more positively, but also more realistically andconstructively.5. Mental Filter. This is a sort of tunnel vision where you have a negativebelief about yourself, another person, or a situation, and you pick out detailsin your experience that seem to confirm the existing negative belief—nothingelse gets in. You get several compliments at work, but then at the end of theday one person has a critical thing to say to you and that’s what you focus onall night. You’re not thinking about the fifteen people who said nice things toyou, you are thinking about the one person who said something negative. To dealwith that distortion, ask yourself what you might be overlooking. Challengeyourself to look for counter-examples, to help you see the whole picture in amore balanced way.6. Discounting the Positive. This is similar to Mental Filter. With this patternyou actually take note of positive events, but you explain them away. Someonecompliments you, and instead of taking it in as a legitimate observation youbrush it off, thinking “They are just trying to get something from me,” or “Theysay that to everybody.” You find some way to make it not count. One way tochallenge this pattern is to imagine that a friend has come to you and describeda similar situation. You would probably reassure your friend that the complimentthey had received was genuine and deserved, and you would encourage them toaccept it rather than writing it off. Now take your own advice! Another way tochallenge this pattern is to remind yourself that, most likely, the actualevidence in front of you is the compliment itself, and the negative side is onlyin your head.7. Emotional Reasoning. You treat feelings as if they are facts. Your spouse isten minutes late coming home, and you start to worry that he or she has been inan accident. So far, this is simply jumping to a conclusion. However, once yourbody hears your mind saying something bad has happened, your body starts to pumpadrenaline, and you start to feel a very tangible, bodily sensation youassociate with fear. Since humans have evolved to interpret these emotional cuesin the body as signs of actual danger, you conclude if you’re feeling this way,true danger must surely be present. Yet, there is absolutely no evidence ofanything being amiss—just a vicious cycle of negative thoughts andfight-or-flight bodily arousal.One thing you can do is to challenge this pattern is to force yourself to bemore factually based in your conclusions. Once again, the magic(k) bullet is toask yourself what evidence you have that supports your fear. Almost certainly,there will be none. Look for positive counter-examples from the past, oralternate explanations: Your spouse has been late before, and it wasn’t aterrible accident; he or she was simply delayed by traffic or errands. Feelingsaren’t necessarily facts. Now, of course, emotions are one piece of data our egouses to understand and respond to the environment; but when we give undue weightto emotional responses, we can easily lose sight of more reality-basedperceptions of our situation.8. ‘Should’ Statements. You feel there is something you are obligated to do; orthat someone else is obligated to do. You have expectations about the way theworld is supposed to work or the way people are supposed to behave. Then, whensomething doesn’t turn out the way you think it should, you react with anger,resentment, or shame. Common self-statements along these lines include: “Peopleshould be more considerate of one another,” or “I should have done better orknown better.” The basic remedy here is to remember that just because you thinksomething should happen, that doesn’t mean that it is a law of nature. This canbe a pretty subtle thought process. We build in many expectations in day-to-dayliving based on what we wish would happen, reflecting calcified beliefs aboutthe way the world ought to work. It takes courage and persistence to root ourhabitual illusions in this regard.9. Labeling. Labeling is essentially an extreme form of Overgeneralizing. Basedon a limited set of behaviors, you apply a label to yourself or to others thatis unfairly objectifying or dehumanizing. For example, someone treats you poorlyon a given occasion and you write them off as a ‘jerk’ or a ‘bitch’; or you makea mistake and tell yourself you are a ‘loser’. These labels limit your abilityto see the subtle strengths and weaknesses in yourself or others—to appreciatethe humanity beneath the label. They also make it harder to change yoursituation, because you have conceived your world in terms of conceptualboxes—one box is full or jerks, and the other box is full of non-jerks.Where is the opportunity for growth or change in such a worldview? Instead ofapplying a label, ask yourself: what are the specific behaviors I dislike inmyself or others? Remind yourself that you, the other person, and everyone elsein the world behaves badly sometimes. Maybe you don’t need to be soblack-and-white in your characterization of the situation. Can you put yourselfin their shoes and see how they might behave problematically, without meritingan intractable stamp of defectiveness?10. Personalization and Blaming. Something negative has occurred and you eithertake it personally (personalization), or assume it must be someone’s fault(blaming). “My co-worker didn’t smile when I spoke to her this morning. What didI do wrong?” “That Mass was really low-energy. That stupid Deacon always screwsthings up!” There is a natural desire to explain the universe in terms of causeand effect, and sometimes, in the heat of the moment, it is more comforting toconclude that someone is to blame, even if it’s ourselves. But once again,conceptual ‘boxes’ like this make us less likely to consider other explanationsfor why things have occurred. It makes us motivated to take constructive action,or to understand the subtleties of the problem, and it binds us into a narrowview of the situation. To challenge this pattern, look for alternateexplanations: maybe that co-worker who didn’t smile at you just got some badnews, and their response had nothing to do with you. Perhaps the Mass was lessthan stellar because everyone was tired from the initiations the day before, andnot because any individual was to blame.Practical SuggestionsHow can you put all these concepts to constructive use as a magician? I suggestthat each time you have a strong and significant disturbing emotion—and this islikely to be at least once a day—you make an entry in a ‘mood log.’ This mightsimply be included in your magical diary. In the log, you write down thethoughts that are flying around in your head, no matter how irrational theymight seem. These will likely include a good bit of distorted thinking. Next,you identify which cognitive distortions are present in the thoughts, and comeup with a rational response. Use the challenging questions suggested in thediscussion above. Through vigilance and repetition, you will increase yourability to catch the negative thought patterns soon after they arise, andreplace them with more constructive, realistic, and positive responses.Eventually, you will truly reprogram yourself, and the rational thoughts willbecome your new ‘default’ mode of operation. In my opinion, every magician, nomatter how psychologically healthy they feel, should spend at least a few monthsdoing daily journaling of this kind. You will gain invaluable insight into yourthought patterns and the way they affect your emotions; and this becomes anessential part of your scientific record.You can also use these techniques when you are planning a magical working. It isvery important to consider the psychological conditions that led you to theconclusion that a working is necessary. If your ego is unduly clouded withcognitive distortions, your decision to undertake a magical working to changeyour situation may be skewed as well. Consider whether there are any purelyemotional reasons for desiring the goal that you have in mind. Ask yourself ifthere are upsetting emotions like anger, frustration, or dissatisfaction withyour life that are driving your desire to do the magick working. Might these bebetter addressed directly, on their own plane, through cognitive therapy?Finally, and perhaps most importantly, if you use these techniques to make sureyour mind is as clear and unbiased as possible, you will be maximally enabled tostay tuned in to that most important inner voice—the voice of True Will and deepconscience—the voice of the HGA, which is the one infallible guide along yourmagical path."},{"pageContent":"CONCLUSIONIt is my dearest hope that the material in this book will be helpful as youprogress along the path of your own unique Great Work.

Its central aim is simply tolead each aspirant toward their own individual attainment, for the betterment ofall humanity. The course of study includes a diversity of training methods, suchas Qabalah, raja yoga, ceremonial magick, and many other traditions. A∴A∴ is notorganized into outer social organizations, fraternities or schools; rather, itis based on the time-tested power of individual teacher-student relationships,under the guidance of the masters of the Inner School. All training and testingis done strictly in accordance with Liber 185 and other foundational documents.Those interested in pursuing admission into A∴A∴ are invited to initiate contactvia the following addresses:A∴A∴PO Box 215483Sacramento, CA 95821www.onestarinsight.org [http://www.onestarinsight.org]The Student phase of preparation for work in A∴A∴ begins by acquiring a specificset of reference texts, notifying A∴A∴ of the same, and studying the texts forat least three months.

AGLA is simply a wordcomprised of the initials of the phrase, “Atah Gibbor Le-Olahm Adonai.”6 The names of the archangels should be intoned, not merely spoken.7 See Chapter V of Magick in Theory and Practice, where Crowley comments in afootnote: “There is a quite different formula in which I is the Father, O theMother, A the Child—and yet another, in which I.A.O. are all fathers ofdifferent kinds balanced by H.H.H., 3 Mothers, to complete the Universe. In athird, the true formula of the Beast 666, I and O are the opposites which formthe field for the operation of A. But this is a higher matter unsuited for thiselementary handbook. See, however, Liber Samekh, Point II, Section J.”8 The name IAO is intoned, not spoken. The correct pronunciation is “Ee-ah-oh.”9 Pronounced “looks.”10This line of text has appeared in various places as either ‘let it fill me’ or‘let it kill me.’ I encourage you to use either reading according to yourpersonal preference.11 Crowley, A.
