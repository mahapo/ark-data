Various ideologies and commodities, religions,and fads compete for your attention. They want your soul, they want your flesh,and worse still they want your money. As the pace of human material progressquickens, each little demon and angel shouts for you to join its parade. Thishas been true for hundreds of years, maybe even thousands of years. These daysthe shouts are louder, and the myth that you can go down all the paths at thesame time is stronger than ever. The good thing about this mishmash is that manyparadigms old and new—well traveled or seldom traversed, ancient or modern,intellectual or simple—are available to the seeker. Many of the paths in the West have their roots in the work of Aleister Crowley.From Scientology to Wicca, from the Rosicrucian Order to the Temple of Set, theFirst Beast’s seeds have grown into a huge forest of magickal, philosophical,and religious trees. Crowley used the term “magick” to distinguish the Work of amagician from a stage conjuror. The spelling adds the eleventh letter of theEnglish alphabet, which signifys (in Crowely’s numerology) “Will”—the force usedand refined by the practice of magick. This book is offered as an aid to somewho wish to further their link to Crowley’s 666 Work; to others it is achallenge to clarify their thinking; to others still, an explanation of theircurrent spiritual and magickal paths. It is not written to offend anyone. It isnot written as an ultimate Word or guide. If it makes you think, I am happy; ifit makes you do, I am happier still. My viewpoint differs from much ofmainstream occultism. I reject the purely pragmatic view of chaos magickians; Idistrust the righteousness of my Right-Hand-Path brethren; and I deny theanything-goes approach of postmodernism. I assert that magick is a road toself-power and mastery over the self and the cosmos. I assert that all may enterour path and that the path of seeking measurable self-chosen goals in the worldis the path of self-training. A Word, as we shall see, is an encapulization of aworldview. We might, for example, say that Liberty was the Word of ThomasJefferson. As one aligns one’s self with a Word, the Word both informs the souland strengthens the deeds of the person who is learning/practicing/furthering itor—as magickians say—“Working” with it. Thelema, a New Testament Greek word, isusually translated as “Will”—but in its original context meant a strongly helddesire. If I say, “I will go to work tomorrow,” a different word would be usedbecause no matter what, I am going to be there. If I say, “It is my will thatyou dine with me,” then I would use the word Thelema. For the magickian, Thelemabegins with self-knowledge (I know I want to eat with you) but grows into a Lawof the Cosmos (because I desire it, it will happen, even if you think it won’t).The word Thelema is my notable in the Lord’s Prayer—“thy Will be done on Earthas in Heaven.” Crowley’s system changes this into “My Will be done!” Thisbecomes the essence of the Left-Hand Path, although he lacked the modern usageof that terminology. For a great understanding of the Left-Hand Pathhistorically, the interested reader should consult Stephen Flowers’ Lords of theLeft-Hand Path. A Magus is a human that has become identified with a concept, an incarnation ofit on Earth. One could call Thomas Jefferson a Magus because the concepts hespoke of have become an ideal pursued on this Earth by many. Consider his wish,“Let us in education dream of an aristocracy of achievement arising out of ademocracy of opportunity.” I recognize that Thelema is the expression of aself-trained elite and that such an elite can and should create a civilizationinformed of their desire, joy, and love for mankind. Aleister Crowley by hischoices and methodology led to the re-creation of the Left-Hand Path in theWest. This book focuses on the central magickal moment of Crowley’s life: thereception of The Book of the Law in Cairo in 1904. Crowley reached a crossroads in his life in 1904. He had been a “bad boy”playing at the magickal arts in the British Initiatory group the Golden Dawn.There are numerous biographies of Crowley covering this period of his life (fortwo of the best see Resources and Suggested Reading). But a few words about theCairo Working are in order. Crowley had decided to settle down and become aresponsible sort. He allowed himself one last fling. He decided to show his newwife a demonstration of magick by invoking air elementals in the King’s Chamberof the Great Pyramid sometime before the Spring Equinox 1904. The invocationstirred up something in his wife Rose, and she began having trance states filledwith utterances of “They are waiting for you.” Crowley had his first experienceof Thelema at that moment, his desire had actually changed the subjectiveuniverse of another human—what he really wanted was what was coming into being.Rose led him (we shall see more of this below) to a funerary stele in the FrenchEgyptologial Museum. Its number, 666, was the same taunt his pious mother hadmade of him. The Stele of Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu was a magickal device that allowedits owner to express his Will on Earth though his life had ended. It invokedvarious gods, especially Horus Behdety—Horus as War God—and Montu, a god whopossessed elements of Horus’s rival, Set. At the crossroads in our lives whenthe flame of day-to-day consciousness burns low, we can experiencesynchronicities—much as one can see the stars at night—even though the stars arethere during the day. What separates magickians from regular people is that theyact upon these messages from the other Hidden side of the universe. Emboldenedby these signs Crowley used a Greco-Egyptian spell, “the Invocation of theHeadless One,” to contact the gods. The gods replied—for three days they gavehim the three chapters of The Book of the Law. Crowley was not to become arespectable citizen, he was to change the world by teaching the primacy ofdesire. His deeds and words created attitudes that changed the world, not merelythe occult world—he introduced sex and drugs to the West as transformativemethods, a strong ethos of personal liberty, and the notion that magick is notabout putting a hex on your neighbor’s cows—but a quest to change the level ofBeing a human possessed. I will consider the two paths—magick white and black—and Aleister Crowley’sidentification with the First Beast of the Christian book of Revelation. I willevaluate the latter in light of Carl Jung’s essay on the Antichrist. To do thisthoroughly I will break some taboos on the way, such as commenting on The Bookof the Law. For some of my readers this will release a good deal of energy intheir psyches, so strictly speaking this book is a talisman and should betreated accordingly. This book began as two volumes designed for the membershipof the Temple of Set. The Temple of Set is the largest example of thetranscendental Left-Hand Path in the West. It is a group dedicated to magickaland philosophical self-empowerment and evolution. The Temple teaches the art ofmaking desire into Law. The first part of the work focuses on The Book of theLaw, featuring commentaries by Ipsissimus Michael Aquino, founder of the Templeof Set, the most sophisticated Left-Hand-Path group in the West, and by myself,Ipsissimus Don Webb, former high priest of the Temple of Set. Aquino treatsCrowley as an initiate looking for but never finding the Left-Hand Path. I seeCrowley as having discovered the Left-Hand Path in his philosophy and practice,but being hindered by certain ideas received from the Golden Dawn. The Golden Dawn was a British pseudomasonic group who taught self-improvement bythe use of magickal exercises—derived from Egyptian, European, and Americansources. The American source was P. B. Randolph. The Golden Dawn gave Crowley alanguage to use—a way to think about the world. The Golden Dawn’s central rolemodel was Osiris, the Egyptian god who dies and is reborn (think Balder, Christ,Attis, etc.). Life was a process of preparing for death. Crowley changed thisformula and overthrew Osiris—life is for experiencing the purest form ofLife—strong joy. Gloomy Osiris returned to his realm and bright young Horusstrode forth by day. The second part of the book consists of thirty-one essays that I wrote on thecentennial of Crowley’s birth as a series of lessons within the Temple of Set. It is widely presumed that the Thelemic path is simply a hedonistic orlibertarian creed. It is likewise often assumed that the Thelemic path is one ofunion with the cosmos through the destruction of the ego. Neither of thesenotions is true, although Crowley never fully understood the latter. If you knowany Thelemite long enough you will hear, “‘Do what thou wilt shall be the wholeof the Law’ doesn’t mean ‘Do whatever the hell you want’!” The formula of thecoming into being of The Book of the Law established the need for disciplinefrom the more perfect, more permanent part of the self as a guide for theunification and empowerment of the whole of the self. When Crowley undertook toperform the invocation for receiving the Book he quarreled with his wife, Rose,about formulas and method, but realizing that he was dealing with a mystery,obeyed her promptings as opposed to obeying his surface ego. The second chapter of the Book is a quarrel between Crowley and the Author. Whena human receives a text from a source beyond him-or herself, the text remains apartial mystery to its auditor. The text is a collaboration by the human and adivine Unknown. Crowley identified this source as an entity he called “Aiwass”(Crowley uses various spellings). He identified Aiwass with Satan, Shaitan, andSet: the archetype of the demonic intiator. In the text, Crowley argues for thepath of sorrow and dissolving the self to maintain the worldview of the oldgods. The Author argues for the path of joy and the immortalizing of the Self.With those Words, and that moment of Crowley’s self submitting not to a god butto his Self, the Left-Hand Path was remanifested in the West. The roots of thishad been developing in the words of Friedrich Nietzsche and the magick ofPaschal Beverly Randolph and the yoga-tantra blend that Pierre Bernard hadbrought to the American West Coast, and even more strongly in Crowley’s lifewhen he chose the Left-Hand Path in one of its most ancient shrines in 1901.Let’s look at Crowley’s choice, the nature of magick white and black, and endwith the puzzling choice of his self-identification with the Beast 666. THE PATHS AND BHAVANI Crowley lived in an era when the term Left-Hand Path meant “selfish bad guy.”The term had been introduced into English by Edward Bulwer-Lytton in his occultnovel Zanoni. The title character had achieved personal immortality throughLeft-Hand-Path practices in Chaldean times but lost his immortality by gaininghuman love. The term became a handy way to denounce magickians one didn’t like;Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, founder of the Theosophical Society, labeled Randolphwith it, and Crowley himself used it to describe English trance artist andoccultist Austin Osman Spare. However, the term refers in the main to a branchof thought coming from the Indian Middle Ages when the “Path of the Left”referred to a goddess-centric path that uses antinomian practices coupled withmagickal development as a way for becoming an immortal, sovereign soul. Thefollower of the Left-Hand Path does not wish to dissolve in the ocean of theuniverse but to taste that notion. He or she accepts division from the universefor the “sake of love.” This notion is reflected in the central tenets of TheBook of the Law and is the guiding notion of the initiatory paths of the OrdoTempli Orientis (OTO) and the Aimage [images/00004.jpg]Aimage[images/00004.jpg]. Crowley created the Aimage [images/00004.jpg]Aimage[images/00004.jpg] as a personal expression of his revelation. The funkypunctuation are “pyramids of fire” showing the sacred nature of the group. TheOTO was an existant German pseudomasonic group that recognized Crowley’s Wordand served to spread that Word to the world. The Aimage [images/00004.jpg]Aimage[images/00004.jpg] is about transforming individuals in the knowledge who willact upon the world around them to further Life and Liberty. The OTO exists tospread Crowley’s ideas directly. Together they seek human transformation—notunlike Isaac Asimov’s First and Second foundations. Let’s look at a clear, academic definition of the path and consider when and howCrowley entered it. We will be able to see the First Beast not through theVictorian misunderstanding of the Left-Hand Path, but through the scholarshipand philosophy that Crowley himself reestablished in the West. Stephen EdredFlowers, Ph.D., describes the nature of the Left-Hand Path in his seminal Lordsof the Left-Hand Path: > Essentially, the Left-Hand Path is the path of nonunion with the objective> universe. It is the way of isolating consciousness within the subjective> universe and, in a state of self-imposed psychic solitude, refining the soul> or psyche to ever more perfect levels. The objective universe is then made to> harmonize itself with the will of the individual psyche instead of the other> way around. In the Indian versions of the Left-Hand Path, the force or energy of the cosmosis female, operating on the point consciousness of the male. Humans have a largefield of consciousness. At one end humans are the totality of their subjectiveuniverse—holding cultural and biological knowledge, memories, currentimpressions—you hold the universe within you. On the other hand, a single pointof consciousness makes your decisions. Right now your point consciousness isfocused on this book. In a few minutes it may be focused on a cheeseburger. Allmental training is either about becoming open to the all and everything of yourBeing, or to focusing your mind on a single goal. Crowley realized that both ofthese are two sides of the same coin, and the purpose of it is to focus the alland everything through a single point of Self. To borrow a phrase from Blake,“To see a world in a grain of sand, And a heaven in a wild flower, Hold infinityin the palm of your hand, And eternity in an hour.” Crowley recreated thatsystem with the Shakti being Nuit and the male center being Hadit. He began hisconnection with the Left-Hand Path by performing a sacrifice in 1901 to theLeft-Hand Path goddess Bhavani at a temple forbidden to Europeans. There everyvalue that he represented—a privileged male educated in the public schools ofthe world’s largest colonial power—made a break into a universe of his ownvalues. The universe was female and vast, his point of consciousness small, yetpure, and potent. Crowley had always projected the universe on women and sought women to constructhis subjective universe. His mother had called him the Beast 666, so the seedsof a surrounding and naming mother were programmed into his consciousness as achild. When he visited one of the world’s oldest Left-Hand-Path shrines, herecast himself as a rebel separate from the universe, which is both mother andlover, and he took up the quest of refining himself to be the perfect lover andlord to that universe. His rebellion to his class, religious upbringing, andimperialism was complete, and his rewards would never reintegrate him into theworld he made the decision to stand in opposition to. In this he likewiseremanifested the original Left-Hand Path. Crowley’s definition of white and black magick was a simple moral one. Whitemagick was for good effect, black for evil. However, all men think they do good,whether they are Mahatma Gandhi or Adolph Hitler. This book uses a more modernunderstanding of those terms. White magick is the magick of seeking and unitywith the gods of mankind. Its purest form is prayer. Black magick seeks toevolve the Self as an entity distinct from the cosmos. Black magick is thetechnique of the Left-Hand Path whereby immortality is achieved. Crowley’s wishto eliminate the sleep of Osiris with the active movement of Horus Behedit, thegod honored in the Stele of Revealing, is pure black magick. FOR ALEISTER SO LOVED THE WORLD In “A Psychological Approach to the Dogma of the Trinity,” Jung wrote that if anarchetypal image “is not recognized consciously, then it appears from behind inits wrathful form as the dark son of chaos, the evildoer, an Antichrist.” Guidedby his mother’s superstitions Crowley seized to unpin the Antichrist in the samemanner that contemporary Satanists seize the image of Satan. They take onthemselves the place where their work must appear in the minds of theunawakened. Crowley chose a role that dates back beyond Christian and Jewishsources to Canaanite mythology—that of the enemy king, the threat to order, thebringer of chaos. Armed with an understanding of the Antichrist gleaned fromGerman philosopher and classical philologist Friedrich Nietzsche, Crowleyaccepted the role of the human who was to begin to finish the Æon of Osiris, aswell as to begin the start of the Æon of Horus. An “æon” is a world-age. Æons are the collections of humans and their thoughtsand deeds focused on a single ruling principle. For example, we could speak ofthe Æon of Marxism beginning with Karl Marx’s thoughts and then containing allof the resulting consequences from the battle of Stalingrad to the Cuban crisis.Crowley became the archetype of the finisher, of Loki, whose name means“Finisher,” or of the bringer of confusion, Set. Crowley understood mankind’sneed for such an archetype. In this he transformed himself from a small ego thatreflected on its most literal needs to someone in love with (and identifiedwith) humanity; he needed to take on its evolution as his own. He acted out oflove for all of mankind. By offering the path of individual empowerment, Crowleyoverthrew the gods of mankind. They lost their ability to sing to sleep thehumankind that produces the nightmares of history and became the tools that thepsyches of mankind had invented them for in the first place. THIS BOOK AS A KEY TO THE BOOK OF THE LAW The current volume is the Work of two ipsissimi to further Crowley’s love forthe world. It consists of two parts: “Centers of Pestilence,” which includesblack magickal commentaries on Crowley’s masterwork, The Book of the Law, and“Aleister Crowley: The Force and the Fire,” a series of thirty-one essays Iwrote for the Temple of Set in the year of Crowley’s centennial. It is my hopethat this book gives fresh access to the Work of the First Beast, that it bringsenergizing doubt in place of stultifying faith, and that it prompts you to seekafter the mysteries of Thelema in the dark light of your very own self. Any Workthat creates an æon will have several valid keys, in fact the effect of a Wordis to create its own keys. "},{"pageContent":"Liber Legis:The Book of the Law Commentary by Michael A. Aquino FOREWORD BY DON WEBB VI° TEMPLE OF SET During Aleister Crowley’s lifetime he created two line-by-line commentaries onThe Book of the Law. When dealing with a divine text, both the evaluator andlater scholars may find such paced analysis at once precise and practical,identifying and highlighting concepts that might otherwise be confused oroverlooked altogether. This volume includes two post-Crowley commentaries, by Michael Aquino andmyself, both following our initiations as Ipsissimi in 1979 and 2002respectively. This is material and indeed critical, because absent suchinitiation we would both be unable to contextualize the Task and Curse of aprevious Magus from a transæonic perspective. What we attempt to do herein is not to showcase our own initiatory insight butrather to bring The Book of the Law into an intelligible and practical focus fornot just fellow initiates but conventional students of philosophy andmetaphysics as well. Æons and their Words are not meant to be obscure orprivileged; they are lights in the darkness for all seekers of truth and wisdom. If one or the other of our commentaries seems bewildering or overwhelming atfirst reading, set it aside and pursue other avenues of your education andinitiation. Such experience will give you additional keys to apply to thesedoors. Remember that this is a personal adventure, at once enriching, exciting,and enjoyable. You are not here to pass anyone else’s test, announced orimplied. Rather, as Crowley admonished in his Confessions, you are here “to cutyour own way through the jungle.” In 1969 the Second Beast, like the First Beast, began his initiation through apreexisting institution, the Church of Satan, which espoused the principle, orWord, of Indulgence. Also like Crowley, Aquino was eventually driven beyond thisinitial environment to a more energetic and mysterious one: that of the Æon andTemple of Set in 1975. The Book of Coming Forth by Night, which came into beingon the North Solstice 1975, not only extended human evolutionary potentialbeyond known horizons of consciousness, but also reached back into the Æon ofHorus to link these new vistas with keys and currents set in motion 71 yearspreviously in Cairo. I was consecrated to the High Priesthood of Set upon Aquino’s 1996 retirement.My Task as a new Magus V° was one of enhancing and refining the still-unfoldingÆon of Set, not superseding it. Similarly I see in the Æon of Horus its ownstill-developing energies, which, in harmonious complement to and synthesis withthe Setian current, will inspire initiates to that greatest Music of theSpheres, the samtaui of the Majesties of Set and Horus. Let us now begin this adventure with Michael Aquino’s Commentary. "},{"pageContent":" The Book of the Law image [images/00005.jpg] The Michael Aquino Commentary "},{"pageContent":" Liber Legis The Book of the Law > - transcribed by Aleister Crowley (6)=[5] G.'.D.'. Cairo, Egypt, 1904 CE> - commentary by Michael A. Aquino VI° Temple of Set Santa Barbara,> California, 1979 CEIntroduction On March 18, 1904 Aleister Crowley and his wife Rose visited the old BoulakMuseum in Cairo. She drew his attention to the XXVI Dynasty funerary stele ofthe Theban priest Ankh-f-n-Khonsu. Represented on this stele are two Egyptian god-figures and a winged solar disc,which Crowley identified respectively as Nuit, Ra-Hoor-Khuit, and Hadit. Hethought Ra-Hoor-Khuit to be a form of Horus the Younger (the Egyptological termfor the son of Osiris and Isis in the Osirian mythos) and thus the symbol of an“æon of theson” to follow those of the mother-goddess (Isis) and the father-god(Osiris). He also believed Hadit to be “Heru-pa-kraath” (Harpokrates), theinfant form of Horus the Younger. He identified Nuit [correctly] as the Egyptiangoddess of the sky. An examination of the hieroglyphs on the stele - called by Crowley the “Stele ofRevealing” - indicates that it was not conceived or executed according to theOsirian mythos [save that the dead priest is referred to as “an Osiris”, i.e. adead soul]. “Ra-Hoor-Khuit” is correctly translated to “Ra-Harakte, Master of the Gods”.This is a form of HarWer (Horus the Elder - the Great Horus of pre-Osirianlegend), literally “Horus of the Horizon” in his solar aspect of Xepera.Ra-Harakte had been the judge of the dead in non-Osirian Egypt, and he was alsocast as the champion of Set in the Osirian-mythos trial between Set and Horusthe Younger. The curious term “Hadit” is simply the Islamic word for a divinely-inspiredutterance of any sort; hence it is not found on the XXVI Dynasty monument. The“Hadit” disc is hieroglyphically identified on the stele as “Behdety”, a form ofHorus the Elder worshipped at Behdet in the eastern Nile delta. Summarily theStele of Revealing is not based upon the Osirian triad at all; its themes arethose of a Theban Sun-cult based upon Horus the Elder and Ra-Harakte. This casts an entirely new light on the Book of the Law that Crowley transcribedon April 8-10, 1904. He interpreted the chapters and verses of this documentaccording to his understanding of the figures on the Stele of Revealing, andthese interpretations have been published as The Law is for All (Ed. Regardie),Magical and Philosophical Commentaries on the Book of the Law (Ed. Symonds &Grant), and The Commentaries of AL (Ed. Motta). Crowley’s account of the CairoWorking - the transcription of the Book of the Law -is contained in The Equinox,The Confessions, and The Equinox of the Gods. The concepts introduced in the Book of Coming Forth by Nightmake possible anentirely new analysis of the Book of the Law. This should be understood neitheras an æsthetic criticism of Crowley’s comments nor as an attempted distortion ofthem. It is rather the result of the perceptual vantage-point of the Æon of Setas opposed to that of the Æon of Horus. The original Comment to the Book of theLaw forbade all discussion or criticism of that text, not unjustifiably on thepresumption that initiates below the grade of Magus could not evaluate it withÆonic perspective. As an Ipsissimus I assert a trans-æonic perspective, hencethe right - even responsibility - to comment accordingly on the Book of the Law. A Note About Æons ... As far as most occultists are aware, references to æons began with AleisterCrowley’s much-advertised Æon of Horus, which he proclaimed to have followedfirst the Æon of Isis (roughly pre-Christian paganism) and then that of Osiris(roughly 2,000 years of Christianity). Since Crowley’s understanding of Egyptianmythology was essentially that of the Osiris/Isis/Horus trinity, this tiedWestern civilization up into a nice, neat package. Not only was Crowley responsible for bringing about the Æon of Horus, we aretold, but that of Osiris as well -in a previous incarnation as the High Priestof Osiris [and Priestess of Isis] Ankh-f-n-khonsu. The detailed story of this istold in his memoir of that incarnation, “Across the Gulf”, in Equinox #I-7: > But Thoth the mighty god, the wise one, with his ibis-head and his nemyss of> indigo, with his Ateph crown and his phœnix wand and with his ankh of emerald,> with his magic apron in the three colors; yea, Thoth, the god of wisdom, whose> skin is of tawny orange as though it burned in a furnace, appeared visibly to> all of us. And the old Magus of the Well, whom no man had seen outside his> well for night threescore years, was found in the midst; and he cried with a> loud voice, saying, “The Equinox of the Gods!” > And he went about to explain how it was that Nature should no longer be the> center of man’s worship, but man himself, man in his suffering and death, man> in his purification and perfection. And he recited the Formula of the Osiris> as follows, even as it hath been transmitted unto us by the Brethren of the> Cross and Rose unto this day ... In his own writings Crowley does not indicate where he came by this concept of“æons” or exactly what is meant by it. A little detective work, however, takesus back to the days of the Golden Dawn and the writing of a book entitledEgyptian Magic by Florence Farr, Scribe of the G.'.D.'., in 1896. This book,part of a 10-volume series Collectanea Hermetica edited by W.W. Westcott,contained a very interesting chapter called “The Gnostic Magic of Egypt”: > Let us first consider the essential principles of Gnosticism, which are> briefly as follows: > First - A denial of the dogma of a personal supreme God, and the assertion of> a supreme divine essence consisting of the purest light and pervading that> boundless space of perfected matter which the Greeks called the Pleroma. This> light called into existence the great father and the great mother whose> children were the æons or god-spirits. That is to say from the supreme issues> the nous or divine mind and thence successive emanations, each less sublime> than the preceding. The divine life in each becoming less intense until the> boundary of the Pleroma, or the fullness of God, is reached. From thence there> comes into being a taint of imperfection, an abortive and defective evolution,> the source of materiality and the origin of a created universe, illuminated by> the divine but far removed from its infinitude and perfection. > Now the Gnostics considered that the actual ruler and fashioner of this> created universe and its beings good and evil was the Demiurgos, a power> issuant from sophia or wisdom. By some it was said that the desire of souls> for progression caused the origin of a universe in which they might evolve and> rise to the divine. > The Gnostics definitely believed in the theory of cycles of ascent and return> to the evolutionary progress of worlds, ages, and man; the ascents & descents> of the soul; the pre-existence of all human souls now in worldly life; and the> surety that all souls that desire the highest must descend to matter and be> born of it. They were the philosophical Christians. > The rule of the Christian church, however, fell into the hands of those who> encouraged an emotional religion, destitute of philosophy, whose members> should be bound together by personal ties of human sympathy with an exalted> sufferer and preacher rather than by an intellectual acceptance of high truth. > The Gnostics dissented from the creed then being taught, on the ground of the> inferiority of the hero-worship of Christ to the spiritual knowledge of the> supernal mind, which they considered he taught. > The Gnostics were almost universally deeply imbued with the doctrines of> Socrates and Plato; and a religion of emotion and reverence, combined with> moral platitudes, did not seem to them of a sublimity sufficiently intense to> be worthy to replace the religious mysteries of Egypt, India, and Persia, the> theocracy of the Jews, or the sublime truths hidden in the myths of Greece. In Religion in Ancient History S.G.F. Brandon comments: > In his “First Epistle to the Corinthians” Paul had occasion to contrast his> teaching with that of other systems known to his readers. In so doing he was> led to give this significant account of his own: “Howbeit we speak wisdom> among the perfect: yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this> world, which are coming to naught: but we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery,> even the wisdom that hath been hidden, which God foreordained before the> worlds unto our glory: which none of the rulers of this world knoweth: for had> they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory” (ii. 6-8). > In our official English translations the proper meaning of this passage is> obscured at two crucial points. The Greek word translated as “world” here,> severally in its singular or plural forms, is aion, which does not mean this> physical world or Earth, but “time” or “age”.] > Paul’s use of aion here accordingly shows that he was thinking in terms of an> esoteric system of “worldages” that probably derived ultimately from Iranian> and Babylonian sources, and that in various forms was much in vogue in current> Græco-Roman thought. Next the words translated as “rulers of this world”> (archontes tou aionos toutou) do not refer, as is popularly supposed, to the> Roman and Jewish authorities who were responsible for condemning Jesus to> death. They denote dæmonic beings who were associated with the planets and> believed to govern the lives of men on Earth. As Farr and Brandon both go on to observe, Gnostic Christianity was regarded asa very serious threat to the Christian church and was intensely persecuted. Hadit become prevalent, the 2,000 years might have evolved very differently inWestern civilization - with a very intellectual, philosophical, and initiatoryreligious climate instead of the intolerant, ferocious, and ignorant horror ofdogmatic Christianity. Now we are beginning to see this term æon in a new light, if I may be excusedthe expression. The Æon of Horus is not just a period of time when ideassymbolized by Horus are dominant. Rather it is a Ding an sich, a noumenon:something of purely rational apprehension, not perception by the senses. Thus in what one might term the Lesser Black Magical sense, an æon is simply anattitude which one chooses or is conditioned to adopt. This is what is meant bysaying that different people “exist in different æons”: that a Jew, Christian orMoslem exists in the Æon of Osiris, a Wiccan in that of Isis, and a Thelemite inthat of Horus. Accordingly, while æons are “pyramidal” in sophistication, after the fashion ofPlato’s “pyramid of thought”, there is no reason to consider themtime-sequential, with each new one superseding and obliterating the one beforeit. In an LBM sense, therefore, the population of the world continues overwhelminglyin the grip of the Æon of Osiris, the best intentions of Aiwass notwithstanding.The Æon of Isis is the next influential, followed by that of Horus. The Æon ofSet, highest on the pyramid and most difficult to comprehend and indwell, is themost rarified and elusive of all. As with an initiatory degree/grade system, it would be very difficult if notimpossible to spend all of one’s time in a “higher æon”. When we go about ouraffairs in the profane world, we are usually Osirians, peering with curiosityand vague alarm at ecological activists (Isis) or avant-garde artists (Horus).Yet we experience periods of Isis and Horus too -and, when we wish to, that veryrarefied Æon of Set. Crowley, who suggested that æons were periods of time in “catastrophicsuccession” - I presume in order to more forcefully advance the cause of the Æonof Horus - predicted in the Equinox #I-10 that following the ÆH “will arise theEquinox of Ma, the goddess of justice. It may be a hundred or ten thousand yearsfrom now (1913), for the computation of time is not here as there.” In 1921, inhis “new comment” to Liber Legis, Crowley speculated that the next æon would bethat of Thmaist, third officer in the G.'.D.'. Neophyte ritual. Yet, hecontinued, “It may be presumptuous to predict any details concerning the nextæon after this.” That is essentially my attitude as well. As Magus of the Æon of Set, I am an Eyein that particular Triangle [or Shining Trapezohedron], as it were. The only onewho knows for certain what the next-conceived æon will be, if indeed thereshould be one, would be the Magus or Maga who Utters its word. Above I made reference to æons “in an LBM sense”. There is a “Greater BlackMagical sense” as well: Seen through the lens of GBM, an æon is in fact a living entity, in which itsinitiates are “cells”. This is the secret which the Gnostics brought fromantiquity, and which so frightened the Christian dogmatists. The “god” of an æonis thus a creature of the total magical and philosophical energy of materialbeings who are initiates of that æon, i.e. who are aware that they are“components of the god”. [Are you now beginning to see the ancient origins ofHegel’s concept of an “overmind”?] Understood in this sense, a GBM working is a way of the “part’s” reaching out tocontact, experience, and/or express the “whole”. This is why true GBM is noteven remotely like “prayer” as the profane practice it. Nor is it meremeditation, in which the mind of the meditator merely extends to its own limits.It is the greatest secret, and the greatest fulfillment, of unique existence. Once an æon is apprehended in this way, a great many veils fall away, a greatmany mysteries of what magic is/ why it works are revealed, and indeed theentire “why” of human consciousness is explained. All you need is the nœsis toperceive it. Don’t be concerned if you don’t attain such nœsis immediately. Itis there; and when you are ready for it, It will be ready for you. ... And About Initiatory States of Being The concept of magical æons is further involved - one might say entangled - withthe three highest designations of Western initiation: Magister Templi, Magus,and Ipsissimus. These and their preliminaries are usually attributed to the Hermetic Order ofthe Golden Dawn (G.'.D.'.) in turn-of-the-20th-century London.1[CR%21XKH88GDSZ52D3DFGXSBK3FPMAAQE_split_022.html#filepos905602] The G.'.D.'.never conferred the three senior grades (as they were called), reserving them tothe mysterious/supernatural \"Secret Chiefs\"; they were thus held to be \"astral\"grades beyond incarnated human attainment. When Aleister Crowley founded his G.'.D.'.-superseding A.'.A.'. in 1907, he madeit possible for incarnates to attain the astral by a process ofconsciousness-transformation he referred to as \"crossing the Abyss\". Now thegrade of Magister Templi (8)=[3] came into focus as characterizing one capableof completely comprehending (\"Understanding\") an æon. A Magus (9)=[2] identifiesone who creates (\"Utters the Word of') a completely new æon, or whosignificantly expands or enhances apprehension of an existing one. So far so good, but Crowley left Ipsissimus (10)=[1] floundering in vagueness:\"It is beyond all this and beyond all comprehension of those of lower degrees.\"2[CR%21XKH88GDSZ52D3DFGXSBK3FPMAAQE_split_022.html#filepos906250] What the Templeof Set later attributed to it is both simple and self-evident: the attainment ofa perspective above and beyond all existing æons, enabling the Ipsissimus toharmoniously and beneficially integrate them.3[CR%21XKH88GDSZ52D3DFGXSBK3FPMAAQE_split_022.html#filepos906478] Where the Book of the Law is concerned, what this means is that, as theinauguration and Utterance of the Word of the Æon of Horus, it should [in 1904]have instantly redefined Crowley as a Magus. Nevertheless he did not claim evenMagister Templi until 1909, nor Magus until 1914. He never explained thisawkward - and glaring - discrepancy. Moreover he did not initiatorily formalizethe Æon until the founding of the A.'.A.'. in 1907, nor publish the Book of theLaw itself until The Equinox #1-7 in 1912. And so with the Book of the Law we do not have a nice, neat package ofhuman/divine interaction, but a collage of attention and reflection whichgradually emerged only over several decades. The First Chapter > 1. Had! The Manifestation of Nuit.> This chapter is a verbalization of the Nuit-neter as perceived by Crowley.> [Throughout this commentary the term “neter” (hieroglyphic ntr) is used in the> Pythagorean/Platonic sense as a first and/or comprehensive Universal> principle.] As the Egyptian sky-neter, Nuit was portrayed as the mother of> Set, Horus the Elder, Ra, and Xepera. > 2. The unveiling of the company of heaven.> The Book of the Law constitutes an explanation of concepts derived from these> five neteru. HarWer is completely manifest, as is necessary for the Equinox of> the Æon of Horus. The Xeper-neter is partially revealed through passages in> the text dealing with transformation and evolution. The neter of Set would> remain unrecognized and enigmatic, its presence but not identity sensed, until> the announcement of the Æon of Set on the North Solstice of X/1975. > 3. Every man and every woman is a star.> A star is a completely-contained environment of matter, energy, and the> process of conversion between the two. Once formed, a star is an island of> existence unique unto itself amidst the Universe, interacting comparatively> remotely with other celestial bodies and phenomena through radiation and> gravitation. The constitution of each uniquely self-conscious human being> (homo sapiens) is similar; one’s interactions with other beings and with one’s> environment have the capacity to be dwarfed by the self-contained> consciousness of the non-natural intellect. Ultimately the-self-created> perceptual universe (Subjective Universe/SU) of the magician can surpass the> stimuli and consequences of the natural, material one (Objective Universe/OU). > 4. Every number is infinite; there is no difference.> This principle was later revealed as an important key to #II-76 by the Book of> Coming Forth by Night. Crowley’s extensive essay on the subject in both 777> and his 1920 Comment is excellent and deserves a thoughtful reading. According> to Pythagoras and his Egyptian initiatory sources, numbers are the> \"building-blocks\" of existence: They are not Forms per se, but are rather the> \"alphabet\" through which many Forms are made comprehensible.4> [CR%21XKH88GDSZ52D3DFGXSBK3FPMAAQE_split_022.html#filepos906846] > If Nuit is considered to represent the expanse of the natural, material> universe (OU), then the inclusion of this statement in this first chapter> assumes additional significance. Numbers are infinite. For example, there can> be countless manifestations of things which are viewed as quarters of wholes> or as quartets of complete wholes. At the same time the \"4-principle\" is rigid> in itself and is thus a fixed component of the OU. > 5. Help me, o warrior lord of Thebes, in my unveiling before the Children of> men!> The \"warrior lord of Thebes\" is Amon (Amun/Amen) , the patron warrior-neter of> Thebes (Uast), generally portrayed as a ram or as a man wearing a twin-plumed> headdress.

Note the emphasis given> to the term \"Children\", implying an elect body of initiates rather than the> human species as a whole. > 6. Be thou Hadit, my secret centre, my heart & my tongue!> \"Hadit\" means \"inspired utterance\". \"Had\" is also the \"secret center\" of the> word Abrahadabra, described by Crowley as the Magical Formula of the Æon of> Horus. The \"abra\" prefix & suffix each translate hieroglyphically as \"heart of> Ra\" or \"purification of Ra\", which would render the entire Formula as an> \"inspired utterance from the heart of Ra\". > 7. Behold! it is revealed by Aiwass the minister of Hoor-paar-kraat.> Harpokrates is Horus the Younger, the later Osirian corruption of the Great> Horus (HarWer).

The Khabs is in the Khu, not the Khu in the Khabs.> Khabs is the hieroglyphic term for the gods of the 36 Dekans [or for stellar> gods in general]. Khu may be translated from the hieroglyphic in several ways.> Crowley preferred \"spirit\". It may also mean \"fire\" or \"flame\". Corresponding> translations would be: \"The stellar gods are conceived by one's spirit; they> do not impart it.\" -or- \"The stellar gods are within the flame; they do not> create it.\"5 [CR%21XKH88GDSZ52D3DFGXSBK3FPMAAQE_split_022.html#filepos907302] > If the \"spirit\" or \"flame\" is presumed to be the Black Flame of primal> separate intelligence identified in the Diabolicon, then the two translations> are identical.6> [CR%21XKH88GDSZ52D3DFGXSBK3FPMAAQE_split_022.html#filepos907958] The stellar> neteru [as opposed to those signified by other symbols] are identified as> aspects or Forms of the Primal Form of separate intelligence. > 9. Worship then the Khabs, and behold my light shed over you.> Attention is properly directed towards the stellar neteru and what they> symbolize. One personification of these neteru [according to the imagery of> the Age of Satan] may be found in the Diabolicon.

Come forth, o children, under the stars, & take your fill of love!> Crowley interprets this straightforwardly as a statement that sexual or> artistic love should be indulged openly and innocently, and that an empathy> with Nuit will be one of the consequences. It may also be that one’s vision,> magical abilities, and emotional sensitivity will be heightened at night, when> Solar light and radiation are at least partially shielded.8> [CR%21XKH88GDSZ52D3DFGXSBK3FPMAAQE_split_022.html#filepos909302] > 13.

But she said: the ordeals I write not: the rituals shall be half known and> half concealed: the Law is for all.> Nuit refuses to identify the suicide “ordeal” required of separate> personalities for absorption into the whole.

He must teach; but he may make severe the ordeals.> A Magus must Utter his Word; that is, he is compelled to explain his> philosophical principle.

The word of the Law is θεληµα.> [In English: Thelema.] Crowley explained this concept as “harmony of Will and> Action”, but he also wondered if it might not also have “probably a very lofty> secret interpretation”. That interpretation is decipherable once the word of> Nuit - inertia - is known. What is understood by the term “Will” is an> expression of mental separateness from Nuit, in that the self is impressing> its desire for inertial change upon Nuit. > By definition, then, the separate Will cannot be harmonious. Harmony with Nuit> can occur only when the separate Will is destroyed and the mind mechanically> fused with the inertia of the OU. This notion has been expressed as “oneness> with God”, nirvana, etc. From the standpoint of Nuit this is immortalization> of the Will; from the standpoint of the individual apart from Nuit it is> suicide. > Contained in the concept is the principle that the individual Will can be> weakened and destroyed only by the separate being possessing it. It is not “of> Nuit” and cannot be directly influenced by that neter. > Within the context of the Æon of Horus, then, Thelema could be seen as the> “sane” alternative to chaotic behavior, since the essence and presence of Set> were as yet concealed. > 40. Who calls us Thelemites will do no wrong, if he look but close into the> word. For there are therein Three Grades, the Hermit, and the Lover, and the> man of Earth. Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.> Crowley advanced a Cabalistic interpretation thus: The = the Hermit [of the> Tarot] = “invisible yet illuminating”. le = the Lover = “visible as is the> lightning-flash - the College of Adepts”. ma = “the man of Earth - the Blasted> Tower”. He went on to add the Cabalistic/numerological values of these three> cards and obtained 31 (“AL”+“LA”), whence came the secret name of the Book of> the Law. > The famous final sentence of this passage, originating [like “Thelema”] in Dr.> Francois Rabelais’ novel Gargantua, had also been used by Sir Francis Dashwood> who inscribed FAY CE QUE VOUDRAS over the main entrance to Medmenham Abbey. > Crowley, in adopting it, applied it specifically to “one’s true will” - which,> according to the Word of the Æon of Horus, meant the uniting of the individual> will with that of the OU (Nuit). > 41. The word of Sin is Restriction. O man! refuse not thy wife, if she will! O> lover, if thou wilt, depart! There is no bond that can unite the divided but> love: all else is a curse. Accursed!

Hell.> Compare the Magical Formula of the Age of Satan (1966-1975 CE): “Indulgence> instead of Abstinence.” Crowley interprets “love” in a sexual context, but the> comment concerning union of the divided implies the neutralization of> complementary opposites by fusion - the compulsion of Nuit. [See #1-29 through> #1-32.] All impulses other than those which lead towards such reunion and> neutralization are seen as a curse, and they are collectively characterized as> Hell.

Nu! the hiding of Hadit.> Within Islam, the term hadith identifies a “divinely inspired utterance”. The> term has no meaning in Egyptian hieroglyphic. The “Hadit”-figure on the Stele> of Revealing is identified in the inscription as Behdety, a form of HarWer,> the Great Horus. This Second Chapter is intelligible if it is understood as an> utterance of Aleister Crowley inspired by HarWer. [By contrast, the Third> Chapter is in the form of a direct address by this neter.] > In this first verse Nuit is said to conceal or obscure the magician’s> awareness of HarWer. If Nuit is recognized as the inertial neter of the OU,> and if HarWer - per the Book of Coming Forth by Night - is seen as a> concentration of intelligence directly opposite to Nuit, the antipodal tension> between them may be understood. > 2. Come! all ye, and learn the secret that hath not yet been revealed. I,> Hadit, am the complement of Nu, my bride. I am not extended, and Khabs is the> name of my house.> Crowley considered Hadit to be symbolic of “infinite contraction” - a> geometric point - and Nuit “infinite expansion” into the three geometric> dimensions. The concepts have no meaning save in pure mathematics, because the> former state would mean nonexistence save as a locus, and the latter a state> of existence embracing everything - in which case “Hadit” could not think or> talk, while there would be no one “else” for Nuit to talk with! > “Khabs” may be translated variously [see #I-8]. Here it characterizes HarWer> as a neter of “pure spirit” [see #II-1]. > 3. In the sphere I am everywhere, the centre, as she, the circumference, is> nowhere found.> Crowley compared this to “an old mystical definition of God - He whose centre> is everywhere and whose circumference nowhere”. In terms of Euclidian> geometry, of course, both the center and the shell of a given sphere can be> determined. Technically the shell can be “found”; it is the physical> displacement of a sphere in space.

Yet she shall be known and I never.> The OU may be comprehended through the logical and empirical procedures of> science. The pure intellect, since it possesses the capacity to behave> illogically, may not be defined through logic alone. Nœtic intuition is also> required.

Let the evil ones be cast> away; let the good ones be purged by the prophet! Then shall this Knowledge go> aright.> Crowley understood the “old time” as a reference to the Æon of Osiris,> characterized by the predominance of death-worship religions, now to be> superseded by the Æon of Horus. > He understood the ritual reference to mean that he must purge the texts of the> Golden Dawn (G.'.D.'.) to ensure their compliance with the principles of the> new æon. > 6. I am the flame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core of every> star. I am Life, and the giver of Life, yet therefore is the knowledge of me> the knowledge of death.> The phenomenon of isolate self-consciousness (the Gift of Set of the Book of> Coming Forth by Night or “Black Flame” of the Diabolicon) distinguishes man> from beast. This same capacity enables man to perceive his existence as> distinct from that of the Nuit-cosmos, hence the finity of that distinct> existence - eventual death of the self. > 7. I am the Magician and the Exorcist. I am the axle of the wheel, and the> cube in the circle. “Come unto me” is a foolish word; for it is I that go.> HarWer is the creator of a new æon and the destroyer of the old one. His being> is the origin - or axle - of the new æon, and elaborations of the Word of that> æon extend outwards from this core principle. > Cubical altars within magic circles were used for certain types of magical> ceremonies, but the relationship was expanded to three dimensions in the “Cry> of the 30th Æthyr” in Liber 418 (The Vision and The Voice): “This cube is> surrounded by a sphere” - implying the spiritual above and beyond the purely> material. > 8. Who worshipped Heru-pa-kraath have worshipped me; ill, for I am the> worshipper.> Harpokrates, the infant Horus the Younger of the Osirian mythos, is in fact a> corruption of HarWer, the Great Horus. Here HarWer exposes the corruption and> points to a further fallacy: An intellect cannot worship itself as an> “object”. > 9. Remember all ye that existence is pure joy; that all the sorrows are but as> shadows; they pass & are done; but there is that which remains.> This reaffirms the opposition of HarWer to Nuit, who considers nonexistence> [of anything else] the supreme joy [see #I-32]. Finite intellects are subject> to death. The non-conscious whole of matter/energy (Nuit) will, however,> continue to displace space indefinitely. > 10. O prophet! thou hast ill will to learn this writing.> 11. I see thee hate the hand & the pen; but I am stronger.> 12. Because of me in Thee which thou knewest not.> 13. for why? Because thou wast the knower, and me.> Crowley recounts that, at this point, he resented the direction of the Book of> the Law but was unable to cease transcribing it. At the time he was an avowed> Buddhist [which, since Buddhists seek obliteration of the self in nirvana, is> not inconsistent with his attraction to Nuit]. The Second Chapter of the Book> of the Law attacks this position with an affirmation of the independent> existence of the intellect. And even the very attempt to “deny” the intellect> affirms its existence: Cogito Ergo Sum. > 14. Now let there be a veiling of this shrine; now let the light devour men> and eat them up with blindness!> Despite the glaring truth of #II-10/13, those who “don’t want to hear it” will> simply ignore it in favor of cherished fantasies. Crowley himself missed its> significance altogether. Hence he also failed to understand that it was the> HarWer aspect of his own mind that was the actual source of this Second> Chapter. > 15. For I am perfect, being Not; and my number is nine by the fools; but with> the just I am eight, and one in eight: Which is vital, for I am none indeed.> The Empress and the King are not of me; for there is a further secret.> In the Old Comment, which appeared in the Equinox in 1912, Crowley wrote: “I> am perfect, being Not (31 LA or 61 AIN) … Which is vital, for I am None> indeed. LA.” This is rather at odds with Charles Stansfeld Jones (Frater> Achad) first revealing the AL/LA “key” to Crowley in 1919. > 9 is the number of the Tarot trump “The Hermit”, symbolizing [according to the> Book of Thoth] the Secret Fire Khu [see #I-8 and #I-13].

Thou shalt obtain the order & value of the English alphabet; thou shalt> find new symbols to attribute them unto.> A straightforward instruction for Crowley to discard the number & letter> values of the Hebrew Cabala.

He admitted his dissatisfaction with this in his 1920> Comment, theorizing further research into Sanskrit or Enochian. > The actual solution was deceptively simple: a direct, numerical equivalence to> the order of the English alphabet and the construction of a new symbol for> each letter/number. #II-55 was later to prove crucial to the revealing of> #II-76 in the Book of Coming Forth by Night. > 56. Begone! ye mockers; even though ye laugh in my honour ye shall laugh not> long: then when ye are sad know that I have forsaken you.> Those who ridicule the Book of the Law, feeling secure in the conventions and> norms of the expiring Æon of Osiris, will find that this conservatism works> against them when the inertia of Nuit gradually aligns itself to the emerging> values of the Æon of Horus. > Crowley himself was of the opinion [in the 1920 Comment] that this verse also> had a special meaning with regard to impostors and false cults abusing the> license of the Æon of Horus: that ultimately they would merely make themselves> look foolish. There is a lesson here for any individual or group attempting to> “go through the motions” of ritual magic, Thelemic or otherwise, without> actually understanding the principles or desiring the results the ceremonies> in question were originally conceived to activate. Ritual without such> understanding and purpose becomes merely a rote exercise, hence an excuse to> not think! > True to the OU-unifying principle of Nuit, Crowley went on to propose> intellectual separateness [from Nuit … ironically the central feature of> HarWer, whose æon he was inaugurating] as the ultimate “evil”.

[I am certain HarWer approved.] > 57. He that is righteous shall be righteous still; he that is filthy shall be> filthy still.> In the 1920 Comment Crowley viewed this as a corollary to #II-56, suggesting> that it is actually impossible for an object to undergo change, because it> cannot be altered in its basic chemical constitution.

"},{"pageContent":"A Great Shadow in His Soul Commentary on The Book of the Law By Don Webb INTRODUCTION > Will reigns Omnipotent; Love lieth at the Foundation PASCHAL BEVERLY RANDOLPH There are some excellent biographies of Crowley and some good scholarship byboth Thelemites and nonmagickians on Crowley’s path. One could trace countlessthreads leading to the Cairo Working. All great magick transforms the materialof history into something more alive and able to react to the human psyche. MostCrowley studies focus on his involvement in the Golden Dawn, an Englishpseudomasonic magickal group dedicated to self-perfection through thestrengthening of the mind and will through occult means. Their ceremonies havedominated Western occultism, but perhaps their greatest legacy was teaching ayoung Aleister Crowley that humans can obtain to greater Being by discrete acts,which inform the soul of its true nature. The Golden Dawn taught the mysteriesof Resurrection: a pure spiritual life after one has died to the flaws of theworld. Crowley, because of a mixture of great magickal gifts and a lot of freetime, moved through its ranks quickly. He became embroiled in the in-fightingthat all small magickal groups seem to be heir to and began looking to the widerworld for initiatory models. When he found them, he destroyed the Golden Dawn’sparadigm with a paradigm oriented on life in the world. The Golden Dawn taughthim that magick is the way, but his philosophical and religious bent came from amuch wider field. I want to trace six threads in the nineteenth century fromIreland, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, America, and Egypt that createdcertain material for the psyche of the man born Edward Alexander Crowley, whomwe know as Aleister Crowley. In 1825 a nondenominational movement in Ireland that came to be called thePlymouth Brethren came into being. The somewhat strict sect had certaininteresting properties. It was against paid clergy, preferring each head of thehousehold to be the family divine. Then, as now, it focused on the study of thebook of Revelation, and it was and is strongly patriarchal—wherein each man wasto find his family’s way to salvation and women were silent during worship (1Corinthians 14:35). The Brethren held that hard work is a sign of God’s grace.Because God has made you better, you work harder. This sect attracted thehard-working poor. This idea, normally called the Protestant work ethic, treatssalvation as having happened in the here and now, and holds that signs of thatsalvation would be seen in the material world, in contrast to the view inCatholicism that salvation was a future event. The magickal notion that one canachieve conversation with the Holy Guardian Angel and profit thereby fits betterwith Protestant views than with Catholic ones. The central rite of the Brethrenwas the Love Feast, or Aγάπη (agape, Greek for “love” and poetically for“communion”); this rite determined the fellowship in Christ, not the sacramentsof the church. Edward Crowley was born into this sect, but unlike most of itsmembers escaped to a university-level education. His mother identified him withthe Beast 666, and the harsh morality created a great shadow in his soul that hewas able to fill with forbidden vices and magick while still keeping the LoveFeast and the subjugation of women. François Rabelais was one of the first humans to shake off the chilling effectsof the medievalist paradigm. Writing under the pseudonym of Alcobrias Nasier hecreated a series of novels that poked fun at churchly institutions. He has hisgiant, Gargantua, build an abbey named after the word Will in French,Thélème—with a swimming pool, maid service, no clocks, and so forth. But inaddition to mocking the church, he was designing a utopia where human appetiteswere acknowledged and the human desire for pleasure, the quest for knowledge,and the playfulness of art were all in place. He describes his Utopian life andview of the nature of humans thus: > In all their rule and strictest tie of their order there was but this one> clause to be observed, Do What Thou Wilt; because men that are free,> well-born, well-bred, and conversant in honest companies, have naturally an> instinct and spur that prompteth them unto virtuous actions, and withdraws> them from vice, which is called honor. This model of a community elected by love—real love, as the love of theBrethren, not the sham—became an ideal view of human governance. The notion thathumans’ wants lead to sin is removed, replaced with a better idea that humanscould use their desire to create a better life. The Utopians and the Brethren,with their exclusionary views, had a new watchword. Rabelais also introducedCrowley to the notion that spelling could be used to refine a word’s meaning andsparked his love for philology. When this idea was to later mix with the GoldenDawn’s version of Kabbalah, many of Crowley’s magickal and poetic techniqueswould result. In 1816 Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote a poem about an “evil genius”—the spirit thatdivinely animates a poet. The poem, “Alastor; or, The Spirit of Solitude,” tellsof a poet who travels to the end of the Earth, including the Caucasus Mountains,Persia, Arabia, Kashmir, and so forth. The poet rejects an Arab girl as he seeksan idealized manifestation of womanhood. However, one night a veiled maidinduces a dream in which the poet sees the supernatural realm. Overcome withthis vision he pursues it by taking a boat into the occult interior of theEarth, eventually to be swallowed by the supernatural world, and leaves theworld of decay. Shelley’s poem about the endless search for “strange truths inundiscovered lands” became a model for Edward Crowley and the source of hischosen name, Aleister. Shelley had chosen the name of an “avenging spirit”—asort of fury—that revenged family bloodshed. His poem, which I have included(see poem [CR%21XKH88GDSZ52D3DFGXSBK3FPMAAQE_split_014.html#filepos475093]),marks the first use of the word weird to mean “uncanny” rather than “fate” or“destiny.” Many of Crowley’s romantic affectations, such as taking a Persianname while in Cairo, are found in Shelley’s spell. Crowley is not alone in hislove for this poem; Mary Shelley considered it her husband’s finest, and authorJ. K. Rowling borrowed the name for the greatest “auror” in her Harry Potterseries, Alastor “Mad-Eye” Moody. In 1844 Friedrich Nietzsche was born, and he brought a strong voice for Will. Headvocated the use of philology and radical perspectivism as ways of getting tothe truth. Perspectivism entails looking at a question from different viewpointsuntil the truth abolishes the viewpoints. Nietzsche identified the roles ofApollo and Dionysus in Greek culture and insisted on a strong identificationwith Dionysus. Nietzsche deplored the figure of the passive, suffering Christand evinced a strong anti-Christianity bias. He described a lifeway of willovercoming both the intellectual fetters and the material world obstacles,resulting in a state he called “ipsissimus.” (The effects of Nietzsche’steaching will be covered in the chapter titled “The Grade of Ipsissimus.”)Crowley’s philosophy, cultural attitudes, truth processes, and goals were allnicely presaged in this man. Polite English occultists read Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, impolite ones readPaschal Beverly Randolph. Randolph had a habit picked up from his mother thatruined his reputation in America; he was an African American. In fact the habitwas so pronounced that he was asked to leave the funeral train of his friendAbraham Lincoln. After all, you wouldn’t want a black man riding Lincoln’s train(with Obama thou are revenged)! Randolph developed a threefold magickal system:a training of the Will, a visualization system working on complementary colors(“flashing colors”), and a love-based sex-magick system. In addition to this hecreated mail-order initiation. Were it not for prejudice, his name wouldcertainly be better known than that of French occult author Eliphas Levi. Hisworks were read by members of the Golden Dawn, the OTO, and even Russian authorand spiritual teacher G. I. Gurdjieff. The Golden Dawn lifted a good part ofRandolph’s magickal system, and the religious nature of sex and Will made aperfect fit for Thelema. His magickal order of the Brotherhood of Eulis wasestablished in 1875, a period when Randolph knew triumph and tragedy. He died byhis own hand in July of that year. Oddly many of the ideas sold as “tantra” inthe new age, however—male retention and prolonged female orgasm—are not fromauthentic South Asian tantra, but from Randolph’s works via the OTO. In 1858 François Auguste Ferdinand Mariette found a mortuary stele for a ThebanMontu. Sadly the Egyptians had many animals for the same god. Horus can be afalcon or bull or a human priest named Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu. Most Egyptians wereburied with a heart scarab bearing spell 30 from the Book of the Dead, but thepriesthood of Montu and Amon preferred steles bearing the spell on the back anda spell that allows their ba, akh, and sheut—portions of their soul—to movefreely in the farworld and to shine like a star there. The stele is an emblem ofthe cosmos; it is enveloped by Nuit. The sun in the form of Horus Behdety shineson the central scene, where Ra-Hoor-Khuit receives an offering fromAnkh-ef-en-Khonsu. The stele is created so that parts of the dead man’s soulcomplex are able to have an active and coherent afterlife—exactly the sort ofafterlife that the Plymouth Brethren’s heaven was not. The Egyptian dead in somecults had to work at their afterlife. Let’s examine the elements. The nameAnkhef-en-Khonsu means “he who lives for Khonsu.” Khonsu, the moon god, had astrong cult in Thebes as “arranger of destinies.” The Theban notion was thathumans could achieve their destinies in harmony, a belief that remanifested asCrowley’s notion of True Will. Khonsu’s name means “traveler”; outside of Thebeshe replaced Montu as a war god, and his special power was to slay the enemies ofthe pharaoh and make a placenta out of them for the unborn pharaoh’snourishment. Like Montu and Horus, he was falcon-headed. Montu, a war god, had absorbed the Cult of Set in the Twenty-first Dynasty, whenthe growing religion of Osiris had made Set unpopular. Like Set, Montu was a godof outsiders; his name means “nomad,” and foreigners (like Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu’sfather) could enter his priesthood. He was a falcon-headed god of war but wasalso symbolized by a bull. In Egypt you could go one of three places as a deadguy. You could go to the farworld and work in the fields, you could get in Re’sboat, or in a lesser-known cult you could shine on as a star. In Egyptian termsyou became “an effective one” and an akh. (In Crowley’s time this term wastransliterated as “khu.”) When Montu first showed up in the Egyptian pantheon hewasn’t a warrior but a god of the sky and stars. Pyramid Text 503*1[CR%21XKH88GDSZ52D3DFGXSBK3FPMAAQE_split_022.html#filepos911099] says, “WhenMontu is high, I will be high with him, when Montu runs, I will run with him.”Spell 555 says, “I have gone up to the sky as Montu.” Spell 412 speaks of theastral afterlife of the king after identifying him with Sirius and Orion, bywhich the king is made badass: “May the terror of you come into being in thehearts of the gods . . . like the lock of hair, which is the head of theMontu-stars.” Nuit, whose body is full of stars, had the cult title of “she whoholds a thousand souls.” She protects and empowers the stele, making it a map ofthe cosmos. The solar god Horus Behdety is not Horus, the son of Osiris. Insteadhe is in an eternal battle with his brother Set, and he takes the form of awinged disk (as seen in this stele) to guard the barque of Re, Ra’s boat thatwill traverse the sky and the netherworld for millions of years. The offeringscene places Ra-Hoor-Khuit at the same level as Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu, meaning thelatter has been deified. Ra-Hoor-Khuit was “Horus/Re of the two horizons”; Re isshown in a form symbolizing rebirth, as he stood at both sunrise and sunset.Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu is dressed as a Sem priest, one of the priesthood of Anubis,who guided souls into other realms. The portions of his soul that are preservedare his sheut, ba, and akh. The sheut, or shadow, is the part of a human thatgives movement and sexuality; it is a servant of Anubis. The ba is that part ofthe human that we would think of as “ourselves.” It holds personal history andmust be helped to leave the body after death. The akh, the effective one, is ashining presence that is the living intellect. It was not an action of the mind;rather the mind mirrored it. After death it became a star. In the mid-nineteenth century, France and England were in an artifact race as anexpression of their colonial rivalry. Each nation rushed into looting andpublishing about what they could find. In 1852 C. W. Goodwin had translated aninvocation of the Headless One from the Greek Magickal Papyri. The work was abig hit with certain members of the Golden Dawn. Crowley’s teacher in the GoldenDawn, Alan Bennett, was fascinated with the text, but with some occult-nikslight of hand changed it into the Ritual of the Bornless One. The Headless Onehas variously been identified with Set, Osiris, or Bes. Crowley had modified theinvocation for his own purposes. On a trip to the Great Pyramid at the springequinox (March 20, 1904), he decided to show magick to his young wife. Thinkabout that. He was sure that if he did the ritual she would see something. Now agood deal of ink has been spilled about the Great Pyramid: it lies almostexactly on the thirtieth parallel, it was built by aliens, and so on. In truthit lies next to a large rock quarry. However, the spells painted on the walls ofthe pyramids suggest two things. On the one hand they were after-death spells,but a strong argument for their predeath use is put forth in Shamanic Wisdom inthe Pyramid Texts by Jeremy Nadler. Sem priests initiated the pharaoh while hewas alive so he could gain access to the ancestral wisdom embodied in Osiris andbecome the living god Horus. The place where one became Horus was the King’sChamber, and although Crowley did not know this, it was there that he invokedthe Headless God hoping to call up some sylphs. Rose did not see sylphs, but shedid tell Crowley, “They are waiting for you!” To understand the scene, recallthat Crowley was on his way back to England with a pregnant wife to settle down.Were the gods offering him the salvation of gnosis, or was his wife trying tooutdo him in a game of pretend? Crowley had been disgusted by British colonialism when he had visited Ceylon atthe beginning of his honeymoon in 1903. Visiting the French-designed,Austrian-built Boulaq museum on March 21, 1904, was a defiant act, somewhat loston us moderns. Crowley paid for a translation of the stele that Rose led him to.There was a famous error; Behdety was translated as Had. The image was clear onthe stele: Nuit on the outside, the smaller flying sphere of Had within, andAnkh-ef-en-Khonsu engaged in a magickal exchange. This magickal map fulfilledits original purpose; the effective one, “he who lives for Khonsu,” influencedthe living; and Crowley found a map for his desires and those historical,personal, and magickal threads that he was about to recast as an æon. Crowleytook on the role of the Antichrist to revive this Law. He set his actions up asthe ending and avenging alastor of the age and magickally united himself with abuilt-in enemy of the Æon of Osiris. CHAPTER 1 OF THE BOOK OF THE LAW The full title of The Book of the Law, which is Liber AL vel Legis, sub figuraCCXX, as delivered by XCIII = 418 to 666, decodes as follows. In the Bible,“Book of the Law” is a reference to the first five books, which contain thecovenant between Jehovah and the Hebrew people. These books establish an idea ofelection (the Hebrews are the chosen people), a secret cosmology (the Hebrewsalone know how the world comes into being), and a set of moral and religiouspractices whereby the health, prosperity, and military victory of the Hebrewscan be guaranteed. Because of Crowley’s scripture study with the PlymouthBrethren, The Book of the Law should be viewed similarly. The Law belongs to AL,Aleph Lamed, a unique name of God combining divine mercy and divine judgment.Hebrew letters have numerical values, and Hebrew mysticism holds that words withthe same total have the same meaning in an esoteric sense. Written as separateletters, it has a value of 31, equal to ShT, the name of Set signifying “fireand force.” Written as a ligature it has the value of 90, being equivalent toMelek or “king.” The book has 220 verses, which suggest various gematria, butgiven the title I think the equivalent would be the Hebrew phrase “he chooses,”indicating the election of its readers. The name of the dictator of the Book,Aiwass, in Hebrew may be written as OIVZ and hence 93, the number of theThelemic current. The name may also be written Aleph 1 + Yod 10 + Vav 6 + Aleph1 + Tav 400 = 418, if the final Tav is without diacritical marks (and thereforepronounced as an “S”). Ninety-three is the value of Thelema or Will and agape orlove. The action that motivates humans to know one another as a source of joyand the action to shape one’s life and world are equivalent ideas. This is theformula of Nietzsche’s Ãœbermensch; it is his duty to overcome the world andbecome an Ipsissimus, but it is the duty of all humans to aid this achievementof Will. The number 418 symbolizes the Great Work in which a human, Working hardtoward his perfection, is united in conversation with the immanent perfectedself—the Holy Guardian Angel. The interior magickal quest, the outwardexpression of the Will to power and love is a driving force, seen as the samedeed and force. Gone is the passivity of Christ or the renunciation of the yogi. The first chapter is dedicated to Nuit, the Egyptian mother goddess, whose namemeans “sky.” In Egyptian coffins, the starry body of Nuit was painted on theinside so that the dead man could copulate with her and reproduce himself as animmortal being. She corresponds to Shakti, animating the dead and passive Shiva,to Isis, making the dead Osiris impregnate her to give birth to Horus, and toLilith, who preferred the superior position in sex and thus pissed off God. Asyou age and grow, your internal universe grows; you have a place for yourfavorite toy at age four, your first sexual experience, your understanding ofevolution, the planet Saturn, what your aunt Mary smells like, the quadraticformula, and your last difficult bowel movement. Nuit is the symbol for all youhave thought and will think, feel, or remember. I read Crowley’s symbolism in adifferent way than Aquino did. (He sees Nuit as the goddess or neter of themechanical universe; I see her as the goddess of a human’s conception of theuniverse.) I think Crowley’s reading of the works of Immanuel Kant and JohannGottlieb Fichte enforced this notion. Nuit is vaster then any one picture youhave of the cosmos. You take for granted that I or the guy shopping in thecorner of the bookstore or Mahatma Gandhi all inhabit the same universe, but allyou or I (or Gandhi) can know is our subjective universe. This chapter is aboutthe world you have created to surround and protect you, with which you arecontinuously copulating to make the ever-new you. The chapter is sixty-sixverses long; six, the first perfect number, times eleven, the number of energytending toward change. As such it is a sublime explanation of the tao. In Hebrewgematria it is the value of “I will go.” Every one that deals with The Book of the Law has to decipher it as part ofgaining access to it. First this requires the chutzpa to do what Crowley tellsyou not to do. Second it requires that you can look at different approaches, notto adopt them, but to seek to broaden your mind and shatter your realitytunnels. I am sharing my deconstruction as a prelude to discussing certainaspects of Crowley’s Utterance that can empower and enlighten the Left-Hand-Pathseeker. I-1. Had! The manifestation of Nuit. I-2. The unveiling of the company of heaven. I-3. Every man and every woman is a star. I-4. Every number is infinite; there is no difference. I-5. Help me, o warrior lord of Thebes, in my unveiling before the Children ofmen! I-6. Be thou Hadit, my secret centre, my heart & my tongue! I-7. Behold! it is revealed by Aiwass the minister of Hoor-paar-kraat. I-8. The Khabs is in the Khu, not the Khu in the Khabs. I-9. Worship then the Khabs, and behold my light shed over you! I-10. Let my servants be few & secret: they shall rule the many & the known. I-11. These are fools that men adore; both their Gods & their men are fools. Hadit is the point of awareness in the subjective universe. It creates the hereand now. Its moods and thoughts are what we see as “reality.” From the point ofview of physics, the objective approach to the objective universe, “here andnow” aren’t all that special. None of the laws of the universe reflect animportance of the here and now; it is the Self, the “secret of secrets,” thatmakes the here and now—this infinitely small segment of time and space—asimportant because it is the perpetual place of choosing. “Had” is a light in thegreat dark of the Self. Crowley is to learn to perceive himself as such a star.His experience of the here and now is to reflect the divine and sexual love theSelf can have for all of its contents. The momentary distractions of good andbad are cast aside if one sees the joyous interaction of self to Self. Allhumans are, thus, stars. Crowley’s Holy Guardian Angel, whom he sometimesidentifies as Set, Satan, or Shaitan and sometimes as an Ipsissimus, who leadsthe Aimage [images/00004.jpg]Aimage [images/00004.jpg], is acting as a ministerfor the child of Nuit and Hadit, the self always being reborn of theircopulation. The first matter to be discussed is religion. Humans are not in thestars, the stars are in them; as Cassius says to Brutus, “The fault, dearBrutus, is not in our stars, But in ourselves, that we are underlings.” Humansare not fated; the stars, or khabs, are inside our effective selves (khu, orakhu). We are not to worship ourselves but the glories of the universe and other stars,since they reflect ourselves. If we possess this secret of what we are in eachmoment, we are of the Elect and serve the greater whole of our being. We are notlimited to worshipping any creation of humans—their gods—nor blinded byworshipping our future selves (living for some afterlife). Thus we rule bygnosis; we are not caught up in human constructs. I-12. Come forth, o children, under the stars, & take your fill of love! I-13. I am above you and in you. My ecstasy is in yours. My joy is to see yourjoy. I-14. Above, the gemmèd azure is The naked splendour of Nuit;She bends in ecstasy to kiss The secret ardours of Hadit.The wingèd globe, the starry blue,Are mine, O Ankh-af-na-khonsu! I-15. Now ye shall know that the chosen priest & apostle of infinite space isthe prince-priest the Beast; and in his woman called the Scarlet Woman is allpower given. They shall gather my children into their fold: they shall bring theglory of the stars into the hearts of men. I-16. For he is ever a sun, and she a moon. But to him is the winged secretflame, and to her the stooping starlight. I-17. But ye are not so chosen. I-18. Burn upon their brows, o splendrous serpent! I-19. O azure-lidded woman, bend upon them! I-20. The key of the rituals is in the secret word which I have given unto him. I-21. With the God & the Adorer I am nothing: they do not see me. They are asupon the earth; I am Heaven, and there is no other God than me, and my lordHadit. I-22. Now, therefore, I am known to ye by my name Nuit, and to him by a secretname, which I will give him when at last he knoweth me. Since I am InfiniteSpace, and the Infinite Stars thereof, do ye also thus. Bind nothing! Let therebe no difference made among you between any one thing & any other thing; forthereby there cometh hurt. If we identify our subjective universe with the great starry night, we can cometo see all things as reflecting our soul and all of our deeds as the lovemakingbetween our soul and our point consciousness. This set of verses says thatCrowley has been the priest-prince of the love of the vast soul, and as such heis as one with Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu; he will usher in a new æon. But he is not thesame as the principles that he represents; he is not the sun, nor is hisembodied shakti the same as the moon. The key to making these outward symbolswork magickally is in the Word Abrahadabra, which connects the Great Work ofconversation with the Holy Guardian Angel (418) and with the force of change inthe world—signified by the eleven letters within. The path of “know thyself!” isfound in magickal deeds. Know the desire you wish for and you know who wishesfor the desire! There are no gods, there is only the greater Self and the pointof consciousness that knows the Self. The Self may be symbolized by Nuit, but apersonal link will be created in time. Nuit identifies herself with Isis byinitial letters—“Infinite Space . . . Infinite Stars”—and warns Crowley thatthere is neither good nor bad, but thinking makes it so. Focusing and obsessingon any aspect of life distorts the ability to see and love all aspects inecstatic joy. The way of Pan and Dionysus is the preferred mode of being. I-23. But whoso availeth in this, let him be the chief of all! I-24. I am Nuit, and my word is six and fifty. I-25. Divide, add, multiply, and understand. I-26. Then saith the prophet and slave of the beauteous one: Who am I, and whatshall be the sign? So she answered him, bending down, a lambent flame of blue,all-touching, all penetrant, her lovely hands upon the black earth, & her lithebody arched for love, and her soft feet not hurting the little flowers: Thouknowest! And the sign shall be my ecstasy, the consciousness of the continuityof existence, the omnipresence of my body. I-27. Then the priest answered & said unto the Queen of Space, kissing herlovely brows, and the dew of her light bathing his whole body in asweet-smelling perfume of sweat: O Nuit, continuous one of Heaven, let it beever thus; that men speak not of Thee as One but as None; and let them speak notof thee at all, since thou art continuous! I-28. None, breathed the light, faint & faery, of the stars, and two. I-29. For I am divided for love’s sake, for the chance of union. I-30. This is the creation of the world, that the pain of division is asnothing, and the joy of dissolution all. Nuit gives a clue to her secret name. In all such moments of divine utterance,the process of finding the name reflects the understanding and experience of themagickian at the time. Games of gematria are not simple solve-them-once puzzles,but a method for the point-consciousness to reveal its place in the greaterSelf. When I suggest various values in this comment, you should know that theyreflect me; if you wish to have this text fully illuminate your place in yoursubjective universe, which is its function—to let you know the location, speed,and direction of your point-consciousness at a given moment, so that you canchange any of those aspects guided by love of the greater Self—then you mustwork out these values on your own. For “six and fifty,” I add 56, I multiply300, and I divide 6 by 50. For me at this moment, I recall that Plutarch saidthat the Pythagoreans associated Typhon with a polygon of fifty-six sides, andthe makers of Stonehenge used this polygon to mark their calendar. So I think atthis moment of illumination that to know Nuit, I must know how theinterrelationship between Nuit and Typhon, symbol of the unnatural aspect of thepsyche, relates to the circle of nature. Or in other words I can only know myclose approximation of the whole of the universe. For 300 today I think (viaHebrew gematria) of the Breath of God; Nuit, my subjective universe, is the samething as the animating force that makes me other than clay. For .012 (6 dividedby 50) I think of a sequence: the empty self (0) does not know it exists,suddenly it becomes aware of itself (1), but this leads to the observer and theobserved (2). These two in their interactions create all things—sometimesillusions and sometimes discovering truth. Then I unite these three ideas, and Ihave a momentary flash of what my greater Self might be like, and a picture ofthe ontology of all sentient beings, and, therefore, a moment of kinship withthem. This is the method; do not rely on my interpretations as anything otherthan a launching pad. If you rely on me, you are just using my map. Your map—ifyou seriously work on it—is better for you than my map. Now your question, Am I figuring this out right? Is Crowley’s question in verseI-26? Nuit’s answer is that ecstasy is the sign of truth. In other words whenyou feel the swoon of the knower and the great unknown being one, you arecorrect, and then energy of the great unknown flows into you and expands yourability to know. As you grow in essence, you will grow in perception, and as yougrow in perception, you can bring better children and future selves into being.Crowley responds of the sadness of falling away from divine oneness. It is sadthat all humans have picked one part of their subjective universe; how odd totake your soul and divine its concepts into god and devil and spoil thewholeness of your imaginal space! Nuit reassures him that the pain of separatingknower and Self is nothing compared with the creations that come of their union.Much as Plato saw the aim of life as remembering the forms, Nuit explains theaim of life is to know her again and again, and that such breaks in theknowledge are such sweet sorrow as lovers know. I-31. For these fools of men and their woes care not thou at all! They feellittle; what is, is balanced by weak joys; but ye are my chosen ones. I-32. Obey my prophet! follow out the ordeals of my knowledge! seek me only!Then the joys of my love will redeem ye from all pain. This is so: I swear it bythe vault of my body; by my sacred heart and tongue; by all I can give, by all Idesire of ye all. I-33. Then the priest fell into a deep trance or swoon, & said unto the Queen ofHeaven; Write unto us the ordeals; write unto us the rituals; write unto us thelaw! I-34. But she said: the ordeals I write not: the rituals shall be half known andhalf concealed: the Law is for all. I-35. This that thou writest is the threefold book of Law. I-36. My scribe Ankh-af-na-khonsu, the priest of the princes, shall not in oneletter change this book; but lest there be folly, he shall comment thereupon bythe wisdom of Ra-Hoor-khu-it. I-37. Also the mantras and spells; the obeah and the wanga; the work of the wandand the work of the sword; these he shall learn and teach. I-38. He must teach; but he may make severe the ordeals. I-39. The word of the Law is θέλημα. I-40. Who calls us Thelemites will do no wrong, if he look but close into theword. For there are therein Three Grades, the Hermit, and the Lover, and the manof Earth. Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. I-41. The word of Sin is Restriction. O man! refuse not thy wife, if she will! Olover, if thou wilt, depart! There is no bond that can unite the divided butlove: all else is a curse. Accurséd! Accurséd be it to the æons! Hell. I-42. Let it be that state of manyhood bound and loathing. So with thy all; thouhast no right but to do thy will. I-43. Do that, and no other shall say nay. I-44. For pure will, unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of result,is every way perfect. These verses deal with the ethical system of Thelema. The seeker does notconcern himself with the non-elect. They are like Descartes’ automatons. Crowleywrites of Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu’s illumination. The priest learns that one obtainsknowledge through ordeals. In order to be transformative, the ordeals must besecret; the furnace of life can change only if you shed the asbestos overcoat ofreceived opinion and feel the heat as it is. The seeker shall not modify theinstructions of the Holy Guardian Angel; only the sacred text of the Self can bea guide to what the vicissitudes of life shall teach you. Crowley is givenspecific instructions; not only should he go through the ordeals, he also mustteach. He must teach by setting up severe tests for others to become of theelect; likewise he must learn and teach both magick in all forms and the methodof battle. The might of Montu, warrior lord of Thebes, is seen here; this wasnot a revelation for a priestess of gentle Isis or a death-worshipping followerof Osiris. The Word of the Law is revealed, Thelema, one of the Greek words for “Will.” Notthe classical Greek word boule you find in Homer, but the New Testament wordthat Jesus used in the Lord’s Prayer. Jesus’s passive method was to call upGod’s Will and hope he does it. The Thelemite has the job of finding his or herown Will by observing what succeeds in action in the world and listening to suchinner voices as he or she may through magick. As a good Protestant, Crowleyknows that you must honor what succeeds in the world, and as a good magickian,he knows that one must value one’s own revelation over all things in Thelema.The strands meet: Nietzsche’s Will to power, Randolph’s magickal Will, Shelley’spoetic Will to mystery, the Protestant work ethic, and Rabelais’s Thélème. Crowley states the law of Rabelais’s abbey. He then explains that the notion ofsin in this system is restriction, and adds the unusual comment of the duty tosexually service one’s wife. Suddenly it is clear that Thelema does not mean“just do whatever you want.” If your partner desires love, which is homologousto the union of Hadit and Nuit, it is your duty to give love. Any action thatenacts the brief, passionate unions of Hadit and Nuit is a sacred duty. The nature of Will is laid bare in verse I-44. Will is not a motivation leadingto an action. Will is the permanent commitment to self-union. When directedtoward an object or for a future state, it diverts the movement of Hadit, thedivine path that lets one become what one is. Just as the Christian finds lifein the world distracting because it makes him or her forget God’s Will, theThelemite finds the world distracting in that it may make him or her confusegoals and attitudes with his or her Will. Thelema is a difficult path; however,just as God gives grace to the hardworking Protestant, Nuit, the subjectiveuniverse of each human, gives grace to those who remember the relation of theknower and the self. And this grace is not merely an emotional or spiritual onebut a material one as well. Crowley’s system, reflecting his roots, isnondualist; there is not a spiritual realm and a psychical realm. I-45. The Perfect and the Perfect are one Perfect and not two; nay, are none! I-46. Nothing is a secret key of this law. Sixty-one the Jews call it; I call iteight, eighty, four hundred & eighteen. I-47. But they have the half: unite by thine art so that all disappear. I-48. My prophet is a fool with his one, one, one; are not they the Ox, and noneby the Book? I-49. Abrogate are all rituals, all ordeals, all words and signs. Ra-Hoor-Khuithath taken his seat in the East at the Equinox of the Gods; and let Asar be withIsa, who also are one. But they are not of me. Let Asar be the adorant, Isa thesufferer; Hoor in his secret name and splendour is the Lord initiating. I-50. There is a word to say about the Hierophantic task. Behold! there arethree ordeals in one, and it may be given in three ways. The gross must passthrough fire; let the fine be tried in intellect, and the lofty chosen ones inthe highest. Thus ye have star & star, system & system; let not one know wellthe other! I-51. There are four gates to one palace; the floor of that palace is of silverand gold; lapis lazuli & jasper are there; and all rare scents; jasmine & rose,and the emblems of death. Let him enter in turn or at once the four gates; lethim stand on the floor of the palace. Will he not sink? Amn. Ho! warrior, if thyservant sink? But there are means and means. Be goodly therefore: dress ye allin fine apparel; eat rich foods and drink sweet wines and wines that foam! Also,take your fill and will of love as ye will, when, where, and with whom ye will!But always unto me. I-52. If this be not aright; if ye confound the space-marks, saying: They areone; or saying, They are many; if the ritual be not ever unto me: then expectthe direful judgments of Ra Hoor Khuit! I-53. This shall regenerate the world, the little world my sister, my heart & mytongue, unto whom I send this kiss. Also, o scribe and prophet, though thou beof the princes, it shall not assuage thee nor absolve thee. But ecstasy be thineand joy of earth: ever To me! To me! I-54. Change not as much as the style of a letter; for behold! thou, o prophet,shalt not behold all these mysteries hidden therein. I-55. The child of thy bowels, he shall behold them. I-56. Expect him not from the East, nor from the West; for from no expectedhouse cometh that child. Aum! All words are sacred and all prophets true; saveonly that they understand a little; solve the first half of the equation, leavethe second unattacked. But thou hast all in the clear light, and some, thoughnot all, in the dark. I-57. Invoke me under my stars! Love is the law, love under will. Nor let thefools mistake love; for there are love and love. There is the dove, and there isthe serpent. Choose ye well! He, my prophet, hath chosen, knowing the law of thefortress, and the great mystery of the House of God. All these old letters of my Book are aright; but x is not the Star. This also issecret: my prophet shall reveal it to the wise. I-58. I give unimaginable joys on earth: certainty, not faith, while in life,upon death; peace unutterable, rest, ecstasy; nor do I demand aught insacrifice. I-59. My incense is of resinous woods & gums; and there is no blood therein:because of my hair the trees of Eternity. I-60. My number is 11, as all their numbers who are of us. The Five PointedStar, with a Circle in the Middle, & the circle is Red. My colour is black tothe blind, but the blue & gold are seen of the seeing. Also I have a secretglory for them that love me. In verse I-45, Nuit restates that this is a nondualist system. In verse I-46,certain mysteries are discussed. Nuit claims that the Jews perceive thenondualist system as the equivalent of the words mine and to God. The subjectiveconstruct of God the creator is a symbol of the true nature of the universe wedwell in. Or if I think up God, I hold in my subjective universe the creator andruler. Newer understandings for this covenant are assigned the numbers 8, 80,and the aforementioned 418. In Buddhism, to which Alan Bennett had introducedCrowley, 8 is the symbol of the dharma chakra or the balanced wheel called theeightfold path. The older notion of God is replaced by a life path that relatesthe totality of all things to process. Eighty is the number in Hebrew gematriafor a foundation and the genitives of the divine man and priesthood. Theequating of lust and religion, the eightfold path, and the knowledge andconversation of the Holy Guardian Angel all reflect the central mystery of Will,the movement between the bliss of the knower and the Self being one and thereturn to change the world based on the inner vision. “God” of the Jews has beenreplaced with a process, and miracles are no longer seen as coming from withoutbut an expression of bliss within. Verse I-48 reveals part of Crowley’s task; as Ipsissimus he will write LiberAleph and connect the Work of previous Magi in a stream. This is a key thatallows other humans to draw magickal power and inspiration from history. Mywriting of this book is a similar work. Verse I-49 is a great key. The ritualsof past æons need to be set aside; they will lead to that rather exotic form ofsleep called “occultism.” The eastern chair, the seat of authority in theangular tradition called Freemasonry, belongs to the ever-arising son. The oldgods, Osiris and Isis, are dethroned. The new god is about youth and action andsovereignty. Verse I-50 tells of the threefold process that Crowley undergoes tobe the mouth of the Word. He has been purified by the Golden Dawn, he will haveto seek out the rest of his training, much of which has just occurred to him inCeylon, and last, by success he will stand out as a leader to a certain sort ofhuman. These three paths do not map on another, and this same threefold way willremain for true seekers until the coming of the Æon of Set in 1975 or in the Æonof Horus 72, nine times eight, when the time of purification will not be needed. There are four gates to initiation: the carnal, the emotional, the intellectual,and the daemonic.*2[CR%21XKH88GDSZ52D3DFGXSBK3FPMAAQE_split_022.html#filepos911350] The four partsof the human—body, mind, heart, and psyche—all have their correct paths todevelopment. What works for one may fail for another. But in this æon, one doesnot approach these gates as a beggar but as a human who enjoys the finer thingsof the world; humility is not the path of the warrior. In verse I-52, Nuit makes it clear, if you are unfaithful to your subjectiveuniverse, the person you are becoming will make you suffer. The true path honorsthe real contents of your psyche, whatever they may be, over the prescriptionsof another. The true seeker knows that all rituals work only if they arededicated to the seeker’s own psyche in its fullest. A psychological law of theæon is laid plain; if you do not devote your efforts at changing your world andSelf to your whole Self, the personality that comes into being will beself-punishing. The spiritual masochism of Christians and atheists is laid bare. In verse I-53, “To me! To me!” can be read as the Greek Word TΩ μH (to me),which means “a cutting of a plant,” and describes how Nuit—the great whole ofthe psyche—speaks to the day-to-day self. In the Zohar, which would be theKabbalistic basis of Crowley’s learning, the great evil is “cutting”—the actionof individuating the soul from its nothingness. Those who receive The Book ofthe Law are admonished to individuate as an act of love. They do not seek tobecome a cell in the body of Adam Kadmon (“original man”) but to stand as AdamBelial (“he who has no master,” or “worthless man”). If the loving relationshipis maintained between these two parts, which are only unconnected by illusion,the world and the self are constantly made anew. The religious impulse toreconnect to the source is thus fulfilled. If this relationship is lost, noamount of honor from without will bring you true joy. Verse I-53 warns Crowleythat the document is a cipher and should not be meddled with. Any trueoutpouring of the soul is thus; it guides you for years as you decipher it.Divine speech is not like human speech. Consider this: you have three weeks toprepare a speech explaining your job, then at the last minute you discover youmust give it to three-year-olds in ten minutes. Comprehension will be an issue!Rhymes and mnemonics will abound. Verse I-54 tells of the coming of Charles Stansfeld Jones, known as FraterAchad, who will discover that the key is the Word AL and determine that humanlife is not at the lowest spot in the universe but at the place that souls mustcome in order to work on themselves. Thus he will show that the serpent ascendsto Malkuth, rather than descends as in older æons, and he will utter the WordMAnifestatION in 1948 (45 AH). Jones sought to bring about a new æon, Crowleyhad suggested that the æon following that of Horus would be ruled by Ma-at, soJones’s system set the Egptian goddess of justice at the center with his oddspelling. He thought the goal was not the divine nothingness of the top of theTree of Life, Kether, but action in the material sphere of Malkuth—or in lessethereal terms—Action versus musing. Crowley was unable to consider the new Wordor its implication since he had identified Nuit, the subjective universe, withthe idea of the objective cosmos, a holdover from older æons that makes Will anillusion, and thus Crowley made the mistake of Schopenhauer in thinking that weare sadly “condemned” to free will rather than adopting the heroism of hisbeloved Nietzsche. The message of the Holy Guardian Angel is not about a fixedfuture but of the world that should be. Verse I-57, which misled Crowley, invokes Nuit under the stars, not because sheis the physical stars, but because the night sky has always been the biggestsymbol of the deep mystery of one’s totality. The religions of the dark worldalways celebrate Self, love, and joy. Tzaddi, the fishhook that the Magus Jesus,with his Word of Agape (which by Greek numerology adds up to 93 as well), usedto capture men, is not the star or khab. In the tarot the fishhook had been thestar card, showing that the entangling of the self in the magickal school shouldhappen later in the process. The worldly man of authority, the emperor, shouldhook the initiate early in his life. (In this regard Gurdjieff was a betteremperor than Crowley.) This became Crowley’s method and reflects the æon of theever-arriving son. Verses I-57 and I-58 reveal that knowledge of the psyche must be sought; thelove of Nuit is not based on faith but on the feeling of joy. Humans findthemselves in the flow and with happiness. This is not celebrated with the bloodof sacrifice but by things that remind us of all life. The symbol of the psyche is the five-pointed star that in Egypt stood for the kain the duat.*3 [CR%21XKH88GDSZ52D3DFGXSBK3FPMAAQE_split_022.html#filepos911615]It is red like the god Set and the goddess Sekhmet. Its five points are the fivesenses through which the psyche knows the joy of incarnation. The psyche’snumber is 11, which indicates change—away from the stability of the Pythagorean10. It represents the psyche in manifestation through the five senses (touch,taste, smell, hearing, and sight) and the five actions (speaking, grasping,walking, excreting, and sex) and the mind, which reflects the psyche. Thus allthings of this world are sacraments, all senses gateways, and all actions waysfor the psyche to remember and love itself. The manifestation of one’s life isthe kysthos (Greek for “vagina”) of the psyche, and thus her letter is “K.” Kfor kysthos—it’s a sexual pun—if you put the magic in the pussy you get magick:a practice Crowley began as a Victorian schoolboy. Dirty jokes are a beginningstep in freeing one’s mind. I-61. But to love me is better than all things: if under the night-stars in thedesert thou presently burnest mine incense before me, invoking me with a pureheart, and the Serpent flame therein, thou shalt come a little to lie in mybosom. For one kiss wilt thou then be willing to give all; but whoso gives oneparticle of dust shall lose all in that hour. Ye shall gather goods and store ofwomen and spices; ye shall wear rich jewels; ye shall exceed the nations of theearth in splendour & pride; but always in the love of me, and so shall ye cometo my joy. I charge you earnestly to come before me in a single robe, andcovered with a rich headdress. I love you! I yearn to you! Pale or purple,veiled or voluptuous, I who am all pleasure and purple, and drunkenness of theinnermost sense, desire you. Put on the wings, and arouse the coiled splendourwithin you: come unto me! I-62. At all my meetings with you shall the priestess say—and her eyes shallburn with desire as she stands bare and rejoicing in my secret temple—To me! Tome! calling forth the flame of the hearts of all in her love-chant. I-63. Sing the rapturous love-song unto me! Burn to me perfumes! Wear to mejewels! Drink to me, for I love you! I love you! I-64. I am the blue-lidded daughter of Sunset; I am the naked brilliance of thevoluptuous night-sky. I-65. To me! To me! I-66. The Manifestation of Nuit is at an end. Verse I-61 says that any who dare to love their psyche in its strange andbeautiful fullness shall know joy in all things. The serpent will ascend fromthe lower chakras and unite with the mind, and both spiritual bliss and temporalwealth shall be yours. As the soul ascended into Malkuth, into MAnifestatION, soshall you anytime you make the soul aware of the fullness of its temporalmanifestation. In the original basis for Kabbalah or Merkavah mysticism, theterm for approaching Kether was yeridah, or “descent,” and returning to thisworld and Malkuth was aliyah, or “ascent.” If the cutting, the tome, that seemsto be our day-today selves swoons with bliss into the greater Self, all woundsare healed, the perplexing questions such as, Why am I having to learn thistough life lesson? are answered, and the many faces of the moods of our livesfrom brightest day to darkest night are shown as part of a great all in rapturein its play with the world. Through sensuality, art, poetry, beautiful things,and good sex can the true nature of the psyche be known. Look not to sufferinghumility or repetitions; if this could be grasped by mankind wars would vanish,the ills of religion would disappear, and a great happiness would be ours. Atsuch moments a secret joy is known for the ever-arriving son; the greatmagickian who makes your world is born of the sexual surrender of the day-to-dayself to the greater Self. When this feat is accomplished, those who have done sobecome warriors because they feel a love for all other sentient beings and adesire to show them the way. Often this may look very silly, like a youngpothead trying to get all his friends stoned, but it can also be the mostsublime moment of an artist creating her great work to enlighten all humanhearts. CHAPTER 2 OF THE BOOK OF THE LAW This chapter is dedicated to the principle of point-consciousness, Hadit.Because of the museum translator’s error, Horus Behdety, a winged solar sphere,was listed as Hadit. Crowley made use of the best scholarly material he hadaccess to, and we should do likewise. Seeking after the mysteries means asynthesis of hard-headed objective research and subjective aesthetics. This formof Horus is particularly the protective form that goes before ships, hence theEgyptian custom of painting eyes on prows. Humans have two aspects. One partseems to be beyond time and change, at harmony with a greater purpose. The otherpart is stuck in the world of becoming and change. The most direct andaccessible link between these two parts is your day-to-day, ego-driven stream ofconsciousness. Nothing could be more fickle. One thousand thousand thoughts runthrough your head pell-mell. Surely there is nothing of constancy here. Yet aconstant principle is revealed—that of dynamism. The real, more perfect, morepermanent self and the flittering phantoms of your brain are two edges of theprinciple of dynamism. Consider this analogy: if a hollow sphere were to passthough a plane, an inhabitant of that plane would see it as a point thatexpanded into a circle that grew larger and larger and then grew smaller andsmaller until it was a point again, which would then vanish. The creature in twodimensions might with supreme mental agility deduce a third dimension. Thepoints of the sphere are united in a manner that our flatlander can onlyhypothesize about. The dynamism of the psyche and the random nature of one’s thoughts are likewisepoints of a greater reality that we can only dimly know. When that ecstasy ofknowing comes, “we,” the points of awareness, are Hadit, and we know that thefield in which the thoughts of the brain and the fire of the soul wander is ourgreater Self, Nuit. This knowledge produces the third entity, the master whomakes the grass green, whom we will deal with in examining the third chapter ofThe Book of the Law. Experiences of seeing our true nature both re-create us andare magick itself. Hadit, the part of our Self that most of the time we think of as ourselves, isthe way the universe, which is the Self, knows itself. It is revealed by ournotions of the classical and magickal planets. It is changeable and cyclic likethe moon; our minds wander yet orbit certain values. If we choose badvalues—trauma or superstition—we are bound to keep circling them, thinking abouthalf the time we are getting better. Our minds are like Mercury: capable ofmagick, we can introduce changes in the world beyond mere probability and add tothe list of computations reality has to run. Our minds are like Venus: we seeklove so that we may better ourselves for the beloved. We project the best partsof ourselves outward so that we have goals to induce change. If the day-to-daypart of ourselves changes, we know better parts of our greater Selves. Our mindsare like the sun: we illuminate what we attract to ourselves. People and otherevents are drawn to us for the gift of meaning we give them; we likewise aredrawn to other stars or khabs for this. Our minds are like Mars: we make war onwhat we least like about ourselves by projecting these qualities on others.Horus Behdety was associated with Mars as well as the sun. Our minds areparticularly like Jupiter and Saturn. Jupiter achieves self-knowledge bybecoming king of the gods. That is to say he overcomes his world and thenpopulates it with god-like beings, not slaves and yes-men. Saturn stops what isnot of him and progresses by the only moral formula of sacrifice: sacrificinghis “lower” (less perfect, less permanent) self to his “higher” (more permanent,more perfect) self. There is true loss in this sacrifice: the loss ofcomfortable delusions and the loss of “friends” who are psychic vampires. Thelearned Benjamin Rowe, a scholar of Thelema whose work exists on the excellentHermetic Library site (see Resources and Suggested Reading) points out: > Jupiter = Kaph = 20 > Saturn = Tau = 400 > 400 + 20 = 420 = HADITh The odd letter convention is used by a magickian when translating Hebrew T forTau, Th for Teth. It’s an awkward device of the nineteenth century. The Hebrewletters associated in Kabbalah with these two planets show a blending of therulership of Jupiter with the severity of Saturn. The path of Hadit as Jupiter the wise ruler and Saturn the judge is a Masonicideal—leadership as initiation of the soul. This chapter explores these motifs;a human unwilling to become a good ruler and judge cannot take up the Æon ofHorus or the Æon of Set. Likewise she must excel at picking her lifepatterns—her guide is the moon, which suggests questions for her: What do Iremanifest? What do I demanifest? Learning magick (Mercury) gives meaning andlight to all she draws to her Self (the sun), loving deeply enough to want tobetter herself (Venus), and making war on those things the world has placed inher programming that she hates (Mars). This chapter speaks on how to guide theemotional and daemonic centers of the seeker to gain these qualities, and bygaining them discovering them in the greater Self. The chapter is seventy-nineverses long, signifying the atomic number of gold, the goal of the Great Work.It has the same number as the Hebrew noun for “firmness,” signifying theunbending Will. II-1. Nu! the hiding of Hadit. II-2. Come! all ye, and learn the secret that hath not yet been revealed. I,Hadit, am the complement of Nu, my bride. I am not extended, and Khabs is thename of my House. II-3. In the sphere I am everywhere the centre, as she, the circumference, isnowhere found. II-4. Yet she shall be known & I never. II-5. Behold! the rituals of the old time are black. Let the evil ones be castaway; let the good ones be purged by the prophet! Then shall this Knowledge goaright. II-6. I am the flame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core of everystar. I am Life, and the giver of Life, yet therefore is the knowledge of me theknowledge of death. II-7. I am the Magician and the Exorcist. I am the axle of the wheel, and thecube in the circle. “Come unto me” is a foolish word: for it is I that go. II-8. Who worshipped Heru-pa-kraath have worshipped me; ill, for I am theworshipper. II-9. Remember all ye that existence is pure joy; that all the sorrows are butas shadows; they pass & are done; but there is that which remains. II-10. O prophet! thou hast ill will to learn this writing. II-11. I see thee hate the hand & the pen; but I am stronger. The greater Self hides point consciousness. Point consciousness is that part ofourselves or others that we can observe; it is a star or khab. As the knower ofthe Self it is always in the center as it moves in its infinity. Ever-changing,this flame is unknowable; like a quantum particle, the observing of it changeseither its speed or location. It is the “assembly point” in the novels of CarlosCastaneda. When Rose instructed Crowley to seek after this communication, shetold him to break all the rules; the rituals of the past no longer work when thenature of magick as a truth process is known. The word Knowledge has a capital“K,” linking it with magick—the linking of 5, the number of Self, and 6, thenumber of the perceptual universe. Five stands for the Self, its symbol is thepentagram; six stands for the perceptual universe, its symbol is the hexagram.Together they add up to 11, the number of the Will, illustrating the process ofhow desire in the subjective universe becomes a law in the objective universe orin an 11-word sound byte: Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. Haditexplains its flamelike nature and the knowledge it gives all creatures: thatthey will die, time is precious, and meaning is enmeshed in time. Hadit bothcauses the Will of the magickian to manifest in the objective and subjectiverealities and has the power to remove any piece of bad programming or magick ofanother from one’s life. Verse II-8 talks of Horus the Child. The article pa signifies almost exactly thesame meaning as the English word the. There are various Egyptian words forchild: kra, mes, inp, and so on. Kra has roots in the idea of parting orleaving. In Ghana the kra is the ancestral spirit that left the planetary godsto be born on Earth. The ever-arising son is not the same thing as Hadit; it isHadit’s desire and lust to the known Nuit that creates that child. Hadit, theday-to-day self, is not an object of worship—a notion lost on those who feelthat “Do what thou wilt” means “Do what you want.” Existence is joy for Nuit andHadit; don’t be misled by the vicissitudes of life. Verses II-10 and II-11 reflect the difference between Aiwass’s purpose and thehuman-level goals of Crowley. Divine communication is harsh because it is dense,and it takes years to decipher. II-12. Because of me in Thee which thou knewest not. II-13. for why? Because thou wast the knower, and me. II-14. Now let there be a veiling of this shrine: now let the light devour menand eat them up with blindness! II-15. For I am perfect, being Not; and my number is nine by the fools; but withthe just I am eight, and one in eight: Which is vital, for I am none indeed. TheEmpress and the King are not of me; for there is a further secret. II-16. I am the Empress & the Hierophant. Thus eleven, as my bride is eleven. II-17. Hear me, ye people of sighing! The sorrows of pain and regretAre left to the dead and the dying, The folk that not know me as yet. II-18. These are dead, these fellows; they feel not. We are not for the poor andsad: the lords of the earth are our kinsfolk. II-19. Is a God to live in a dog? No! but the highest are of us. They shallrejoice, our chosen: who sorroweth is not of us. II-20. Beauty and strength, leaping laughter and delicious languor, force andfire, are of us. II-21. We have nothing with the outcast and the unfit: let them die in theirmisery. For they feel not. Compassion is the vice of kings: stamp down thewretched & the weak: this is the law of the strong: this is our law and the joyof the world. Think not, o king, upon that lie: That Thou Must Die: verily thoushalt not die, but live. Now let it be understood: If the body of the Kingdissolve, he shall remain in pure ecstasy for ever. Nuit! Hadit! Ra-Hoor-Khuit!The Sun, Strength & Sight, Light; these are for the servants of the Star & theSnake. II-22. I am the Snake that giveth Knowledge & Delight and bright glory, and stirthe hearts of men with drunkenness. To worship me take wine and strange drugswhereof I will tell my prophet, & be drunk thereof! They shall not harm ye atall. It is a lie, this folly against self. The exposure of innocence is a lie.Be strong, o man! lust, enjoy all things of sense and rapture: fear not that anyGod shall deny thee for this. When one becomes aware of the day-to-day self, one rises into a higher level andwatches thoughts, words, and deeds unfold. We mistake Hadit for ourselves whenwe discover that the self-aware part of ourselves is wandering in a greaterSelf; humans become something more than what they seem. Most humans can’t handlethis and put off all awareness into the lies of religions. In verse II-15 Haditshows that to the outer world he has nine parts, but from within he has buteight, for he sees not himself. To the world he seems ba, ka, sheut, akh, ren(the name your mom gave you), ib (heart-mind), sekhem (divine power inherent ineach thinking being), khat (the body), kheru (voice), and the Self that arisesfrom these nine. This is the mystery of the tetractys. From within he is hiddenamong the becoming spirit, the immortal spirit, the shadow, the effective one,the name, the heartmind, the power, the body, and the voice. He is nowhere,because he is known only by the manifestations that hide him. In verse II-16, Hadit is himself a male-female pair, for the universe is fractalin its dualities. He is the empress and the hierophant. The third and fifthtrumps equal 8. These eight (more-or-less) static patterns are coupled withthree dynamic patterns, making Hadit’s number the same as Nuit’s. Together theyare 22. In verses II-17 and II-18, the “poor” of humanity are despised—thosethat are poor in passion, those that long for death. These are the enemy, andHadit is Mars-like in his war against these folk in order to slay such feelingsthat have been placed into him by the forces of socialization. The grave illnessof mankind that keeps lives from being destroyed is the enemy. Much of thischapter deals with vanquishing this foe. Buddha spoke against desire, saying that it leads to suffering. Hadit speaks ofthe glory of desire. Those who accept desire are elected by Hadit to fightagainst the ideas that tell humans to settle for less, to dream small dreams,and to avoid that which if pursued might lead to disappointment. The “wretched &the weak” are not sick or financially impoverished; they are those people wholack the strength to dream. They are that class of person who does not glory inthe achievements of one’s fellow humans but seeks to make everyone feel worse;you have known these people in your life. You shared a glory with them, and theymade you feel less the moment you spoke. It matters not if it was a smallvictory (in the scheme of the world) such as getting a driver’s license or agreat victory like advancing science. The god of Crowley’s mother that deniedthe importance of human achievement is the enemy; such feelings keep Hadit fromtraveling far in the starry body of his bride. II-23. I am alone: there is no God where I am. II-24. Behold! these be grave mysteries; for there are also of my friends who behermits. Now think not to find them in the forest or on the mountain; but inbeds of purple, caressed by magnificent beasts of women with large limbs, andfire and light in their eyes, and masses of flaming hair about them; there shallye find them. Ye shall see them at rule, at victorious armies, at all the joy;and there shall be in them a joy a million times greater than this. Beware lestany force another, King against King! Love one another with burning hearts; onthe low men trample in the fierce lust of your pride, in the day of your wrath. II-25. Ye are against the people, O my chosen! II-26. I am the secret Serpent coiled about to spring: in my coiling there isjoy. If I lift up my head, I and my Nuit are one. If I droop down mine head, andshoot forth venom, then is rapture of the earth, and I and the earth are one. II-27. There is great danger in me; for who doth not understand these runesshall make a great miss. He shall fall down into the pit called Because, andthere he shall perish with the dogs of Reason. II-28. Now a curse upon Because and his kin! II-29. May Because be accursèd for ever! II-30. If Will stops and cries Why, invoking Because, then Will stops & doesnought. II-31. If Power asks why, then is Power weakness. II-32. Also reason is a lie; for there is a factor infinite & unknown; & alltheir words are skew-wise. II-33. Enough of Because! Be he damned for a dog! In verse II-23 we learn that Hadit is not a god; human endeavor is moreimportant than gods. Hadit shows us what sort of activities in the outer worldare homologous to his nature. Rulership, war, and love are sacred because theyreflect his nature. But these games are constrained; one must war against thepoor in spirit, not another lord of the Earth. The Thelemite does not warindiscriminately, nor love. Verse II-25 shows that the Thelemite, just like theexclusionist Plymouth Brethren, is apart from and opposed to the world. In verse II-26, all deeds of love lead either to greater knowledge of the soulor to magickal Will forces in the objective universe. Verses II-27 though II-33are a strong argument against the way of the world. The way of the world mighttell a painter to give up his craft to learn a practical trade. The way of theworld might tell the young traveler not to attempt her journey, but to finishschool first. The way of the world might tell you it is wiser to keep youroffice job and send a donation to a wildlife fund than to quit your job and gowork on a ship that rams Japanese whalers. The way of the world is wrong! YourWill is right! One does not pursue his Will on the weekends. It is worth notingthat the Law of Magus Stephen Edred Flowers is reyn til runa! In old Norse, thismeans “Seek the Mysteries!” or “Seek the Runes!” When written in runes, thetally of this Law adds up to 93. One might likewise note that the magickal sigilof reyn til runa! has the numeric value of 11. Thus knowing this chapter throughthe 11 runes in the phrase reyn til runa! leads us to 93 by the numerical valueof the runes. II-34. But ye, o my people, rise up & awake! II-35. Let the rituals be rightly performed with joy & beauty! II-36. There are rituals of the elements and feasts of the times. II-37. A feast for the first night of the Prophet and his Bride! II-38. A feast for the three days of the writing of the Book of the Law. II-39. A feast for Tahuti and the child of the Prophet—secret, O Prophet! II-40. A feast for the Supreme Ritual, and a feast for the Equinox of the Gods. II-41. A feast for fire and a feast for water; a feast for life and a greaterfeast for death! II-42. A feast every day in your hearts in the joy of my rapture! II-43. A feast every night unto Nu, and the pleasure of uttermost delight! II-44. Aye! feast! rejoice! there is no dread hereafter. There is thedissolution, and eternal ecstasy in the kisses of Nu. II-45. There is death for the dogs. Verses II-34 to II-45 tell of the feasts that are the way to both joy in thislife and to immortality. It is important to remember that agape means not only“love” but also “love feast,” and that numerical value of agape equals that ofThelema. Hers are the feasts in which elements and times are celebrated and theknowable parts of the objective universe are made sacred by joy. The quest forthe beloved is sacred because the relationship of prophet and bride ishomologous to that of Nuit and Hadit. This book shall be celebrated in somefashion that allows the group to think on its threefoldness. Thoth, who unitesSet and Horus after their battle, is to be celebrated, and the son of Thoth, whoexplains how Set and Horus are united to the elect, is to be celebrated. Modestyallows me only to mention at this point that my birthday is April 30, the day ofWalpurgisnacht, which is an important date in sinister traditions. Life iscelebrated, and death that gives meaning to the acts of life is to becelebrated. A celebration should be had for the moment that Hadit the Knower isdissolved in the object of his knowledge—Nuit. The day-to-day self dissolvesinto the greater Self, if and only if the life of action and joy is pursued. But for those who follow the way of the psychic vampire, for the naysayer andthe death worshipper, there is a true death. The greater Self expires for lackof love, and the knower cannot be absorbed for lack of being flavored by wonder.In short, certain people do not achieve souls. II-46. Dost thou fail? Art thou sorry? Is fear in thine heart? II-47. Where I am these are not. II-48. Pity not the fallen! I never knew them. I am not for them. I console not:I hate the consoled & the consoler. II-49. I am unique & conqueror. I am not of the slaves that perish. Be theydamned & dead! Amen. (This is of the 4: there is a fifth who is invisible, &therein am I as a babe in an egg.) II-50. Blue am I and gold in the light of my bride: but the red gleam is in myeyes; & my spangles are purple & green. II-51. Purple beyond purple: it is the light higher than eyesight. II-52. There is a veil: that veil is black. It is the veil of the modest woman;it is the veil of sorrow, & the pall of death: this is none of me. Tear downthat lying spectre of the centuries: veil not your vices in virtuous words:these vices are my service; ye do well, & I will reward you here and hereafter. II-53. Fear not, o prophet, when these words are said, thou shalt not be sorry.Thou art emphatically my chosen; and blessed are the eyes that thou shalt lookupon with gladness. But I will hide thee in a mask of sorrow: they that see theeshall fear thou art fallen: but I lift thee up. II-54. Nor shall they who cry aloud their folly that thou meanest nought avail;thou shall reveal it: thou availest: they are the slaves of because: They arenot of me. The stops as thou wilt; the letters? change them not in style orvalue! II-55. Thou shalt obtain the order & value of the English Alphabet; thou shaltfind new symbols to attribute them unto. Verses II-46 to II-48 continue to inform the heart of the Thelemite. He or sheis not to mourn the death of the killjoy, the buzz killer, the “reasonablevoice” that keeps great projects from getting off the ground; those that didnothing in this life, expecting rewards in the next, leave no trace in theuniverse. In verse II-49 Hadit explains that he is both unique and theconqueror. In any cause that began as unpopular or impracticable but came to bea dominant paradigm the nature of Hadit can be seen. It need not be a thing ofreligion or philosophy or magick. Hadit is easy to see in the quest of an honestseeker, the play of an adept, the alchemy a true priest works on these classes,the solidity of being of a Master of the Temple. But he is also in the Magus, ina hidden way; Hadit is on the side of all incoming paradigms, all things ofgrowth. Hadit is golden in that he is like the sun, blue in that he is of the body ofNuit, purple in that he is a ruler, and green in that he restores life. Hisvision is beyond that of a ruler; it is that of a sage who sees what must be.Hadit is in the actions of futurists and visionaries of all fields. He warnsthere is a veil that keeps humans from seeing what the world might be. It is theveil of the conventional, the social order, the mores that keep us peacefulprimates. Hadit is not interested in people who sell the future by hiding theirlusts, nor in hiding its perils. As Nietzsche said, “I love those who know nothow to live except as down-goers, for they are over-goers.” This indicates thatThelemites are to go against the grain of conventional morality to learn thestrength of Will to change the world into a better place. In verse II-53, the issues of Crowley’s life are spoken of. He had left hishoneymoon to bring his pregnant wife home. He had stopped his serious Work withmagick three years earlier. Now Hadit is urging him to take up an antinomianlife. But a promise is made; Crowley will not be destroyed by this path, butlifted up. And behold, you are holding his words in your hands, reading thisnow. You are the promise of Hadit. In verse II-54, Crowley receives the mostimportant revelation; he need not fear those that will argue against him becausethey are the soulless ones. They will not prevail. This is the hardest messagefor anyone taking up the initiatory life—knowing that he or she will prevaildespite the vast number of humans who hold opposing beliefs. This also revealsan important magickal principle: if you are on the side of growth, change, andevolution your magickal Will is thousands, maybe millions, of times strongerthan the Will of those who stand up for common sense and the conventional. Inverse II-55, Hadit explains that Crowley must discover or invent a new magickalsystem; those who take up his system for the love of magick will be transformedinto the philosopher warriors who must by their needs align themselves withThelema. II-56. Begone! ye mockers; even though ye laugh in my honour ye shall laugh notlong: then when ye are sad know that I have forsaken you. II-57. He that is righteous shall be righteous still; he that is filthy shall befilthy still. II-58. Yea! deem not of change: ye shall be as ye are, & not other. Thereforethe kings of the earth shall be Kings for ever: the slaves shall serve. There isnone that shall be cast down or lifted up: all is ever as it was. Yet there aremasked ones my servants: it may be that yonder beggar is a King. A King maychoose his garment as he will: there is no certain test: but a beggar cannothide his poverty. II-59. Beware therefore! Love all, lest perchance is a King concealed! Say youso? Fool! If he be a King, thou canst not hurt him. II-60. Therefore strike hard & low, and to hell with them, master! II-61. There is a light before thine eyes, o prophet, a light undesired, mostdesirable. II-62. I am uplifted in thine heart; and the kisses of the stars rain hard uponthy body. II-63. Thou art exhaust in the voluptuous fullness of the inspiration; theexpiration is sweeter than death, more rapid and laughterful than a caress ofHell’s own worm. II-64. Oh! thou art overcome: we are upon thee; our delight is all over thee:hail! hail: prophet of Nu! prophet of Had! prophet of Ra-Hoor-Khu! Now rejoice!now come in our splendour & rapture! Come in our passionate peace, & write sweetwords for the Kings. II-65. I am the Master: thou art the Holy Chosen One. II-66. Write, & find ecstasy in writing! Work, & be our bed in working! Thrillwith the joy of life & death! Ah! thy death shall be lovely: whoso seeth itshall be glad. Thy death shall be the seal of the promise of our age long love.Come! lift up thine heart & rejoice! We are one; we are none. Verses II-56 to II-59 warn about appearances. The kings may be of any rank oflife and dress as they wilt; the Law, which will transform them into kings, isto be made available to them. Likewise people who are without souls cannot hidebehind wealth or learning or good looks. They will reveal themselves as beggars,for they will beg for your enthusiasm. Yet Crowley needn’t spend his time toreach all hidden kings, for they will find him. A missionary approach is notcalled for. When dealing with the enemies of joy, one is to strike hard and low. All whofight for joy (though they look as different as Harvey Milk and Stephen Hawking)have a strong dose of ruthlessness. It matters little, for the access to joythey bring heals all who seek of them and exalt their names with imperishablefame. Verses II-61 to II-63 promise that Crowley shall find his way, fightinguntil he overcomes, and he will rise and overcome all. His election and task aremade clear in verses II-64 to II-66. There is a paradox in serving the Lord ofFreedom, whose name is Fire, Shin and Force, and Teth. Your actions that expressyour freedom and creativity make the spells, the books, the plays, and the poemsthat will lead others to express even greater freedom and creativity. Thus theveil is further torn. Great tears were made in 1948 (Achad), 1966 (April 30th ofthat year Anton LaVey founded the Church of Satan), and 1975 (the Founding ofthe Temple of Set). Great is the might of ShT, and greater still he through us! II-67. Hold! Hold! Bear up in thy rapture; fall not in swoon of the excellentkisses! II-68. Harder! Hold up thyself! Lift thine head! breathe not so deep—die! II-69. Ah! Ah! What do I feel? Is the word exhausted? II-70. There is help & hope in other spells. Wisdom says: be strong! Then canstthou bear more joy. Be not animal; refine thy rapture! If thou drink, drink bythe eight and ninety rules of art: if thou love, exceed by delicacy; and if thoudo aught joyous, let there be subtlety therein! II-71. But exceed! exceed! II-72. Strive ever to more! and if thou art truly mine—and doubt it not, an ifthou art ever joyous!—death is the crown of all. II-73. Ah! Ah! Death! Death! thou shalt long for death. Death is forbidden, oman, unto thee. II-74. The length of thy longing shall be the strength of its glory. He thatlives long & desires death much is ever the King among the Kings. The hard path of the tantrika, the Left-Hand-Path sex magickian—who must combineexcess and austerity, think pure thoughts at the orgy, and bring horror anddisgust to the sleeping pious—is laid out for Crowley. Bliss requires work andplanning; it’s not simple animal pleasure. The relationship between the inactiveShiva and the wild Shakti is stepped up in Crowley’s formula, where bothpartners must exhaust themselves, both in human form without and in magickalform within. Long desire is what changes worlds. Although a great deal of sexmagick is indicated, all forms of rapture from art, philosophy, drugs, music,yogic trance, and other aspects are needed. The knower and the greater Selfshall merge many times, ever recreating the ever-arriving son. As anyone who hasused the magicks of ecstasy knows, great highs mean devastating lows. Crowley isbeing told that he will have times of longing for death but that he may nothasten it. His life shall be above heaven and below hell. The radicalperspectivism of Nietzsche, the path of Dionysus that he recommended, has beentaken to a divine and demonic level. This life path will discredit Crowley withthe naysayers, the gray ones, the keepers of social opinion. What may havesounded fairly cool to the twenty-eight-year-old man hearing this in Cairo wouldsound different in passing decades. II-75. Aye! listen to the numbers & the words: II-76. 4 6 3 8 A B K 2 4 A L G M O R 3 Y X 24 89 R P S T O V A L. What meaneththis, o prophet? Thou knowest not; nor shalt thou know ever. There cometh one tofollow thee: he shall expound it. But remember, o chosen one, to be me; tofollow the love of Nu in the star-lit heaven; to look forth upon men, to tellthem this glad word. II-77. O be thou proud and mighty among men! II-78. Lift up thyself! for there is none like unto thee among men or amongGods! Lift up thyself, o my prophet, thy stature shall surpass the stars. Theyshall worship thy name, foursquare, mystic, wonderful, the number of the man;and the name of thy house 418. II-79. The end of the hiding of Hadit; and blessing & worship to the prophet ofthe lovely Star! The First Beast knew not what was hidden therein. The unbreakable cipherremained a spur to Crowley; without certain mysteries, one cannot remain open toNuit. It is the two faces of Runa, the Mysteries spoken of in the Law of MagusStephen Edred Flowers. One is hidden deep within the subjective universe and oneis hidden deep in the objective universe, which cause Hadit, the Knower, to findever new mysteries in the greater Self, or Nuit. Thus Hadit ensures Crowley’slifelong evolution as well as causing those who picked up his work to bring oneof its results into being in a strange way. In verses II-77 and II-78, Crowley is told the mood that will guide his deeds.Pride is a great motivator until something else—the love of Nuit—takes itsplace. It will force him into the public eye often and thus attract others tothe Work. He is told to worship his number of 666, that is to say to fulfill thesecret soul name given to him by his mother. In true Egyptian fashion she gavehim his ren, the soul name that summons events and energy when it is thought of.Her hatred of the stifling religion that she had converted to caused her tobecame angry toward her son, stopping the flow of maternal love to Crowley. Hertaunting name for him became the source of Nuit’s milk. But 666, the Antichristboth for Crowley’s mother and Nietzsche, is (in the manner of opposites that alladepts must learn) also the number of a savior. It is the numeric value of theHebrew verse, “Ata yigdal na koach Ado-nai” (“Now, I pray, let the Power of myLord be great”; Numbers 14:17). This was Moshe’s prayer invoking divine mercy onbehalf of the Jewish people. It was the spell by which the Magus Moshe (whommost of you know better as Moses) uttered the Word IVHV—the divine name thatforms the basis of the Jewish religion. Moses’ prayer called for the coming ofthe messiah. It is the six directions (north, west, south, east, up, down) orthe six days of the creation of the world repeated three times. It is thus thestrength and perfection of the physical world that will come in the messianicera, when the objective universe will reach its ultimate purpose—to be a vehiclethrough which the created experience the creator. Hadit is no longer hidden, though by the deeds suggested here, through thishero’s path, the ultimate subject will become objectified. What is withinbecomes a legacy in the world without. CHAPTER 3 OF THE BOOK OF THE LAW This chapter is about the child of Nuit and Hadit, the ever-arriving son,Ra-Hoor-Khuit. Crowley, an adept of the Golden Dawn, used the Golden Dawnnomenclature for this god. Any mystic has to use the langauge set he has todestroy or fulfill the old Law so that the new one may come into being. Hoor isthe Coptic name for Horus. In the Golden Dawn ritual chamber, their model of theuniverse, Hoor stands in the West, the darkest part of the world. As an avengingfire, he guards against the coming of Set, protecting the supreme god Osiris,who stands in the East. Osiris, especially in the Golden Dawn, was the god ofsuffering, death, and resurrection. Crowley assumed the station of Hoor inceremonies in which he symbolically defended his teacher, Samuel LiddelMacGregor Mathers (he was born Samuel Liddel Mathers and added the “MacGregor”surname later in life). And in another sense he defended the formula ofresurrection. The neophyte hall was a recreation of the judgment scene inOsirian religion. It was called the Hall of Mêêt (based on the seventh and 125thchapters of The Book of Coming Forth by Day). Modern Egyptologists would say“Maat”). Entering into the Golden Dawn, as is the case for most Western magickalsystems, was a rehearsal of death. One died (to one’s old life) and was rebornin a new life reflecting the patterns of the society. The immortality formula of the Golden Dawn reflects the idea that by sufferingone is reborn. The better parts of one’s self are tried by the vicissitudes oflife and then have a resurrection through natural processes, much as grain isresurrected by germination in earth. Crowley was opposed to the notions of deathas rest and suffering as the source of nobility. His afterlife formula also camefrom Egypt. Egyptians painted their coffins with images of starry Nuit, so thatthe dead man might copulate with the sky goddess and be reborn as the son orsun. This myth reflected the interactions of Osiris and Isis, but it has morearchaic roots. Osiris arrived in Egypt in the early dynasties, and the skyreligion was predynastic. Three important ideas of Crowley’s formula have beenplaced in the first two chapters of The Book of the Law. First, the copulationwith Nuit is the magickal model for life. Life should be lived asintercourse—active, passionate, ecstatic. This is the map to magick; it can betranslated as sex, adventure, poetry (see Shelley’s “Alastor” on page 180), drugexperiences, and so forth. Second, and this is not facilitated by gods, but theseeker actively identifies the parts of his or her own soul and consciousnesswith the male and female partners who are the model of the universe. Hadit doesnot pray to nor threaten the gods, but seeks to unite with the rest of theuniversal soul by his own forceful efforts. The nature of this union is that ofa process theology; as Hadit is united with Nuit, Nuit is enriched andtransformed, just as the sky goddess of Egypt absorbed the sun each night andgave birth to a new one each dawn. The third aspect of this triad is the child. The son or sun is ever arriving.Just as you became a new you by going to school, getting your first job, orperforming your first ritual, the new son or sun brings light and meaning andlife and desire to all things it illuminates. Each great experience changes you.Ra-Hoor-Khuit is the model and archetype of this union of greater Self andknower. Once this process of life has been observed two paths open. One can seekto actively experience the process and enrich it with experiences, struggles,and adventure, or one can choose to avoid future growth, re-creation, orenlightenment. The first path requires bravery and the willingness to accept thepains and pleasures of existence. The second path is to view life as unreal andhope for existence in some sort of static afterlife. The latter path exists asvarious forms of Christianity, Jainism, Confucianism, and other religions. Astable but serene life depends on external patterns to harmonize life. The firstpath, the path of Will, will not be stable and supreme. Notably, many areattracted to the path of Will early in their life but choose the path of harmonylater. This chapter is about the methods of war and wonder that the ever-arriving sonor sun must have. A good deal of this chapter is addressed to Crowleypersonally. III-1. Abrahadabra; the reward of Ra Hoor Khut. III-2. There is division hither homeward; there is a word not known. Spelling isdefunct; all is not aught. Beware! Hold! Raise the spell of Ra-Hoor-Khuit! III-3. Now let it be first understood that I am a god of War and of Vengeance. Ishall deal hardly with them. III-4. Choose ye an island! III-5. Fortify it! III-6. Dung it about with enginery of war! III-7. I will give you a war-engine. III-8. With it ye shall smite the peoples; and none shall stand before you. III-9. Lurk! Withdraw! Upon them! this is the Law of the Battle of Conquest:thus shall my worship be about my secret house. III-10. Get the stèlè of revealing itself; set it in thy secret temple—and thattemple is already aright disposed—& it shall be your Kiblah for ever. It shallnot fade, but miraculous colour shall come back to it day after day. Close it inlocked glass for a proof to the world. III-11. This shall be your only proof. I forbid argument. Conquer! That isenough. I will make easy to you the abstruction from the ill-ordered house inthe Victorious City. Thou shalt thyself convey it with worship, o prophet,though thou likest it not. Thou shalt have danger & trouble. Ra-Hoor-Khu is withthee. Worship me with fire & blood; worship me with swords & with spears. Letthe woman be girt with a sword before me: let blood flow to my name. Trampledown the Heathen be upon them, o warrior, I will give you of their flesh to eat! The Word of power, Abrahadabra, has a twofold effect. On one level it is acatalyst for change. When spoken with intent in a mutable situation, it cancause the situation to conform to the Will of the magickian. On the other handit effects a great long-term change by sacralizing the method of initiation.Therefore it has eleven letters, the number of change—the change in one’ssubjective universe (Nuit) made on the souless objective universe, whose nightsky is the symbol of the soul. Its numerical value is that of 418, the GreatWork. It is the formula of becoming a father to one’s Self. It begins with abra,the Hebrew word for “father”—a notion from without; from the emperor whosefishhook (Tzaddi) has caught you by mystery, you learn some magickal orphilosophical truth. The truth is then used as a thought-tool by pointconsciousness, Had, and Had produces a change—either to itself or to theuniverse it perceives—that leads Had to become the father of the ever-arrivingson or sun. One does not become an initiate by simply reading or listening. Theinitiate thinks through the idea and tests it. If results are obtained, theseresults change the nature of the initiate’s mind, which leads to a new Self. TheWord waiting to be born is Xeper; it cannot come yet because the Wills ofmagickians have not cleared the way. However, Ra-Hoor-Khuit has come into beingwithout the help of the gods, but with experimentation and daring on the part ofthe magickian. In verses III-3 to III-8, the martial nature of Ra-Hoor-Khuit is made clear. Thewar gods on the Stele of Revealing—Montu, Khonsu, and Horus Behdety—are hiscompanions. The first job of the new and renewed self is to avenge his father?Who is the enemy? Is it Set, the daemonic initiator? No, it the perceivednotions of humans. All of the aspects of culture and society must be fought ontwo planes: inside your head, where the radical perspectivism of the adept willlead one to self-discovered truth, and on an outer level. The magickian mustcreate a sanctuary, an island. The way of the Thelemite is not a hermit’s way,for he must practice both love and war, but a secure place in the objectiveuniverse is needed, an anchor for the thoughts and feelings of the ever-arrivingson. The sanctuary must be well defended, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit will provide amagickal weapon. This is a war, and Crowley is to place his estate at thecenter, just as any magickian who marries or raises a family must do, bothkeeping them safe and, by mirroring his thoughts in things of the outer world,making his mind strong. Verses III-10 and III-11 are about the sanctuary. It shall be a kiblah, a pointtoward which one turns to pray in Islam. The magickian draws his needs not bypraying to a god but by praying to his or her emotional center. Now, the familyof a spike-collar butch in San Francisco might look different from aheterosexual pair-bonded family with three kids and a dog in Kansas, but in eachcase, it is a family. Crowley chose his sanctuary at Boleskine. These versesdeal with the emotional center of the magickian. The magickian must overcome;remember that Khonsu was said to make a placenta for the pharaoh from the bloodof his enemies. The magickian is not slaying foes in any visible sense, but asthe foe’s teachings are forgotten, they energetically nourish the ever-arrivingson. Crowley did not steal the Stele of Revealing from Cairo, the Victorious City(Al-Kahira, “the victorious”). In the end he sold Boleskine, seeking to gainenough money to kickstart the OTO, but his treasurer took the money and ran.Crowley, who despised the standard notions of family, never fully learned how tosuccessfully have his own. Note that women in his system are warriors; thebetter parts of Crowley understood the nobility and fierceness of women. As amember of a “wild-eyed” Protestant group, Crowley would likely have come acrossThe Two Babylons, a book written in 1853 by Scottish Protestant AlexanderHislop, who described a sword-wearing queen, Semiramis. In Hislop’s overblownconspiracy, Semiramis invented polytheism to vampirically gain the worship ofher subjects, who had been faithful to the God of the book of Genesis. Shedeified herself as Ishtar and her son as Gilgamesh. This view of Babylon wouldhave been part of the Plymouth Brethren “idea-scape” for the young Crowley. Thisodd and colorful notion has vanished from our world, except for Jack Chicktracts. III-12. Sacrifice cattle, little and big: after a child. III-13. But not now. III-14. Ye shall see that hour, o blessèd Beast, and thou the Scarlet Concubineof his desire! III-15. Ye shall be sad thereof. III-16. Deem not too eagerly to catch the promises; fear not to undergo thecurses. Ye, even ye, know not this meaning all. III-17. Fear not at all; fear neither men nor Fates, nor gods, nor anything.Money fear not, nor laughter of the folk folly, nor any other power in heaven orupon the earth or under the earth. Nu is your refuge as Hadit your light; and Iam the strength, force, vigour, of your arms. III-18. Mercy let be off; damn them who pity! Kill and torture; spare not; beupon them! III-19. That stélé they shall call the Abomination of Desolation; count well itsname, & it shall be to you as 718. III-20. Why? Because of the fall of Because, that he is not there again. III-21. Set up my image in the East: thou shalt buy thee an image which I willshow thee, especial, not unlike the one thou knowest. And it shall be suddenlyeasy for thee to do this. III-22. The other images group around me to support me: let all be worshipped,for they shall cluster to exalt me. I am the visible object of worship; theothers are secret; for the Beast & his Bride are they: and for the winners ofthe Ordeal x. What is this? Thou shalt know. Verses III-12 to III-15 seem to foretell the births and deaths of two ofCrowley’s children. When our new magickal self comes into being, it possessesuncanny sight. Parts of the unfolding of the world have been fixed and cannot bealtered; other parts are subject to our Will. The magickal parts of ourselvescan give us great energy by revealing glimpses of the future, but it must beremembered that great energy does not always mean happy energy. The home andhome life of the magickian are his or her sacred center; from them come themagick that gives the daily bread, heals the sick, and casts out lesser piecesof bad programming in the magickian and his kith and kin. Verses III-16 and III-17 offer advice to Crowley, which can apply to anymagickian. In the first verse attitudes toward events are discussed. Magickiansbeckon many anomalous events and people toward them. Being all too human theyrush to interpret these events and often become ensnared in processes that ifnot met with detachment would ensnare them. Think of the Taoist fable of thehorse. A farmer discovers that his fields are being trampled at night. Hisneighbors say, “Woe is you, the gods hate you.” The farmer says, “We will see.”The farmer discovers a beautiful white stallion is the culprit, and the farmer’sson catches and tames the beast. His neighbors say, “Happiness unto you, thegods must love you!” The farmer says, “We will see.” The son, who takes toriding the white stallion, is thrown and breaks his leg. His neighbors say, “Woeis you, the gods hate you.” The farmer says, “We will see.” The emperor starts awar and all able-bodied young men are drafted. The son, who is still wearing asplint, stays home. His neighbors say, “Happiness unto you, the gods must loveyou!” The farmer says, “We will see.” Verse III-17 lists those events that occurin the lives of anyone attempting something new. In verse III-18, the theme of no mercy and no compassion arises again. NeitherCrowley nor Ra-Hoor-Khuit is cold or heartless. As Nietzsche argues in ThusSpoke Zarathustra, when humans rush to help a pitied person, they are rushing tohelp that person accept his “fate” and deny the possibility that the sufferermay need his anguish, which is intertwined with his joy. In The Gay Science,Nietzsche says, “No, the ‘religion of pity’ commands them to help, and theybelieve that they have helped most when they have helped most quickly.” In fact,Eugene Grosche (a.k.a. Gregor Gregorius), founder of a Thelemic organizationcalled Fraternitas Saturni (Brotherhood of Saturn), called love under Will“compassionless love.” Verse III-19 confounded Crowley for many years; what stele was numbered at 718?Then he noticed that the combination of the numeric value of the word stele (52,in Greek) and beast (666) equals 718! But there is a secondary meaning. InHebrew 718 is the numeric value of the Hebrew verb that means “rebuke.” Thestele of “Abomination of Desolation,” the stele of Revealing, rebukes theAbrahamic religions. Verse III-22 explains that unlike the universal abstractions of Nuit and Hadit,Ra-Hoor-Khuit can be worshipped by those humans who need an external symbol. Forthe masses an idolatry of Horus will aid them in coming to understand Thelema.But all forms of the pagan revival are suitable as folk religions. The moralform of these religions will end the harsh morality of the Abrahamic faiths.Those who have passed “Ordeal x” are those humans who realize that Crowley’sWork as Magus and Ipsissimus has made him into an image for their own process,by which they may each bridge the gap between their lower (less perfect, lesspermanent) Self and their Higher (more perfect, more permanent) Self. III-23. For perfume mix meal & honey & thick leavings of red wine: then oil ofAbramelin and olive oil, and afterward soften & smooth down with rich freshblood. III-24. The best blood is of the moon, monthly: then the fresh blood of a child,or dropping from the host of heaven: then of enemies; then of the priest or ofthe worshippers: last of some beast, no matter what. III-25. This burn: of this make cakes & eat unto me. This hath also another use;let it be laid before me, and kept thick with perfumes of your orison: it shallbecome full of beetles as it were and creeping things sacred unto me. III-26. These slay, naming your enemies; & they shall fall before you. III-27. Also these shall breed lust & power of lust in you at the eatingthereof. III-28. Also ye shall be strong in war. III-29. Moreover, be they long kept, it is better; for they swell with my force.All before me. III-30. My altar is of open brass work: burn thereon in silver or gold! III-31. There cometh a rich man from the West who shall pour his gold upon thee. III-32. From gold forge steel! III-33. Be ready to fly or to smite! Verse III-23 instructs Crowley in making a personal perfume. We access memorythrough smell. It is a key in bringing us to a higher awareness to make perfumesin an exalted state and wear them in our ordinary lives; this pulls us towardever more exalted awareness. Likewise others remember us by our smells, and wefurther our magickal influence over them by making them remember an aspect ofour magick. On the other hand people who met Crowley often thought he smelledlike a candy shop, and his recipe for oil of Abramelin tends to scald the skin.Crowley had his starting point for the recipe in MacGregor Mathers’s faultytranslation of The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage. A much morecomplete compilation and translation by Georg Dehn and Steven Guth gives a morereasonable formula: “Take one part of the best myrrh, half a part of cinnamon,one part of cassia, one part galanga root, and a quarter of the combined totalweight of good, fresh olive oil. Make these into an ointment or oil as is doneby the chemists. Keep it in a clean container until you need it. Put thecontainer together with the other accessories in the cupboard under the altar.”Crowley also called it the “oil of aspiration,” in that it comes to permeate allthings in the magickian’s world with the desire to pursue the Great Work, theknowledge and conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. The Great Work issymbolized by the Word Abrahadabra, hence its inclusion as a magickal techniquein this chapter. Verse III-24 is lost on the sensationalist press. The “child” is of course themagickian himself or herself as the ever-arriving son. If the initiatory processhas begun, the substances of the body—especially sexual fluid, tears, saliva,and blood—are symbols of the magickian’s unbending Will. If the magickian hasfound a female beloved, her menstrual blood, that is, partaking of the materialsof life, is very potent. The scarlet woman is an exact outward mapping of themagickian’s psyche; by adoring her, he adores Nuit. Each action born of love isa perfect magickal action causing the knower and the Great Self to have union.Each action not only calls forth the ever-arriving son but also magickalchildren in the outer world who receive the spiritual DNA of the magickian andthe scarlet woman at times when such a projection of seed allows the coming intobeing of a new magickal soul. Thus in a group of earnest seekers, the sex magickof the magickian and his scarlet woman will actually allow the earnest seeker totake in new patterns of becoming and advance quickly in his or her initiation.This is the new æon’s form of the mass of the Holy Spirit. Thus in verse III-25 the formula of the mass is laid bare. But a second use, asort of insectile voodoo, is also revealed. Just as your enemies live off ofyour energy, insects will live off of the cakes of light. Thus the connectionbetween these vermin and your enemies is an exact parallelism, and you may slayyour enemies by killing these bugs. In verses III-27 to III-29 other virtues ofthe mass are listed, in that feeding on your desire shall make desire grow.Unlike the Buddha, who warned us that desire causes suffering, Ra-Hoor-Khuitsays to increase desire as a way of fueling one’s growth, and the verses let usknow a magickal technique for this. Verse III-30 says that the traditional brassand bronze are the metals associated with Horus, versus iron for Set. Verses III-31 to III-33 seem to be personal words for Crowley. They did motivatehim to meet various German occultists, seek out seekers in California, and soforth. This ensured a level of activity. As might be expected of a priest ofMontu, the warrior god whose name means “nomad,” fighting and fleeing are alwaysutmost in the mind. III-34. But your holy place shall be untouched throughout the centuries: thoughwith fire and sword it be burnt down & shattered, yet an invisible house therestandeth, and shall stand until the fall of the Great Equinox; when Hrumachisshall arise and the double-wanded one assume my throne and place. Anotherprophet shall arise, and bring fresh fever from the skies; another woman shallawake the lust & worship of the Snake; another soul of God and beast shallmingle in the globèd priest; another sacrifice shall stain the tomb; anotherking shall reign; and blessing no longer be poured To the Hawk-headed mysticalLord! III-35. The half of the word of Heru-ra-ha, called Hoor-pa-kraat andRa-Hoor-Khut. Crowley’s mother had prepared him to see himself as the Antichrist, thedestroyer of an age; Nietzsche had prepared him to be the superman, revitalizinga new world. Hrumachis is Horus of the sunset and the fall equinox, thecounterpoint of spring. There will be a revitalization of the æon, because ofnew magickal systems called into being by the Book’s coming into being. The æon is dedicated to Horus the Child and Horus as Ra of Timelessness. Eachhas a different face and force. It is to be noted that the figure of Horus theChild does not appear on the Stele of Revealing, and reflects a need in AleisterCrowley’s soul. Why a child? In Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Nietzsche speaks of theevolution of the soul. It begins as a camel, a beast of burden that must do whatit is told. It dreams of revolting against its master, a dragon named ThouShalt! The camel caught in its system of guilt and obligations is a Christian.In its camel form, it can fight, so it staggers off into the desert and becomesa lion. As a lion it can fight on behalf of its desires; it can say a final anddevastating “No!” to Thou Shalt! Free of the dragon, it becomes a child, acreature at play with the universe, a creature of Will who can say “Yes!” to allthings that come along. Why Ra of Timelessness? In the new æon, eternal returnis welcome. There has been much nonsense said of Nietzsche’s doctrine of eternalreturn; it does not mean exactly the same events happening over and over. Itwould be sad enough to be in a universe of one Auschwitz or one 9/11, yet alonecountless ones. Eternal return signifies that there is no progress in humanlives. We shall have war and joy, peace and depression, poverty and prosperityin our lives. The superman does not live for an invisible after-death state; heis loyal to the Earth. He says “Yes!” to all things, because by following hisWill, he will find joy in all things. III-36. Then said the prophet unto the God: III-37. I adore thee in the song— I am the Lord of Thebes, and I The inspired forth-speaker of Mentu; For me unveils the veilèd sky, The self-slain Ankh-af-na-khonsu Whose words are truth. I invoke, I greet Thy presence, O Ra-Hoor-Khuit! Unity uttermost showed! I adore the might of Thy breath, Supreme and terrible God, Who makest the gods and death To tremble before Thee:— I, I adore thee! Appear on the throne of Ra! Open the ways of the Khu! Lighten the ways of the Ka! The ways of the Khabs run through To stir me or still me! Aum! let it fill me! These are Crowley’s verses based on the translation of the eleven linesappearing on the front of the stele. Crowley takes the place of the Montu priestAnkh-ef-en-Khonsu and celebrates Ra-Hoor-Khuit. Ra-Hoor-Khuit is saluted as agod of the mind and the maker of other abstractions such as gods and death, andhe is invoked to allow Crowley’s destiny, or khu, to become open, in short, tosend a wave into the future (quantum physics types will think of this as anoffering wave) to bring back a pathway (an echo wave). The burdens of thetimeless soul, the ka, are lightened; the ba, or becoming soul, shall stillsuffer, but the miracle-producing soul will have help. The lives of otherhumans—the khabs—are summoned to inspire and occasionally to stop Crowley (inthe Gurdjieffian sense). These verses are great beginning verses for anyone nearthe start of his or her initiation. III-38. So that thy light is in me; & its red flame is as a sword in my hand topush thy order. There is a secret door that I shall make to establish thy way inall the quarters, (these are the adorations, as thou hast written), as it issaid: The light is mine; its rays consume > Me: I have made a secret door Into the House of Ra and Tum, > Of Khephra and of Ahathoor. I am thy Theban, O Mentu, > The prophet Ankh-af-na-khonsu! By Bes-na-Maut my breast I beat; > By wise Ta-Nech I weave my spell. Show thy star-splendour, O Nuit! > Bid me within thine House to dwell, O wingèd snake of light, Hadit! > Abide with me, Ra-Hoor-Khuit! Crowley identifies with the god and takes in his power and light (in Egyptianterms, his sekhem). He makes the path of the sun, or Khephra (the dawn), Hathoor(the hidden time, night), Ra (noon), and Tum*4[CR%21XKH88GDSZ52D3DFGXSBK3FPMAAQE_split_022.html#filepos911906] (setting sun),a secret path. In other words he will teach the adoration of this natural symbol as a way forthe initiate to discover that what is holy is not the sun without, but aphenomena like it—the new self, the ever-arriving son within. He invokes thephysical parents of Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu, Bes-na-Maut and Ta-Nech, as analogues ofHadit and Nuit, just as our parents are symbols of the parts of our soul-bodycomplex before self-actualization begins. III-39. All this and a book to say how thou didst come hither and a reproductionof this ink and paper for ever—for in it is the word secret & not only in theEnglish—and thy comment upon this the Book of the Law shall be printedbeautifully in red ink and black upon beautiful paper made by hand; and to eachman and woman that thou meetest, were it but to dine or to drink at them, it isthe Law to give. Then they shall chance to abide in this bliss or no; it is noodds. Do this quickly! III-40. But the work of the comment? That is easy; and Hadit burning in thyheart shall make swift and secure thy pen. III-41. Establish at thy Kaaba a clerk-house: all must be done well and withbusiness way. The book should be made available, since Crowley is establishing a new contextfor the world; it must be made available to all. This is a practical matter, nota mystical one. III-42. The ordeals thou shalt oversee thyself, save only the blind ones. Refusenone, but thou shalt know & destroy the traitors. I am Ra-Hoor-Khuit; and I ampowerful to protect my servant. Success is thy proof: argue not; convert not;talk not over much! Them that seek to entrap thee, to overthrow thee, themattack without pity or quarter; & destroy them utterly. Swift as a troddenserpent turn and strike! Be thou yet deadlier than he! Drag down their souls toawful torment: laugh at their fear: spit upon them! III-43. Let the Scarlet Woman beware! If pity and compassion and tendernessvisit her heart; if she leave my work to toy with old sweetnesses; then shall myvengeance be known. I will slay me her child: I will alienate her heart: I willcast her out from men: as a shrinking and despised harlot shall she crawlthrough dusk wet streets, and die cold and an-hungered. III-44. But let her raise herself in pride! Let her follow me in my way! Let herwork the work of wickedness! Let her kill her heart! Let her be loud andadulterous! Let her be covered with jewels, and rich garments, and let her beshameless before all men! III-45. Then will I lift her to pinnacles of power: then will I breed from her achild mightier than all the kings of the earth. I will fill her with joy: withmy force shall she see & strike at the worship of Nu: she shall achieve Hadit. Crowley is to become an initiator, but this has a price; when you set up theconditions for men and women to grow strong, you strengthen both their worst andbest features. Humans with weak Will who become initiates will turn on you anddestroy you. Indeed, during one’s time as Magus, everyone who enters your lifeis strangely empowered to give you bliss or woe. Crowley’s path had a strangedoom, as most sex magickians often discover. Magi, whether male or female(consider the path of Blavatsky or Ayn Rand’s affairs), have an impressiveeffect on the psyches of fragmented yet desirable souls. One neither knows nordeclares oneself a Magus—one has to pass into a distillation of the soul so thatone becomes a force for a single idea. If we consider human thought as a vastlake, Magi are boulders hurled onto its surface. Alcoholics, neurotics, andobsessive-compulsives suddenly shine in the presence of the Magus. Their worldsand their lives rain energy, sex, money, and good luck on him or her. If theyregain themselves in this interlude they are saved, but most likely the charmwears off and they fall into fragments—with madness and death being a commonfate for many of Crowley’s scarlet women. The only alternative to this is thecreation of a school of male and female initiates who seek the Magus to meet himor her with a strength of Will focused on a common purpose. III-46. I am the warrior Lord of the Forties: the Eighties cower before me, &are abased. I will bring you to victory & joy: I will be at your arms in battle& ye shall delight to slay. Success is your proof; courage is your armour; goon, go on, in my strength; & ye shall turn not back for any! III-47. This book shall be translated into all tongues: but always with theoriginal in the writing of the Beast; for in the chance shape of the letters andtheir position to one another: in these are mysteries that no Beast shalldivine. Let him not seek to try: but one cometh after him, whence I say not, whoshall discover the Key of it all. Then this line drawn is a key: then thiscircle squared in its failure is a key also. And Abrahadabra. It shall be hischild & that strangely. Let him not seek after this; for thereby alone can hefall from it. These verses say that in the years of the New Æon, the forties (1944– 1954) andthe eighties (1984–1994) shall be crucial times. The Book of the Law came intoexistence in the year 1904, so these years would be 40 AH to 50 AH (Æon ofHorus). In the forties we saw Crowley’s death, the births of Michael Aquino,Stephen Edred Flowers, James Lewis, Utterer of the Word Remanifest in the Templeof Set, and Lilith Sinclair, Utterer of the Word Arkte in the Temple of Set. Theutterance of the Word MAnifestatION by Frater Achad, and filmmaker and authorKenneth Grant, made them realize that Set, or Typhon, was the god of the age. Inthe eighties we saw the “Satanic Panic,” where a superstitious outrage againstvarious pagan groups ruined lives—and often set pagan groups against oneanother. I joined the Temple of Set, James Lewis uttered the WordRemanifestation, and Stephen Edred Flowers uttered the Word Runa. The “key to itall” is Frater Achad’s discovery that AL/God = 31, ShT/Set = 31, LA = Nothing,and 31 + 31 + 31 = 93. The “circle squared in its failure” reflects themathematical work of German mathematician Georg Cantor (1845–1918), whose workon the circle shows that it is composed of an infinite number (Nuit) ofinfinitely small straight sides (the infinitesimal, or Hadit), yet is anobservable finite object, which can be of different sizes. The interrelationshipof Thelema is beyond the scope of this small book, but Thelemites would do wellto look at the words of Georg Cantor, Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann, andAustrian American logician, mathematician, and philosopher Kurt Gödel todiscover useful ways of understanding the world-picture that holds Thelema. III-48. Now this mystery of the letters is done, and I want to go on to theholier place. III-49. I am in a secret fourfold word, the blasphemy against all gods of men. III-50. Curse them! Curse them! Curse them! III-51. With my Hawk’s head I peck at the eyes of Jesus as he hangs upon thecross. III-52. I flap my wings in the face of Mohammed & blind him. III-53. With my claws I tear out the flesh of the Indian and the Buddhist,Mongol and Din. III-54. Bahlasti! Ompehda! I spit on your crapulous creeds. III-55. Let Mary inviolate be torn upon wheels: for her sake let all chastewomen be utterly despised among you! III-56. Also for beauty’s sake and love’s! III-57. Despise also all cowards; professional soldiers who dare not fight, butplay; all fools despise! III-58. But the keen and the proud, the royal and the lofty; ye are brothers! III-59. As brothers fight ye! III-60. There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt. In verse III-48, the lesser mysteries—those found by gematria and observing thetimes—are finished. Since such mysteries reflect, as I have warned you, theneeds of the day-to-day self, they are not the basis for inner work. They arethe basis of sorcery or medial magick. Greater Black Magick (GBM) changes thesoul of the operator, The Book of the Law being a stellar example. Medial BlackMagick (MBM) are those operations, which change the perceptual universe inaccordance with the Will of the magickian; tying knots in a string to bind twopeople together would be a common example. Lesser Black Magick (LBM) is thecontrolling of others by manipulating their preconscious; a Super Bowladvertisement would be an example of LBM. White Magick is the submitting of thesoul to a prefabricated divine principle; saying the Lord’s Prayer or recitingmost mantras would be an example of White Magick. As you can see all fourflavors of magick are found in (or can be derived from) The Book of the Law. Allof these forces must Work together transforming both Crowley (the microcosm),his followers (the mesocosm), and the world (the macrocosm). Such threefoldtransformation is the field of operations of the Magus. The matters that followare holy, which in this case is the holy “No!” that slays the dragon Thou Shalt!Verse III-49, is, by the way, the sacred number of John Dee, court astrologer ofQueen Elizabeth I and creator of the term “British Empire.” A rather successfulpiece of Lesser Black Magick refers to the fourfold Word of “Do what thou wilt!”This is the sacred “No!” that ends existing creeds that make humans small. Thevoces magicae (magickal words) of bahlasti and ompehda seem to be a curseformula, but no clear etymology has suggested itself to me (howeverinterpretations abound on the World Wide Web). By verse III-56, the anger of the sacred “No!” is amplified by references to thequests for the beautiful and the beloved. These human needs are denied by thecreeds that the new æon must destroy. Verses III-57 and III-58 speak againstthat class that Nietzsche calls “slaves”—those people who despise their mastersand define evil as all of the noble things their masters are. This contrastswith the masters, who first define themselves by deed and reason, and thenassert as good and noble all others who show their virtues, however differentthey may appear on the outside. Verse III-59 shows that not only is conflictinevitable, but conflict among humans who are pledged to the good and the truewill lead to greater understanding. This is a great test for the school theseeker will choose: Does it allow for diversity, even heated argument within thebonds of sorority and fraternity? Or does it exalt the opinions of a charismaticleader above all? Verse III-60, which is keyed to samekh—the formula thatCrowley used to invoke the Holy Guardian Angel—is the Law restated; thus if onefollows “Do what thou wilt,” one will encounter the best parts of his or hersoul and become a master. III-61. There is an end of the word of the God enthroned in Ra’s seat,lightening the girders of the soul. III-62. To Me do ye reverence! to me come ye through tribulation of ordeal,which is bliss. III-63. The fool readeth this The Book of the Law, and its comment; & heunderstandeth it not. III-64. Let him come through the first ordeal, & it will be to him as silver. III-65. Through the second, gold. III-66. Through the third, stones of precious water. III-67. Through the fourth, ultimate sparks of the intimate fire. III-68. Yet to all it shall seem beautiful. Its enemies who say not so, are mereliars. III-69. There is success. III-70. I am the Hawk-Headed Lord of Silence & of Strength; my nemyss shroudsthe night-blue sky. III-71. Hail! ye twin warriors about the pillars of the world! for your time isnigh at hand. Verse III-61 reveals that there is a purpose, a telos, to this Word. Divineintervention is occurring because the Divine has an agenda. It is not a human orhumane agenda; the principle of Will’s only good is its expansion andmaintenance in the world of humans. The years that are to come will attack thisprinciple with growing technological and social forces to smother the Will underthe mass thoughts of the many, the slaves. As noted earlier, to me is Greek for“a cutting, part of a plant that has been cultivated.” We are not one with theDivine, but small beings that can grow to be divine. It is us, the cutting, inour struggles to become a mighty tree that is to be reverenced. To love God, youmust love each human step toward godhood, say “Yes!” to your struggles, andadmire the Will to power in all humans at all times and in all climes. In verse III-63, the fool stands for Crowley himself. It is the fate of all Magito struggle to utter their own Word. Thus each one never has an easy time ofunderstanding the Word his or her followers will have. The Magus’s task istwain: he must explain his Word in rational terms and also provide access to themagickal inspiration behind it. Thus those who follow have the roadmap, whichthe Magus never had, and a community to explore his or her growing connectionsto the principle. The ordeals reflect the growth of the soul. The first ordeal is breaking withthe current æon and mass thought. The result is a simple paganism, a joy at joyand a love for the Earth and moon. The second is the discovery of the sovereignself, wherein one becomes like Horus, illuminating one’s world with meaning andlight. The third is the discovery of the powers that focus the self—magick andyoga—wherein a certain crystallization takes places that makes the Self adivining device like unto John Dee’s shewstone. John Dee possessed an Aztecobsidian mirror sacred to Tezcatlipoca; with this treasure of Spanishcolonialism he and his assistant Edward Kelly (whom Crowley claimed as aprevious incarnation) obtained a series of visions that resulted in theso-called “Enochian system,” which was a major magickal engine of the GoldenDawn, the Church of Satan, and the Temple of Set. Magick does not lie in thetools but in the Self. The tools are metaphors that can be manipulated. The lastordeal is transcending the self in its current matrix of biology and culture andbecoming an immortal, potent, and powerful essence that is like a flame. In twoinspired Works, received (much in the manner of Crowley’s The Book of the Law)without knowledge of one another in 1974 and 1975—Maggie Cook’s/Nema’s LiberPennae Praenumbra and Michael Aquino’s The Book of Coming Forth by Night—thisflame is seen as black. It is noteworthy that the authors of the first work saidto be Horus and Set conjoined, speaking with the “same mouth,” whereas the voiceof latter work is Set speaking of his recent union with Horus (1966–1975 CE, or63–72 AH). Verses III-64 to III-67 indicate the extreme beauty in each path, whether thebeautiful religion of Wicca (silver), the brash, self-exalting politics of AynRand (gold), the crystallization of the Fourth Way Work of Gurdjieff (preciousstones), or the Temple of Set and the Rune-Gild (intimate sparks of fire). Eachmay not understand or value the other, but all are mankind’s childlike attemptsto throw off the ice of monotheism. It is in this multiple dialogue, which comesfrom those throwing off the shackles of the Æon of Osiris, that success willcome. This is revealed in verse III-69, the ultimate significator of spiritualdialogue. In verse III-70, the hawk-headed lord, clearly Horus the Elder, standsforth in strength (in Egyptian, sekhem) and in silence—the magickal virtue ofthe Sphinx. Most would-be magickians chatter incessantly on the inner work theyare trying to do, not unlike an insane farmer who digs up his seeds every day tosee if they have sprouted. If you wish your Will to become powerful, speak ofyour successes, not of your ongoing projects. Teach the world that you are avictor, not a talker. In verse III-71, the twin brothers are Set and Horus,performing the samtaui—the binding of Upper and Lower Egypt around the worldpillar. This ancient union of the night, Set, and inner work with the day,Horus, and outer sovereignty and adventure is how the new æon shall be ruled.Seventy years after the reception of The Book of the Law, Michael Aquino calledon Set, the Prince of Darkness, and received The Book of Coming Forth by Night,the other half of the magickal formula that Ra-Hoor-Khuit promised. III-72. I am the Lord of the Double Wand of Power; the wand of the Force of CophNia—but my left hand is empty, for I have crushed an Universe; & nought remains. III-73. Paste the sheets from right to left and from top to bottom: then behold! III-74. There is a splendour in my name hidden and glorious, as the sun ofmidnight is ever the son. In verse III-72, Ra-Hoor-Khuit, the magickian born of the focus of the Self,Hadit, and the greater Self ’s contents, Nuit, reveals his magickal weaponry. Hepossesses the Double Wand of Power in his right hand. In the Stele of RevealingRa-Hoor-Khuit holds a was scepter, a Set-headed wand that symbolizes power. Hehas passed the scepter from his left hand, which in Egyptian art signifiesreceptivity to his right hand, which signifies action. It has become both a wasscepter and a djam scepter, the later signifying power through offspring.Ra-Hoor-Khuit assumes rulership and extends his rulership through his children,who will change the world in accordance with his Will and their own. In his lefthand are the remains of the old æon, crushed through the sacred “No!”—theantinomianism of the Left-Hand Path. These scepters traditionally have the powerto control serpents, which has reference both to the imitator in the Garden ofEden and lust on command as well. Crowley originally heard the word coph,probably the Egyptian verb Setians spell and mispronounce as xeper. Xeper notonly speaks of the willed act of coming into being, but also that one’s cominginto being cause others deeds and events to come into being and shape the world.Despite Aiwass’s injunction to change not a letter, Crowley allowed Rose toalter this word to “Coph Nia.” Notably 72 is magickally significant as thenumber of Set’s confederates who killed Osiris. Verse III-73 alerts Crowley to mysteries hidden in the pages he has written.This makes clear that this is divine communication that will produce ecstaticrevelations, the fuel of the magickian’s soul as he (and others) will decipherthe text. In Crowley’s sun worship, the sun at midnight is the god Khephra,another cult title for Khepra. The “sun of midnight” in verse III-74 is a symbol of initiation—the moment oftruth that can come forth only in darkness and mystery. The nature of theever-arriving son is again restated here in verse III-74. The last verse summonsup the process and encodes a Word of magickal power: Abrahadabra! III-75. The ending of the words is the Word Abrahadabra. The Book of the Law is Writtenand Concealed.Aum. Ha The book is done, Crowley’s life will be forever altered, and as he comes intobeing as the Magus of Thelema; the way of coming into being for all who will usethat Word to awaken their Will has been established. The Book of the Law is thefather (abra) that is reborn through contemplation (had) and then shapes theworld as the initiate becomes the new father (abra). The concluding mantra iscomposed of the Sanskrit syllable aun plus the letter “m,” which is the sum ofall vibration in the universe—“Aum” is home and “Ha” is the secret name ofHorus—born anew from the cleansed and beautified psyche of the magickian. "},{"pageContent":"The Grade of Magus > > Changing Perception is the Great Work. THE BOOK OF THE HEB-SED*5[CR%21XKH88GDSZ52D3DFGXSBK3FPMAAQE_split_022.html#filepos912358] Amethyst is a lovely word. Like most Greek words beginning with the letter“alpha,” it means “anti-” something. The rest of the word (the meth part) refersto a drink made from honey. Amethysts were carried as antidrunkenness charms.The Indo-European languages abound with words for honey-derived drinks, consider“mead” in English. “Antimad” equals amethyst. The grade of Magus is somewhatlike a painful period of sobriety in a drunken world. Little analysis of thisgrade has happened since Crowley’s time; I would like to offer some observationsthat may be of help to the Crowley students. My observations reflect only thedevelopment of one of the strands of Crowley’s thought; other schools will havedeveloped differently. There is little written on the grade of Magus, and we take Crowley as anauthority. I would like to make some brief comments about the condition theMagus finds himself or herself in. The Temple of Set holds that the Master of the Temple is isolated in his or herunderstanding of the universe. This isolation has come from experimentation inthe objective universe, synthesized with subjective understanding of the self. The Magus is changed by this isolated understanding in a manner different fromthe Master. The Magus’s understanding is in synch with divine will as mediatedby the æon. Or in simpler terms, three things align: the personal intent of theMagus to know his or her Self, the lack of certain ideas that are needed for theæon to Xeper, and the Will of the Prince of Darkness. The task of the Magus isto produce changes in the objective universe that reflect eternal values, and todo so requires that the Magus violate certain commonly held opinions and moresof the Temple of Set. These changes must be spurs to the Xeper of sinceremembers of the Temple of Set. The changes will radiate beyond the Temple intothe greater human world, in both direct and “magickal” ways. The Magus is bound by certain constraints. Although the ideas expressed by theWords of a Magus are beyond any human language, the Magus must present them inthe words that frame the idea for him or her. This links the idea to both itsprevious manifestations and to the personal history of the Magus. Lewis couldnot have cast remanifestation as the Greek epiphany, nor could Flowers havetranslated runa into the Egyptian shta-tu. If Crowley had called Thelema “Will,”it would not have the same magickal keys, nor would it have worked if Aquinoused “Become” or if I had used “I have Come Into Being.” The Magus has a great twofold process that leads him or her to the change inperception. The first is the experience of divine illumination. We can call thisnoesis or, using the terminology of American philosopher Charles SaundersPierce, “abduction.” The Magus experiences in a living conscious moment anaspect of a gift, also called a charitas or an inn; the Prince of Darknessreveals to him or her what has been within him or her all along. Thisillumination causes certain effects that are described below; it also gives thereceiver certain powers and responsibilities. Sadly, since we live in aconsumerist, modern world we don’t understand that a gift implies a traditionand system of exchange that maintains the ties not only between the giver andthe receiver but also between their social cosmoses as well. The method ofillumination is determined by and reflects the Word in form (e.g., “hearing” aWord, receiving a book, ecstatic trance, etc.). This aspect of the Magus’sexperience cannot be quantified. The second aspect is what I call theegg-on-the-face moment. The Magus discovers that all understandable aspects ofhis or her life have always reflected the principle revealed to him or her. Magican find their Word in the first ritual they ever wrote or in ten articles theyhave done over the years. Various thoughts will occur to him or her: “Does everysingle person in the Temple but me know this?” and “God, why am I so slow?” Butit gets worse—much worse. Other things begin to come to light. A poem from thesecond grade that his or her mother saved, lines from a favorite movie fromjunior high, a college friend who reminisces about the night you all got stonedand ate that raw cookie dough and then asks, “And you kept talking about X-idea;are you still into that?” This aspect of the Magus’s experience can bequantified and demonstrated. I assure you all, Set is a high school teacher, andwe are in the remedial class. The Setian understanding of magick tells us that making a change in thesubjective universe produces a proportionate change in the objective universe.The intersection of immanent (Set has spoken to me) and transcendental (I havebeen working on this idea ceaselessly every time I have made myself better)changes the objective universe of the Magus unalterably. I will discuss thischange in five steads: the graal, the theater of the Word, the workshop, themagnetization, and the other Words. Each of these steads is to some extentactive in the priesthood and both active and perceived in the Magistry. Everyonereading this book will have experienced these things, but if you will allow me ageeky metaphor, you have experienced gravity while walking on the moon, but theMagus is experiencing it while walking on the surface of Jupiter. Because theMasters have experienced these phenomena, they are able to perceive the Word ona personal and subjective level as well as on a rational basis that any thinkinghuman could use to examine the Word on a philosophical level. THE GRAAL Human beings live in the world of becoming. They age, they fart, they forget,they work, they play; humans require energy in all of their aspects. Food fortheir carnal selves, love for their emotional selves, ideas and data for theirintellectual selves, and the graal for their daemonic selves. Different humanshave different needs; some humans may need lots of food because of their hardphysical labor, but only need to see the candles of midnight Mass every fewChristmases. Magi are in the presence of the graal, which is said to bring forthonly their favorite food. Every magickal and spiritual experience is now cast inthe form of their Word. Likewise this affects their lives very erratically. Whenthey get a portion of their food, they have an output that makes any of theirprevious output seem like they were standing still. But deprive them of theirfood and they lapse into depression and physical sickness. One may compare thedrive of the Magus to that of a quest for water in the desert. THE THEATER OF THE WORD The ritual chamber and the laboratory of the Magus is the objective universe.This does not mean that the Magus suddenly finds life easy. Instead he or shefinds life traditional; that is, he or she lives in a world where the symbolicact is real. Other humans become actors in a play to teach him or her, and theyprovide a place for the Magus to deliver great soliloquies. One of the bestexamples of this would be the Magic Castle Working, when Michael Aquino tookStephen Edred Flowers to the Magic Castle in Hollywood to give him an S.S.dagger. To normal humans, it would have been a friend giving another friend anexquisite gift. For Magus Flowers it was a Sword Giving. The drama of the Magushas three aspects. First, it is an objectification of the unknown or unmanifest;in other words the Magus doesn’t know how the play is going to end. This qualityis essential; the ritual drama is the means whereby the Magus gains more being.If he or she knew the end of the play, there would be little learned from it. Itis also often less than fun. Second the Magus engages in play with the existingstructures of the world. A Magus who preaches against the sins of the world maygain followers, but not thinkers. The Magus who changes the world with humoropens space for thought and growth. Third, in addition to the theater of theWord having both comedy and tragedy, it has farce. The Magus is drawing oneternal patterns that are contraindicated by social opinions and mores. So someof the aspects of the Temple will look petty to the Magus. If you can imagine,this would be something like Einstein being told that his theories were badbecause he was Jewish (which of course did happen). This social dynamic is veryfrustrating, even soul deadening. It has good effect; the theater of the Wordensures that those aspects of the Word that need to be strengthened will be andthat things blocking the Great Work will be removed from the Magus’s life.Although for our timeless selves this is play, it can (and will) hurt like hellfor immanent Selves. There is a danger in the theater. The Magus will want tohang out with people who are attuned to his or her Word and avoid others. Thisis partially fine; it creates a secure dialogue, but if the Magus cuts offothers too much, the Word becomes weaker, much as an unexercised muscle growsflabby. THE WORKSHOP The Persians had ritual specialists called the maagush, who were the guys youcontacted when you wanted to know how to make things happen. Their name comes tous via Greek and Latin as Magi. Ritual specialists are the folks who teach youhow to make a change. A priest prays for you. The ritual specialist tells youwhat ritual to perform for you to cause change. The Magus must develop techniquefirst and foremost. Do this and you will get results. This imparts experienceand is a check against deception. Books and other writings are important (Idon’t care if they are pictographs painted in a cave or words on a web-site),but it must be remembered that books are a touchstone for future people testingtheir understanding after the Magus is gone. Books work best for humans whoseinitiatory level is just below the material they are reading. The best form ofpassing the Word is by a living teacher teaching a living student. Then thestudents become teachers. This does not mean the Magus should not write, butthat writing is a tool for the preservation of the Word in the world. The Magusis a creator and teaches other creators. The Magus is a preserver; by writingbooks, he or she makes sure that the Word can be continued after his or herlife—until fresh fever comes again from the skies. The Magus is also thedestroyer; he or she ends existing paradigms. Historically in the West, mostMagi founded their own schools. The uniqueness of the Temple of Set is thatsince it is based on individual syntheses of the Left-Hand Path, it can allowfor new Magi who destroy old ideas and also allow for self-aware humans to bringthe new ideas as long as the twin poles of self-creation and awareness of thePrince of Darkness (or at least of the idea of him) continue. The Magus mustteach people to build ladders; it is up to those who learn the craft andepisteme to come up with their own desires to use the ladders. THE MAGNETIZATION The Magus’s coming into being has an effect on the human cosmos. It causesothers to have an immanent experience of the Divine, based on their preexistingmaterial. In other words just as the Magus’s experience has two parts—the long,hard path of their life where they bettered themselves via the principle and themoment of divine revelation—other humans who currently use the principle (eventhough they have not heard of the Word) have the divine experience upon hearingthe Word. People who have never heard of a given Word (such as the current Wordsof the Temple of Set: Xeper, Remanifest, Arkte) are drawn toward the Word;however, since they have been Working with it (albeit on an unknowing level),they have already gained skills and knowledge that they can put to use. TheMagus soon finds his or her army. Setians begin experiencing this in the thirddegree, when the Setians that are drawn to them have similar life issues; thistrains them for the fourth degree. OTHER WORDS The Magus is not alone in his or her utterance. First, the other Words that havehelped him or her in the journey before are connected with the new Word. Theinterconnections that aided in his or her self-creation become a map forteaching the Word to Setians. This may begin with simple writing exercises like“Word X is like and unlike Xeper.” These connections can lead the Magus throughthe first part of his or her utterance, but the Magus needs to be weaned fromthese connections, so that the Word does not exist only in the jargon of theTemple. Likewise as the Magus begins his or her task, other Words may be cominginto being. Runa and Remanifest arrived at the same time, and Robert W.Robinson’s articulation of Essent occurred at the same time I was dealing withmy uttering of Xeper. These Words create opportunities and frictions, synergiesand blockages; Words do not compete or cooperate, but they create instabilitiesthat the magistry must use to take the Temple to a higher level of order. Last,each Word has other concepts that lie just beneath it in the system of ideasthat form the Word. For example, Troth underlies Runa, Demanifestation must bepaired with Remanifestation, and in Crowley’s case the two words in Greek addingup to 93, Love and Will—Agape with Thelema. These concepts have a certain lifeof their own as well. It is not the Temple’s job to make Words succeed. The process that a Word goesthrough in becoming successful or failing to thrive provides much of thematerial that drives its cosmic cycles. A Word that spurs initiates to makechanges in both their subjective and objective universes will call the materialinto being that the Magus can craft into his or her Work. The theater is not adistraction for the initiates who watch; instead it provides hundreds of doorsto self-betterment and the challenge of hundreds of distractions that give theinitiates ways to focus their Will. Words are not for all, as Crowley wouldimply; every Setian need not put any banner on save for Set’s eternal Word.However, the Temple should give its Magi the correct blend of support andreasoned resistance so that Words become strong enough and clear enough that anySetian can understand them as a concept, any adept can use them as a tool, anypriest can see them as a facet of the mind of Set, and any Master can use themto project himself or herself into the cosmos as a fact. Each grade as well asthe past and the yet-to-be is in exchange with the Magus. The Magus’s uniqueexperience of the gift of Set makes him or her a giver. And each Master whofocuses himself or herself though the four steps mentioned above (understanding,using, seeing, projecting) becomes a giver as well. When all the Masters can dothis, the Magus’s relationship with the cosmos is changed. He or she is nolonger in a theater; from now on he or she will see each event in the cosmos asthe dealing of his or her own psyche with himself or herself. He or she nolonger seeks the graal, for he or she will have become the graal, themagnetization that focused on his or her person will be transferred to theTemple as a whole, and his or her Word will sink into the rich loom of Set wecall the Æon of Set. When this occurs the Magus’s concept enters thepreconsciousness of himself or herself, and the Magus has the opposite ofecstasy, the sense of being outside one’s self when the Word was given, butinstead has “enstasy,” the sense of standing within himself or herself. Thatstate we call ipsissimus stands isolate and no longer draws its definition fromthe cosmos because it represents an equilibrium of the transcendent and immanentselves. The path to the state has been one of terrible sanity and sobriety thatoften looked like madness, ecstasy, or suffering to the onlookers in thetheater. "},{"pageContent":"The Grade of Ipsissimus > > Behind your thoughts and feelings, my brother, there stands a mighty ruler, an> unknown stage—whose name is self. FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE There is a great deal of misunderstanding of this grade. If I had a nickel foreveryone who has told me, “That can’t be done!” I could buy a coffee drink atStarbucks. One of the medium-size beverages at least. First, I will talk about the term ipsissimus, and then I will reflect on thefour aspects of the grade: the end of magnetization, the end of the formula ofsacrifice, the nature of overcoming, the tasks of the grade. Ipsissimus is a medieval Latin coinage. In other words the word doesn’t show upin classical Latin, but among the scholars who used it as the common language ofthe learned class. As best I can tell St. Thomas Aquinas created the term forhis book Summa Theologica. It is the superlative form of the word for“sameness,” ipse. For those of you who have forgotten your high school English:the normative form is, for example, red; the comparative form is redder, and thesuperlative form is reddest. St. Thomas might have explained it thus. All thingsthat exist are like their Form. A chair is like the Form of a chair. Now whatthing in the universe is most like its Form? Only one thing can be the MostSame, that would be God. All other things differ from their most perfect Form. This is not to say the normative form (ipse, ipsa, ipsum) does not exist inclassical Latin. Common phrases include “ego ipse,” meaning “my very self.” Orwhen dealing with numbers it can be translated as “exactly.” When used inreferring to action or will, it means “of one’s accord.” It is because of thelater meaning that a certain German philologist revived the word in the latterhalf of the nineteenth century. The term ipsissimus more or less fell out of usage in the Renaissance. A notableexception was English philosopher and author Francis Bacon’s use of it in NovumOrganum as a quality that related what something is with what something does. Ifa thing is what a thing does, it has “ipseity.” This is commonly translated asmeaning “truth and utility are the very same things.” Bacon based a good deal ofhis reasoning regarding the scientific method on his use of this word, and itbegan a strand of philosophy that eventually had its greatest expression in thepragmatism of American philosopher and psychologist William James. In 1878 Nietzsche used the term ipsissimus to describe himself because he hadovercome himself and his world. If a human has come to a place where all of histhoughts and feelings come from the Self in relation to the Self instead of fromthe Self in relation to the cosmos, then one is an Ipsissimus. If you were cooland avant-garde in Britain in the late nineteenth century, you read this guy. Hetook the ideas of Charles Darwin and ran with them. So when William Wescott, oneof three founders of the Golden Dawn, needed authority he created the fiction ofthe German Adept Anna Sprengel in 1887, and she had to be in Germany. Not onlydid the nonexistent Sprengel make the boys (Westcott, Mathers, and Woodman) eachan Adeptus Exemptus, she also used a mixture of trendy titles related to Germanphilosophy, such as Ipsissimus, as well as terms in use in English Rosicruciancircles like Magus and Adeptus. Now Aleister Crowley was attracted to previous Magi of the Will and Werden andThelema: Rabelais for Thelema, Nietzsche for Werden, and Randolph for Will. (Youmight compare the Laws of Randolph with those of Crowley: Love lieth at thefoundation; Will reigns omnipotent.) Crowley also recognized the term ipsissimusas the correct label for someone not bound by the cosmos. The Ipsissimus existsas a pure expression of Will; he is no longer an agent, but a force. On May 23,1921, Crowley took the oath of the grade: to view the universe as an expressionof his soul, that is to say, as God. His remarks about the grade are found inMagick. > He is sworn to accept this Grade in the presence of a witness, and to express> its nature in word and deed, but to withdraw Himself at once within the veils> of his natural manifestation as a man, and to keep silence during his human> life as to the fact of his attainment, even to the other members of the Order.> The Ipsissimus is pre-eminently the Master of all modes of existence; that is,> his being is entirely free from internal and external necessity. His work is> to destroy all tendencies to construct or to cancel such necessities. He is> the Master of the Law of Unsubstantiality (Anatta). The Ipsissimus has no> relation as such with any Being: He has no will in any direction, and no> Consciousness of any kind involving duality, for in Him all is accomplished;> as it is written “beyond the Word and the Fool, yea, beyond the Word and the> Fool.” Crowley’s system, unlike ours, is nondualist and subject to the notion thatpsyche and physis are one and the same. Crowley described that taking the oathled to three years of trial called the grand initiation that killed him as humanbeing. Thus the Golden Dawn numbers of parts divine to parts human for the gradeare 2 = 0. The Golden System based on the metaphor of masonry compared the humanto a rough stone that is polished into a smooth cubical stone. Each stage ofcarving and polishing counted as removing your rough human edges and manifestingyour divine polished surfaces. It is a progress from a natural state (whereinone is subject to natural laws) to an unnatural or Perfected state (wherein onehas become the constant rather than a variable in the equation of the universe).No human left. Since the oath as used in the Thelemic system is a sacred andconcealed mystery, it can only be found on a very few public websites. The Temple possesses a dualist system. We do think that the human being bound intime and space is real, that such an incarnation is a good thing, and that thehuman being bound in time and space is a part of a much greater whole. Thereforewe designate the grade of Ipsissimus as the sixth degree, following Aquino’s“arithmosophy” as outlined in his “Ceremony of the Nine Angles.” The Temple hadoriginally titled the grade as “rex,” referring to a certain symbolism known andunderstood by the Masters of the Temple and reflecting the Setian theory ofmagick. In the Indian Left-Hand Path, the grade is called “siddha.” Let’s look at some of the hallmarks of the grade. THE END OF MAGNETIZATION Humans build their minds by interacting with other minds. On a divine level thispractice was part of Set’s coming into being, He had to create HarWer. Since ourcoming into being must of necessity reflect Set’s, we too need others. On ahuman level, Harvard psychologist Stephen Kosslyn has suggested, “Your mind maynot arise simply from your own brain but from the brains of other people.” Hedescribes this process as involving “social prosthetic systems.” He says we relyon others to “extend our reasoning abilities and help us regulate andconstructively employ our emotions.” Because of this need we summon the higherman, whose presence gives us the shock to awaken, and we summon people justbehind us on the path, so that we can strengthen our ideas by teaching them. TheIpsissimus no longer has this need, so the world is not full of students whohave something to teach us as we teach them. Unless the Ipsissimus callsspecifically—for example, Ipsissimus Aquino when founding the Order of theTrapezoid—the Ipsissimus’s life is not regulated by those whom she or he meets. THE END OF THE FORMULA OF SACRIFICE There is only one true sacrifice. We can give our lower (less perfect, lesspermanent) Self to our higher (more permanent, more perfect) Self. The nonsenseof sacrificing animals is human egotism at its worst. I can’t give the life of abunny to a god. I don’t own the life of the bunny. Such atrocities actuallyfurther the gap between the human and the divine. Odin’s formula of giving selfto Self (sjálfr sjálfum mér) works through the first five grades. The loss ofself-involvement—the giving up of self-delusions, received opinions, pettiness,and so on—makes the manifest Self a better tool for the greater Self. For theIpsissimus the manifest Self has become a perfect mirror in space-time to thegreater Self. In other words the Ipsissimus can’t push real hard to makesomething work. The way that initiation has taught him or her—that if one reallyfocuses a better result can be had—is lost. This is disorienting to theIpsissimus. On the one hand his or her most perfected Self is accessible all ofthe time; on the other hand this doesn’t stop the Ipsissimus from being a sloppyjerk. The Ipsissimus is not different because she or he is in the ritual chamberversus unplugging a toilet. The method of action for Ipsissimi is wu wei—theTaoist concept or nonbeing, or that by doing whatever comes to them, they willachieve results that are harmonious with their Will. This actually makes lifemore mysterious to them. Unlike the moments in their past, when they mightassume that any odd or unpleasant situation they found themselves in was a signthat they needed to learn something, now the vicissitudes of life are methods bywhich their greater Self is achieving its goals. When I was a new adept, I hadto represent the Temple at a law enforcement seminar that Aquino had suddenlybeen unable to attend due to a pinched nerve. When I reported on the event(which had scared me to death), Aquino remarked that he thought that Set musthave pinched the nerve on his back. At the time I thought this was a sillyreligious remark. Now I understand it. THE NATURE OF OVERCOMING Nietzsche defined the Ipsissimus in terms of what he or she had overcome. TheIpsissimus has passed through the reordering of the Self based on a principle.He or she has overcome both the manifest Self and the æon. When he or she was aMagus all perception had to be filtered through a single idea. This causes theidea to expand beyond the mind of the Magus and live in the minds of people whoare transformed by the idea. This change has surrounded the Ipsissimus so thatall things around him or her bear his or her mark. In other words we know thatmagick is the art of changing the subjective universe so that a change willoccur in the objective universe. The Ipsissimus lives in an objective universewherein the greatest change has occurred. He or she has bought into being aprinciple that now acts in the world without his or her intervention. This meansthat on a deep level the psyches of everyone around the Ipsissimus are workinghis or her magick. A Magus is not “successful” because everyone agrees with hisor her Word. A Magus is successful when no one can think of the idea and notthink of the Magus’s articulation of it. One may not agree with anything Freudsays, but one can’t think about psychoanalysis without thinking of his theories.The original drama that surrounded the Magus, the theater of the Word, is nowenacted by humans whether the Magus is present or not. The Word will live in theworld and will either summon new mouths or die away. The changes going on in theworld have been programmed by the psyche of the Ipsissimus; all that isNot-Self, or Anatta, reflects the organizing principle of the Self. The Selfthat determines all thoughts and emotions is also determining all phenomena thatthe Ipsissimus perceives. This is not solipsism; the Ipsissimus by no meansthinks he or she creates or controls all that he or she sees; instead the humanquest for meaning, which we call initiation, has ended. The Ipsissimus lives ina universe ordered by his psyche for his or her perception. THE TASKS OF THE GRADE Humans exist to act. “Be-ing” means “do-ing.” The Ipsissimus is an adjuster ofenergy flow. Since he or she perceives the universe in an ordered fashion, he orshe is motivated by a desire to optimize and harmonize the mesocosmos in whichhe or she dwells. One cannot and should not try to do Work for others. You can’tgive gnosis to others. But the Ipsissimus’s Self is fed by the creation ofgnosis by his or her chosen clan, temple, affinity group, and so on. Because hisor psyche has expanded its perceptions into a chosen group of elect, his or herpsyche has become involved in the creation of a group-derived gnosis, known inthe Indian Left-Hand Path by the Sanskrit word kaulajñana. The Ipsissimusmaintains his or her state by encouraging dialogue and discovery in themesocosmos where his or her idea has come to live. Likewise the Ipsissimus seeksto add energy to this mesocosmos by placing it in a greater area of discourse;in other words to connect the æon to other æons, modes of thought, or realitytunnels. If the Ipsissimus fails to increase the creation of a group-derivedgnosis, the task will be a failure. We have all seen this in history: a Magus,having been successful with his or her Word, sets himself or herself up as thebe-all and end-all of his little group and cuts off growth within the group andinteraction with the greater world. In many ways the later magickal career ofAnton LaVey would be an example of this failure. If the Ipsissimus succeeds withhis or her task, the idea of the group and the power of its gnosis will radiateoutward into the greater human sphere. Notably, the power of such “leakages” canovercome amazing obstacles. One might consider how the Greek Magical Papyri orthe Eddas survived to the modern times, given the thin ice of monotheism thattried to eradicate them. The Work of a successful Ipsissimus—the group-derivedgnosis—can be summoned by the magnetization of Workers in the yet-to-be. Becauseof the eternal Word of Set, which reflects human being and becoming and therelationship of the products of that becoming Xepera Xeper Xeperu, the Templehas the power to summon such gnosis or kaulajñana to us as tools. Thisrelationship began when LaVey told his grotto leaders to research existingmagicks and mythologies to “spice up” his groups’ Workings. It grew in a hugeway when the Temple and Aquino summoned Stephen Edred Flowers to it and wepicked the methodology of Runa, and an even stronger form of this receptivemagick is on the horizon. "},{"pageContent":"The Stele of Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu Let’s examine the Stele of Revealing as a magickal device. I will givetranslations of the inscriptions on the stele using the terms currently used inmodern Egyptology, which have changed some notions of pronunciation since thepopular books Crowley used more than a century ago, and then comment on them. Ona magickal level Crowley’s metanarrative reconsecrates the funerary talismaninto a preutterance of Thelema. If I tell a story to explain a story, it is ametanarrative; for example, if I say, “Before I tell you how I met my wife, youmust first understand that she was an archaeologist working in Siberia diggingup Sarmatians.” I will have created a story that gives context to the story I amtelling. Magickians use this method much in the manner Christian groups usereadings from the Bible to explain the context of a sermon. To understand athing, you must know its roots and cultivate and eat of its fruits. This bookmay help you with the first stage and hopefully spur you on to your own seeking.The later stage is up to you, but remember, a Word is understood through doing,through action research, not by contemplation. The stele has altered versions of three spells from The Book of Coming Forth byDay. The Book of Coming Forth by Day (otherwise known as the Egyptian Book ofthe Dead) is one of the many books that contained spells to aid the dead in theduat. On the front of the stele Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu is presenting “thousands” ofbreads, beers, cattle, and fowl to Re-Horus, whose name Crowley writes asRe-Horkate, Ra-Hoor-Khuit, and so forth, of the Two Horizons. Behind the god isthe symbol for the western lands (i.e., the place of the dead). Re-Horus in thefarworld lives in the field of rushes, where the dead go to be purified. Abovehim is the winged disk of Horus of Behdety, the martial and protective form ofthe Elder Horus, who rules over a section of the farworld. Encircling all isNuit. On the winter solstice the Milky Way appears to be a woman arched over thesky, positioned so that she swallows the sun in the West and gives birth to himin the East. Hence her title of the sow who eats her piglets. Beneath the offering scene is written: > Words to be said by this deadman, Priest of Montu, the Lord of Thebes, opener> of the shrine at Karnak. Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu, True of voice, “O exalted one!> Great of Remanifestations, the great Ba whom the gods fear, who appears on his> great Throne—Make the path for my Ba, Akh, and Shadow, for I am equipped that> I might shine on that path as an Akh. Make for me the path of Re, Atum,> Khephra, and Hathor.” Says this deadman, Priest of Montu, the Lord of Thebes,> Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu, true of voice, son of Bes-na-Maut, who had the same titles> and his wife Singer of Amun-Re, Lady of the House, Ta-Nech. Egyptian temples were like playgrounds for the gods. As beloved as Barbies, theidols of the gods were dressed, fed, washed, taken on little strolls, and closedup safe at night. These activities were hidden from profane eyes.Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu was the son of two working officials. His dad, Bes-na-Maut,had the same job as Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu; he was a stolist. A stolist dresses thegod every morning and undresses it at night. These guys likewise put the god inhis shrine at night and took him out in the morning. His mom was a semet. Herjob was to sing and shake her sistrum in honor of the supreme god of theEgyptian state, Amun-Re. This means both of his parents labored in the biggesttemple complex in Egypt, spent most of their time there, and got their jobs fromtheir parents, who got their jobs from their parents, and so on. We are toldthat Ta-Nech is either his mom’s name or, more likely, her title: “thehairdresser.” She was of high rank to get the wifely title of nebthys per, “ladyof the house.” Frankly, the family had some bucks as well as a life thatremained in sacred time all the time. Compare this to Crowley’s dad. He was apreacher among the exclusionist Plymouth Brethren who tried to spend as manyhours as possible among his flock, and Crowley’s mother was harsh and bitter. Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu’s father’s name, translated as Bes of Mut, can mean eitherliterally some form of the dwarf god Bes, identified with the popular Thebangoddess Mut, the vulture mother, or it (more likely) reads as “Initiated ofMut.” The version of spell 95 from The Book of Coming Forth by Day deserves somecomment. The spell grants two things: it turns you into an akh (an effective andequipped shining spirit, an astral being), and it makes sure that as a dead manyou are mobile. You cannot be trapped in any doorway in the farworld. The usualversion of the spell opens the way for the akh (Crowley’s khu) only; thisversion opens the way for the akh, ba, and sheut (or shadow). I’ve mentionedEgyptian soul-terms earlier, but I wish to add a few observations in regards tothis formula. The ba is that part of yourself that grows and changes over time.After death it usually achieves union with the unchangeable or idealized versionof yourself, the ka, and becomes the akh. However, Ankh-efen-Khonsu wanted hispersonality to remain; he even makes a pitch to Re-Horus of the Two Horizons,saying what a great Ba that god has. This spell asks for personal immortality.Even more interesting is the sheut, or shadow. The Sheut gives a person physicalmobility and also the power to fuck. Generally it dies when you do. However, asthe inner circle of the Golden Dawn knew from the Taoist classic Secret of theGolden Flower, such things have a use. In Secret of the Golden Flower, theinitiate is told a secret about the lower animal or yin soul (po) and thehigher, luminous, or yang soul (hun). Normally the hun survives death, and thepo rots (or becomes one of those funky, jumping vampires in Hong Kong movies).But if you really like yourself, here is the twofold secret: the po can makeenergy for the hun, and the hun can remake the po. In other words desire can begood. (The Buddhists can leave the room now.) When you want to steal Mary Ann’sDiet Coke from the company refrigerator, you are dealing with energy. But itisn’t just a matter of sublimating your evil wishes; the extra power you putinto the hun should be shined back through the po to create a unified self. Thenyou can become a Taoist immortal. Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu knew a similar secret, so hehad spell 95 from The Book of Coming Forth by Day rewritten to include materialfrom a later spell (spell 150). Egyptians had no problem in personalizing aliturgy, or using words from very different time periods. The Book of ComingForth by Day had been around for a thousand years before Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu.Imagine a modern American Christian saying, “I like this part from the Lord’sPrayer, and this passage in Huckleberry Finn, because they fit me better.”Religion is about the fixed text, magick is about the text that reflects theWill of the magickian. This process did not begin with Crowley, he merely helpedrevive it. He is making a perpetual deal; the god gets beer, bread, fowl, and cattle and asgod of the field of rushes purifies the three souls—shining, worldly, anddark—so that they are not trapped in any doorway. Liminality was important toAnkh-ef-en-Khonsu; not only was his job opening the doors of the shrine, but healso wanted power over doorways for all time—for his best and worst parts. Thepath that is opened is the sun’s orbit: Khephra in the morning, Re at noon, Atumin the evening, and the body of the celestial cow Hathor at night. He isspeaking in accordance with what he knows of the order of the cosmos, ma’atkheru, or “justified of voice.” The Egyptian afterlife system was a gnostic one;if you knew the secrets of the cosmos, you had power over it, not it over you.As a priest and the son of a priest, Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu knew the secrets of thefarworld; he had practiced the journey to the West practically every day of hislife. On the back of the stele two other spells from The Book of Coming Forth by Dayare combined. The first is the most powerful and common spell in Egypt, spell30b, which keeps one’s heartmind (ib) from betraying one in the farworld. Thesecond part is from spell 2, which enables the dead man to have full access toboth the farworld and the world of the living. I will give a translation of thetext and then offer some commentary: > Words to be said by this deadman, Priest of Montu, the Lord of Thebes,> Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu, True of voice, “O heartmind of my mother! O heartmind of my> mother! O heartmind that existed while I lived upon earth, do not stand> against me as a witness, do not oppose me in the tribunal, do not be hostile> against me in the presence of the Great God, Lord of the West. Although I have> joined the land to the great western side of Heaven, may I flourish upon> earth!” Words spoken by this deadman, the Stolist of Thebes,> Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu, True of Voice, “O Great of Arm, who shines like the moon,> the Osiris, Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu, goes forth from your multitudes. You who are> the deliverer of those who are within the sun-light, open for him the Farworld> indeed, the Osiris, Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu who goes forth by day in order to do> everything all that he desires upon earth among the living.” As European thinkers we divide emotions and thought. The Egyptians thought thesewere one phenomena ruled by a metaphysical organ called the ib. This was similarto but not the same as the physical heart, just as we perceive a differencebetween the brain and the mind. Its quality is pumping thoughts and emotionsaround between the parts of the soul-body complex. After death it stops servingthe average human; the average guy goes to the hall of judgment, and the ibtells all. The initiate masters his or her heart in spell 30; 30 is the Egyptiannumber of rebirth, the Heb-Sed. On a personal level this spell is about owningone’s life story. Take the event that you have done that looks the worst—forexample, stealing money from your grandmother to pay for your heroin habit. Ifyou can tell me the story, truthfully, that this shocked you into kicking thedrug and becoming a good human, then you own your story. You turned your evilsinto good, and it would be a different story from just the facts. Spell 30 isnot about lying; you cannot lie to Osiris in the judgment hall. Note that theGolden Dawn initiation is based on their understanding of the scene of judgmentfrom The Book of Coming Forth by Day. The god Iah is addressed in spell 2. Iahwas a moon god who was popular in early times and later largely becameidentified with Khonsu. He is unique in being considered the shepherd of themultitudes—all of the khabs or stars. The usual spell does not address Iah asthe savior of all those who are in sunlight; later cults associate him somewhatwith the Akkadian god Sin, and this epithet may refer to certain non-Egyptian(Harran) beliefs. As far as his ability to grant passage to the living world forthose who invoke him, you’re reading this aren’t you? Crowley was doing both theWill of Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu and incorporating that Will into his own by use ofmetanarrative. The use of metanarrative is well established in the occult world(think of Rosicrucian groups claiming famous past members) as well as inpolitics. The wise Thelemite knows that both of these fields are the same. "},{"pageContent":"Thelema and Xeper People who use the Thelemic system often use a calendar based on the majorarcana, the tarot trumps. The cycles of 22 are based on the number of trumps inthe tarot deck. Crowley thought this was a good guide to the seasons of thesoul, which are named by the card of the cycle and then by the card of the year.Thus, the second 22 years (beginning in 1927) were ruled by the Magus, the next22 by the High Priestess, and so on. The formula for converting the date of thecommon calendar is (common date: 1904) ÷ 22. Thus the year 2011 would be 2011 −1904 = 107 ÷ 22 = IVXIX. The IV refers to the fourth trump, the number of thecycle, the subscripted XIX refers to the year of the season. The cycle is ruledby the Emperor, the year by the Sun. Each season shows the influence of thecycle card (in this case the Emperor) and the year card (here the Sun). Let’s look at a few dates under this system. The year 1966 would be of the cycleof the High Priestess and ruled by the moon. Pure, exalted, and graciousinfluences entered the world in a time of duality and fluctuation marked by thecycle of the moon—the symbol both of illusion and sorcery; in Crowley’s words“the darkest hour before the dawn” ruled the year. In 1966 Anton LaVey, a SanFrancisco–based sorcerer who grew up as Howard S. Levey, founded the Church ofSatan and uttered the Word Indulgence—a Word strongly ruled (for both good andill) by the moon. In Setian cosmology this marked an age of union between Horusand Set. Indulgence is a moonstruck Word; choosing personal pleasure as a guideto action, the Word crystallized the sixties approach to love and “if it feelsright, do it!” LaVey had visited the Agape Lodge, which he referred to as theChurch of Thelema. A book collector, he had a first-run set of The Equinox andadopted certain Thelemic practices: the woman from the Gnostic Mass became theChurch of Satan’s infamous “naked altar.” The princes of hell from the AbramelinWorking were a favorite of both the Golden Dawn and Crowley. They remanifestedin the Church of Satan’s magickal anthropology: Belial for sovereignty,Leviathan for magickal power, Satan for lust, and Lucifer for reason. The“powerhouse” for Church of Satan Workings were the Enochian keys, which were“Satanized” by LaVey. LaVey threw out the symbol maps like Crowley’s 777 (seepage 16) and replaced them with aesthetic and emotional guidelines. It does notmatter if I am drawing the correct sigil for Mars; it matters if I canmanipulate my emotions in a sufficiently martial way. This practicality led theway for the chaos movement of the 1980s. LaVey took historical note of Crowley’stalent at self-promotion, as well as Gerald Gardner’s, founder of modern Wicca,who knew a mix of respectable and outrageous will attract folks who are bothadventurous and dedicated. He made the Church of Satan a household word by the1970s, even blessing Johnny Carson on The Tonight Show. The lunar powers of thechurch’s inception proved too great a temptation for LaVey, who allowed it tobecome more and more a personal vehicle, but the lunar notion of making theworld into one’s “transformatrix” was established. Tantra uses feminine energyfor the benefit of a male magickian, wherein the woman is ultimately a vessel,whereas indulgence is the process of male and female magickians making theirlair, their mesocosmos, into the vessel of which they are both the primarymaterial and the directors of the operation. Although in his personal life LaVeywas a misogynist, his system can be empowering in some respects to both men andwomen. San Francisco, which had seen the first mail-order occult group based onWill, the Brotherhood of Eulis (established in 1875), and had been thebirthplace of American tantra and the city where Aleister Crowley first publiclyproclaimed himself a Magus (in 1915, in the Rose and Thistle pub in SanFranscisco), also became the home of the Church of Satan. In 1970 a new cycle started with the Empress ruling the show. As to be expectedthis moment of uniting love and Will brought great success to the Æon of Horus.Grady McMurtry, an American student of Crowley, devoted a good part of his lifeto reenergize the OTO—making it a large, international, and visibleorganization. By determined effort and through the magickal act of makingCrowley’s tarot widely available, the number of people interested in andinfluenced by Crowley grew quickly. The end of the last cycle, in 1969, hadbrought Aquino to the Church of Satan and Crowley to the cover of Sgt. Pepper’sLonely Hearts Club Band. McMurtry’s method of giving access to the psyche(especially via the tarot) fit the æonic bill perfectly. The Empress, with herunion of love and Will, ruled over a time of expansion, both outwardly andinwardly, and the small OTO grew rapidly. Fortune favors the bold. The cycle of the Empress brought Thelema into mainstream thinking. In 1971 JohnSymond’s influential biography, The Beast 666: The Life of Aleister Crowley, waspublished; 1972 saw Kenneth Grant’s somewhat inventive occult history, TheMagical Revival; and so on. Just as McMurtry’s Work was empowering the seekerwith knowledge of the worlds within and without, Grant began putting forth agospel of becoming open to influences beyond the conventional world. Grant beganpopularizing (with more enthusiasm than fact) the notion of an interrelationshipbetween magickal Workings and cultural trends. The idea of a participatorymesocosmos began filtering into the occult world at this time. The year 1974, ofthe cycle of the empress and ruled by the emperor, had two notable events. As tobe expected the emperor, who is symbolized by Tzaddi, the fishhook, put twomajor hooks in the world, separated by space and appearing unknown to eachother. Nema, a disciple of Kenneth Grant, received Liber Pennae Praenumbra, abook from the conjoined Horus-Set entity. She created a magickal system based onthe Word IPSOS, “themselves,” which speaks of the moment of union between theprinciples of Set (isolated intelligence) and Horus (coordinated action ortelos). Grant equated this Word with part of The Book of the Law cipher (R P S TO V A L; see verse II-76 on page 56); by gematria both are equal to 696 (if the“S” is the Hebrew letter shin). Nema’s work had an influence on a strong sectionof the Thelemic world as well as such popular occult writers as Donald MichaelKraig. A more mysterious event was to happen in central Texas. Stephen EdredFlowers, a student at the University of Texas in Austin, had joined hisgirlfriend and her coven leader in a wild goose chase. The coven leader hadrecently met “Norbu Chen” (Charles Vernon Alexander II). Chen had taken up therole of a “Tibetan” healer in 1972. The coven mistress was sure that she andChen had a link in an earlier life. She convinced Flowers and his girlfriend toride to Chen’s home in a Houston oil-field. The great lama answered the door ofhis trailer with a beer in one hand and ordered them to take a hike. On therather quiet ride home to Austin, Flowers drifted in and out of sleep until heheard a single Word, Runa. Flowers spent fifteen years refining his sense ofthis Word, which means “the mysteries.” The Temple of Set recognized him as aMagus of this Word on July 13, 1989, and the world has also recognized theinfluence of this Word in many ways, such as the existence of the Rune-Gild,Rûna-Raven Press, and the Woodharrow Institute. Flowers had promulgated his Lawas reyn til runa, which is old Norse for “seek the mysteries.” Although he hadused and taught the phrase for years, it was not until 1993 that he noticed thatthe phrase, when written in the runes of the Younger Futhark, the alphabet forold Norse, added to 93 by rune tally. An important formula for finding one’sTrue Will was revealed, as noted in verse II-27. In the year 1975, the Church of Satan was at its most moonstruck. The notion ofinitiation as anything belonging to the Self as opposed to the pocketbookvanished from Anton LaVey’s thinking. Michael Aquino, who had devoted his timein the church to creating an initiatory path, strongly disagreed with the notionthat one’s ability to contribute to LaVey’s finances was the sign of election.He sought to create a new organization that would strengthen the notions ofinitiation and community and explore self-development. He appreciated LaVey’sapproach to magick but had come to believe in the existence of the human psyche.How could you create a religion that remained, in Nietzsche’s phrase, “faithfulto the Earth,” meaning based on real world, this-lifetime improvement, yet alsofulfilled the psyche’s need for immortality? Philosophically, Aquino had brokenwith the Right-Hand Path, which stresses that the psyche should harmonize itscontents with the universe by eliminating desire. He took the notion of thereal-world, this-lifetime goals as the method of training the psyche. Thephilosophical work done, he invoked the Prince of Darkness, who did not show upas LaVey’s Satan, the moonstruck side of Thelema, but as the ancient Egyptiangod Set. Set entrusted Aquino with the Egyptian verb xeper. In 1975 the year wasruled by the hierophant, and the unity of love and Will was placed in the handsof the demonic initiator—a figure connected with bull gods and the Age ofTaurus. On the north solstice of that year, Set shined forth at night, revealingto Aquino The Book of Coming Forth by Night, and Set, the bull of Ombos,returned to the world, asking that his nobles be brought to him. The great godthat had seeded Egyptian civilization at Naqada during the Age of Taurus hadreturned. Let’s look at the Word Xeper. We have seen its relationship with Thelema and howthat Word generated the matrix that produced Xeper. I will consider the WordXeper and then I will compare and contrast it with Thelema. Aquino had firstencountered the Word in E. A. Wallis Budge’s Easy Lessons in EgyptianHieroglyphics. One of the first papyri that Budge had learned to translate atthe British Museum contained a spell that allowed people after death to havepower over living creatures and knowledge of the actions of the sun; in otherwords, it allowed for a death that had both power in the real world andpotential for knowing the secrets of the cosmos in the next world. The papyrushad been hidden in Dayr-al-Bahiri, not far from the resting place of the Steleof Revealing. The idea of Xeper is very old in Egyptian religion. The scarabbeetle (Khepai) lays its eggs in dung, dead animals, and even other scarabs; tothe Egyptians it seemed that it brought forth its young from dead matter. It wasa symbol of self-creation. This reflects the human psyche that brings itselfforth from the confluence of biology and social conventions. It discovers itselfwhen it rebels against these conventions. The human is born trapped in language.Even before he or she arrives, there has been talk, names have been picked out,and expectations have been drawn. The young human forgets his or her psyche asit conforms to the word game already created for it. Yet the Setian postulatesthat human experience shows an outside influence. The young human is tempted torebel and choose his or her own “Wyrd.” The Setian sees this as the action of atranscendent Self (ka) that initiates the Self using whatever books, films,experiences, people, and other tools are at hand. The young human discovers thisimpulse to be more than a machine, and to the extent that he or she follows thisimpulse can create himself or herself. We call this process Xeper (pronounced“kheffer” with the vowels assumed—more recent breakthroughs in Egyptologysuggest they might have said “Cupfurr”—which matches Crowley’s “Coph”). Humans who are attracted to this process are drawn magickally to places,experiences, and people that can provide the best material for the transcendentSelf to Work on and with the imminent Self (ba). Just as Egyptian theology sawthe process of becoming an “effective spirit” as the union of the ba and the kainto the akh (Crowley’s khu), Setians neither worship their ka more nor valuetheir day-to-day experiences as more important in their process. This blendfulfills a commitment to this world and this life and the quest for immortality.I followed in Michael Aquino’s footsteps and reuttered the Word of Xeper. I wasnot the first, nor shall I be the last. In 1993 while reading a book on Egyptian grammar, Set’s eternal Word revealeditself to me. This was not supposed to happen. I had read Crowley’s theory thatclassified Magi as two types. One started æons; the other rose to the Will ofthe grade to maintain the æon. In the Temple we didn’t look for the second kind,and I was not looking to be one. I had received a book from Set two years beforethat commanded that I revitalize the æon by leading a Heb-Sed rite. I didn’tunderstand that I would have to become either a high priest or a Magus. I was not the first to utter Xeper. According to our mythology the first wasMehen-Pet-Tha; Set mentions him in The Book of Coming Forth by Night. I hadreally looked for that name in writings about New Kingdom times for two reasons:the board game of Horus and Set called Mehen was popular then. The Xepera XeperXeperu formula is too old grammatically speaking for the New Kingdom, but it wasknown then, as seen in an inscription on the idol of Ramses III, the son ofSetnakt. I never could find the name. Then in 2011 I stumbled across the name ofa princess of the Second Dynasty. There she was: Mehen-Pet-Tha, or “Mehen WhoKindles Celestial Fire.” She seems to have been the son of Peribsen, the onlypharaoh to call himself a “Living Set” rather than a “Living Horus.” This wouldbe the right time for the archaic grammar. As a princess, he would have been ahigh priest. All we have left of her is a scarab bearing his name.*6[CR%21XKH88GDSZ52D3DFGXSBK3FPMAAQE_split_022.html#filepos912560] Michael Aquino, my teacher’s teacher, had likewise received the Word from anEgyptian grammar book, which created the odd spelling ofchi-epsilon-phi-epsilon-rho, which in English typeface looks like “XEPER.” (Bythe way that would be 670 in Greek, equal to 670 in Hebrew, or “evil,” “mark ofthe serpent,” “creatures of magick,” or “the secret of Hermes.” My teacher’steacher’s coming into being had established my coming into being. I would like to talk about a few aspects of Xeper. I wish to talk about thenature and purpose of Xeper. I would like to discuss a couple of the greaterblack magickal sacraments of Xeper, and I would like to discuss seven causes ofXeper—Baw s.xeperu (causes of Xeper). This discussion is not about creating atypology for typology’s sake; hopefully no one will be saying, “I think that wasmore a Xeper of perception than a Xeper of the group.” I hope this book willhelp you to be more aware of your Xeper, as well as your Thelema, and thereforemore precise in planning and experiencing it. The nature and purpose of Xeper is hidden in the myth of the contendings of Setand Horus. In the Temple there are two views of Xeper. One is the Nietzschianview that Xeper is the process of becoming who you are. That is to say, becomingreflects being. The second view is that Xeper is free willed; you can becomeanything you want to. Neither of these ideas is actually exclusive. Let’s seewhy. The Temple is a dualist system. We conceive of the realms of psyche andphysis as two separate realms. We conceive of the realm of the psyche as beingtimeless. Early in our initiation we may be confused into thinking that thethoughts in our head are part of the realm of the psyche. Yet consider theobjections to this idea. Do you think that if your body decays and you, forexample, have Alzheimer’s that your psyche is fading away? If you take in a fewcups of coffee, a few shots of bourbon, or a couple of thousand micrograms ofLSD, has your psyche changed? Thoughts are the by-products of the brain. They are not what immortality isbased on; thoughts have little of permanence. You would be better off basingyour immortality on the body, which has some permanence. Research shows that ifyou apply a negative stimulus—say dropping hot wax on your arm—your arm beginsto jerk away 0.8 seconds before your brain begins to “decide” to move your arm.Although the “grand illusion of consciousness,” as neurophysiologists call it,produces a narrative of the brain being in charge, all research shows that yourbrain follows the body. Thoughts are not an expression of the psyche; they are a mirror of it. Thepsyche uses your mind to perceive itself. The psyche desires to discover what itis. Thoughts are the process that creates the mirror. The psyche does not act;it comes into being by observing the actions of your manifest Self. Some ofthese actions have the effect of causing the psyche to be aware of itself. Yourlife in the manifest world provides your psyche with the narrative and magickalspell of its creation. The psyche expresses itself here to perfect its Self. Inour life we are bound by a feeling of “I am-ness” wherein the psyche comes tobelieve that it is inside of us, rather like a ghost caught in some meat. Thepractice of philosophy can lead one to the rational position that the life ofyour aging is not “you,” but the psyche has to learn to perceive itself. It didnot manifest here for pleasure, saying, “I’m going to pretend I’m a human andenjoy the show.” It manifested here to self-create contents that are actualizedand ordered in a new way. This process in which the manifest Self can become a better agent for the psycheis called Xeper. As the manifest Self becomes a better agent for the psyche, thepsyche reorders, evolves, and expands itself. The ability to reproduce the Self,the seed of Set, was stolen by HarWer, and the ability to see was stolen by Set.Some of these processes of Xeper are available to all human beings, but many arefully accessible only to the elect. We will look at these processes. First, welook at the sacraments of Xeper. In our lives we experiment with truth by magickal processes. We bless someactivities and people, and we curse others. We illuminate certain processes byenacting them, and we beckon certain experiences to us. For the most part wecall magick to our lives. However, we enact greater rites than we can contrivein the chamber. When we find love, we transform ourselves a million more timesmore powerfully than when we do a love spell in the chamber. At rare times weare able to do this fully by Will, and we call these moments greater blackmagick. These great changes in our outer life transform the soul, and they arethe real sacraments of the soul. The sacraments your soul desires are differentthan those my soul desires. Hence the only true religion is the Left-Hand-Pathsynthesis that lets each soul find its own way. There are two sorts ofsacraments that are common to Setian practice. One of these is recognition; theother is reintegration. Let’s look at these. When I am speaking of “recognition,” I am not merely speaking of the Templeprocess. The psyche desires that the manifest Self undergo certain experiencesand think certain thoughts at the right time for it to perceive itself. Sincethe psyche by its nature is free and unique, at first glance one might assumethat the manifest Self has no need of others. However, it is precisely theability of others to recognize the manifestation of the psyche that draws us toexperiences and groups that can transform us. We have a need to find otherpsyches more advanced than ours to guide us through certain experiences and giveus feedback of our mastery. The psyche can only ethically submit itself to theauthority of a guide or an initiator. The psyche hungers for recognition of atrue authority. As we seek Xeper, we seek stronger and better authorities. Forexample you may begin writing your poetry for yourself, then for your friends,then seek publication, and eventually aim for the Pulitzer Prize. Recognition isa sacrament for the psyche; it allows the psyche to see its virtues mirrored.The form it needs at a given moment can be anything from applause at yourbowling alley for that perfect game or a Nobel Prize in physics. It is thenature of such signs that your psyche can alone be the judge of their power; onehuman’s success may be a boring distraction to others. The need for therecognition as a sacrament of Xeper puts the Setian in the world, as opposed tothe path of contemplation. Although we are a psyche-centric religion, we createa growing desire in our adherent to do more in the world. The second common sacrament is reintegration. Setians use French ethnographerand folklorist Arnold van Gennep’s model of isolation, liminality, andreintegration for rites of passage. First, we withdraw from the world, eithermentally, emotionally, physically, or psychically, to prepare for change. Thisis a moment of reuniting with the black flame, the dynamic force that createsindividuals, Set’s gift. Then we put ourselves into the strange place of betwixtand between, where change can occur. This is called liminality. Last, we returnto the world and renter into its affairs at a higher or more perfected level ofbeing. This is called reintegration. When the psyche can experience itstransformation by experiencing the new mastery of the manifest Self, the psychenot only undergoes Xeper but also creates a link to the world through its newmastery. In other words, let’s say Setian Filbert stepped away to work onhimself for a few weeks, and the night after his transformation, when he seesthat he no longer gets mad at his girlfriend or that he has learned how to riseabove petty politics at work, that is a sacramental moment. “I am different. Ihave become more permanent, more perfected. I have come into being.” By the sacraments of Xeper—both the external one of recognition and the internalone of reintegration—the self in the time-bound objective universe hascontributed to the objectifying of the ultimate subject or, put another way,aided the evolution and self-ordering of the psyche. Now that we understand someof the rites of the secret religion that is yours and yours alone, let’s examinethe types of Xeper and how these types change through the career of an initiate.The first sort, Xeper of necessity, is open to all humans, and it is by thisform of Xeper that most heroes, geniuses, and good humans come into being. Thesecond type, Xeper of the group, is available to some humans and explains howreligious and philosophical organizations help some people. The third type,Xeper of initiation, is available only to humans who have exceptionalcircumstances. The last types are available only to humans who have beguncertain processes at the right moment of their lives: Xeper of perception, Xeperof ipseity, and Xeper of return. Running alongside these processes is a seventhtype, the Xeper of teaching. Let’s examine each of these in turn and concludewith some observations on why Set has made his bond with us through the Word ofXeper, given to Mehen-Pet-Tha. XEPER OF NECESSITY We have all seen this, and we have all done this. There are times in our liveswhen we have to mature faster than would be optimal. We transcend our naturalpatterns because of need. This can happen when a child has to raise his drunkenparents in a reversal of roles, or a green soldier finds himself commanding hisplatoon after a grenade took Sarge. Any time a human has to exceed his or hercurrent biological and social programming, Xeper occurs; the psyche sees itselfin the actions of the challenged human. The manifest Self has to draw on theunmanifested virtues of the psyche. Most humans experience this as a loss ofinnocence and unexamined joy. The kid doesn’t want to be the parent, the soldierdoesn’t want to be in charge, and the disease victim doesn’t relish having toprepare for his or her demise. Most folk religion is about creating the illusionthat such a moment of Xeper has not occurred and that it would be possible toreturn to the Edenic state before the individuation occurs. Most humansexperience this Xeper in their lives. XEPER OF THE GROUP All human groups provide a mixture of friction and support, whether it is afamily group or a Masonic lodge or a softball league. Each group provides theopportunity for the human to exercise his or her reasoning abilities and toregulate and constructively employ his or her emotions. It may even providecertain daemonic or magickal activities, such as a pep rally, baptism, orfraternity initiation. Groups have a certain level of gnosis that is partaken ofby their members. This can include exposing humans to a more advanced human (theshock of meeting the higher man) or access to certain transformative principlesthat the group has. The human who is exposed to this will gain Xeper, dependingon the human’s level of desire and the group’s level of gnosis. The dynamics ofthe group will cause certain humans to unite this level of gnosis with the Xeperof necessity to create leaders. The Freemasons excel at this blending. XEPER OF INITIATION If humans have had any clear moment of Xeper, they have a choice. If the loss ofinnocence or the sense of being sundered from a primal unity bothers them toomuch, they will avoid Xeper, and frankly the desire to avoid Xeper is the one ofthe strongest motivations of human activity. Most people flee activities thatdifferentiate them. If they are drawn to these activities because of the poweror pleasure that they bring, they will create groups. However, some humans finda desire for Xeper. The relationship between the mirror of life and the pushcartis a loving one. These humans begin to seek experiences to bring about Xeper.They become initiates and initiate such deeds that can lead them to the momentof Xeper. This can be the human who confronts his fear of heights by skydiving,or the human who decides she will take a painting class. Some humans go very farwith one type of such activity, such as becoming a stuntman or studying apeslike Jane Goodall. In healthy societies such people are valorized; in unhealthysocieties such individuals are derided as freaks and oddballs. Unlike the firsttypes of Xeper, which offer their greatest benefits earlier in life, this typecan exist through most of one’s initiation. XEPER OF PERCEPTION The contents of the mind reflect the psyche. These contents do not reflecteverything found in the psyche; for example, the mind cannot hold a memory ofthe future. Memories of past manifestations are likewise not mirrored, as suchknowledge would interfere with the revelation process. The psyche is drawn tothose ideas and images that reflect its vastness. So for humans who have chosenXeper, images of the vastness of space and the antiquity of time are soughtafter, as well as those aspects of art and music that hint at the great andterrible majesty of the soul. However, one does not find Xeper by simply lookingat the picture of a nebula. If the mind, using the fullest powers of itsreasoning, manages to see a larger level of reality than before, the psycheexperiences a greater mirroring. So advances in the truth process of art orscience can create Xeper. Xeper can be obtained any time the mind learns orcreates a new way to view the cosmos. Only humans who have sought training oreducation and have been active in the five steads of Xeper (see XEPER OFTEACHING) are likely to experience this. Like all forms of Xeper, differentpeople have different abilities and needs. Not everyone can be Stephen Hawking.Notably, this form of Xeper can occur on a large scale through certain naturaland human phenomena. Humans as a species experienced this at the time of themoon landing, for example. XEPER OF IPSEITY Everyone is on the Left-Hand Path during part of their lives. A certain amountof rebellion is needed in the teenage years for humans to become separateindividuals. This hormone-driven state leads to the Xeper of necessity. However,later in life when some humans become aware of the pattern in their lives, theyare able to have a Xeper that comes from knowing themselves. The act ofobserving and examining one’s life leads to a better mirroring of the psyche.This is the process of recognizing ipseity or, in other words, knowing oneself.This Xeper was the basis of the Greek civilization: gnothi seauton! It isimportant to know those things that are not yours as well as strengthening thosethings that are you. Setians hold that this type of Xeper is mastered by thosein the sixth degree. XEPER OF RETURN This is a fairly advanced experience. As we know the things we create bear ourlikeness and patterning. I have come into being, and by my coming into being,the way of coming into being is established. The actions we send into the worldbear our marks, and some of these actions will return to us in various ways.Unlike the Right-Hand Path notion of karma, which sees any interaction with theuniverse as entangling, Setians like to see their actions take on a life oftheir own. If a Setian puts a plan in motion that no longer needs his or herdirect guidance, with the plan’s next experience in the world, it istransformed. For example, Priest Jay founds a pylon, a local group of the Templeof Set, and moves away; then a couple of years later he attends one of thepylon’s Workings while in town for business. The patterns that reflect his Selfwill offer him a unique magnification of his psyche. This can range fromstarting a custom where you work to being a successful Magus. XEPER OF TEACHING When you take the contents of your psyche and express them so that they exist inother psyche’s mirrors, you have expanded yourself. Not your petty or greedyself, but the essential Self that began interacting with this world to know andevolve itself. In all of the six above steads of Xeper, the Xeper of teachingcan come into play as a means of objectifying the ultimate subject. This processis so useful to the psyche, we reserve four degrees to its practice. When oneteaches one does not become one with one’s students, but the students’ increasein essence when they achieve Xeper increases the essence of the teacher. It isthrough this relationship that Set made his bond with Mehen-Pet-Tha. Now why does the Prince of Darkness make his pact with us through this Word? Just as we experience our psyche as the ultimate subject, the ultimate subjectof the cosmos is Set. His stability, evolution, and perfection depend onperception and separation from the universe. This is not perception in the senseof just watching stars burn out and galaxies evolve. Divine perception meansunderstanding all aspects of all of Xeper. The universe poised at the moment ofeach of these myriad moments of Xeper is the realm wherein Set dwells. When weseek to know ourselves by doing extraordinary things, as in the steads of Xeper,we expand not only our power and joy but that of Set as well. Once this isunderstood by the psyche, a deep empowerment takes place, as we take part in theincrease of essence that began in year one. Great is the might of Set, andgreater still he through us. Now that you have seen how Xeper grew out of Thelema and is related to it, Iwant to compare and contrast the Words. The Word Thelema is an active one. Itsattributes include moving and daring. It is a revolt, the divine “No!” to ThouShalt! The Word is seen in such beasts as tigers and lions and hawks. It moves,it hunts, it takes, and the proof of its right to take is the success of thehunt. The lion’s right to take prey ends when it cannot outrun the antelope.Thelema is a martial Word associated with Horus Behdety, Montu, and Khonsu. Itis a Word weighted toward warfare, and its coming into being was packaged withstrategic advice for its Magus. It also took the form of a challenge; Crowleywas bidden to publish The Book of the Law so that his failures and successescould be judged and so its magickal underpinnings could be discovered and usedby people who were also seeking to embrace its philosophy. The Book of the Lawdemands study, and the material it will render its students is directly filteredthrough their lives at the moment of study. It is for all, in the sense that itis not a book conveyed through an institution, and it appeals to a basic part ofhuman psychology, the Will. The Word of Xeper refers to being. It calls for a balance of active and passiveforces. It refers to the change of one’s being through self-knowledge. Thischange may come through outside accident, study, choice of plans of action,completion of plans of action, and even from introspection. The Setian iscompelled to act to further his or her self-creation. The notion of Willexpressed in Thelema is taken as a given—not only philosophically but also inthe notion that powers of concentration and the need to cause magickal changeare necessary. One cannot find Xeper without being filled with a desire toact—every true increase of Being increases desire and the capacity to fulfillthat desire. The affirmation of desire that is a hallmark of Thelema is sharedequally in Setian thought. But Xeper also deals with passive forces; it is aunion of love and Will. The Setian, by understanding his or her desires,actually causes events and people to be summoned to him or her. The seal of Setthat adorns The Book of Coming Forth by Day is both a magickal talisman and apractical command to bring nobles to the Temple. Each Setian seeks to populatehis or her world with a community of “nobles”—an appeal that constrains andinforms the Setian’s ethics. If I am not acting in a manner that will bringnobles to me, I am not acting in accordance with my Xeper. Likewise the Setianneeds to demonstrate to his or her recognizing clergy that the difficult qualityof luck is shown in his or her life. Does the unexpected (both “good” and “bad”things) cause the Setian to grow in wisdom and might? If unique and interestingthings do not happen to me, I am not giving evidence of the change that comesbecause of my Xeper. Thus one of the tests that Setians use to judge thesoundness of their being is the quality of whom they meet and what happens tothem. Setians seek moments of Xeper—the self-knowledge that calls into being amore perfect and more permanent Self; the Setian would see this as the loveunion between the lesser Self of point consciousness and the contents of his orher psyche, which includes both known and unknown parts. The way that the Will is expressed differs in Thelema and Xeper. All forms ofjoy are seen as equally valid to the Thelemite. He or she exercises Will in anyecstasy. Therefore all things that move consciousness into a new configurationmust be held to be holy. The Setian welcomes all joys that further an awarenessand knowledge of the Self. Therefore the derangement of the senses by naturalmeans is seen as being more likely entertainment and to be evaluated by reason.A Thelemite is closer to God when he or she is high; the Setian is merely high.To the Setian, any insights that may be gained in such states are not validsimply by the test of joy, but they must be subjected to examination: Does thisjoy reflect and enhance my long desire? Carnal, emotional, and intellectualmaterial may all be used in the Setian pursuit of immortality, but each isweighed by succeeding approximations of the Self. The Thelemite seeks ecstasy;the Setian seeks entasy. Xeper and Thelema are both seen as ways of knowing the cosmos. The Thelemiteknows the world by overcoming it. His or her knowledge of the world is that ofjoyous conquest. Each problem solved, each new lover bedded, each adventure isboth the source of an understanding of the cosmos and a sacramental taking in ofyet another new sacrifice to Nuit. The Setian knows the world by understandingits use and effect on him or her. All things that reflect the Self to the Selfare sacred; thus what may be sacred to me (for example, the music of Steely Dan)may certainly not be sacred to you. As I find and express better creations ofmyself I will cause others to be inspired, and I am in turn inspired by theiractions. Human minds do not come into being from interesting patterns in ourgray matter but from interactions with other minds. Acting in the world in waysordered by my self-created ethics causes other people to help me expand myreasoning and both control and give profitable expression of my emotions. In ourcosmos, Set himself says that he created Horus so that he might know the cosmos.A Setian does not seek to overcome, eat, or fuck the cosmos but to make it into(and perceive it as) an ever-increasing matrix of possibility and free Will. ASetian in pursuit of his or her long desire (the desire that will give him orher self-knowledge) must both learn and teach. The Thelemite needs a world to resist and overcome; the Setian needs to clearspace for his or own creations. Both reject authority. The Thelemite understandsthe laws and social conventions of the host culture as methods to discourage theexercise of the Will before the seeker even starts. The Setian sees the laws andsocial conventions of the host culture as barriers against self-knowledge. Ifsomeone other than me tells me what I am, why I am here, and what I can andcan’t do, I lack a sovereign self. The text of another does my thinking for me. "},{"pageContent":"Alastor;or,The Spirit of Solitude By Percy Bysshe Shelley Shelley wrote this poem in 1815. Although his friend Thomas Peacock gave him thetitle “Alastor” as an “evil genius,” the poem refers to a spirit that inspiresthe poet. It has been oddly overlooked by Crowley scholars. It is an example ofthe receptive side of Thelema. In the process of seeking one’s true Will,certain patterns will appear in a film, a myth, a poem. These contain keys tothe imagination and the Will. This poem is a root as much as the Stele ofRevealing, and it is an interesting comment on Crowley’s attitude toward hisscarlet women. When the poet reaches the obscurest chasm, his last sight is themoon, and this experience encodes in him the path to transcendence within. > Earth, Ocean, Air, belovèd brotherhood!> If our great Mother has imbued my soul > With aught of natural piety to feel > Your love, and recompense the boon with mine; > If dewy morn, and odorous noon, and even, > With sunset and its gorgeous ministers, > And solemn midnight’s tingling silentness; > If Autumn’s hollow sighs in the sere wood, > And Winter robing with pure snow and crowns > Of starry ice the gray grass and bare boughs; > If Spring’s voluptuous pantings when she breathes > Her first sweet kisses, have been dear to me; > If no bright bird, insect, or gentle beast > I consciously have injured, but still loved > And cherished these my kindred; then forgive > This boast, belovèd brethren, and withdraw > No portion of your wonted favor now! > Mother of this unfathomable world!> Favor my solemn song, for I have loved > Thee ever, and thee only; I have watched > Thy shadow, and the darkness of thy steps, > And my heart ever gazes on the depth > Of thy deep mysteries. I have made my bed > In charnels and on coffins, where black death > Keeps record of the trophies won from thee, > Hoping to still these obstinate questionings > Of thee and thine, by forcing some lone ghost, > Thy messenger, to render up the tale > Of what we are. In lone and silent hours, > When night makes a weird sound of its own stillness, > Like an inspired and desperate alchemist > Staking his very life on some dark hope, > Have I mixed awful talk and asking looks > With my most innocent love, until strange tears,> Uniting with those breathless kisses, made > Such magic as compels the charmèd night > To render up thy charge; and, though ne’er yet > Thou hast unveiled thy inmost sanctuary, > Enough from incommunicable dream, > And twilight phantasms, and deep noonday thought, > Has shone within me, that serenely now > And moveless, as a long-forgotten lyre > Suspended in the solitary dome > Of some mysterious and deserted fane, > I wait thy breath, Great Parent, that my strain > May modulate with murmurs of the air, > And motions of the forests and the sea, > And voice of living beings, and woven hymns > Of night and day, and the deep heart of man. > There was a Poet whose untimely tomb> No human hands with pious reverence reared, > But the charmed eddies of autumnal winds > Built o’er his mouldering bones a pyramid > Of mouldering leaves in the waste wilderness: > A lovely youth—no mourning maiden decked > With weeping flowers, or votive cypress wreath, > The lone couch of his everlasting sleep: > Gentle, and brave, and generous—no lorn bard > Breathed o’er his dark fate one melodious sigh: > He lived, he died, he sung in solitude. > Strangers have wept to hear his passionate notes, > And virgins, as unknown he passed, have pined > And wasted for fond love of his wild eyes. > The fire of those soft orbs has ceased to burn, > And Silence, too enamoured of that voice, > Locks its mute music in her rugged cell. > By solemn vision and bright silver dream> His infancy was nurtured. Every sight > And sound from the vast earth and ambient air > Sent to his heart its choicest impulses. > The fountains of divine philosophy > Fled not his thirsting lips, and all of great, > Or good, or lovely, which the sacred past > In truth or fable consecrates, he felt > And knew. When early youth had passed, he left > His cold fireside and alienated home > To seek strange truths in undiscovered lands. > Many a wide waste and tangled wilderness > Has lured his fearless steps; and he has bought > With his sweet voice and eyes, from savage men, > His rest and food. Nature’s most secret steps > He like her shadow has pursued, where’er > The red volcano overcanopies > Its fields of snow and pinnacles of ice > With burning smoke, or where bitumen lakes > On black bare pointed islets ever beat > With sluggish surge, or where the secret caves, > Rugged and dark, winding among the springs > Of fire and poison, inaccessible > To avarice or pride, their starry domes > Of diamond and of gold expand above > Numberless and immeasurable halls, > Frequent with crystal column, and clear shrines > Of pearl, and thrones radiant with chrysolite. > Nor had that scene of ampler majesty > Than gems or gold, the varying roof of heaven > And the green earth, lost in his heart its claims > To love and wonder; he would linger long > In lonesome vales, making the wild his home, > Until the doves and squirrels would partake > From his innocuous hand his bloodless food, > Lured by the gentle meaning of his looks, > And the wild antelope, that starts whene’er > The dry leaf rustles in the brake, suspend > Her timid steps, to gaze upon a form > More graceful than her own. >  His wandering step,> Obedient to high thoughts, has visited > The awful ruins of the days of old: > Athens, and Tyre, and Balbec, and the waste > Where stood Jerusalem, the fallen towers > Of Babylon, the eternal pyramids, > Memphis and Thebes, and whatsoe’er of strange, > Sculptured on alabaster obelisk > Or jasper tomb or mutilated sphinx, > Dark Æthiopia in her desert hills > Conceals. Among the ruined temples there, > Stupendous columns, and wild images > Of more than man, where marble daemons watch > The Zodiac’s brazen mystery, and dead men > Hang their mute thoughts on the mute walls around, > He lingered, poring on memorials > Of the world’s youth: through the long burning day > Gazed on those speechless shapes; nor, when the moon > Filled the mysterious halls with floating shades > Suspended he that task, but ever gazed > And gazed, till meaning on his vacant mind > Flashed like strong inspiration, and he saw > The thrilling secrets of the birth of time. > Meanwhile an Arab maiden brought his food,> Her daily portion, from her father’s tent, > And spread her matting for his couch, and stole > From duties and repose to tend his steps, > Enamoured, yet not daring for deep awe > To speak her love, and watched his nightly sleep, > Sleepless herself, to gaze upon his lips > Parted in slumber, whence the regular breath > Of innocent dreams arose; then, when red morn > Made paler the pale moon, to her cold home > Wildered, and wan, and panting, she returned. > The Poet, wandering on, through Arabie,> And Persia, and the wild Carmanian waste, > And o’er the aërial mountains which pour down > Indus and Oxus from their icy caves, > In joy and exultation held his way; > Till in the vale of Cashmire, far within > Its loneliest dell, where odorous plants entwine > Beneath the hollow rocks a natural bower, > Beside a sparkling rivulet he stretched > His languid limbs. A vision on his sleep > There came, a dream of hopes that never yet > Had flushed his cheek. He dreamed a veilèd maid > Sate near him, talking in low solemn tones. > Her voice was like the voice of his own soul > Heard in the calm of thought; its music long, > Like woven sounds of streams and breezes, held > His inmost sense suspended in its web > Of many-colored woof and shifting hues. > Knowledge and truth and virtue were her theme, > And lofty hopes of divine liberty, > Thoughts the most dear to him, and poesy, > Herself a poet. Soon the solemn mood > Of her pure mind kindled through all her frame > A permeating fire; wild numbers then > She raised, with voice stifled in tremulous sobs > Subdued by its own pathos; her fair hands > Were bare alone, sweeping from some strange harp > Strange symphony, and in their branching veins > The eloquent blood told an ineffable tale. > The beating of her heart was heard to fill > The pauses of her music, and her breath > Tumultuously accorded with those fits > Of intermitted song. Sudden she rose, > As if her heart impatiently endured > Its bursting burden; at the sound he turned, > And saw by the warm light of their own life > Her glowing limbs beneath the sinuous veil > Of woven wind, her outspread arms now bare, > Her dark locks floating in the breath of night, > Her beamy bending eyes, her parted lips > Outstretched, and pale, and quivering eagerly. > His strong heart sunk and sickened with excess > Of love. He reared his shuddering limbs, and quelled > His gasping breath, and spread his arms to meet > Her panting bosom:—she drew back awhile, > Then, yielding to the irresistible joy, > With frantic gesture and short breathless cry > Folded his frame in her dissolving arms. > Now blackness veiled his dizzy eyes, and night > Involved and swallowed up the vision; sleep, > Like a dark flood suspended in its course, > Rolled back its impulse on his vacant brain. > Roused by the shock, he started from his trance—> The cold white light of morning, the blue moon > Low in the west, the clear and garish hills, > The distinct valley and the vacant woods, > Spread round him where he stood. Whither have fled > The hues of heaven that canopied his bower > Of yesternight? The sounds that soothed his sleep, > The mystery and the majesty of Earth, > The joy, the exultation? His wan eyes > Gaze on the empty scene as vacantly > As ocean’s moon looks on the moon in heaven. > The spirit of sweet human love has sent > A vision to the sleep of him who spurned > Her choicest gifts. He eagerly pursues > Beyond the realms of dream that fleeting shade; > He overleaps the bounds. Alas! alas! > Were limbs and breath and being intertwined > Thus treacherously? Lost, lost, forever lost > In the wide pathless desert of dim sleep, > That beautiful shape! Does the dark gate of death > Conduct to thy mysterious paradise, > O Sleep? Does the bright arch of rainbow clouds > And pendent mountains seen in the calm lake > Lead only to a black and watery depth, > While death’s blue vault with loathliest vapors hung, > Where every shade which the foul grave exhales > Hides its dead eye from the detested day, > Conducts, O Sleep, to thy delightful realms? > This doubt with sudden tide flowed on his heart; > The insatiate hope which it awakened stung > His brain even like despair. >  While daylight held> The sky, the Poet kept mute conference > With his still soul. At night the passion came, > Like the fierce fiend of a distempered dream, > And shook him from his rest, and led him forth > Into the darkness. As an eagle, grasped > In folds of the green serpent, feels her breast > Burn with the poison, and precipitates > Through night and day, tempest, and calm, and cloud, > Frantic with dizzying anguish, her blind flight > O’er the wide aëry wilderness: thus driven > By the bright shadow of that lovely dream, > Beneath the cold glare of the desolate night, > Through tangled swamps and deep precipitous dells, > Startling with careless step the moon-light snake, > He fled. Red morning dawned upon his flight, > Shedding the mockery of its vital hues > Upon his cheek of death. He wandered on > Till vast Aornos seen from Petra’s steep > Hung o’er the low horizon like a cloud; > Through Balk, and where the desolated tombs > Of Parthian kings scatter to every wind > Their wasting dust, wildly he wandered on, > Day after day, a weary waste of hours, > Bearing within his life the brooding care > That ever fed on its decaying flame. > And now his limbs were lean; his scattered hair, > Sered by the autumn of strange suffering, > Sung dirges in the wind; his listless hand > Hung like dead bone within its withered skin; > Life, and the lustre that consumed it, shone, > As in a furnace burning secretly, > From his dark eyes alone. The cottagers, > Who ministered with human charity > His human wants, beheld with wondering awe > Their fleeting visitant. The mountaineer, > Encountering on some dizzy precipice > That spectral form, deemed that the Spirit of Wind, > With lightning eyes, and eager breath, and feet > Disturbing not the drifted snow, had paused > In its career; the infant would conceal > His troubled visage in his mother’s robe > In terror at the glare of those wild eyes, > To remember their strange light in many a dream > Of after times; but youthful maidens, taught > By nature, would interpret half the woe > That wasted him, would call him with false names > Brother and friend, would press his pallid hand > At parting, and watch, dim through tears, the path > Of his departure from their father’s door. > At length upon the lone Chorasmian shore> He paused, a wide and melancholy waste > Of putrid marshes. A strong impulse urged > His steps to the sea-shore. A swan was there, > Beside a sluggish stream among the reeds. > It rose as he approached, and, with strong wings > Scaling the upward sky, bent its bright course > High over the immeasurable main. > His eyes pursued its flight:—‘Thou hast a home, > Beautiful bird! thou voyagest to thine home, > Where thy sweet mate will twine her downy neck > With thine, and welcome thy return with eyes > Bright in the lustre of their own fond joy. > And what am I that I should linger here, > With voice far sweeter than thy dying notes, > Spirit more vast than thine, frame more attuned > To beauty, wasting these surpassing powers > In the deaf air, to the blind earth, and heaven > That echoes not my thoughts?’ A gloomy smile > Of desperate hope wrinkled his quivering lips. > For sleep, he knew, kept most relentlessly > Its precious charge, and silent death exposed, > Faithless perhaps as sleep, a shadowy lure, > With doubtful smile mocking its own strange charms. > Startled by his own thoughts, he looked around.> There was no fair fiend near him, not a sight > Or sound of awe but in his own deep mind. > A little shallop floating near the shore > Caught the impatient wandering of his gaze. > It had been long abandoned, for its sides > Gaped wide with many a rift, and its frail joints > Swayed with the undulations of the tide. > A restless impulse urged him to embark > And meet lone Death on the drear ocean’s waste; > For well he knew that mighty Shadow loves > The slimy caverns of the populous deep. > The day was fair and sunny; sea and sky> Drank its inspiring radiance, and the wind > Swept strongly from the shore, blackening the waves. > Following his eager soul, the wanderer > Leaped in the boat; he spread his cloak aloft > On the bare mast, and took his lonely seat, > And felt the boat speed o’er the tranquil sea > Like a torn cloud before the hurricane. > As one that in a silver vision floats> Obedient to the sweep of odorous winds > Upon resplendent clouds, so rapidly > Along the dark and ruffled waters fled > The straining boat. A whirlwind swept it on, > With fierce gusts and precipitating force, > Through the white ridges of the chafèd sea. > The waves arose. Higher and higher still > Their fierce necks writhed beneath the tempest’s scourge > Like serpents struggling in a vulture’s grasp. > Calm and rejoicing in the fearful war > Of wave ruining on wave, and blast on blast > Descending, and black flood on whirlpool driven > With dark obliterating course, he sate: > As if their genii were the ministers > Appointed to conduct him to the light > Of those belovèd eyes, the Poet sate, > Holding the steady helm. Evening came on; > The beams of sunset hung their rainbow hues > High ’mid the shifting domes of sheeted spray > That canopied his path o’er the waste deep; > Twilight, ascending slowly from the east, > Entwined in duskier wreaths her braided locks > O’er the fair front and radiant eyes of Day; > Night followed, clad with stars. On every side > More horribly the multitudinous streams > Of ocean’s mountainous waste to mutual war > Rushed in dark tumult thundering, as to mock > The calm and spangled sky. The little boat > Still fled before the storm; still fled, like foam > Down the steep cataract of a wintry river; > Now pausing on the edge of the riven wave; > Now leaving far behind the bursting mass > That fell, convulsing ocean; safely fled— > As if that frail and wasted human form > Had been an elemental god. >  At midnight> The moon arose; and lo! the ethereal cliffs > Of Caucasus, whose icy summits shone > Among the stars like sunlight, and around > Whose caverned base the whirlpools and the waves > Bursting and eddying irresistibly > Rage and resound forever.—Who shall save?— > The boat fled on,—the boiling torrent drove,— > The crags closed round with black and jagged arms, > The shattered mountain overhung the sea, > And faster still, beyond all human speed, > Suspended on the sweep of the smooth wave, > The little boat was driven. A cavern there > Yawned, and amid its slant and winding depths > Ingulfed the rushing sea. The boat fled on > With unrelaxing speed.—‘Vision and Love!’ > The Poet cried aloud, ‘I have beheld > The path of thy departure. Sleep and death > Shall not divide us long.’ > The boat pursued> The windings of the cavern. Daylight shone > At length upon that gloomy river’s flow; > Now, where the fiercest war among the waves > Is calm, on the unfathomable stream > The boat moved slowly. Where the mountain, riven, > Exposed those black depths to the azure sky, > Ere yet the flood’s enormous volume fell > Even to the base of Caucasus, with sound > That shook the everlasting rocks, the mass > Filled with one whirlpool all that ample chasm; > Stair above stair the eddying waters rose, > Circling immeasurably fast, and laved > With alternating dash the gnarlèd roots > Of mighty trees, that stretched their giant arms > In darkness over it. I’ the midst was left, > Reflecting yet distorting every cloud, > A pool of treacherous and tremendous calm. > Seized by the sway of the ascending stream, > With dizzy swiftness, round and round and round, > Ridge after ridge the straining boat arose, > Till on the verge of the extremest curve, > Where through an opening of the rocky bank > The waters overflow, and a smooth spot > Of glassy quiet ‘mid those battling tides > Is left, the boat paused shuddering.—Shall it sink > Down the abyss? Shall the reverting stress > Of that resistless gulf embosom it? > Now shall it fall?—A wandering stream of wind > Breathed from the west, has caught the expanded sail, > And, lo! with gentle motion between banks > Of mossy slope, and on a placid stream, > Beneath a woven grove, it sails, and, hark! > The ghastly torrent mingles its far roar > With the breeze murmuring in the musical woods. > Where the embowering trees recede, and leave > A little space of green expanse, the cove > Is closed by meeting banks, whose yellow flowers > Forever gaze on their own drooping eyes, > Reflected in the crystal calm. The wave > Of the boat’s motion marred their pensive task, > Which naught but vagrant bird, or wanton wind, > Or falling spear-grass, or their own decay > Had e’er disturbed before. The Poet longed > To deck with their bright hues his withered hair, > But on his heart its solitude returned, > And he forbore. Not the strong impulse hid > In those flushed cheeks, bent eyes, and shadowy frame, > Had yet performed its ministry; it hung > Upon his life, as lightning in a cloud > Gleams, hovering ere it vanish, ere the floods > Of night close over it. >  The noonday sun> Now shone upon the forest, one vast mass > Of mingling shade, whose brown magnificence > A narrow vale embosoms. There, huge caves, > Scooped in the dark base of their aëry rocks, > Mocking its moans, respond and roar forever. > The meeting boughs and implicated leaves > Wove twilight o’er the Poet’s path, as, led > By love, or dream, or god, or mightier Death, > He sought in Nature’s dearest haunt some bank, > Her cradle and his sepulchre. More dark > And dark the shades accumulate. The oak, > Expanding its immense and knotty arms, > Embraces the light beech. The pyramids > Of the tall cedar overarching frame > Most solemn domes within, and far below, > Like clouds suspended in an emerald sky, > The ash and the acacia floating hang > Tremulous and pale. Like restless serpents, clothed > In rainbow and in fire, the parasites, > Starred with ten thousand blossoms, flow around > The gray trunks, and, as gamesome infants’ eyes, > With gentle meanings, and most innocent wiles, > Fold their beams round the hearts of those that love, > These twine their tendrils with the wedded boughs, > Uniting their close union; the woven leaves > Make network of the dark blue light of day > And the night’s noontide clearness, mutable > As shapes in the weird clouds. Soft mossy lawns > Beneath these canopies extend their swells, > Fragrant with perfumed herbs, and eyed with blooms > Minute yet beautiful. One darkest glen > Sends from its woods of musk-rose twined with jasmine > A soul-dissolving odor to invite > To some more lovely mystery. Through the dell > Silence and Twilight here, twin-sisters, keep > Their noonday watch, and sail among the shades, > Like vaporous shapes half-seen; beyond, a well, > Dark, gleaming, and of most translucent wave, > Images all the woven boughs above, > And each depending leaf, and every speck > Of azure sky darting between their chasms; > Nor aught else in the liquid mirror laves > Its portraiture, but some inconstant star, > Between one foliaged lattice twinkling fair, > Or painted bird, sleeping beneath the moon, > Or gorgeous insect floating motionless, > Unconscious of the day, ere yet his wings > Have spread their glories to the gaze of noon. > Hither the Poet came. His eyes beheld> Their own wan light through the reflected lines > Of his thin hair, distinct in the dark depth > Of that still fountain; as the human heart, > Gazing in dreams over the gloomy grave, > Sees its own treacherous likeness there. He heard > The motion of the leaves—the grass that sprung > Startled and glanced and trembled even to feel > An unaccustomed presence—and the sound > Of the sweet brook that from the secret springs > Of that dark fountain rose. A Spirit seemed > To stand beside him—clothed in no bright robes > Of shadowy silver or enshrining light, > Borrowed from aught the visible world affords > Of grace, or majesty, or mystery; > But undulating woods, and silent well, > And leaping rivulet, and evening gloom > Now deepening the dark shades, for speech assuming, > Held commune with him, as if he and it > Were all that was; only—when his regard > Was raised by intense pensiveness—two eyes, > Two starry eyes, hung in the gloom of thought, > And seemed with their serene and azure smiles > To beckon him. >  Obedient to the light> That shone within his soul, he went, pursuing > The windings of the dell. The rivulet, > Wanton and wild, through many a green ravine > Beneath the forest flowed. Sometimes it fell > Among the moss with hollow harmony > Dark and profound. Now on the polished stones > It danced, like childhood laughing as it went; > Then, through the plain in tranquil wanderings crept, > Reflecting every herb and drooping bud > That overhung its quietness.—‘O stream! > Whose source is inaccessibly profound, > Whither do thy mysterious waters tend? > Thou imagest my life. Thy darksome stillness, > Thy dazzling waves, thy loud and hollow gulfs, > Thy searchless fountain and invisible course, > Have each their type in me; and the wide sky > And measureless ocean may declare as soon > What oozy cavern or what wandering cloud > Contains thy waters, as the universe > Tell where these living thoughts reside, when stretched > Upon thy flowers my bloodless limbs shall waste > I’ the passing wind!’ >  Beside the grassy shore> Of the small stream he went; he did impress > On the green moss his tremulous step, that caught > Strong shuddering from his burning limbs. As one > Roused by some joyous madness from the couch > Of fever, he did move; yet not like him > Forgetful of the grave, where, when the flame > Of his frail exultation shall be spent, > He must descend. With rapid steps he went > Beneath the shade of trees, beside the flow > Of the wild babbling rivulet; and now > The forest’s solemn canopies were changed > For the uniform and lightsome evening sky. > Gray rocks did peep from the spare moss, and stemmed > The struggling brook; tall spires of windlestrae > Threw their thin shadows down the rugged slope, > And nought but gnarlèd roots of ancient pines > Branchless and blasted, clenched with grasping roots > The unwilling soil. A gradual change was here > Yet ghastly. For, as fast years flow away, > The smooth brow gathers, and the hair grows thin > And white, and where irradiate dewy eyes > Had shone, gleam stony orbs:—so from his steps > Bright flowers departed, and the beautiful shade > Of the green groves, with all their odorous winds > And musical motions. Calm he still pursued > The stream, that with a larger volume now > Rolled through the labyrinthine dell; and there > Fretted a path through its descending curves > With its wintry speed. On every side now rose > Rocks, which, in unimaginable forms, > Lifted their black and barren pinnacles > In the light of evening, and its precipice > Obscuring the ravine, disclosed above, > ’Mid toppling stones, black gulfs and yawning caves, > Whose windings gave ten thousand various tongues > To the loud stream. Lo! where the pass expands > Its stony jaws, the abrupt mountain breaks, > And seems with its accumulated crags > To overhang the world; for wide expand > Beneath the wan stars and descending moon > Islanded seas, blue mountains, mighty streams, > Dim tracts and vast, robed in the lustrous gloom > Of leaden-colored even, and fiery hills > Mingling their flames with twilight, on the verge > Of the remote horizon. The near scene, > In naked and severe simplicity, > Made contrast with the universe. A pine, > Rock-rooted, stretched athwart the vacancy > Its swinging boughs, to each inconstant blast > Yielding one only response at each pause > In most familiar cadence, with the howl, > The thunder and the hiss of homeless streams > Mingling its solemn song, whilst the broad river > Foaming and hurrying o’er its rugged path, > Fell into that immeasurable void, > Scattering its waters to the passing winds. > Yet the gray precipice and solemn pine> And torrent were not all;—one silent nook > Was there. Even on the edge of that vast mountain,> Upheld by knotty roots and fallen rocks,> It overlooked in its serenity> The dark earth and the bending vault of stars.> It was a tranquil spot that seemed to smile> Even in the lap of horror. Ivy clasped> The fissured stones with its entwining arms,> And did embower with leaves forever green> And berries dark the smooth and even space> Of its inviolated floor; and here> The children of the autumnal whirlwind bore> In wanton sport those bright leaves whose decay,> Red, yellow, or ethereally pale,> Rivals the pride of summer. ’Tis the haunt> Of every gentle wind whose breath can teach> The wilds to love tranquillity. One step,> One human step alone, has ever broken> The stillness of its solitude; one voice > Alone inspired its echoes;—even that voice> Which hither came, floating among the winds,> And led the loveliest among human forms> To make their wild haunts the depository> Of all the grace and beauty that endued> Its motions, render up its majesty,> Scatter its music on the unfeeling storm,> And to the damp leaves and blue cavern mould,> Nurses of rainbow flowers and branching moss,> Commit the colors of that varying cheek,> That snowy breast, those dark and drooping eyes. > The dim and hornèd moon hung low, and poured> A sea of lustre on the horizon’s verge> That overflowed its mountains. Yellow mist> Filled the unbounded atmosphere, and drank> Wan moonlight even to fulness; not a star> Shone, not a sound was heard; the very winds,> Danger’s grim playmates, on that precipice> Slept, clasped in his embrace.—O storm of death,> Whose sightless speed divides this sullen night!> And thou, colossal Skeleton, that, still> Guiding its irresistible career> In thy devastating omnipotence,> Art king of this frail world! from the red field> Of slaughter, from the reeking hospital,> The patriot’s sacred couch, the snowy bed> Of innocence, the scaffold and the throne,> A mighty voice invokes thee! Ruin calls> His brother Death! A rare and regal prey> He hath prepared, prowling around the world;> Glutted with which thou mayst repose, and men> Go to their graves like flowers or creeping worms,> Nor ever more offer at thy dark shrine> The unheeded tribute of a broken heart.> When on the threshold of the green recess> The wanderer’s footsteps fell, he knew that death> Was on him. Yet a little, ere it fled,> Did he resign his high and holy soul> To images of the majestic past,> That paused within his passive being now,> Like winds that bear sweet music, when they breathe> Through some dim latticed chamber. He did place> His pale lean hand upon the rugged trunk> Of the old pine; upon an ivied stone> Reclined his languid head; his limbs did rest,> Diffused and motionless, on the smooth brink> Of that obscurest chasm;—and thus he lay,> Surrendering to their final impulses> The hovering powers of life.

I realize a book by a former high priest of Setabout the “wickedest man in the world” has great geek value, but I didn’t writeit for that. This part of the book contains a good deal about the roots of Crowley’s thought.As Steven Katz, Ph.D., points out in his 1992 book Mysticism and Language,mystics (and by extension magickians) are not describing universal truthswithout a context. If some bearded man from the desert simply walked into ourmidst and started babbling about his visions without taking into account ourcultural background, we would think he was just a kook. The mystic must use theculture and the words around him or her to share the vision. The visions,however, destroy the context they are uttered in. The fresh fever replaces thecold thinking. People who bring such visions are usually dismissed as cranks,thieves of ideas, Satanists, minor thinkers, and so on while alive. Now, acentury after Crowley’s Cairo Working, he is beginning to enter the world ofrespectability. Before his words fossilize, I wanted to inject some life intothem, to make the image of the First Beast move, as horrified members of myaudience are now grasping. In the interests of spiritual honesty I should tellyou a little bit about myself and these essays, so that I will have a hardertime hoodwinking you. I originally didn’t even think of publishing them as a book. My first essayswere simply e-mails to other members of the Temple of Set. We had beendiscussing the hundred years that had passed from Crowley’s reception of TheBook of the Law and what response, if any, the Temple should have to thisanniversary. You see, the Temple of Set is not about the Law for All (Thelema)but about the Law for the Elect (Xeper), which appeared in potential inCrowley’s Work. Our founder, Michael Aquino, sees himself as the Second Beast,and we validate that magickal assertion. Crowley’s writings are not requiredreading for Setians, nor do we teach magickal methodology derived from histeachings. We are without Kabbalah, we avoid drugs, and we do not seek unionwith the universe. We date our origins as a Temple to the Santa Barbara Workingof 1975 CE, when Set spoke to Magister Michael Aquino. Aquino had a good deal ofinterest in Aleister Crowley, but Set apparently did not speak of Crowley’s Worksave as a curiosity to Him. Set’s emphasis was for the motion forward, but wehumans gain much power in understanding the roots of our past. When I began looking at the Crowley corpus I discovered that everyone hadopinions about the man: he was a terrible misogynist, a drug addict, and lived agood part of his life in poverty. He didn’t seem like a figure to be valorized.But his ideas were original and sound and most importantly they were manifest inthe world. They shaped almost everything in the English-speaking occult world.They shaped me, whether I liked it or not. Setians believe that they must come to own themselves. The Self is a sacredvessel of its future actions. So things that influence the Self must be examinedand seen as holy. Some must be lessened in their influence; others must bestrengthened and made conscious. The act of strengthening and refining what isin you is an act of self-creation (Xeper) as well as an act of magick since itdraws more of the same substance out of the eternal darkness. So for my ownpurely selfish reasons I wrote these essays. Setians believe that the act of sharing what they have discovered and tested bytheir actions is a magickal act of repayment to Set. They see Set as the sourceof individuality in the cosmos, the giver of the gift that allows you to shapethe universe inside your head into an everlasting, self-aware force in (but notin union with) the cosmos. Setians believe in fair play, that the forces in thecosmos helped them out by providing unspeakable richness, and thus they musthelp out those in the future by returning the favor. So for reasons of fairplay, I wrote these essays. I wrote them for you. Crowley had many good ideas and a great breakthrough. This breakthrough was notonly the material in The Book of the Law. Revelation is a gift; some folks havea knack for it, and others don’t. Thousands of humans can speak as or for a god;very few can create a matrix. It is not a required skill; there are other waysto knowledge. Crowley created—by hard work, guile, and sorcery—a matrix in whichhis words could Work. If you are Working with forces that can allow mankind toself-evolve, you must acknowledge the lesson of learning “how one Word leads toanother Word and one Work leads to another Work.” The breakthrough was that thematrix through which the souls of individual men and women awaken is subject tochange by the Work of individual men and women. Or more succinctly, magick inthe past changed your probabilities, and magick in the here and now is changingyour possibilities. As this knowledge could increase the store of human powerand happiness, it was his duty to pass it on to the world. It is not an elitistknowledge; instead the Law is for all. Crowley drew his Work from three sources beyond his own genius: thenineteenth-century notion of progress (coupled with the nineteenth-century loveof origins), the eclectic and folkloric nature of occultism, and the traditionsof the three great monotheist faiths. His view of æonic change is strictlymodernist: “We don’t know anything with certainty, but each scientific discoveryhelps mankind know the truth.” The search for origins is implicit in this view(and gave us thinkers from Darwin to H. G. Wells); basically, if we know thedirection of history we can move more rapidly into a better world. The greattide of Christianity had effectively eclipsed the occult traditions of theancient world. Some of these had begun coming back as early as 1492 and thetranslation of the Corpus Hermeticum, and others were appearing in books formagickians that drew on such secret knowledge as was available; the overwhelmingbelief was that, somehow, all of this material could be fitted together into anoperative whole. Crowley had joined the Golden Dawn and had received the bestsort of training available in this school of magick. Last, Crowley saw his workin the terms of his host culture. He took his name from the First Beast of thebook of Revelation, he took the name of his supreme Law from The Book of the Lawin the second book of the Kings, he took his framework from Bereshit Kabbalah,and he took his approach from Mohammed. By this method he realized in bothhimself and the objective universe a reworking of the forces that shape theworld, and he created a new path to happiness. Few books deal with the ideas of Crowley, the First Beast. His ideas are hard tograsp, but the colorful life always makes entertaining reading. No books dealwith his ideas from a sympathetic, non-Thelemic perspective. I am giving myinformed opinions on a variety of his formulas. I am not doing this to preach toThelemites (nor even to preach to Setians) but to allow other ways for his ideasto live in the world. I am doing this to expand human happiness, not to argue orconvert. If anyone is offended that my opinions are not the same as his or hers,I am sorry, and I sincerely wish you well as you seek your Will. I did not write these essays to valorize the man Crowley. I cannot lend praiseto the way he treated women, his friends, or himself. I did not write these essays to demonize the man Crowley. I can say good thingsabout his heroism, his curiosity, and his sense of fun. I have divided these essays into two sections. The first is called “The Force.”It consists of eleven essays given to members of the Temple of Set via thefirst-degree mailing list. It is a Setian text. It is about achieving theresults that the First Beast achieved. It is about “doing.” The second sectionis called “The Fire.” It consists of twenty essays created for the originalbook. I wrote them for people who have had some experience of Crowley, to helpthem see some of the ideas that flow through his work and beyond his work intothe world. They are about the types of existence the words of the First Beasthave opened in humankind. They are about “being.” I have tried forstraightforward prose throughout, but I am a magickian and therefore have placeda little magick here and there. By “Force” a human can create a network, a community, a mesocosmos that canrespond to a Word. It is hard work making a group of people who are cooperativeindividuals, ready to reflect an idea back and forth among themselves. Fewhumans have the skill and patience for this. If you can create such a group, youhave the chance to bring them “Fire.” If they are ready they will burn with yourvision but not be consumed. Knowing how to start Fire has been the sign of theMaster magickian since the time of Prometheus. Under the formula of Force and Fire I send these essays into the world. I trustthat they will bring happiness and illumination to those who Will it. Seek theroots of stars! "},{"pageContent":"The Force 1 image [images/00006.jpg] CAIRO The results of the Cairo Working are far flung. The cipher of The Book of theLaw proclaimed the coming of the Second Beast, and the Word of Æon may have evenbeen heard imperfectly by Mr. Crowley. He heard Coph as the Word of theDouble-Wanded One. He later wrote “Coph Nia,” but I think that the Word lookslike the Egyptian pronunciation of Xeper, which is Khupfur, “kheffer.” It wasnot yet time to let mankind relearn that it is the spirit form of the cosmos.Soon after 1904 a great deal of certainty about the cosmos was to vanish. Timeand space were to become relative, and Gödel was about to introduce a certainuncertainty into mathematics. Also, in 1904 English Egyptologist Sir FlindersPetrie was digging up Midian and found that the first alphabetic writing didindeed come from there; however, it was not the Ten Commandants but a goddessname, Baalat. All across this planet there will be readings of The Book of the Law every yearon April 8, 9, and 10 to mark the reception in 1904. Some of these readings willbe done by conscious beings who will therefore receive insight. Most will bedone by unconscious beings, and their readings will ensure that the Book remainson the Earth. If a Setian is so inclined to Work with the 93 current, there are four questionsto be mindful of, which will enhance and focus your experience. These questionsrevolve around the place of the Working, the nature of the receiver, the natureof the messenger, and the influence of the Work. I’ll look at these fourquestions and trust in your genius to make use of the answers presented. Why Cairo? 1. An Egyptian would have told you that it was the place where the creation of the world took place. 2. It was a place that looked back to the pagan past, so that Bes-na-Maut’s stele, the Stele of Revealing, was there. So it was suitable for remanifesting lost wisdom. 3. It is on the 33° of latitude, which (like Dallas, Texas) has certain Masonic meanings thanks to John Dee’s pal, the Flemish geographer and cartographer Gerardus Mercator, who method of map making gave the British navy the upper hand for centuries. 4. It was a supercosmopolitan city where an Englishman could masquerade as a Persian prince with a Hebrew name while learning Arabic. In short, it was the crossroads of crossroads. It was the place to get the Law for All. Why Crowley? 1. A twenty-nine-year-old man (meaning that he is creating the synthesis that will carry him through adulthood), having internalized a magickal system and feeling that he had been betrayed by his mentor MacGregor Mathers, is as much of a crossroads as the great city. 2. Crowley knew that playtime was nearly over. The woman he had married on a whim was with child, and they were going back to Scotland to start up a life. 3. Crowley was open; even though he thought Rose was stupid (Crowley’s misogyny neither invalidates his Work nor does his Work pardon his misogyny), he took her clairvoyance seriously. He had come to Cairo to play and set out to take advantage of his repressed childhood (“Mama called me the Beast so I’m going be the Beast”), the heritage of Persia (“I’ll tell people I’m a Persian prince”), and his knowledge of Hebrew (“I’ll go by the Hebrew word for ‘beast’). He was set up to transform every drop of himself, and he had collected the right drops—some consciously and some unconsciously. 4. He had an overdeveloped ego and a desire to be known as a writer and even a messiah, so he had the hook of the devil already in him. Who Spoke to Him? 1. When Crowley asked the moral nature of the entity, Rose told him it was Fire (Sh) and Force (T). The Hebrew letters Shin and Teth stand for “Fire” and “Force”—together they spell “Set,” the demonic Initiator. 2. Bes-na-Maut, the priest whose stele was the gateway, was a Montu priest of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty. Bes-na-maut’s adult name was Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu. His father, grandfather, and others in his family had the same birthname. (In Crowley’s time the stele had been considered to be an artifact of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty.) The setian priesthood had merged into the Montu priesthood during the Twenty-first Dynasty as Set became unpopular, but the war god of Thebes remained popular. Besna-Maut’s Canaanite name indicated he would be of the Setian faction. 3. Set revealed in The Book of Coming Forth by Night that he had spoken to the First Beast. The Double-Wanded One actually said Xeper, so his influence was held. What Was the Nature of the Message? 1. It affected you where you are sitting now, even if you thought Crowley was just a random dummy. It not only led to an understanding of magick that was the best since late antiquity, it also had a direct effect on the degree system the Church of Satan eventually built. 2. It had a massive effect on popular and high culture, from Crowley’s face on a Beatles album to English author Aldous Huxley trying mescaline. (From Huxley followed Timothy Leary, Robert Anton Wilson, Carlos Castaneda, etc.) Frankly, no Crowley, no sixties. 3. One of Crowley’s Left-Hand-Path leaning disciples, Frater Belarion, did magickal workings that may have had a little bit to do with the Second Beast’s birth and certainly led to the establishment of Scientology. 4. Crowley had a hard time getting his work published and distributed in his lifetime, but now you’ll find him in every major bookstore. 5. When Crowley wrote the constitution of the OTO, there were (I believe) two members in the United States. It would behoove us to see how his Work went over so well in one hundred years and figure out with our non-drug-addled brains what we should be doing to achieve the same. Let us consider both the “inertia of the cosmos” that this Working brings us andthe challenge it provides. 2 image [images/00006.jpg] HADIT In The Book of the Law, Crowley met the three faces of his daemon Aiwass. Thethree faces were gathered under the banner of the Lord of Silence. The threefaces of this fourfold god are Nu (or Nuit), Had (or Hadit), and Ra-Hoor-Khuit.Hadit is the symbol of the individual, a single star in the night sky called thecollective unconscious, an atman, a microcosm. The word is derived from theArabic hadith, which means “tradition” (like the Hebrew word “kaballah”) or“divinely inspired utterance.” Both of these meanings could be applied to TheBook of the Law itself. Crowley had been studying Arabic and the world of theQur’an before the revelations in Cairo. His admiration for Mohammed and thestory (sunnah) of his life permeated his thinking. Mohammed is an exemplar ofForce. He inspired Crowley as he had earlier inspired the Knights Templar. Letus consider hadith and two associated puns. Tradition might seem an unusual word for “consciousness.” It has a dual meaning:one for the subjective universe and one for the objective universe. Both ofthese meanings are useful to the Setian. Subjective Hadith Is the Tradition of Being Yourself There is a lot to this. Its closest analogues in world religions are thetraditions of Metatron, the Recording Angel (the deified Enoch); the Egyptianib, or heart; or the Munin of the Germanic people. If you saw every day of yourlife as a scroll on which you recorded every thought and feeling and sensationthat you had, you would begin to understand Hadit. Consider some of theimplications. Freud showed that things written on the scroll, but forgotten orrepressed, ruled where our thoughts come from (and that we could have betterthoughts if we remembered what was written). Buddhism teaches us that if wewrite certain things each day (meditation) we can overcome badly writtenthoughts. Literature teaches us that if you want your book to be good you’ve gotto give the hero obstacles and themes. Art tells us that if you want your bookto be beautiful you’d better have some great pictures in it. Henri Bergson, theFrench philosopher and author of Time and Free Will, teaches us that the more welearn to manipulate how we record time the longer we can choose to live.Alcoholics Anonymous teaches us that although we may try for a geographic cure,even when we move into a new matrix we carry our old selves. Hadith is the guide to what works and what doesn’t. It tells us that, no matterwhat our consciousness tells us, there are certain things that can’t be changed.It tells us that we can order our own destiny, not choose it. Hadith is the assemblage point for thoughts, feelings, and sensations. Asmagickians we can nudge it into different places; Crowley recommend drugs andsex, fasting and dreaming, travel and art (of all kinds). None of these thingsproduces a permanent change. Setians eschew the routes that damage the hardware. All humans recognize that they are not the sole authors of their scrolls, andmost recognize that their attitude controls much of it. So some of thisrevelation is common sense, but this is true of all Laws. The magickal partcomes in the relationship of this truth to the truths of the other faces. The objective side of hadith is that human traditions contain all of thematerial to make use of all of your internal material. All around you, although mainly in hidden (or occult) repositories, is thematerial. It is not simply enough to read this material; one must activate it.Thus salvation comes from the traditions of the world, consciously sought afterand enacted in accordance with Will. This idea at first seems alien; why shouldI need anything beyond myself for my self-actualization? There are three reasons, which I will give in increasing order of importance. First, you need something by which you can measure your progress and recognizeyour blind spots. If you are working with the twenty-four runes of the ElderFuthark, you will notice that you understand some runes well and others are hardto grasp. You already have a map of where your blind spots are. As you continueto work with the runes, you will discover that some operations work well for you(e.g., money magick) and others do not work well (e.g., love). So you know thatparts of yourself need to be strengthened; is there something in your psychethat keeps love at bay, or do you simply need to bathe more often? This becomesa mute initiator for when the love shows up; you will have to look to the systemagain as you analyze questions about your new situation. Second, the way the system is hidden from you is a map of your soul and thevector for your force. If you find the system via the academic world, then theacademic world is your field of transformations. If you find what you need inthe military, in the helping professions, in travel, or another field, there iswhere your lifework will lie. You will learn things from the people who pointand bar the way, and you will learn what type of things are needed for you. Doyou need to weed through a great deal of material finding the truth? Do you needto go where few have gone before? Do you need symbols or matter, community orhermit teachers? Third, the Work of past magickians is incarnate in you. You can’t ignore thepast; it is not only in every word you read, every technique you learn, it iseven in your DNA. To master its power you have to return to the root and reworkit. Crowley wasn’t obsessed with ancient lore or even etymology because it wascool; it was because he had to know it to know himself. The past is not past,and it acts for you every time you think you’re really and truly on your own.You can, however, begin to choose which parts of the past and why. But you haveno more option to ignore the past than to ignore your species. She who can see these two processes, of being the product of a tradition andbeing the founder of a new tradition at the same time, as one has seen hadith. I promised to mention two puns that are connected with hadith. The obvious one is the sixty-seventh of the “Beautiful Names of Allah,” Al Ahad,which means “the One” and confers the power of “opening certain secrets” onthose who chant it with a pure heart or engrave it on a talisman. Its number is44. Indeed, one of the secrets of The Book of the Law is to take its 220 versesin groups of 44. The second pun would be the name Behdety. This title of Horus appears on theStele of Revealing. Horus of Edfu, he is the most pissed off of the Horuses. Heis not the same as the child Horus, because he was one of the judges at theContendings of Horus and Seth. He is the older Horus who in archaic times wasSet’s brother and rival (rather than Set’s nephew). He was the god ofsovereignty, and his planet was Mars. In Crowley’s time, little was writtenabout this god, and he was most drawn to Horus the Child as the symbol of theauthentic self (that is to say the kid before society screws him up). HorusBehdety is the symbol of someone born to be a leader and trained to be king; hewas someone who knew how to be a scribe, priest, warrior, magickian, and judge,who because of his training could control the force of the Two Lands. This elderform of Horus is slowly reemerging, but he could only return after theConquering Child had told people to pay attention to child rearing. If you wantkings, you have to begin with enriched environments. The tradition of being kingbegins by being prince. Crowley often saw Behdety as a reflection of Had, andthis is right because the sun reflects the self-ruler, and Mars reflects thosewho fight to uncover tradition from centuries of repression. 3 image [images/00006.jpg] PERDURABO When Crowley joined the Golden Dawn he took a new name, which was one of themost useful magickal formulas of his life. Perdurabo means “I will endure to theend.” For the Indo-Europeanists among us, the root of the Latin verb “perdurabo”the “dura” part is the same as the roots of English words true, tree, troth, andso on. It is an amazingly important formula. At first it just seems like common sense. “If I don’t finish all the dishes, thedishes aren’t done.” “If I don’t mail in my taxes, I don’t get a refund.” But ishas a magickal meaning as well. Only if you endure can the transformations occurin you that make you who you want to be. Pop books on magick tell you that you have to “believe” in magick for it towork. This is not so; you have to “do” magick in order for it to work. We don’t get our individuality from subjectivity; we get it throughsubjectivity. In other words, we bring a feeling-thought complex to the surface of our beingand work on it. We work on it by objective means. If we endure in our working,we change ourselves. It is easy to change our minds, but it is hard to keep thechange. Let’s use a practical example. Lets take a look at three new Setians whom we shall call Ralph, Suzi, and Binky. Ralph has decided that all Setianism is horseshit. He just read his crystaltablet, and he’s going to go to the pylon meeting he agreed to go to, and thenhe’s out of there. Suzi has decided that the most important thing is to keep an open mind and notmake any decisions; she’s going to her first pylon meeting tonight. Binky has decided that the Temple of Set is run by the hidden chiefs and that hewill absorb every word as gospel at the pylon meeting. Their attitudes will determine their changes, because their attitudes willchange—if they endure to the end. Ralph goes, and, having met other Setians face-to-face, decides that the templemay well be worthwhile, and he commits to six months. He had to be convinced byexperience, and for the rest of his career in the temple he will Work change onhimself by this method. He will therefore teach by this method. (But Ralph couldhave remained unchanged, and his attitude would have become a Law that kept himfrom occult groups forever, as well as determining the message he would tell hisfriends.) Suzi is very quiet and finally asks a few questions that make her decide thatthe temple may be the place for her. Her temple career is based on observationand questioning. She becomes great at dialogue, and she either becomes a greatteacher in the temple or talks herself out of it since magickal phenomena can’tbe proved. Binky is totally blown away by the meeting and posts his butt off on the templemailing list for six months until a charismatic Wiccan/Scientologist/voodooMaster speaks in front of him, and then he finds new hidden chiefs. Or a reallygood priest makes Binky think for himself, and then anything can happen. None of these changes could take place with just the real activity in the outerworld. The magickian uses the outer world to change the inner world bycommitment, by Will. Magickians do not have to believe in magick, they have to do magick. As theMagus Nemo said, “It is not faith but doubt that sets you free.” Crowley used this formula all of his life. It always reminded him to keep hisbeginner’s mind (with its doubts, speculations, fears, and wonder), and itreminded him that only by seeing things through in the outer world can theforces in the inner world be changed. Magick is neither easy nor does it take care of itself. Thinking your waythrough a change is not making the change. Only the mind, with doubt, fear, andwonder, can learn to see and live in another world, one transformed inaccordance with your Will. 4 image [images/00006.jpg] DISCERNMENT AND THELEMA One of the odd pieces of advice that Mr. Crowley gives us frequently in hiswritings as part of our development is that we should learn not to think aboutthe differences between things. On the surface this seems absurd; I obviouslywant to know the difference between drain cleaner and sugar when I make cinnamontoast. However, once his instructions are seen as a part of a magickal andinitiatory system there is some wisdom in his suggestion, if we approach thisidea with moderation, which is the watchword of the Left-Hand Path, rather thansubmission, which is the watchword of the Right-Hand Path. I want to look at theFirst Beast’s idea and consider its usefulness in Setian initiation. Crowley’s idea comes from practical magickal experience and from four humansources: the Buddha, Lao-tsu, Nietzsche, and the Marquis de Sade. From the Buddha, Crowley drew the idea of dissatisfaction as a threat to thepath. Consider the person who can never enjoy his life. He has won second placein a tough contest, but he knows only agony that he did not get first place. Hesees the person at the table next to his at the restaurant has cherries jubilee,and suddenly he hates his cheesecake. He drops his friend of many years who is achiropractor to impress his new friend who is a doctor. This dissatisfactiondoes not lead to better states of being but to an anxiety that keeps him fromever awakening. There is no moment that is real to this person because hisconnection to the outside universe is shattered by his imagination of its flaws.He can never appreciate what he has, which means he is unhappy (and those whoare unhappy don’t know Xeper). More importantly, he tells his psyche all thetime, “You don’t do very good magick.” Eventually the psyche will give up. Whyshould it change the possibilities, when it will be castigated? From Lao-tsu, Crowley drew the idea of process. Magickians send out a mysteriousmessage and receive a mysterious reply from the universe. This means they haveto be open to the process unfolding by the art that is theirs to command, ratherthan being a critic of the process (having, as they say, “lust for results.”) Itmakes me think of the Taoist fable of the horse. See my comments on versesIII-12 to III-15 above. The magickian learns to accept the bigger picture, that his magick is Working,and does not make judgments as the process unfolds. The flu that keeps you homemay keep you from the car wreck. The unstable magickian tries to change theprocess at every step and winds up living in a muddy magickal soup. From Nietzsche, Crowley received the idea that the Will provides its owntraining. We need a certain number of failures to become strong and craftyenough for success. If at every setback we gave up, we certainly would neverhave learned to ride a bike. If at every brick wall we just called on ourparents, God, or the state to save us, we would not have developed Will. Theinitiate does not waste his time bemoaning setbacks and seeking aid; he spendshis energy thinking his way out of the situation, and in so doing develops Will. From the Marquis de Sade, Crowley drew the idea that classifying everything aspleasant or unpleasant means you have a lot of unpleasant things in your life.How much more pleasant your life would be if you could learn to find as manysensations and situations pleasant as possible. I won’t dwell on the sexualimplications of this. Consider something you do daily, like riding the subway.How different would your entire life be if rather than spending ten minutes aday hating some experience, you made it your quest to find it a pleasurableexperience (e.g., reading the posters, studying the crowd, enjoying the hot airon cold days, etc.)? Beyond these four sources, Crowley drew on practical magickal experience. Peoplehave only so much energy. Would you prefer spending your energy on classifying acurrent experience or trying to beckon a wonderful experience out of theunmanifest, which the profane call the “future”? Magickians usually come fromgroups that spend all their time critiquing the present and then at some pointdiscover the energy they use on parody and sarcasm could just as well be spenton having a better future. They seem less cool then, but much closer to beingcaptains of their own fate. So consider how Crowley’s instruction to his adepts not to distinguish any thingfrom any other thing may be a useful one; it is also a very, very hard thing tolearn. Learning to receive what the universe gives requires a deep faith inyourself and your magick. It will make you calm, and it will make you daring(since you know that the universe will give you what you need and frequentlywhat you want). 5 image [images/00006.jpg] LOVE UNDER WILL “Love under Will” is sadly either given a sexual connotation, only, or otherwiseused to justify bad behavior in Thelemic relationships. Although Crowley himselfused it for both of these reasons, it has more useful and important meanings formagickians, even Setians. I would like to look at these and pass them on to youas part of giving life to the image of the First Beast. “Love under Will” is the formula of consecration, which Crowley explains asmagick. Let us look at the nature of love in his system and its meanings forobjects, the parts of the Self, specific people, and the world. This essay islimited to the idea of love in initiatory matters; it is not a guide to life,your emotions, or your soul. Love is the force that selects or elects. It is a preconscious force. In otherwords most of the time we don’t form a plan to fall in love with somebody orsomething. Love comes first, and the intellect follows with reason to supportit. Love often makes our lives very unhappy; in Egyptian terms it is a bringerof confusion (isfet) and an enemy of order (maat). Your life is going along justfine and wham! Love enters the picture. Everything is rearranged. Love can spoilyour plans for school, employment, your relationship with your family, where youlive, and many other things. It belongs to the realm of Set. For most humanslove is the greatest initiatory force that will ever intrude on their lives. Itis far more powerful than anything we call up in the chamber. So how can something so dangerous be allowed into the initiatory life? Wouldn’tit be better to have an initiation planned by reason? Sadly, no. If our initiation were planned by reason, it would lack anything thatleads to discovering the mysteries of the self. If you got to plan your lifewhen you were eight or eighteen, you would not have designed the person you arenow. Hence, for most of our lives the forces that initiate seem to be outside ofourselves. But the initiate knows that once he has put his feet on the path,those forces work for the path. Love is under Will the very moment that onesays, “I wish to initiate myself.” The great forces of the universe will alwaysaid in our initiation; this is why initiation sucks. It would be much morepleasant if we didn’t get help. Of course one must keep in mind two things; theuniverse is inside your head, and it effects that universe outside your head. Love of objects comes from the universe inside your head making itself known toyou. Your Self is always trying to be noticed by your self. Think of it asflirting. When an object becomes special, you will get better results with it.If you bowl, your ball is just better than anyone else’s, if you golf, yourclubs, and so on. This is even more true of your magickal tools. This is theeasiest way to understand “love under Will.” Your love for your wand, fire pot,dagger, or other object is part of the link that makes things in the objectiveuniverse obey your subjective universe. Now once an object has known your love,its mere existence changes you. If you consecrate a dagger to represent thecutting power of your mind (or at least the cutting power you want your mind tohave), every time you see or think of the dagger, your wish is reactivated. Allhumans know this magick because all humans have a universe inside their headstrying to be noticed. Most humans cannot choose what to consecrate, so someother group of humans chooses for them: a cross, a swastika, a statue, a book,and so on. This form of primate dominance is called the Right-Hand Path in ourterms. All of us have imprinted on it, and as part of our path we choose to endsome of those imprints. So we put graffiti in a hotel Bible, stamp on a host, orperform some other act of defiance. Some initiates think they are above suchthings. Magick happens in the mind, so they feel they do not need to apply the“love under Will” formula and consecrate any objects. They do not come to theeven higher level of understanding that objects in the objective universe arelinks to that universe. The armchair magickian can link only to the universeinside his head—like building a bridge with both ends on the same side of ariver. Love of parts of the Self is easy to understand intellectually, but hard topractice. After we set our feet on the path of initiation, we must love theparts of ourselves—because we are stuck with them. This is without a doubt thehardest part of initiation to grasp. We like to think that we can tear out this,burn out that, and repress the other thing, and that then we will be perfect.The shocker is you are perfect right now. You have everything you need to doanything you wish. However, we prefer to think that our “weaknesses”—fear,laziness, short tempers—are holding us back. So we push hard against them. Thereis a universe inside your head. If you spend all your time pushing againstsomething with your daylight mind, your night side is compelled to push back.Most people prefer models of original sin (“I’m screwed up!”) and spend theirbrief careers in the Temple of Set (or other manifestations of the path)pushing, and then failing. Others “get” the secret of the magickal tools ontheir altar (“I should use the dagger to cut, the fire to burn, the fan to makebreezes, etc.”). You should use your fear to keep you alive, but not to keep youtimid; to keep you on the path, not to socialize you. You can apply yourlaziness to your desire to engage in a flame war, rather than apply yourself toyour daily meditation. All the parts must be loved, because all the parts mustbe used. This notion precedes Xeper; only in moments of self-love can onerealize that the self-creation of the universe inside your head is the greatestlove gift of the Self to the self. This notion tried to emerge in 1948 withFrater Achad’s Word, AL, but his own lack of understanding led him down thewrong path. This notion did emerge eighteen years later in Anton LaVey’s Word,Indulgence. Love of the parts of the Self (not just the abstract idea of theSelf) links Xeper and Thelema historically, æonically, and experientially. Love for specific people is the darkest and most dangerous thing that humansdeal with, so they color it pink, image it as the female genitalia plus buttocks(and call it a “heart”), and sell cards on Lupercalia (February 14). It is theonly Left-Hand-Path force that is socially acceptable to quest for, and all ofour popular fiction claims that it always brings a happy ending. We tell ourchildren that it is an unalloyed good. We don’t say that it causes suffering,changes lives more than anything, and will break all the patterns on your lifeas no other force ever will. To make love more palatable we excuse it withbiology, saying that male-female love leading to babies is okay. Love is theforce that comes when the universe inside your head finds a complete universethat has what it needs for change. That means something in the beloved (even inpotential form) can help the universe inside you gel into an immortal form. Soit will cause you to see the other as the perfect being you must change yourselffor, and change all your life for. This spell of love lasts from nine tofourteen months. After that you are on your own, to find what it is in the otherthat you need, and you do this by becoming what the other needs. The second partof love—love after the spell is gone—is nearly extinct in America as Americanslack Will (so most of our marriages end in divorce). Love in a nonsexual contextruns the same length. Sadly we lack Will, and we are often like Crowley, whopretty much turned on all of his friends and wound up poor and alone. Love mayfind new objects as you change yourself; this too will lead to much pain. Love for the world is the last step in the initiatory path. The Right-Hand Paththinks that it is the first step and therefore is filled with people so riddenwith guilt as to be good cash cows. Love for the world comes when love for theSelf is perfect. When the universe inside your head has been accepted and ismoving to its own vast and multifaceted destiny, you come to love the world.This means that you will find something in the world to change that will reflectthe world within. If you love justice, you will work for justice, if nature,then you will work for nature, and so on. This pouring out of love is oftencalled “evil” because it threatens the status quo. It may look good in a movie,but when you are giving time and money to change the world, you are an object ofderision. The temple’s degree of Magus is an example of love in action. TheMagus shares the central idea of his heart—his Word—to empower and transformthose whom he loves, which may even include all of mankind. But for all of usthe love for the world makes us dangerous. Do not be fooled with the smilingimage of the Right-Hand Path saint who accepts the world; as you increase inbeing you will have more to change, your methods will be more efficient, andyour love will inspire others. It is the duty of the Left-Hand-Path initiate to win back love and see it as theforce of raw change. He or she should not buy into the pink love that assumes“everything will work out.” He or she must allow his or her love of the world tobegin with the real physical objects of the altar and end with that personbecoming a change agent in the world of mankind. As the centennial of the CairoWorking draws near, think of the love in your initiation, tell stories to us ofhow you got your favorite magickal tools, think about why the Right-Hand Pathhas lied to you about the nature of love, and think about what it means that thebigger issues of the world work to give you arenas for your initiation once youhave said your wish for it. Love Is The Law, Love Under Will 6 image [images/00006.jpg] MAGICK AND POLITICS The First Beast described the art of magick as using the inertia of the cosmos.His model of the universe was that magick worked well when it was in harmonywith the universe and did not work if it was opposed to the universe. I wouldlike to look at his ideas from his perspective, then reexamine them in a Setianperspective. Let’s look at how magick Works according to Crowley. It is Mr. Smith’s Will tobe downtown at 2:00 p.m. Mr. Smith checks the bus schedules and gets on thedowntown bus at 1:45 p.m. when it passes his apartment. Mr. Smith’s Will hasbeen fulfilled, and the cosmos suffered very little strain, if any. Now let’s look at how magick fails according to Crowley. It is Mr. Jones’ Willto be downtown at 2:00 p.m. At 1:59 p.m. he walks out of his apartment andstarts yelling at passing cars to stop and take him downtown. Magick happens when one harmonizes one’s needs with the infinite forces of thecosmos. Very few people ever discover their needs in time to manifest them, orif they discover them, they think that knowledge alone will compel God to granttheir needs to them. They can’t take advantage of the inertia of the cosmos, andthey spend their time like the second Mr. Jones, running around in the streetyelling and eventually being run over. This is the nature of the magick. It doesn’t take much to see that if everyone followed this practice of magickthe world would be happier and more efficient. The world is seen as anopen-ended game, and the secret of the game is knowing yourself, the cosmos, andthe method of its expression (otherwise known as the magickal link or, in theexample above, the bus). Although there are problems with the real-world applications of this thinking(as there are in any utopia, from Robert Owen to Karl Marx to B. F. Skinner), itcan be seen as doable. It does not prescribe a religion, a moral code, or anauthoritarian government. It recognizes divination as the ruling force of theuniverse (knowing your hidden secrets and the hidden secrets of the universe).It emphasizes practicality (you take the bus, you don’t expect to fly), and itrecognizes the ambitions and Wills of others; where would Mr. Smith be if Mr.Kramden didn’t have the Will to make a living and drive the bus? This model addresses greed, short-sightedness, and stupidity, but it also makesa stab at addressing these things by training. It probably does not work well inthe real world, but few models do. Every human could do this. It fulfills the reality tunnel of Crowley’sProtestant upbringing. (All Magi have to fulfill the Law that brought them intobeing, even as they have to proclaim a new Law.) In the Protestant (actuallyCampbellite) schema the grace of God was bestowed on hard-working,hard-believing men and women. “God helps those who help themselves.” InCrowley’s schema the grace of God (your higher Self) is bestowed onhard-working, hard-believing you. Crowley could say of Thelema, the Law is for all. We would agree and accept this Law, the Law for All, as far as it goes. We couldsay that such a world would be more attuned to magick, vast resources and toolswould be developed for personal psychology, many neuroses would vanish, andindividuality would be cherished but not idolized. We wouldn’t adore peoplebecause they practiced their Will. However, the Setian Law brings discord. Xeper is the Law of the Elect. Here is how magick works (according to the Second Beast, Michael Aquino): Ms.Smith tires of having to be downtown every day at 2:00 p.m. The vague discomfortgathers into a single point of feeling and thought that causes her inner worldand (perhaps) the inner worlds of others to explode out into the cosmos as anidea—telecommuting. This does not fulfill the Will of others (Mr. Kramden maylose his job) and creates a matrix that empowers other Wills in ways that Ms.Smith may not think of (Ms. Chang makes a busload of money as a wireless networkinstaller). Here is how magick fails (according to the Second Beast): Ms. Jones tires of thedaily commute. She whines about it to everyone. Maybe she can marry a man whocan take her away from such necessities. Maybe the thirty bucks a week shespends on the lottery will take care of it. Eventually she loses her job, thusfulfilling her wish. Now what separates Ms. Smith and Ms. Jones? Is Ms. Smith just lucky or blessedby some god? No, Ms. Smith has learned a lesson: change happens throughimagination, discipline of mind, and action in the real world. Action is themagickal link, discipline is the realization that there are other Wills in theuniverse besides her own so she must respect and include them in her actions,and imagination is the gift of Set—the ability to go beyond being and nonbeing. The Law of the Elect would give us a world ruled by disciplined dreamers skilledin the political arts. They could bring into being things first in their ownminds and then in the world, and thus create a current of change that makesother dreamers have an easier time of changing the world. It can be seen that for the most part the Law of the Elect has shaped most ofhuman history. It only fails when the Elect become stupid because they havetaken away all resistance to their rule. (If Ms. Smith could order her slaves tocarry her to work, she won’t be creating telecommuting.) At first it would seem that these two Laws are opposed. Each in its extremeforms (anarchy and totalitarianism) leads to unhappiness, both for the elect andfor all. However, there is a secret between the two partners. If the Law for All is taught to all, but used as resistance to the Law of theElect, then the Elect have to keep their election by Working hard. Dreamerswould be respected, yet also seen as the pains in the butt we are. People wouldbe happier because they could enjoy a freer and more powerful world. Dreamerswould still be called on to dream, since their dissatisfaction would happen as aresult of the very streams of becoming that other dreamers had unleashed. As the one-hundredth anniversary of the Cairo Working comes up you mightconsider some of the following questions: * What kind of utopia could happen if the Law for All and the Law of the Elect came into being? * What should I be aware of in my political backyard? * What do I get out of trying to make things better for people yet unborn? * What magickal Workings have brought the existence of these two Laws into existence, and how have these Workings shaped me? * How are these Workings actions against the sun king, the anointed one (or to use Greek, the Christ)? * What nonmagickal, political bedfellows would I need to bring about a real new order? 7 image [images/00006.jpg] KINGS AND SLAVES In The Book of the Law are several references to kings and slaves. The ideascontained therein are useful to Setians, and I thought I would share my opinionson them as we approach the centennial of the Cairo Working. The Book tells kings not to force their will against another king, nor to judgethe kingship of a man by his raiment. It tells us that the “slaves shall serve.”And it gives us the advice, “As brothers fight ye!” This royal advice deals with three important issues for the initiate. It tellsof the power of expectations and of the nature of exchange with the æon. Ittells of the power of the æon. Last, it tells of the power of brotherhood. Let’slook at these ideas. The power of expectation is a magick that we often think of as a type of lesserblack magick. For example if you have had a bad experience dealing with a videostore, you come to think that all people who work at video stores are stupidjerks. Before you enter a video store you are ready to deal with stupid jerks.Sure enough, everyone inside treats you like they are stupid jerks. At least youexperience it that way, even if your cues don’t make them act that way. One dayit occurs to you (i.e., your spouse suggests) that if you decided that thepeople inside the store were friendly and efficient, you would have a bettertime. In fact, people might even be friendly. You try it once or twice and, lo,it is true! Given that example, what if you treat people that you meet as though they weresecretly Setians? Assume that they’re smart, have a deeper side, and are inaccordance with the Word of Xeper, but they can’t discuss religion with you orsay the “S” word. Behold, people can be as smart as you let them be. Oh, sure,there are still jerks in the world and dummies, but probably not as many as youthink. You are also opening a door to the power of our æon; you are giving people amoment to think clearly—not by shocking them, just by being. If you have yourmind open to meeting kings, you may well meet kings in the oddest places but thebest of times. But what of slaves? Who are they anyway? When people receive a great wish andreject it they become slaves. They are in magickal debt to the world but tooscrewed up to pay back that debt. So they become thieves or ankle biters. Anklebiters are that class of individual who seek to discredit you by telling peopleabout you. They are dedicated to hurting you, and may well do so. However, theyalso become tools of the æon. One of the greatest recruiters for the Temple ofSet has been Geraldo Rivera. Thieves abound. They steal what you have createdand pass it off for their own. They do hurt your pocketbook and your ego. Thetemple has had its goods stolen this way a dozen times, and some of its ideas ina watered-down form are given to people a little less sharp than us. It is avery small bit of social alchemy, but it works for our benefit, and we usuallyget the smarter members of the knockoffs. The æon uses those who are attractedto it but have burned out their receptors. Last, let’s look at the power of brotherhood. Initiates will come into conflictas they develop their Will and discover their identity. However, if theinitiates as a body understand that they can engage in competitions to betterthe school, all win. The school as a whole gets not only better methods but alsoa stronger magickal link for its magickal technologies. If the initiates decideto test their Wills against each other by destroying others’ dreams andprojects, the school loses, and all things enchanted by the school are slowlyunbound. Kings in alliance rule the world. All of these practices increase the power of the group that practices them. Beon the lookout for friends, and our magick will be on the lookout for enemies toput to work. As our influence grows more people work with us within, seek uswithout, and the “slaves shall serve.” A good political study of this idea isJames Wasserman’s The Slaves Shall Serve: Meditations on Liberty (published in2004 by Sekmet Books), which deals with applications of the notions of MagiThomas Jefferson and Aleister Crowley in regard to American politics post-9/11.Jefferson, who would not have considered himself a magickian, is a great exampleof a Magus. By proclaiming a Word (in this case let us say it was Liberty), hechanged the way the world thinks and created a body of work for future men andwomen to draw on to change both themselves and the world. 8 image [images/00006.jpg] EGO AND ITS OPPOSITE I would like to examine the secret of opposites, which is so prevalent inCrowley’s work, by using his concepts of ego and egolessness as examples. The First Beast inspired many fictional doubles, and I would like to look at twoof them. Somerset Maugham created the character of Oliver Haddo for his novelThe Magician out of meeting Crowley. Haddo is engaged in a Working of hugeegotism; he is making clones, a race of little Olivers, but they aren’t comingout so well. This is not an unfit description of Crowley, who based many of therituals of his magickal orders on himself. For example many rituals involvefacing Crowley’s little vacation cabin at Loch Ness. Anyone who works with hissystem for very long at all restructures the universe inside his or her head tolook like the universe in Crowley’s head. A different look at Crowley is found in Michael Aquino’s The Dark Side(available on Aquino’s website; see “Resources and Suggested Reading”). Aquinoremade Crowley into an Obi-Wan Kenobi–like figure. This Obi-Wan regrets that hetreated his order with too much compassion, which is why it failed and theydied. At first this does not look too much like Uncle Al. Yet both of these interpretations are utterly correct. Both deal with the secretof apparent duality. Almost any idea that humans hold is actually a spectrum. Ifyou hold on to the idea of ego, you hold on to its destruction. Consider someone so greedy for fame that she obtains her wish, the star whocan’t leave her home without being mobbed. Her lifework wish has been granted;she is the most famous person ever, and now there is no “her.” My local grocerystore at the time of this writing is displaying no less than four magazinesconcerned with the break-up of J-Lo and Ben. Now I am not 100 percent sure whoJ-Lo is, yet I know she left him because of his gambling. It would seem there isno self called J-Lo, and that random people in a grocery store hold her deepthoughts and feelings. Crowley gave himself away. Every thought, every feeling, every magickaldiscovery. There are people on every continent that know more about Crowley thanCrowley did. He mapped out everything for them. They don’t have to travel toChina, Ceylon, or Mexico; learn Greek, French, Latin, and Hebrew; have bad loveaffairs; found their own religious retreats and communes; or invoke theAbramelin spirits. Heck, they don’t even have to think. He gave everything that was his: property, health, happiness, privacy. So onecould either see him as an egomaniac or the most selfless saint of all time. If one can see him as both, one learns the lesson of opposites. Human beingsdeal with poles of thought and feeling. If you go to one extreme, you willmanifest the other. For example if you are lying in a hospital bed, you might seem powerless, yetthousands of dollars of equipment are at your command, people surround you tocater to your whims, relatives and friends who haven’t thought of you for yearsare flying in to see you, and suddenly everything you say is listened to. Giving yourself away to the world does not ensure immortality of yourself. Itensures that an image of yourself is immortal. (In the terminology of Egyptianfriends, you are of djet rather than neheh.) The Egyptians divided time intoflavors—Djet was the unalterable past—a linear time concept ruled by Osiris, theneter of death. Neheh was the unfolding future conceived of as a spiral, ruledby Set-Heh or the “Eternal Set.” The future kills the past every day. It cuts itinto pieces, but the past creates the heroes that challenge the turbulence ofthe future. Crowley is an idol because he chose to become an idol. If we want to make use ofhis ideas, we have to reanimate him; but then St. John already explained that tous in his bestselling book, Revelations. Power by becoming an idol is a formula of the Æon of Horus, which reintroducedsun kings to the world. The Hor chieftains of Egypt have a lot in common withmedia whores. Now one may ask what is the other end of the pole called Xeper. Oddly enoughCrowley answered that in his tarot. The eighteenth card, the moon, signifiesdelusions, but Crowley (by his own words) portrayed the counterpart of delusion,the force of the god Khephra. Coming into being, taking something from thesubjective realm to the objective, is the other end of the pole. There is agreat wisdom in this; on the one hand the more that a Setian makes of herself,the more dreamy she becomes, the more detached from the world. As objectivepower increases, subjectivity likewise grows. Crowley connects this with themoon, the number 18, and the letter “Qoph” (rather similar to Coph, the Word ofthe Double-Wanded One in The Book of the Law). “Dreams made real” is theopposite pole of “dreams that dissolve the Self.” The more real you become, thegreater your power to become unreal. It is sad but true, and it is the oppositeof the dilemma of “fame of self ” that equals “erasure of Self.” 9 image [images/00006.jpg] POWER OF PROPHECY Crowley identified himself as the “prophet” of the Æon of Horus. This term nodoubt rankles Setians, who distrust the machinery of Judaism and Christianity.However, there is power in prophecy that can aid in one’s coming into being.Let’s look at the theory and practice of prophecy. A prophet need not be a Magus. The prophet need not declare Law, but his or herprophecy is in service of a Law. The Magus need not be a prophet, but there isinherently an act of prophecy in the Magus’s utterance, “Someday my Law willrule.” This can be seen either as the realm of propaganda or the magickal art ofprophecy. The art of prophecy has been with mankind for all of recorded history, but themyth of the prophet comes from Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The prophet issomeone who by the power of the transmission he or she receives becomes a(reluctant) leader. He understood that the prophet was a suffering human whowishes unity with the god so that he no longer suffers. Prophets have greatneed, and the sense of the mission they receive makes their suffering not onlybearable, but also actually begins to open doors for them. The prophet needs four things: respect, accuracy, belief in the power of thesecret, and the ability of essence transfer. Essence transfer or barakah is agift or energy of spiritual nature. The feeling you may have in the presence ofa lover, a favorite teacher, or a wise leader—the feeling that you can doanything—is because of essence transfer. To obtain these powers, the prophetmust experience Xeper, and by using these powers the prophet can remanifest. The prophet needs respect. Very few people stop and listen to a street preacher.Fewer people listen with their hearts to someone who can simply enforce his Willby position. Prophets have to establish themselves as important in an area justoutside of conventional society. They are neither above nor below the peoplethey are speaking to. They need attention-getting devices; outsiders are merelyoutsiders unless they can demonstrate something the world wants (e.g., magickalpowers, secrets to success in business or battle, etc.). The prophet must transform himself, much as a lover must transform himself, tobe attractive in the eyes of the public. The prophet must connect his teachingwith some existent body of lore, and with an existing tradition, becausetradition grants enough respect to overcome the outsider status. Only anoutsider can change the unfolding of the future because he stands outside thestream (and can dig new canals, build dams, etc.). The prophet must, however, beable to use the codes (e.g., language, dress, custom, etc.) of the host culturefor those times when he needs to apply a specific force to it. The prophet needs accuracy. Prophecy isn’t a crystal-ball gazing that reports onthe future in the same way. We tend to fall into that belief because we fail tounderstand that biblical prophecies were (for the most) part written after theevent had taken place in the objective world, as are most tales of ancientoracles. The prophet’s job is to pull an event into being by public utterance.As magickians we know that events seldom happen as we think they will, but theyalmost always happen as we expect them to. For example, you do an operation toallow you to speak to a certain person. You get to their performance, andsecurity keeps everyone a mile away. Later you wind up seated next to thatperson on a plane for four hours. Prophets are magickians who work publicly. Ifthe prophet’s wishes come true in this manner, he will gain fame and people willread and listen to his yet-to-be manifested Words. The prophet knows the power of the secret. Human beings are possessed of a forcethat generates consciousness. It has been working for millennia, making humansmore capable of thought and feeling and magick. It is a secret (or hidden) forceand responds well to things couched in secret terms. Humans possessed of thisforce like secret things. The prophet knows (on a conscious or unconsciouslevel) that people will be drawn to his or her utterances. As the people try tomake sense of these utterances, they will be manifesting the prophet’s Will. Atfirst this will be a subjective process, but as we know, subjective processesare complemented by objective ones. The opportunities for doing the prophet’sWill will open to those who decipher his secrets. The prophet also knows thathumans who believe they possess a secret feel empowered and lucky. (This is whymany people buy magickal talismans they cannot understand or impart the idea ofluck to chance phenomena.) Therefore the prophet gives power to those who woulddivine and manifest his Words. The magickian who wants to practice prophecyshould leave something mysterious. Prophets establish lines of prophets through essence transfer. The work ofprophets lies beyond their lifetimes. If they had no interest beyond theirlifetimes, they would be better served by avoiding prophecy and attending totheir current life needs. The three needs outlined above are the vehicle forthis process. Prophets become important only in a tradition. Not only do theyhave ties in their work to the past, they must also set up connections for theirheirs. Their words and works must be updated, and the rub of it is that theycannot judge those who will take their place after they are gone. They can picka successor while they live, but it must be up to forces they put in motion inthe objective universe to find the one to pull fresh fever from the skies. To achieve these aims the prophet must on the one hand be practical andbusiness-like and on the other as true as possible to the Words he receives. It took Crowley five years to come to obey the Words he had received. It tookyears to gain enough respect through writing and infamy to complete the task hehad prophesied for himself. Crowley took the grade of Ipsissimus in 1921 (fivenine-year cycles to the beginning of our æon). Need brings Words when human teachers fail; we see that both in the CairoWorking and the Santa Barbara Working. Prophecy unifies the prophet with thegod, but fleetingly, as such unions would ultimately mean the death of theprophet; however, they give him a mission. The Words uttered in prophecy havethe power to give the reader or auditor the same union, fleetingly. If theprophet has fulfilled the requirements, both his Will and the Will of the godwill remain on Earth, generating their own caretakers, heirs, and renewers. 10 image [images/00006.jpg] MAGI OF THE Aimage [images/00004.jpg]Aimage [images/00004.jpg] In Liber CXI, the Beast 666 gives us some examples of Magi and their Words andformulas as part of his instruction to his magickal son. The first reading maydelude the reader into thinking that this is a sort of history lesson, chosenrandomly from real-world events. A closer reading reveals that these “Magi” are not listed in a historical order,and in fact some of them are not human beings at all. Crowley is describing theprocess of initiation using a mixture of historical personages and myths. Iwould like to look at his description and offer some of its implications. Unlike Crowley we live in a multicultural world that does not have the greatstream of Western thought as its idol, so we are unaware of the broadness of histhinking by beginning with a Chinese sage and including Arabs, Egyptians, Jews,Indians, and so forth. We are unaware that his Working has (in part) made suchmulticulturalism possible (and are more likely to ask why he left out women). Crowley’s list is as follows: Lao-tsu, Gautama, Krishna and Dionysus, Thoth,Moses, Mohammed, and (of course) Crowley. Let’s consider the first seven in thislist. Lao-tsu, whose name translates as “Aged Master,” is the legendary author of theTao Te Ching (Way of Change), which he wrote down while waiting to leave Chinafor the barbarous West astride an ox. China, like Mesopotamia, was a divinatorysociety. All decisions tended to come from a classic oracular work, the I-Ching(Book of Change). Lao-tsu’s book is a philosophical guide to the universe theI-Ching describes. The world is in constant flux, but its parts seek to be inbalance; people who are likewise in balance rule and prosper. Lao-tsu describeshow to achieve such a dynamic balance: (1) there is a way, and it existseternally; (2) the way that can be taught will bring you misery because itteaches you a false model of the cosmos; (3) if you pledge yourself to improvethe cosmos and accept that the cosmos is improving you, all is well and evenmisfortune furthers you; and (4) you may obtain special powers as did others whohave found the way before you. Lao-tsu is the image of the initiate beginningher journey; the story of the trip to the West is of course emblematic ofbreaking with the social order. In the legend of Lao’s life, he had been anarchivist. Confucius had come to him seeking knowledge of ancient rituals andwas told that such things are mere dust and words do not hold the answer. Laoalso teaches therefore that texts are not a key to wisdom. His image of the sageis not one of a learned man whom everyone consults but of someone who may seem afool or simpleton because of his single-minded pursuit of the way. In thepolitical implications of the Tao, Lao’s pupil Chung-tze pointed out that thebest rulers make no name for themselves and are almost invisible. Again theseare models for how the serious initiate both appears to and changes the world. According to Liber CXI Gautama, whom we call the Buddha (or the Awakened),uttered “Anatta,” which is a Pali word meaning “soullessness.” This may seem anodd word to an immortality-seeking initiate, however, we are familiar with itslesson via Plato’s cave analogy. According to legend Gautama was brought up tobe the world’s greatest warrior-prince. His parents tried to make sure that hehad no knowledge of disease, old age, poverty, or death. The forces that awakenhumans, however, gave him glimpses of these realities that placed him on thepath. One of his teachings is that there is no continuity in the outer world(anicca), no perfection in any realm (durkha), and no continuity in the thoughtworld (anatta). The self that had been built for young Gautama was no real Self;it could be destroyed by a single scene from objective reality. The selves webuild every day are likewise unreal and subject to destruction if we either seek(or are sought by) the forces of initiation. The person who describes himself asa life insurance salesman will, like Willy Loman, have that reality removed.Likewise, the lover, the son, even the Setian will have that base of seemingbeing taken from him. What’s left, the observing mind, does not (according toclassic Buddhism) reincarnate in a more or less meritorious station of life, andit does not go to a heaven or a hell, but it comes into being again whenconditions matching its essence reoccur in the random process of the universe.This twofold removal of the “laws” of karma and the reality of the social selfwas Gautama’s strike against Hinduism (by the way, this is why he chose Pali forhis scriptures instead of the holy language of Sanskrit). There was nojustification that was inherent by being born a Brahman, nor did losing yourjob, marriage, or village mean anything to the reality behind you. The real youis drawn by the spell of attraction that certain physical and mental processesweave. If you dis-identify with your “life” and cease living that life forrewards in another life, you awaken; that is to say the observing and namelessmind turns upon itself as the object of its contemplation. This aspect of theBuddha’s teachings is a little too rough for popular Buddhism, but then the Wordworlds are not where we live most of the time. We seldom live in perfectawareness and Will that the Words create. Christians fall short of Agape,Thelemites fall short of Thelema, Setians of Xeper—all humans have their bettermoments, and the Words are ladders to those moments. The great magickian stillhas to do his laundry, fry his catfish, and darn his socks: even if (at hisbest) he is a philosopher king. Dionysus (“god of Nyssa”)—who is born on December 25, dies on March 22, and isreborn on March 25 of every year—was a typical eleutherios (savior) god. LikeKrishna (“the Black”) he had been imported into an Indo-European pantheon. Bothof these gods attract bed partners (Krishna once made love to sixteen thousandwomen at the same time and played a flute while doing so) and humans and demonsthat try to kill them. That Crowley took the placard from Christ’s cross, whichread “INRI” (standing for “Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews”), and made itthe Word of Krishna and Dionysus shows initiates four things: (1) first, theyare spiritually elect (the incarnation or the son or daughter of a god); (2)they are from humble origins (initiates tend not to come from wealthy,well-adjusted families, but are self-made); (3) they give ecstasy to thosearound them; and (4) they undergo trials that make them stronger. INRI has beeninterpreted in many ways by Western magick: Isis is the ineffable queen ofnature, fire renews all of nature, letters reveal secret meanings, and more.About a minute and a Google search will give you many more Latin mottos. Thesegods were obviously not speaking in Latin acronyms, and Crowley chose thesealternate meanings to break any of his readers’ habits of returning toChristianity any time they were close to a breakthrough. The idea that we createour subjective past (“I am the son of a god”) is a much better use than whatsociety would teach us (“you are born of sin”). The initiate must transcend hispast because his state of being will attract certain people in transition whoneed ecstasy and he will attract forces that will punish him. If he accepts the“death” that society will put him through, he will become much stronger. This isnot the life of simple progress. The idea that magickians will have an easy goof it is not in this formula, nor is the notion that being “awakened” will letyou see and avoid all problems. Thoth, the Egyptian god of writing (and therefore of magick), came to beconsidered not only the prototype of Hermes by the Greeks, but also the authorof the tarot by Europeans about the time of the American Revolution. Crowleyassigned to him the word amoun, signifying the god Imen (“the Hidden”). Theinitiates who come to see the way that exists, that their observing mind is notthe same thing as the socially constructed self, and to accept the ordeals thatsociety places on those of a self-chosen higher nature can learn to order theirdestiny. They can become like Imen, the Hidden God, whom you probably know asthe patron of Thebes (Amon). The mind that “does” magick is the observing mindthat the Buddha discovered. It is the mind that can do the first lesson that theworld makes us learn about magick—that you can take misfortune and turn it intoa strengthening of the force of mind. The Egyptians said that Re, the sun god,whose name means “the Creative,” gave magick to mankind to fend off problems.They were unique among people of the world in perceiving magick as a divine giftto mankind, as opposed to something given to the few or belonging to the godsthemselves. Crowley was unique in his synthesis in equating the observing mindof Buddhism with the mind that does magick. The mind that has been awakened to its proper subject (itself) and to its powerspeaks. It becomes the Speaker, or in Hebrew IHVH, which Crowley said was theWord of Moses. Moses, whose name of Egyptian origin means “he is born,” was theauthor of the Torah, the law of the Jews. The Speaker does two things ofexceptional power: he gives you success in battle, and he reveals his favor byhistorical events (as opposed to nonlinear recurring events). Success is thejudge. What you put in motion lives and thrives as opposed to those events thatbelong to the objective universe. If I say “People will read this book fordecades!” and it is so, I have shown that I can Work my Will in time. If on theother hand I prophesy “The moon will have more eclipses,” I have done nothingbut report on events unconnected with my Will. Jehovah (IHVH) gave his chosen people victory after victory against greater foesand punished them for lack of faith. The initiate needs merely to have absolutefaith in the voice that speaks from the awakened mind, saying, “I am that I am.”This voice can take the worst and weakest coward (whom we see in the mirrorevery day) and give him or her the promised land. The Word IHVH is the Word offaith with your own destiny. The historical effect of this Word on the Hebrewshas kept them alive despite millennia of persecution. It likewise preserves allwho keep faith in themselves. The next to the last step in Crowley’s chain is Mohammed. Crowley assigns himthe word Allah (written as “La Allh”). Mohammed became the agent of God onEarth. He created a faith based on conversion and universality. Any people maytake up Islam, and it is the duty of the adherents to spread the word and bystruggle ( jihad) to keep the faithful secure. Crowley proposed the spelling “LaAllh” (meaning “there is no god”) to suggest that the initiate must become theagent of initiation. It is his job to wake up Gautama, his duty to suggest toLao to give up the archiving job, his job to buy Krishna his flute, his job tohelp Moses leave the land he was born in. The forces of initiation are not agrace from a god looking out for mankind; these forces must be exercised byhumans on humans: Lao-tze must write his book, Buddha must preach his sermon atDeer Park, and so on. The eternal way does not seek you; it is you who must giveit to others to cancel out the debt of your receiving of it. There is no god toteach others. There is no one but you. The Great Beast encoded a methodology in these seven entities that made possibleThelema. Will does not exist without these steps, and by understanding thesesteps the members of his magickal order could use the materials created bymankind for purposes finer and stronger than the purposes of those whoostensibly follow these teachers. 11 image [images/00006.jpg] SET AND SHT The First Beast claimed that all of the magickal force of his æon was held inSet, Shaitan, or Satan. He symbolized this force with the word ShT, Shin Teth,which he counted as 31, from its tarot values. Shin is XX, tarot trump “TheÆon,” and Teth is XI, Lust. Æon (20) plus Lust (11) equals 31 Crowley’s numberfor the Divine in action. Many Setians encounter this symbolism and just think, “Yeah. It’s the devil.”But let’s look a little deeper at this idea. Let’s consider Set when he washidden by the Æon of Horus. Crowley viewed the cosmic process and the individual process as identical, sinceon the one hand the cosmos contains the individual (you are in the universe),and on the other hand the individual contains the cosmos (the universe is inyour head). The source of the world’s progress is (sadly) mainly war and aggression. War andthe threat of war have funded the sciences and technology, created entiredisciplines of psychology and medicine, and built bridges, railroads, and dams;the dark power is the shaping power. ShT is lord. The source of much of the world’s movement is lust. Lust sells cars, createsmarriages and babies, and can be sublimated by those black magickians we calladvertisers. The flow of goods comes from lust, and we remake ourselves toincite lust in others. The force of lust drives our world. ShT is lord. Satan must be below the magickian creating the world he can express his Willinto. The forces that individuate us are “evil” forces. Most people create their firstSelves to deal with a bad situation, the death of a parent, the loss of a home,or the loss of their first boyfriend or girlfriend. These Selves aren’t usuallyvery well made, but they are the forces that awaken us to the need to createourselves out of the materials of our life. Initiation is forced on us by thedark forces, not the sweet, kindly ones. ShT is lord. The forces that hide secrets from us until we are ready are dark forces. Withoutan internal darkness to overcome, we would be a mass of chaos having access toall parts of our psyche at the same time. We are made strong and wise enough touse our powers just at the right time that we (re)gain access to them. The darkforces rule revelation. ShT is lord. Satan must be above us, shaping us to receive the universal Will. “Sh” is the letter of fire, specifically the divine fire, which does not consumebut says, “I am that I am,” or less poetically, “Individuality exists by cosmicnecessity.” Crowley did foresee the black flame that the Second Beast was fatedto draw down from Heaven in Revelation 13:13. “Sh” is the æon, because the æonis the all-encompassing viewpoint that changes everything to its benefit. It isthe fire that makes gold, and it is the fire that proclaims the individual. Theæon is a memory of the soul awakened by the Word. It is a memory of anotherworld, a promised land; once awakened the mind will work toward what the soulremembers. But the memory is not enough. “T” is the letter of the serpent, the force in the world. It is lust in itspurest form, a force that obliterates the false ego yet does not touch the Self.It is the force that can make you fall in love at the wrong time with the rightperson. It can make you see visions and have trances just as you are gettingready to get along with your life as a stockbroker. It can make you paintpaintings, sculpt, write poetry—or gamble away your life savings, drive drunk,or shoplift on a whim. The two, combined in Crowley’s system, produce the Working of magick. You have felt this Work in you. Every one of you has that story that begins, “I started talking to this guy; Idon’t really know why,” or, “I went into this bookstore and picked up this book;I had never really thought about it before.” ShT is lord. Great is the might of Set; greater still he through you. This is how he appears in the Æon of Horus. With the number 31 he is equal toAL, the god of faith that makes all things happens. He is the Working part ofthe one mind. He is equivalent to LA, the no-god of nonbeing, the shimmeringall-potential that flows as energy into this universe but is beyond thedistinction of Self and non-Self. We do not see AL and LA this way. In our æon AL is the god that makes you thepromise that you will achieve a better state than you have now, that you arestronger than you know, and that by holding to him you will be transformed atthe moment of challenge into a vessel of his Will. We just don’t think that ALis outside of you, we also think that you are AL, that the universe inside yourhead is your universe, and that you have the ability to lead yourself through itif you can hear your voice. So ShT is the force that helps you find you. Setiangreater black magick will reveal to you the forces you need to know yourself atthe right time. ShT is the gate, and in this we can agree with the First Beastthat ShT is the concentration of magick and the equal to the god that is youbecause ShT is as big as you can perceive him to be, and the more you can seethe more magick you can do. We do not see LA as nonbeing. We see it as something closer to the ginn of theancient Germans or the maya of the Hindus. It is the vast force that comes intothe universe all the time. It is the force that sustains galaxies, makes thequantum weirdness possible in your head so that you can think, and gives thepossibility of possibility to every creature that is touched of ShT. LA is auniverse of forces that can be manipulated by the magickian. It is as big anduseful as you perceive it to be. Many of the magickians who work with LA havenames like Wright, Edison, and Tesla. So LA is equal to ShT. Without thepotential of the objective universe the transforming force of magick would benothing but a way to amuse the mind. If no change is ever made in the world, theamusement wears thin and the mind loses its edge. So LA is the equal of AL andof ShT and together they are the components of Will. The three words that createthe 93 current, LA, AL, and ShT, are all worth 31 by gematria; in Crowley’ssystem they are the same on the deepest level. Together the three yield 93, thenumber of Thelema (and Agape and Nike/Victory). • A Self that creates the world by drawing itself together to super-awareness,then expands into all levels of the cosmos and uses what it finds there toimprove itself: AL (the Kabbalistic god). • A transforming force that has magick and lust, strife and darkness, revelationand the ability to “get outside of the game”: ShT. • A rush of energy always coming into the world that the magickian can shape ashe or she wishes; the universe has a similar process for the individual, so asindividuals we don’t have to come up with all of that energy on our own: LA. AL + ShT + LA = 31 + 31 + 31 = 93 > It can be Will THELEMA> It can be loving the Other to be transformed AGAPE > It can be Victory NIKE > It can be seeking the Mysteries REYN TIL RUNA (In rune tally, the Law reyn til runa, written in the runes of the YoungerFuthark, adds to 93 and is 11 letters long!) So we don’t think that the expansive processes of the universe are the same asours, but we think they are similar enough that we can impose our Will on them.We differ from Crowley in thinking that the universe inside our heads is thesame thing as the universe. He failed to see this and was blinded by unity, soalthough his soul told him Set was the teacher and giver of magick, he could nothear or say Set’s eternal Word. Now what is the use of this? Did I tell you this so that you can preach to yourThelemite friends and convert them to our fold? Did I tell you this so that youcan see how one Word leads to another Word, much as one Work leads to anotherWork? (Transformative knowledge is half the battle: “Sh.”) Did I tell you thisbecause it would be a good time to do an invocation of Set before an altar withthe XX and XI cards from the Crowley deck and ask for illumination about whatthose cards mean? Did I tell you this because the practical side of card XI willbe getting a boost on or near the anniversary of the Cairo Working of the FirstBeast? Did I tell you for a hidden reason? As a servant of darkness I have todeal with the hidden. "},{"pageContent":"The Fire 1 image [images/00007.jpg] NUIT Nuit is a third-generation Egyptian goddess. Her grandfather was Atum, whosename means both “perfection” and “nothingness.” His children were Shu, god ofair, sky, and intellect in its separating mode, and Tefnut, goddess of moisture,fog, and mind in its mode of connectedness and reintegration. Their childrenwere Geb, the dead god whose body is the Earth and who haunts the world as theElder Horus, and Nuit, the starry sky of night who gives birth to the sun everyday. The children of Geb and Nuit were the five gods of human consciousness:Osiris (Asar, literally “the Dead Man”), Isis (Aset, a pun for “Old Woman”), theElder Horus (meaning “the Far Off One,” god of chieftains), Set (meaning “theCutter,” in charge of cutting the umbilical cord and circumcision), and Nepthys(meaning “Lady of the House”; her actual name was reserved for cult members). Nuit, who spoke to Crowley in the first chapter of The Book of the Law, isprobably the best symbol for the universe inside our heads. The night sky is thekey to human evolution; in The Book of the Law this is summarized as “Every manand every woman is a star.” They are stars both in their own firmament and inthe universes inside other people’s heads. Now let’s think about the star ofyourself in your own universe. Your universe has a model of everything you knowplus space for everything that can be known. One of these things is yourself.You have a model of yourself, and it is the star shining in the dark of theunknown. As a magickian you know a secret that most people do not know: thismodel of yourself is not yourself. In fact your opinion of yourself is muchsmaller and much less important than your real Self. Your real Self is the wholeof your subjective universe. Crowley’s Self saw this as Nuit. Her symbol is apentagram (symbol of isolated intelligence) with a circle within it (symbol ofendless reintegration and renewal) colored red (symbol of life and thefeminine). There is no true name for Nuit. Crowley took the refrain in verseI-53 of The Book of the Law, “To me! To me!” as the Greek letters “TΩ μH,” TauOmega Mu Eta. According to Crowley this would read as “The Not,” which he punswith Nuit: a forced rhyme at best. His Greek is a tad forced. In Greek, “TΩ μH”means “a cutting,” indicating that the hidden message of The Book of the Law isabout the desirability of separation. Crowley’s “the not” is not a vacuum, a negative space, but rather a positivespace. You do not need special invocations or circumstances to experience thepositive wonder of star-spangled darkness. Any clear midnight far from the citywill suffice. The image that moves your soul because it reflects your soul wasmankind’s first magickal symbol. Its totality is without name, therefore it is“the not.” Her number is 418, Crowley’s symbol for the Great Work or theultimate changing of human perception into a godlike viewpoint. Nuit has the perfection and nothingness of her grandsire, and her stars sparklebecause of her father (indeed without the intellect of Shu she should be in anunproductive union with the Earth). She has the integrative powers of hermother; being a being so vast she levels the playing field (with joy and wonder)for those who gaze upon her. She is manifest in her children, especially Isis(particularly those parts of Isis that Dion Fortune called the Black Isis),Nepthys (who ruled over the practices of getting sprits to be incarnated inchildren), and Set (who is a constellation in her sky). Let us consider theinfluence of Nuit on the cosmos, the magick of Nuit, and the nature of herworship. Nuit touches all of the cosmos, not just the region between your ears or wrappedby your skin. She does not equal the cosmos, as the universe inside your head isnot the cosmos. The link between her and the cosmos is primarily through yourexperience (that synthesis of your reason, your received ideas, your culturalexperience, and your sensory data). But she is also in touch with the cosmos bya magickal link to it. This creates her great darkness, because these links arenot perceivable by you. This allows for human freedom. In other words the verylarge number of potential manifestations are held in that dark; some of them arethings that aren’t manifest in the macrocosmos yet. Since Nuit touches all ofthe cosmos, it touches and is touched by other people as well. From Nuit comessynchronicity as well as the discovery of things believed to be hidden or lost.The interactions of human psyches produce centers of initiation and world changeby setting the stage. All of the events that came to you in an unexpected waycame from Nuit. The Æon of Horus has seen a growing manifestation of Nuit in theworld by the creation of technologies that facilitate human interaction at adistance (such as the Internet) and also by the mass magickal action of spaceexploration. As mankind deals with the heavens, the primal symbol of all of us,even the least observant human becomes aware of Nuit. There are special magickal practices associated with Nuit. As changing herchanges the world, all magick comes through her. Magick performed at night has aspecial potency as it is easier for us humans to interact with the universeinside our heads by working inside of our most hallowed magickal symbol. Theother aspect of Nuit’s being is that forgetting your magickal work helps itsmanifestation. If the desired state is released from the part of you that glowswith consciousness, it will find its way to the darkness within you and begin toWork there (and on its counterpart in the physical universe). English tranceartist and occultist Austin Osman Spare was a master at this type of magick. The worship of Nuit comes in making her manifest. In this sense any work of artor magick is a form of worship of Nuit. Four forms in particular are nonharmfulto the magickian and bring a good connection with Nuit (as well as furtheringher presence in this world). These are alphabet and language magick,pyschographic magick, dreaming, and space gnosis. We’ll examine these brieflyand then discuss the results of the Working with Nuit. Alphabet and Language Magick Nuit is about unexpected manifestation. One of the ways this occurs is by takingelements apart and putting them together in new ways. It is no coincidence thatSir Flinders Petrie found the oldest alphabetic writing in the world at the timeof the Cairo Working and that it spelled Baalat, the name of a goddess. Letterstake on power and mystery because they can produce so many associations. ThatOdin glimpsed the runes after sacrificing self to Self is an example of theWorking of Nuit. That Austin Osman Spare created his alphabet of desire based onhis interactions with the dark within would be an example of the Working ofNuit. Likewise puns that can create unexpected thoughts and jar the mind are theWorkings of Nuit. One could count as her priests James Joyce (who saw her asAnna Livia Plurabelle) and Robert Anton Wilson. There is an even more powerful(although seemingly not as magickal) aspect to language Work. There are manyexamples of “female language” studies in the world. Women, unlike men, tend touse language for community forming rather than dominance games. Nuit comes intothe world to bring greater freedom (because it makes for more manifestation),and this will bring about the need for new methods of speaking. The politicaland power speech of the future belongs to women, and all magickians (regardlessof gender) need to learn and use this language. Psychographic Magick Nuit wants to know about herself. She wants a good model of herself insideherself. One of the best ways to honor her is to develop diagrams of the soulmodel of the universe. These mandalas and lamens become talismans as soon as youfinish drawing, painting, or etching them. Nuit may be the nothingness, the AinSoph, the nirvana, but she exists to discover herself. She feeds on models ofherself, and that need caused mankind to invent religions. Dreaming Dreaming is one of the best ways to worship Nuit. The universe inside your headis the repository of all of your past, all of the impersonal past that formedyou, and all of your imagination of the future. She does not hold the here andnow and is always modeling the here and now on her images. Your boss, is he likeyour dad? (So you dream of your dad at work.) Your brother? Your coach? DarthVader? Nuit is always trying to balance two subjective things—your memories andyour future or fantasy—with the objective thing of your daylight life. Bylearning how to communicate better with her, she can advise you on what seemsobscure in your current life, help you heal and discover your past so that youcan work on it in the here and now, and spot doorways into the future. Currentlya great deal of dream technology is being developed in the Temple of Set, andperhaps a future book may reveal these techniques. In the meantime there areuseful guides in the world, and your own experimentation will yield results. Space Gnosis Space gnosis is a great way to open not only yourself to Nuit, but to open yournonmagickal friends as well. All of the hard sciences, mathematics, and many ofthe social sciences are sacred to her, but space exploration is especially dear.Any time you interact with the night sky, whether it’s using a home telescope,giving computer time to the SETI Institute’s search for extraterrestrialintelligence, or naming a star after your beloved, you are paying the homage ofattention, awe, and respect to the outer symbol of the universe within you. Itis the desire to pay such homage that will actually lead mankind to the stars,which is the pragmatic reason we may give ourselves. Likewise it is that desireto look at the starry abyss and feel the positive presence of nothingness thatcauses many people to channel their subconscious (the dark of Nuit) aspresenting messages from a space brother, an angel on high, and so forth. Thisconfusion leads to the madness called popular occultism—a very exotic form ofsleep, but no better than the Sleep of the average man. Results of the Working with Nuit If you work to communicate with the universe inside your head, you willeventually come to a place of harmony with it. In Crowley’s system this meantyou dissolved your ego in the outer universe, becoming Nemo (Greek for“nobody”). Or you shut yourself away from the universe and became a blackbrother, the spiritual version of Howard Hughes in his later life. In the Templeof Set we contend that the harmony of the daylight Self and the vast expanse ofthe night sky Self is the master of the temple. The Masters must manifest theuniverse inside their heads. They are creators who create by sharing theirunderstanding. Like the drawing of the psychograph they feed the psyches ofthose around them. They must teach both in written form and mouth to ear. Deeplyconfident in their self-knowledge, their egotism fades. They don’t have toloudly proclaim who they are, they simply have to be. 2 image [images/00007.jpg] AIWASS Aiwaz, or Aiwass, the Holy Guardian Angel of Aleister Crowley, dictated The Bookof the Law to him in 1904. Crowley had inherited the idea of the Holy GuardianAngel from the Golden Dawn and ultimately from Abraham of Würzberg, an alchemistwho created The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage. The originalconcept goes back to the Zoroastrian Arda FravaÅ¡ (Holy Guardian Angels). Thisessay describes the nature of such beings. The word angel means “messenger.” One of the aspects of the Age of Aquarius, ofwhich Crowley was one of the heralds, is that the intermediary entity betweenthe divine and the human has become important. This is obvious in its crudestform in the growing angel cult of the Christians. The Holy Guardian Angel existsto prevent the stratification of the soul that was the formula of the Æon ofOsiris and the Age of Pisces. The formula of the age was to create a god in theimage of all that was good in a person (some amalgam of the good and theculturally appropriate) and then live in fear, dread, and guilt of that image.As the notions of the good became more unified, mankind moved from many gods toone. The Catholic Church developed the cult of the Holy Guardian Angel tofulfill a psychological need. It may be hard to assume that the supreme lord ofthe universe is watching out for you, but it’s nice to think that someone is.The Holy Guardian Angel keeps your divine aspirations from drifting too far awayfrom the day-to-day world you live in and becoming an absent god that thundersdown judgment on you. Two things are needed to communicate with the Angel. First, you must practiceself-inquiry, honest self-assessment. Then you have something as a basis ofcommunication. The best method for this is the magickal diary and the use of theexercise of Philo of Alexandria wherein you review the day’s events in reverseorder to see what ethical precepts you may have broken. Second, you must inflameyourself with the notion of possibility. You must allow yourself on a deep levelto believe that magick is possible and most importantly that you are a wondrousbeing unknown to yourself. These two paths, which may be manifest in manydifferent ways, can invoke the Holy Guardian Angel. You simply need to know thatyou should invoke often, as it is not an easy aspect of yourself to awaken. The powers of the Holy Guardian Angel are four: divine communication, advice,knowledge and power over the cosmos, and the teaching of self-love. Divine communication will allow you to consult your evolving ethical standardsand take your philosophical goodness into real-world good. Divine communicationwill also allow you to see the bigger picture of your evolving goals. This iscommunication with AL, the nature of which is that you become overpowering inthat nothing can stand in your way. The Holy Guardian Angel has the power to correlate all the information in yoursubjective universe. As such it is the best oracle you can ever hear. It doesnot have objective knowledge of the universe, but it knows more than any onepart of you. It can keep you from making a decision based on just your prick,just your logic, just your social duties, and so on. The Holy Guardian Angel is a filter of the signals you get. The average humanreceives one million signals per second from his or her nervous system. The HolyGuardian Angel picks those that are magickally meaningful. Magickians do nothave more synchronicities than other people, they merely observe them. Thesemeaningful coincidences help you map your subjective universe, and they alsoallow you to Work your Will on the objective universe through the magickal link.If your Work as a magickian becomes transpersonal, these synchronicities can beshared with others as places their magick will Work. (This is becoming thefather.) Thus the Holy Guardian Angel gives you power over and knowledge of thesubjective universe. Most important, the Holy Guardian Angel teaches you the power of self-love. Onceit sinks into the depths of your being that all of your magick comes from lovingyourself, you will cultivate that love. The insults of others will cease to harmyou, and you will develop the power of pardon to such an extent that you canundo the effects of past misdeeds. Eventually you will be able to direct thestream of good fortune to those who need it. 3 image [images/00007.jpg] ANKH-EF-EN-KHONSU One of the magickal triggers of the Cairo Working was a painted Egyptian funeralstele of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty belonging to Ankhef-en-Khonsu. Crowley hadprepared for the sort of contact that he received from such forms ofcommunication. The name Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu means “may he live as the traveler.” Crowley hadalready been attracted to the idea of travel through Shelley’s poem “Alastor.”Khonsu was the Theban moon god, who had taken the place of Montu as the son ofAmun and Mut. Montu, the warrior god of Thebes, was in decline by theTwenty-fifth Dynasty, and Ankh-efen-Khonsu was one of his last priests. Montuhad absorbed the Cult of Set in the Twenty-second Dynasty. Khonsu was a healinggod, and he was a god that helped you find out what you wanted to be or do inthe world under his title of “arranger of destinies,” as well as under his name,which in Egyptian means “traveler” or “pathfinder.” He was associated with thegods Re and Thoth. Choosing the name of the god of the rival cult had to be adeliberate choice, a sending toward the recurrent future (in Egyptian, neheh).Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu chose two spells from the most famous of afterlife books, TheBook of Coming Forth by Day, to be painted on the back of his stele. This wasalso unusual in that the back of the stele was usually left blank. The spellswere numbers 2 and 30. Thirty (especially in its second form, whichEgyptologists number as 30b) was the most popular spell of ancient Egypt,inscribed on countless scarabs. It tells the ib, or heartmind, not to speakagainst the deceased. It is a spell of hadith, to get the recording entity toemphasize why the dead man should continue. The second spell allows the spiritof the dead man to visit the Earth unhampered by such the forces that live hereand to perform his Will among the living. The Egyptians invested a good deal of time becoming known as the wonder workersof the ancient world. In late antiquity, as the Roman Empire withdrew funds fromthe temple schools, Egyptian priests immigrated to Italy and Greece and setthemselves up as magickians, their scrolls forming the basis of European magickbooks. Their magickal reputation (enhanced by biblical references) made Egyptseem the mother of magickians. This led to various revivals of Egyptian magick,including Count Alessandro di Cagliostro’s Egyptian Masonry, the first synthesisof European guild mysteries with Egyptian themes, and the deification of Osirisin such rites. This idea found its way to the Golden Dawn and hence to Crowley. Crowley himself prepared for the contact in three ways. First, his mother haddubbed him the Beast 666, so when Rose found the stele numbered 666, he wasready for the news. Many of our important magickal workings happened earlier inour gene line. Second, he had joined the Golden Dawn, which had inheritedTheosophy’s tradition of the hidden chiefs, beings who influenced the evolutionof mankind, so he had a slot in his psyche for such communication. Third, he hadbeen introduced to an early translation of the Spell of the Headless One, whichenabled a magickian to obtain an audience (and momentary union) with a god. Thisspell was the method of contacting Ra-Hoor-Khuit. Crowley had been seekingcommunication, so he was receptive when it came. This exchange between the past and the present produces two profound effects inthe psyche of the communicant. First, it experientially reveals to him or herthat body life is not soul life. This simple truth, in and of itself, is almostenough to ensure immortality. The second effect is that possibility and purposeare infused in the soul of the receiver. He or she knows that things are not aswe have been taught by other humans to believe and that the believer must shareknowledge. Sadly most such communication happens to people who are receptive butnot prepared to deal with the material, and so it becomes UFO ranting, Lemurianchanneling, and so forth. Many people who do prepare their minds well enough aretoo addicted to their self-image to be receptive. Being open to but not“believing in” such communication is an important part of Crowley’s system. Theproof of the communication lies in the power, happiness, and wisdom it bringsyou. Crowley’s interaction with Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu led him to see the afterlife aspotentially active and to see that his role was to remove the idea of “eternalrest.” 4 image [images/00007.jpg] THE LORD OF SILENCE The Lord of Silence, Ra-Hoor-Khuit, is the speaker and audience of the thirdchapter of The Book of the Law. The name shows a unified form of Ra, the supremedeity of the gods, who one could easily say is the god of the idea of godhood,and Horus, the living form of god incarnated as the pharaoh, who one couldeasily say is the god of the idea of humanhood, and khuit, a word meaning“immortalizing forces feminine.” In short (s)he is the perfect union of thefirst two forces and the divine counterpart of who Aleister Crowley was tobecome. He is also the Master magickian of the gods. Crowley identified him withthe Greco-Egyptian god Harpocrates. Let’s look at the five aspects—Lord ofSilence, Ra, Horus, khuit, and Harpocrates—and see what ideas hold as prototypesfor the initiate. The Lord of Silence is experienced by everyone and forgotten at the moment ofthe experience. Perhaps you were in a fight with your significant other andwhile you babbled on, an inner voice said, “You’re being a jerk, right now.” Orperhaps you were weaseling out of speaking up when a coworker was beingcriticized, and that inner voice said, “You should speak.” This is the Lord ofSilence. It is the part that filters the better part of the one mind and thebetter part of your unique Self, but often does not have the power to act. It isseldom heard, hard to hear, and the voice of the Will. If you learn to let itspeak, it will make you the kingly man. For example, if you can perfectly relax,turn off the internal dialogue, and then say in a loud voice a wish, that wishis always granted. You will find that true silence will purge you of falsedesires. Most of the magickal methodology associated with Carlos Castaneda isassociated with getting to the Lord of Silence. Ra was more than just the sun god. Egyptian theologians promoted him twice. Inthe Fourth Dynasty he became the supreme god of the pantheon and the divinecounterpart of the pharaoh. His symbol was the “horizon,” which architecturallywas the pyramid. In November of the year before the Cairo Working, Crowley didan invocation for Rose’s amusement in the King’s Chamber of the Cheops Pyramid,which produced a flood of light as bright as moonlight inside the chamber,establishing his link to Ra. Ra’s second promotion came during the RamessideDynasties (the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties). During this time Ra wasgiven seventy-two forms and was seen as the god behind the gods. His variousdivine hypostases included Sia, divine intelligence; Hu, divine utterance;Sekhmet, divine (female) power; and Maat, divine (female) connective justice.When his boat passed through the underworld, the dead came alive for hisjudgment. In short he was the point where energy flowed into the cosmos; he wasthe god maker. Thoth was said to have two supreme spells; one of them allowedhim to see Ra no matter where he was. Ra represents that conscious andpreconscious part of humans that makes gods. He represents that part of humansthat allows them to enliven and interact with the dead. He is the creator ofmagick. He is the indefinable part of humans that creates all of the divine andnamable parts. In Setian theology he would be the gift of Set. If one had theperceptions of Ra, one would see things in terms of their energy; you couldeasily pick out the great artists and the not-so-great convenience store clerksfrom their high school photos, but more importantly you could simply shine onthe clerk and make him the artist. Horus is the god who is born among humans to lead them. One doesn’t start out asHorus, but one achieves Horus-hood by being chosen as the pharaoh. On themagickal side Horus is the focus of many different subjective universes. All theuniverses-inside-heads believe him to be king, so his Words have power. He hasthe pharaonic abilities: imkaw, “the ability to create confidence,” and s’ ba,“the ability to teach, tax, or punish” (literally, “the power to make a ba”). Onthe religious side he is the high priest of all the gods. On the domestic sidehe is the manager of the supply economy of Egypt, being a practical accountantwho rules by gift and tax. On the military side he is the commander in chief andis expected to lead his troops into battle, not rest at home. Horus is thedouble face of kingship; on the inside he must be trained and alsoself-disciplined to be a wise king, and on the outer side everyone alreadythinks he is king. He is the mystery of incarnation; he must devote himself tolearning the skills to be what he is. Khuit is an interesting word. It is the feminine plural of akh, theimmortalizing force. It comes from a root word meaning “glowing.” One of themany (and certainly one of the oldest) paths of Egyptian immortality was tobecome a star. One did not try to ride around in Ra’s boat or identify withOsiris; instead one identified with energy itself and achieved a place in thebody of Nuit. One did not dissolve into Nuit like salt into water but insteadbeautified her. The Lord of Silence told Crowley that these forces are not oneand that they are feminine. There is no one path to immortality, but the sign ofthe path is that it is receptive and nurturing, and paths as groups may beconsidered to act as part of the Master magickian. Harpocrates was a very popular god for the Greco-Egyptians. The young Horus, notthe brother of Set, but his nephew, he symbolized the forces that protectchildhood. He was adopted into Christianity as the baby Jesus along withblue-clad Isis as Mary. For the Nile dwellers his finger held before his facewas the sign of a nursing babe, the time when according to the Egyptians youreceived your secret soul name from your mother. Crowley, being European, sawthis as the sign for silence, with all the meanings of “shhh!” from tranquilityto not waking a child, from dreamland to conspiracy. It is also the shin (“Sh”),meaning “fire.” Harpocrates is your authentic self. We all interact with this“realer” part of the subjective universe, and it always seems younger than theman in the mirror. This is not because of vanity; it is because it has aged lesssince we keep it from ever seeing the world. One of the manifestations of thispart of human makeup is the current notion of the “inner child.” Because of thispart of ourselves we can always return to a certain innocence and authenticity. If a human is able to see all of these faces as one face and see that face ashis or her own, he or she becomes the Master magickian. Such alignment comeslate in a magickal career, and when it comes all need for Words or otherinternal necessities fall away. Very few will reach this promised land, and morewill be able to describe paths to it, but those who aim for it (or honestly helpothers find it) will have the correct obstacles in their life and the incorrectones lifted away. 5 image [images/00007.jpg] THE WILL Thelema means “Will.” The idea of “true Will” as goal and method illuminates allof the writings of Aleister Crowley. It is the most popularly misunderstood ofhis ideas. This essay will describe the nature of Will and offer some insightson its attainment. Will is not simply doing whatever strikes your fancy at the moment. Throwingaway the presidency because you want to screw an intern would not be Will(unless your greater goal revealed to you by your Holy Guardian Angel was tothrow away the presidency). Giving up on your art show because it offends localdecency, and thus saving yourself trouble, embarrassment, and expense, would notbe Will. Smoking dope while your business goes under is not Will. Will is the service of Nuit. The universe inside your head has one basic desire:expansion. It is expanded by increasing your knowledge of it and of the universeoutside your head. Travel, education, and self-knowledge of allforms—particularly the kind that comes from doing something new orchallenging—are obvious examples of Will acting in the world. With each act ofWill you know more, yet the unknown has been made bigger as well (each answerleads to ten questions). Will is the coming into being of Hadit. The tradition of being yourself is smalland dull, and you will fall into ruts without Will. Will gives you the abilityto fulfill the Laws of your imprinting and overcome them. Every act of Willbrings you greater “power to do,” rather than “power over.” As such it is a keyto free-form immortality, rather than immortality based on haunting certainpeople, places, or things. Each action of Will should give you greater vision;it makes you more of the winged disk of the sun, which sees by its own glow. Will means knowing that you have a destiny. Once you know this, you have thepotential to be the king or queen of your subjective universe. But you don’t getanything by knowing your destiny, other than a target. You can arrive slowly orquickly, in style or as a beggar (and the Law gives you no compassion). Youcan’t make a deal with God or your future self. You merely come to know that acertain path reorders your mind-body-psyche complex into higher energy statesthat release more energy into the cosmos. (That last statement is the equivalentof the beginning sentences of the last two paragraphs.) It cannot be overemphasized that Will has a different meaning in the Right-HandPath and the Left-Hand Path. In the Right-Hand Path, Will means finding the rolethat expresses your essence in the mode most beneficial to the greater Will ofmankind; as such no one can oppose you. In the Left-Hand Path, Will meansfinding the places where you can make actual choices that effect your essence,its manifestation, and the people around you. It is much easier for someone toscrew up on the Left-Hand Path or to make discoveries so far “out of time” thatyou are a freak. The Right-Hand Path brings social evolution to the world; theLeft-Hand Path brings freedom. The two feed off each other. (To complicatematters the Left-Hand-Path follower often has to fulfill Right-Hand-Pathobligations to manifest his or her Will—being a power “that seeks evil but onlyaccomplishes good.”) Will opens the fourfold world to exchange energies. The Egyptians knew therewere four worlds: the human world, the world of the pharaoh, the world of thegods, and the world of the dead. Each action of Will opens doors between theseworlds. Perhaps your seeking after the mysteries has allowed informationbelonging to the dead to circulate in this world. Perhaps you obtained anethical principle from your divine self and have applied it to your own life.Perhaps you simply got a job so your family won’t starve. Will directs the manyenergies of the cosmos to their appropriate spheres. Will reveals itself to those who serve it. The outer world is the trainingground for the Will. One does not gain Will by imagining himself or herself agreat conqueror; one gains by conquering. The outer world always has a thousandsymbolic battles that allow one to fight for the idea of Will (to move the powerof the Divine into the human realm). These may be battles for free speech,battles for human rights, helping someone get an education, or helping someoneobtain an initiation. Each of these are great training grounds or practicerounds for the Will. Not only does their nature serve to teach you things aboutyour True Will, they also offer you a chance to beckon aid to yourself by givingit to others. 6 image [images/00007.jpg] MEMORY Memory has been a mainstay of Western magickal practice since the Renaissance.The prototypes of tarot cards were devices used to enhance memory. There arethree sorts of memory arts needed to use Crowley’s system. These are dailyexamination, universe building and archetype augmentation, and fantastic memory.Let’s look briefly at these types and their place in the system of 666. Daily examination was Philo of Alexandria’s gift to us, as well as the notionthat a Magus has a Word, a book, and a Law—his argument was that Moses wasbetter than Plato, since Moses had these three things. Crowley later took thatlist and made it into his own description of a Magus. The simple practice ofrunning through the day’s events in reverse order has a concentrating effect onthe Self. Once enough practice has set in that the initiate does not simplywince at lapses in consciousness or common sense, he or she will develop moreday-today awareness of how his or her actions are in accordance with the Law ofThelema. The practice has the secondary magickal benefit of allowing one totrack the development of ideas and to learn to spot omens. There are practicalbenefits as well: one’s visualization becomes better, one becomes less lazy, andmatters overlooked tend to be remembered (such as picking up the dry cleaning).The biggest benefit is simply the change in duration that the initiateexperiences; the more she comes to look at her days, the longer the dayssubjectively become. This magick trick allows a person to live twice as long andtherefore achieve in one lifetime what might have taken many. The process of universe building and archetype augmentation is a way of throwingoff social conditioning, gaining prodigious memory, and living in a magickalreality. The process involves learning a symbol system (in Crowley’s system, thetree of life) and then interpreting new things into that schema, including theitems of your life and other symbol systems. On the one hand this breaks downand reconstitutes a world along magickal lines, thus making the elements of yourworld (and to a proportional extent the greater world) more subject to yourWill. Thus it serves Nuit. On the other hand it tends to blur new symbol systemsthat spring from culturally differing ideas, and worse still it can lead toschizophrenia and paranoia, as each event seems “fated” and “ominous.” Nuitdoesn’t care if you are crazy, but Hadit does. The cure to this practice istwofold. One is to respect symbol systems in context, to apply the methods ofanthropology, archeology, and linguistics to systems new to you. The second isto practice the honest diary keeping of the first exercise so that you don’tdrift off into subjective inner realms. The third aspect of Crowley’s memory arts is fantastic memory. This is the artof “remembering” a past life. This guided fantasy is both empowering anddangerous. If a student of art can come to believe that he was Leonardo da Vinciin a past life, it might release enough confidence to do great work in this one.However, if this technique becomes a goal, the initiate ceases to use guidedimagination to discover purpose, but instead becomes lost in nostalgicdaydreaming. Again the cure lies in the first practice and in developing ahealthy sense of humor. Sadly, few manage either of these things; over the yearsI have met no less than ten people who believe themselves to be the incarnationof Crowley. If it were true, in any case, I can only marvel at how much he hasdeteriorated. 7 image [images/00007.jpg] THE PATHS Crowley stated that when one left the adept grades, one could either give upone’s ego and become a babe of the abyss, being at one with Nuit, or one couldshut oneself away from the universe and become a black brother, a follower ofthe Left-Hand Path. These unfortunate SOBs (the black brothers) were eventuallydestroyed by the universal tides acting on them, much as stones being worn downby sea waves. We in the Left-Hand Path see this matter differently. If we didn’t, we wouldscarcely have an interest in the First Beast. Crowley believed that the Master of the temple obtained a true union with theobjective universe and by so doing could interpret any event in that universe asa communication from its meaningful and purposeful side. Ultimately one wouldrealize the unity of spirit and matter and the folly of believing one’s thoughtsto be separate from the cosmos. Crowley saw himself as a teacher of theRight-Hand Path. We believe that spirit and matter are not two phases of the same thing. We wouldsee the relationship of spirit and matter to be like sunlight shining through aglass of water. The light and water interact but do not blend. We believe thatsuch a union is not possible, and if it were, it would not be desirable. We haveaccepted the Law of coming into being and believe that knowing this to be theLaw, our happiness and depth of being comes from heeding it. We believe that as the psyche becomes aware of itself, it begins todifferentiate itself from the universe. The psyche gets more rich as it becomesresponsible for its own contents. One thing the psyche realizes is that to beopen to the universe, you should not “blend” with it. The psyche wishes tobecome more powerful and potent, and therefore it wants to have a better map ofthat universe. The universe inside one’s head can work on the objective universebetter if it has a better correspondence with it. As humans we understand thatthere are many barriers to our understanding: defense mechanisms, faultyunderstandings, cultural blinders, popular misconceptions, faulty sensoryreceptors, and so forth. These blockages to the outside universe must be easedout of the picture. The inner universe must likewise be gently and thoroughlyexamined so that blockages to the flow of energy in the universe within can alsobe removed. There are the sort of people whom Crowley calls “black brothers,”people who vaingloriously refuse to correct their understanding or improve theirperception of the world without. These people rapidly rise up in the world asdictators and tyrants. Depending on their personal power and the correctness oftheir initial understanding, they may come to be dictators of countries or justasshole bosses. In any case they must surround themselves with people who willreflect the Æir incorrect views back to them. At first they will use rhetoricand force of personality, but as their understanding decreases they use fear.Eventually they will die as their psyches cannot receive energies from thecosmos nor send energies to the cosmos in exchange. Those who wish to avoid this fate must establish a group to increase theirfeedback of the human world. Rather than surrounding themselves with people whowill happily parrot back their rhetoric, people of a certain level of beingestablish schools. Here the teacher teaches the methods of her initiation and inexchange learns more about the impersonal aspects of her way of being as othersexperiment with the tools. In short, the teacher must have the beginner’s mindto the student’s discoveries, triumphs, and objections. The school should teachlittle dogma but cause great communication. So like Crowley we do believe that humans have two choices at a certain moment;we think it is between tyrant and teacher. The anger that many people feel toward the so-called Right-Hand Path is not theillusion of union with the cosmos, which it preaches. Humans after all have tomake choices about the unknown, and it is their job to choose in accordance withtheir souls. The Right-Hand Path, however, does not teach people how not tobecome tyrants. It is from their tyranny, which Crowley would call the Æon ofOsiris, that people are feeling their way from and into the Æons of Isis, Horus,Set, and so on. We respect the First Beast, who was revealed of the Prince ofDarkness, because he helped melt the ice. We feel he did not understand his contact with Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu, who clearlyhad not been absorbed into Nuit but had made the pact with the future to teachand learn, which is the key to an active afterlife, just as much as it is a keyto this life. 8 image [images/00007.jpg] BALANCE One of the important ideas in Crowley’s system is balance. Balance is the key tocausing change in accordance with the Will. Balance has a meaning bothmacrocosmically and microcosmically, and understanding both is important for themagickian. Crowley, independently of Freud, understood the dangers of repression. Thingswithin the microcosmos may be well lit by the light of reason or may be beingwarmed to manifestation by the source. Desire ceases upon the repressed notion,and our lives are filled with the “Freudian slip,” Poe’s “imp of the perverse,”or the Christian explanation that the “devil made me do it.” If you deny yourhatred of your coworker, it will manifest itself in stupid, wicked things yousay. If you ignore your lusts under the mantle of chastity, you will become asex-obsessed fiend. Although these ideas are intellectually familiar to us, weseldom act on them. We assume that our repressions are probably sexual in natureand that our enlightened attitudes have saved us from such quaint problems. Thisattitude does not reflect a holistic approach to the Self or the world. Here are a few types of imbalance that we don’t recognize. For example, we don’tconsider that if we repress the body by not allowing it exercise, it willmanifest its will to action in another form, like a heart attack or diabetes. Wemistakenly assume that the body is not part of the subconscious. We don’tconsider that if we repress the mind by not giving it challenging enoughmaterial, it will spin off into strange, subjective webs; this is because wedon’t think about the mechanism of the mind as being part of the subconscious. We understand the subconscious is part of the darkness of Nuit, although she ismuch more than this. We know the magick we thrust into her and forget workswell, but we fail to see that any “forbidden” desire will work just as well. Itwill develop along with the rest of us, which is why when men and women ofspiritual paths finally manifest their dark side, they are so rank and evil. Theinitiate must always be wary of total faith or belief in an idea, lest hissubconscious betray him at a crucial moment. Herein is the secret ofself-sabotage, which is the destroyer of initiates. On a slightly larger scale this is the root of bad behavior by large groups ofhumans. If a group wishes to ban certain ideas, feelings, or needs, thecollective effect of their subjective universes will be to manifest thesethings. Thus the political party most interested in less government makes moregovernment, the free speech group produces laws for expression, and so forth.The magickian knows this. If he wishes to empower the group, he will seek tomake members confront their opposite idea and deal with the reality of theiractions. If he merely wishes to use their force, he understands that themagickal power of the group is 180 degrees opposite from its stated goal. On the scale of humanity, ages and æons are the expression of repression. It iseasy to see people in history who belonged to the Æon of Horus or that of Set,yet the times did not support their Work, and they had to do great Workings insecrecy to obtain their results. Now the collective might of mankind is readyfor freedom, cooperation, and individuality. This too will last for a season.The vision of a Magus and the power of his Word may be for only a few or formany as the consequences of imbalance are worked out. Since the nature ofmankind reflects the nature of man, one may study history by studying oneselfand vice versa. It is notable that the magickal keys of the Æon of Horus, suchas the Enochian system, the Abramelin, the invocation of the Headless One, andothers had been lost and found before being activated. Likewise, in your ownlife you will discover that the roots of your magickal self will have appearedin early actions and experiences that you discounted as being of trifling worth. 9 image [images/00007.jpg] SEX MAGICK The Buddha taught us that there are three things we cling to: being, nonbeing,and pleasurable sensations. The initiate of Thelema must learn to break his orher clinging to these things and make them the tools of his or her Will. Theyform the three sides of the triangle in which the eye resides. The greatest pleasure is orgasm. In this moment we have a direct gateway betweenthe cosmos and the deepest part of the psyche. It is the best moment ofcommunication, and it is the worst if you are wishing to communicate anythingother than the sure joy of your existence. However, that communication is themost powerful one in the magickian’s repertoire. Any wish that may be trulyjoined with that feeling may be sent. Sex magick at the moment of orgasm has twogreat powers. First, it can affect the destiny of any being who is generated byit. (One can have conception without orgasm, but with it the parents can givecertain information to the offspring.) Second, it puts you in the same state asevery other human having an orgasm, so that your Will touches and communicateswith theirs. For the second reason, sex magick is great for practical effects in which onewishes for something that other people can give, like wealth. It is also goodfor exploring the nature of the human cosmos for the same reason. The great 69rite, the rite of the holy hexagram, can teach more secrets about human nature(beginning with your own) than a hundred self-help books. For the first reason, solitary sex magick is great for sending entities into theastral plane. One “fathers” or “mothers” an entity with another Hidden side ofthe universe. You can create servants and allies who do not have your Haditinstructions in the form of sigils, runes, and so forth, but do have your Nuitinstructions; in other words, they are related to all of you. Free Will andadaptation are the powers that Nuit confers on you and will confer to thosebeings born of you. Herein is the secret of genii. Sex magick is attractive because it is easy to do. Some teenage boys literallyspend hours practicing certain aspects of it. Its power, however, lies in thatit changes you from someone who clings to pleasure—who says, “I just need thisfor comfort and then I am out in the dreary world again”—to someone who uses anaspect of existence to further that aspect and explore things beyond the flesh.Do not look down on the furthering; be very wary of anyone who suggests sex forsex’s sake is bad. But do not fear the cosmic aspect. You can face aspects ofthe cosmos that are truly alien without fear if you have pleasure as yourshield. Therein is the secret of incubi, succubi, and alien abductions. 10 image [images/00007.jpg] YOGA Yoga (from the Sanskrit word yuga, meaning “yoke”) is a method of obtainingliberation from the limitations of the flesh, the distractions of the senses,and the inadequacies of thought. It produces this liberation by yoking thebehavior of the yogin (the yoga practitioner) to practices of truthfulness,restraint, focus, and meditation. Pure and deep contact with the inner world canproduce a freedom from some of the frictions of the outer world as one iscausally linked with the true source of transformation and freed from the simpleforce of change. British guilt about the colonization of India had exalted that country’sspiritual practices in nineteenth-century popular fiction, and as is often thecase in the magickal world, destiny sends the make-believe out first, and so weare confused by the real. The make-believe has to show up first (change in thesubjective universe produces a change in the objective universe). Yoga was apre-Indo-European method of personal change and represents (along with tantra)the Dravidian contribution to world civilization. It has four great advantagesas a practice: (1) it’s cheap and portable, so all you need are body and brain;(2) it can practiced all of the time; (3) it produces practical results such asrelaxation, concentration, and even magickal powers; and (4) it can give thebeginner early experiences of alternate states of consciousness in a controlledenvironment. Any practice that restrains behavior is a yoga, and any form of devotion is ayoga. Restraint of speech, control of breath, sitting or standing in certainpostures, chanting the name of a god or any other magickal formula, and gazingat an object all qualify as part of the practice. Crowley changed previousWestern magickal thought deeply with his understanding of yoga. Before him itwas considered important for a magickian to be virtuous or “pure,” with theunderstanding that the supreme power of the universe was squeamish. Crowleydiscovered that purity means strength of essence. One can become one with thesource of transformation. One need not invoke this force to do this and that asthe ceremonialist does; one can reach within and grasp the force that is alwaysworking on us. The revealing, transforming, and shaping force can flow if youallow your own thoughts to be absorbed in it. This state can bring aboutmagickal powers (siddhis) in which miracles of the inner world can becomemiracles in the outer world, but more importantly the inner world no longer hasto arrange hardships and ordeals for you to “teach you a lesson.” You can, viayoga, pass beyond the “life is a school” mode of being into being your very ownSelf. It is difficult for the beginner to realize that such things may be achievedwith years of practice. The early rush that is often mistaken for the finalstates can become dull, so Crowley balanced his system with magick. The resultsof magick become much stronger for the focused mind, so the beginner sees thevalue of yoga and will continue his or her practice until the deeper rewardscome. This piece of brilliance makes sure that students will follow the pathwithout the presence of the guru. Thus we don’t make our pilgrimages to meet theholy men until we are half-cooked and rationally sure that we want to stay inthe oven. 11 image [images/00007.jpg] ABRAMELIN The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage tells the story of anEgyptian magickian named Abramelin, or Abra-Melin, who taught a system ofinitiation to Abraham of Würzberg, a German Kabbalist and alchemist presumed tohave lived from about 1362 to about 1458. MacGregor Mathers translated a ratherunreliable version of this text and changed the shape of Western magick forever.Despite its metanarrative of being the property of a Jew, the book lacks Jewishterminology and says that initiation can be pursued by Jews, Christians, andpagans (even, remarkably, women). Abraham the Jew presents his book as being agift to his younger son, Lamech, as he had given the gift of the Kabbalah to hiselder son. Although there was an alchemist known as Abraham the Jew operatingabout the time of Columbus (and playing some shadowy role in central Europeanpolitics), the book itself is a fraud. There is no Hebraic lore, Christianoperators are cautioned against converting to Judaism, positive references aremade to the apostles and especially St. John, and so forth. It appears that thework was written in the early eighteenth century, but was backdated to the endof the fifteenth. It seems to be a fusion of the Germanic idea of the fylg jaand Rabbi Shlomo Molcho’s idea of an internal maggid, or teacher. It set up theview that we have an archetype within that will guide our initiation and providepractical psychic powers. The book and its theories have a great deal to say about Crowley’s system andthe nature and use of Will. In Crowley’s system one can only know one’s TrueWill if you have obtained the “knowledge and conversation” with one’s HolyGuardian Angel. People who have not obtained this experience cannot fulfill theLaw of “Do what thou wilt”—a distinction lost on many so-called Thelemites. The book aims to give the operator the knowledge and conversation of one’s HolyGuardian Angel. After this noble Work is achieved the magickian can force thehoards of hell to swear obedience to him. The book is in three parts: the firsttells of the wonderful journeys the author has undertaken that led to himmeeting Abramelin in Egypt and the uses he put his magickal powers to, thesecond is advice about the appropriate mindset of the magickian, and the thirdexplains the operation as well as gives the magickians a series of talismansthat the demons may operate. Note that the book’s central myth—the journey fromEurope into Egypt to obtain knowledge—is Crowley’s life story; as such this isanother example of finding the pattern you need as you find your True Will. Thisis another example of 93, or reyn til runa! MacGregor Mathers found the handwritten manual in the Paris Arsenal. He did notperform the operation and certainly was not able to make its wealth talismansoperate. He wound up being paid the lessthan-princely sum of thirty-five poundsfor the translation. He had a passion for finding obscure lore and incorporatingit wholesale into his magickal system (one of many traits that he shared withAnton LaVey). The operation of the sacred magick is different than the average goetia orsorcery. It has the formulas of Medial Black Magick, but these formulas areempowered by a deep transformation of the magickian—that is to say their baselies in an initiatory operation or Greater Black Magick. In the run-of-the-millgrimoire the sorcerer is given the talisman of a demon that he can then conjureup and force to do the Work by threats and name dropping (“I am on good termswith IHVH, buddy!”). In the sacred magick the operator is told to prepare forthe operation for six months and then retreat from the world for six months. Thepreparation requires that he set up a property to do the Work, order his life tohave few distractions, study the Work beforehand, and prepare the perfumes andtools needed. He must create a chamber that has an eastern section for invokingand becoming IHVH and a western one for invoking the demonic forces. Then he canbegin the Work. For the first two months he prays hard, eats and sleepssparingly, and focuses on his goal of obtaining the knowledge of the HolyGuardian Angel; for the second two months he prays harder and focuses more; forthe last two months he prays harder still, and sleeps and eats even less than inthe four months previous, and then the Holy Guardian Angel shows up and revealscosmic knowledge and instructions on how to make the demons swear allegiance tohim. Then, over three days, he turns to the west and invokes the four princes ofhell—Leviathan, Satan, Lucifer, and Belial—and their minions to serve him. Lets look at Crowley’s performance of the Work and then at the teachings of theWorking. In 1899 he purchased his land at Boleskine to perform the rite. Hismagickal father had translated it, and at that time Crowley was even signingsome documents Aleister MacGregor. Mathers needed him as an enforcer, and he hadto put the rite aside to do some police work in the Golden Dawn. The secondattempt was in 1903, but his marriage to Rose Edith Kelly interrupted theperformance. The third and successful attempt was made during a walking tour ofChina in 1906. Crowley visualized the chamber and tools, and he performed theWork by Will alone. Here are some of the lessons of the Working. * Magick is deeply integrated into one’s life. This Working takes a year to do. * The formula of the father (Abrahadabra) begins with finding an initiator (Abramelin, MacGregor Mathers, etc.), surpassing him, and then manifesting his material. * The estate is an important step in the male initiation; owning property is part of one’s development. * Workings begin with polarizing and separating parts of the self (the eastern and western orientation), making them strong, and recombining them. * Samadhi, the ultimate absorption of the thoughts in the object of thought, will transform the thinker. In this case, the object is the Holy Guardian Angel. * The formula of seeking, withdrawing, and then acting in the world is transforming, whether it is performed by Abraham the Jew, Crowley, or someone else. Abraham says that after the operation he Worked, his Will in the world—givingservice to princes and correcting the moral flaws of bishops—which indicates howmagickal power is to be used to change the world. Abraham says that it is unwisefor a pagan to convert to Christianity, or a Christian to Judaism, to performthe sacred magick. He gives the reason that this would be a revolt against theperson’s essential nature. This may be the earliest that the First Beast read ofthe idea of magick being connected to one’s essence or, as he would have said,“True Will.” Imbalance is useful. By repressing one’s demonic side for sixmonths, the demons are ready to appear and work. The magickian can use the sameforces that make the æons flow. Abraham says that there is a huge treasurehidden for the use of the Antichrist. This may have been a useful seed to plantin 666’s mind, after the name his mother had given him. The sacred magick showedthat letter magick worked well for the energized subconscious; this may havebeen an early encounter with the archetype of the subjective universe, thegoddess Nuit. 12 image [images/00007.jpg] TAROT The best-known divinatory system in the Western world is the tarot, and Crowleymade use of its formulas to release forces in the occult world to bring abouthis Will. This essay examines the formula of the tarot and the nature ofCrowley’s reworking of that formula. It is unclear when the tarot took its present form. It seems to be of two roots.The trumps seem likely to have come from late antiquity, as suggested byscholars like Sigurd Agrell. Agrell suggested that the trumps tell the story ofa Mithraic initiation. This Persian tradition may have arrived in Europe withthe original Mithras cult or been returned by the Roma (Gypsies), who arrived inEurope (via Persia) around AD 900. Interestingly, when the Roma came to Europethey brought their goddess Sara-la-Kali, who became St. Sara, and built hermajor shrine on the site of an old Mithras temple. The trumps were added to theplaying cards of India, with their four suites (and perhaps gaining a namederived from taru, which in Sanskrit means “a deck of cards”). In any event thecombined deck formed a popular fortune-telling game until Antoine Court deGébelin published his book The Primitive World Analyzed and Compared to theModern World. In the eighth volume of this huge work, Gébelin and his friend theCompte de Mellet each wrote an essay on the tarot. Gébelin was a famousFreemason. He and his pal Benjamin Franklin initiated Voltaire into the MasonicLes Neuf Soeurs Lodge (Nine Sisters Lodge) on April 4, 1778. Anyway, Gébelingave the argument that the tarot was of Egyptian origin and introduced aten-card spread that is the ancestor of most modern spreads. Mellet took theidea further and called the tarot “the Book of Thoth” and established a hithertounknown connection between the Hebrew alphabet and the trumps. Volume eight soldwell and remained in print, despite such disturbances as the French Revolution. The formula of the tarot is simple but very adaptable. It has three parts: thecommonality of mankind, the power of chance in the world, and the force ofpremeditation (along with the nature of human reception of information). Let’slook at these. The Commonality of Mankind Humans are unique in their responses to the problems and rites of passage thatdefine their evolving state, but the problems and the rites of passage are heldin common. We all work on issues with our parents, we all need love andacceptance, we all need money and want a great deal more, and so forth. Themeaning of phrases like “high school graduation” will be very different for eachperson, but the commonalities of the events allow us to talk about them. This isjust as true for concepts such as “father” (the emperor), “nurturing an idea”(the hermit), and so forth. Crowley’s system begins with the notion that allhumans are pretty much alike, which he learned from the tarot. He connected thetarot in this instance to the magickal device of the Rosicrucians. The book TheFame and Confession of the Fraternity of the Rosy Cross, published in 1612, saysthe brotherhood has a magickal device called Rota, or wheel that reveals fate.All humans have a certain number of experiences that shape them because they aremanifest in the objective (and hence mechanical) universe. (If you wish tounderstand the commonality of humanity as revealed through the tarot, setyourself up as a public reader for a while; you will see the common threads.)The trumps, with their story of an initiation, set up the “common event” part ofthe deck. The Power of Chance in the World In all of our endeavors chance plays a huge role. Think of an event—a wedding, afuneral, a grand opening—and then see how different it is if certain chancephenomena occur. What happens if it rains? What happens if you are feelinginsecure that day? What if you are ill? What if you just received an unexpectedinheritance? What if the minister at the wedding looks like an ex-lover or yourfirst customer happens to sound like your father? The minor cards representthese forces. The magickian adapts to, opens up to, or deflects these forces.The cards show the many forces of life, the phenomological randomness that makesfreedom possible, choice desirable, and certainty unknowable. The Force of Premeditation Humans get what they think they’re going to get. This formula of self-fulfillingprophecy is discovered by every intelligent human. This means any divinatorytool has a great chance of being accurate no matter how it is designed. Humansare also changed by what they do get, because the emotional and mental statesthey carry into an experience are changed by that experience, just as theexperience is filtered by those states. This is the formula of initiation. Nowif the magickian knew what he should be feeling or thinking before a givenevent, he would have the chance to give himself the right feelings or thoughts.This is the formula of divination. Now if you wanted to arrange the destinies ofseveral humans so that they fit together, it would be easier if they were usingthe same tool, so that their premeditations would be linked. This is the formulaof the æon. Crowley rightly points out that the Golden Dawn’s angel of the tarotis HRU, whose name is a name of Horus. Last, humans under stress take ininformation that is digested later, so filling their minds with your own map ofthe universe when they divine is a formula of teaching. Crowley and painter Lady Frieda Harris designed the Thoth Tarot with theseformulas. His working of the tarot began when he was sixty-three years old andtook five years (1938–1943 CE, or 34–39 AH). When the American OTO wished togenerate interest in themselves and the Word of Thelema, they released the deckinto the world, in 1969 CE (65 = LXV AH, or III AS) (1904 is 65 years before1969). In Crowley’s system 65 stands both for God and the formula of the GreatWork. Remember that the Æon of Horus dates from 1904, so 1969 is its 65th year.The American OTO turned the world on with this deed at a very deep level. The Thoth Tarot deck is one of the most powerful Workings of the First Beast. Itis one of the best ways to be touched by his Word. 13 image [images/00007.jpg] KABBALAH In 1652 Athanasius Kircher popularized a diagram called the Tree of Life, whichorganized the Jewish mystical system of late antiquity into a pathworking systemwherein the ten emanations of God into the universe were connected by twenty-twopaths connected with the letters of the Hebrew alphabet. This Jesuit inventiontook Judaic mysticism and gave it to esoteric Freemasonry. By the time Crowleywas on the scene, Kircher’s system was the backbone of Western esotericism, andit (coupled with the traditional lore of the Kabbalah) became the background ofUncle Al’s system. This essay cannot even hope to scratch the surface of one ofthe richest traditions on the planet and merely hopes to point out some of thearchitecture of the Kabbalah in the system of Crowley’s magick. Crowley hadreceived the Kabbalah from his magickal father, MacGregor Mathers, who hadtranslated Knorr Von Rosenroth’s book Kabbalah Denudata as The KabbalahUnveiled. Here are the principles of the Kabbalah that Crowley used in Thelema: * Although Jewish mystics believe that one does not achieve union with God, but rather togetherness with God, the texts that Crowley had to work with suggested union: all souls are part of Adam Kadmon, and each has its task. All people have their True Will and will eventually be reabsorbed into Nuit. * The three pillars of the tree are important: a central pillar that represents grace, the gift from above, and the other two representing contemplation and action. Success in Thelema depends on the Work from the Divine joined by magick/action and mysticism/ receptivity. * The basic layer of God is ayin, which means “nothingness.” The basic layer in Thelema is nothingness, the inner space that is the subjective universe, or Nuit. * Souls transmigrate until people fulfill their task. In Crowley’s system people transmigrate until they fulfill their task. * Spirits have descended through all the levels of manifestation, so that they can regain their link to the Divine. In Crowley’s system this is likewise true; in both cases that link occurs in the sephiroth of beauty. * The world is ruled by a select group of hidden chiefs. Crowley also thought this was true. * If one is insufficiently prepared, one will be led into madness (for example, seeing duality instead of unity). Crowley likewise stressed this point. * Holy texts must be interpreted on three levels: literal, metaphoric, and via ciphers. Crowley recommends these methods for studying his texts. 14 image [images/00007.jpg] THE ENOCHIAN SYSTEM Ever wonder why the watch on your wrist has its orientation to the RoyalObservatory in Greenwich, England? Or why the zero degree of longitude passesthrough that observatory? Perhaps you’ve even journeyed there and stood on the“center of time and space.” Maybe you did so on a tour that took you toStonehenge on the same day, and you wondered about the remanifestation of theBritish need to orient the world? If you have stood at the spike that marks thecenter of time and space, you probably noticed that John Dee drove it into theworld. You may have even got off on the fact the Dee was an occultist or that hesigned his spy reports to Queen Elizabeth I “007,” the same number AleisterCrowley’s good friend Ian Fleming used for his character James Bond. What youmay not have considered is what Dee did with his famous Enochian system, andwhat Crowley did with it later. This essay will deal with four questions: Where did Dee get his system? How didit fit into his world? Where did Crowley get the system? How does it fit intothe magick of Thelema? Dee’s famous Enochian system has four roots: the idea of Enoch, the cipher of J.A. Pantheus, his scrying mirror of Aztec origin, and last, the scrying abilityof Edward Kelly. Dee’s “seer” Edward Kelly was an alchemist (and perhaps a conman). Crowley, by the way, counted Kelly as a former incarnation. According tothe book of Hebrews in the Christian Bible, the Lord carried Enoch off to heavenso that he did not die. There was a great deal of speculation about Enoch duringthe Renaissance (see, for example, the discussion of Pantheus below), but theapocryphal Book of Enoch had yet to resurface. So when Dee titled one of hismagickal books The Book of Enoch and filled it with phrases that echoed the bookof Revelation, he was consciously replacing an existing teleology with one ofhis own. This is a great example of a mystic using an existing language andsystem to destroy it by replacing it. Twenty years before the creation of theEnochian system, Dee had acquired a copy of Voarchadumia, the alchemical text ofJ. A. Pantheus, which possessed an angelic alphabet. The work had introduced himto certain ideas of alchemy, and after the crucial time of forgetting, thecharacters had resurfaced in his mind as ways of further concealing theenciphered English that the keys were received in. Pantheus described his art of“voarchadumia” as being distinct from “vulgar alchemy” and related to a trueKabbalah of metals. (It was also the name of a Venetian known to have ties toPoland, which may be the reason, beyond simple patronage, that Dee choose Krakówas the site of his experiments.) Voarchadumia purified the gold within metalsthrough operations involving letters, and the art is variously assigned to Enochor to Tubal Cain. Pantheus said that it was the precursor to an operation thatmultiplied gold called “sophia.” Dee had employed seers before meeting Kelly,but he had a rather special mirror for the seer that brought him the Enochiankeys. He had obtained a piece of Spanish colonial treasure, an obsidian mirrorfrom Mexico. Dee may have been unaware that the priests of Tezcatlipoca had usedthis same hunk of silicon dioxide to see the future, aided by the SmokingMirror, the Aztec Prince of Darkness that they had received from oldercivilizations. Kelly was the last part of the equation. He had the specialchemistry to be John Dee’s scarlet woman. I am not implying a sexualrelationship, but his unsavory past plus his abilities at necromancy made himthe personification of Nuit that Dee needed. With this mix, Dee was able to receive the operative keys of his understandingof the universe. Dee explained his views in his preface to Euclid, the founderof geometery. The universe is of three parts: a changing corruptible zone (theEarth), the unchanging and perfect heavens, and an invisible zone that linksthese parts, consisting of metaphysics (including mathematics). The Enochiankeys are accesses to the forces that fill this subjective zone. Dee maintainedthat they could be used to bring the heavenly perfection down to Earth. He tookthe art of refining gold to mean changing the percipient of magick ritual, sothat his actions (based on higher knowledge) would bring happiness and knowledgeto those around him. Dee spent little time spreading the Enochian gospel. He didpass on some instruction to Captain Thomas Rudd, the chief engineer of QueenElizabeth, who wrote a book on angel magick that added geomancy and other artsto the system. Just as the mystic destroys a language and system by speaking anew vision into it, the magickian does so by integrating and synthesizing withina larger whole to affect more of the universe. The magickian in this activity ismore like Nuit, the mystic like Hadit. The mystic achieves his goal by givingthe magickian the new material to integrate. MacGregor Mathers was born Samuel Liddel Mathers and added the “MacGregor”surname in later life. He had the good luck of encountering Rudd’s book, whichhad already begun the work of integrating Dee’s system into Western occultism.He saw the material as perfect for the members of the second order of the GoldenDawn, those people who had already made connections with the Holy GuardianAngel. Members of the second order would have proven their mystical ability byconversation with the Holy Guardian Angel, and their magickal ability as well,so they could be given the keys to better mystical revelations keyed to making abetter world. Since it was to be a guarded secret, it would have had a deepimpact on the psyches of the people receiving it. Those of us in this age whenthere are no written secrets cannot understand the power of this. In our worldthe most hidden of magick books is a few clicks away, the secrets of magickalsocieties for sale, and conversations are tracked by the NSA. Crowley receivedhis admission to the second order shortly before he parted ways with MacGregorMathers. The keys have the same use in the magick of Thelema as they did for Crowley.They provide a viewpoint of an unchangeable part of the self (every man andevery woman is a star); a changeable part made of the elements of earth, air,fire, and water; and a metaphysical ladder between the two that allows you tobring the perfection of one into the becoming of another. These keys providedCrowley with the instruction he needed since he had no human link toward theunknown anymore without MacGregor Mathers. In Dee’s model the Earth is coveredby thirty ethereal realms or “aires”; each imposes a law upon the world. Whenyou are underneath all thirty of them, you are very constrained; if you ascendthrough aires, level by level, a great freedom comes to your soul, mind, andheart. Principally, in Egypt, Crowley transversed the aires by the thirty keysand thereby got a map of future development. The images, relating to the degreesand the consciousnesses thereof, appeared in the language he had already gained(mainly from his Protestant upbringing, aided by Dee’s own Revelation-basedlanguage) but encoded so that he could only recognize them when his ownexperiences allowed him access to their hints. When this occurred he was thenable to integrate each vision into his magickal practice of the time, thusexporting into the world the material created by the deepest level of hispsyche. Thus he was able to effect Dee’s aims of improving the person and thengiving them power. He published his own visions so that his structures and mapsmight be of use to others seeking their own states of being. However, it isimportant to know that his visions are not as useful to people who obtain theirown visions. 15 image [images/00007.jpg] ILLUMINISM Few words can drive fear into the heart of a conspiracy theorist like the wordIlluminati. Crowley didn’t choose the words scientific Illuminism for his systemto shock the foolish (even though he was fond of that pastime). He identifiedwith the progressive and rationalistic movement of the eighteenth century for atleast three reasons. For magickal reasons he identified his movement with theforces that made it possible for the Æon of Horus to come into being. He alsochose a methodology that seemed least likely to let students beyond his ken gooff the deep end. Last, he wished to prepare against the coming dark age hefeared his Word would bring. Let’s look at the idea of Illuminism and then atCrowley’s reasons. In the eighteenth century a new notion came into being: that people could bemade happy by being good and could be made good by education; an assumption ofequality beginning with the process of education was the basis for this idea.This notion had its roots in 1492 with the publication of the Corpus Hermeticumby the Academy of the Medicis. The idea was that people could be madebetter—substances below could be made like substances above—by bringing thatwhich is above and mixing it with what is below. This idea manifested in the American Revolution and to a lesser extent in theideas of the Nine Sisters Lodge in Paris and the Bavarian Illuminati. TheAmerican Revolution was the prototype for dozens of others. It is a root of manystars. On May 1, 1776, Adam Weishaupt founded the short-lived group of theIlluminati. He had three goals: that the power of governments should be limited(allowing nut cases to claim that he wanted anarchy), that science replacereligion as the mode of dealing with the problems of day-to-day life (allowinghis critics to claim him as an atheist), and that women should be educated andtreated as equals to men (allowing his critics to proclaim him insane or a toolof the devil). He wished to use the mechanism of Masonry, which had the virtuesof equality, fraternity, and belief in moral teaching, as the means to spreadhis ideas. This is the final proof for fools looking for a conspiracy. Living ina world remade in the life-affirming light of these ideals, they cannot imaginea world where such things needed to be hidden. Of course I am speaking of theworld that exists in Jefferson’s Word. We have been inspired to move toward thisworld, but we often fall short. Crowley understood that most of the ideals were becoming manifest in his day. Atthe time of the Cairo Working women didn’t have the vote in the United States orthe United Kingdom, but the movement was afoot. The Scopes Monkey Trial wasstill twenty-one years in the future, but scientific thinking was becoming moreof a force than religion. Men had flown in a heaver-than-air craft. Most of theworld was under colonial domination, but social consciousness was spreading, andgovernments were waning. Smart people could see the tides favored Illuminism,and Crowley could see that not only was Illuminism producing the new world, italso made possible the gospel of Thelema. Crowley identified his magickalmovement with a movement that was becoming the ruling force and was resonantwith his goals. Ideologically that made the idea easier to sell to smart people,who were experiencing upward mobility, and magickally it allowed the peopletransformed by his system to have a social matrix in which to express thattransformation. That took care of the third part of the Van Gennep rite ofpassage: isolation, liminality, and reintegration. It can work in a societyundergoing a predictable social change as well as in a traditional one. The use of science, the method of hypothesis and experiment, is a good way tokeep magickians from wigging out. The magickian learns how to alter hissubjective universe, but unless he has both training in logic to test hisconclusions within and a skeptical attitude to test his results without, he caneasily spiral into a morass of subjectivity. “Mailorder” initiation isespecially prone to such problems, and Crowley was not setting out to create asmall cult in his various hometowns. Crowley was not the first to set up aninitiation-at-a-distance school (that would be Paschal Beverly Randolph), but hewas one of the first to do so as an international society. Crowley also assumed that his new æon would not creep in on little cat feet. Newideas are often born in violence, and he assumed that a new dark age would come.So one would need a few societies to carry the ideas forward, which is why heplanted more than one seed. One of the truths that magickians should learn isthat systems do not change peacefully and progressively. The old system doesfight back in its death spasms. (One may notice that the forties and eightieswarned of in The Book of the Law weren’t exactly great times for occultists.) Wemay view his ideas as quaint, but the workings of secrecy are a way to keeptraditions alive; the forces that threaten them may simply be the forces ofdumbing down. 16 image [images/00007.jpg] THE SCARLET WOMAN The mystery of the scarlet woman is not about hot sex, Crowley’s bed-mates, oreven the Amanita muscaria–induced visions of St. John of Patmos. It is aboutancient Sumerian religion and its remanifestation in the nineteenth century,what Rose Kelly did for Uncle Al, what Moina Mathers did for MacGregor Mathers,and the nature of magickal manifestation. This essay looks at these things andmay help you find your scarlet woman (even if you’re not looking for a woman). In the nineteenth century a “new” sort of woman showed up. They were ofchildbearing age, given to sexual excesses, very interested in women’s andchildren’s rights, clairvoyant, and talked with dead people. They ran forpresident (Victoria Woodhull), founded religions (H. P. Blavatsky), fought forwomen’s suffrage (Isabella Beecher Hooker), made sure that kids got lunches atschool (Annie Besant), published important magazines about women’s rights(Paulina Wright Davis), and persuaded MacGregor Mathers to let women join theGolden Dawn (Anna Kingsford). I could make a much longer list, but if you areunaware of these women you are missing a rather large piece of history. Thesewomen all had three defining characteristics. They believed in local activityconnected by a sense of sisterhood that broke socioeconomic barriers. In theirearly years they could commune with the spirits, generally producingmanifestations of light and sometimes materializations. They taught that occultgroups should work for the social betterment of mankind through empowerment andeducation (and not through existing political structures, but in what we callgrassroots politics today). History has sanitized these noble women of their occult and magickal ideas, andignored the fact that the spiritualists of the nineteenth century are asresponsible for women’s rights now as Freemasons were for democracy a centuryearlier. Moina Mathers was a great example. Her clairvoyant ability not onlyintroduced the idea of the feminine into Western magick, but she also influencedher brother, Henri Bergson, to develop the idea of the élan vital, the feminineforce that strives to a greater sense of being alive and being more conscious,the sensuous power of evolution working through us. When she hooked up withMacGregor Mathers, his star began to rise because she could provide him with thehints of what he should do. For Uncle Al, it was Rose Kelly. Her prompting of “they are waiting for you” ledCrowley to invoke Horus on March 20, 1904. She galvanized his life. Had theyremained a couple there is no telling what the First Beast might have achieved.Crowley was fortunate to be born when the political woman seer was making herbiggest stance since Babylonian times. However, he failed. He never remadehimself for the scarlet woman that her universe might be energized by thefuture; he merely thought of her as a means to an end (and therefore lived withdisposable women). This is Crowley’s greatest failing, in that it has made womenin the occult world into whores, media-designed vampires, or made them avoid“darker” magicks since it seems their only value is as a sex aide. If thearchetype of the powerful seer and the political changer returns (and men decideto remake themselves and share their vision with women) the golden age willactually begin. The scarlet woman is not merely a sex aid made flesh. She or he is the being whoexcites the sensuous and erotic force of evolution in you. Many magickians (andalmost all male magickians) desire a companion who will listen to them blatheron about their theories of the universe. Their ego is so weak that it needs tobe propped up 24/7. But a few will seek that person who in some sense alreadylives in the future. Deep sexual and love attraction to these people is whatpulls the magickian out of the current time stream and puts him or her just alittle bit into the future. This means the scarlet woman represents in touchable form what you arestruggling for and the joys your struggle will bring to you and others. She orhe can give you information from the realm of your own possible futures and canpull you toward that realm not by reason alone but also by lust. When suchexcitation can take place, worlds will be created. The priesthood of Inanna knewthis art and used it to make kings in Babylon. Obtaining such a mate is thesupreme act of magick. It will transform every part of you; it will painfullyput you through a purification of your past, and it will make you seem slightlystupid or mad to the world, since you are often reacting to something that hasnot happened yet. Few people can put aside their ego needs to pursue such love. It is a truism that men love people for who they are and women love them for whothey can be made to be. The scarlet woman (or the demon lover) is different. Sheliterally sees you as the Self you are trying to be and is totally loyal to thatSelf. The scarlet woman is the only safe external road to reducing the false egoand useless vanity of the magickian; she does not want to kill your vanity outof society’s desire to hold people in line, out of human pettiness, or out ofher “baggage.” The scarlet woman is the only safe external way for the magickianto build up his permanent ego. She can provide as much energy for youractivities in the objective universe as Nuit does in your subjective universe,based on her true love for the Self your Self wants to be. Much of the same could be said of the demon lover, who provides purpose to thefemale magickian, being an external Hadit. The other variations (Nuit and Nuitor Had and Had) have powers that are specific but are beyond this discourse. Itis merely enough to note that mutual exchange and love are the keys. Crowley did not allow his women to reduce his ego. The result is that they hadto flee reality. Most of the endless parade of scarlet women took to drink, histwo legal wives had to go to mental asylums, and his daughters died—all as waspredicted in The Book of the Law. He committed the sin of restriction; he didnot change himself because of love, and such vampirism not only kills thescarlet woman, it also taints the Work produced by the divine dyad. Crowley’sgood fortune was being born as the age of the woman was beginning, as MagusBlavatsky uttered her Word in 1875. However, he had the misfortune of being tooVictorian in his fascination with sex; ‘tis not fucking that sets us free, it isthe state we experience during fucking that is the guide to freedom. However, such imbalances will rectify themselves. The seeds planted in thenineteenth century that informed his Work are sprouting and will lead us intothe Age of Aquarius. I have seen and Worked with the Magi who will do so. 17 image [images/00007.jpg] LOCH NESS When I began this book I was saddened that some bright soul at the BBC hadalready thought up the perfect title The Other Loch Ness Monster. I want to lookat four aspects of Boleskine House and its place in Aleister Crowley’s system ofmagick and mysticism: Boleskine and the paranormal, Crowley’s interest in theCeltic twilight, the importance of the estate for the magickian, and last, theidea of centers. Boleskine House overlooks Loch Ness on the Caledonian Waterway and offersexcellent salmon fishing. It is a slightly spooky structure, with its stone dogsand stone eagles guarding the back entrance to the house, and the view of theloch toward the north and west would have given Uncle Al an interesting viewduring his performance of the Abramelin operation. But there is more afoot tothe area than the breeding grounds of the rare great crested newt. Deeper thanthe North Sea, Loch Ness is said to be the home of a great serpent. In 564 St.Columba killed a few hundred men in Ireland (over a copyright dispute); hispenance was to convert enough Picts to replace the fallen Irishmen. In 565 heencountered Picts burying a man slain by the great worm of the loch and broughtthe dead man back to life. St. Columba went after the “water-horse” that livedin the lake and banished it by making the sign of the cross. His binding spellseems to have lasted until 1871, thirteen hundred and six years later, whenNessie showed again. It was an interesting year. Darwin published The Descent ofMan, Eliphas Levi’s friend Edward Bulwer-Lytton gave us The Coming Race, andLewis Carroll delighted the world with Through the Looking Glass. Each of thesebooks were death knells for Christianity, and the perfect union of thesubjective and objective universes was coming to an end. When the paranormalshowed up it could no longer be packaged easily in an overarching myth system.It was the year H. P. Blavatsky founded her first magickal group, the SocietéSpirite, in Cairo. Three years later, Charles Hoy Fort, the American writer andresearcher of anomalous phenomena, would be born, and another year later wouldsee the founding of the Theosophical Society and the birth of Edward AlexanderCrowley. The many serpent sightings in the loch have been attributed todifferent reasons. The loch is an old rift valley that was made into a lake thelast time the Earth was in the axis of Leo and Aquarius; like other rift valleys(such as the Olduvai Gorge) it lets you interact with very old forces of theEarth, and like other seismic spots weird things happen there, such aspoltergeists, apparitions, and UFOs. All of these have been reported by folk inthe area, even by Crowley himself. The magickian needs to know two things aboutthe paranormal: (1) there are places on the Earth where consensual reality islittle looser, and they amplify things the magickian is doing to change theworld; and (2) there are aspects of the world that are beyond the clockworkequations of the natural world, just as there are such parts in the magickian.The cosmos is willing to tell us that things are not always as they seem. Most writers point out the Crowley came to adulthood in the Victorian era andemphasize his rebellion against that time’s sexual mores, but fewer point outthe other rebellion going on against the British Empire, to borrow John Dee’sphrase for it. Colonialism and Christianity were having a bit of a backlash.People were naming their kids after Anglo-Saxon or Celtic heroes, and magickianswere trying to connect Masonry and ceremonial magick with Druidism. The artswere looking for the more primitive, and writers were looking for cultures withrich verbal backgrounds. One of the people deeply in the swell of this movementwas Samuel Liddel Mathers, who had begun to style himself MacGregor Mathers.When Crowley bought the forty-eight-acre estate he was signing his documentsAleister MacGregor, and he choose a property that was symbolic of Celticresistance to British rule. Boleskine House was built in the late eighteenthcentury on land acquired from the church by the Honourable Archibald Fraser, acousin of Lieutenant General Simon Fraser, who was Lord Lovat at the time.Archibald Fraser chose this site to anger Lord Lovat, who owned the land on allsides of the estate; Lord Lovat had favored the English during the JacobiteRebellion of 1745. The house faces north and west, away from England and intothe waterway that connects the heart of Scotland with the rest of the world. Idon’t know how much the church charged for the land. It hadn’t been lucky forthem; their church had burned down eight centuries before, killing an imprisonedcongregation. Crowley’s interest in the Celtic revival waned somewhat as he losthis interest in Boleskine after the death of his daughter. He did, however, pulloff a great magickal feat in the revival; he became the spiritual father of theIrish Republic. He arranged a little media event on July 13, 1915, in which heburned his English passport before the Statue of Liberty and read a Declarationof Independence for Ireland. The whole stunt was duly reported in the New YorkTimes. Here is a sample from the article: > We, the secret Revolutionary Committee of Public Safety of the Provisional> Government of the Irish Republic, hereby authorize our spokesman and delegate,> Brother Aleister Crowley, No. 418, in our name and in our behalf, to> promulgate the proclamation following:> In so grave a circumstance of human affairs as the declaration of war or> revolution, it is customary that those whose conscience and free-will alike> impel them to take up arms against other men, should state openly the causes> of their resorting to so dread efficacy of protest. If you are inclined to give no importance to this action, consider what effect aPalestinian declaration would have. Crowley had remanifested the freedom-loving,vitalist approach of the ancient Celts with this Thelemically deriveddeclaration. Boleskine was a political statement against English colonialism;you may consult your maps as to its effectiveness. The idea of the estate has a profound effect on the magickian. Magickians areselfish beings and tend to be childless as part of that expression. Crowley hadcome into the world with a great deal of money; it takes a few shekels to globetrot and buy large estates. He destroyed his inheritance on the house, histrips, money given to MacGregor Mathers, and publishing his journal, TheEquinox. One of the ways he ended his old life was spending every bit for thenew one. It also meant that he spent a good deal of his life depending on thekindness of strangers. With the death of his daughter and the dissolution of hismarriage, Crowley made his second stab at leaving a legacy with his brotherhood,the Aimage [images/00004.jpg]Aimage [images/00004.jpg], but the Aimage[images/00004.jpg]Aimage [images/00004.jpg] had a death blow dealt to it byMacGregor Mathers, who raised issues of copyright as well as certain slanders.It was tough for Crowley; he had been through the Abrahadabra formula and wasthe father of an initiatory movement, so he tried again to have real children sothat the outer world mirrored the inner. Finally he convinced himself that achild had been brought into being by intention in the person of CharlesStansfeld Jones (a.k.a. Frater Achad), and his love for this being tended tooverinflate Jones’s ego. Such bonds are easy to make as initiator or student.Crowley created the summation of his magickal life, Liber Aleph, for Jones and,when they had their falling out, tried to release the book to the world.Initially he tried to sell Boleskine for this purpose, and although this didn’twork out, he did have funds under his deathbed for the publication of thevolume. Crowley’s desire to have heirs and influence the world through Boleskineproduced some unusual results. One of these was the meeting between filmmakerKenneth Anger and Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page at a Sotheby’s auction,where each was trying to buy a pair of Crowley’s boots. Their meeting led toPage’s involvement in Anger’s films Lucifer Rising and Invocation of My DemonBrother. Page was not only a Crowley collector, he also introduced many peopleto the notion of True Will during his interviews. He owned Boleskine House foralmost twenty years, selling it in 1990. Led Zeppelin’s 1973 concert tour,immortalized in the bootleg record album From Boleskine to the Alamo, introducedthousands of people to the idea of Crowley, as well as being a recording of thelargest invocation of Thelema during a concert in (of all unlikely places) thecity of Fort Worth, Texas. (The main cut of the album, “Dazed and Confused,” hadits own series of interesting remanifestations.) Page opened a bookstore inLondon called the Equinox, which published The Book of Goetia, translated byAleister Crowley. Even the rumor of Crowley artifacts can stir up things. About a decade agorumors floated on the Internet that the Harry Ransom Center, a library on theUniversity of Texas at Austin campus, had Crowley’s hat and cane. According tothe story, Michael Aquino and Stephen Edred Flowers visited the library anddemanded the items for the Temple of Set. When the librarians turned down thissinister request, the Ph.D.s-from-hell performed a ritual that summoned a smalltornado, which damaged the building. Oddly enough, Aquino and Flowers did visitthe library on April 21, 1989, to read Crowley’s notes on the “10th Aethyr.” Imet Aquino and his lovely wife, Lilith, later that evening for the first time atFlowers’s home. A few minutes before my arrival, someone had told Aquino thatthe writer Uncle Setnakt, who was publishing small essays in the magazineBrimstone, was I. He suggested that I write more; perhaps I am the tornado . . .Oh yes, a small tornado did hit the library afterward, but not borne of anyill-will to the truly excellent staff of the HRC. Boleskine brings up the idea of the center. Crowley had been studying Islambefore the Cairo Working, and the voice told him to make Boleskine his kiblah.The kiblah is the direction of Mecca toward which one prays. Currently it istoward the Ka’ba, a shrine in Mecca, once a shrine of many gods that Mohammed,whom Crowley considered a brother of the Aimage [images/00004.jpg]Aimage[images/00004.jpg], had purified so that only one god remained. It houses theBlack Stone, which fell from heaven, and the Stone of Good Fortune. The kiblahtoward the place where god’s peace cannot be broken is the way people arereminded of the path. Allah instructs them through this physical orientation tomove in the correct path. The idea is subtle; the work of cleaning out theshrine has already been done. We don’t have to do Crowley’s work, but we can useit to break up our daily activities and be physically and mentally open to thepath. The direction is important, not the destination. Ultimately we come torealize that the direction is to an internal center. Crowley did not heed thevoice. He did not make his affairs business-like, and he did not set up his homeinto a center of peace, even though subsequent owners of Boleskine (such asJimmy Page) have commented on its deep peacefulness. Crowley chose not to makehis home the peaceful center, and suffered for it. It is in the Work of all Magithat they fail in parts of their task, to give us problems to solve. NotablyCrowley’s Work did not take a firm hold on the Earth until many of his followersdid set up peaceful homes, had kids, and had more than five dollars in theirsavings accounts. The secret is the direction with unbending intent; we don’thave the prophet’s sadness, nor know his jihad. Magi don’t go through toughlives in order that their followers will do so as well. Boleskine House is privately owned. The forces of the Æon of Horus have notcontracted into a single force powerful enough to buy the property. This willhappen, because Ipsissimus Crowley Willed it to be so. Sadly many Thelemitesbelieve it is okay to sneak onto the property. Locals do their best to telloutsiders that the house has burned down, doesn’t exist, or is unlucky to visit.Official descriptions of the property don’t mention Crowley, but you will heartales of Jimmy Page cursing a drummer to death (if you stand for a few pints inlocal pubs). Some people make the trek out to the house and, seeing only thesmall gatehouse on the road, assume that Crowley was a pauper. Others disregardthe rights of the owner and sneak into the private burial ground on the estate;perhaps they are looking for the tunnel between the house and the lich-gate,which Crowley was said to have used to prank unwanted guests. They find theirway into a small mausoleum there, its inside covered with Thelemic graffiti andwith a small cubic stone pressed into service as an altar, covered in candlewax. This is not the beginning of a Ka’ba but a misunderstanding of the kiblah. 18 image [images/00007.jpg] ABRAHADABRA The eleven-lettered word Abrahadabra is said to be the reward of the Lord ofSilence. This essay discusses how the reward is obtained, its nature, and itsuse. To obtain Abrahadabra, one must contact the Lord of Silence through any of hisfaces. The contact must be deliberate, and the attitude must be respectful. Thesoul and its parts are not enemies to be coerced by ritual threat or begged fromon bended knee. The first approach devalues the divine; the second increases thegap between the human and the divine and therefore works against initiation. Anyof the faces will utter a Word. In the first approach you turn off the internaldialogue (via sex magick with badly chosen partners, drugs, obscuring yourpersonal history by playacting, etc.). The Lord of Silence can speak into thevoid you open in yourself. This is a radical (or short) way to obtaining theRight-Hand Path. If you become a leader, choose the seeking way of the Left-HandPath, which is the best yoga because it spurs you against laziness, then Horuswill speak. If you transform yourself or a magickal partner into Ra, Ra willspeak (and you must write). If you search your childhood (real or magickal) fora formative principle, you will discover a Word of power. Many other methods canbe found, depending only on your ingenuity. The important secret is that theWord of power must be sought, received, valued, understood, and used. Abrahadabra has a dual nature. In linear time, it describes a process; taken asa simultaneous and synchronic word, it describes a cause. Looking like the wordabracadabra, the protective word that can reduce illness and fever, or in moremodern terms the word of the stage conjurer, this Word (and others of its type)expresses the Will of the magickian upon the cosmos. As a linear process,“abra,” “had,” and “abra” equal the father, Self, and father. The father is theformative principle, in seed form. It is that thing inside you that forces andempowers you to be you. It is your inheritance, from which you will rebel andfulfill. It is also the formative principle of the people around you (either theelect folk of your group or all mankind). It represents a common ground that asa magickian you must transform. “Had” of course is Self, you in rebellion fromand fulfillment of the law of the father. It is you as Satan. It is the firsttwo steps of the Van Gennep rite of passage: isolation and liminality. The laststep, “abra,” is you becoming the father. You have changed your subjectiveuniverse and now you are not only the father to yourself, you also have becomethe father to those around you since the change made in your subjective universewill have a proportional change on the objective universe, through the magickallink of your common ancestry and group ties. It is the last step of the VanGennep rite: reintegration. As a linear word it reflects both the process neededto obtain it and the model for what needs to be done to gain and re-win newWords of Power. As a simultaneous Word it points to the source of themagickian’s power. It has 11 letters and a numerical value of 418, both of whichare the signs of Nuit. It reflects that the source of power is not God but thesubjective universe of the magickian. It is the mother hidden as father and son. Abrahadabra is used to change the objective universe by focusing the changes inthe subjective universe upon the appropriate parts. It promotes change. In theearly stages of a magickian’s development it will produce unexpected results,often creating an ordeal for the magickian since the subjective universe of themagickian is largely unordered and unknown. These ordeals will clarify the Willof the magickian and strengthen him or her. Later the Word can be used by themagickian to obtain communication with his or her subjective universe byobjectifying its contents. It can be used with greater safety and power as themagickian grows, and it can be used as a yardstick to that growth. Abrahadabra is only one of many Words of Power. It is up to the magickian todiscover some of his or her own. Each word will explain the magickian’s ownprocess, as well as give models for what is to occur. 19 image [images/00007.jpg] LEFT-HAND-PATH PIONEERS The magick and philosophy of Thelema spawned a few Left-Hand-Path magickians ofnote. I’ll look at four of these briefly: Jack Parsons, Eugene Grosche, KennethGrant, and Anton S. LaVey. Each has contributed to the remanifestation of theLeft-Hand Path in the West, and each derives his technology and thinking fromCrowley. Jack (John Whiteside) Parsons was the chair of the Agape Lodge of the OTO in LosAngeles. In addition to being a great rocket engineer, he also was a greatexperimenter in magickal fields. He desired nothing short of bringing forth anew world, a world of space travel and Thelema. His contributions to solid-fuelrocket systems led to the creation of the Polaris missile by the United States,and France naming a crater for him on the dark side of the moon. Parsons’sapproach to magick and science showed a sheer recklessness that eventually madeU.S. authorities pull him away from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and leaverocket fuel development to those U.S. citizens whose patriotism and normalthinking were unquestionable, such as Wernher von Braun. Parsons desired(borrowing a great phrase from Crowley biographer Lawrence Sutin) to be the St.Paul to Crowley’s Jesus. Parsons cast himself as the Antichrist and decided tobring an end to Christianity by spreading Thelema. He fulfilled his mission viathree sorts of Work. First, he suggested to Grady McMurtry that a Thelema Lodgebe formed in San Francisco. Although Thelemic studies had existed in the BayArea for many years, the Thelema Lodge did not come into being until 1977, butit became the Grand Lodge of the OTO and the main force for the caliphate’s OTOcurrent membership of more than three thousand. Parsons’s second Working was topreach the gospel of True Will, space travel, and sexual libertinage to as manyLos Angeles science fiction writers as he could. His friends included Forrest J.Ackerman, Jack Williamson, A. E. van Vogt, Ray Bradbury, and, most importantly,Robert A. Heinlein. Williamson took Parsons’s idea of lycanthropy and developedit into a delightful werewolf novel, Darker than You Think, but it was Heinleinwho gave Parsons’s notions full voice in Stranger in a Strange Land, which inturn created its own movement in the form of the Church of All Worlds. Parsons began his career by identifying himself as the magickal son of AleisterCrowley, but he took his self-deification further. He decided to invoke a“counterpart to the god Horus” to balance the Work of the Beast; this was histhird great Work. He believed that this entity would be a living incarnation ofthe goddess Babalon. To achieve this end he hired a young sailor, L. RonHubbard, to act as his seer, modeling his initial work on the Dee-Kelly team.With young Hubbard’s help he conjured up Marjorie Cameron to act as his scarletwoman, and they performed a Working to create the living counterpart of Horus.Parsons never found the human child that the Working was designed to produce,and his life after this Working was somewhat dismal. Without a doubt hesucceeded in his desire to materialize aspects of the Æon of Horus that were notmeant to happen for thousands of years, and he wound up draining every drop ofhis blood into the graal of Babalon. His seer, L. Ron Hubbard, created areligion based on finding one’s place in the cosmos (True Will) and onexorcizing the qlippoth, the shells of the dead, which he renamed “engrams,”from the psyches of living people. This methodology leads to the acquiring ofsiddhis, or magickal powers, and is presented in a “scientific” framework. ViaMcMurtry’s lodge, Heinlein’s fiction, and Hubbard’s Church of Scientology,Parsons fulfilled his St. Paul role rather well. Nine months after the BabalonWorking, Michael Aquino was born, and Set, the ancient counterpart of Horus,would have a voice. Parsons sought to create a folk-driven Left-Hand Path thatwould wipe out Christianity, superstition, and (paradoxically) overreliance onthe ego. He thought that such a society—based on a blending of traditionalAmerican political values, Thelema, sexual communism, and super science—was theworld to come. As an old friend of mine once put it, “all the cool stuff ofNazism without oppression and death.” Equally important, but even less known to the English-speaking world, was EugeneGrosche (a.k.a. Gregor Gregorius). He founded the Fraternitas Saturni topromulgate the Word of Thelema, but not to promulgate its prophet. He metCrowley in 1925, when the First Beast had traveled to Germany seeking to spreadthe Word through existing occult groups, trying Weishaupt’s method inWeishaupt’s home country. Grosche heard the Word, and it synthesized threethings in him: the doctrine of the Will according to Nietzsche, the doctrine offate according to Jozef Hoëné de Wronski, and the ancestral Germanic idea ofpolarity. Nietzsche developed a paradigm of the Will: virtue and civilization come frommen and women who overcome the obstacles of their lives and times and thenproceed with strengthened Wills to excel in (and usually redefine) their chosenfields of endeavor. The first part of their training comes from a voluntaryjourney through what is culturally forbidden: to become the superman you mustbegin by going down. As long as such men and women are not killed bycompassion—which keeps their Wills from developing—heroes will emerge. As longas the hero is in a society that provides mysteries for him or her to seek, orvirtues to triumph, or milestones to be passed, the hero will become a king orqueen. Examples can be as different as Hank Aaron, Albert Einstein, or Susan B.Anthony. As long as the king or queen doesn’t succumb to compassion, which endsthe careers of others by softening them and making sure that they do not passtheir milestones, the king or queen becomes a godlike being able to givephilosophically to his or her race and to enjoy his or her consciousness as themechanical universe continually repeats itself. Grosche heard Nietzsche’s ideasand words echoed in the third chapter of The Book of the Law, and in hisBrotherhood of Saturn he changed the dictum of “Love is the law, love underwill,” adding “compassionless love”: Tue was Du willst ist das Gesetz, es gibtkein Gestez über tue was Du willst. Liebe ist das Gestez—Liebe unterWillen—Mitleidose Liebe. Wronski was a mathematician and political writer as well as a philosopher andoccult theorist. His work on infinite series is still respected bymathematicians today, but his approach that valued philosophical insight overformal proof is less in vogue. Wronski began Polish “messianism,” a movementthat promoted the ideas that (1) the Age of Christianity was at an end (with theHoly Spirit replacing the Christ as the leading figure); and (2) Poland, if itcould but throw off the Tsarist yoke, would be the country that would bringabout the new age. His political writings made Poland a little too warm for him,so he resettled in Paris, but his writings were helpful in bringing about thePolish revolution of 1831. He influenced many Polish authors of the nineteenthand early twentieth centuries (including Andrzej Towianski) and has had aninfluence on Poland’s rejection of communism and even on the thinking of arecent pope. Wronski is best known to the English-speaking world as theinitiator of Eliphas Levi, but he also revived a Saturn Lodge to explore hisideas of fate. Wronski, a Polish Hermeticist of the same chain that producedCopernicus and Max Theon, believed that humans could “create reality” by usingthe raw data of the elements and a secret mathematical formula. These artificialworlds would be the medium of the spiritual elite who would rule the world bythe knowledge of the coming age. Fate, which he saw in Saturn, the Indo-Europeangod of fate, passed into this sphere by the actions of enlightened men, whocould alter the world by being in accordance with the new forces. Grosche heard a powerful echo of Wronski’s concepts in The Book of the Law;surely the coming Æon of Thelema would mean a rulership of the world by aspiritual elite, who could be trained by compassionless kings in the ethicalenlightening system of Freemasonry. Grosche’s system does not have the notion ofdestroying the Self or crossing the abyss, but one of refined Working on theSelf based on the metaphors of Scottish Freemasonry and the acquisition ofmagickal power. The last part of Grosche’s world was the Germanic notion ofpolarity. The idea that the universe is formed by two visible forces—fire andice, reconciled in a space-making force of imagination—was undergoing a“scientific” revival in the early twentieth century. Hans Hörbiger’s“Welteislehre” suggested a cosmos ruled by ages of ice and fire, repulsion andattraction; the notion that an initiate could make himself out to be oppositessuch as light and dark, attraction and repulsion seemed well-matched toCrowley’s cosmology of Had, Nu, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit. Thelema was a perfect fit forthe spiritual remanifestation that was going on around Grosche. Grosche designeda system to make kings to rule in the new age. His brotherhood dominated theGerman occult world. One would be hard-pressed to find a German occult groupthat does not bear its mark. Grosche maintained some contact with the orthodoxschools of Thelema; for example, he became a member of the OTO on April 25,1951, with a certificate from a “Frau Werder-Binder,” and he published a jointmanifesto with Kenneth Grant in 1955 that stated Set-Typhon was the god of thisage. The brotherhood had remained one of the occult world’s best-kept secretsuntil certain chance meetings occurred between Stephen Edred Flowers and aformer Grand Master of the brotherhood. Flowers had been pursing academicstudies in Germany and, as often happens on the quest, found other treasures aswell. Flowers published the standard introduction to the Fraternitas Saturni(see Resources and Suggested Reading, page 330). Certain of the practices ofthat lodge entered the Temple of Set, particularly its Order of the Trapezoid. Kenneth Grant was one of Crowley’s last students. Grant was a dreamy youth whohad found the First Beast’s writing at age fourteen and sought him out when hewas twenty. In December 1944, he found the old man and became his secretary inexchange for initiation. In addition to paying bills and answeringcorrespondence, he also bought the whiskey and found drugs for Crowley—a strongchange of life from that of a rather isolated young fellow set against thebackdrop of the Battle of the Bulge, where a million young men Grant’s age werefighting. The pair studied magick page by page and practiced a form of astralvision involving ether. Grant was especially drawn to the notion ofextraterrestrial intelligence in magick. He also remanifested Crowley’s linkwith Bhavani. Crowley had sacrificed a goat to her in 1901 in Ceylon; she is theShakti (wife, power, or scarlet woman) of Shiva. She protects the followers ofthe Left-Hand Path while they copulate with her. In addition to being thearchetype of Nuit, she gives those who seek her out ultramundane sex partners(one might think of H. P. Lovecraft’s sex-goddess Shub-Niggurath) with whom theyare initiated via astral intercourse. Grant’s father took a dim a view of hisson’s involvement with Crowley and dragged him back to London six months laterto pursue a more normal path. Grant, like Crowley’s earlier secretary IsraelRegardie, was deeply changed by the experience of service. Grant, like otherCrowley theorists, went on to synthesize new elements into his practice. Hissystem is complex, and I will limit myself to three influences: Austin OsmanSpare, Gerald Massey, and H. P. Lovecraft. Grant met the trance artist Austin Osman Spare in the early fifties. Spare hadformulated a method of removing one’s Self from the world by endingself-identification with each idea that passes into one’s head—not for theRight-Hand-Path goal of tranquility, but in order to save up “free belief ” thatcould be used for magickal goals guided by specially constructed sigils. Theactivations for these operations were astral copulations with ugly and ancientwomen. This method perfectly suited the training he had already received andtied in well with his interests. Gerald Massey had been long dead when Grant found his works. One of Massey’slectures, “The Devil of Darkness in the Light of Human Evolution,” containedMassey’s notion that Set was the god of evolution and that we, poor apes that wewere, resented him for it. Massey was a Celtic revivalist, a member of An DruidhUileach Braithreachas (with the magickal name of Khemi Kha, meaning “Soul ofEgypt”). He was fascinated with the idea that Egyptian civilization was the rootof the world, writing such books as A Book of the Beginnings, The NaturalGenesis, and Ancient Egypt: The Light of the World. He and his wife, Rosina,claimed magickal powers, which he thought were part of the human evolutionaryprocess. Although longer on speculation than scholarship, he correctly adducedthat Set was a stellar deity and that Set had been the culture hero god ofearliest Egypt. This was a perfect match for Grant, who added the notion of Setas extraterrestrial evolutionist to Crowley’s assertion that ShT was the sourceof magickal power. Author H. P. Lovecraft completed the magickal system. His tales featuredcreatures that live through æons of time, sending dreams to mankind (choosing afew as an immortal elect and most as, well, lunch). In 1919 Crowley had made a painting of Lam, a figure that looks like a greyalien in UFO lore. Although Crowley never wrote about the strange figure, he didoccasionally call it is his guru. He made a gift of the painting to Grant in1945, and Grant focused on it as the representation of the evolutionary spacegod. In 1955 Grant’s ideas were announced to the world: he had discovered aSet-Sirius current and was directing the OTO toward knowledge of this current.This paper was published in England and in Germany by Grosche. It led to Grant’sexpulsion from the OTO and his founding of the Typhonian Order. Grant’s Siriuswritings were bedrock material for author Robert Anton Wilson’s The Illuminatus!Trilogy (co-written with Robert Shea). Grant had proposed a universe in whichthose from the outer spheres were as busily trying to get to this world asmagickians here were trying to get there. The hidden chiefs had become theUFOnauts. And his formulations of Spare’s work were the root of most modernchaos magick. Grant was an avid publisher from the sixties through theseventies. His publication of The Confessions of Aleister Crowley: AnAutohagiography in 1969 was the United Kingdoms’s part in the big Crowleyrevival, and his own The Magical Revival in 1972 introduced many people to hisideas as well as the occult movement in the twentieth century. Grant continuesin his own weird orbit and has a worldwide following. Grant’s polar opposite, Howard S. Levey, better known as Anton Szandor LaVey,had his brush with Thelema in the fifties. While Grant saw Thelema as a way toextend one’s Will into the great dark of outer space, Levey saw it as a greatsocial movement and cash cow. Levey had contact with Thelemic groups in the SanFrancisco area in the fifties. Never much of a joiner, the bookish musician didtake a few ideas away that were incorporated into his Church of Satan. Levey didnot give credit where credit was due, but he produced a reasonably sophisticatedsynthesis that later became crude (for reasons we will see below). He began withthe Beast’s definition of magick, “the Science and Art of causing Change tooccur in conformity with Will,” which he changed to “the change in situations orevents in accordance with one’s will, which would, using normally acceptedmethods, be unchangeable.” He took the unclothed priestess of Nuit from theGnostic Mass and made her the nude altar representing the carnal ego, whichpreserves the original symbolism rather well and packs a crowd in on Fridaynights. He took the keys of Enoch straight from The Equinox (with misspellingsintact) because of their dread and terrible nature among occultists of the time,and he “Satanized” them (by replacing the name of “god” with Shaitan). He madethem into a powerful message of the power of Satan as the force behind the falsewizards and priests who seem to rule the world, but are only pawns of the trueand hidden elite. Thus he changed Crowley’s idea that the keys broughtself-wisdom, which would then be applied to rulership, into a secret ofrulership for those powerful enough to learn the Law. He took the technology ofthe Abramelin magick and stood it on its head. Instead of the magickian needing to purify himself and repress evil desires forsix months so that he can meet his Holy Guardian Angel and command demons, Leveyposited that the repression and the hypocrisy that the magickian has lived inhave already done the work. The false morals have placed his evil side at bay,and the act of seeing through the bullshit of the world has made his ego thecommanding force of true advice. The demons are already more than willing tohelp, more as family friends than cowering servitors. In each Satanic ritual themagickian invoked the four Abramelin demons: Satan, Lucifer, Belial, andLeviathan. Levey named the four sections of the Satanic Bible for them. Thischange is the key to understanding Levey; in his system initiation consists ofovercoming the forces of the outside world, rather than using a ritual thatcould not convey a change to the Self. The Self, rejoicing in its change, wasable to invoke forces beyond the understanding of the average human, and hencethere were no rules. Magick was not a system of working out the correspondencesof the world but a quest for the most stimulating experiences possible. Thecorrect magickal ceremony worked better with the right music than the rightKabbalah; it was better to invoke Cthulhu than an angel whose name was derivedfrom hours of calculations. Levey drew from movies, Weird Tales and Unknownmagazines, and histories of music, sexology, and popular occultisms. The famousBaphomet seal of the Church of Satan, which has become synonymous in the publicmind with Satanism, was traced off the cover of a 1962 picture book about theoccult and was not even his own invention. Magick, he said, should be pragmatic.This brought about one of the greatest changes in the occult world, andironically the man who didn’t give credit probably won’t get any. Levey’s understanding of the Will meant controlling the area the magickian livedand worked in. At first this means the magickal chamber, where by selecting thecorrect sensory materials the magickian can create a sense of rulership andcontrol in himself. This sense not only empowers psychologically, it gives aclear insight of how things might be if one were not bombarded by the forces ofthe world. Second, the magickian controls his lair; he does not live with peoplehe hates, does not watch TV he loathes, and so forth. Levey’s magickal tools forthis are nostalgia and misanthropy. For magickians who desire to control more,and therefore are less offended by the ugliness of the world, there is themanipulation of images. The magickian can send his signals into the world tocondition it. It’s all about fame, baby. Levey didn’t write books with hard-to-read titles inLatin and Hebrew that were brought out by private presses. He went for massdistribution paperbacks. He didn’t travel to Egypt to invoke Horus; he invokedSatan, Lucifer, Belial, and Leviathan on The Tonight Show. He made Sammy DavisJr. an honorary warlock. He got in the movies. William Castle, the moviedirector, made him the technical advisor for Rosemary’s Baby, and he had anonscreen cameo in The Devil’s Rain, where Mexican extras chant his version ofthe Enochian keys and John Travolta melts before William Shatner. At first theChurch of Satan grew greatly in sophistication, having members like JacquesVallee, ufologist, and Michael Harner, popularizer of shamanism in the 1970s.Levey, freed from the need to relate his system to every occult system in theworld, was able to bring ideas from photography, sociology, psychology, and soforth. But Levey decided that the quest of beautifying the world was secondaryto the quest of lining his pocketbooks. Rather than allow the church to growinto a sophisticated organization, he decided that it would work better as acash source. He decided to sell off his priesthoods, which he originally hadgiven on the basis of seeing the hand of Satan behind the thoughts and being ofthe priest. The church could no longer seek an ever-more sophisticated audience,and it became a source of signals meant to draw in money. The signals that wouldhave made Howard S. Levey into a Satanic Master were made more crude. By thetime the eighties looked upon Satanism it was a thing of black T-shirts andheavy metal music and the best scapegoat since the Salem “witches.” However, ShT was not so easily overcome; Crowley had his heir in a strange way. 20 image [images/00007.jpg] AQUINO In 1968 Rosemary’s Baby had its premier. Anton LaVey (Howard S. Levey) wasbasking in the fame of the moment. William Castle had made “Pray For AntonLaVey” buttons, and LaVey arrived at a local theater dressed in robes andsurrounded by hooded cultists. They brushed past a young second lieutenant namedMichael Aquino, whom fate had prepared for an awakening. Aquino had just gotten his BA degree in political science (from the Universityof California, Santa Barbara) and was enjoying the June night as his time tohead off to Fort Bragg was nigh approaching. A young overachiever, he had beenthe national commander of the Eagle Scouts three years before, and he hadenlisted during a very unpopular war. He had turned down a nomination to WestPoint because he was more interested in the course material at the University ofCalifornia. He had developed a threefold approach to the cosmos. For the inner,subjective side of the world he had chosen existentialism, with its quest ofbeing; for the objective universe he had chosen materialism, with its faith inscience and progress; and for the human realm between the two he had chosenpolitical science as the place where human freedom and progress could be mostefficiently balanced and perhaps enhanced. He lacked only the spark of mysteryto turn this synthesis into Setian philosophy, and LaVey’s bald head was thespark. Instead of contemplating the relationship between male pattern baldnessand the occult, he just wondered who the hell these people were. On leave in March 1969, Aquino attended a lecture and Working of the Church ofSatan. He was impressed with the person of Anton LaVey, the individualist natureof the philosophy, and the experimental outlook. He didn’t know the roots of thelast two qualities, but he applied the ideas and soon had a sense of the forcethat worked on a cosmic scale for the same personal refinement that he wasseeking. The United States government sent him off to Vietnam, where histraining as a psychological warfare specialist placed him in the heart of agun-and-mind war. Not far from the spot where the First Beast had finished theAbramelin Working, he sought to create a commentary and response to JohnMilton’s Paradise Lost. Therein he discovered a special magickal power, that bydissolving the day-to-day Self in the subjective universe of another with theintention of rebelling against that universe, Works of transpersonal power couldbe created. He had developed the mystic’s method that Steven Katz talks about,but on an individualist level; one need not pick the holy text of the hostculture, merely a text that stimulates the Worker. This perfect blend of anage-old technique of mankind and the pragmatic magick of Anton LaVey led to thecreation of The Diabolicon, a narrative of mankind from the point of view of itsdaemonic initiators. Despite such setbacks as part of the text being blown up byenemy fire, he sent the work back to LaVey, who began calling him his “devil’sson,” mirroring the relationship between MacGregor Mathers and Crowley. TheDiabolicon introduced the concept of the black flame, the “force” of magick thatallows humans to transcend the natural order. This concept had already beenpartially articulated by Crowley and Massey as ShT. The natural order is not simply the survival programming that a human ishardwired with. One’s natural order is the place where the atomizing forces ofsociety push you. You may be a kid in a poor black neighborhood in Paterson, NewJersey, but you can become a significant artificial intelligence researcher; youmay be lazy middle-class kid in Dallas and become one of the world’s leadingrunologists; you may be a street kid in San Francisco and become a leadinganthropologist by overcoming the natural order. The black flame was seen as agift from the daemonic race to the human one, and a gift was expected inexchange so that humans would cross the gulf of evolution and become members ofthat race. This idea of evolution and overcoming that is tied to magick wouldpower the Church of Satan until 1975. This didn’t happen because of LaVey’sphilosophical goals; he simply realized that Aquino would work hard and made himthe editor and chief writer for the Church of Satan’s organ The Cloven Hoof.Aquino had to research interesting topics and present them. His many essays ontopics ranging from Chinese secret societies to the real-world basis of some ofLovecraft’s stories are fun and interesting reading. He came across the writingsof Crowley, who was undergoing a revival because of Grant’s publishing efforts.Crowley’s system lacked the pragmatic approach of Anton LaVey, but it did havean end goal. Crowley, following Nietzsche’s (and Matthers) rediscovery of theword, chose “Ipsissimum”—“I am the very most I-like person existing in the worldof I-ness.” One could compare this to Robert Chambers’ “King in Yellow”—a signof enthroned I in a world that reflects the Self’s Self-Creation. This notion ofan intact self in a world created by its action seemed to be the same goal thatLaVey called the “satanic master.” Aquino read as much of the First Beast as hecould, and the influence is obvious in his essays on the Church of Satan’sdegree system. The Church of Satan’s system was not derived from the OTO andAimage [images/00004.jpg]Aimage [images/00004.jpg] system, but it did havecertain resonances with that system. The satanist I° was a neophyte. The warlockor witch II° corresponded to the adept grades. The priest or priestess III° wassaid to be in contact with the force that had been revealed in The Diabolicon;Satan’s touch was there. This constant eating of the apple did not destroy theego, but allowed it to reshape itself in a radically new form. This stage wouldbe akin to the sephiroth DAATH. The Magister grade IV did not represent thedestruction of the ego, but rather (as in the Fraternitas Saturni) a godlikestate of consciousness that worked on the natural order, both within andwithout. The Magus V° grade was the bringer of a new concept to the world. By 1975 Anton LaVey had encountered the harsh truth that all serious occultistsface: the ideas you put into the world have a huge transforming effect, but theydon’t bring hard currency. So he went with the American current instead ofagainst it; he looked at his students as his customers, and he decided to raisethe price. The signs of the III° had been determined by LaVey: one who showedthe power of the Prince of Darkness by his or her influence on others had beenthe goal. The new goal was power in the horizontal world. Could you give theChurch of Satan, which was wholly owned by LaVey, gifts of money, property,fame, and so forth? LaVey wrote up a statement to this effect, gave it to Aquinoto run in The Cloven Hoof, and Aquino refused. He didn’t feel the evolutionaryforce that he had come to experience if Satan chose his priests and priestesseson the basis of cash. On June 10, 1975, Michael Aquino resigned from the Church of Satan. He had beendoing magickal investigations with Dee’s keys and also the image of Set. On thenight of the solstice of that year, he invoked the Prince of Darkness todiscover what needed to be done to protect the forces that had been sent intothe world in 1966. The Santa Barbara Working, which produced The Book of ComingForth by Night, was Set’s response to his questions. In the seventy-second yearof the Æon of Horus, Set affirmed that he is the force that has given theprinciple or perhaps the potential of Mindful Evolution to mankind. Theterminology of the Judeo-Christian era and the elaborate magickal formulas thatgrew under that ice were no longer needed. The direct desires of the human beingto transcend the natural order could be communicated by the entity that createdtranscendence. The entity sent the Word Xeper (pronounced “kheffer”) into theworld. As it perhaps had been in 1904 with the word coph, the Self was urged togrow and transform and create a world of its own actions to live in and to seekothers of its kind in this world to aid in that process as well as to enjoy asfriends. This Working explained the relationship of humans to the force thatmakes them evolve and is therefore feared by them. It explained the relationshipof magick to self-change and the need for a temple. I’ll deal with the latterfirst. A temple is a place where one comes consciously seeking the sacred and anothercomes consciously to give it freely. This idea is best known in tantra: the“secrets” of a mantra are not in its pronunciation but in its receptions. Onecan find books with thousands of mantras written down, but that does not givethem to you. Only the transmission from the transformed human to the personseeking transformation accomplishes this. The Temple of Set began with such atransmission and exists in the ability to continue that transmission. Onedoesn’t simply get Xeper by hearing about or reading about it. It must be heardfrom someone who was changed by it. Now, let’s consider that idea of change in Aquino’s formulation. His is not amere synthesis of Massey and Nietzsche, Plato and Crowley. Let’s look at theorigins of the idea, what Setians mean by it, and the implications of thatmeaning. We inherited the terms “lesser black magick” and “greater black magick”from the Church of Satan. Lesser black magick (LBM) was the magick ofmanipulating other human beings to accept your commands by bypassing theirrational Selves. Greater black magick (GBM) was manipulating the collective Willof others to restructure their society to mirror your Will—to make the worldyour lair. The Church of Satan did not see GBM as initiatory in nature. Anythingas objective as self-change did not come from the antics of the ritual chamber.If you wanted more power, you worked hard and got more power. Magick was thereto ease the way because it was a natural faculty of the natural-born leaders,although the methods of teaching that faculty were in the hands of (presumably)powerful elites. Setians disagree with this analysis. We do not see simple advancement in theworld as gaining more being. We see advancement in the world as a necessaryprelude to gaining more being, and that magick can not only help in one’sadvancement but also in gaining more being. Let us consider “being.” We think ofbeing as an insubstantial state unaffected by the laws of time and space. Wecall the part of ourselves that has being “the psyche.” The material world hasno being; it has properties that being may use to enhance itself. The materialworld not only includes obvious things like cars and cats, it also includes yourthoughts and feelings. A thought, which is a biochemical state, or a feeling,which would be measured by blood chemistry, skin galvanic changes, breath rate,and so forth, are as material as a coffee cup. These things are not part of yourpsyche. Your psyche has the power to exchange the essence of its realm with thesubstantial part of you. When this happens there is a profound change in bothrealms. Many humans may do GBM; however, what they bring to their psyches limitsthe kind of change and exchange that can occur. If a devout Muslim does GBM, hewill see his results as the voice of Allah. If a nun does it, she will seeJesus. The psyche can only change what is presented to it. This is why the Temple of Set stresses developing correct models of theuniverse. The more you know, the more that can be wrought in you by you. The Temple exists because we were given the challenge by Set to help humans havethe best understanding possible so that their psyches and their material Selvescan receive the most benefit from these exchanges. We are a sounding board and amutual research society. If we push the limits of our understanding we canachieve more. There are two other aspects of GBM besides understanding. These are openness andexperience. GBM is not cheerleading. We don’t go into the chamber expecting to have ourviews reinforced (or even simply challenged). We are seeking a quantum leap. Webelieve that becoming happens when the insubstantial part of ourselves works onthe substantial part. Our personal mandate is an exact duplicate of the infernalmandate: we bring the power of our insubstantial selves into this world, just ason a larger scale we collectively bring the power of the Prince of Darkness intothis world. We must be open to the experience we unleash. When we hit the bodyon the slab with the lightning, we have to be ready to deal with the monster. Ifwe are so full of the prejudices of this world that we cannot accept the newworld, we soon find that what we have invoked is going to split us in two. Ifyour GBM tells you that you have a mission, you can’t decide to avoid the workin the mundane world. The sort of creature that Crowley called the “blackbrother” isn’t us; it is the creature that does not pay heed to the forces thathe or she has invoked. You can’t ask for a destiny and than not work for it. In addition to openness we need experience for our GBM to work. GBM only worksin a meaningful matrix. If you expect a destiny to unfold, you have toexperience the world. You have to have education, travel, and skills you havedeveloped in the world. Going back to our monster analogy, you’re just not goingto terrify those villagers if you build your creature out of puny parts. Your“power” as a magickian is your power as a human being. Many people try to bypassthis hard truth, thinking surely if they (we) can just get better spells, agreat destiny will come of its own. However, the prepared mind, the healthybody, and hard work are still required. The benefits of GBM are approached philosophically (although it can and doeshave pragmatic benefits). Unless we understand Xeper, we can’t understand why weneed GBM or what it does to the objective forces of our life. However, if wecome to understand Xeper, that is to say, we become adept, we can understand atleast the theory of GBM when we are awake. The transpersonal aspects of GBM are a little harder to understand. Sure, we cansee that we can enliven our manifest lives with the force of our unmanifestedlives, but what of the world? When do we get to be the magickians that werepromised in the Age of Satan under the term “satanic master”? The principles arethe same. If you wish your GBM to work on a transpersonal scale—if you want totransform the lives of others by a touch of the unmanifest—you needunderstanding, openness, and experience in the people you wish to change. Here is how you get these things. You can create understanding in others bylearning how to communicate. You learn how to speak, how to write, how to makefilms, how to paint, and so forth. You have to be able to inform and persuadepeople so that your GBM can effect them. You can’t simply say a spell and thinkthat people will be smarter, but you can always use sorcery to make peoplestupider. You have to use the methods that mankind has been developing since thegift unleashed the possibilities of GBM on a transpersonal scale, that is tosay, since religion was invented. You can create openness in people by becoming a leader. If people trust you as aboss, a teacher, or a commentator, then they will be open to what you have tosay. You wouldn’t be impressed with the words of a guy living in a dumpster inthe same way as you would with those of your favorite college professor. Youneed more than position to have people open to you; you also have to be a fairleader, a wise woman, a reliable thinker. Last, you have to have experience in the people you wish to change. You can’tlead an army of morons to greatness. Now, you can lead an army of morons if youdon’t care about making them greater. There are various folk-based approaches tothe Left-Hand Path, and they will end in smoking ruins. Stalin couldn’t createSoviet man, Hitler didn’t do so hot with Germany, and Pol Pot and Kim Jong-ilgrew no supermen. Only those who can hear the Word, think the Word, and perform the Word in waysbeyond themselves can do GBM on a transpersonal basis. But if you can meet all of these criteria, you can Work GBM on more thanyourself. Then you have to have even more understanding (of how your GBM fits into thecurrent matrix of mankind) and openness (to possibilities that are by definitionbeyond your imagination), and you have to have experience (because everything inyour life will be taxed). When Michael Aquino performed the Santa Barbara Working in 1975 CE X AS,*7[CR%21XKH88GDSZ52D3DFGXSBK3FPMAAQE_split_022.html#filepos912822] this wasaccomplished. He changed not only himself but also everyone who heard, thought,and performed the Word. Thousands of people have been changed. Some didn’t likeit, some wanted validation rather than change, and some wanted the change sothat they could move on to other tasks. Some honored the change, and others hidit for their own reasons. But all of them are still standing inside of thatWorking. They can expand it but not erase it. Michael Aquino and Eugene Grosche (a.k.a. Gregor Gregorius) were the heirs whostressed the sacred, the tradition of initiation. The other heirs were exemplarsof the modern world, who believed that simply putting the information into theworld without the links of living humans who strive to manifest it is enough.Aquino turned his eyes to the ancient source of human evolution, as did Grant,but did not choose to use the substances of the natural order to attempt totranscend it; in this, he breaks the most strongly with the First Beast.Aquino’s method does not use the forces of the natural order, as did Crowley orLaVey, to become more than that order. The original version of this text had a short chapter 11 with a Setian ritual. Amore useful version of this ritual has been re-Worked and is presented below asa Thelemic sumble (see THE THELEMIC SUMBLE[CR%21XKH88GDSZ52D3DFGXSBK3FPMAAQE_split_020.html#filepos883637]). "},{"pageContent":"An Afterword to “The Force and the Fire” THE ÆON OF HORUS The Æon of Horus came into this world in an outward form in 1904. Its prophethad the ingredients. He had found a language, he had manifested a desire, he hadthe time to pursue the work, and he had been disillusioned by his humanteachers. All of these experiences are available to anyone who wants them, andI’ll talk about them later. Most of what Crowley said, other people had beensaying for a while. Certainly most of it is commonplace now. Most of the inkspilled in his name furthered the spectacle of who he was, rather than what hemeant. Why should anyone bother to look at him? Change comes from secret places, but it is only effective at certain times. Theold system must be falling apart, so its death throes are changed by Will intobirth pains. Crowley was the synthesizer who took many streams of change andplaced them into the world. The problem with being a magickian is that the worlddoes not recognize you as a change agent. Magickians are quaint figures, notpeople to emulate when picking a career or a life. Usually they wind up poor,and often bitter. This is about to change. It is happening in part due to Crowley’s Work. It is not considered weird forpeople to seek themselves in a variety of spiritual paths. You can speak of aninterest in magick without your friends calling for an exorcist or a shrink. Soif you are a student of history you might feel some gratitude to this man. Butgratitude is one of the weakest emotions for humans. The reasons that people will look at Crowley are basic human desires. We wantpower over ourselves and our environment, and we want to know how both we andthe universe really work. Most people will miss the boat. They may lack a goodeducation, so when they encounter Crowley they are too impressed and are glad tolet him do their thinking for them. They may lack creativity, so when theyencounter Crowley they are at a loss to innovate. But most often they lack the one thing the Æon of Horus needs. They lack thebelief that they can do anything to make themselves happier, wiser, or morepowerful. They are trapped in the Æon of Osiris waiting for some divine thingoutside of themselves to take care of them. They lack Will. Crowley directed a new current into the world. We see it everywhere.“Self-empowerment” is our shibboleth—often said, seldom done. Crowley makes a pact with us in the name of the sun, the local star of Nuit. Itis as follows: improve yourself and agree that you will improve others, and hismagickal system will work for you. He offered his personal cosmos as a method,but it is not the only method. If you as a person go beyond materialism, simplephysical pleasure, the pursuit of ego aggrandizement, and the games of theintellect to find your way to a sense of beauty, you will be informed by thatbeauty, and the world will simply work better for you. Many more people findthis path than find the path of magick, and magick can ensnare you in intellect,ego, pleasure, or the material—very well leading to a more exotic form of sleep. Crowley’s genius lies in starting a current that makes the above miraclepossible. Hence his Law is for all. The mystic and magickian need a language. In a traditional society this is givenvia established paths of initiation. However, these arts had been lost in theformula of the Æon of Osiris, when the subjective and objective realms were seenas one, under the control of a god that stood for societal norms, loss offreedom, and the mechanical laws of the objective universe. So Crowley had tofind a language, and he choose those systems that empower the seeker: theEnochian system, Abramelin, Goetia, Freemasonry, yoga, and so forth. He killedthe universe of Descartes, which assumed the thinker is held in place by theactions of God, and instead gave us a universe where the seeker is the maker ofgods. Magickians are both free to choose their tools and limited in choosingtools that require effort and aim at personal liberation. Crowley found hislanguage in the occult and in the belief of science as a remedy for human ills.The magickian need not turn his or her back on the world of progress but insteadsees that world both as a testing ground (of rationality and proof) and as anever-expanding base of power wherein ancient dreams are achieved by psychicalmeans. The Cairo Working took that language and both restored and destroyed it,as true mystical receptions do. Uncle Al made the wish for wisdom. Once this desire is manifested by thought,deed, and speech, it will come about. It frames what you are looking for.Hundreds of people had passed by Stele 666, but Crowley’s world was configuredso that he was able to receive Rose’s advice. Humans have occasional momentswhen they actually can make choices, yet usually they choose to choose nothing.But when the choice to learn is made, humans are stuck with it. It can bring agreat deal of happiness and power and a great deal of sorrows and being strippedto your essentials. It will always bring individuality. The power that answersthat wish wants its universe enriched by you enriching your own. When that gateis opened, anything may happen. You may protest that if getting to learn is assimple as making a wish, why aren’t there thousands or millions of people whoget this? Doesn’t everyone reading this book want to make that wish? The answeris no, they want power or fame or material goods or cleverness. The last is thebiggest trap for the would-be magickian. It is easier to be knowing than to seekknowledge. Crowley had the time to pursue the Work. Most people don’t, but it’s not becausewe aren’t born rich. It’s because we are unwilling to make the space for theWork in our lives. Crowley bought his house on Loch Ness. It may be that all thetime we have is two hours a week between jobs and that all our space is a littlealtar made of cardboard. Then that is all that is needed. Where we fail is thatwe don’t let the Work make our choices. We buy a house but not because it willhelp our introspection. We hang out with people but not to aid our work orconsciously give ourselves a break from it. We take classes at school but don’tmake room on our schedule for something that might deepen us. Crowley madeexternal time for the Work, spent money on it, and let it guide his life.Investments pay off; we live in a capitalist universe. Crowley had made thecommitment before he went to the Victorious City, and then (as is almost alwaysthe case), in a moment without external Work, the payoff occurred. Human teachers had disillusioned Crowley. This is a sad part about initiation.Early on if we are strong we can attract a teacher. He or she is wise andknowledgeable and has great advice for your growth. In reality we project thebest parts of ourselves on that person, and his or her magickal link with otherpowers helps us in our self-transformation. However, if you make a human a god,you make all parts of that human a god (in your subjective universe), and his orher flaws are magnified a thousandfold. So you think your teacher has fallenfrom grace, and you set out to avenge your teacher’s cause in spite of him orher. This is the Abrahadabra formula. You make your contact with the higherpowers. This process and ordeal repeats itself. It happens with the personalitythat you make yourself. You will become so wise and good that you will do yourown terrible things. If you discover your own flaws by the same process ofmagnification, you will have a chance to course-correct before you become theguru-thug. If not you may still help people in the abstract but screw up thelives of anyone close to you. Last, the process is played through with yourfavorite students, on whom you project idealized pictures of yourself until theyfall from your grace. This is very common; magickians are terrible judges ofcharacter because they are looking for sponges to soak up their goodness. If youpass through all of these trials, you can integrate your work with the world andperform the enrichment that power wishes you to perform. We can do all of the things Uncle Al did, because he blazed a trail. There is nothing in his vision of the cosmos that requires us to do so; as Ipointed out above, many people find their true Will without the slightestknowledge of 666. But if you want to forge your link with the power, you can doso with greater ease if you look into the lives of the various openers of theway. Crowley’s view of æons was a progressive view. He saw them as human ages. Butæons are always manifest. They choose their personae by tasks. There are certainthings the æon needs, just as your body needs a liver and lungs. People electthemselves to that task, and if they are successful, their Work links up withthat of others. Crowley was able to come up with a list of Magibefore him who hefelt were part of his magickal order. The outer forms of these ages come aboutwhen a human is able to synthesize these streams so that other humans don’t haveto put it all together. We call these people Magiafter a tribe of Persian ritualspecialists. Magi are not philosophers, but they can create contact with certainforces so that certain types of philosophies and actions are much more likely tooccur. Crowley did not grasp this, because he could never allow for the notionthat the universe inside his head was not the same thing as the universe outsidehis head, so he saw æons as being heralded by the place of our sun and theprecessional wobble of the Earth. He raised Earth up; it is up to us to pulldown heaven. "},{"pageContent":"Appendix Inner and Outer Mysteries ELEVEN CLUES My suggestions here for activating Thelema in your life are starting points;proceed and you will find better advice for yourself from your own strivings. 1. Reread this book after you have tried a few of the notions below. 2. Find a wonderful lover. This will determine your happiness more than any other deed. Find one who makes you grow and inspires you to be loving. The thoughts of Paschal Beverly Randolph (see Paschal Beverly Randolph [CR%21XKH88GDSZ52D3DFGXSBK3FPMAAQE_split_021.html#filepos897955]) give a better understanding of love in the context of the Will than do Crowley’s. 3. Follow your bliss. The money will come. 4. Find your mystery. Find something that inspires you more and more as you delve into it. Pick an aspect of the hidden and seek after it. Do real research, experiment, and travel. Don’t be happy with the simple data you find in popular occult books. Recall Stephen Edred Flowers’s Law of reyn til runa, which equals 93 by rune tally. The difference between outer and inner mysteries is an illusion; as you seek after the mysteries, you will find your true Will. 5. Seek leadership. Horus is the pharaoh, the divine king. To plumb the depths of Thelema you must become a leader and struggle with the ethics of power as well as indulging in its joys. 6. Find a group. The real challenges of self-development don’t come to armchair occultists. The frictions of a group, the examples of living inspiration, and the responsibilities of running the group will teach you a great deal about Will. The OTO, the Temple of Set, and certain modern examples of the Golden Dawn are excellent training grounds. 7. Found a group. In addition to the discipline you may learn as you follow a group’s initiatory process, you need to see what it is to lead a group. Can you avoid the perils of guruship? Can you discover how to inspire others? Take out an ad; get some copies of Robert Anton Wilson’s Quantum Psychology: How Brain Software Programs You and Your World or Glenn Tinder’s Political Thinking: The Perennial Questions. Practice the Thelemic sumble (see THE THELEMIC SUMBLE), and discover what it is to be Horus. 8. Learn to use the Thoth Tarot deck. Crowley’s divinatory tool will help you relate his philosophy, your desires, and your world together in practical ways. Philosophy doesn’t sit on the bookshelf; it is at your side even when you are trying to buy tires. With The Tarot Handbook, published in 1997, Angeles Arrien created a good book that takes the practice of the Thoth Tarot deck beyond the simple world of fortunetelling. 9. Travel. Crowley followed the example of “Alastor.” You should as well; travel broadens the mind. Take chances; go off the beaten path. 10. Mention Crowley. Thelema is a philosophy that may accelerate the evolution of mankind. Don’t preach on the street corner, but tell your friends about what inspires you. Make mention of Crowley in your college papers, blogs, and conversations. 11. Practice magick. Find and use Crowley’s rituals, especially “Liber Had” to understand what it is to be Nuit and “Liber Nu” to understand what it is to be Hadit. Receive communion at a Gnostic Mass, and practice the Thelemic sumble. THE THELEMIC SUMBLE The sumble was a magickal practice of Vikings before going off into battle. Ituses metanarratives (incorporating the stories of gods or men into one’s life)and boasts of prior deeds and make oaths of deeds yet to be done. It is custommade for the principle of overcoming. It blends philosophy, life planning, andmagick into a single activity. The sumble is best done face-to-face, but it iseffective via Skype or other media. No one may pass from any round of toasts.After its performance, the Workers would leave the area in silence, so it workswell to end meetings. The ritual can be altered to fit with the styles andtraditions of the group involved, from Wiccan coven to Church of Satan grotto.All that is needed is a commitment to the Will. If practiced regularly—say, fourtimes a year—it will teach each Worker about the nature of his or her Will, howthings come into being in the world, and the powers of brotherhood. The first round of toasts is to principles; Workers will speak of an idea (or agod or goddess) that is needed to focus and empower the Will. The second roundis a tribute to a hero who exemplifies the principle. This can be a living ordead person. This is not wholesale praise for the person, just for how well heor she illustrated the principle in his or her life. The third round is a boastor brag concerning a recent activity. The fourth round is an oath of a futuredeed. All are honor-bound to help their seatmates in their oaths if they may doso ethically. The leader makes the first toast in each round; this positionshould be alternated throughout the group. The drink may be served from apitcher, a passed bottle, or a Viking-style drinking horn. The liquid shouldreflect the tastes and customs of the Workers. In the center of the table, the Sacred Trapezoid of the Freemasons should bedisplayed. Its proportions should be 10-5-6-5. It should be painted with acheckerboard pattern. Depending on the understanding of the Workers, a figuremay be painted in red in the center. Some suggestions for this figure are aninverse pentagram, 666, 93, 418, 118, and so forth. Otherwise, the chamber may be plain or dressed according to the will of theWorkers. The leader of the ritual should have a gavel with which he opens andcloses the ritual by knocking on the table (again a nod to Freemasonry). Here are examples of the steps in conducting a typical sumble. 1. Knocking XXX–XXX–XXXXX 2. The leader speaks: “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.” 3. The Workers place their left hands on the Trapezoid. One among them says the opening words: > We gather in Love to Work our Wills. That which we honor grows in might and> main. We honor the Earth and all creatures that dwell on her. We honor the> Water and pledge to work for its purity, for it makes up our bodies and our> tears. We honor the Air through which we send Dreams this night. We honor the> sacred Fire, which blazes in brilliance and darkness onto the glory of desire.> We honor the principle of seeking that we may find our true Wills. We honor> the Beast from the Sea who brought the Law of Thelema. We honor the Beast from> the Earth who brought the Law of Xeper. We honor the gods mankind has made to> serve them. We honor the heroes who inspire us to greater deeds. We honor our> brothers and sisters of this sumble and pledge ourselves to their aide. We> honor ourselves for what we have wrought and what we are about to do in> expression of our true Will. > 4. The liquid is sanctified: “Odin remade the world from Ymir’s body according> to His Will. He invites us to do likewise by drinking from this cup hallowed> with the runes: ansuz, laguz, uruz. This ale reminds us of the taste of our> Wills.” > 5. The leader begins the first toast: (For example) “I toast the principle of> Wyrd. As Beowulf tells us, ‘Wyrd will often help the doughty earl if he is> uncursed.’ Hail Wyrd!” Everyone toasts a principle or god/goddess that fuels> the Will. > 6. The leader begins the second round, which is dedicated to heroes: “I raise> my glass to Stephen Edred Flowers, who gave us the Law of mystery. Reyn til> runa! Hail Stephen Edred Flowers! Hail 93!” Everyone toasts his or her hero. > 7. The leader begins the third round of toasts, which is dedicated to boasts:> “I raise this glass to me. I wrote Overthrowing the Old Gods and honored the> First Beast in my own way. It was a tough journey with many unforeseen tests> to my Will. Hail Don!” Everyone toasts himself or herself. > 8. The leader begins the fourth round, the toast of oaths: “I raise this glass> in pledge to my future self. I will write a strong Lovecraftian novel set in> Central Texas. Hail my future self!” Everyone speaks his or her oath for a> future deed. > 9. The last person to toast sums things up: “We have heard and will remember> the oaths of this night. Our Wills now call the needed events from the> unmanifest. Our Will is 31. It is AL, the god of pure Will. Our Will is ShT,> Shaitan, the god of desire, who rules the age of fire. Our Will is 31. It is> AL, the nothingness in which all things arise. Our Will is 93, and we awaken> Thelema in ourselves and in the minds of those who dream this night.” With> these final words, he or she flings some of the sanctified liquid into the air> with his or her left hand, so that drops of it may fall in the open mouths of> initiates in the yet-to-be. > 10. Another person speaks: “Our Work is wrought. Our Will commingled with the> gods, the ancestors, the demons who now depart and place hidden treasures in> our way. We are the sparks of intimate fire that Aleister Crowley called into> being with his Word. We are the emerald dawn of freedom, and we bless our> brothers and sisters wherever they Work. Love Is The Law! Love under Will!” > 11. Another knocking XXXXXX–XXXXX. The leader speaks: “Go in peace; let your> heart burn with the black flame of desire, and let your veins freeze with the> white ice of pure Will. Be open to mystery, joy, love, and power.” All rise, shake hands or give other signs of affection, and depart into thenight.

BOOKS Any book read with the spirit of Thelema becomes a Thelemic book; Crowley tookdeep inspiration from Shelley’s poem and a funerary talisman. I thought ofincluding several books that could deepen the reader, such as Nassim NicholarTaleb’s The Black Swan, which offers thoughts about history and economics thatcould help the Thelemite understand the chaos of the world, or GeorgesBataille’s Literature and Evil, which could open the magickian to certaincurrents in the works of Bronte, Baudelaire, Blake, Michelet, Kafka, Proust,Genet, and de Sade. I focused on the life Crowley, the larger current he was anexemplar of, certain results of his Work, and certain techniques that will aidthe Thelemite. Of course one should begin with Crowley’s own writings. I assume that my readershave already ventured there, but if not begin with the 1996 “popular edition” ofThe Book of the Law, which has the First Beast’s own thoughts on The Book of theLaw. Afterward, you should follow up with Magick: Liber ABA, which is the primerfor Thelemic magick. Third, read Crowley’s spectacular The Book of Thoth, whichintroduces his last great Work, the Thoth Tarot deck, which embodies his maturesynthesis of Thelema, occult lore, and a powerful divinatory tool. Perdurabo: The Life of Aleister Crowley by Richard Kaczynski (Berkeley: NorthAtlantic Books, 2010) Without a doubt the cornerstone of Crowley studies. Written from an initiatedperspective but dedicated to objective facts, this book is essential in seeinghow the Word unfolded in the life of Crowley. Do What Thou Wilt: A Life of Aleister Crowley by Lawrence Sutin (New York: St.Martin’s Griffin, 2002) Sutin takes on Crowley as a cultural phenomenon, not as a magickian or con man.He fairly explains Crowley’s actions in the social matrix they occurred. This isa good book for understanding how the world perceives Thelema. Paschal Beverly Randolph: A Nineteenth-Century Black American Spiritualist,Rosicrucian, and Sex Magician by John Patrick Deveney (Albany: SUNY Press, 1997) Randolph proclaimed a doctrine of the Will interlaced with sex magick, mirrormagick, and visualization techniques that had a huge influence on the GoldenDawn, the OTO, and the Fraternitas Saturni. He was part of that great æonicmovement that blended East and West as well as emphasized the importance of theSelf in its own evolution. He died in 1875, the year of the First Beast’s birth,and is in many ways his spiritual father. The Great Oom: The Improbable Birth of Yoga in America by Robert Love (New York:Viking, 2010) Pierre Bernard brought radically Left-Hand-Path tantra to San Francisco and thenintroduced respectable yoga to wealthy Americans in the East. This book offers agreat social history of this East-West Master, who mixed eroticism and yoga.Crowley was not alone in birthing the Æon of Horus. To understand the æon in atranspersonal fashion, look to others who did the Work and see its branches inthe current world. Into the Center of the Fire: A Memoir of the Occult 1966–1989 by James Wasserman(Lake Worth, Fla.: Ibis Press, 2012) Wasserman gives a great warts-and-all picture of Thelemic initiation. Wassermanwas a frontline fighter in the great manifestation of Crowley’s philosophy. Inaddition to a good portrait of a loving father and husband, we also receive athoughtful explanation of how Thelema deepens character and an answer to thatquestion, “What is it that magickians do anyway?” Lords of the Left-Hand Path: Forbidden Practices and Spiritual Heresies byStephen Edred Flowers, 2nd edition (Rochester, Vt.: Inner Traditions, 2012) Flowers gives an historical overview of the Left-Hand Path from the EgyptianCult of Set, the Yezidi Devil Worshippers, the Assassins, the Neoplatonists, theHellfire Club, the Bolsheviks, the occult Nazis, and several heretical Sufi,Zoroastrian, Christian, and Muslim sects, and takes his study into modern timeswith H. P. Blavatsky, the Marquis de Sade, Austin Osman Spare, Aleister Crowley,Gerald Gardner, Anton LaVey, and Michael Aquino. The Left-Hand Path aspects ofNazism and Gurdjieff ’s fourth way are discussed. The Fraternitas Saturni—or Brotherhood of Saturn: An Introduction to itsHistory, Philosophy, and Rituals by Stephen Edred Flowers (Woodbury, Minn.:Llewellyn Publications, 2011) The Fraternitas Saturni was a German magickal lodge that adopted Thelema as itswatchword in a completely Left-Hand Path orientation. Flowers gives an accountof this influential group using internal publications. This book is a greatexample of the Left-Hand Path current in the First Beast’s Work and a usefulexamination of the lodge that shaped Germany’s modern occult scene. TheBrotherhood of Saturn influenced German occultism as much as the Golden Dawnshaped occultism in the English-speaking world. Uncle Setnakt’s Essential Guide to the Left-Hand Path by Don Webb (Smithville,Tx.: Rûna-Raven Press, 1999) In this book I offer a practicum for the Left-Hand Path. The Essential Guideopens the door to the darkly resplendent worlds of the Left-Hand Path. Partphilosophical treatise, part ontological stand-up comedy, and part magickalpracticum, this book makes clear what many other books have only hinted at. Forpeople with wit and perseverance, this book is a training manual for supermenand superwomen. I have been a practitioner of the Left-Hand Path since the 1970sand am the former High Priest of the Temple of Set, the world’s largestLeft-Hand-Path organization. Political Thinking: The Perennial Questions by Glenn Tinder (Boston: Little,Brown and Company, 1986) Thelema is a political philosophy. This handy little book does not indoctrinatestudents but shows them how to think politically; in addition the answers ofgreat philosophers to these perennial questions are traced. By doing the work ofanswering the questions, this book will open your mind in many ways. Quantum Psychology: How Brain Software Programs You and Your World by RobertAnton Wilson (Tempe: New Falcon Publications, 1990) Written by one of the world’s smartest and funniest Thelemites, this bookprovides a series of exercises for group and individual Work to help youunderstand how aspects of your brain and language may hide and/or create realityfor you. Wilson draws on many of the products of the Æon of Horus—quantummechanics, relativity, non-Euclidean geometries, non-Aristotelian logic, andgeneral semantics—to empower readers to pull the wool off their eyes. Nietzsche: An Introduction to the Understanding of His Philosophical Activity byKarl Jaspers (Baltimore: John Hopkins University Press, 1997) The Nazis were glad to steal the refined thought of Nietzsche and make it intoan evil parody wherein the “superman” was a simple product of race, not of thestriving of the human Will. Professor Karl Jaspers chose to “marshal against theNational Socialists the world of thought of the man they had proclaimed as theirown philosopher.” The year after publishing Nietzsche, Jaspers was dischargedfrom his professorship at Heidelberg University by order of the Nazi leadership.This book deals with the full range of Nietzsche’s thought as well as hiswarnings of what the twentieth century was to face. Well-written and inspiring,it will give the aspiring Thelemite strong philosophical roots.
