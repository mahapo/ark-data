Political figures (such as #1, Winston Churchill),literati, and assorted celebrities dominated the list that emerged, to nosurprise.1 Coming in at #73, just behind King Henry V and just ahead ofScotland’s Robert the Bruce, was Aleister Crowley. Best known in his day as the“Wickedest Man in the World” or, as he liked to call himself, “The Great Beast666,” Crowley seems an odd entry for such a list. During his time on Earth, hisinfamy grew far greater than his fame. Nevertheless, in the nearly sixty yearssince his death in relative obscurity, Crowley has become a counterculturalicon. Even if this falls short of the god-like status he yearned for, itdoubtless would gratify him.Aleister Crowley is, few would argue, the father of modern occultism,neopaganism, and New Age spirituality. Today’s Thelemites (avowed followers ofCrowley and his spiritual doctrine of Thelema) far outnumber the small cadre herecruited in his lifetime. His motto “Do What Thou Wilt” has had a subtle andprofound influence on modern culture. While some still fear and loathe him,Aleister Crowley inspires fascination, even admiration, in others.Crowley’s identification with the occult overshadows his achievements in otherspheres. He was a record-setting mountaineer, an outstanding chess player, and atalented or at least popular poet and writer. He also collected an amazinglywide array of friendships and acquaintances, albeit mostly brief, and someregretted. Aleister Crowley had connections of but a few degrees to many of theprominent literary, artistic, and political figures of the early twentiethcentury. For example, his erstwhile friend and famed military theorist Col.J.F.C. Fuller was also a guest at Adolf Hitler’s fiftieth birthday celebration.Another friend, the journalist Walter Duranty, became Stalin’s favorite andapologist. Crowley had numerous links to Churchill, among them the writer FrankHarris, a guest at Churchill’s nuptials.A large number of Crowley’s associates shared his interest in the occult, and asubstantial minority were his partners in sex, drug-taking, magical rites, andother activities licit and illicit. Much less appreciated is that many of thesesame individuals also connected Crowley to the intelligence world. Throughouthis adult life, Crowley associated with people who were, had been, or would bespies. When one of this ilk moved out of Crowley’s life, another, as if bymagic, appeared to take his or her place. These relationships and transitionswere more than coincidence. Hidden behind his occultism and real or feigneddepravity was Crowley’s sporadic work as a secret agent for Her/His Majesty’sGovernment. This book illuminates that deliberately obscured and much-disputedaspect of his life.In 1999, I was deep into researching the complicated and perplexing career ofthe “Ace of Spies,” Sidney Reilly. Intriguing synchronicities kept appearingbetween the movements of Reilly and Crowley. Most intriguing was the men’soverlapping presence in World War I in New York City, where Reilly was working,in his own devious way, for Britain’s “secret service.” Crowley later claimed tohave been doing the same, despite the blatant anti-British propaganda he hadbeen writing for pro-German magazines during much of that time. Notsurprisingly, Crowley’s subsequent protestations of loyal secret service toEngland mostly were dismissed as face-saving fantasy.Still, the question seemed interesting enough to merit a look at whateverAmerican security agencies’ records might hold on the subject. Eventually thefiles of the U.S. Army’s old Military Intelligence Division yielded a thindossier on Crowley’s WWI activities. This handful of documents contained onecritical piece of information: during the war, American investigators, whileprobing the activities of suspected German spies, discovered that “AleisterCrowley was an employee of the British Government . . . in this country onofficial business of which the British Consul, New York City has fullcognizance.”2 Thus Crowley’s claim to have been His Majesty’s servant was trueafter all, at least to some degree. Of course, this leads to the harderquestions: what he did and with whom, and why. My preliminary exploration ofthose and related issues, “Secret Agent 666: Aleister Crowley and BritishIntelligence in America, 1914- 1918,” appeared in the International Journal ofIntelligence and Counter-Intelligence in fall 2000.3 Still immersed in theReilly book and with other research projects in the pipeline, I did not intendto dig any deeper into Crowley’s intrigues.Over the next few years, however, the article achieved a peculiar life of itsown. Crowley fans, Crowley-haters, and others simply intrigued spread it acrossthe Internet. Before long, I was receiving messages offering comments,information, and above all encouragement to look further into Crowley’sinvolvement in espionage. Reluctantly at first, but with mounting enthusiasm aspieces of the puzzle came together, I went to work. The result is this book.One of the first things to become apparent was that Crowley’s secret activitiesduring WWI were part of an involvement in clandestine affairs dating back to hisstudent days at Cambridge University and continuing into the Second World War.The central problem, and my main reservation about the topic, was the dearth ofdocumented, i.e. hard, evidence. The answers to most of the key questionspresumably would be in the archives of the British intelligence and securityservices, MI6 and MI5. Unfortunately, those records were subject to a blanketexclusion from public access, an exemption that remains in effect even under themore recent freedom-of-information statute in the U.K.4I knew from personal experience, however, that the same agencies made the rareexception to this rule when it suited their purposes to do so. As one of ahandful of persons to receive access (dubbed a “briefing”) to Sidney Reilly’sMI6 dossier, I hoped that an appeal to the same authorities might result in likeaccess to Crowley’s. After due consideration, MI6 politely but firmly declinedmy request.5 Per standard procedure, they even avoided admitting outright thatany such file existed. They were thoughtful enough, however, to provide aninteresting list of press references to Crowley that must have come from justsuch a file.I had greater hope of success with MI5, the British internal security agency.Over the past several years “5” has declassified and released to the publicnumerous files on persons and events of “historical significance,” particularlythose connected to espionage. Someone as notorious as Aleister Crowley, a man ofnumerous and dubious associations and publicly accused of treason, degeneracy,satanism, and worse, could not have escaped their notice. MI5’s initial reply inearly 2003 was therefore a surprise. “I am afraid we are unable to help you inyour quest for material on Crowley,” it read, “as, contrary to your assumption,it would appear we never had a file on him.”6 The letter went on to explain thatthis was not necessarily as strange as it might seem, because “despite hisbizarre antics the view may well have been taken that that Crowley did notrepresent a threat to security.” Was this an indirect admission that Crowley hadcollaborated with MI5, or at least that the agency had some assurance that his“antics” presented no threat?Not long after I received that letter, a 1930s MI5 document emerged from thePublic Record Office (the main component of the British National Archives) thatbore a cross-listing reference to another agency file, PP 2573, CROWLEY. Furtherevidence showed this was, indeed, Aleister Crowley. So I wrote again to MI5.After considerable delay, the ever-polite response began with an apology for“having misled you . . . when we said we thought we never held a record forAleister Crowley.”7 In fact, the writer continued, my most recent letter “hashelped us establish that we did indeed hold a record for him under that PPreference. . . . Sadly, it was destroyed (we think) in the 1950s when largenumbers of records which seemed at that point to have outlived their usefulnesswere destroyed.” Furthermore, there was no indication, the letter concluded, asto “why or when Crowley attracted our attention.”I was confused and dissatisfied to say the least. First MI5 asserted that therehad never been a file; then, confronted with evidence of it, they admitted itsexistence and theorized that it had been destroyed. The matter took a furthertwist with the discovery of another document, a page from a 1916 British “BlackList,” which cited two Crowley MI5 files, and evidently much earlier ones. Andso I wrote a third letter. One of the indicated files, PF (“Personal File”)2573, appeared to be an earlier version of the file noted above, but with adifferent prefix. That turned out to be so, but MI5 could offer no informationabout the change in prefix or even what “PP” meant. The eventual answer isintriguing, as we will see. The second file, PF 1943, somehow was overlooked notonce but twice by MI5’s archivists. Their only theory about it was that it hadbeen “destroyed some years ago also.”8Was all this vacillation the result of untidy files, or part of a calculatedsecretiveness? Why would Crowley’s files have been destroyed, when olderdossiers on persons of no more “historical significance” were preserved? Areasonable person could suspect that the explanations were not altogethercomplete or forthright.Of course, even if MI5 and MI6 had revealed the contents of their Crowley files,questions would have remained, and for every question answered, at least oneother would be raised. Moreover, such files end up in the researcher’s handsonly after thorough “weeding.” This can leave a meager or misleading residue ofthe unredacted version. Furthermore, as items may be excised from a dossier, sotoo may they be added.Other archival materials in Britain still offered hope of information onCrowley. An appeal to the records of the Home Office, including the WWII Officeof Home Security, produced a flat denial of having any files on Crowley. A likequery to the Metropolitan Police (i.e. Scotland Yard) produced no responsewhatsoever beyond an automated acknowledgment of the request. As we will see, atleast one person claims to have seen a Crowley MI5 file during WWII, and theBeast himself acknowledged that Scotland Yard kept an extensive record of hisantics.A search of the voluminous files of the British Foreign Office, however, hadmore promising results, or so it initially seemed. The Index to Foreign OfficeCorrespondence, 1906-1919 yielded three file references, including two, FO371/2541 and 371/4264, that related to Crowley’s 1914-1919 activities. But itwas the same old story. Many of these older files have not survived past purges,and all three were among the missing. An imaginative person might suspect aconcerted effort to erase Aleister Crowley from the official record.Such difficulties were not exclusively on the British end. Inquiries as recentas 2006 to the FBI under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act elicited the replythat the Bureau held “no records” relevant to Aleister, a.k.a. Edward Alexander,Crowley.9 This reply somehow overlooked a small file on the Beast that theBureau had released in response to another FOIA request in 1982.10 Moreover, asecond Crowley file surfaced amid the WWI-era records of the FBI’s predecessor,the Bureau of Investigation.I recount all this to sketch what I looked for, what I found, and the pitfallsand frustrations I encountered. The historian’s saving grace in cases of suchbureaucratic secrecy is the weeders’ inability, no matter how hard they work, toexpunge everything. As documents travel from one agency to another and arecross-referenced to other files, things fall between the gaps. From such gapshad the Crowley MI5 references appeared.The practical result of this lack of documentary record is that I must rely moreon circumstantial evidence and informed speculation than I would prefer. Thatalmost led me to abandon the project, before I pieced together everything I had.That synoptic view, a reminder that the weight of circumstantial evidence can becompelling, and has sent more than one man to Death Row, encouraged me to go on.Traces of the Beast’s intelligence-related activities roughly divide into threeevidentiary tiers. First are those persons and things with known connections toCrowley. Second come those that are probable in light of all the evidence.Finally there are mere possibilities generated by circumstances andrelationships. Throughout the book, I will do my best to make these categoriesclear and distinct. The main focus of the book is on 1914-1919, both becauseCrowley’s clandestine activities are better documented for that period, andbecause it was his most intense and prolonged involvement in espionage.Nevertheless this book will also demonstrate Crowley’s long, if episodic,relationship with British and other intelligence bodies, involving manywell-known historical events and persons.One thing I want to make clear up front is that I neither follow Crowley’sesoteric teachings nor have an ax to grind for or against him or them. Moreover,this book is not intended as a general biography of Crowley nor in any way atreatise on his writings or thought, and it takes no position on the reality ofmagic and the supernatural. However, I recognize that Crowley and many othersdid and do place great faith in such things. This book examines many ofCrowley’s better-known actions and associations in a new a light, taking some ofthem as indications of secret intelligence work. While such interpretations mayseem to cast doubt on his mystical motives, this need not be so; the samemagical retreat may be both essential to the health of the spirit and useful asa cover for spying.Numerous Crowley biographies are available, offering a range of interpretationsof the Magician. I found the recent works of Martin Booth, Richard Kaczynski,and Lawrence Sutin particularly useful, which is not to slight any others.11Even so, I have tried to avoid being too influenced or guided by any one workand always endeavored to stick to my own leads and intuitions. Inevitably, Ideveloped my own opinion on Crowley, and it is fair to state that as best I can.Views of the man pretty much fall into three broad categories. Some see theself-proclaimed Great Beast 666 as little better than the Devil incarnate, adepraved, evil, and insidious spiritual influence on his generation and thosesince. While this view has declined in recent decades, Craig Heimbichner’s Bloodon the Altar, which portrays Crowley as the propagator of “the world’s mostdangerous secret society,” demonstrates its enduring appeal.12 Next are suchworks as Daniel P. Mannix’s obscure and sensationalist The Beast and RogerHutchinson’s more recent and mainstream The Beast Demystified.13 These also takea dim view of Crowley, but as a sadistic, oversexed, egotistical monster whosemystical wisdom and “magickal” powers were so much delusion and fakery. Anytalents he had, in this view, were insignificant beside his perverted andselfish behavior. The last view, arguably the most common, is that Crowley,despite many glaring flaws, was a man of genuine courage and brilliance, evengenius. In many respects he was ahead of his time and misunderstood, andsuffered accordingly. Generally, I agree with this last estimation. If not themonster some have described, Crowley certainly was capable of immense emotionaland physical cruelty. Real flashes of insight illuminate his writings, but if hedeveloped anything to an art, it was selfishness. Aleister Crowley would indeedhave been fascinating to meet, but, as others have noted, I would be reluctantto leave my children or my money in his hands.It might seem that someone so obsessively self-centered and disdainful of commondecency as Aleister Crowley would make a poor spy. On the contrary, those veryqualities helped to qualify him for the job. A strong, even ruthless, ego isessential for motivation and self-preservation; the only person the spyultimately can rely on is himself. Espionage, street-level spying anyway, is atbest morally suspect. One British intelligence veteran, Bickham Sweet-Escott,recalled being told at his recruitment, “All I can say is that if you join us,you mustn’t be afraid of forgery, and you mustn’t be afraid of murder.”14 A1950s contract agent for the CIA, George Hunter White, revealed this mindsetwith brutal candor when he recollected, “I toiled wholeheartedly in the vineyardbecause it was fun, fun, fun. Where else could a red-blooded American boy lie,cheat, steal, rape and pillage with the sanction and blessing of theall-highest?”15 Crowley, the proponent of “Do What Thou Wilt,” would have foundsuch an environment both convivial and rewarding on many levels.Still, what would move a man with such evident contempt for the existing orderto serve, indeed risk his life for, King and Country? In his Confessions,referring to 1914, Crowley explained his brand of patriotism:> I still think the English pot as black as the German kettle, and I am still> willing to die in defense of that pot. Mine is the loyalty of Bill Sykes’ dog> . . . the fact that he starves me and beats me doesn’t alter the fact that I> am his dog, and I love him.16More simply put, perhaps, “my country, right or wrong.”Crowley was a pariah and spiritual rebel, but he also longed for the “regularlife of an English Gentleman.”17 His role as a secret agent appealed not only tohis ruthless, amoral side, but also to a profound sense of Englishness and anidiosyncratic but genuine sense of honor and duty.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1www.bbc.co.uk.pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2002/08-August/21/100_britons.shtml[http://www.bbc.co.uk.pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2002/08-August/21/100_britons.shtml].2 U.S. National Archives [USNA], Record Group 165, Military IntelligenceDivision [hereafter MID] file 10012-112, “General Summary”, IntelligenceOfficer, West Point, New York, 23 Sept. 19183 International Journal of Intelligence and CounterIntelligence, Vol. 13, #3(Fall 2000), 359-371.4 This Act went into effect in January 2005.5 J.

Six days out of NewYork, the big liner was bound for her home port, Liverpool. So far it had been aroutine voyage for the more than 1,200 passengers and 650 crew. Britain was atwar, however, and the Lusitania was sailing through a declared war zone. Shortlybefore 1:30 p.m. the Lusitania was spotted by the German submarine U-20, and itscommander, Kapitan-Leutnant Walther Schwieger, with two torpedoes left in hisracks, moved in for the kill.Almost three months earlier, the German Admiralty had proclaimed a policy of“unrestricted” submarine warfare in the waters around Britain. Under thiscontroversial edict, any vessel carrying goods to Germany’s enemies was subjectto attack without warning. Berlin believed that the Lusitania was bearing aheavy cargo of war material, and probably also armament. At approximately 2:10p.m., Schwieger fired a single torpedo that struck the liner just behind thebridge. A second, larger explosion soon followed. Almost at once, the big shiptook on a list, and to Schwieger’s surprise, and to that of many on board, shestarted to sink rapidly by the bow. In a mere eighteen minutes she was gone,taking with her almost 1,200 souls. Among the dead were 128 Americans.At first glance, the Lusitania’s fate seems like simple bad luck; she was in thewrong place at the wrong time and took the torpedo in the wrong spot. From theimmediate wake of the ship’s sinking right up to the present day, however,recriminations, controversy, and conspiracy theories have swirled around thetragedy. Perhaps the most startling of these theories, to be examined in moredetail later, is that the British Admiralty instigated the destruction of the“Lucy” with the aim of outraging Americans and bringing the U.S. into the war.The charge is not as outlandish as it may first sound. Whether or not theLusitania was specifically targeted as the sacrificial victim, elements in theAdmiralty’s intelligence section were endeavoring to provoke the Germans intoinflammatory actions, and they had placed agents into the enemy camp for justthat purpose. One such operative, who had successfully insinuated himself intothe confidence of German agents and diplomats in the United States, was AleisterCrowley. He later claimed not only to have helped convince his German friendsthat the Lusitania was a man-of-war, but also to have encouraged them to disdainand provoke the Americans. When in 1917 the U.S. finally severed diplomaticrelations with Berlin, the first step toward war, Crowley gave himself somecredit for helping to bring that about.Why would the Admiralty, or any other responsible agency of British officialdom,enlist for such sensitive duties a man publicly reviled as a reprobate,degenerate, and satanist? Why would a man with such apparent contempt for decentsociety and basic morality volunteer to serve his country in any capacity? Whywould the Germans take this dubious Englishman into their confidence and evenput him to work as a propagandist? Finally, how did Crowley subsequently avoidlegal repercussions in Britain for this apparent treason? The answers to thesequestions and many others lie ahead."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE [../Text/contents.html] 006 [../Images/00002.jpg] GOD, COUNTRY, KING, & LODGE007 [../Images/00002.jpg] EDWARD ALEXANDER CROWLEY, SORCERER, PROPHET, SPY, AND “WICKEDEST MAN IN THEWORLD,” first revealed himself on 12 October 1875 in Royal Leamington Spa, apleasant mid-England town near Stratford-on-Avon. The new arrival, dubbed“Alick,” was the first born and only surviving offspring of Edward and EmilyCrowley. Though commoners, the Crowleys were well-off, in most respects solidmembers of the Victorian middle class. Edward Crowley originally owed hisprosperity to a share in the family brewing and eatery enterprise, but he haddiversified, investing shrewdly in water works and land reclamation.Edward Crowley’s secure finances permitted him to pursue his heart’s truecalling, preaching the gospel. Religion differentiated him and his family frommost of their neighbors and relations. Most of the Crowley kin were Quakers,already nonconformists, but he and Emily adhered to a small, recently formedevangelical sect, the Plymouth Brethren. The Quakers thought the Brethren a bitfanatical. The apocalypse-minded Plymouth Brethren anticipated the imminent endof the world with smug satisfaction, if not outright glee. They rejected theofficial Church and most other forms of Christianity as misguided andhell-bound. The Exclusive Brethren, the sub-sect to which the Crowleys belonged,eschewed communion and most other contact with persons outside their narrowcommunity. By today’s standards, the sect bore certain characteristics of a“cult.”As noted in the Introduction, this book is not a comprehensive biography of theGreat Beast, but some consideration of his family and formative years is inorder. After his death a story circulated among the Crowley clan that attributedhis beastly behavior to a bad streak inherited from his grandmother, MarySparrow.1 Overall, Alick appears to have had a happy childhood within the narrowworld of his parents and, save for chronic asthma, a healthy one. When he waseleven, however, his father died, leaving the boy to the mercies of his motherand her brother, Thomas Bishop, an official in HM Customs and a pious bully whobore no affection for his nephew (and vice versa). Whether the diminutive EmilyCrowley was truly the “brainless bigot” that her son and others have portrayedis open to question; perhaps she simply was overwhelmed by her precocious andrebellious son.2 It was she who, in a fit of frustration, first branded him the“Beast of the Apocalypse,” and it says something about their relationship thathe embraced that identity as his alter ego for the rest of his life. Certainlyhis maternal relationship had something to do with his tempestuous dealings withthe opposite sex. Whether Crowley drove women crazy or simply was drawn to thosealready halfway there, his love life never ran smoothly.Alick seemingly inherited none of his father’s financial acumen. Althoughblessed with an inheritance that would have, with prudent management, supportedhim for the rest of his life, his basic approach to money was to spend until itwas gone and then pray for more to drop into his lap. Oddly, this approachusually worked, although it kept him swinging from one extreme to the other andfrequently fretting over impending destitution. As we will see, however, thefuture Mega Therion was never without means to keep himself fed, housed, andclothed, usually quite comfortably, and seldom was so stretched that he couldnot afford such indulgences (necessities, he might argue) as drugs and whores.He would credit this to the benevolence of the gods, but we must wonder whethersometimes it was another, more mundane, agency at work.In one respect the Beast did follow in his father’s footsteps. Edward Crowleysought to save the souls of poor sinners by converting them to his faith. Hisson, broadly speaking, spent most of his life trying to do the same. Just a stepfrom the Plymouth Brethren’s rejection of mainstream Christianity are Crowley’srepudiation of Christianity altogether and his advocacy of a new religiousorder, Thelema.Crowley had a deeply conflicted personality, with both manifest and shadowaspects. His repudiation of conventional morality and a somewhat sadisticcompulsion to shock and humiliate mirrored an obscure longing for “the regularlife of an English Gentleman.” If he held the Established Order in contempt, healso secretly craved its admiration and acceptance. His observation about havingan anarchistic mind and aristocratic heart speaks to a certain talent forduplicity. Perhaps his great unrealized career was not messiah, poet, ormountaineer, but actor. These aptitudes would serve him well as a secret agent.In an interview with the BBC, espionage author John Le Carré talked about whypeople become and remain spies and the subtle rewards it offers. Le Carré (DavidCornwell) had a long career in British intelligence, something long assumed bymany of his readers but only recently acknowledged by the author. He likened hisrecruitment while a student at Oxford University to a religious awakening: “Ireally believed at last that I had found a cause I could serve. . . . It was ifthe whole of my life had prepared me for that moment,” he continued, “It waslike joining the priesthood.”3 It is easy to imagine Crowley saying much thesame. Le Carré also added to the equation an inner, somewhat perverse,satisfaction in deception and “the dignity which great secrecy confers uponyou.” He noted the requirement of “flexible morality” or “a necessary sacrificeof morality” which, if disturbing, also had a “voluptuous quality” of nearsexual gratification. Put another way, espionage work permitted, often demanded,that one do things normally considered wicked and not only get away with them,but be rewarded for them. Defying moral conventions while simultaneously servingsome patriotic greater good would have been irresistible to the Beast.The pursuit of the occult has more than a little in common with espionage. Inhis later novel Moonchild, Crowley’s character “Lord Anthony Bowling” opinesthat “investigation of spiritualism makes a capital training-ground for secretservice work, one soon gets up to all the tricks.”4 That Bowling was a thinlydisguised portrait of Everard Feilding, one of the Beast’s longest and mostimportant contacts in British intelligence, illuminates this remark. Crowleyoffered that the goal of magic was to effect changes in the physical world “inaccordance with will,” i.e. to manipulate behavior and natural forces withoutobservable action. Toward the end of his life, he further reflected on that whenhe compared the Secret Chiefs, the supposedly invisible and inaccessible mastersof the “Great White Lodge,” to “Captain A. and Admiral B. of the NavalIntelligence Service.”5 Both carefully concealed themselves and their actionsfrom public scrutiny to the point that their very existence could be questioned.They worked in mysterious ways to achieve their ends, often without the fullcognizance or understanding of those who served them.There is an incident in Crowley’s early years that says something about hispeculiar relationship with England and his sense of duty. During his time atMalvern College (a boarding school) in 1891-1892, he joined the Cadet Corps ofthe 1st Worcestershire Royal Artillery Volunteers. This required him to take anoath of loyalty to the Crown. In a section later removed from hisautobiographical Confessions, the Beast noted that whatever his personal issueswith British government and Society, and those were many, he always felt himselfbound by that oath. He added that “every time I perform an act in support of myoriginal oath, I strengthen the link [to England].”6 Therein may be the key tohis future secret service.While Crowley’s adolescence was typically rocky, he did note some bright spots.One was an older Scottish cousin, Gregor Grant. Crowley credits Grant withexposing him to the works of Robert Burns and Walter Scott and turning him intoa “romantic Jacobite”—that is a partisan of the Stuart Dynasty that had lost thethrones of England and Scotland almost two centuries before.7 As we will see,their reaccession remained a viable cause for some. The Celtic influence movedAlick to adopt the moniker “Aleister” in place of his given name, though henever effected a legal change. (Grant also encouraged Crowley’s interest inclimbing. In July 1894, for instance, they ascended the Devil’s Chimney, a smallbut treacherous chalk pinnacle near Beachy Head.8)Another positive early influence was Aunt Annie, the second wife of his uncle,Jonathan Crowley. In some ways she was his mother-substitute.9 Annie waswell-educated and active in the Primrose League. Named for Disraeli’s favoriteflower, the League was a auxiliary of the then dominant Conservative Party,which Lord Randolph Churchill, father of Winston, helped found.The Primrose League may have facilitated Crowley’s introduction to clandestinework. Modeled on the Orange Order, the secretive fraternal hard core of IrishProtestantism, the Primrose League broke ground by admitting women (like AuntAnnie), and acted like the popular front of “Tory Democracy.” It alsoconstituted a kind of secret society within the Conservative Party, an earlyform of political action committee that, e.g., spied on perceived enemies ofToryism. Despite his associations with the extremes of Left and Right, Crowleymaintained that he always was a Tory at heart, and that may have been as true astatement about his political persuasion as he ever made. The Primrose Leaguecould have used a young man of such versatility and conviction-e.g., by usingyoung Crowley’s interest in Celtic revivalism and dissident Jacobitism tomonitor their adherents.Through Aunt Annie’s efforts, Crowley claimed, he gained the patronage of twoPrimrose League luminaries, Charles Thomson Ritchie (later 1st Baron Ritchie)and Robert Gascoyne Cecil, the Marquess of Salisbury. Cecil was not only GrandMaster of the League, but also reigned as prime minister for most of 1885-1902.Ritchie was Salisbury’s loyal cabinet member and a former Secretary of theAdmiralty. In 1895, Ritchie became the new member of Parliament for Croydon,home to Annie and Jonathan Crowley and Crowley Ale’s main brewery. As awell-heeled and active supporter of Ritchie’s campaign, Annie Crowley couldcommand his attention and, through him, solicit the help of Salisbury, who wasalways looking for young “men of ability.”10 This supports Aleister’s claim thathe entered Cambridge in the autumn of 1895 with the help of Lord Salisbury andearmarked by him for a career in the Diplomatic Service.By the time he entered Cambridge’s Trinity College, the former Alick had growninto a tall, strong young man, although still plagued by asthma. For the nextthree years he was, he said, a sporadically brilliant but generally unmotivatedstudent. A better description might be “unchallenged.” He delved into math andchemistry and read voraciously; he was searching for something unknown withinthe confines of Trinity. Chess provided one outlet, poetry another. His abidingpassion, though, was mountaineering, which drew him from Britain’s high placesto the forbidding Swiss Alps. Climbing strengthened his lungs, but moreimportantly it assuaged an appetite for physical danger and a desire to test andstretch his limits. So, of course, would spying.Crowley at Cambridge kept his distance from most of his fellow students, just ashe preferred solo climbing. He did, however, develop a mighty interest in sex,in many of its varieties. In addition to indulging in the favors of the willing“younger women” of the vicinity, he allegedly had a liaison with Herbert C. J.“Jerome” Pollitt, an older man who provided Crowley with an introduction to theBohemian demi-monde where he sometimes entertained as a female impersonator.11While Crowley later confessed an intense friendship with Pollitt, he denied any“physical passion.”12 Be that as it may, Crowley preferred women, thoughbisexuality, innate or cultivated, became part of his persona. Perhaps this wasanother manifestation of his chameleon-like ability to assume attitudes androles. Among the presumably platonic friends he made at Cambridge was a buddingpainter, Gerald Festus Kelly, later a noted portraitist and president of theRoyal Academy of Art. Five years after meeting at school, Crowley and Kellybecame brothers-in-law; later on both became wartime operatives in His Majesty’sSecret Service.It seems likely that Crowley, like Le Carré and many before him, had his firstbrush with the intelligence work while still in school. During the summer“long-vacation” of 1897, he broke with his habit of scaling to Alps to visit St.Petersburg, Russia. His purpose, ostensibly, was to improve his Russian, for henot only had determined on a career in the Diplomatic Service but was aiming atan appointment to “the most interesting and brilliant court in Europe”—that ofTsar Nicholas II.13 He added that “the subtlety of intrigue has alwaysfascinated me.”14 Intrigue, of course, is not the stock in trade of a diplomat,but the remark makes sense if Crowley was consciously or unconsciouslyindicating the true purpose of his Russian sojourn.Russia at this time was a minefield for any representative of the British Crown.The Empire of the Tsar was Britain’s most dangerous international rival andpotential enemy. Each empire engaged in vigorous espionage against the other.Most of this activity was handled through embassies and consulates; just aboutany British diplomat in Russia could expect to do some sort of spying and to bespied upon. Of course, a young, affluent and cultivated Briton traveling on hisown to sight-see and refine his Russian would seem an innocent commonplace.Therefore, he could be a useful observer of local conditions and sentiments and,if reliable, a courier of information. Crowley’s St. Petersburg foray fits thepattern of a test-run for a prospective agent. (Amado Crowley’s claim that theBeast used this 1897 sojourn to meet with the later-to-be-notorious GrigoriRasputin is pure fantasy.15 Rasputin was then busy siring children in far-offSiberia.)We need to pause and consider a few basic facts about espionage and brieflyexamine the organization of British intelligence at the close of the nineteenthcentury. First we must distinguish between an intelligence “officer” and an“agent.” The terms often are used indiscriminately, and Crowley has beendescribed as both, but there is a crucial difference. An officer of anintelligence service is a formal, often career, employee of thegovernment—someone who merits a salary and maybe a pension. He may have anofficer’s commission in a military service or an intelligence service rank ofequivalent stature. The functions of an intelligence officer are most oftenmanagerial; he might engage in hands-on spying, but generally the job consistsof recruiting and managing agents to do the dirty work. A case-officer directsor “runs” one or more agents, who may also be referred to as assets.Agents, therefore, are compensated discreetly, and are seldom regular employeesof the service. The identity of agents is often a closely guarded secret, evendecades after their service and death. Agents can be divided into sub-varietiesranging from simple informants to deep-cover operatives used to penetrateopposing organizations. A sub-variety is the agent provocateur, who works fromthe inside to compromise or disrupt the target organization. Aleister Crowleyalways was an agent, never an officer, and his most important roles, as we willsee, were infiltrator and agent provocateur.Perhaps the most important thing to understand about Crowley’s relationship withBritish Intelligence is that the latter was a house of many rooms, undergoingcontinual remodeling. The origins of the British secret service go back at leastas far as the reign of Elizabeth I, when the redoubtable Sir Francis Walsinghamorganized a network of agents to aid Queen Bess in her struggles against enemiesforeign and domestic. Two of those agents were the scholar and magus Dr. JohnDee and his equally occult-versed assistant, the disreputable Edward Kelley.Dee’s secret signature is said to have inspired Ian Fleming to adopt “007” asthe codename for his fictional secret agent, James Bond.16 Crowley fanciedhimself the reincarnation of Kelley, a conceit that may have helped draw himinto clandestine labors.The British secret establishment as we know it today, dominated by the agenciesMI5 and MI6, did not exist in the late nineteenth century. During the 1870s and’80s, first the War Office (WO), followed by the Admiralty, set up IntelligenceDivisions mostly for the purposes of gathering foreign military information.These agencies served, among other masters, the Foreign Office (FO), whichcontrolled a modest “Secret Service budget” for clandestine operations. Mostintelligence-gathering was run out of embassies and consulates, with attachésand other diplomats handling the recruitment of agents and processing the rawinformation. Beyond this, the Indian Civil Service ran its own spy andcounter-subversion network, and the Colonial Office dabbled inintelligence-gathering, as did the Board of Trade through its CommercialIntelligence Division.At the close of the nineteenth century, Britain’s domestic security lay in thehands of trusty Scotland Yard, above all its Special Branch (SB). The dominantfigure of that body was Irish-born William Melville, a.k.a. “M” (the originalone), a man who served as Conan Doyle’s model for Sherlock Holmes’s friendlyrival, Inspector LeStrade.17 Melville was not squeamish about his methods orchoice of agents. He recruited, and even seems to have preferred, dubious andunsavory characters. One such recruit in the mid-’90s was a young Russian Jewwith a revolutionary and criminal background, known as Sigmund Rosenblum. A fewyears later, with Melville’s help, he restyled himself as Sidney George Reilly,British intelligence’s so-called “Ace-of-Spies.”18 Melville was the nemesis ofall “subversive elements,” whether they be Irish Republicans (Fenians),anarchists, or foreign spies.Melville provides another example of the blending of public and privateintelligence gathering, to be encountered often in the coming chapters. Inautumn 1903, the fifty-three-year-old Inspector retired from Scotland Yard, butbarely a month later he was running the office of “W. Morgan, General Agent,” aprivate detective agency. In reality, the outfit was a front for a War Officeorgan monitoring “all cases of suspicious Germans (and) Frenchmen and foreignersgenerally.”19 It was the precursor of MI5.By the time Crowley left Cambridge in summer 1898, he had steered far away froma diplomatic career, the orderly life of an English gentleman, and most otherconventional paths. He had become a seeker of spiritual enlightenment, and tothat end a student of occult wisdom and practices. A critical early experienceoccurred at the end of 1896, a spiritual crisis or mysterious “calling” heexperienced while visiting Stockholm. What he was doing in the Swedish capitalis a mystery. British records show that Crowley received a passport on 28December 1896, just in time for the boat to Stockholm. Curiously, Britishsubjects did not require a passport to visit Sweden or much anywhere else. Oneplace that did require the document was Russia, and Stockholm was a main transitpoint to Russian-ruled Finland and thence to St. Petersburg. Could Crowley’s“crisis” have been a tyro spy’s jitters over a pending mission?What really seems to have started him down the twisting trail of occultism wasthe Book of Black Magic and of Pacts by a self-proclaimed expert, Arthur EdwardWaite. So taken was Crowley by this work, with its suggestions of mysticbrotherhoods and ancient traditions, that he wrote to Waite seeking furtherguidance. Waite responded by suggesting that he take a look at The Cloud on theSanctuary, an obscure tome by an equally obscure eighteenth-century Germanmystic, Karl von Eckartshausen.20 Eckartshausen had studied at the JesuitUniversity of Ingolstadt under Adam Weisshaupt (or Weishaupt), later theinfamous founder of one of the most notorious secret societies, the BavarianIlluminati. What, if anything, Crowley made of that connection is uncertain, buthe did latch onto Eckarthausen’s allegorical work as further evidence of aSecret Church and a “hidden community of Saints” guided by mysterious,illuminated adepts.The young Beast plunged into, or deeper into, a study of alchemy, tarot, magic,demonology, and like arcana. Knowingly or not, he had found his true calling. AsCrowley later told the tale, his lucky break came during a late summer climbingexpedition to Switzerland. One evening in a lodge near Zermatt, he waspontificating to some fellow guests about alchemy, unaware that within earshotsat Julian Baker, an accomplished chemist and practicing alchemist, and muchbetter versed in the latter than Crowley. He later took Crowley aside toinstruct him, and over the next few days the eager Cambridge graduate becameBaker’s constant companion, pressing him for more information. Baker revealedhimself as a member of an exclusive mystical society, the Hermetic Order of theGolden Dawn, and promised to introduce Crowley to other members when theyreturned to London.Besides luck or divine providence, there is another way to read the aboveencounter. Arguably, Crowley knew who Baker was and that he was near. The Beastinitiated talk of alchemy to get Baker’s attention. Crowley’s aim, it seemsreasonable to suppose, was to win Baker’s confidence and, through him, anintroduction, and ultimately admittance to, the Golden Dawn.Back in London, Baker introduced him to Frater Nolo Noscere (a.k.a. George CecilJones), who introduced Crowley to the Order’s leading figures, including WilliamWynn Westcott, Florence Farr, and William Butler Yeats. It turned out that Waitehimself was a member of the Golden Dawn. Perhaps Crowley knew that all along,too. It would take a little longer for Crowley to meet the patriarch of theOrder, Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers.The Golden Dawn was, in theory, highly selective in its membership . Beyondgetting a recommendation from a current member or trusted associate, thecandidate had to undergo a background check and an interview by members of theInner Circle as well as an “‘astral’ or ‘psychic’ interview.”21 Somehow, Crowleypassed all these tests, and on 18 November 1898 he joined the Golden Dawn’sIsis-Urania Lodge.The theory here is that Crowley sought this initiation not only out ofcuriosity, but also as part of an intelligence assignment, most likely fromWilliam Melville. But why would Melville or any British official have beeninterested in this small group of harmless, indeed respectable, eccentrics?Again one must look at the Golden Dawn and Crowley’s occultism in the context oflate Victorian society. The latter was part of what historian James Webb hasdubbed “The Age of the Irrational.” In late nineteenth-century Britain, afascination with the occult was commonplace, especially among the educatedclasses. Secret societies abounded, and by far the largest and most influentialof these was Freemasonry. Freemasons therefore figure in a variety of conspiracytheories, which portray them as everything from a corrupt fraternity toseditionists and Satanists.22 To be fair, most mainstream Masons then and nowreject any association with occultism and even reject the label “secretsociety,” preferring “society with secrets.”While Freemasonry had become a worldwide organization by the 1890s, with variousbranches and jurisdictions, the United Grand Lodge of England and Wales (UGLE)remained the largest regular body, and Britain the most Masonic of countries. By1900, the UGLE boasted almost 3,000 lodges with nearly 200,000 brethren.23 Thatwas still a tiny minority out of a general population of some 33 million, butMasonic affiliation had become a virtual union card for admission to the Britishestablishment. Thus, the proportion of Masons in governmental service (includingintelligence agencies) was much, much higher than in the population generally.By becoming so mainstream, however, regular Freemasonry lost much of its air ofexclusivity and mystery. Those seeking a more exclusive mystical experiencegravitated to such “appendant” or “para-Masonic” bodies as the Scottish, Yorke,or more esoteric Egyptian and Martinist Rites, with their bevy of higher degreesand arcane orders. No doubt many doctrinaire Brethren would be relieved to knowthat Crowley was never a member of any UGLE-recognized lodge. Nevertheless heaccumulated an impressive array of “irregular” initiations and degrees.Masonry also provided the main recruiting ground for avowedly occult groups,among them the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia, founded in 1865. Rosicrucianismhad its roots in mystical works, probably spurious, that cropped up in the earlyseventeenth century. The nineteenth-century version was mostly an amalgam ofritual magic, alchemy, and Jewish Kabbalah (a magical system based onnumerology). The same elements would constitute the core of Crowley’s brand ofmagic.Another pervasive influence in British occultism was Theosophy, Russian-bornHelena Blavatsky’s concoction of Hindu, Buddhist, and Western mysteries. Foundedin 1875, the Theosophical Society was particularly important in promulgating(though it did not originate) the notion of a secret body of Ascended Masters or“Mahatmas” somewhere in the vastness of Central Asia (or the Astral Plane) whoguided the spiritual progress of mankind.24The 1880s also saw the founding of the Society for Psychical Research (SPR),which investigated all aspects of the “paranormal.” Its members included thestatesman Arthur James Balfour (nephew of Lord Salisbury) and Times publisherW.T. Stead.25 Yet another luminary was the aforementioned Everard Feilding,later one of the Beast’s most important contacts in the intelligence world.Formed in 1888, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (HOGD) merged most ofthese currents. Almost all of its founding members were Rosicrucians, and mostof those Freemasons of one sort or another. Like the Primrose League, the GoldenDawn broke with Masonic practice by welcoming women. Among the Golden Dawnfaithful, Theosophy’s Mahatmas were renamed the “Secret Chiefs.” These powerfulbeings worked in mysterious ways, and whether they were human was debatable. Asmentioned, Crowley compared the Secret Chiefs and their mysterious ways to theheads of an intelligence service, noting that both spy chiefs and Secret Chiefs“keep us in the dark for precisely the same reasons.”26 The HOGD claimed to bethe British branch of a much older occult lodge in Germany, though whether thiswas puffery remains a matter of debate.27Still, none of this would make the Golden Dawn a threat to the establishedorder. Unconventional spirituality, however, often intersects withunconventional politics. Within the Order were political currents that wouldhave aroused any watchful guardian of the State. Back at Cambridge Crowley hadbecome enamored with Jacobitism, or (as most of its adherents preferred to callit) “Legitimism.” The English Legitimists, though few, included popular writers,clergymen, and even members of the peerage.28 A prominent example was BertramAshburnham, the fifth Earl of Ashburnham. His large estate in Wales included,among other amenities, its own military training ground. Ashburnham revived themoribund Jacobite cause in 1886 by forming, or re-forming, the Society of theOrder of the White Rose (SOWR), which became the main public face of BritishLegitimism. Closely associated with SOWR were the Thames Valley Legitimist Cluband the more exclusive Legitimist League, “a secret society which takes care toallow as little of its doings as possible to transpire to the public.”29Ashburnham belonged to an array of other secret orders. He was, for instance, aKnight of Malta and Grand Master of the cultish and quasi-Masonic Order of St.Thomas of Acre.There is no evidence that Ashburnham was a member of the Golden Dawn, butpolitics definitely linked him to a fellow ultra-Jacobite, Samuel MacGregorMathers, who claimed spiritual authority over the HOGD as chosen mouthpiece ofthe Secret Chiefs. His authority, however, was increasingly questioned inLondon, in part because he secluded himself in Paris to better pursue hisLegitimist intrigues.30 He dabbled in plots against various governments,including Spain’s, Portugal’s, and probably Britain’s. Crowley first met Mathersin Paris in May 1899.For Ashburnham and Mathers, Jacobitism was a deadly serious business. Regimechange, by armed rebellion if necessary, was their aim. They complained thatQueen Victoria and her Saxe-Coburg-Gotha line were German usurpers, though theircandidate was hardly any less foreign. That dubious honor fell to Maria TheresaHenrietta Dorothea de Austria-Este-Modena, daughter of the Duke of Modena andwife of Ludwig, Regent (later King Ludwig III) of Bavaria. By the late 1890s,however, British Legitimists had begun to shift their hopes to her son, PrinceRupprecht, or Robert as they imagined him on the thrones of England andScotland. Coincidentally or not, Ashburnham, MacGregor Mathers, and friends werebuying arms in Bavaria.31 (Recall the Golden Dawn’s claim to be a branch of aGerman secret society.)Ashburnham and McGregor Mathers favored a radical scheme of devolution for theBritish Isles that would grant wide autonomy to Scotland, Wales, Ireland, andeven Cornwall. This calculated appeal to Celtic separatist sentiments encouragedthe presence of Yeats, (according to Melville, a professional paranoid), MaudeGonne, and other Irish nationalists in the Golden Dawn. The Legitimists were atiny band, but so were the Irish Fenians, and in some ways that made both allthe more elusive and dangerous. Their common opposition to the existing ordermade Jacobite-Fenian collusion likely.The neo-Jacobite crowd also favored the“more extreme forms ofAnglo-Catholicism,” advocating the return of Britain to the Roman fold.32Ashburnham was a Catholic convert, and others of that ilk weredisproportionately represented in the Legitimist movement. Cardinal Rampolla, noless than the Vatican’s secretary of state, conferred “the choicest blessing ofHeaven” on the Thames Valley organization for its staunch support of thePapacy.33 Rampolla will return in a different role in the next chapter.Crowley associated with two other outspoken proponents of Jacobitism and Celticnationalism. The first, Louis C. R. Duncombe-Jewell, a.k.a. Ludovic Cameron, hadalso been born into the Plymouth Brethren but, following Ashburnham’s example,jumped ship for Roman Catholicism. He was a sometime reporter for the Daily Mailwho dreamed of raising a “Celtic Empire” that would embrace Scotland, Ireland,Wales, Cornwall, and Brittany. The Beast described him as a “passionateJacobite” but claimed to find his political schemes “rather childish.”34 Evenso, the two were chummy; Duncombe-Jewell later stayed with Crowley in Scotlandand was a witness at his 1903 wedding. Duncombe-Jewell also was up to his neckin such Legitimist intrigues as “carrying out delicate and not always safemissions” in Germany and elsewhere.35Much the same could be said for Henry Jenner, the so-called “Bard of Cornwall.”Crowley’s connection with him seems to have been indirect, throughDuncombe-Jewell and probably Ashburnham.36 Jenner served as “Chancellor” ofAshburnham’s Order of the White Rose. He also was the Jacobite movement’s chief“cryptographer” and the man handling secrets negotiations in Bavaria andelsewhere.37 Crowley thus insinuated himself into a group of activeinternational conspirators with seditious intentions.Ashburnham and his fellow schemers saw themselves as part of a bigger Legitimistmovement in Europe. They championed the claim of Don Miguel to the throne ofPortugal and in France dreamed of restoring a Bourbon monarchy. The great hopeof Legitimism, however, was another Bourbon, Don Carlos of Spain, the onlyclaimant with a real chance of seizing power. The nineteenth-century uprisingsof his partisans, the Carlists, plunged Spain into three episodes of bloodycivil war. A fresh opportunity for Don Carlos II seemed to arrive in 1899. Theweak government in Madrid was reeling from the recent, humiliating defeat by theUnited States. The northern provinces, the Carlist heartland, seethed withunrest. Carlos’ supporters, domestic and foreign, pressed him to unfurl hisbanner and launch a new insurrection.Ashburnham, MacGregor Mathers, Duncombe-Jewell, and Jenner were all embroiled inthis Spanish adventure. So was Crowley. Ashburnham lent his estate for thetraining of British volunteers. Our man later recounted how in the service ofDon Carlos he “obtained a commission to work a machine-gun, took pains to makemyself a first class rifle shot, and studied drill, tactics and strategy.”38 Thecrucial moment came in summer 1899. In Madrid, the government moved to ratifythe peace treaty with the United States. The disgruntled ex-commander of theSpanish forces in Cuba, General Valeriano Weyler y Nicolau, talked of a coupd’état while secretly negotiating with the Carlists.39 At the same time,Ashburnham loaded his personal yacht, the Firefly, with Gras rifles purchased inGermany and dispatched it to Spain under the command of a White Rose stalwart,Royal Navy Lieutenant Vincent John English.40 On 15 July, however, on the lastleg of its third gun-running trip, the Firefly ran into trouble in the Frenchport of Arcachon. An alerted Spanish consul demanded that French customs seizethe vessel. As Crowley put it, the “conspiracy was disclosed.”41 Listed amongthe crew of the Firefly was a “C. Alexander,” an early example of Crowley’s manyaliases.42 The fiasco ended the uprising, although Carlist rumblings continuedwell into 1902.Thirty years later, the Beast remained oddly reticent about his Spanishescapade, offering only that “there is a great deal more to this story; but Icannot tell it—yet.”43 The likely reason is that revealing his true role wouldreveal the hand of the British “Secret Service.” Among those suspected of thebetrayal is Crowley himself.Ashburnham’s and his cronies’ aid to Don Carlos was not unselfish. Theyexpected, realistically or not, that the newly installed Carlos VII wouldsupport their own ambitions. This may even connect to Crowley’s earlier visit toRussia. In 1896, Don Carlos’ son, the Young Pretender Don Jaime, accepted acommission in the Russian Imperial Army. He was favored by Tsar Nicholas, andthere was reason to suspect that the Russians secretly supported his father’scause. That doubtless gave persons in London additional incentive to nip Carlos’hopes in the bud.When he joined the Golden Dawn, and for a time thereafter, Crowley took on theidentity of a Russian nobleman, Count Vladimir Svareff. The Beast laterunconvincingly explained the impersonation as a half-baked sociologicalexperiment and effort to hide his occult activities from his family. As we willsee, he had that penchant for disguises and false identities that any decent spywould cultivate. He cannot have made a convincing Russian, certainly not to realones, so whom was he trying to deceive? Could the impersonation have been ahalf-baked scheme to smoke out Russian agents in or around the Golden Dawn?This brings us back to the theory that, like his encounter with Baker inSwitzerland, Crowley’s entry into the Golden Dawn, his cultivation of MacGregorMathers, Ashburnham, et al., and his enlistment in the Spanish plot were allpart of a plan to spy on and thwart these men. Everything about his associationwith the HOGD smacks of an agent provocateur. Personality conflicts already rentthe Order, and Crowley’s behavior escalated them. He rose rapidly through thelevels of the Order, too rapidly for some. His arrogance and all-too-avidinterest in sexual matters also made waves.The schism came in late 1899 when members of the senior Second Order, led byFarr and Yeats, refused to grant the upstart admission to the Adeptus Minordegree. An enraged Crowley rushed to Paris and convinced Mathers to initiatehim, thus driving the wedge between Mathers and the London group. Later, Mathersdispatched his young acolyte back to London in a bizarre and brazen attempt totake physical control of the Order. In a black mask and highland garb,brandishing a ceremonial dagger, Crowley stormed about the lodge but failed tocow its denizens. He and Mathers ended up expelled from the Order, whichtriggered its irreversible disintegration.So far as the Order is concerned, the Beast’s probable aim was not to destroythe Golden Dawn, but to undermine the Jacobite Mathers’ authority. In theaftermath, their superficial friendship quickly degenerated into mutual chargesof fraud, blackmail, and attempted murder (by magical means). Crowley’sallegations against Mathers included “Jacobite conspiracies to overthrow thethrone of England.”44 That probably was the truth. Later still, in his novelMoonchild, Crowley thinly disguised Mathers as a German spy and the tool of anevil cabal of magicians called the Black Brotherhood. They were the enemies,naturally, of the benevolent Great White Brotherhood.Crowley’s joining the Golden Dawn with the ulterior motives of spy andprovocateur is entirely consistent with a sincere interest in magic. He had theopportunity to milk the Order for the (possibly meager) knowledge it couldprovide. His determination that the HOGD’s leadership was full of posers,swindlers, and traitors simply made its ruination that much easier.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 Mary Crowley and Ian Glover, “The Crowley Family”,www.manicai.net/genealogy/gam_aleister.html[http://www.manicai.net/genealogy/gam_aleister.html] “Crowley Family,” 17.2 Ibid., 19, and CAC, 36.3 John Le Carré, “I Really Was a Spy,” //archives.cnn.com/2000/books/news/12/26[http:////archives.cnn.com/2000/books/news/12/26] john.lecarre, quoting from BBCdocumentary “The Secret Centre,” 2000.4 Aleister Crowley, Moonchild (London: Mandrake, 1929), 308.

"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO [../Text/contents.html] 008 [../Images/00002.jpg] THE MOVEABLE BEAST009 [../Images/00002.jpg] SOON AFTER THE GOLDEN DAWN MELTDOWN, the Beast retreated to Boleskine, his newlyacquired house near Loch Ness. There he played at being a local laird andperformed “magickal” operations to perfect his command of the occult arts. Everrestless, however, in summer 1900 he left Britain, supposedly for New York, andfor the next several years roamed the world, returning occasionally to hisScottish lair.If he entered Gotham it was off the immigration record, nor does any Americanport or border crossing reveal his presence. He must have used an alias, butwhich and, above all, why, remain a mystery. In any case, Crowley’s truedestination was Mexico, where he surfaced in July. He seems to have spent mostof the next few months mountaineering, but he also took time to befriend DonJesus de Medina, a fellow occultist and a leading figure in Mexican ScottishRite Freemasonry. Don Jesus awarded the visiting Englishman his Rite’s coveted33°, and the pair even formed their own secret society, the “Lamp of InvisibleLight.”1In Mexico, Crowley also caught up with the Anglo-German alpinist OscarEckenstein. Their relationship appears to have been based on a common love ofclimbing, although German businesses were vigorous in Mexico and generallyallied with British ones against the even more aggressive Yanquis. We will givemore consideration to that below.Another acquaintance Crowley either made or renewed in Mexico was with peyote(Anhalonium lewinii). The drug had made its way to Europe before 1900, and aGerman chemist had synthesized its main psychoactive component, mescaline, in1898, so the Beast may have taken it before. Still, he was now in its nativehabitat and would not have missed such an opportunity. The peyote experienceremained of interest to Crowley for years, for magical and other applications.While in Mexico, Crowley also experimented with “making [him]self invisible,” alifelong obsession. His rituals to attain this goal had only limited success—amerely “flickering” state.2 Not long after, however, when forced to protecthimself against robbers and an angry mob, he stumbled upon the key, or so hebelieved. The Beast attributed his escape, and his subsequent ability to slip inand out of others’ perception (consciously and unconsciously), to a “peculiartype of self-absorption which makes it impossible for people to be aware ofone.”3 This mental state, he added, “distracts people’s attention from oneautomatically, as a conjurer does deliberately.” Self-hypnosis, and perhapshypnosis of the observer, probably was the root of this. Whether or not he evermastered genuine invisibility, Crowley cultivated a knack for convenientinconspicuousness, a talent invaluable to a secret agent.Aside from magic, drugs, and mountain climbing, Crowley’s Mexican sojourn mayhave involved intelligence-gathering. His efforts among the Jacobites and theCarlists having proved his worth, the logical step was to send him furtherafield. An agent always needs a cover, a credible pretext to be somewhere or dosomething. Almost any British subject abroad was a potential asset, and it was apatriotic duty to keep one’s eyes and ears open and report anything noteworthyto the proper authorities.Britain’s greatest concern in Mexico at this time was oil. The Admiralty hadalready begun to contemplate oil as replacement for coal in powering the world’sgreatest fleet. Throughout the vast Empire, however, the black stuff was scarce.During 1900- 1901, the Admiralty’s presiding “oil maniac,” Second Sea Lord John“Jacky” Fisher, anxiously sought concessions in oil-rich places such as Mexicoand Persia. In Mexico they faced stiff competition from American oil-men such asEdward Doheny, who just happened to be on the scene staking claims for hisPan-American Petroleum.4In the end, though, a British entrepreneur, Weetman Pearson (later Lord Cowdry),took the lion’s share of Mexico’s oil. Pearson appeared just after Crowley leftMexico for San Francisco, which may be more than coincidence. The secret toPearson’s success was the personal backing of Mexico’s dictator, PorfirioDiaz—Grand Master of the same Scottish Rite Masonry to which his acquaintanceDon Jesus and more recently Aleister Crowley belonged. Freemasonry pervaded andsubtly influenced Mexican politics, which probably facilitated Pearson’svictory.5 Did Crowley the British agent help also cultivate Brother Diaz throughDon Jesus?A similar question arises about Crowley’s activities on the northern frontier ofIndia in early 1902. His outward purpose, again, was climbing, in this case adaring ascent of one of the Himalayas’ highest and most treacherous peaks, K-2(a.k.a. Goodwin-Austen or Chogo-Ri). The mountain lay on the vague northernboundary between British-controlled Kashmir and Chinese Sinkiang. Close by laythe frontiers of Afghanistan, the Russian Empire, and Tibet, the last a sourceof anxiety for the British. Tibet’s ruler, the Dalai Lama, was courting Russiansupport, and rumors abounded about the activities of the Tsar’s agents in theLand of Eternal Snows. St. Petersburg’s aim was to make Tibet a client state. In1903, such concerns led to an outright British invasion of Tibet led by FrancisYounghusband.6 The only easy route by which Russian agents and aid could reachTibet was through the passes and valleys close by K-2, making this region a richsource of information. The K- 2 expedition’s original leader, Crowley’s friendOscar Eckenstein, was arrested by British authorities on vague charges beforethey reached the mountain, putting the Beast in de facto control. Was that partof someone’s larger plan? The climb itself ended in failure after two tries,when Crowley called off the ascent to save the life of a comrade stricken bypulmonary edema.He displayed less heroism and compassion on his second expedition to theHimalayas in summer 1905. With a small team he attempted the formidable Mt.Kangchenjunga. Like K2 the peak lay near a strategic spot on the northernfrontier where India’s border met those of Tibet and Nepal. This climb ended ina mutiny said to have been sparked by Crowley’s tyranny and the deaths of fourmen in an avalanche. Whatever his past accomplishments, Crowley’s mountaineeringreputation, and his reputation as a whole, never recovered from his seeminglycallous and vindictive delay in helping the stricken men and recovering thebodies.In the meantime, the Beast made his way back to Britain, where in August 1903 hemarried Rose Kelly, the older sister of his Cambridge chum Gerald Kelly. Theirsix-year marriage was almost as severe a disaster as the attempt onKangchenjunga. Rose became the Beast’s first Scarlet Woman, an embodiment of thepowerful feminine spirit “Babalon” and all-around magical helpmate. Perhaps therole was too much for Rose, who soon fell into a downward spiral of alcoholismand insanity. In April 1904, in Cairo, she played her most important part in thecareer of the self-proclaimed Great Beast 666, To Mega Therion, by serving asmedium for the spiritual entity Aiwass in the channeling of the Liber AL velLegis, or Book of the Law. Crowley saw Aiwass as his “guardian angel,” andhimself as the prophet of a new age, the Aeon of Horus, and its new religion,Thelema (“Will”).A few months later, Rose gave birth to a girl, the grandly named Nuit MaAhathoor Hecate Sappho Jezebel Lilith. Out of either intense, albeit misguided,devotion or blind selfishness, Crowley dragged his wife and infant daughter withhim back to India in 1905. After the failure on Kangchenjunga, they alsofollowed him on a grueling trek through the wilds of southern China.This commenced in autumn 1905, soon after the end of the Russo-Japanese War. Thedefeat of a European power by an Asiatic one sent shock waves throughout theEast (and West), not least in China, which groaned under the weight of bothWestern and Japanese imperialism. Crowley’s route took him from northern Burmathrough the Chinese province of Yunnan and on into neighboring French Indochina.Yunnan was a major opium producer, but the trade’s future was uncertain. InChina itself, where an estimated quarter of all men were slaves of the poppy, acampaign was growing to curtail or ban the opium trade. Similar efforts wereunderway in Britain, which in 1906 stopped Indian opium exports to China. Thenext year saw an Anglo-Chinese pact to reduce export from, and cultivation in,China itself. Crowley was very much aware of this.7 The Beast recounts thatamong his goals on the trip was to “get available information about the effectsof smoking opium.”8 This in part served his personal interest in psychoactivedrugs, on which he eventually collected “a vast quantity” of data, but it alsoallowed him to collect intelligence about quantity, quality, price, anddistribution of the local product.9The anti-opium pact hurt France’s tax revenues in Indochina, where sale of opiumwas legal. Bordering Burma and Indochina, Yunnan had long been a sphere ofAnglo-French competition, no less since the recent entente between London andParis (1904). During Crowley’s sojourn, tensions were peaking because of aFrench construction project, the Yunnan-Tonkin Railway, that looked like a pathto annexation of Indochina. Crowley notes that the French had “flooded Yunnan-Fu[the provincial capital, today Kunming] with agents,” something a British agentwould notice where a simple tourist would not.A further clue to his ulterior motives is Crowley’s interest in a dubiousBengali doctor whom he suspected of writing anti-British propaganda, just thesort of intelligence that authorities back in India would have appreciated. Yetanother clue is his passing mention of having “settled my little official affairwith the Consul General” in Yunnan-Fu.10 That suggests that he made a report andreceived his due reward.With consuls and other eyes and ears scattered throughout south China, why wouldJohn Bull have needed the services of Aleister Crowley there? First, one cannever have too many sources of information, and as Crowley mentions withperverse satisfaction, many of those eyes and ears were not up to the task. Hewas especially disparaging of the abilities of the Christian missionaries. TheBeast, on the other hand, claimed special insight into the Oriental character.In matters such as opium, he brought other special skills to bear. Furthermore,an eccentric Englishman traveling with a wife and small child did not look muchlike a spy at first glance.After reaching the Indochinese port of Haiphong at the beginning of April, theMage sent Rose and Nuit back to India. He then set off alone across the Pacificand Canada, to New York and, ultimately, to England. His first stop, though, wasbustling Shanghai, where he lingered for a couple of weeks. One attraction therewas Elaine Simpson, a past sister from the Golden Dawn and a partner in bothphysical and astral sex. His eagerness to renew the affair helped motivategetting Rose out of the way.Again, there is the suggestion of an intelligence agenda in Shanghai. InConfessions, Crowley tells of using Tarot cards to solve the mystery of amissing packet of 80,000 rubles.11 The local “postmaster,” a German friend ofSimpson, was alarmed by the disappearance of the packet, which was addressed toa bank in Beijing. The mention of rubles indicates a Russian bank, and, ofcourse, if there was anyone London was more suspicious of in the Far East thanthe French, it was the Russians. The affair sounds like a scheme to track themovement of Russian funds. One interested party would have been the venerableInspector General of the Chinese Customs Service, Sir Robert Hart, a longtimeservant of the British Crown. The Beast certainly knew who Hart was. Some yearslater, Crowley recalled, via his literary alter ego Simon Iff, that “When I lastleft China—for my sins—I traveled in the same steamer as Sir Robert Hart.”12Using the Tarot, Crowley determined that the culprit was a junior clerk in theoffice, but the crisis ended when the missing money miraculously appeared at itsdestination after all. The postmaster and clerks involved were all employees ofthe Imperial Chinese Maritime Customs Service, a strange entity based inShanghai and largely run by the British, but employing many Germans and othernationals. In addition to its main job of collecting customs on foreign vessels,the Service ran its own postal service, policed ports and river traffic, androutinely collected intelligence about conditions in the Chinese interior.Having just come from Yunnan, the Beast could have given Hart’s outfit valuablehelp.Reaching London in June 1906, Crowley was heartbroken to learn that his tinydaughter had died of typhoid in Rangoon. He blamed Rose, fairly or not, and eventhe birth to them of Lola Zaza the next year could not mend the disintegratingrelationship. In 1909, he and Rose finally divorced. Two years later she, now ahopeless alcoholic, entered an asylum. Another casualty of the marriage’sfailure was his friendship with Gerald Kelly.Before their break, though, Gerald Kelly introduced the Beast to WilliamSomerset Maugham. All three men would eventually find themselves in the serviceof British intelligence. Maugham’s and Crowley’s paths would cross on more thanone occasion, and they developed a distinct dislike of each other. In 1908,Maugham published a novel, The Magician. The villain, Oliver Haddo, he based onCrowley, and the portrayal was ugly enough to make Crowley contemplate a libelaction. He did not pursue the suit, but neither did he ever forget or forgivethe insult.In the interim, the Beast plunged into his own writing, both poetry and esotericworks, and always deeper into magic. In 1907 he founded his own occult order,the A:.A:. This supposedly stood for Astrum Argentum or Argenteum Astrum(“Silver Star”), though others insist the true name was (and is) Adepts ofAtlantis.13 In any case, the group was less a secret society than Crowley’sprivate club, to which he admitted whomever he wished, however he liked. TheOrder even had its own official organ, The Equinox. The A:.A: drew aninteresting assortment of recruits, though determining who was a member can betricky. Actual or purported members include artists and writers such as AustinOsman Spare, Frank Harris, the Franco-Russian George Raffalovitch, and VictorNeuberg. Also involved were George Cecil Jones and the British-born journalistand future apologist for Stalin, Walter Duranty, with whom Crowley shared drugs,a mistress (Jane Cheron), and the occasional act of ritual sodomy.More pertinent to our inquiry, though, are the military members. One was aBritish Army officer, Capt. John Frederick Charles (J. F. C.) “Boney” Fuller. Hehad connection to military intelligence during the Boer War. Years later, Fullerwould become one of the founders of the British Army’s Tank Corps, a notedmilitary theorist and great admirer of Hitler. In this period, though, Fullerwas an admirer of Crowley and even wrote a book, The Star in the West, in praiseof his teachings.14Another important brother was a Royal Navy man, Commander Guy Montagu Marston.In his Confessions, Crowley describes Marston as “one of the highest officialsof the Admiralty,” a bit of an overstatement.15 According to his naval servicerecord, Marston was a navigation officer, and a good one.16 Nothing obvioussuggests an intelligence connection, or precludes one, but Marston’sparticipation in actions against slave traders and rebellious chieftains inAfrica during the 1890s shows an adventurous side. More intriguing was hisrequest to visit Russia around 1902 on undisclosed business. The Commander was“especially interested in sex, anthropology and magic” which doubtless explainshis attraction to Crowley.17 In May 1910, his secluded Rempstone estate inDorset was the scene of a magical “working” in which the Beast and hisassistants invoked Bartzabel, the “spirit of Mars.” Marston asked the spirit ifnation would rise against nation and received a prophetic reply that war withTurkey or Germany would come within five years.18 Besides his avid interest inthe occult, Marston’s other dirty little secret was a love affair with hiscousin, Daisy Bevan. In an odd coincidence (or not), her husband, Edwyn Bevan,was the brother of two other persons who would encounter the Beast, or hisreputation, a decade or so down the line.Marston could have provided an indirect link between the Mage and theAdmiralty’s Naval Intelligence Division (NID). If so, it would tend to confirmsuspicions about Crowley’s activities in Mexico and bear on those coming in theFirst World War. However, there also has been speculation that Crowley wasinvolved in a conspiracy to blackmail Martson by luring him into sexualrituals.19 Writer Paul Newman finds nothing to support the accusation, butCrowley’s proximity to an important naval officer might have attracted thenotice of other parties. For instance, by claiming influence with or overMarston, the Beast might have made himself of greater interest to Germanintelligence.From the intelligence standpoint, though, the most important of Crowley’sassociates in the A:.A: was Everard Feilding, or, to be exact, the HonorableFrancis Henry Everard Joseph Feilding, second son of the 8th Earl of Denbigh andbrother of the current Earl. Eight years Crowley’s senior, Feilding was a fellowCambridge-Trinity man and a former Royal Navy officer. Apparently leaving theNavy in the 1890s, Feilding prospered as a rubber planter in Malaya and attorneyin the high financial, and High-Masonic, circles of the City of London. Likeother friends of the Great Beast, Feilding took a strong interest in esoterica.A charter member of the elite Masonic Order of Christ (yet another groupclaiming direct descent from the Templars), Feilding was also a leading figurein the Society for Psychical Research. By 1907 he was its secretary. With theoutbreak of war in 1914, Feilding quickly received a lieutenant’s commission inthe Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve (RNVR), a typical accommodation forintelligence operatives. As we shall see, his subsequent duties belonged to thatrealm. Feilding almost certainly maintained some connection with NID before thewar.The poet and A:.A:. member Victor Benjamin Neuberg may have been innocentlyinvolved in espionage through his relationship with Crowley. London-born ofGerman-Jewish parents, Neuberg was in his late 20s when he met the Beast around1908 and became his lover, or at least a regular partner in homosexual (XI*)magical workings. During 1909-1911, the pair made frequent trips to NorthAfrica, a place Crowley found particularly inspiring. There they used John Dee’s“Enochian Aethyrs,” and plenty of drugs, to invoke the spirits of the Abyss.Much of their time was spent around Biskra and Bou Saada in northeasternAlgeria. The area was not as desolate and remote as Crowley suggests. Both ofthose towns and other spots he visited “were on the standard tourist circuit ofthe day,” enjoying a steady stream of European visitors.20 Indeed, Biskra gainedenough fame to later become the setting of Rudolf Valentino’s The Sheik. Theregion also boasted important Sufi monasteries (zawiyas), which may have helpedattract the Beast.Algeria, of course, was under French rule, though Paris’ control over variousBerber and Saharan tribes was always tenuous. While the years leading up to theFirst World War were relatively tranquil, French authorities always cast asuspicious eye on foreigners and guarded against espionage. Again, despite therecent entente, the French regarded Britain as a dangerous rival in NorthAfrica. According to Pierre Mariel, a writer who claimed connection to Frenchintelligence, Crowley and Neuberg’s activities drew the attention of the localpolice, the Services des Affaires Indigenes or “Blue Burnouses.”21 Following a“discreet” inquiry, they determined that the two Englishmen had come to the edgeof the Sahara for more than occult illumination. The pair, or at least Crowley,was quietly gathering information for “l’Intelligence Service.” If so, it was nodifferent that what he had done in Yunnan.Yet another possible player in Crowley’s prewar intelligence gambits was theAustralian-born A:.A:. member Leila Ida Bathurst Waddell, who had been presentat the Bartzabel ritual. The Mage met the thirty-year-old Waddell in Londonaround 1910 and soon made her his new Scarlet Woman. Leila was a talentedviolinist, and Crowley wrote that her exotic looks (she was part Maori), musicalability, and her strong sexuality “appealed to [his] imagination.”22 A vaguerumor holds that Waddell was married to or otherwise associated with a “navalintelligence officer.” There is, however, no evidence that she ever was marriedto anyone.23Among Crowley’s literary output in the period was a volume of poetry, The WingedBeetle, published privately in 1910. He dedicated the book as a whole to J.F.C.Fuller, and each of the poems to some other friend or acquaintance. Among theselect crew were Frank Harris, George Cecil Jones, Marston, Neuberg, andRaffalovitch, as well as Crowley’s wife and mother. The name of an up-and-comingpolitico, thirty-six-year-old Winston Churchill, is a puzzling name in thiscompany. The poem dedicated to him is “The Jew of Fez,” a brief ode to anunfortunate Hebrew who converted to Islam to get a red fez, only to be burned asan apostate for switching back to his yarmulke. This was, no doubt, an allusionto Churchill’s 1904 defection from the Tories to the Liberals, in whosegovernment he now served as Home Secretary. Crowley may have been commenting onWinston’s apparent tendency to follow political fashion instead of ideologicalconviction. If so, he was again a prophet; fourteen years later, Churchillreturned to the Conservative fold.The naming of Churchill in The Winged Beetle raises the intriguing possibilityof a personal link between him and Crowley, though there is no tangible evidenceof such. Still, there had to have been some reason for the Beast to single himout. In 1910, Churchill was a Freemason (albeit a casual one), and a brother insuch secret societies as the Ancient Order of Druids (the British parentorganization of the German Druiden-Orden), the Independent Order of Odd Fellows,and the British Order of Ancient and Free Gardeners.24 None of this proves apredilection for the occult, though Churchill entertained a certain curiosityabout spiritualism, mysticism, and the like.25 That might have made him curiousabout Crowley. Winston also evidenced admiration for such renegade and morallyquestionable figures as the Russian terrorist Boris Savinkov and theunscrupulous mercenary spy Sidney Reilly. Aleister Crowley would have fit rightin. In any case, this will not be the only instance where Churchill’s andCrowley’s paths will seem to cross.Also during 1910, Crowley became embroiled in two public scandals that wouldfurther blacken his reputation in the British press and public mind. The firstwas the so-called “Rosicrucian Scandal” that erupted in March when the Magepublished supposed Rosicrucian secret rituals in The Equinox. According to him,the “Secret Chiefs” commanded it. More likely, it was part of his ongoing feudwith former brethren of the Golden Dawn, particularly Macgregor Mathers. TheBeast managed to fend off the resulting lawsuit, but his act of spite would costhim dearly. Beyond the offense he gave to Mathers et al., Crowley’s flagrantindiscretion offended the values and sensibilities of secret society members ingeneral. These included hundreds of thousands of British Freemasons, many ofwhom filled the ranks of the Foreign Office and every other branch of theBritish Government. One person to enter the fray, though no friend of secretsocieties, was a self-appointed guardian of public morals named HoratioBottomley. His paper and personal soapbox John Bull scolded Mr. Crowley forbetraying his “solemn pledge,” the opening round of a bitter personal vendettaagainst the Magician.26The next flap arose in October, from Crowley’s public performance of the “Ritesof Eleusis” at London’s Caxton Hall. While the name referred to the ancientGreek Eleusinian Mysteries, Crowley’s extravaganza was really his homage to theseven planetary deities. The audience at the first, private performance wasprovided with a special treat, a mescaline cocktail to enhance their enjoyment.The Beast carefully observed the reactions. By the time they went public, theRites, presumably minus the mescaline, had become a theatrical spectaclefeaturing Crowley’s poetry and the musical talents of Leila Waddell. Theattendees got their biggest shock when the theater lights unexpectedly went outfor a brief spell.Although pretty tame stuff by modern-day standards, the show was enough tooffend some, and the Beast probably would have been disappointed if it had not.Leading the pack of the outraged was another newspaper man, De Wend Fenton,whose Looking Glass launched a series of scathing attacks on the performance andits mastermind. Fenton alleged that he had been kissed by someone—someone with amustache—in the darkened theater, and he was determined to shut the whole thingdown. Among other things, Fenton branded Crowley “one of the most blasphemousand cold-blooded villains of modern times.”27 The Beast preferred to dismissFenton as a cheap would-be blackmailer, but friends including Capt. Fuller andRaffalovitch pressed him to sue the Looking Glass for libel. After all, anattack on their guru was to some degree an attack on them, and by lettingFenton’s insults go unchallenged Crowley could seem to be admitting their truth.However, Feilding, a barrister, warned about the perils of such proceedings.Under British law, Fenton would be obliged to prove the accuracy of hisstatements to defend against a claim of libel, and even if he fell short ofproving that Crowley one of the worst villains of modern times, he undoubtedlycould dredge up plenty of dirt. That was the very trap Oscar Wilde had falleninto, a tragedy still vivid in the public memory. Thus Crowley might win thelegal case but still lose in the court of public opinion. Sound legal advice,but perhaps Feilding had other things to consider. What if Fenton stumbled uponevidence of Crowley’s work for His Majesty? That posed an intolerable risk ofembarrassment for important people. So, Crowley declined to sue, and thus lostthe confidence and friendship of Fuller, Raffalovitch, and others.In its 17 December 1910 issue, Looking Glass took a final poke at the Beast,noting a recent report that he had “left London for Russia”—a most interestingallegation that raises the questions of just where he was and why. Doublyinteresting is that on the same day Fenton’s paper alleged Crowley’s flight toRussia, London awoke to news of a horrendous crime the night before, one withits own Russian connection. A gang of “Russian anarchists,” Latvians and Jewsactually, were interrupted by police while trying to rob a jewelry store nearHoundsditch. In the ensuing hail of bullets, three constables died, and theculprits fled to the teeming East End. Shortly after the New Year, authoritiestracked some of them to a flat on Sidney Street. The man who took charge of thesituation, grandstanding for all it was worth, was Home Secretary WinstonChurchill. On his orders, troops in full battle gear surrounded the fugitives’hideout, and at least two of them perished in the resulting shoot-out andfire.28Crowley’s disappearance around the time of the original shootings would seemmere coincidence were it not for a later rumor that he was “more thanacquainted” with the alleged mastermind of the same anarchist gang, themysterious “Peter the Painter,” a.k.a. Peter Piatkow.29 While this allegation,like others, has to be taken with a large grain of salt, it merits a closerlook. The Mage had long professed a fascination with Russia and, as we will seelater, he was at least able to affect revolutionary sympathies. Cultivatingcontacts among the anti-Tsarist émigrés could have provided him with informationof value to such worthies as William Melville (still very much in the spybusiness) or even Home Secretary Churchill. That alone could have motivatedkeeping a low profile in the wake of the Houndsditch Murders. Might he even havegone underground or abroad to help find the killers?1910 also saw Crowley’s first known brush with German intelligence, in theperson of Theodor Reuss. About twenty years Crowley’s senior, Albert KarlTheodor Reuss, also known as Willsson, Frater Peregrinus, and Frater Merlin, wasa sometimes singer, druggist, and police spy. He also was involved withvirtually every contemporary secret or occult society.30 He started as aFreemason in 1876. In the 1880s, working for the Prussian political police, heinfiltrated the Socialist League in London, a group of radical Germanexpatriates surrounding Karl Marx’s daughter Eleanor Marx-Aveling. Eventuallyuncovered and denounced as Bismarck’s political agent, Reuss returned to Berlin,where he posed as a journalist. As such, he roamed the Balkans and the MiddleEast, covered the Greco-Turkish War of 1897, and almost certainly continued toact as a German agent.Around 1901 Reuss returned to London. By then he claimed to be the head of arevived Order of the Bavarian Illuminati, a high official of the esotericMartinist and Swedenborgian Masonic rites, and a Rosicrucian magus. This broughthim to William Wynn Westcott, a luminary of the Golden Dawn. From Westcott andothers, Reuss would have heard plenty about Crowley’s escapades.Reuss’ main achievement (with some help from the Austrian industrialist KarlKellner) was the creation circa 1902 of the Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO), the“Order of Oriental Templars.” Second only to the Illuminati, perhaps, the OTOhas earned a reputation as a center of conspiratorial skullduggery and even thedubious title of “the World’s Most Dangerous Secret Society.”31 As originallyenvisioned by Reuss, the OTO was to be an Academia Masonica that would unifyassorted Masonic rites with other esoteric orders into an overarching occultorganization. Reuss, who assumed complete control of the Order after Kellner’sdeath in 1905, cobbled together assorted lodges, orders, rites, and “churches”into a nominal esoteric confederation.The “great secret” of the OTO, and its main attraction for Crowley, was “sexmagic.” Roughly, this was based on the notion that sexual intercourse releasedprofound spiritual energy. Through concentration and the proper rituals, anadept could harness and direct this energy and even generate a “magical child,”a spiritual entity that would go forth and manifest the adept’s will in thephysical world. Crowley would become an avid practitioner of the technique.Outwardly, the OTO seems to have remained rather small and exclusive, thoughReuss tirelessly recruited, out of both spiritual zeal and vanity, but also touse the Order as a cover for German intelligence. It seems that Crowley firstcame to Reuss’ serious attention as a result of the Rosicrucian Scandal. Inspite of the Beast’s flagrant violation of sacred oaths, Reuss recruited him. In1912, in a Berlin ceremony, Reuss made Crowley the chief of the OTO branch inthe British Isles, the Ordo Mysteria Mystica Maxima (MMM), a mandate laterextended to English-speaking America. Thus he earned yet another magical name,Baphomet, after the mysterious idol allegedly worshipped by the Knights Templar.Immediately after his initiation, Crowley drafted a Manifesto for the MMM, lateradopted by the OTO as a whole.32 In it, he listed some twenty organizationswhose collective wisdom supposedly informed the new Order, among them theIlluminati, the Knights Templar, Knights of Malta, the Gnostic Catholic Church,and even, in the original edition, the Golden Dawn. He also offered animpressive, if improbable, list of mythical and historic members of the OTO’s“constituent originating assemblies.” Krishna, Lao-tze, Mohammed, and Moses wereamong those so honored, along with Roger Bacon, John Dee, and ChristianRosenkreutz. Among the more recent and intriguing names Crowley added CardinalRampolla, the former Papal secretary of state who some years earlier had givenhis blessings to Ashburnham’s Jacobites. Count Mariano Cardinal Rampolla delTindaro had almost been elected Pope in 1903, only to see his candidacy undoneby the fierce opposition of Habsburg Emperor Franz Josef. According to oneversion, Franz Josef ’s veto was stimulated by the revelation that the Cardinalwas a secret Freemason.33 Was that why Crowley later chose to list him among theOTO “saints”?Was Reuss’s recruitment of Crowley into the OTO also an attempt to lure him intothe Kaiser’s secret service? If so, were the Mage’s British intelligencesuperiors aware of it? More to the point, did they encourage it? Notably,Crowley’s association with Reuss occurred soon after a major reorganization ofBritish intelligence specifically designed to counter the growing German menace.The old War Office Intelligence Division disappeared, replaced with two newagencies. One was a domestic counterespionage section, the Secret ServiceBureau, under Army Capt. Vernon G. W. Kell, and the other a Foreign Section ledby Royal Navy Commander Mansfield Smith Cumming. In due course, Kell’s outfitbecame the Security Service, and Cumming’s the Secret Intelligence Service(SIS). Both secret organizations masqueraded as various subsections of militaryintelligence. During WWI, Kell’s counter-intelligence service adopted the coverof MI5, while SIS became MI1c and later MI6.Still, the Admiralty’s NID, which liked to refer to itself as the “IntelligenceService,” retained independence under the firm hand of Admiral W. Reginald“Blinker” Hall. The energetic, beak-nosed Hall was fascinated by “the world ofspies, agents, deception, bribery, disinformation, destabilization, all thatside of intelligence now stigmatized as the ‘Dirty Tricks’ department.”34 Hallalso controlled the main communications interception and code-breaking section,“Room 40.” Obsessed with secrecy, he routinely and unapologetically withheldinformation from other services.35In 1911 Parliament approved a new Official Secrets Act (OSA), which remains,with various revisions, in force.36 The heart of it was Section Two, whichforbade anyone “who holds or who has held” a position under His Majesty, orsimply contracted in any way with the government, from disclosing informationabout his or her work without lawful authority. Its most important aim was tokeep intelligence operatives quiet—permanently.37 The OSA was a sword hangingover the head of Crowley, or anyone else involved in covert activities,requiring great care in what was said or written.During 1911-1912 Crowley kept himself occupied with writing and magicalworkings, including another sojourn to the Sahara with Neuberg. He also foundtime for a torrid fling with a rich American expatriate, Mary d’Esti Sturges.Through Sturges, he made the personal and carnal acquaintance of one of herclose friends, avant-garde dancer Isadora Duncan. Duncan, in turn, may haveoffered some practical, or not so practical, tips for Crowley’s next venture asa theatrical entrepreneur. In early 1913, he recruited Leila Waddell and sixother young women to form the “Ragged Rag-time Girls.” With Leila as the lead,the troupe played fiddles and pranced about the stage in scant costumes, thecostumes probably being their chief appeal. After a brief and seeminglysuccessful premier at London’s Old Tivoli, in July Crowley took his performersto Russia with a contract to play Moscow’s Aquarium variety theater.38One might wonder why Crowley picked Russia of all places. The Tsar’s domainpresented a host of obstacles to foreign performers, such as the requirement ofpassports for the Beast and his charges, something not demanded of Britishsubjects in most other places. Nor, to all appearances, was the six-week stay anartistic or financial success, and the Ragged Rag-time Girls disbanded as soonas they returned safely to England. The stint did, however, stimulate theBeast’s creativity, and he poured out an impressive array of poems and otherwritings. He also had a brief affair with a masochistic Hungarian girl andventured off on some interesting side-trips, including one to the famous Fair inNizhni-Novgorod. He even wrote a poem about the experience, “The Fun of theFair.” In his notes to this, he reveals what really drew him there and to Russiaitself. “Though little agitation was apparent in the general atmosphere of theFair,” he wrote, “the shrewd, astute, subtle, lynx-eyed, past master,analytical, psychic, eerie, hard-bitten Secret Service Chief could nose therewas a certain discontent with the regime.”39 Russia might be Britain’s new allyagainst Germany, but that did not make London’s secret services blithe aboutwhat was going on there. In fact, Russia being an ally, its political stabilitywas of greater concern than ever. An eccentric Englishman leading a troupe ofdancing girls provided perfect cover for observing developments and contactingpersons of interest.Another sign of an intelligence angle to the Russian visit is the choice oftheatrical agent, Mikhail Lykiardopoulos, the Anglo-Greco-Russian secretary ofthe prestigious Moscow Art Theatre. As a translator of many English works,“Lyki” probably knew something of Crowley through his writings. Moresignificant, though, is his introduction of Crowley to the British commercialattaché in Moscow, R.H. Bruce Lockhart. “During the war,” Lockhart later noted,“[Lykiardopoulos] ran our propaganda department in Moscow under mysupervision—and ran it very well.”40 Thus, in short order, both men would beactively engaged in intelligence or para-intelligence work. One must wonderwhether Lyki was not already so engaged in 1913. He would have been an ideal andinvaluable contact for Crowley in Moscow. Lockhart, moreover, had clandestinecontacts with members of the revolutionary underground, the very sort of peoplethat the Beast would want to meet.Crowley later mentioned other contacts with British consular officials inRussia.41 These included Charles Clive Bayley, the vice-consul in Moscow. Bayleywill later appear in New York.Interestingly, Crowley’s arrival in Moscow followed shortly after that ofanother mystic, George Ivanovich Gurdjieff. Unsurprisingly, Gurdjieff is alsorumored to have had links to British intelligence. Most astounding is the claimthat he started life as Frederick Dottle, a Cockney orphan from London’s teemingEast End.42 After shipping out to the Russian Caucasus as a cabin boy, the storygoes, he became the adopted son of the Greco-Armenian businessman IvanGiorgiades, eventually drifted into the secret service of the Indian Government,and shifted to London’s control around 1907. Whether this tale is fact orfantasy, in the two decades preceding the First World War, Gurdjieff traveledaround the Near East and Central Asia and was poking around the borders of Tibetwhile Crowley was on K-2. However, there is no firm evidence that the two metbefore or during Crowley’s 1913 Russian trip.The final days of 1913 and the first months of 1914 were filled with moremagical workings and initiations, mostly in Paris, with Walter Duranty playinghis most prominent role. Crowley also made another mysterious visit toStockholm, gateway to Russia, early in 1914. Spring saw the Beast return to hisbeloved Alps, where in June he tackled Switzerland’s Jungfrau, near Interlaken.There he heard the ominous news of the assassination of the Archduke FranzFerdinand on 28 June. War was on the horizon.Crowley’s recollections of the next few months are replete with details, butvague and even contradictory in chronology. He seems deliberately impreciseabout what he was doing and where—perhaps with good reason. In Confessions,written in the late 1920s, he recalls a kind of panic that swept through theBritish community in Switzerland, inflamed by predictions that expedienttransportation back to England might soon become hard to arrange. Many fearedthat the Swiss would join the fight on Germany’s side.Undeterred by such worries, Crowley simply boarded a train for Paris, where helingered for a week admiring the sangfroid of the French as “they turned frompeace to war.”43 That argues he was there when Germany declared war on 3 August,which conflicts somewhat with assertions that he was in London the very next daywhen Britain proclaimed war on Germany. In a later press article, he claimedthat at the beginning of August he was in “a sick bed in Paris” laid up withphlebitis, an inflamed vein in his leg.44 In Confessions, though, he speaks ofphlebitis only after he reached England which supposedly left him bedriddenthere for six weeks during September and October. A diary entry pins down theonset of the malady as 7 September, the day after sex with a Piccadillyprostitute, which he blamed for the attack. This seems improbable, unless thebout aggravated an existing injury.To add to the confusion, in a later interview given to an American paper, theBeast asserted that “at the outset of the Great War [he] was in the confidentialservice of the British Government [and] in this service he was shot in theleg…”45 In a man of Crowley’s age and physical condition, the usual cause ofphlebitis is a penetrating injury, especially by a bullet. As for a climbinginjury, the only recent one he mentions is a bruised toenail acquired on theJungfrau.It is unclear whether this story was mere braggadocio for a gullible Americanreporter or an important clue about Crowley’s prewar secret service. The Magemay have been using his stay in Switzerland to collect information on theRepublic’s sizable population of exiled revolutionaries and related denizens.Perhaps he was following up on the Houndsditch/Sidney Street case. The allegedmastermind of that outrage, “Peter the Painter,” had vanished, and was rumoredto have sought refuge among the Alps with others of his ilk. Near thepicturesque Swiss town of Lugano was the thriving commune of Monte Verita, thede facto capital of the European counterculture and a mecca for rebels of everypolitical, spiritual, and sexual orientation.46 Whether Crowley ever visited theplace is uncertain, but it will figure prominently in Reuss’ wartime intrigues.According to the Beast, soon after his return to England, “I tried every meansto get the Government to use me—without success.”47 What he meant was that theyrefused him any sort of official job. No doubt he felt he deserved one. Asmentioned, his friend and adviser Everard Feilding had obtained a lieutenant’scommission in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve, and through it Feilding soonjoined the new Press Bureau as a naval censor. In fact, he was working forHall’s NID.“Blinker” dispatched men like Feilding to the censorship departmentto help in its work and to help maintain Admiralty control over the flow ofinformation. The Press Bureau handled different functions, including the releaseof official information. A related Neutral Press Committee disseminated news tofriendly and neutral nations, and a Military Room oversaw all press materialother than cables. The NID exercised direct control of the latter. The linebetween intelligence and propaganda thus blurred from the outset.The Mage may not have realistically expected to get a commission (though hecounted his Carlist adventure as practical military experience), but instressing to Feilding his knowledge of foreign languages, including Hindustani,and his expertise with cyphers, he clearly was making a pitch for a slot in thePress Bureau or the like. Another desirable slot was the War Propaganda Board,a.k.a. “Wellington House,” which came together in September.48 A hush-hushgroup, it recruited such well-known literary figures as Arthur Conan Doyle, J.M.Barrie, H.G. Wells, and G.K. Chesterton to churn out propaganda for domestic andforeign use. Chesterton, for one, was an admirer of Crowley’s writing, but thatsentiment likely was not shared by his superiors.The great obstacle to any official post for Mr. Crowley was his reputation, sobadly tarnished just a few years before. As the Beast recalled Feilding tellinghim, “you have a reputation for having committed every crime from murder,barratry and arson downwards. I am afraid there is nothing you could do.”49Except, of course, what he had done already, unofficially. Crowley’s talents,experience, and contacts had many uses, but none openly or in England.Of all the neutral nations, the United States was of greatest concern to thePress Bureau and Propaganda Board. For reasons considered in the next chapter,they were extremely concerned about German activities there. Without offeringany explanation of why or by whom, the Beast records that he suddenly “acceptedan invitation to go to New York” on commercial pretexts—an odd undertaking for aman devoid of any practical business experience. Nevertheless, on 24 October, heboarded the Lusitania in Liverpool and headed west.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 On Crowley’s relationship with various branches of Freemasonry, see: Martin P.Starr, “Aleister Crowley: Freemason!,” //freemasonry.bcy.ca/aqc/ crowley.html[http:////freemasonry.bcy.ca/aqc/crowley.html].2 CAC, 456.3 Ibid.

"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREE [../Text/contents.html] 010 [../Images/00002.jpg] AN IRISHMAN IN NEW YORK011 [../Images/00002.jpg] ANYONE PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION to the passengers debarking from the Lusitania on31 October 1914 might have noticed a well-dressed gentleman of about forty witha limp and an athletic build starting to go to flab. If he was hatless, acurious forelock on his otherwise bald head would have made him all the morenoticeable. A closer look would have revealed large, soft fingers festooned withnumerous strange rings.1 The liner’s passenger manifest listed him as EdwardAlexander Crowley, Irishman.2 No one would recognize the English magicianAleister Crowley—at least, no one who was not supposed to.One must wonder if Crowley ascribed any significance to the fact that he landedin America on Halloween. He would remain there for five years despite, accordingto him, near constant penury and assorted other difficulties.Why did he endure the hardships as long as he did? He had a job to do, one hedid better than he later dared admit. Looming over every word he would writeabout his American adventures in years to follow was the Official Secrets Act.Crowley therefore pretended to have served his country “playing a lone hand,”while hovering near the edge of destitution or worse.3 The reality, as will berevealed, was something quite different.The first problem the Beast encountered, right off the boat, was that thebusiness “invitation” that had brought him there had somehow fallen through. Heis, as usual, vague about the business, but his later reference to “the sinewsof war” signals that it must have concerned war contracts.4 He expected the dealto be worth “fifteen to twenty million dollars” (roughly $300 million today),though his end would have been only a modest commission. His likely role was asbag-man, conveying funds or financial instruments for contracts legal or not. Ifthe latter, his status as a complete unknown in the commercial sphere would havebeen an advantage.Crowley was operating against a backdrop of international intrigue anduncertainty in the opening phase of the war. As soon as war broke out,representatives of the European belligerents rushed to secure financing and warmaterials across the Atlantic, and American businessmen received them warmly.However Woodrow Wilson’s pacifistic Secretary of State, William Jennings Bryan,chilled such plans by declaring that U.S. law prohibited Americans fromproviding loans or military goods to warring nations. President Wilson himselfofficially proclaimed America’s neutrality on 5 August and the next day createda special Neutrality Bureau to police exports. As its head Wilson appointed anIrish-American attorney and Democrat Party hack, Dudley Field Malone, whomCrowley would later encounter.Bryan’s ruling did leave belligerent governments free to bring financialinstruments into the U.S. or raise loans there. Perhaps aware that Britishinterference could soon cut off access, the Germans were first to seek financingin America. In the second week of August 1914, a prominent banker from theReich, Dr. Bernhard Dernburg, set out on an urgent secret mission to New York.Passenger records show that he accompanied another traveler under the name ofAnton Mayer Gerhard.5 In reality, this was an even higher personage in theGerman financial hierarchy, Max Warburg, head of the powerful M.M. Warburg Bankof Hamburg and a financial mainstay of the Kaiser’s government. The Germans werecarrying $175 million in German treasury certificates to market in the UnitedStates.Dernburg and Warburg were headed for the New York City offices of Kuhn, Loeb &Co., a banking house closely linked to Warburg’s. Indeed, two of his brothers,Paul and Felix, were partners therein. Felix was also the son-in-law of thefirm’s grand old man, Jacob Schiff. Schiff, the Warburgs, and the other leadinglights of Kuhn, Loeb were all German Jews, most of whom maintained sentimentalas well as financial ties with the Fatherland. One could reasonably expect thatSchiff and his firm, reckoned the #2 financial house in America, would assistthe needy Reich.Schiff was glad to help set up a German war loan or purchasing credits butneeded help from other institutions, most importantly Wall Street’s foremostbankers, J.P. Morgan & Company. Ensconced at 23 Wall Street, Morgan was hostileto the German overture. The monetary and sentimental ties of the House of Morganwere firmly attached to London, and their clout on the American business scenemade them hard to contravene. Morgan’s allegiance ensured that Britain and herallies would enjoy access to America’s immense financial and industrial power,and Germany would not. This ultimately drove a frustrated Reich to sabotage andsubmarine warfare to stem the transAtlantic flow of arms and munitions.Britain, however, had another advantage in this clandestine battle, a spy insideKuhn, Loeb. Otto Hermann Kahn, German-Jewish born like his colleagues, was alsoa naturalized British subject, a man later hailed by the #2 SIS officer inwartime New York as “whole-heartedly pro-Allied and especially pro-British,” anda believer in the inevitability of Allied victory.6 Kahn is a prime example ofthe main weapon British intelligence used against the Germans in America—theundercover agent inside the enemy camp. Crowley’s ultimate mission in Americawould be the same. This does much to explain why he would later count bankerKahn among his “friends.”Max Warburg slipped back to Germany as quietly as he had arrived, but Dernburgremained to take on new tasks. Ostensibly, he ran the German Red Cross operationin New York. Actually, in close cooperation with Berlin’s Ambassador CountJohann von Bernstorff, Dernburg also assumed control of the German InformationBureau on Broadway. The Bureau fronted for a secretive Propaganda Kabinett thatcounted Harvard Professor Hugo Muensterburg, writer and occultist Hanns HeinzEwers, and German-American publisher George Sylvester Viereck among its membersand resources.7 Crowley would become intimately acquainted with all three. Thebasic aim of the Kabinett was to counter Allied propaganda and championGermany’s cause in America. Ultimately it focused on keeping the U.S. out of thewar, just as the British tried ever harder to bring the Yanks into the conflict.Meanwhile in New York, Washington, and London, interventionists and profiteerspressed for relaxed interpretations of American neutrality laws and nurtured thealliance between Morgan & Co. and His Majesty’s Government. By the end ofSeptember, the likelihood of a long war had become obvious; hostilities wouldlast for months, at least. A vast amount of money was at stake, and, as usual,what money wanted, money got. On 15 October State Department Counselor RobertLansing, soon to replace Bryan as secretary, asserted the legality of sellingwar supplies to belligerents. The floodgates were open; it became a matter ofmanaging the onrushing stream of orders. In mid-October two representatives ofthe British Treasury, Basil Blackett and statistics wizard George Paish, arrivedat 23 Wall Street. empowered to offer all British war purchasing to a singlefirm—Morgan. Supplemental agreements extended the same authority over mostFrench and Russian war purchasing.8On 31 October, therefore, following fast on the heels of Blackett and Paish,came George Macauley Booth, a “man of push and go” who was not only a Bank ofEngland director, but also soon to be Deputy Director of Munitions Supply.9 Hewas close to the “sinews of war” and authorized to handle a deal as big as theone mentioned by Crowley. Booth, in fact, arrived on the Lusitania with theBeast, and this certainly was no coincidence. Crowley was to have been one ofBooth’s minions or cut-outs in arranging contracts, but the deal with Morgan,with Booth’s immediate and enthusiastic support, obviated the Beast’s services.Independent commercial agents were no longer wanted or needed; his “egg wasaddled,” as he later put it.10But if such had been Crowley’s only business in New York, he would have hurriedback to England at once. The war-contractor role, though, was never more than aconvenient and potentially profitable cover for something else. Remember, everygood spy needs a practical reason to be where he is. The Beast’s employers backin London had other uses for him and did not leave him adrift. Despite laterclaims of near destitution, he was, in fact, far from penniless. By his ownrecollection, he arrived with some £50 worth of Yankee money in his pockets,about $5000 by 2007 standards. That would not last long in the Big Apple, but itdoes explain how Crowley could afford to take up residence at the St. RegisHotel, among the most expensive in Manhattan. Moreover, within days of hisarrival, he had a seemingly fortuitous meeting with an American “collector” whooffered to buy some rare books. Crowley at once summoned these from England,which put another $500-700 ($10,000-12,000) in his hands.The most important detail in this timely transaction is the identity of thecollector. John Quinn, a second-generation Irish-American lawyer, was aninfluential figure both in local politics and in the art world. An avidbibliophile, Quinn also enthusiastically promoted the artistic avant garde.11That provided a credible—but false—pretext for his interest in Crowley. Quinnwas an outspoken advocate of Irish liberty, specifically Home Rule, i.e. selfgovernment by an Ireland still firmly within the British Empire. In 1917, Quinn,Horace Plunkett, and George Russell wrote an Irish Home Rule Convention. While amoderate on the Irish Question, Quinn was also friendly with radicalnationalists, most notably the firebrand Sir Roger Casement, Quinn’s recenthouse guest.Quinn was not just being hospitable, for his less obvious but no less importantrole was that of British agent. Casement and others among Quinn’s Irishassociates would have been shocked by the admiration he enjoyed at the BritishConsulate at 44 Whitehall Street. and the information he offered there abouttheir activities. Sir Arthur Willert, chief correspondent of The Times in theU.S. during the war (later Secretary of the British War Mission) and anauthority on British clandestine activities, praised Quinn as one of the“staunchest supporters that the Allies, especially the French, had among theIrish-American leaders.”12 Quinn himself later boasted that he had “given mytime and my strength and my money to the pro-Ally causes of allnationalities.”13Quinn also had a long personal acquaintance with a past and future member of theBritish intelligence establishment, Claude Marjoribanks Dansey. In the yearsjust before WWI, Dansey was the secretary of the exclusive Sleepy Hollow GolfClub, to which Quinn and many other New York luminaries belonged.14 Upon theoutbreak of war, Dansey dutifully returned to England and took a post in MI5. Inthat role he would return to New York in 1917.Quinn’s immediate role as regards Crowley, however, was that of temporary caseofficer. He saw the Mage regularly at least through early 1915, inviting him todinners at his home as well as providing him with money and introductions.Quinn’s reflections on this relationship show that he did not extend the helpinghand out of genuine interest or affection. In letters to his friend WilliamButler Yeats, Crowley’s old nemesis from the Golden Dawn days (and one wonders,what did Quinn know of that?), Quinn repeatedly complained that Crowley wasalways in need of cash. On 7 January, for instance, Quinn was obliged to pay orloan our man another $100. Quinn opined that aside from Crowley’s love of drink,he could see “nothing wrong about him,” but neither did he praise him. He foundthe so-called Great Beast rather dull company.15 “Frankly his ‘magic’ andastrology bore me beyond words,” Quinn added, and he complained that Crowley had“no personality.” In place of a genius or even an amoral monster, Quinn saw only“a third or fourth rate poet.” “I have …no interest or curiosity in what he isdoing and have not taken up with him in any way,” he wrote, concluding, “He isnot my kind of person at all.”16Of course, Quinn may have been prevaricating in his letters to Yeats who, afterall, was well-connected to Irish nationalist circles and bound to repeat what heheard. Practically speaking, Quinn had to keep his distance from Crowley in casethe ties of either of them to British intelligence came to light. Thus, he mayhave tried to pass off their association as a disappointing indulgence of morbidcuriosity. Certainly his comments about Crowley’s poverty ring false. Not onlydid Crowley manage to maintain himself at the posh St. Regis for some weeks, buton 1 December he had the means to rent an apartment at 40 W. 36th Street. justoff fashionable 5th Avenue.Still, given Crowley’s manifest inability to manage money, finances were acontinual problem. That His Majesty’s officials were willing to use Crowley asan operative did not mean they were willing to pay him, generously or directly.It would not do for him to be found, dead or alive, with a check or receipt fromthe British Consulate on his person, especially if he was involved in anythingof dubious legality. Moreover, this was war, and a British subject was expectedto do his patriotic duty, however he cared to define it, without expectation ofpersonal gain.Undoubtedly the first and most important bit of news Quinn passed to Crowley wasthat Roger Casement had gone. Casement may well have been the original object ofthe Mage’s secret assignment in America. The Irish-born Casement was one ofthose charismatic and larger-than-life gentleman-adventurers who became nationalcelebrities in Britain’s imperial heyday. His sexual appetite was also large,but his promiscuous homosexuality was either unknown to or ignored by hisadmirers. In 1916, the same nation that knighted Casement would hang him as atraitor.By summer 1914, the volatile Casement had become a convert to militant Irishrepublicanism and was in America raising money for the cause. The war, hebelieved, gave Irish patriots a heaven-sent opportunity to make a daring bid forErin’s freedom through an alliance with Germany. He secretly contacted Germanrepresentatives in the U.S., including Ambassador Bernstorff and his militaryattaché Franz von Papen, and offered to form an Irish Legion to fight onGermany’s side in exchange for Berlin’s support for Irish independence.On 1 October, Bernstorff told Berlin about Casement’s proposal. Unknown to theAmbassador, Admiral Hall’s NID had intercepted the message. Four days later,Casement sent a manifesto (also intercepted by NID) to his followers in Irelandurging them to make common cause with Germany. In London, Hall and othersconsidered how to nip the danger in the bud. Quinn was one British agent put onCasement’s case, and Crowley was another.17 This explains why Crowley arrived inNew York as an Irishman, ready to swear his life to Irish freedom. Thatsentiment and Quinn’s ready introduction would have gotten him access toCasement. Casement would have appreciated Crowley as a man of adventurousreputation, apt for grand and noble enterprises. An added advantage wasCrowley’s real or assumed sexual proclivities. That the Beast, as alleged by atleast one source, aimed to use “sexual advances to get close to Casement,” isnot out of the question.18 Rumors about Casement’s sexual preference alreadycirculated in London, but lacked definite proof. If Crowley could get thatevidence, one way or another, he would have the power to destroy Sir Roger’sreputation and influence. The basic tactic was proven: a few decades before,another troublesome Irish politico, Charles Stewart Parnell, had beenneutralized by the exposure of his adultery.On 10 October, while Crowley was still in England, Casement and fellow rebelsJohn Devoy, Joseph McGarrity, Daniel Cohalan, and others met in New York’sGerman Club with Bernstorff, von Papen, and Dr. Dernburg. Devoy, a veteran ofEnglish prisons, the French Foreign Legion, and years of intrigue, backedCasement’s arrangement with the Germans, though he questioned Sir Roger’sability to pull it off. Had he realized that Casement had been carrying on thesetraitorous negotiations virtually under the nose of a British agent (Quinn), hisdoubts would have been graver. As it was, they were to prove well founded.Casement proved cleverer than Quinn and London thought.19 Berlin jumped atCasement’s plan and hastened to bring him to the Reich. Laying a false trail, heslipped out of New York on 15 October bound for Norway. Temporarily blinded bythis disappearing act, the British and Quinn still believed Sir Roger to besomewhere in the U.S. when Crowley set sail on 24 October.Casement duped the Lion but did not stay hidden long. On 28 October the BritishConsul in Oslo, Norway, picked up the trail when Casement’s lover, Norwegiansailor Adler Christensen, appeared at the Consulate offering to betray him, orso British sources alleged. As Christensen later told the tale, it was theBritish who, perhaps desperate after the failure in New York, approached himoffering money not merely to betray Casement, but to kill him.20 Britain’srepresentative in Norway, Sir Mansfeldt Findlay, denied this emphatically.However targeted, Casement gave London the slip again and arrived safely inBerlin on Halloween, the very day Crowley walked down the gangplank in New York.Quinn clearly was not cut out to be a spymaster, and with the flight ofCasement, he lost most of his value to the Beast, and vice versa. Feildingremained Crowley’s real controller, and behind Feilding, Admiral Hall and NID.Likely one of those two made the decision to keep the Mage in the States,necessitating a new and better-suited case officer. Forty-four-year-old Capt.Guy Reginald Arthur Gaunt was the British Naval Attaché in the U.S., and withthe advent of the war he also became the representative of Hall’s NID. NeitherMI5 nor SIS would have any presence in America until early 1916. Gaunt, for thetime being, was the ranking point man for British intelligence in the UnitedStates.21The Australian-born Gaunt had no experience in intelligence work, but he took onthe job with the same gung-ho attitude displayed in the rest of his navalcareer. Beneath his swashbuckling bravado, however, he was a bundle ofprejudices and insecurities often masked with vicious snobbery. Gaunt’s breezysailor act proved a big hit with the Yankees, and he enjoyed the sociallimelight. The onset of the war obliged him to spend most of his time in the BigApple keeping an eye on the Germans and overseeing the protection of vitalsupplies shipments. Gaunt quickly found himself saddled not only withcounterespionage, but also with propaganda and public relations duties as well.As a diplomatic officer, Gaunt could ill-afford to be caught doing anythingunseemly or illegal, such as spying. The likely result would be his expulsionfrom the U.S. and the acute embarrassment of HMG. Nevertheless, the garrulousGaunt simply was no good at keeping his clandestine role a secret. He complainedof clueless society women who button-held him at public gatherings to pour outtheir concerns about real or imagined German intrigues, but he also relishedtheir attention. Thus his German counterparts (von Papen, Naval Captain KarlBoy-Ed, Dernburg, and others) knew exactly what he was up to and did their bestto try to discredit him or lure him into a compromising position.22 Fortunatelyfor Gaunt, they displayed even less talent for the game than he.Gaunt and Crowley’s meeting was delayed by the Captain’s travels in late 1914and early 1915. He was in Washington when the Beast first hit Manhattan, but inDecember Gaunt took a tour of the Caribbean, only returning to New York in earlyFebruary. That likely explains the need for Quinn to play extended stand-in.Also, the visibility and vulnerability of Gaunt’s position meant that he had tobe extremely cautious about direct dealings with the likes of Crowley. Likewise,the latter’s usefulness as an undercover operative would be blown sky-highshould he be seen at Gaunt’s office or any other place associated with Britishofficialdom.Such detachment suited Gaunt just fine. One need not imagine that theirprofessional relationship, such as it was, necessitated any mutual respect oradmiration; Gaunt would have despised Crowley, but orders were orders. WhenGaunt later described Crowley to MI5 as a “degenerate…, age about 40; baldexcept for erect lock on hair of forehead; black eyes, athletic looking, but airof effeminacy; plump, soft hands; wears many rings,” he probably summarized hisown impressions accurately. 23When he also called our man a “pro-German propagandist,” Gaunt was onlyadmitting what seemed obvious, and the Captain also was performing his secretduty. Supplying such negative assessments to the Americans, even to otherBritish agencies, was part of the game to maintain Crowley’s cover. Except whenabsolutely necessary, one never reveals the identities of its agents, even to“friendlies.” It is the basic rule of compartmentalization. As a basicprecaution, one had to assume that the Germans had infiltrated MI5 and itssister agencies. However confusing such denunciations might be, they played avital role in validating an undercover agent’s story. Only a select few in NewYork and London had any business knowing Crowley’s true allegiance and purpose.This brings us back to the question of just what the Mage was supposed to bedoing in New York. Casement was long gone, but there remained a dangerous Irishorganization under such experienced conspirators as Devoy, ripe for exploitationby the Germans. Moreover, Indian seditionists also had allied themselves withthe Kaiser. As a proclaimed Irish sympathizer, a speaker of Hindi and otherIndian tongues, and an adept of an occult German lodge headed by one of Berlin’sagents, Theodor Reuss, Crowley was much too valuable to send back to London. Buthow would he fit into Gaunt’s apparatus?A discreet distance from the consulate at 44 Whitehall, Gaunt ran his spybusiness out of the Biltmore Hotel. There he conducted the flow of informationto and from his network of agents, a diverse group including a ring ofCzech-Americans led by Emanuel Voska and a “volunteer secret intelligenceorganization” connected to the U.S. Army’s Judge Advocate General’s office inWashington, D.C.24 The head of the latter was U.S. Army Maj. Herbert A. White,and his organization was the de facto investigative arm of the National SecurityLeague. Formed in late 1914, the NSL advocated “preparedness,” includinguniversal military service and a crackdown on anything deemed “un-American.” Italso was anti-German from the start, unsurprising considering that its financialmainstays included Frederic Coudert, T. Coleman Dupont, and most importantlyJ.P. Morgan, Jr. All were heavily invested in the Allied war effort.Gaunt’s dealings with White’s outfit were a manifestation of his own alliancewith, and dependence on, the Morganites, the single biggest Americanstakeholders in Allied victory. Gaunt later confessed to his SIS replacement,Sir William Wiseman, that one of his most fruitful sources of information wasMartin Egan at the Morgan offices. Technically, Egan was the firm’s “publicitychief,” but he also was the liaison, or cut-out, between Gaunt and Morgan’sprivate intelligence service.25 The Morganites engaged a small army of privatedetectives who guarded ships, docks, and warehouses, but they used moresophisticated agents as well. High up in this clandestine array, and in contactwith Gaunt, was a shadowy “Mr. Green.”26 Almost certainly the name was reallyGreene, and she was no mister.Among a list of sexual partners Crowley dutifully recorded in his Magical Recordappears “Belle Green.” This was Belle da Costa Greene, “a truly remarkable womanof color.”27 Born Belle Marion Greener, she was the daughter of Richard Greener,the first African American to receive a degree from Harvard. Faced with thesuffocating racism of her day, the bright, ambitious and well-educated Belledecided to deny her black heritage and venture across the “color line.” Herlight skin and green eyes doubtless aided this metamorphosis, as did a change inname that conjured a Portuguese grandmother to explain her exotic looks. Add tothis her taste for flamboyant, if ever tasteful, dress and jewelry and a stronglibido, and it becomes clear why she would have fascinated Crowley. For herpart, Greene favored liaisons with wealthy and artistically-inclined men (J.P.Morgan, Sr. and art scholar Bernard Berenson were two), but we may guess thatCrowley’s artiness (among other things) offset his poverty. His carnal dealingswith Greene do not seem to have been long or very satisfactory. Crowley foundfault with her “manner,” which probably reflects Greene’s dignity, independence,and refusal to submit to any man, even the Great Beast 666.In a note later expunged from Crowley’s autobiographical Confessions, the Beastfurther identified Belle as “one of the first people I met in N[ew] Y[ork.”28 LaGreene was the manager of the immense Pierpont Morgan Library at 29 E. 36thStreet. Crowley’s new apartment was conveniently less than two blocks away. In1905, J.P. Morgan, Sr. had hired the twenty-two-year-old Miss Greene to overseehis museum and its collections, a position she would hold for more than fortyyears. Under her hand, and with ample supplies of Morgan cash, the museum becamean eminent repository of rare books and art. Locating desirable works,negotiating their purchase, and assuring their authenticity all called forintelligence, caution, and discretion, attributes applicable to other forms of“intelligence work.” While she got along well enough with Morgan, Jr., hecurtailed the large-scale acquisitions of his father and even contemplatedselling off some the Library’s holdings to finance British loans. Under suchcircumstances, it would have made sense for Greene to offer her services to theAllied cause. She was the ideal person to head a Morgan secret agency undercover of the Library. She already had experience in ferreting out andinvestigating artworks and their owners. The same nexus could be used to furtherMorgan’s wartime interests—for example, by giving aid and cover employment to aBritish agent.Greene’s wide array of acquaintances notably included John Quinn; indeed, he wasa friend and confidant. In 1915, Quinn convinced Greene to hire, albeit briefly,French avant-garde artist Marcel Duchamp. He could have interceded likewise onbehalf of Crowley, whose wide knowledge of art and literature, particularly theobscure and esoteric, could have served the Library well. As a consultant toGreene, Crowley would have earned some money, kept in discreet contact withGaunt and, of course, gotten to know Belle more intimately. The person whoexpressed interest in “a complete set of my works and also two or three hundredmanuscripts,” a deal from which Crowley hoped to reap a hefty reward, probablywas Greene, not Quinn.29 In any case, the prospective buyer reneged on theoffer, just the sort of thing an ex-lover might do.More telling, however, in the same deleted note, Crowley recalled making a veryinteresting proposal to Greene. “I should pose as an eccentric philanthropist ofgreat wealth and collect indigent persons to found a new colony,” he began. Nextthese volunteers would board a chartered ship. Once safely at sea, the“colonists” would transfer to waiting British warships and quietly be landed insome “secret place.” In the meantime, the Royal Navy, using a captured Germansubmarine, would torpedo the colonists’ vessel and send it, and to allappearances its hapless passengers, to the bottom. The last step would besinking the guilty sub “in very shallow water on the American coast so that theevidence of the German crime would be obvious.” “The… passengers beingAmerican,” he added, “the operation would have peeved the U.S.A.”The logical question is why the Beast would make such an outlandish suggestionto the director of a library. It makes perfect sense if he and Belle Greene wereaware of their mutual connection to the British secret apparatus, and Crowleywanted her to approach Morgan about financing the operation. It would never dofor the British hand to show itself openly. What makes the plan all the moreintriguing is that it basically was a farcical version of the very real tragedythat would befall the Lusitania a few months down the road. That uncomfortablesimilarity likely lies behind the decision of John Symonds, Kenneth Grant, orsomeone else, to excise the story from Confessions.Yet another clue to Crowley’s clandestine connections in New York is hisassociation with John O’Hara Cosgrave, another Irishman and the literary editorof the New York World and its Sunday World Magazine. “Cosegrave,” as Crowleycalls him, first sent a “sob sister” to interview him at the dock.30 Over thenext year or so, Cosgrave went on to entertain Crowley at his home andintroduced him to the astrologer Evangeline Adams. On 13 December 1914,Cosgrave’s World Magazine ran an article on Crowley’s magical exploits. Whateverits accuracy, the piece served to advertise Crowley’s presence in New York andfirmly link him to the occult.Strangely, while the Beast was openly pro-German, Cosgrave was a firm backer ofthe Allies. In fact, the World itself would become a semi-official fount ofBritish propaganda. Like Cosgrave, its foreign affairs editor, Frank Cobb, was adogged promoter of London’s interests and, as we shall see, a close personalfriend of the future #2 SIS man in the U.S. Besides his duties at the World,Cosgrave was founder and editor of the muckraking Everybody’s Magazine, alsostaunchly pro-British and interventionist from the first days of the war.Cosgrave and Everybody’s had a cozy arrangement with London’s secret PropagandaBureau; the effusions of H.G. Wells, G.K. Chesterton, and other members of thatselect fraternity featured prominently in its pages. In light of that,Cosgrave’s quiet patronage of another British asset—Crowley-makes perfect sense.Much the same can be said for the Beast’s relationship with Frank Crowninshield,editor of the tony New York Vanity Fair. Crowninshield first met our man at aparty where Crowley amazed the multitude by accurately guessing theirastrological signs.31 He pretended to infer this solely from their appearanceand manner, probably having peeked at the guest list in advance. Crowninshieldtook a shine to Crowley and paid him to write pieces for his magazine on suchtopics as Japanese poetry and motion pictures. The important thing, though, isthat, like his good friend Cosgrave, Crowninshield was strongly pro-Allied. Alsolike Cosgrave, he was oddly unbothered by Crowley’s writings for pro-Germanpublications. Crowninshield’s avid interest in modern art also linked him toQuinn and Greene.By the close of 1914, with the subtle assistance of fellow British operativesQuinn, Gaunt, Cosgrave, and others, Aleister Crowley was positioned for his newmission. He would infiltrate the cabal of hostile forces busily plotting againstthe Empire in the security of neutral America. Indeed, he had already taken hisfirst steps into the enemy camp.Meanwhile, in Switzerland, an affair was unfolding that suggests the sort ofthing Crowley’s British controllers wanted him to explore. On 13 December, theNew York Times reported that Swiss authorities had arrested James Meyer, aGerman-born American citizen, on charges of spying for Germany.32 Evidencepresented at a Swiss military tribunal showed that Meyer used his job ascorrespondent for a German-American newspaper to serve a German “espionageagency.”33 Using his U.S. passport, he had made several trips to France, wherehe collected information later turned over to his German employers. He wasundone when he somehow left a package of incriminating documents on a trainbetween Geneva and Basel. Some helpful soul turned it in to the properauthorities. That is a scenario we will see again.The most significant detail for now, however, is that Meyer’s employer was theNew Yorker Staats-Zeitung, published by Hermann Ridder. Ridder was a closefriend of Franz von Papen and George Sylvester Viereck and a loyal collaboratorof the aforementioned Propaganda Kabinett. The Meyer case revealed a linkbetween German clandestine efforts in Switzerland and America, something personsin London were eager to learn more about.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 USNA, MID 9140-815/1, extract of British “Watch List”, p. 106, entry #340, c.1916.2 This and other details concerning the arrival of persons in New York aregleaned from the searchable online passenger list records, c. 1892-1924, atwww.ellisislandrecords.org [http://www.ellisislandrecords.org] [hereafter EIR].3 CAC, 754.4 Ibid., 745.5 EIR.6 Norman Thwaites, Velvet and Vinegar (London: Grayson & Grayson, 1932), 255.7 According to Viereck, Ewers and Muensterberg only attended the initial meetingof the Kabinett, but they certainly maintained an informal connectionthereafter.

"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR [../Text/contents.html] 012 [../Images/00002.jpg] SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY013 [../Images/00002.jpg] IN AUGUST 1914 AMBASSADOR BERNSTORFF’S superiors sent him back to Washingtonwith the authority and money to conduct sabotage. The latter would become avital part of Berlin’s secret war in America. While Bernstorff was aconscientious diplomat who sincerely wanted to maintain good relations with theAmericans, he also served his government loyally. He passed the dirty work on tohis military attaché, von Papen, a lanky, officious Prussian and an eager, ifinexperienced, conspirator. Crowley later offered that von Papen’s signal traitwas his “stultifying conviction that he was so much better than anybody else.”1The Kaiser’s secret services were organized on a standard pattern. The mainmilitary intelligence agency was the German General Staff’s Nachrichtenabteilungor Nachrichtendienst, most commonly known as Abteilung (Section) IIIb. For moreclandestine duties the General Staff also organized a Sektion Politik orSabotage-Abteilung. In the U.S., Military Attaché Franz von Papen was thenominal chief of all such activity. Not to be left out, the German Navy had itsown Nachrichten or “N” Abteilung , whose American operations fell under vonPapen’s Navy counterpart, Capt. Karl Boy-Ed, whom Crowley called a “breezy navalass . . . with the instincts of a gentleman.”2The “N” Abteilung maintained a close relationship with the giant Hamburg-Amerika(HAPAG) shipping line, which in turn employed its own security agents. Von Papenand Boy-Ed enlisted Paul Koenig, an experienced detective in HAPAG’s New Yorkoffice, to head a special “secret service bureau” charged with undermining theAllied war effort in North America.3 Koenig’s efforts commenced ineptly inSeptember with a bungled an attempt to blow up Canada’s Welland Canal.Undiscouraged, the Germans pressed on with other schemes.Also stirring the pot of German intrigue was Berlin’s Foreign Office, orAuswärtiges Amt (AA), which abetted Irish and Indian nationalists as well as anarray of separatists and dissidents in the Russian Empire. On orders fromBerlin, Bernstorff authorized von Papen and Boy-Ed to recruit Irish-Americans,Indians, and anarchists as agitators and saboteurs. In Berlin, an “IndiaCommittee” appeared, headed by Virendranath Chattopadhyaya, which aimed toignite a mass uprising against the British Raj.4 The main launchpad for theinsurrection was the neutral United States, whose West Coast Indian immigrantcommunities supplied recruits. The engine of this conspiracy was the Gadar orGhadr (“Rebellion”) Party. Violence erupted in October 1914, when JohnHopkinson, a former Calcutta police inspector who was ferreting out seditionamong Indians in Vancouver, BC, was shot dead by Mewa Singh, a young Sikh linkedto the Gadar Party.5To complement sabotage and subversion, the Germans planned an aggressivepropaganda campaign aimed at Yankee opinion, led by the Propaganda Kabinett. Theplan was to show the Americans the sound logic of strict neutrality and, failingthat, to bully them into it. Crowley would conspicuously advocate bullying.Direction and funding of this “public relations” effort fell to Bernstorff’scommercial attaché, Dr. Heinrich Albert.However half-baked some of the German schemes and their architects, by early1915 an Indo-Irish-German conspiratorial nexus was solidifying in America andthreatening havoc there and throughout the British Empire. In response Londonformed a special Interdepartmental Committee to deal with the Indianrevolutionary threat, including the chief of the Foreign Office’s North Americansection, Rowland Sperling, MI5’s Vernon Kell, and Admiral Hall’s specialrepresentative, Commander Guy Rayment.6 Rayment’s name we will see again in adifferent role.Admiral Hall was anxious about the mounting threat in America and convinced thatneutralizing it would require more than just counterpropaganda. He argued thatthe best way to combat German intrigues in the States was to expose them to theAmerican public and government, who would abhor the destruction of property andfomenting of rebellion on their soil.7 Following Hall’s logic, preventing Germanoutrages was not necessary or even desirable. Far better was to let them happenand then expose them. In fact, it might even be necessary to give the enemy alittle help. The beastlier the Germans, the better.Hall communicated these ideas to Gaunt, who was more than willing to carry themout. Also drawn into the effort was the aforementioned War Propaganda Board. ItsAmerican Branch, run by Canadian-born Gilbert Parker, had the writings of“extreme German nationalists” such as the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche andthe military theorist Gen. Friedrich von Bernhardi printed in English and madeavailable to American readers.8 Crowley’s activities would fit perfectly intoHall’s scheme. Thus it seems reasonable to suppose that the Admiral was theultimate authority behind the Mage’s assignment in America. As noted, throughhis connection to the likes of Feidling, Marston, and others, Crowley’s specialrelationship with NID probably predated the war.Hall’s strategy mirrors what Crowley later wrote about his own actions inAmerica. “Statesmanlike sobriety was, in the peculiar temper of the Americanpeople at that time, highly dangerous to British interests,” he wrote.9 “I knewthat the only way I could combat the influence of German propaganda in theStates was to identify myself with it in every way, and by making it abhorrentto any sane being, gradually get the minds of the American public to reactagainst its insidious appeal,” he noted. “My real scheme,” Crowley continued,“was to ingratiate myself with the other side that I should obtain their fullconfidence, and so be able to betray their plans to England.” He insisted thathe was “playing a lone hand” without direct authority from London, which mayhave been a crude version of the truth. As an undercover operative, Crowleyinevitably worked more or less on his own. As we have seen, however, that didnot rule out contact with other British agents or having to answer toauthorities in London.Crowley later attributed his penetration of the German clandestine apparatus tosimple luck. Sometime in early January 1915, he wrote, he was riding a bus upManhattan’s busy Fifth Avenue. With seemingly nothing better to do, he pulledout clippings from the British press and began reading. Seated close enough tosee the articles or overhear Crowley’s comments was a man he later identified as“O’Brien.” Sufficiently intrigued, or annoyed, O’Brien approached our man andasked if he was “in favour of a square deal for Germany and Austria.”10 Crowleyvouched that he was, and identified himself as an Irish patriot. O’Brien, a manof strong Fenian sympathies, invited Crowley to continue the conversation at hisoffice. The story, almost certainly, is bunk. One way or another, though, theMage got the introduction he needed.Upon visiting the address on O’Brien’s card, the Beast found himself at theoffices of The Fatherland, a weekly publication run by the aforementioned GeorgeSylvester Viereck. Viereck greeted his visitor warmly and reminded Crowley thatthey had met once before, in the London offices of the English Review. One hasto wonder whether the Mage had really forgotten that, and whether Viereck’spresence in London also brought him into contact with Theodor Reuss. In anycase, he and Crowley conversed vigorously about the war and attendant matters,and Viereck then and there offered him a job writing for the magazine. Crowley’sfirst contribution, the first of roughly a dozen, was “Honesty is the BestPolicy,” a turgid attack on perfidious Albion that ran in the 13 January 1915issue.11During his chat with Viereck, Crowley later claimed, he realized that TheFatherland was “the headquarters of the German propaganda.”12 TheEnglish-language Fatherland was subsidized by Dr. Albert ($1500 per month) withthe express aim of influencing American opinion. Beyond that, of course, Viereckwas a leading light in the Propaganda Kabinett. Thanks to him, the Beast was nowinside the enemy camp, and right where Hall wanted him.The helpful “O’Brien” seems to have been a convenient invention; Crowley himselflater used the pen name “Sheamus O’Brien” for a short piece on Sinn Fein writtenfor Viereck.13 More likely, his model was a real Irishman, Anthony J. Brogan.That Notre Dame graduate and fiery Irish partisan was a devotee of Casement,whom he recently had befriended in New York. Brogan also published a smallradical paper, the Irish American, which in fall 1914 he sold to none other thanFranz von Papen. Von Papen promptly handed over its assets to Viereck’sFatherland, including offices, probably the same ones that Crowley visited.British intelligence had been keeping tabs on Brogan through Quinn’s pal ClaudeDansey, but Dansey had returned to England.14 It seems a good bet that Danseyleft matters to Quinn, who pointed Crowley to Brogan, who, in turn, steered himto Viereck.Crowley later gave intimates such as Norman Mudd a different and simpler versionof his introduction to Viereck. In a 1924 letter to the FBI, Mudd wrote that theMage encountered Viereck and his factotum, J. Bernard Rethy, in November 1914“through some community of literary interest.”15 That might have been Quinn, oreven Belle Greene. Crowley “at once seized on the opportunity of getting intotheir counsels.” Fooled by his professed anti-Britishism, Viereck and Rethy“proposed collaboration.”Whatever his role vis-à-vis Viereck, the versatile Mr. Quinn had links to stillother German agents. On 14 November 1914, Dr. Kuno Meyer of Berlin, one of theworld’s leading authorities on Celtic languages and Irish culture, reached NewYork on the Dutch liner Rotterdam. His ostensible mission in the U.S. was tolegitimize German-sponsored Irish propaganda, but Meyer also took on a moresecret role, that of the “German brain” directing conspiratorial collaborationwith Irish and Indians on the West Coast. 16 On arrival in the U.S., Meyer gavehis local address as that of his “friend,” John Quinn.17 Quinn would have passedon anything he gleaned about Meyer’s mission.Meyer also had an interesting occult connection. He was a member of theVereinigte Alte Orden der Druiden (“United Ancient Order of Druids” or simplyDruiden-Orden). This was the German branch of a British para-masonic body formedin the late eighteenth century, the same one Churchill joined in 1908.18 Theavowed purpose of the society was the study and practice of ancient Celticmystical knowledge. By WWI, however, it also promoted a pan-German agenda,including an aggressive, expansionist foreign policy. Thus it was an idealrecruiting ground for Germany’s cause.Crowley’s old acquaintance Frank Harris also helped him penetrate the Germanapparatus. The fifty-eight-year-old Harris was another Irish native who hadtaken the boat to America as a child. As an adult, he moved back to London,where he became a successful editor, first for the London Evening News and laterfor literary publications such as the Saturday Review. Harris had unconventionalviews and eccentric friends besides Aleister Crowley. An outspoken defender ofOscar Wilde during Wilde’s travails, Harris also was a guest at WinstonChurchill’s wedding.Literature and an interest in the metaphysical brought Harris the Beasttogether. As editor of the British Vanity Fair, he had published a few ofCrowley’s literary effusions.19 Harris almost certainly was a brother inCrowley’s private A∴A∴ sect and contributed at least one piece to its organ, TheEquinox.20 By the time war broke out, Harris had met legal troubles and servedtime behind British bars. That plus his Irish republican sympathies helped sourhim on England, so he claimed, and he skipped back to the U.S. in fall 1914 as“Frank Vernon.”21 He and his mistress, Anna Strindberg, widow of the Swedishplaywright, landed in Gotham barely a fortnight before Crowley.Crowley met with Harris the day after arriving on the Lusitania. The two werebound to see each other, since Harris and his friend were at the same St. RegisHotel. In the States, Harris, like Crowley, promptly proclaimed his sympathy forGermany. In an early 1915 report to London, British Ambassador Cecil Spring-Ricecomplained that Harris’s writing evidenced “a profound detestation for Englandand a contempt for France.”22 Spring-Rice was certain that Frank Harris was“employed by the enemy.” In 1916, Harris took editorial control of thefoundering Pearson’s Magazine and promptly turned it into a “radical, anti-war”publication, much to the irritation of British (and, later, American)authorities.23 Harris also collaborated with the Propaganda Kabinett, whichbrought him into dealings with Viereck in early 1915, just when Crowley joinedThe Fatherland.Harris, like Crowley, may have been secretly working for London, and hispro-Kaiserian blather, like our man’s, a pose calculated to win the confidenceof the Germans. Whatever the truth, Harris definitely was busy ingratiatinghimself with German operatives in the U.S. and making contacts that would bevaluable to agent Crowley.Crowley made other contacts during his first weeks in New York. During November,for instance, he established ties with George Winslow Plummer, an Americanveteran of various esoteric groups and current head of the Societas Rosicrucianain America (SRIA). Plummer granted Crowley admission to that society, and theBeast reciprocated by certifying Plummer as an honorary IX degree adept in theOTO.24 The exchange shows that Crowley wasted no time exercising his authorityas head of the OTO for North America, recently bestowed on him by Theodor Reuss.As Crowley himself later noted, Reuss barely escaped England along with theGerman Embassy staff when the war erupted.25 This raises the possibility that heand the Beast bumped into each other, by accident or design, during thosefrantic August days. In any event Reuss promptly surfaced working for Germancounterintelligence on the Dutch border, no doubt trying to spot English agentshe had identified during his time in London. He soon moved on to clandestineduties in Switzerland.26 In recruiting Plummer and others into the OTO, wasCrowley earning more points with the Germans by engaging them as agents forReuss’ operation?The plot thickens further with findings by American investigators in 1917. Areport issued by the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) names Plummer,Crowley, and another British “spiritualist,” Holden Sampson, as members of an“occult German order … undoubtedly that of the Rosicrucian.”27 Reuss did onceproclaim that the OTO was “the exoteric front or showcase of a Rosicrucianorder.”28 The report added, however, that Plummer, Crowley, and Sampsonmaintained some mysterious means of communication with their “chief in Berlin,Rudolf Steiner.”29At first glance, the order in question looks to be the Ordo Templi Orientis, butthat is far from certain. Steiner certainly knew Reuss, and the latter had madehim the head of a “subordinate chapter” of the OTO in Berlin called MysticaAeterna. Nevertheless, Steiner’s relationship to the OTO by WWI is uncertain atbest. In 1912 Steiner had formed his own offshoot of Theosophy, Anthroposophy,and severed public ties to Reuss. Crowley later noted that Steiner had been “inrelation to the OTO,” whatever that meant.30One explanation is that the mystery lodge was the Antient and PrimitiveMemphis-Misraim Rite of “Egyptian” Freemasonry, arguably the proto-organizationof the OTO. Crowley and Steiner were both initiates, and at one point Reuss madeSteiner chief of the M-M in Germany. The M-M, however, does not quite fit the“Rosicrucian” label. The Americans may have simply confused Steiner with Reuss,or been misled. Perhaps Crowley invoked Steiner’s name as a means of maskingReuss’ role. To add to the confusion, the same report states that Plummer, notCrowley, was the “representative in this country” of the order.While Steiner had no outward association with German intelligence, a postwarBritish intelligence (SIS) report concluded that his religious training andinitiation into occult secrets “were all preparing him for a career of subtle,underground political intrigue cleverly disguised under the cloak of religiousillumination.”31 Where did they get that idea—from Crowley?Steiner definitely had influence in high German circles. In 1914, for instance,he was spiritual guru to the Kaiser’s mystically-inclined Chief-of-Staff,Feldmarschall Helmut von Moltke. Steiner also had connections to Berlin’sForeign Office and may have consulted for the secretive Sektion Politik on itssubversive activities.32 A hint of Steiner’s possible involvement in Germanintrigues in America is the testimony of a Russian revolutionary in New York,Ivan Narodny. Avant-garde dramatist, student of mysticism, and spy, Narodny in1914 was mixed up in a scheme to buy German rifles in the U.S. to aid anuprising against the Tsar. Among those involved in this murky plot was a German“noblewoman,” Marie von Sievers.33 She had the same name as Steiner’s longtimesecretary and recent wife, but whether they were the same person is impossibleto determine. Crowley was to become acquainted with Narodny, so perhaps theBeast knew the answer to that mystery as well.There must be a connection between the above ONI report and the later assertionby British espionage writer Donald McCormick (“Richard Deacon”) that Crowley“ingratiated himself with a Hermetic Sect in order to expose its head to theAmericans as a dangerous German agent.”34 Was that head in the U.S.A. orGermany, and was it Plummer, Reuss, Steiner, or someone else? This brings usback to Viereck and two other men closely associated with him and the PropagandaKabinett, German writer Hans Heinz Ewers and Harvard professor HugoMuensterberg.George Sylvester Viereck was born in Munich in 1884, the son of Louis (Ludwig)Viereck, a one-time socialist who, after a term in the Kaiser’s jails, renouncedhis Marxist ways and pursued a new life in America with his wife and son. YoungGeorge, or Sylvester as he preferred to be called, was a delicate only child. Hegrew up in an atmosphere of intellectual freedom, or perhaps indifference, whichpermitted him to indulge interests that ranged from classical mythology tosexology and to develop tastes that were at once refined, morally and sexuallyambiguous, and a bit morbid. Viereck liked to describe his as the “temperamentof a pagan.”35Also like Crowley, Viereck dabbled in poetry, and he shared with the Beast acommon admiration for Swinburne and his ilk. In 1904, Viereck published hisfirst volume of verse, Gedichte (“Poems”). The book earned praise from theGerman-American literati, including Hugo Muensterberg, who adopted thetwenty-year-old Viereck as his protégé. By the time war engulfed Europe, Viereckhad veered towards politics (he stumped for Theodore Roosevelt in 1912) and ablind, bellicose patriotism toward Germany. For that reason, in August 1914, hisfriend and mentor Muensterberg easily persuaded him to launch a magazine thatwould “counteract the expected onslaught of propaganda from England andFrance.”36 So was born The Fatherland.In the decade before WWI, Viereck attained some fame as a poet, though hisdecadent style had fallen out of fashion by 1914. He also wrote the 1907 Houseof the Vampire, a novel of psychological horror with a psychic, as opposed toblood-sucking, villain and a clear homoerotic subtext. Later in life, Viereck“made no secret of his own bisexuality,” and “from his youth onwards he had afondness for orgies.”37 Such tastes suggest an affinity for the sex-magicpracticed by the OTO. Did Crowley offer him initiation into that Order as he didPlummer?Viereck took a lively interest in occult matters. Like his pal Muensterberg, hewas a member of Schlaraffia, a German-speaking secret society with numerouslodges in the U.S.38 Outwardly Schlaraffia seemed a harmless fraternity. Basedin Hamburg, the self-proclaimed “humoristic” order attracted mostly artsy andacademic types and lampooned aristocratic manners. While replete with Masonesqueritual and symbolism, it lacked heavy occult overtones. On the other hand,Schlaraffia shared membership with more esoteric groups such as Sat B’hai andthe Royal Order of Sikha, the former one of the constituent orders of the OTO.So, there may have been more going on than met the uninitiated eye.39 Britishand American intelligence identified Schlaraffia as a “Secret German PropagandaSociety” that encouraged artists and writers to “spread German propaganda in asilent, secret way.”40 At the least, Schlaraffia provided a ready-made, secret,Germanophile organization with branches throughout the country—an ideal vehiclefor espionage and other covert activities.Crowley and Viereck had much in common. In his Confessions, the Beast discussesViereck’s character at length. Crowleyan analysis at once condemns Viereck as“mean and cowardly” and praises him as “one of the bravest of brave men.”41 Itlikewise calls him a writer of “great critical ability” and a crass opportunist.Suggestively, Crowley rejects Gaunt’s view that Viereck was just “one of thelesser jackals of von Papen.” More revealingly he cites Gaunt’s contemptuousopinion from their “correspondence on that subject.” Just when and in whatcontext did they discuss Viereck?Gaunt’s memoirs mention a curious incident that may illuminate his dealings withCrowley and Viereck. Early in the war, Gaunt recalled that he was “beingcontinually worried by a man in New York who professed to know all about Germanintrigues.”42 Gaunt tried to ignore him, but the man somehow managed to get intouch with Sir Edward Grey, the Foreign Secretary, who ordered Gaunt to see him.The reluctant Captain met the fellow in an antiane-and bric-a-brac-filledapartment in “a fashionable New York Hotel.” Gaunt lightly dismissed what theman said, especially his seemingly absurd claim to be the “illegitimate son ofthe Kaiser,” and reported back to London that the fellow was a “dud.”While Gaunt’s memoir is full of erroneous and self-serving interpretations ofpeople and events, he does not seem inclined to invent them out of thin air. Oneinterpretation of Gaunt’s tale is that the pest was Crowley. As noted, Gauntwould have been reluctant to deal with someone like the Beast and may haveneeded a kick in the pants from higher-ups. Gaunt freely tosses around nameselsewhere in his book, so it is odd that he avoids giving one in this case.Crowley himself records that Gaunt “affected to ignore the importance of TheFatherland” and with it Viereck himself.43 Did Crowley try to bring Gaunt andViereck together, only to have Gaunt snub the “lesser jackal”?More likely is that the man Gaunt interviewed was Viereck. For one thing, whileGeorge Viereck never claimed to be the Kaiser’s son, he did boast of being thegrandson of Kaiser Wilhelm I, a conviction he picked up from his father. Viereckeven told this to Crowley, who does not seem to have taken it too seriously. DidViereck do the same with Gaunt, only to have the Captain misunderstand thecomment or later misremember it? If so, the implication is that Viereck offeredto sell out his German brethren. Or was he trying to sell out Crowley?Another, possibility is that Crowley had “turned” Viereck using bribery orblackmail.44 That would explain why Viereck brought a British agent into theheart of the German apparatus and kept him there. Perhaps it also explainsCrowley’s ability years later to get Viereck to sign an affidavit that the Beast“had no trouble with authorities in the U.S.A.” during WWI, i.e., that he hadbeen loyal to the Allied cause.45 That, however, directly contradicted whatViereck wrote in his 1930 memoir, Spreading Germs of Hate: that Sir WilliamWiseman, the SIS man who succeeded Gaunt, swore that Crowley had nothing to dowith British intelligence.46 As we will see, though, Wiseman was a master ofdisinformation, and denying Crowley was only proper procedure. Moreover to admitthat the Beast had been in British employ would compromise Viereck’s ownjudgment and loyalty.Crowley was quite confident of his influence over Viereck. “I worked upon themind of Viereck to such an extent,” he later boasted, “that from relativelyreasonable attacks on England, he went to the most stupid extravagances, withthe result that he published the most futile rubbish from my pen.”47 Viereckclaimed to accept Crowley as an authentic “black magician.” He ran the Beast’swork not just in The Fatherland but also in his monthly literary journal, TheInternational, of which he eventually made Crowley editor.48 One could almostimagine that the Magician had cast a spell over Viereck. Crowley later gloatedof his ability to convince the gullible Viereck that a revised and blatantlyanti-German version of “An Appeal to the American Republic,” Crowley’s polemicin the November 1914 English Review, was just more “camouflage” to deceive thebone-headed English.49Viereck’s basic flaw, Crowley felt, was his repressed homosexuality. Whiledoubtless intelligent, he seemed to Crowley also plodding, oblivious, andgullible. Ultimately he found Viereck “not trustworthy enough to handle apropaganda involving the destiny of a people.” There had to be “a man higherup,” and the Beast was determined to find him.One candidate for this role was Viereck’s fellow propagandist, Schlaraffiabrother, and “great friend,” Hanns Heinz Ewers, the so-called “Edgar Allan Poeof Germany.”50 Ewers was a kind of Teutonic Crowley. His habitual monocle and adeep dueling scar across his cheek gave him the arrogant air of a Prussianofficer, which he combined with the cultivated amorality of Nietzsche’sÜbermensch. In fact, he had only the briefest of military experience. Hiscosmopolitanism led one Allied report to note that Ewers “might pass as anEnglishman.”51Early on, Ewers dedicated himself to being a “bad boy” of German literature. Hedeliberately sought to shock and appall decent society with tales steeped inblood, the supernatural, and moral depravity. His most famous work is the 1907novel Alraune (the basis of several films). It told the eerie and sordid tale ofa beautiful woman conceived by supernatural means to torment unfortunatemortals. Ewers created a literary alter ego in the character Frank Braun, abrilliant and callous adventurer with the unwholesome interests of an occultistand the clinical detachment of a scientist. Like his Kamerad Viereck, Ewerstried his hand at a vampire story. This was Vampir, in which the protagonist,based on Ewers himself, attacked women and drank their blood while in amysterious trance. What should interest us, though, is that the book is set inWWI New York, where the “hero” is engaged in secret work for Germany. Some ofits episodes were drawn straight from Ewers’ own escapades.Much like Crowley and Viereck, Ewers had an ambiguous sexual orientation, a keeninterest in drugs (including hallucinogens like mescaline), and a more thanliterary curiosity in the blacker aspects of the occult—an attraction to evilthat might explain his later gravitation to Nazism. Also like Crowley, Ewerstraveled widely, visiting South and Central America, China, India, and otherfarflung places. Ewers possessed an alternate identity as Ernest Renfer, aSwiss, with whose passport he undertook wartime secret missions to Spain andMexico.52 He was almost certainly working for Germany well before 1914, and helikely had at least an acquaintance with Reuss. Thus, it is not surprising thatCrowley and Ewers developed a mutual admiration society. Ewers, for instance,was intrigued by Bert Reese, a Polish-born “mind-reader” then popular in NewYork. Crowley recounts an audience with Reese supposedly connected with somevague business deal.53 Ewers may have sought Crowley’s advice in evaluatingReese’s psychic powers and the possibility of exploiting them for the Germancause.Ewers had other associations useful to Crowley. The German was socially andpolitically well-connected in both Berlin and New York. Ewers, for instance,enjoyed a personal pipeline to Ambassador von Bernstorff via mutual friendshipwith a Mr. and Mrs. Rachmann.54 On occasion he even passed himself off as arelative of Bernstorff. Dr. Albert and other German diplomats seemed deferentialto Ewers, perhaps afraid of his secret society and secret service connections.Ewers was not just a member of Schlaraffia but, according to a Britishintelligence report (possibly Crowley’s), one of its key “directors” both inGermany and the U.S.55Crowley actively courted Ewers by asking him to translate his Gnostic Mass, theOTO’s “central ritual,”a job that finally fell to Theodor Reuss.56 This bringsup another link between Ewers, Crowley, and Reuss. At 40 W. 36th, the sameaddress as Crowley’s flat, was the New York bureau of The Continental Times.This Berlin-based publication originally catered to Americans living in Europe.In 1914 the German Foreign Office appropriated the paper as a propaganda tool.Among other things, it was distributed to English-speaking prisoners-of-war,among them the ones Casement hoped to recruit. In Berlin, the official editor ofthe paper was “renegade Englishman” Aubrey Stanhope, but the real boss wasReuss.57 Reuss even listed the paper’s New York office as the American addressfor his Oriflamme, the “official” publication of the OTO.58 He also hadContinental Times reprint some of Crowley’s pieces from Fatherland and TheInternational. That Crowley and Continental Times shared the same Gotham addresswas no accident and must have been Reuss’ design. As a native English speaker,the Beast was an ideal man to oversee the New York office.Ewers, posing as a journalist, provided material to the paper.59 Moreimportantly, the Continental Times office helped him and other Germans getconfidential communications and even money to and from Europe. Crowley was thusperfectly situated to monitor the transatlantic currents of secret informationand funds. Still, Crowley soon concluded that Ewers was relatively unimportant.For one thing, his arrogance and disrespect irritated senior members of theGerman apparatus. At the initial meeting of the Propaganda Kabinett, he mockedthe“bovine stupidity”of the Kaiser’s officials, and Viereck considered him “toocolorful” to work in that environment.60 Moreover, despite his connections backhome, Ewers lacked the credentials to influence German-Americans.The man Crowley ultimately pegged as “the mastermind with whom [he] was to work,the secret director of German propaganda,” was the highly-respectedGerman-Jewish-American academic, Hugo Muensterberg. It is easy to dismissCrowley’s claim as mistaken or malicious, reasoning that a man of Muensterberg’sstature would never stoop to anything underhanded. Of course, anyone abovesuspicion is the perfect person for the job. Muensterberg undeniably belonged to(or at least associated with) the Propaganda Kabinett and vigorously supportedthe German cause up to his untimely and unusual death in 1916. Among otherthings, he personally lobbied his friend Theodore Roosevelt for Germany.The professor was just what the Beast described. A native of the Prussian portcity of Danzig, Muensterberg studied at Leipzig and Heidelberg and earneddoctorates in medicine and philosophy. He is best known, however, as one of thefathers of modern psychology. William James helped entice him to Harvard in 1892where, except for frequent visits to his beloved Germany, Muensterberg remainedfor the rest of his life. He took a special interest in behavioral psychology,which he applied to the classroom and the factory floor. His writings include apioneering work on the influence of motion pictures on mass psychology.61 AsCrowley accurately points out, the Professor was “someone who had made a specialstudy for years of the psychology of Americans,” a man of “ripe, balancedwisdom,” who as a teacher at Harvard had “acquired the habit of forming anddirecting minds.”62 Writing to a friend in early 1916, Muensterberg confessed,“day and night I work both before and behind the scenes almost entirely in theinterests of the political struggle, and fortunately thus I accomplish much.”63Crowley was already acquainted with Muensterberg’s less public and lessscientific interests. The Beast calls Muensterberg an “old enemy” with whom hehad quarreled concerning “philosophy and physics.”64 Muensterberg took a deepinterest in paranormal phenomena, particularly the activities of mediums andpsychics, most of whom he labeled frauds. In 1909, for example, Muensterbergdebunked the Italian medium Eusapia Palladino. He thereby contradicted aprevious study of Palladino by the British Society for Psychical Research.65Everard Feilding wrote the SPR report, which must have influenced thedisagreement between Muensterberg and Crowley.66Whatever their past differences, Crowley found a way to smooth over things withMuensterberg and influence him. Perhaps Herr Professor was not the skeptic heseemed. In any case, Crowley records that Muensterberg’s Achilles heel was the“great German gift of Always being Right.”67 By constantly reinforcing to theProfessor “how very right he was,” our man helped nudge the increasinglyfrustrated Muensterberg to abandon rational argument for “violent and stupid”rhetoric—just what Admiral Hall wanted.By the end of January 1915, Crowley was established in the offices of TheFatherland and the confidence of Viereck, soon followed by Ewers’,Muensterberg’s, and other German agents’. One secret job Crowley could havehandled at The Fatherland offices was bugging. Electronic eavesdropping was inits infancy in 1915, but Viereck later recalled that the Propaganda Kabinetttook active precautions against it. An engineer regularly searched meeting roomsfor hidden microphones. Nevertheless, a long-standing bug turned up in atelephone in a supposedly secure meeting room.68 Simply by observing the Germanprecautions and noting where they looked and where they did not, the Beast couldhave offered Gaunt a valuable service indeed.Crowley’s presence surely did not bring the Germans good fortune. Viereck notesthat German propagandists found it virtually impossible to keep their activitiessecret. “Every memorandum they ever made,” he wrote,“seems to have fallen intothe hands of the British Secret Service or the Department of Justice.”69 Nor wasthis the only thing to go wrong.On 25 February, New York papers reported the arrest of three men for trying tofraudulently obtain U.S. passports: Richard P. Stegler, Richard Madden, andGustav Cook. Facing the most serious charge, Stegler spilled his guts about abigger plot involving Captain Boy-Ed, Viereck, and Ewers. Stegler, aGerman-American and reservist in the Kaiser’s army, had approached Boy-Ed aboutreturning to Germany or helping the cause abroad—for money of course. Boy-Ed,according to Stegler, offered to send him to England as a spy. For that Steglerneeded an American passport in a new, non-Teutonic name (Madden’s).70 Hereceived an introduction to Viereck, who directed him to Ewers. Viereck admittedmeeting Stegler and giving him an introduction to Ewers, but denied any illicitactivity. He had helped, he insisted, simply because “Dr. Ewers was interestedin a psychological way in persons of peculiar characteristics, mental andotherwise.”71 Ewers, for his part, claimed that he spoke with Stegler to “humor”him and to get the bottom of what he suspected was a British trap.72 The Germanresponse, therefore, was that Stegler was a nut-case, and any funny business heattempted with passports was his own doing. With only Stegler’s word,prosecutors had no case against Viereck and the others. The publicity, however,eagerly exploited by Gaunt, further marred the German image. Ewers laterincorporated the episode into Vampir. His character Frank Braun, besidesblood-drinking, takes part in a German scheme to acquire U.S. passports.American authorities were coy about how they had gotten the goods on Stegler.Officially they credited an anonymous female clerk in a photographer’s studiowho became suspicious of Stegler and his efforts to secure a passport.73 Anotherpossibility is that Stegler’s lawyer, Mr. Griffiths, ratted out Viereck and theothers in hopes of getting a better deal for his client. Ewers may have been onthe right track by suspecting Stegler of being part of a British sting. Crowleywas perfectly situated to spot Stegler visiting The Fatherland offices or evendirect him there. Viereck and Ewers might have revealed the passport scheme tothe Mage as a trusted associate. The Beast would then have passed word to Gaunt,intimate of American authorities. If nothing else, Stegler’s aim of going toEngland to spy would have been of keen interest to “Blinker” Hall.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 CAC, 749.2 Ibid.3 Frank Rafallo (ed.), A Counterintelligence Reader: American Revolution toWorld War II, Vol. I, Chapter 3, “Imperial Germany’s Sabotage Operations in theU.S.,” www.fas.org/irp/ops/ci/docs/ci1/ch3c.htm[http://www.fas.org/irp/ops/ci/docs/ci1/ch3c.htm].4 Nirode K.

We last met Leila, eroticfiddle virtuosa, when she served as the star and den mother of the Beast’s“Ragged Rag-time Girls” in Russia. She may have been privy to the Beast’sintelligence duties in Russia. Whatever the case, now she was back in Crowley’ssphere and soon enmeshed in his new intrigues. Her lodgings at Manhattan’s HotelWolcott off 5th Avenue put her conveniently close to his lair on 36th Street.One of the first things she could tell him was what she saw or heard aboard theLusitania.The simplest conspiracy theory about the liner is that she was the victim of aGerman plot to destroy the pride of Britain’s commercial fleet. A secondary aimwas to teach a lesson to the Americans about the hazards of doing business withthe English. From this standpoint, the subsequent German claims that theLusitania carried concealed guns and a load of illegal munitions were justface-saving lies designed to excuse a terrorist assault on an unarmed passengervessel. On the other side is the argument, advanced most forcefully by ColinSimpson in his 1972 The Lusitania, that the “Lucy” was the victim of a Britishconspiracy hatched within the Admiralty. Simpson pointed an accusing fingerstraight at First Lord Winston Churchill, along with Guy Gaunt and others.According to this theory, these men set up the liner for destruction in order totar the Germans with the blame.1That does have a certain familiar ring. Besidesa belly full of munitions, Simpson accepts the notion that the “Lucy” carriedtwelve six-inch guns in her forward compartments. The fact that the shiproutinely carried crowds of Americans across the Atlantic was essential to theinsidious plan, argues Simpson, because the sacrifice of the Lusitania was partof a larger plot to bring the United States into the war.A few years after the appearance of Simpson’s sensational work, Thomas Bailey’sand Thomas Ryan’s The Lusitania Disaster appeared with the evident aim ofdebunking Simpson’s sensational charges.2 Given that much of Simpson’s evidencewas circumstantial at best, Bailey and Ryan picked apart many of his arguments,though not all. The duo dismissed the secret guns and a hidden cargo ofexplosive powder, though they accepted that the Lusitania did carry millions ofrounds of rifle ammunition, thousands of artillery shell casings, and othermilitary-related goods. Given that alone, they acknowledged that the Germansprobably had legitimate grounds to sink her. Nevertheless, they saw no credibleevidence of a British plot to steer the liner toward harm.In the early 1980s, veteran intelligence historian Patrick Beesly published Room40, an examination of British naval intelligence and its chief, Admiral Hall.3Beesly found it suspicious that the Admiralty failed to assign escorts toLusitania when she reached British waters. In essence, his conclusion was thatif the Admiralty’s leadership did not engineer the tragedy, they allowed it tohappen and shamelessly exploited the result. Beesly accepts that the anticipatedimpact on American opinion explains the decision to leave her vulnerable.In the absence of anything like a signed confession by Churchill or some otherconspirator, it seems improbable that such allegations can ever be proven.Anyone devious enough to do such a thing surely would leave no paper trail.Whether German, British, or other conspiracy sank the Lusitania, AleisterCrowley had a part to play.For reasons to be seen, the Germans sincerely believed that the Lusitaniacarried armament and munitions, and they made plans to destroy her well inadvance of the fatal U-boat attack. Whether the guns or munitions were real isultimately irrelevant. The Germans believed that the Lusitania was an importantand viable target, and some of those who helped convinced them were Britishagents.In his Confessions, Crowley boasted of having “proved that the Lusitania was aman-of-war” in a piece for The Fatherland published after the sinking. Accordingto the Beast, Viereck, like other Germans, failed to see that the article was an“extravagance which achieved my object of revolting every comparatively sanehuman being on earth.”4 Crowley, aboard the Lusitania only a few months earlier,could credibly claim to have seen the guns himself. So could Leila Waddell.Crowley elaborated in 1933 on his influence over Viereck and his Kameraden,asserting that he “gradually got the Germans to believe that arrogance andviolence were sound policy.”5 Again, that was precisely what Admiral Halldesired. The Mage spoke more candidly about his wartime work for the “NavalIntelligence Service” to the French press. He admitted encouraging U-boatattacks against neutrals to draw the Americans into the fray. His accomplice andimmediate chief in this endeavor, he added, was “capitaine Gount [sic].”6Crowley confided even more to his friend George Langelaan, whom he met in theearly 1930s. Langelaan is best known today as the author of the science fiction-horror tale The Fly, but he also wrote numerous spy stories based partly onpersonal experience. Langelaan, like Crowley, enjoyed a relationship withBritish intelligence, and that may explain why the Beast opened up to him.Langelaan revealed nothing of this exchange until the 1960s, and then only in anobscure French journal.7 Langelaan’s revelations look like a response toquestions about Crowley raised in another French magazine, Planete, a few monthsbefore. The Planete piece published anonymous allegations that the infamousMssr. Crowley was “responsible for the torpedoing of the Lusitania.”8According to Langelaan, Crowley’s influence reached to the top of the Germanclandestine and diplomatic hierarchies in the U.S. Through his connection to TheFatherland and the likes of Viereck, Ewers, and Muensterberg, Crowley rubbedelbows with Dr. Albert, Boy-Ed, von Papen, and even Ambassador Bernstorff. Thushe became more than a mere propagandist. Langelaan recounts that the Germanscame to place great faith in the Beast’s “intuition” and saw him as anindispensable guide to the mentality of the Americans and the British. Heespecially impressed them with his ability to predict the actions and reactionsof the British. It was almost as though he could see into the inner sanctums ofWhitehall.9 The possibility that he was a British double agent plying them withdisinformation apparently eluded them.Why would the Germans have found this phony Irishman and affected fruitcakecredible? The occult angle may explain it. Crowley’s reputation as expert insupernatural methods and forces would have impressed many of his superstitiousGerman collaborators and elevated their faith in him. These Germans would beneither first nor last in supposing such powers to have immense value inclandestine warfare. Then there was Crowley’s position as American head of theOTO and his intimacy with Reuss, who had influential friends in Berlin.As a result of this misplaced confidence, continues Langelaan, Crowley sat in atGerman strategy and policy meetings, including an intimate conclave hosted bythe Kaiser’s consul in Chicago, Baron Hans Kurt von Reiswitz. Just such agathering did occur soon after the 3 March 1915 arrival in New York of anotherof Berlin’s consuls, Franz Bopp, on his way to San Francisco. This war councilprovided an opportunity to allocate responsibilities and begin an expandedcampaign of propaganda and sabotage. Reiswitz was a close collaborator of vonPapen and up to his eyes in intrigues with Indians and others.10 Bopp (discussedmore in the following chapter) was to take up the same job once he returned toCalifornia.At this or a similar gathering, Crowley allegedly offered that the greatestdanger for Germany was America entering the war. After a suitable period ofreflection, the Beast argued that the best way to keep the Yankees neutral wasnot by reason and concessions but by a display of Schrecklichkeit(fearsomeness).11 America, a novice among the seasoned Great Powers, would becowed. He advised an immediate coup that might pass as accident even as itshowcased Germany’s willpower and ferocity. Someone in America forwarded theseideas to Berlin. The result, says Langelaan, was the destruction of theLusitania on 7 May.In reality the Mage probably played only a supporting role in the fate of theLusitania. Langelaan certainly misinterprets the Beast’s role as that of anindependent agent, likening him to a better-known British WWI operative, T.E.Lawrence. In fact, both Lawrence and Crowley were subject to the authority andscrutiny of higher-ups. However, the comparison is valid in the sense that eachwas a complicated and eccentric personality entrusted with a highly sensitivemission and inclined to act without or beyond standing orders. So, along with“Lawrence of Arabia,” perhaps it is not unjust to speak of “Crowley of America.”Langelaan also links Crowley to a larger British psychological operation aimedat the neutral U.S. According to this, British writer Norman Angell (Ralph Lane)was Crowley’s colleague in propaganda enticing America into the war.12 This wasan odd pairing even if neither knew of the other’s mission. An outspokenpacifist, Angell had opposed Britain’s entrance into the fray. He also was aleading member (along with Bertrand Russell) of the Union of Democratic Control,a left-leaning body that insisted the war be ended by a negotiated and “fair”peace.13 Yet those same credentials made Angell an ideal crypto-propagandist,visibly distancing his views from those of the British Government. Likewise, fewwould suspect the notorious and bizarre Crowley of serving His Majesty’sGovernment.Langelaan errs on at least one detail: Angell did not accompany Crowley over onthe Lusitania in late 1914. Angell did, however, show up in early 1915 for aspeaking tour of the U.S. His views appeared prominently in the New York Timesand other papers. The consistent thrust of his statements was that, while thewar was a human tragedy and must end as soon as possible, the United States’immediate moral responsibility was to hasten that end by unreservedly supportingthe Allies. As for the Lusitania, right after the sinking Angell argued for animpartial international court to investigate. In the same breath, though, heregarded Germany’s guilt as given; the “court” would just determine its degree.Angell warned Americans that they must become aware of Berlin’s methods of“inhuman warfare.”14 “I fail to see,” he added, “how America can let thisdastardly murder of its citizens pass.” Thus, as Crowley goaded the Germans toever greater aggression, Angell hectored America to do something about it.To fully appreciate Crowley’s role in the Lusitania affair, we need to examinesome wider aspects. The Admiralty briefly considered using the “Lucy” as anArmed Merchant Cruiser and registered her as such on 17 September 1914. Arefitting scheme called for mounting a dozen six-inch guns on her decks, butNavy authorities abruptly canceled the refit a week later. The official reasonswere that the 32,000-ton behemoth burned too much coal and that it presented toobig a target to be a fleet auxiliary.There was, however, another sound reason to return her to commercial service. On22 August, just before the Lusitania’s removal from the auxiliary list, threeRoyal Navy cruisers (the HMS Aboukir, Cressey, and Hogue) had a fatal encounterwith U-9 in the English Channel. The lone sub sank all three warships withtorpedoes. Crowley took note of this, as did others.15 A contributing factor tothe loss of the cruisers was a common engineering feature—longitudinal bulkheadsthat allowed water to flood the length of the ship. The coal stored there madesealing them quickly impossible.The Lusitania had the same weakness. If hit by a torpedo, she would begin tolist immediately, complicating or preventing the launch of lifeboats. A largeenough hole would sink her fast. In the event of a sub attack, therefore, thehuge liner was a floating deathtrap. Churchill and others in the Admiralty knewof this compelling reason to pull her from active duty. Of course, by ColinSimpson’s reasoning, one man’s Achilles’ heel is another’s ace-in-the-hole.Rumors that the Germans aimed to destroy the Lusitania surfaced as early asautumn 1914. In November, British author William le Queux, whose cash cow waspulp fiction about German intrigues, wrote to MI5 about his worries of enemysaboteurs planting bombs aboard the liner.16 A more serious warning came shortlybefore the ship’s sinking, in a letter from businessman-turned-politicianNeville Chamberlain. He passed to “5” allegations that German agents planned toboard the “Lucy” in New York with bombs, prime and plant them, and debark inLiverpool. The ship would sink in harbor with no passengers aboard.17However Chamberlain came by the story, the fact was that German agents, andAmerican ones, were working aboard the Lusitania during early 1915. Two of themwere Kurt (or Curt) Thummel and Neil J. Leach. This duo play an important partin the conspiratorial tale spun by Simpson, because both later testified to thepresence of concealed cannons on the Cunard liner. They were part of a plot, orplots, if not quite the one Simpson envisions.Thummel, a.k.a. Charles E. Thorne, Chester Williams, and other aliases,emigrated to the U.S. about a decade prior to the war. His name, or names, latersurfaced in connection with two sabotage cases, the Black Tom (1916) andKingsland, New Jersey (1917) explosions. In 1933, American claims investigatorsquestioned Thummel about his wartime activities.18 Thummel was vague ormisleading on several points, but the deposition offers a number of clues forus. From 1913 through May 1916, under the name of Charles Thorne, Thummel servedin the U.S. Coast Guard, then a branch of the Treasury Department which alsoencompassed the Secret Service and the Neutrality Bureau.19Thummel stated that during 1914-1915 he encountered a group of German agents inBaltimore. This was a local branch of Paul Koenig’s and von Papen’s organizationrun by Frederich Hinsch. Hinsch solicited Thummel to carry out clandestine workon behalf of his original Fatherland. Reluctant to admit to serving the Germanswhile in American uniform, Thummel told investigators he took Hinsch’s offeronly after his discharge. His secret assignment was to carry messages to Germanagents in Liverpool, the “Lucy’s” home port.American interrogators pointedly asked Thummel if he had been “detained” byBritish authorities. Thummel answered “no,” but cryptically admitted that he“came near being detained.”20 In fact, a few years earlier, the FBI had receivedan odd request for any records regarding “Charles E. Thorne alias ChesterWilliams,” who “was arrested by British authorities as a German spy during theWorld War.”21 The FBI politely but firmly noted that information “contained inthe Bureau files is considered strictly confidential and cannot be divulged.”22There also may have been something to hide.The truth was that Thummel undertook secret missions for Hinsch beginning inearly 1915, but he did so as an undercover agent of the U.S. Government.Evidence of this surfaced in his 1933 deposition, although it was convenientlyignored. Among Thummel’s papers seized in 1917 was a letter sealed in anofficial War Department envelope. In it a Sgt. Ehrhart addressed a Sgt. Braun tosay that the “bearer is a prospective recruit for regular service . . . he islooking for a special assignment.”23 Thummel simply denied that the letterreferred to him or that he had any idea how it came into his possession. Theinvestigators did not press the issue.Recall that the Wilson administration created the Neutrality Bureau to policethe shipment of war materials. Given concerns that the warring parties would tryto break or bend the rules, the NB spun off a special “intelligence” sectionthat extended its operations to Baltimore and aimed its attention almostexclusively at the Germans. As an employee of the Treasury and a native Germanspeaker, Thummel made an ideal operative. His first assignment was to insinuatehimself into Hinsch’s confidence. Next, in January 1915, Thummel (then “Thorne”)turned up in New York, where he signed on as a crewman aboard the Cunard linerSS Transylvania bound for Liverpool. He returned to Gotham aboard the Lusitaniaon 24 April 1915, using a new name. While in Liverpool, Thummel must have beennabbed by the British and saved his skin by revealing himself as an Americanoperative. That would explain being “almost” detained. Thummel also could haverevealed a German plan to plant bombs aboard the Lusitania, which would explainthe rumor picked up by Chamberlain. Admiral Hall would not have been shy aboutenlisting Thummel for his own purposes.On 26 April, soon after his return to New York, Thummel marched into Boy-Ed’soffice at 11 Broadway and added his voice to the charge that the Lusitania wascarrying concealed armament. There were four guns, he insisted, and he gave adetailed description of their appearance and hiding place. He also got two otherGerman seaman, friends Neil Leach and Gustav Stahl, to corroborate his tale.Crowley, of course, could have attested the same thing. Leach, an Irishman andBritish subject, had himself arrived from Germany in early March, a detail thatmay connect him to the Clan-na-Gael-Casement nexus and to Crowley. There even isa remote possibility that Leach, like Thummel and the Beast, was yet anotherBritish double. He was slated to ship out on the “Lucy” and would perish whenthe liner went down. Stahl seems to have been a mere patsy. Desperate to shoreup German claims after the disappearance of Thummel and Leach, he too swore tohaving seen the guns when he helped Leach move his seaman’s trunk aboard thedoomed ship. When that same trunk mysteriously turned up back at Leach’s oldapartment (returned there by Thummel?), Stahl was forced to plead guilty toperjury.The New York Germans, though they did not realize it, were the victims of aclever two-pronged con. On one side, Crowley, as devil in their ear, sowedrationalizations for destroying the Lusitania. On the other, Thummelconveniently turned up with more evidence of hidden guns, perhaps identical tothat described by Crowley. This could have been enough to overcome any lingeringinhibitions.If there was a British mastermind in this affair, it was probably not Churchill(who may still have played an accessory role) but Admiral Hall, who “wasprepared to use any methods [or persons] which seemed likely to achieve hisobjectives.”24 Hall’s man in New York was Guy Gaunt, and Gaunt oversaw Crowley.A instance of Gaunt and Crowley working hand-in-glove involves the warning thatappeared in New York papers on 1 May, right next to announcements of theLusitania’s imminent departure. The notice cautioned that British vesselsentering Germany’s maritime “war zone” were subject to attack, so that Americanstraveled on them at their own risk. The author of this warning was none otherthan the Beast’s employer, George Sylvester Viereck. Crowley probably eitherencouraged him to write the notice or was looking over his shoulder when he didso. In the wake of the sinking, the letter was prima facie evidence of apremeditated attack. Next, on the morning of the “Lucy’s” leaving port, at leastnine telegrams came to the ship warning prominent passengers in terms almostidentical to Viereck’s notice. The telegrams had all come from the offices ofthe Providence Journal, a small New England paper. Although no one seems to havetaken notice at the time, a close friend and collaborator of Gaunt, JohnRevelstoke Rathom, ran this newspaper.25 Rathom and his paper were essentialparts of the same British secret apparatus to which Crowley belonged.As with any plot or con, the fate of the Lusitania depended on a certain amountof luck. If the U-20 had not been charging its batteries at just the right placeand time, the liner might have sailed safely into Liverpool, but there wouldhave been the next voyage and the one after that. . . . Sooner or later, the bigship was bound to come into a periscope’s cross-hairs.The plot sketched above arguably seems too cold-blooded, too devious, andinvolved too many people to be real. After all, what kind of men would willinglysacrifice not only a great ship but also the lives of hundreds of innocentpassengers, mostly their own countrymen? A man like “Blinker” Hall for one. Asfor Aleister Crowley, he could have justified it all in Thelemic terms as anexpression of raw, ruthless “will”—in effect, the same thing he was selling tothe Germans. The war demanded huge, calculated, dispassionate sacrifices.Generals and admirals on all sides routinely made decisions that sent thousandsand tens of thousands to their deaths. The objective in every case was to hastenvictory and thus save hundreds of thousands. Mass civilian casualties were somuch collateral damage and part of the price of victory. Crowley could havethought of it as the expression of the violent new age of which he was theprophet, the Aeon of Horus. Old notions of morality no longer applied. Perhapshe made that very argument to Viereck and others.As for there being too many players to keep the conspiracy secret, only Hallneeded synoptic knowledge of it. Crowley and Thummel, even Gaunt, need not havebeen aware of each other or of anything else outside their immediate mission.Such an arrangement would have nurtured Crowley’s belief that he had been theprime mover all along.Hall and his plotters could count on widespread condemnation of the unrepentantGermans’ act. Whatever the logical or legal merits of their case, the Germansworsened the bad press with an ill-conceived propaganda gesture. The sinking ofthe Lusitania was touted as a triumph in the Reich, and a Munich artisan, KarlGoetz, took it upon himself to make a commemorative medal.26 The obverse bore animage of the unlucky ship, complete with guns and even airplanes on her decks,going down, with the motto “No Contraband.” The reverse featured a mob eagerlybuying Lusitania tickets from the Grim Reaper, and the words “Geschäft überalles” (business above all). The general impression in Allied and neutralcountries was of gloating and deliberate provocation of the Americans. The Beasthardly could have done better if he had designed it himself. Goetz may haveintended to satirize both British and German policies, but the devious AdmiralHall saw another opportunity. His agents obtained one of the medals and struck300,000 copies. These sold in Britain for £1 a piece and were held up,especially in America, as proof of German barbarism.27Thus Aleister Crowley took part in one of the most successful psy-ops in modernintelligence, with weighty consequences for Britain, Germany, and the UnitedStates. While the sinking of the Lusitania did not bring the U.S. into the warright away, it unquestionably had a profound pro-war influence on Americanopinion. The outrage gave the German cause a black eye from which it neverrecovered and was a critical step toward the eventual decision to intervene.Nevertheless, the American reaction to the Lusitania incident did nothing toundermine Crowley’s credibility with the Germans. It probably strengthened it.While the Yankee press fulminated and Washington dispatched a series of angrynotes to Berlin, Wilson did not declare war or even sever relations. Just asCrowley had predicted, it seemed, the Americans were too stunned and fearful todo more.One little noticed but important repercussion was President Wilson’s executiveorder, barely a week after the sinking, that established a special unit of theSecret Service charged with invigilating over German and Austrian diplomats andall their social contacts. No like measures were taken against British or otherAllied representatives. In fact, British and American intelligence began then toact in close, if unofficial, concert. The chief of Wilson’s Teuton-watchers wasFrank Burke, whom Gaunt’s “successor,” William Wiseman, later praised for havingalways been “extremely helpful in checking the activities of the enemy incooperation with British Military Intelligence.”28 What would a man like Burkemake of a man like Crowley?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 Simpson, The Lusitania (NY: Little Brown, 1973), esp. pp. 26-27, 78-101.2 Bailey and Ryan, The Lusitania Disaster: An Episode in Modern Warfare andDiplomacy (NY: Free Press,1975), esp. pp. 16-19, 70-82.

Aleister Crowley led the party, projecting aquiet gravitas. Among his companions were Waddell (with violin), Joseph M. Dorr(an “Irish editor” said to have published in Ireland and England), and PatrickGilroy (an “Irish agitator”).1 The rest, all said to be Irish to some degree,are unnamed. Crowley later offered that at least four of them were commondrunks.2 Also aboard, recording it all for posterity, was a reporter from theNew York Times.The journalist described Crowley as an “Irishman—poet, philosopher, explorer, aman of mystic mind—the leader of Irish hope.”3 He was “mild in manner, with theintellectual point of view colored by cabalistic interpretation.” “He is said tobe a close friend of William Butler Yeats,” the article added, an ironic sign toanyone in the know, such as Everard Feilding, of how Crowley felt about theexcursion.The launch gently cruised five miles down river into New York Harbor and droppedanchor off Bedloe’s Island, home of the Statue of Liberty.4 The originalintention was to land on the island and advance to the foot of Liberty, but anofficious guard (the island then hosting a military installation) turned themaway. Undeterred, Crowley and his companions remained on the boat a few yardsfrom shore. At precisely 4:32 a.m., a time Crowley had determined to beastrologically auspicious, he faced west, invoked the “one true God of whom theSun himself is but a shadow,” and commenced to “swear the great oath ofRevolution”—the Irish Revolution that is. Brandishing what he claimed was hisBritish passport (actually an old envelope), he tore the “token of slavery” intopieces and renounced “forever all allegiance to every alien tyrant.” In the nextbreath he swore to “fight to the last drop of my blood to liberate the men andwomen of Ireland” and called upon the freedom-loving Americans to support hisnoble struggle. “I unfurl the Irish flag,” he went on, “I proclaim the IrishRepublic. Erin go Bragh. God save Ireland!”It was a fairly convincing performance from a man who later claimed to know“almost nothing about the Irish question” beyond its being “a devil of a messand a devil of a nuisance.”5 Crowley did not stop there. He continued with anextended rant against England, “the enemy of civilization, justice, equality andfreedom . . . and the human race,” decried its numberless crimes againstIreland, and finished by proclaiming that “we do hereby declare war uponEngland” until Irish liberty should be achieved.His Majesty’s Government could have justifiably interpreted these words astreasonous. In early August 1914, just after Crowley returned to London,Parliament passed the Defence of the Realm Act (DORA) which gave the governmentsweeping powers of censorship and requisitioning and forbade a wide array ofactivities. Most relevant to the Beast, the Act criminalized anything “likely tocause disaffection to His Majesty.” Declaring Ireland’s independence and war onthe British Empire would seem to fit the bill.After the show at the island, the little crew, with Leila merrily fiddling someIrish tunes, sailed back to their starting point. Along the way they receivedenthusiastic greetings from sailors on the interned German ships lying offHoboken. Once ashore, everyone headed to “Jacks,” a rough-and-tumble all-nighteatery. As they made merry with food and ample drink, some twenty miles awayother events were unfolding that would crowd Crowley’s grand gesture off thepages of the Times until ten days later.In his declaration of Irish independence, Crowley claimed to represent “theSecret Revolutionary Committee of Public Safety of the Provisional Government ofIreland.” He billed himself as member #418, while Waddell was #11. Both rankingswere numerologically significant, 418, for instance, equating to the mysticalABRAHADABRA in the kabbalistic system.6 Perhaps the Mage had slyly conductedsome occult ritual before the great Goddess of Liberty.According to Crowley, the mysterious Committee’s immediate goals did not includearmed insurrection, but focused on anti-British propaganda and a “secret effortto dissuade Irishmen from enlisting in the English Army.” The Times reporteralso interviewed an American “acquainted with Crowley’s beliefs and intentions.”This almost certainly was Frank Harris, who opined that while the “Committeesympathize[s] with Germany in the present war,” active collusion with Berlin wasa mere expediency. The Secret Revolutionary Committee is highly unlikely to haveexisted outside of Crowley’s imagination, and he seems never to have mentionedit again.Crowley later voiced “displeasure” that the Times had reported anything aboutthe solemn events at Bedloe’s Island, as though he had invited a reporter alongexpecting otherwise. Indeed, the Beast elsewhere contradicted this by claimingto have staged the event to get attention by doing “something more public.”7 Thereal audience for the stunt was not Irish militants or the American public buthis German associates. “I did not feel that I was advancing in the confidence ofthe Germans,” he later wrote, and as a result he had been getting “no secretsworth reporting to London.” There was only so much he could do as a phonypropagandist. Crowley was auditioning for a bigger role.London took notice of his antics. Crowley recalled a response in certain circlesof “consternation,” and, as noted above, for good reason.8 He had neglected toclear his public performance before Liberty with higher authority. As a deepcover operative he was supposed to maintain a low profile, to work inside theenemy apparatus, not parade around with a gaggle of inebriates in front of theAmerican press. His anti-British tirades in The Fatherland and like publicationswere not likely to draw widespread attention in Britain; Hall’s censors and DORAcould keep them out of the public eye. In any case, they could be explained awayas the ranting in a pro-German rag of someone Gaunt dismissed as a “small-timetraitor.”9 The political theater at Bedloe’s Island was something else entirely.Crowley soon heard from Feilding, who must have asked something along the linesof “what the hell were you thinking?” Crowley records that Feilding was stillwith “the Intelligence Department,” i.e. NID.10 According to the Beast, Feilding“understood and approved” the recent actions but also cautioned that he couldnot authorize anything further without approval from unidentified higher-ups.Feilding was soon to go to work for a branch of SIS in Greece, and later servein the Middle East, but he would keep in touch with Crowley. The mysterioussuperiors would prove harder to convince. Whatever doubts they entertained aboutemploying the Beast must have been exacerbated.In response Crowley poured out his standard complaint that he could “find outexactly what the Germans were doing in America” if only given the “right sort ofassistance.”11 That undoubtedly included more money, but he also was pleadingfor greater responsibility. His unique talents were being wasted, including notonly his supposed magical abilities—hypnotism, divination, even invisibility—butalso a growing body of experience with drugs. He emphasized having the “absoluteconfidence, years old, of a man high in the German secret service”—almostcertainly Reuss. Crowley seems to have wanted to revive the Casement angle byoffering to use his Irish cover to spy in Germany, a gambit in which the Reussconnection could have been critical.The plan also may have included infiltrating Reuss’ operation in Switzerland.Through his connection to the Continental Times and the German grapevine in NewYork, Agent Crowley doubtless had picked up hints of plots brewing among theAlps. In fact, a very dangerous one was taking shape during June-July 1915—aBerlin-sponsored conspiracy uniting Indian revolutionaries and anarchists toassassinate Allied leaders across Europe. Among the proposed targets were LordKitchener, the President of France, the King of Italy, and Allied and pro-Alliedrepresentatives in the Balkans.12 British operatives, however, were able topenetrate and destroy the plot before it did any damage. One British agent whoplayed a part in this was the Mage’s old acquaintance and antagonist, WilliamSomerset Maugham.13 Maybe he got the job Crowley was after.The superiors decided that Crowley would stay right where he was. He could onlyexpress bewilderment at their “failure . . . to apply common sense to myproposals,” but they may not have rejected all of them. 14 Crowley does seem tohave gained approval for a wider range of action, beyond the streets and officesof New York.As noted, the real audience for Crowley’s recent histrionics was, of course, theGermans. By so publicly pulling the Lion’s tail, Crowley hoped to convince anydoubters in the German camp that he hated Britain, and there was nothing likepublicly proclaiming himself a traitor to do that. Viereck, for one, seemednotably impressed by the little show. Still, some of the Beast’s Teutonicassociates must have wondered about the seeming indifference of the British tohis baiting.This insouciance of British officialdom sharply contrasts with the case ofanother anti-British propagandist then running around New York, Ignatius TimothyTrebitsch-Lincoln. Born Ignaz Trebitsch, the son of a prosperous and piousHungarian Jewish trader, he is another enigmatic character whose bizarre andconvoluted career can only be briefly sketched here.15 He was at least asegomaniacal as Crowley, and far crookeder. Trebitsch also took an interest inthings metaphysical and would reinvent himself as a Buddhist monk years later.French esoteric scholar Rene Guenon later described Trebitsch as arepresentative of dark occult influences with a close connection to Crowley.16Another French writer, Pierre Mariel, even insists that Trebitsch was a memberof the OTO.17 There is nothing tangible to support such claims, but New York maynot have been the first or last place the pair’s paths crossed.About thirty-six in 1915, Trebitsch already had gone through a chain ofmetamorphoses—Talmud student, Christian missionary, British parliamentarian, oilspeculator, swindler, and spy. He played at espionage in the pre-WWI Balkans,peddling information simultaneously to the Bulgarians, Turks, and Germans. Backin England by 1914, Trebitsch briefly worked as a censor for the War Office (apost similar to Feilding’s) but aspired to bigger things. He apparently offeredhis services as a spy to the British and then, when they declined, to theGermans. He undertook a trip to neutral Holland that December, contacted theKaiser’s agents (was Reuss one of them?), and returned with what he said wereGerman codes. He tried to hawk these to Admiral Hall, who was not fooled. Thecrafty Hall, in fact, had been watching Trebitsch, and warned him to get out ofthe country as soon as possible. That could suggest that Hall recruitedTrebitsch as another double agent, or thought he had done so.In a flash, Trebitsch was on a boat to America, where he arrived on 9 February1915.18 He soon penned a series of anti-British articles (most, oddly, appearingin the New York World) that boasted of his work as a German spy.19 His actualdealings with the Germans in New York seem to have been limited. He visited theConsulate and The Fatherland’s offices, but was received with much suspicion,possibly stoked by Crowley.Unlike Crowley’s writing, Lincoln’s insults, or failure to perform his doubleagent duties, provoked British authorities to action. Scotland Yard quickly dugup an old and outstanding forgery charge, and His Majesty’s representativesdogged the Americans to arrest Lincoln, which they did on 4 August 1915.20London could easily have concocted similar grounds for arresting Crowley. Forinstance, a rumor that Crowley had been “chased from England where he fleecedsome society women out of money” was still floating around New York Policecircles in 1917.21 That the Mage avoided Lincoln’s fate, attests hisrelationship with influential persons in London.As further evidence of his loyalty and utility to the British cause, Crowley mayhave helped set up a much more serious blow to Berlin’s American organization.Recall that in May 1915 the Wilson Administration created a special section ofthe Secret Service to spy on the Germans and Austrians. The head of thehush-hush unit, Frank Burke, closely collaborated with Gaunt which directly orindirectly linked him to Crowley.A major focus of Burke’s attention was Viereck, whom his men watchedcontinuously. In doing so, they could not help encountering the Beast. As Burkelater told the tale, what ensued was pure luck. On 24 July, he and a subordinatetailed Viereck and an unknown German with saber-scars and a small, darkmustache. The latter was Dr. Heinrich Albert, the German secret paymaster. Burkeand his companion followed the pair onto an uptown El-train. Soon after, Viereckgot off at a stop very near Crowley’s address. Burke decided to stick with Dr.Mustache. As the train rolled on, Albert dozed off. Suddenly awakened at hisstop, he groggily stumbled out of the train, forgetting his briefcase. Burkeseized the case and ran off with it. He immediately shared his swag with Gaunt.Inside the case was a trove of compromising documents, including a scheme forestablishing a phony armaments company. Soon, with Washington’s silent approval,Gaunt leaked excerpts from the Albert papers to the New York World.22 Among thedetails revealed was Albert’s financial and editorial control over Viereck’sFatherland. The resulting flap was the beginning of the end not only for Albert,but for von Papen and Boy-Ed as well.Burke’s story is unlikely the complete or true one. Years later, Emanuel Voska,the head of a Czech spy ring and one of Gaunt’s key agents, took credit forstealing the briefcase.23 Voska’s involvement would imply that Burke was set onAlbert by the British, who knew that the good Doktor would be toting around somejuicy documents that afternoon. Who would have been in a better position toglean that information than the Beast? Albert’s oversight is easy enough toattribute to the familiar devils of bad luck and bad timing. Still, it wasawfully accommodating of him to nod off just when Burke sat behind him. Couldhypnosis, drugs, or some other occult influence have been at work? Going back tothe notion that Viereck was Crowley’s willing accomplice, did he, perhaps, slipAlbert some concoction put together by our man?Crowley’s contact with the Germans took a downturn with the departure of Ewerson a secret mission to Spain in mid-1915. One of Ewers’ special connections washis intimacy with Ernst Franz “Putzi” Hanfstaengl, later a member of Hitler’sinner circle. Although born in Munich, Putzi had an American mother and was aHarvard graduate, a detail that linked him to Muensterberg. One of Putzi’sclassmates, and a relation on his mother’s side, was then assistant secretary ofthe U.S. Navy, Franklin Roosevelt. Another classmate was the journalist andfuture Communist gadabout John Reed. Putzi ran the Manhattan office of thefamily business, the Franz Hanfstaengl Fine Art Publishing House, at FifthAvenue and 45th Street, not far from the Morgan Library. Indeed, J.P. Morgan Jr.and Belle Greene were among Hanfstaengl’s regular customers.)Putzi’s association with Ewers went beyond common interests in art, literature,and the occult.Years later, Irish radical labor leader James Larkin fingeredHanfstaengl as a German operative during the war and a man “having generalknowledge of the German sabotage work in this country.”24 Putzi was another partof Berlin’s secret apparatus, a front for payments to Larkin and others, and onemore source of information the Beast could have tapped through his associationwith Ewers.Ewers’ Spanish sojourns were carefully watched by British agents in Madrid.Again, Crowley was perfectly placed to tip them off. One British agent active inSpain was Crowley’s former friend, brother-in-law, and Golden Dawn acolyte,Gerald Kelly. Kelly’s case has some interesting parallels to Crowley’s. WhenKelly went to Spain in early 1917, his passport was provided by NID.25 Thatsuggests he was another of Hall’s men but, as with the Beast, he never receivedan official commission in the RNVR or any other service branch. A complicatingfactor is that Hall ran the intelligence operation in Spain as a kind offranchise for Cumming’s SIS. Thus, Kelly could have had a link to that quarteras well. Finally, Kelly sent back his reports on pro-Allied propaganda to JohnBuchan, then the chief of the newly formed Department of Information, successorto the War Propaganda Board.Kelly’s connections to Naval Intelligence and even his propaganda role roughlymatch Crowley’s. Furthermore, Kelly was somehow aware of Crowley’s activities inthe U.S. When someone in London asked him about the dubious activities of hisformer in-law, Kelly “advised leaving Crowley alone,” arguing that he was “anineffectual tool in the hands of the enemy.”26 That almost exactly echoesGaunt’s comments and, of course, more or less describes Crowley’s true role.Crowley’s biggest challenge with the Germans was new leadership and a shift inthe methods and strategy of their clandestine operations. On 3 April, a Swisstraveler, “Emil V. Gasche,” arrived in New York aboard the Norwegian linerKristianiafjiord (which may have carried more spies to and from America than anyother ship). Gasche was really Franz Rintelen von Kleist, captain in theImperial German Navy. He spoke perfect English, and his prewar career ininvestment banking gave him vital experience operating in the U.S. and Mexico.With his dark, refined features and cultivated manners, he looked and acted morelike an Italian count than a German officer. Given the obvious failure of theAlbert-Boy-Ed-von Papen triumvirate to staunch North American munitions toGermany’s foes, Abteilung IIIb sent in Rintelen with orders to “do somethingpositive” about the problem.27With this authority, Rintelen diverted money from Albert’s and the others’accounts to build up his own operations. These included the dummy armaments firmto tie up American production (revealed in Albert’s briefcase) and a frontorganization called Labor’s National Peace Council to recruit radicals toinstigate strikes and agitate for a general arms embargo. Rintelen also joinedforces with the “Wolf of Wall Street,” rogue financier David Lamar, a bitterenemy of Britain’s critical ally, Morgan & Company. Last, but not least, heembraced plain old sabotage, with the new twist of planting incendiary devicesaboard munitions ships. Rintelen was probably the best agent Berlin had inAmerica during the war, and his bold plans might have achieved much, given moretime. He ran rings around Gaunt, who, while aware of Rintelen’s activities, wasunable to frustrate most of them.Rintelen’s downfall began with an order to return to Berlin on 6 July 1915.Using what he thought was the still secure identity of Gasche, he was nabbed inearly August by Hall’s men when his ship stopped for blockade inspection inPortsmouth. Rintelen later blamed his rival von Papen for the arrest, accusingthe Military Attaché of stupidly (or deliberately) exposing his identity incables intercepted by Hall’s Room 40.28 It could just as easily have beenCrowley who ferreted out this precious information.Crowley could not have overlooked the incident that precipitated Rintelen’sabrupt recall. In fact, there is a strange synchronicity between it and hisperformance at the Statue of Liberty. That same morning, one “Frank Holt,”pistol in hand and bombs in his pockets, forced his way into J. P. Morgan’spalatial home on the north shore of Long Island. The Morgans, by another strangecoincidence, were enjoying breakfast with their guest, British Ambassador CecilSpring-Rice. It was never clear whether Holt’s intention was to kill thefinancier, or Spring-Rice or, as he later claimed, to kidnap Morgan’s children.In any case, he definitely came well-armed. The intruder managed to pump twobullets into Morgan before the burly banker tackled the smaller assailant to thefloor. Although seriously wounded, Morgan survived; his attacker ended up in thenearby Mineola County jail. The resulting media frenzy, which went on for days,bumped Crowley’s little escapade out of the limelight. If the Mage really hadobjected to press attention, he could not have conjured a better distraction.Under questioning, the prisoner confessed that he was not Holt at all, but ErichMuenter, a German-American fugitive wanted for the 1906 poisoning murder of hiswife in Massachusetts. In another twist, the prisoner also confessed to havingset off a bomb inside the U.S. Capitol the day before his attack on Morgan.Muenter had been a professor of German at Harvard and a friend and colleague ofHugo Muensterberg. Muensterberg later admitted recognizing “Holt” in news photosbut insisted he did not see any responsibility to reveal the culprit’s trueidentity to police. The Professor, though, was no disinterested party; he hadbeen in secret communication with Muenter for years. After hiding out in Mexicofor a while, Muenter had slipped back into the U.S. and as Frank Holt securedanother teaching job at Cornell University. No doubt Muensterberg helped.The immediate suspicion in Berlin was that Rintelen was the controlling handbehind Muenter’s outrages. After all, before his recent crime spree, thewould-be assassin had been quietly assembling time bombs for Rintelen’ssaboteurs. Should that link emerge in Muenter’s questioning, there would beserious repercussions for Rintelen, not to mention further marring of Germany’simage in American eyes. Thus, the wisest course seemed to be for Rintelen tobecome scarce. Rintelen and others must have given sighs of relief when on 6July, the same day of Rintelen’s recall, Muenter penned a farewell letter to hisfamily, walked through his unlocked cell door, and leapt to his death off ajailhouse tier. So the local coroner concluded, anyway.29However much Muenter’s crimes might have compromised Rintelen, Crowley must havesuspected another hand at work—“Moriarty” Muensterberg’s. The Professor wasMuenter’s longtime confidant and knew of his former colleague’s past crimes.That would have given Muensterberg plenty of leverage over the would-beassassin. Beyond that, Hugo Muensterberg was an expert psychologist. Who wouldhave been better able to analyze and manipulate an unstable, homicidalpersonality? There is a suggestion in the Muenter case of the nowall-too-familiar “lone nut,” and what today might be termed a “programmedassassin.” Crowley may have suspected something of the sort and wondered howMuensterberg had achieved his ends. Could hypnotic influences have beeninvolved, or some sort of drug? As we soon will see, Crowley had his ownexpertise in that sphere.Crowley’s Magical Record diary details his experiments with “sex magick” andother occult doings, along with more mundane things. However, his extant diariescontain a major gap, from 16 June 1915 until 25 February 1916. A diary for thisperiod certainly once existed, and it is suggestive that the entries for thisperiod, and a later part of his American stay, vanished while others did not.The gap began just as Crowley was questioning his intelligence assignment andlooking for new means to serve his country’s clandestine needs. It largelyobscures his journey across North America in fall 1915. This trip would signal anew and more active phase in Crowley’s covert activities, one never intended forany record, magical or otherwise.A major character in Crowley’s coming adventure was a new love interest, JeanneFoster (1879-1970).30 He met her in June 1915 and soon was, he said, in love.The thirty-six year old Foster was a mature, brunette beauty, educated,artistic, and (as her interest in Crowley shows) a bit wild. She was alsomarried. Born Julie Ollivier to a poor family in New York’s Adirondacks, shemade it to the big city through her marriage, at age seventeen, to a fortyishinsurance executive, Matlock Foster. In the years to follow, Matlock seems tohave remained oblivious or quietly tolerant of his young wife’s maritalindiscretions as she became first a popular model, then a journalist, and by WWIan aspiring poet. When Crowley met her, she was assistant editor of theinfluential American Review of Reviews. They shared a common acquaintance inJohn Quinn, and soon after dumping the Beast she became Quinn’s devotedmistress. Another of her friends was Belle Greene.In summer 1915, Crowley saw Foster as the perfect embodiment of the ScarletWoman and was determined to sire by her the son prophesied by his guardian angelAiwass in the Book of the Law. This naturally led to her initiation into the OTOas Soror Hilarion, and to regular sex-magic “workings.” Crowley affectionately,and symbolically, nicknamed Jeanne “The Cat.”Crowley and Foster’s relationship may have been partly professional. She hadworked as a reporter for the Boston American and other papers, and during WWIshe functioned as a “secret correspondent” for someone.31 That hints at a linkto intelligence—but whose? Her association with Crowley and Quinn suggests thatshe was another British asset, which might explain her accompanying Crowley onhis coming mission. She might also have served Morgan’s intelligence agency,reporting to Belle Greene, or Burke’s outfit, or some other American agency. Inany case, her job probably was as much to watch Crowley as to help him. Therewere those in both London and New York who trusted him little enough in theirsight, and even less out of it. Perhaps Crowley meant this when he laterlamented Foster’s “falseness.”32 Still, she and her elderly husband wouldprovide a handy cover for Crowley’s adventure into the American hinterland.For the trip Crowley acquired an alternate identity, further indication that hewas planning more than a holiday. He later used the surname “Clifford,” and musthave had some identification to back it up.33 He may have borrowed the identityof John Clifford, an Irish-born British subject living in New York as arespectable family man and banker. Clifford was the right age and, conveniently,yet another friend of Quinn’s. Clifford’s financial credentials, as we will see,could have come in handy.Further indication of agitation in Crowley’s affairs was his changes in address.At some point that summer, he quit the apartment on 36th Street and took upresidence first in suburban New Rochelle and then in more distant Philadelphia.He then moved back to Manhattan and was living in rooms above the AlpsRestaurant, a German hang-out on 57th Street, when he headed west. What drovethese peregrinations is unclear. Maybe it was just money; maybe he was trying toobscure his whereabouts and connections, or find someone, or lose someone.To understand what Crowley was about to jump into, we again need to pause toconsider the larger picture and introduce a few new players. During spring andsummer of 1915, the West Coast became a hotbed of German-inspired sabotage andsubversion. At the end of June, for example, American authorities seized theschooner Annie Larson off the coast of Washington, loaded with arms intended foran uprising in India. The immediate oversight of this and other German schemesfell to San Francisco Consul Franz Bopp, whom Crowley had probably met in NewYork in March. Bopp assigned hands-on clandestine duties to his vice consuls,reserve army officers Wilhelm von Brincken and Eckhart von Schack. Von Brincken,for one, had close ties to Irishmen linked to Devoy’s Clan-na-Gael. In May, vonPapen traveled west to confer with German operatives in Seattle.In addition to funneling money and guns to the Indians and Irish, Bopp and hisunderlings received orders from Berlin to sabotage munitions shipments andCanadian railways. In April, von Brincken paid a Dutch national, Henrickus vanKoolbergen, to blow up rail tunnels in British Columbia.34 Koolbergen, however,immediately betrayed the scheme to Britain’s man in San Francisco, Consul A.Carnegie Ross, who wisely advised the Dutchman to remain in the Germans’confidence. To make Koolbergen seem worth his salt, Ross arranged to have fakestories about damaged rail lines planted in the Canadian press. Ross, though,was seriously outnumbered by an amateurish but still dangerous enemy cabal.Bopp and his comrades employed other saboteurs. The most important of these wasCharles C. Crowley. He was a former special investigator for the U.S. AttorneyGeneral’s office in San Francisco turned private detective and generalthug-for-hire. Beyond sharing a surname with the Beast, C.C. even bore a certainresemblance—sheer coincidence, but possibly useful. C.C. Crowley recruited anassistant of the same cloth, Lewis J. Smith, an ex-cop from Detroit. From lateMay through mid-July, Crowley and Smith took credit for destroying a load ofexplosives in Tacoma, Washington and more railway sabotage in the CanadianRockies. In reality, they achieved nothing.Another man mixed up in the plans to cut the Canadian Pacific, and the likelykey link in Crowley’s coming mission, was a tall, handsome German nobleman namedGustav Konstantin Alvo von Alvensleben.35 Best known as Alvo, he was thewandering son of a Prussian Junker family. Landing in British Columbia around1904, all but penniless, he rose from rags to riches in a few years. By 1914, hewas a provincial celebrity and millionaire controlling huge investments intimber, land, and coal.36 Much of Alvo’s success stemmed from his secret role asfront man for a syndicate of big German investors, among them Kaiser Wilhelm IIhimself.37 Alvensleben was also a prominent Freemason and Schlaraffen. It wouldnot be at all surprising if he was OTO as well.With the advent of war, Alvensleben’s activities started to look suspicious tohis Canadian neighbors.38 He was fortuitously on his way back from Berlin whenthe war broke out and thereafter stayed safely on the American side of theborder. Whether Alvensleben was part of a German plot to take over BritishColumbia is doubtful, but there is no doubt that he abetted Germany’s secretactivities on both sides of the 49th Parallel. Canadian authorities seized allof his known assets, and German victory was the surest way to see his propertyand position restored.In spring 1915, Alvo brokered a secret meeting between Rintelen and the mostimportant German saboteur operating on the West Coast, Kurt Jahnke.39Alvensleben also was among the men von Papen conferred with during a visit toSeattle. Alvo’s business interests gave him access to numerous bank accounts andfinancial institutions, which he used to launder and move German funds. Chicagobecame Alvensleben’s main base of clandestine operations, and he was a closefriend of Chicago Consul von Reiswitz, who, according to Langelaan, invitedCrowley to that special gathering at New York’s German Club. Maybe Alvo wasthere too. Alvo even teamed up with a Lt. Baerensprung to arrange the dynamitingof railroad tunnels in B.C.40 Baerensprung, in turn, linked back to theaforementioned duo of C.C. Crowley and Smith and Bopp’s San Francisco cell.41Alvo was privy to almost every German secret work in North America.There is no hard proof that Alvo and Crowley ever met, much less conspired, butan abundance of common links and opportunities makes it probable. Some yearslater, Crowley noted a “Frau von Alvensleben,” presumably Alvo’s Canadian-bornwife, among his devotees.42 It had to have been one of the Baron’s relations.Crowley’s coming travels gave opportunity for him to meet von Alvensleben andcajole his cooperation. In addition to lands and houses, Alvo had other assetsin Canada: cash, bonds, and artworks that he dared not retrieve. Even his wifewas too closely watched to make away with anything substantial. However, someonelike Crowley, or rather Mr. Clifford, would not arouse suspicion. Crowley hadOTO business in Vancouver which would provide excellent cover for being thereand even accomplices if he needed them. With Alvo’s directions, Crowley might beable to secure some loot and bring it safely to Seattle. A grateful Alvo couldbe very useful. With him and a little luck, Crowley might be able to expose theGerman network on the West Coast and pocket a little money in the bargain.It would be interesting to know how much Crowley shared about his plans withthose British superiors. His journey surely received some sort of officialblessing. Just before his departure he noted receipt of a chunk of cash, by farthe largest amount he had handled in some time. With “traveling money” in hand,he was set to go.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 NYT (13 July 1915), 7, 10.2 CAC, 753.3 NYT, Ibid.4 Renamed Liberty Island in 1960.5 CAC, 750.6 Steve Jackson to author, 22 Feb. 2006.7 CAC, 753.8 Renegade9 Symonds, 199.10 CAC, 753.11 Ibid.12 Nirode K.

"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVEN [../Text/contents.html] 018 [../Images/00002.jpg] THERE AND BACK AGAIN019 [../Images/00002.jpg] CROWLEY AND THE FOSTERS ROLLED OUT of New York on 6 October. The sickly andsixtyish Matlock Foster must have been a drag on things, but he had at least oneuse. His presence reconciled the trip with the Mann Act, which made it a federaloffense to transport a woman across state lines for any “unlawful” purpose,which in most places included adultery. Crowley and Jeanne would have ampleopportunity to work on the generation of magick progeny while the old man wasasleep or otherwise out of the way. As for “secret correspondent” Jeanne,presumably she was along for the ride for more than sex.Crowley’s later account of his journey back and forth across North America isepisodic and vague. As for his reasons behind the trip, the most Crowley offersin Confessions is that he wanted to see the Pan-Pacific Exhibition in SanFrancisco and to “get first-hand facts about the attitude of the people [outsideGotham] . . . to the war.”1 As noted in the last chapter, San Francisco was thecenter of German intrigues on the West Coast, and gauging the mood of theAmerican public was not something that would interest our man alone. A yearlater, Gaunt’s replacement, William Wiseman, would dispatch another agent on amission covering much of the same ground. That operative, British playwrightHarley Granville Barker, sent Wiseman chatty reports on the public’s mood andopinions about the war in each town he visited.2 The Beast’s secret agenda,however, involved much more than passive fact-finding.Crowley’s other confessed goal on the trip was to pay a visit on a small groupof devotees in far off British Columbia. The roots of this went back to January1915 when Crowley gave his blessing to the creation of an OTO lodge inVancouver. At its head was Charles Stansfield Jones, a member of Crowley’s A∴A∴order and one of his prewar followers in London. The Mage knew that he couldtrust this devoted acolyte with a secret or two. Jones’ local circle includedanother young Briton, Wilfred T. Smith, and from the prewar London scene thepainter and dramatist Horace Sheridan-Bickers. Crowley also knewSheridan-Bickers’ wife Margaret “Betty” Dartnell-Bickers. In fact, he hadenjoyed a brief affair with her some years earlier and was now suddenly keen torekindle the flame. That, at least, was his explanation for some of whatfollowed. Jones, Bickers, and the rest had contacts in the local Masoniccommunity, which means one or more could very well have known Alvensleben—allthe more likely if Alvo himself belonged to OTO.Crowley may have had others to confer with in Vancouver. One was the local headof the Dominion Police, a no-nonsense Scotsman, Malcolm Nicolson Reid. Reid hadassumed control over the network of Indian spies and informants created by themurdered Hopkinson. Unlike Hopkinson, though, Reid could not speak or read Hindior other Indian tongues. Crowley, of course, did have such ability. Reid alsohappened to be the top Canadian cop looking for Alvo. On the other hand, forundercover operative Crowley, that could have made Reid someone to avoid.In the roughly ten days en route to Vancouver, Crowley visited at least threeAmerican cities: Detroit, Chicago, and Minneapolis-St. Paul. His pressing errandin the Motor City was a visit to the Parke-Davis pharmaceutical plant. There the“rhythmical” mass production of pills and potions mesmerized him, but his realgoal was scoring a big stash of pharmaceutically refined peyote, the psychedelicwith which he had dosed audiences at the Rites of Eleusis. He appreciated thedrug’s ability to generate profound “altered states of consciousness” and musthave been glad at the prospect of using it ceremoniously in Vancouver. But hemay have had other uses in mind as well.Eighteen years later, Nazi doctors at the Dachau concentration camp gave massivemescaline doses to prisoners in hope of achieving “chemical hypnosis.” Britishinterrogators dabbled with the same drug during WWII. The net result of theseand like experiments was that the drug could amplify the effectiveness ofinterrogation techniques if properly administered. After WWII, the U.S. Navy’s“Operation Chatter” continued to experiment with mescaline as a “speech-inducingagent.”3 The same and related psychedelics featured prominently in the CIA’ssecret MK ULTRA mind-control projects, which flourished throughout the 1950s and1960s.Crowley, circumstantial evidence suggests, was a pioneer in this bizarre field,and his groundbreaking work may have informed some of those later experiments.He once boasted, “I have myself made extensive and elaborate studies of theeffects of indulgence in stimulants and narcotics,” and produced “a vastquantity of unpublished data” on the subject.4 Throughout his American stay, theBeast routinely administered mescaline or other drugs to willing andunsuspecting subjects (spicy curries were a favorite means), methodicallycataloging the results.5 These observations ended up in another of his journals,Liber CMXXXIV, The Cactus, which he described as an “elaborate study of thepsychological effects produced by Anhalonium Lewinii . . . compiled from theactual records of some hundreds of experiments.”6 The Cactus vanished after thewar.When Crowley came to Detroit, Louis J. Smith was living inconspicuously as aMotor City auto worker. Recall that he and his partner C.C. Crowley had beenBopp’s main saboteurs of Canadian railroads. Their ineptitude so disgusted Boppthat he cut the pair loose and banished Smith to the Midwest. Tipped off, agentsof the U.S. Department of Justice’s Bureau of Investigation, or BI (precursor ofthe FBI), were on Smith’s trail. However much they suspected, though, theAmericans had no hard evidence against him. Without that or, better yet, aconfession, they could not arrest him.Crowley later claimed to have worked with Washington’s Department of Justice:“my services are contained in the records [of the DJ] to this day.”7 He laudedthe Americans as more willing “to take advantage of my help” than the Britishand asserted that they “helped me to the fullest possible extent.”8 In a passagelater expunged from Confessions, the Beast also commended the Yanks for having“brains, and they used them.”9 Asked to confirm Crowley’s connection in 1924,the new FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover replied, “I find nothing in the Bureaufiles that any information was furnished to the Department by CROWLEY during thewar, or any time subsequent thereto.”10 Indeed, there is nothing in the extantfiles for the FBI or the earlier BI to demonstrate any collaboration with theBeast.But the files alone do not tell the whole story. First, the same U.S. MilitaryIntelligence report that identified the Beast as an “employee of the BritishGovernment” shows that the Justice Department was aware of his status by 1918,possibly earlier, through the “British Counsel [sic], New York City,” which had“full cognizance” of Crowley’s activities.11 The Consul Charles Clive Bayley,who had been vice consulin Moscow during Crowley’s“Ragged Rag-time Girls”tour.12 In New York, Bayley worked very closely with Gaunt, Wiseman, and otherBritish intelligence officers in the loop about Crowley’s secret activities.Other marks of the Beast survive in American files. Crowley stated that hiscooperation with the Americans took root in a mutual interest in Viereck. Thatis confirmed by the MID summary, which notes that Crowley had been “formerlyinvestigated by the Attorney General Becker’s office in connection with theactivities of George Verick [sic] and the propaganda in New York City.”13 Beckerran a separate investigative bureau for the State of New York, which determinedthat the “British Government was fully aware of the fact that Crowley wasconnected with this German propaganda” and did not disapprove.Alfred LeRoy Becker, an active Freemason, was a deputy attorney general for theState of New York. He worked very closely with BI and other Federal agents,sharing assets and information. Hoover knew this but perhaps conveniently choseto ignore it. On the day Hoover wrote the denial above, he had received from theFBI’s New York office a report that Crowley had been “examined” at least twiceby Becker’s assistant in 1918-1919 and had “furnished certain information” abouthimself and his associations.14 Crowley noted that he had no “official” positionin the British secret service, but detailed his dealings with Gaunt. In 1919,the same Becker told a Senate investigating committee that he had personallyinterviewed Crowley and received from him examples of “German propaganda”produced by Theodor Reuss.15Crowley’s link to the Feds certainly predated his contact with Becker. In late1915, the Bureau of Investigation was still a small and decentralizedorganization. Local chiefs could employ whom they pleased how they pleasedwithout the approval or knowledge of Washington. The Mage also had Gaunt to actas middleman, and Gaunt had cultivated connections in every branch of Americanlaw enforcement. The Captain could have pointed Crowley toward the BI chief inDetroit, John Preston, who was hot on Louis Smith’s trail and anxious to grabhim. In keeping with Gaunt’s behind-the-scenes tactics, Crowley might even haveabetted Preston’s efforts without his knowledge.This brings us back to the Parke-Davis peyote deal. Coinciding with Crowley’sDetroit visit, Smith and his wife started to suffer from chronic paranoia andhallucinations. They believed that they were being watched and followed (theywere), and even thought that C.C. Crowley, or someone who looked like him, wasspying on them. Smith, driven over the edge, finally went to the police.16 Oncein custody he talked nonstop and by 28 October had confessed to his work withC.C. Crowley for Bopp. Oddly, the Feds kept all this under wraps for the nextmonth.17Could Crowley have dosed the Smiths? A key could be Mrs. Smith. She was a“masseuse,” a job which likely involved offering sexual services to certaincustomers. Crowley enjoyed that sort of thing, and it offered an opportunity tomeet and charm her, and perhaps offer something exotic to liven up her hubby’sfood—or libido. Crowley also could have used casual conversation to ferret outdetails about the Smith’s household and habits that allowed BI agents to drugthem.Whatever happened in Detroit, Crowley’s next stop was the Windy City. There hemet German-American publisher Paul Carus, “who received me royally and showed mearound the city.”18 It was no casual meeting. Carus was an important member ofMuensterberg’s propaganda gang, and Carus’ magazine Open Court had publishedCrowley’s recent panegyric upon the Kaiser, which blasted King George V as an“obscene dwarf.”19 Moreover, Carus was a good friend of Berlin’s local Consulvon Reiswitz and of Alvo von Alvensleben. Alvo maintained his main businessoffice in Chicago and was in town during or just after Crowley’s visit. Thephoto archive of the Chicago Daily News holds a picture of von Alvensleben dated6 December 1915, annotated: “Came from Vancouver, B.C. Reputed to be head ofEspionago [sic] in Chicago.”20 As usual, the Beast was keeping very interestingcompany.There could have been another covert reason for Crowley’s stop in Chicago. Infall 1915, agents of the Russian Okhrana (secret police) in New York detected aGerman plot to mobilize “anarchists” to assassinate the Tsar’s militaryrepresentatives in the United States and impede Allied war orders.21 Chicago wasthe central recruiting ground for this scheme, but its conspiratorial tentaclesreached all the way to San Francisco, the Beast’s declared destination. Oneprominent anarchist linked to the plot was the would-be assassin AlexanderBerkman, the comrade and lover of “Red Emma” Goldman.22 Berkman actuallydiscouraged collaboration with the Germans, but he was making plans for his owntrip to San Francisco, for reasons unknown.At this very time British agents in Switzerland were smashing a more grandiose“anarchist plot . . . financed from Germany, for the assassination of every oneof the heads of the Allied nations.”23 As mentioned, Crowley probably knew aboutthis through British channels, or through Reuss. This and other clues suggestthat Crowley’s westward journey and secret assignment was somehow linked to theInterdepartmental Committee on Indian Sedition formed in London almost a yearearlier. The nominal chief of the murderous cabal in Switzerland was the Indiannationalist (and later Communist) Virandranath “Chatto” Chattopadhyaya,intimately connected to the Indian Committee in Berlin and Gadar conspiracies inNorth America.24 Chatto teamed up with the Italian anarchist Luigi Bertoni, whohad his own ties to revolutionary brethren in New York, Chicago, and otherAmerican cities. Robert Nathan, a veteran of counter-subversion work in India,uncovered and foiled the Swiss plot. Nathan and Crowley may have met during theMage’s past visits to India, where Chief Commissioner Nathan was then combatingthe seditious activities of men like that dubious Bengali doctor Crowley met inChina. Thanks to Nathan, by the end of November 1915 Swiss authorities had putmore than a hundred suspects “of various nationalities” in custody.25 Soon afterNathan headed for America.Crowley finally reached Vancouver, whence Alvensleben had so recently come,about 16 October. Along the way, he initiated himself into the OTO’s 9=2 degreeand adopted a new title, To Mega Therion, “the Great Beast” or “Master Therion.”By the time he crossed into Canada, he was using his Clifford alias. Canadianrecords show no trace of him coming or going, so the subterfuge seems to haveworked. It was a wise precaution. Under the Canadian War Measures Act, TheFatherland was a banned publication, and Aleister Crowley was a knowncontributor.26 He would run into trouble if he tried to cross the border underhis real name.In Vancouver, the new Mega Therion was impressed by the local faithful,especially Jones, who had “splendidly drilled” his band of initiates.27 Heconfided to the loyal Jones that he was traveling under the name Clifford andwas only to be referred to as such. He also insisted that Lodge members stayabsolutely mum about his movements. He declined the hospitality of his followersin favor of the Hotel Vancouver, securing further privacy.All this secrecy was not just to conceal his liaison with Mrs. Foster; Jones andthe others would have been little scandalized by adultery. It is not even clearwhether the Fosters were with Crowley or had separated from him before reachingVancouver. Maybe Crowley had gotten wind of Jeanne’s double game, or he wantedto keep her out of possible trouble. The Beast also confided to Jones that hewas involved in “a matter touching on the welfare of the Empire.”28Crowley’s precautions indicate that he feared being recognized or followed, butby whom? He may have been trying to hide from German agents—he would later tellViereck and others that he was somewhere else at the time. What if Alvo had eyesand ears within the ranks of the local OTO, and what if they detected him incontact with British officials? Another risk was some overzealous Canadianofficial connecting Crowley with German propaganda and nosing around.When Crowley departed Vancouver on 21 October, Wilfred Smith jotted in his diarythat “Brother Clifford, A.E.C., Baphomet, has left Vancouver for Victoria. But Iam inclined to think somewhere else—first at least.”29 Canadian Pacific ran adirect steamer service from Vancouver to Victoria, but Crowley’s likely stop onthe way was Nanaimo, also served by a CP steamer, which lay some sixty milesnorth of Victoria, near von Alvensleben’s old stomping ground around PortAlberni. As noted, Alvensleben had loot stashed in Canada that he was anxious toretrieve. Canadian authorities were on high alert, knowing that he lurked justacross the border in Seattle. In Vancouver, wild rumors told of Alvo’sclandestine visits to the city by airplane or in drag.30 Local lawmen scouredhis rambling Kerrisdale estate overlooking the Fraser River for clues, drillinginto beautifully paneled walls after secreted documents or treasure. Alvo,though, had cleverer hiding places than his main residence.On Vancouver Island, high on scenic Malahat Mountain overlooking Victoria, wasanother grand stone house, later said to have been built by a “German prince.”If not Alvo’s, the manse belonged to one of his well-heeled Deutscher cronies.Its relative isolation made it an ideal hiding place but also complicatedrecovery. Decades later, vague rumors still floated around Victoria to theeffect that the Malahat property had been “Aleister Crowley’s house.”31 Ofcourse, the Mage never owned any house there or even visited the Island for morethan a couple of days. Still, the stories may contain a tiny but important grainof truth.Just a few miles from the Malahat mansion lay the little community of ShawniganLake, also on the rail line between Nanaimo and Victoria. Shawnigan Lake alsowas the home of Horace and Betty Bickers. Mr. Bickers was a journalist andaspiring dramatist, and, a noted, part of the local OTO scene. Crowley, recall,had determined to rekindle his romance with Betty and free her from her unworthyhusband. Betty had not accompanied her spouse to Vancouver for his recentinitiation.Maybe Crowley really did want to rescue lonely Betty, or maybe he used hissupposed passion as an excuse to go after Alvo von Alvensleben’s money. From theBickers’ home in Shawnigan Lake one could easily slip off to the “Germanprince’s” house and secure whatever was stashed inside. Crowley has virtuallynothing to say about his foray to Vancouver Island other than that it was briefand that he failed to persuade Betty to come away with him. From Victoria, heclaims, he took a boat to Seattle. Seattle immigration records show no trace ofClifford, or Crowley, or anyone remotely like him. He was as invisible leavingCanada as he was entering it.The next place the Beast can be placed with certainty is San Francisco on 5November. One of the few details he recorded about this visit was that he wasinvited to address “a semi-private gathering” soon after his arrival.32 Were theattendees drawn by interest in the OTO, or was something else on the agenda? Themost intriguing detail, however, is his lodging, the Palace Hotel—the sameestablishment used by Bopp, von Brincken, and the other German conspirators astheir base. Did Viereck tip him off to that, or Alvensleben? A larger questionis whether he revealed his presence to the Germans or watched them secretly.In San Francisco, Crowley could have provided local British operative A.Carnegie Ross with any information he had gleaned about Alvo and German funding.Ross would have passed on that to U.S. officials, including the local BI branch.As the Americans later admitted, information provided by British agents, wasabsolutely essential in making the case against Bopp and his associates.33Another man Crowley may have been looking for in San Francisco was KurtJahnke.34 Alvo, former middleman between Jahnke and the ill-fated Rintelen,could have provided the introduction, especially if he had reason to trust ourman. A big, pock-marked Prussian whose calm manner masked a cunning andmercenary mind, Jahnke was one of the greatest double, triple, or even quadrupleagents of the twentieth century. By 1915 his colorful résumé included stintswith the Chinese Customs Service (an early link to Crowley?), the U.S. MarineCorps, and smuggling everything from opium to Chinese corpses. He also foundtime to act as the lead agent in America of German naval intelligence, whichmobilized him for sabotage service at the outset of the war, making him anunofficial advisor to Bernstorff and Boy-Ed.35 Jahnke’s present cover was towork for a Bay Area private detective firm, the Morse Patrol, which gave himaccess to the docks and even American Navy facilities. Jahnke worked with,though never really under, Bopp and his crew. He had collaborated with LouisSmith and C.C. Crowley in the February 1915 destruction of a barge of Russianexplosives near Tacoma, Washington and knew all about their antics.In fact, Jahnke’s loyalty to the Kaiser was doubtful and definitely for sale. Hehad at least one other job, informer to the Americans. There are repeatedreferences to Jahnke serving in the American “Customs Service” or “SecretService” before the war, and that relationship continued in some form.36 Jahnkeseems to have had a connection with the Yanks much like that of fellow Germandouble-agent Thummel/Thorne, from the Lusitania affair. Just before Crowley’sarrival in San Francisco, and again soon after he left, Jahnke appeared in thelocal Bureau of Investigation office. His ostensible purpose was to reportsuspicious activity by German agents at the nearby Mare Island Navy Yard. Thatfacility soon was the target of sabotage, an outrage the devious Jahnke laterclaimed for himself. Other American investigators were puzzled by the failure ofthe San Francisco BI office to pounce on Jahnke before or after the fact.37 Ofcourse, since he was one of their confidential informants, that was unnecessary.The versatile Jahnke would have unhesitatingly given information to a Britishagent, especially one on good terms with the BI. Along with knowing everythingthat Bopp was up to, Jahnke had useful connections to Indian nationalist circlesand the Irish, including an “Irish Secret Lodge.”38Crowley’s presence in town also coincided with a strange act of sabotage byJahnke. In early November, Bopp ordered Jahnke to blow up a factory he believedto be secretly making munitions for the British. Bopp was mistaken; the businessmanufactured nothing more dangerous than cast-iron window sash-weights. As aresult, the furious Bopp refused to pay Jahnke the full amount for the job,something that doubtless further undermined his loyalty to the Consul.39The sash-weight fiasco was not the worst result of the Crowley curse, if such itwas, to befall Bopp and his associates. On 26 November, shortly after the Beasthad gone south, Federal agents swooped down. They first grabbed C.C. Crowley,using the information earlier extracted from the hysterical Smith, perhapssupplemented by Jahnke’s. At almost the same instant, on the other side of thecountry, Gaunt’s mouthpiece The Providence Journal ran a full exposé of Smithand C.C. Crowley’s nefarious activities and their ties to Bopp. In short order,the Americans rolled up the whole German organization. By mid-December federalindictments loomed over C.C. Crowley, von Brincken, and others. The ProvidenceJournal added more fuel to the fire by publishing double-agent van Koolbergen’sconfession, which implicated even more of the Kaiser’s officials. Indictmentsrained down on Bopp and his Kameraden into early 1916. The worst was yet tocome.The German apparatus in America was falling apart in late 1915. Britishpropaganda relentlessly kept the pressure on von Papen, Albert, and the rest ofthe East Coast leadership. On 8 December, President Wilson finally demandedBerlin’s recall of Papen and Boy-Ed, and both were gone by the beginning of theNew Year.40 The Americans grabbed head saboteur Paul Koenig ten days later. TheGermans were down, but not quite out.Interestingly two figures, Viereck and von Alvensleben, escaped unscathed. Sodid Jahnke, with his preternatural slipperiness. Again, Viereck was less likelyCrowley’s dupe than his collaborator. The Beast may have likewise corruptedAlvo. The latter was, after all, a businessman, and if the Germans could nothelp him preserve his wealth, perhaps the British could. Crowley could havebrokered a deal through which von Alvensleben quietly got back some of hismoveable wealth for helping to bring down Bopp and friends.After San Francisco, Crowley dropped out of sight for while—a smart move. He didnot go far, however; his presence or advice might be needed. His refuge wasquiet, scenic Santa Cruz, just south of the Bay Area, where he was reunited withJeanne Foster. After a round of magick couplings with Hilarion beneath theredwoods and an inspired outburst of poetic exultation, the Mage’s next knownstop was Los Angeles. He found the place teeming with “the cinema crowd ofcocaine-crazed, sexual lunatics, and the swarming maggots of near-occultists.”41Perhaps Crowley was among those who took in the spectacle of the faux BabylonD.W. Griffith had constructed for his epic Intolerance, then in production. Oneperson the Beast may have encountered during his brief stay was an aspiringactor and writer named Carl de Vidal Hundt (or Hunt). Among other things, Hundtwas a friend of Bopp’s underling von Brincken. As we will see, Crowley and Hundtwere destined to meet in a very different time and place.Leaving L.A., Crowley pushed on to San Diego where he paid a visit on the“Raja-Yoga Academy and Temple of Peace” at nearby Point Loma. This was theTheosophical Society’s American headquarters, run by Katherine Tingley. Crowleywas repelled by the place’s “nauseating atmosphere” and offended by Tingley’scurt refusal to see him. His interest in her operation may have stemmed frommore than curiosity.42 Tingley was a bitter rival of another Theosophistluminary, Annie Besant. Besant was an outspoken proponent of Indian freedom andwas suspected in London of using her movement to provide aid and comfort to“seditionists.” Crowley’s visit was an opportunity to see if any threads of the“German-Hindu Conspiracy” led to Point Loma or whether Tingley’s hostilitytoward Besant could be exploited to serve the Empire.After San Diego, Crowley’s route becomes very hazy, possibly by design. He notesonly two more stops: “Tia Juanta” [sic], Mexico, which he glowingly described asan oasis of “brothels, drinking saloons and gambling hells,” and the GrandCanyon, where he briefly stretched his alpinist’s legs. Thereafter he made hisway back to New York by “short stages,” without further details.About a hundred miles east of Tijuana, along Crowley’s route to the Canyon, layanother border town, Mexicali. It was the capital of a quasi-independent regimeunder Baja California’s governor, Col. Esteban Cantu. He supplied regularreports to the BI and other American agencies about “German activity inMexico.”43 Cantu was also a pal of Kurt Jahnke. Crowley could have expected awarm and informative reception from the Colonel. There was, after all, muchgoing on south of the border to interest him and persons in Washington andLondon. Assuming he passed through the Southwest during late November and earlyDecember, Crowley had opportunity to make personal observations along theturbulent border.The day after Christmas, the Beast surfaced in an interview in the WashingtonPost. This noted his presence in D.C. only a few days before.44 The articlepresented him as an occult scholar dedicated to reconciling science and magic,but embedded in the piece were some revealing comments about the OTO and hislabors on its behalf. Crowley said that he recently had founded “several lodges”on the Pacific Coast and that another was now “in process of formation inWashington.” He characterized the Order as a “semi-Masonic organization” that“follows Rosicrucian lines,” which makes it sound like that mysterious Germanorder with a secret chief in Berlin. The stopover in Washington also gaveCrowley a discreet opportunity to confer with Gaunt or others at the BritishEmbassy.At the end of December the Beast at last came to rest back in New York, where hetook up temporary lodging at the Harvard Club on 44th Street. Beginning onDecember 29, The Fatherland ran his two-part article “Behind the Front,”describing a recent incognito visit to France and England.45 In this he mockedBritish censorship and vividly portrayed London as battered and demoralized byzeppelin raids. In an apparent sardonic jest, he generously provided the addressof his Aunt Annie’s house in Croydon so that the German bombers might be sure tohit her in their next raid. To anyone aware of how fond he was of this woman, asFeilding and a few others undoubtedly were, this joke revealed the piece for thefakery it was. Of course, Crowley had been nowhere near London or Paris in thepreceding weeks, but might have convinced some of his German friends otherwise.In the wake of recent events on the West Coast, Crowley had reason to obscurehis presence there.In January 1916, Viereck’s International ran another article by the Mage. Thesubject was a British nurse, Edith Cavell, whom the Germans had executed inBelgium the previous August for abetting the escape of Allied POWs. This act ofapparent Hunnish brutality earned Berlin more bad press in the U.S. and elevatedthe martyred Miss Cavell to near sainthood in Britain. Crowley’s little article,provocatively titled “The Crime of Edith Cavell,” branded her a common spy,something the Germans alleged but never actually charged her with. According tothe Mage, she got what was coming to her, although he regretted that the Kaisermissed the opportunity to garner Yankee goodwill by pardoning the wretch.Recently released British documents show that Nurse Cavell really was a spy, anSIS operative no less. Was Crowley’s story a mere flight of fancy, or did heknow the truth? Did he pen the deliberately inflammatory article on Gaunt’s orHall’s secret orders in order to discredit by association the Germans’accusation of espionage?Crowley arrived back in Manhattan just a week or so after Hanns Heinz Ewers,traveling as Ernest Renfer, returned from Spain. Ewers soon was off on anothersecret mission for the Kaiser in northern Mexico, near where Crowley had beenroaming so recently. Ewers’ mission there was to convince the volatile Mexicanrebel leader Pancho Villa to turn his hostile attentions on the Americans. This,it was hoped in Berlin, would divert energy and armaments from the war inEurope. The Wilson Administration had recently bestowed de facto recognition onVilla’s rival in Mexico City, Venustiano Carranza, and cut off the guns andmoney flowing to Villa.46 Pancho was out for revenge. Ewers’ labors paid offspectacularly. In January 1916, Pancho demonstrated his displeasure by murderingsixteen (or seventeen) American miners in the Chihuahuan town of Santa Isabel.In March, he took the fight to American soil in a daring but costly raid onColumbus, New Mexico. Wilson rushed General John J. Pershing and anexpeditionary force to the border, and for the next year the U.S. and Mexicohovered on the brink of war.How much Ewers confided about his activities to friend Crowley, and how much theBeast passed on to his British superiors, we can only guess. At this time theAmerican press was full of stories about German intrigues to sow conflictbetween the U.S. and Mexico. Unsurprisingly, Gaunt and Hall were the source ofmany of these revelations.47Another German agent working on Villa and well-known to Ewers was ArnoldoKrumm-Heller (a.k.a. Arnold Krumm).48 A one-time Theosophist, esotericfreemason, and founder of his own Rosicrucian order, Fraternitas RosicrucianaAntiqua (FRA), Krumm had been a pupil of both Theodor Reuss and Don Jesus deMedina. There is no evidence that Crowley and Krumm met at this time, which isnot to say that they were unaware of each other. Krumm was one of Berlin’s mostimportant agents in the pro-German Carranza’s entourage. A grateful Presidentemade Krumm an honorary lieutenant colonel on his general staff.49 In addition,in early 1916 Carranza appointed Krumm military attaché to Berlin. That spring,on his way to the Reich, Krumm stopped near New York, waiting to catch a Danishsteamer. He kept a low profile and traveled under the alias Dr. von Carey.Ewers, however, knew of his presence, something he easily might have let slip toCrowley. Somehow American and British authorities got wind of Krumm’s visit anddestination.Soon after, at the Scottish port of Kirkwall, where Krumm’s ship stopped forblockade inspection, British authorities grabbed him. Scotland Yard chief BasilThomson recalls the episode in his memoirs, including Krumm’s odd behavior.Although the German insisted that he was a Mexican citizen and the emissary of aneutral country, Thomson knew that his real mission was “propaganda.” Moreover,Thomson knew that Krumm was carrying a secret letter from von Bernstorff toBerlin. When Krumm’s protests fell on deaf ears, he offered to cut a deal byrevealing “a new German plan and would thus save the Allies thousands oflives.”50 Could this have been Crowley’s “turncoat spell” at work again? In theend, according to Thomson, Krumm had nothing to offer, and the British put himon the next boat back to Mexico.Another character who drew the attention of the entire British apparatus in NewYork in January 1916 was the troublesome I.T. Trebitsch-Lincoln, who escapedAmerican custody. To say the British were angered and dismayed by thisdevelopment is an understatement. Although a U.S. court had approved hisextradition to England the preceding fall, the wily Trebitsch delayed hisdeparture by ingratiating himself with his American captors. He convinced thehead of the Bureau of Investigation in Gotham, William Offley, that he couldbreak German codes and help uncover Berlin’s intrigues, including the passportfraud case that involved Viereck and Ewers.51 If nothing else, this suggeststhat Offley would have gladly accepted a like overture from Crowley, with orwithout the British Consul’s or Washington’s approval. Trebitsch similarlysolicited the British, but Consul Bayley quickly determined that he was fakinghis expertise. Frustrated and alarmed, Bayley and others would have welcomed theapplication of the Beast’s special talents in the effort to recapture thefugitive.The Americans proved gullible, in several ways. Trebitsch got out of lockupregularly to “work” at the nearby federal building and even wangled eveningfurloughs for dining, drinking, and skirt-chasing. He so beguiled the federalmarshal assigned to watch him that one evening he simply walked away. Trebitschremained a free man for thirty-five days before being caught casually strollingdown Broadway by BI agents. He was planning to board a ship to the Far East aday or so later. The Bureau’s success was not blind luck: they had been tippedoff to Trebitsch’s whereabouts and new appearance by unnamed informants whoincluded “naturalized citizens of German birth.”52 That could have includedViereck and behind him, Crowley.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 CAC, 767.2 WWP, 6/161, Granville Barker to Wiseman, 20 Nov. 1916.3 Martin A.

"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHT [../Text/contents.html] 020 [../Images/00002.jpg] SHIFTING SANDS021 [../Images/00002.jpg] WHILE CROWLEY WAS AWAY FROM NEW YORK, the British intelligence array in NorthAmerica was changing. Shortly before the Beast arrived in San Francisco, twoBritish businessmen disembarked in New York. Forty-four-year-old SydneyMansfield and thirty-year-old Sir William Wiseman were really intelligenceofficers dispatched from London. Mansfield had been hand-picked by LordKitchener, and Wiseman by Commander Mansfield Cumming, chief of the SecretIntelligence Service (SIS), then operating as MI1c.Gaunt was not at all happy to see them. The Captain mobilized the support of hisfriends at Morgan & Co. to resist the unwanted intrusion of the “secret service”into “our organization” and even sought the intervention of AmbassadorSpring-Rice.1 Gaunt later gloated that he quickly sent the “gumshoe merchants”packing back to England.2 He had won the skirmish, but he already hadunwittingly lost the war.The appearance of Mansfield and Wiseman indicated growing concerns in London.Gaunt’s role as spymaster was, after all, not part of the legitimate duties of anaval attaché, all the more because it was general knowledge to the enemy andmost everyone else. His overextension threatened to compromise him and hisgovernment just as von Papen and Boy-Ed had done.3 The second concern related toGaunt’s handling of expenses, especially those related to Morgan’s protection ofmunitions ships. Gaunt had persuaded the Morgan-contracted Dougherty DetectiveAgency to reduce some of its exorbitant charges, all billable to His Majesty,but overcharging and outright fraud were still rampant.4 Unsurprisingly, neitherthe Captain nor 23 Wall Street welcomed outsiders poking their noses into thematter.In January 1916, Wiseman returned to Manhattan and, with the full backing ofCumming and the Foreign Office, set up what he termed “MI1c, Section V” in theConsulate at 44 Whitehall Street. His broad mandate included “Contre-Espionage”and the investigation of Irish and “Hindu” sedition in the U.S.5 It also came toinclude a good deal of propaganda activity and even more secretive and sensitiveblack ops.A hereditary baronet (which also stuck in Gaunt’s craw), Wiseman was a banker byprofession. More recently he was an Army captain wounded in Flanders, which lefthim with impaired eyesight and led to his reassignment to intelligence work. Incontrast to the big, brash, and flamboyant Gaunt, Wiseman was a small, plump,soft-spoken, and scrupulously polite young fellow whose pencil mustachestruggled to give gravitas to a round baby face. His disarming appearancedisguised a subtle and cunning mind, much abler than Gaunt’s for spy work. Gauntinsisted later that Wiseman did nothing but “play a very small part under me,”but the reality was something else entirely.6 Slowly but inexorably, Gaunt wasmarginalized and finally wholly displaced by Wiseman’s operation.Wiseman’s job required him to wear a number of hats, all kept neatlycompartmentalized as befitted a master conspirator. While he continued Gaunt’spolicy of close cooperation with the Americans, he confided to London that theYanks had never known “the details and extent of our organization” and neverwould.7 He also organized a separate “political and Secret Service organization”that he ran all by himself.8 This doubtless was connected to Wiseman’s mostconfidential mission, as an agent of influence on the Wilson Administration withthe aim of bringing the U.S. into the war.9 That certainly gave him something incommon with Crowley, who had labored in the same vineyard for some time.Something else that Wiseman and the Beast would come to share was a postwarcharge of treason.10Two more experienced operatives arrived in early 1916 to support Wiseman. MajorNorman Graham Thwaites, an ex-journalist who became Wiseman’s right-hand man,had many old acquaintances in New York, such as Crowley’s friend Cosgrave. Theother man was Robert Nathan, the veteran Indian Civil Service officer whorecently had been battling assassination plots in Switzerland.11Interestingly, the only known SIS document about Crowley to see light of day isa brief report from “Contre-Espionage, New York” (Wiseman’s outfit) dated 8March 1916 that somehow ended up in a French intelligence file.12 It looks likea response to a query from London, and indicates copies sent to NID, MilitaryIntelligence, and MI5. The document is little more than a summary of articlesabout Crowley that had appeared in the American press, including the World pieceof December 1914. Most attention focuses on the New York Times coverage of hisperformance at the Statue of Liberty and his membership in the supposed Irish“Secret Revolutionary Committee.” Based on this, the report identifies Crowleyas “an Irish agitator” but makes no reference to his many German connections nordoes it make any definite statement regarding his loyalty. This contraststellingly with notices sent out by MI5 about the same time unequivocallyidentifying our man as a “pro-German propagandist” and “degenerate Irishjournalist” who was to be “searched and sent [to] Metropolitan Police, London”if apprehended in a British port.13 Thus, Wiseman or Thwaites acknowledgednothing that was not already public record. The report indicates no interest ininvestigating Crowley further.Wiseman and Thwaites behaved precisely the same way toward another doubtfulcharacter and British operative running around wartime New York—Sidney Reilly.Reilly’s and Crowley’s paths had crossed before, from Victorian London to prewarRussia, though whether they had met is unknown. Nevertheless, both ended up inthe service of British intelligence. Reilly arrived in the States in January1915 in the guise of a war contractor for the Russian Government. In New York,he insinuated himself into the affairs of the corrupt and spy-infested RussianSupply Committee, turning his influence there into a small fortune. At the sametime, like Crowley, he assiduously cultivated contacts with the Germans,including those involved in propaganda and sabotage.14Norman Thwaites later devoted a whole chapter to Reilly in his memoirs, in whichhe praised Reilly’s “valuable services” to British intelligence.15 Nevertheless,Thwaites—and Wiseman—spun a very different story to American investigatorsduring the war, denouncing him as probably an enemy agent. They deliberatelywithheld information about him and his activities from MI5. This is an exampleof one intelligence section concealing its assets from an allied agency. Thesame standard operating procedure was used to obscure Crowley’s roles.Gaunt, as might be expected, was never so clever or discreet. In 1917, hoping toembarrass and compromise Wiseman, he denounced Reilly to the Americans as anenemy agent.16 Gaunt could not make a similar fuss about Crowley, because thatwould implicate him as well. The Mage’s name did come up during Gaunt’s visit toLondon in November 1916. On that visit, he had his “long talk” about Crowleywith Scotland Yard chief Basil Thomson. Gaunt later recounted the incident toJohn Symonds, to whom he also supposedly characterized Crowley as a “small timetraitor.” Gaunt told Symonds he “preached” to Thomson to “Let [Crowley] alone, Ihave a complete line on him and also The Fatherland.”17 Why would Gaunt havethought it necessary to intercede on behalf of a traitor, even a petty one? Morelikely, what he really told Thomson was that he had a complete line on TheFatherland through Crowley. Gaunt simply interceded to protect a useful asset.Gaunt’s postwar recollections about Crowley may have been tainted by lingeringbitterness toward Viereck and Wiseman. In a 1929 article in the Saturday EveningPost, Viereck accurately portrayed Wiseman as the real brains of Britishintelligence in wartime America and included a rather uncomplimentary portrayalof the jaunty Australian.18 This insult must have stung all the more if, assurmised, Viereck also had been one of Gaunt’s informants. Gaunt seethed aboutViereck’s “gross libel” for the rest of his life, and it fed his vendettaagainst Wiseman. Gaunt raged that he knew enough about Viereck “to hang him” butinsisted that he had “arranged” with Admiral Hall to leave him alone because itwas “better [to] have a devil one knows all about than perchance get a strangerone knew nothing of.”19 Crowley could have convinced him of that. If so, Gauntmay have thought the Beast an accomplice in Viereck’s libel. In Gaunt’s mind,which appears to have become a bit unstable in his declining years, maybeCrowley really did become a “traitor”—to him.Basically, Crowley came back to New York to find British intelligence under newmanagement. Like any employee in that situation, he had to wonder where thatleft him. One effect was probably financial: Crowley was on a leaner budgetafter his return and would remain so for some time. Of course, that may havebeen his fault. Never one to travel on the cheap, he likely spent every penny hehad received. That left him with what Viereck paid him plus money from freelancewriting. Wiseman, who knew a thing or two about finances, kept a tight rein onaccounts. Plus, there may have been some questions about just what Crowley didin Canada and whether he had thereby enriched himself. Wiseman and his Section Vroutinely shared information with “Canadian Police and Military authorities.”20Perhaps this is why Crowley later complained that because the Germans paid him,“the British Government decided to pay me less.”21Wiseman had no personal experience with Crowley and good reasons to regard himwith caution. To exacerbate the uncertainty, Crowley’s old ally and controller,Feilding, left London and NID for the Eastern Mediterranean Special IntelligenceBureau (EMSIB) in January 1916.22 Because of Wiseman’s paramount politicalduties, the day-to-day operation of Section V more and more fell into the handsof Norman Thwaites, a man more likely than Wiseman to have viewed Crowley withfavor, or at least curiosity. For one thing, Thwaites took a keen interest inthe paranormal and the occult. He was familiar with, and possibly a member of,Feilding’s Society for Psychical Research. Moreover, the EMSIB, to whichFeilding now belonged, was the Middle Eastern branch of SIS. This commonconnection explains Feilding’s ability to maintain contact with the Beast whilestationed in the Near East.In his memoirs, Thwaites recounts a peculiar episode in which he and some NewYork friends used a Ouija board and a medium to ferret out a German-Indian plotinvolving stolen passports.23 It is quite possible that the Beast played a partin the case. About this time the Mage took a new interest in the oracular board.Thwaites further mentions that he had an agent, “#27,” with contacts inside theGerman Consulate, who presented his boss with a copy of a German surveillancereport detailing Thwaites’ own movements.24Crowley’s return to New York coincided with the arrival of another traveler fromabroad, Paul Marie Bolo Pasha. Like the Mage, Bolo had been lurking inSwitzerland when the war started. In the interim, he had become the personalagent of the exiled Khedive of Egypt, hence his “Pasha” title. Bolo also becamea willing tool of the Germans and the point man in a scheme to sow defeatism inthe French press. That connected him to a corrupt French politician, JosephCaillaux.25 The plan called for the German funds to be laundered through theGuaranty Trust Company in New York with help from one of its employees, JacquesMinotto.26 Minotto was friends with von Bernstorff, Dernburg, Viereck, and mostof the rest of the New York German crowd. He also had ties to Chicago, which,along with his banking expertise, suggests a link to von Alvensleben. Once more,Crowley was well-placed to discover some secrets. French authorities got wind ofthe plot, arrested Bolo Pasha in fall 1917, and shot him the following April.About the same time, the Bureau of Investigation arrested Minotto as a Germanagent.One thing that did not long survive the Beast’s return to New York, if it madeit that far, was his romance with Jeanne Foster. He seems to have taken her“betrayal” hard, but wasted no time finding solace elsewhere. There was stillloyal Leila, of course, but during April Crowley began simultaneous affairs withtwo other women. In both cases more was involved than sex and magick.27The first was Gerda Maria von Kothek, identified as a German prostitute and the“brilliant young angel of Revolution.”28 Her real name was Gerda Schumann andshe was around nineteen when she met the Beast. Not long after, possibly evenbefore, Gerda married another German immigrant. Dr. Rudolf Gebauer, and the pairtook up residence in Passaic, New Jersey. A chemist employed at a nearby plant,Gebauer shared his wife’s radical sympathies, but he had other interestingconnections. First, he had ties the main German radical organ in Manhattan, theNew Yorker Volkszeitung, run by veteran socialist Ludwig Lore. Clandestinethreads tied Lore’s anti-war publication to the Propaganda Kabinett and GermanConsulate.The Bureau of Investigation took an interest in Gebauer in April 1917. Anunnamed source claimed that he was in league with von Bernsdorff, von Papen,Koenig and other German plotters, but a brief investigation turned up notangible evidence.29 Might Crowley have provided such information in the hope ofgetting the good doctor out of the way? One more thing that could have attractedthe Mage’s attention was Gebauer’s membership in the German University League. Aleading member of the same body was Hugo Muensterberg. Berlin’s agentscultivated radicals not just as assassins, but also as saboteurs, instigators ofplant and dock strikes and anti-war agitators. A chemist could have all mannerof uses. As Gerda’s lover, Crowley had yet another means to monitor suchintrigues.Gerda may be the same “German prostitute” linked to the second new woman inCrowley’s life, Alice Coomaraswamy, better known by her stage name, Ratan Devi.The Yorkshire-born Devi, who “possessed a strange seductive beauty and charm,”had mastered the intricacies of Indian singing and was the wife of theAnglo-Indian critic and writer Ananda Coomaraswamy.30 The pair landed in NewYork not long after Crowley returned from his travels. Coomaraswamy, accordingto Crowley, shared his interest in “Asiatic religion and Magic,” but it was Deviwho fell madly in love with the Beast.31Unsurprisingly, Crowley later voiced contempt for the man he cuckolded. Heexpressed special disgust with Coomaraswamy’s creation of a ménage à trois whichcompelled his wife to share a bed with the “German prostitute” he had takenin.32 There was more to this than sex. The two women swapped confidences aboutCoomaraswamy, and both would have been willing to share the same with the Mage,especially if they both were sleeping with him, too. By seducing Coomaraswamy’swife and planting another girlfriend in his bed, Crowley could keep tabs oneverything Coomaraswamy did and everyone he met. The Beast had his reasons.Crowley’s animus toward Coomaraswamy went beyond jealousy or contempt for a cad.He ultimately declared the Eurasian nothing less than a “Black Brother,” i.e. amember of the sinister Black Brotherhood, adept of the dark arts and a servitorof the German cause.33 Coomaraswamy definitely had Indian nationalist sympathiesand consorted with that circle in New York. His Indian associates includedSailandranath Gose, the man Wiseman later stood accused of conniving with. Fromthe British standpoint, Coomaraswamy wanted careful, discreet watching.The man who would have been most interested in anything Crowley obtained fromCoomaraswamy was Robert Nathan. In May 1916, Nathan embarked on his owncross-country trip that closely followed Crowley’s earlier route. He headed toVancouver and then to San Francisco, where he revitalized and expanded thecovert campaign against the Indians, Irish, and Germans with the willingcooperation of local authorities. Among Nathan’s informants in New York was oneknown simply as “C” who did much to illuminate the doings of theIndo-Irish-German nexus. 34 One theory pegs “C” as Chandra Chakravarty, anothernationalist who enjoyed the confidence of German officials.35 However, given theconnections noted above, it is just as possible that “C” stood for Crowley.In the meantime, American authorities, egged on and assisted by British agents,kept up the hunt for German plotters and saboteurs. A leader in this campaignwas Inspector Thomas Tunney, chief of the NYPD’s crack Bomb Squad. He also wasan old pal of Thwaites, who later praised Tunney as a man who “has been of greatservice to the British Authorities here.”36 On 10 April 1916, Tunney’s menarrested Karl von Kleist, who was mixed up with a New Jersey bomb factory run byanother German, Dr. Walter Scheele. Its explosive devices reached German agentsas far away as New Orleans. Tunney’s men managed this coup by convincing vonKleist that they were working for yet another of Berlin’s operatives, Wolf vonIgel, Papen’s former secretary.37Kleist ended up betraying Scheele, and his confession had a familiar twist; heclaimed that the Americans had drugged him—perhaps Crowley had come to therescue with a dose of tongue-loosening peyote.Meanwhile a much bigger game was afoot in New York and off the stormy west costof Ireland. Breaking Kleist helped Tunney close in on von Igel, whom theAmericans nabbed on 18 April. A search of von Igel’s office turned updocumentation of a conspiracy linking John Devoy and Clan-na-Gael withcompatriots in Dublin and Roger Casement in Berlin. Their aim was an Irishinsurrection that the Germans had pledged to support with guns and ammunition.38Included in Igel’s papers was a cipher message mentioning a shipment of Germanarms already on its way. On 21 April, British naval forces intercepted theNorwegian merchant ship SS Aud Norge off the Irish coast. The Aud, in reality adisguised German vessel, was carrying 20,000 rifles, ten machine guns, andmillions of rounds of ammunition intended for the doomed uprising later known asthe Easter Rebellion (24 April-1 May).39 The Aud’s nervous skipper scuttled theship and surrendered with his crew. For the Irish rebels the disaster wascompounded by the almost simultaneous capture of Casement, who had arrived byU-boat on a beach near Tralee.Devoy blamed the Americans for the fiasco, because they revealed his ciphermessage to the British. This caused some concern and head-scratching inWashington. State Department intelligence insisted that the Aud was undone by“the British Naval Intelligence Service” with no official help from U.S.authorities.40 It did appear, however, that “the information was given probablyinformally by American secret agents to the British Service.”41 Another documentpointed to unnamed “Justice’s agents” as the most likely to have beeninvolved.42 In reality, the British picked up information about the EasterConspiracy from a variety of places, but New York was one. With his connectionsto the BI and British intelligence (especially NID), Crowley would have been areliable and deniable conduit for passing information between them.The Beast certainly followed these Irish events and tried to exploit them forpropagandistic effect. On 12 May 1916, the Washington Post ran a letter from himin which he claimed that his earlier declaration of Irish independence had beenthe inspiration for the recent uprising.43 “I begat the Irish republic on GreatMother Time,” he wrote, “in due course the first born has come to light.” Hewent on to urge all true Irishmen to forgive England for its sins and for bothnations to approach each other in a spirit of equality and reconciliation. Ofcourse, unless London granted independence, he also predicted further bloodshed.It is even possible that Crowley played a subtle role in sealing the fate ofRoger Casement, who stood trial for treason on 26 June 1916 in London. The courthanded down a verdict of guilty three days later. Casement’s treason was not inquestion; the only issue was whether or not he would hang for it. He was still ahighly respected figure, and many voices called for clemency, among them JohnQuinn’s. However, the release of the “Black Diaries,” which vividly detailedCasement’s homosexual promiscuity, silenced most of these pleas. He died on thegallows at Pentonville Prison on 3 August.Interestingly, Gaunt’s name crops up in connection to the “leaking of theCasement homosexuality scandal.”44 There were, and still are, questions aboutthe authenticity of the incriminating diaries. Gaunt’s task was to dredge upsupporting evidence from Casement’s time in New York. Since Quinn dismissed thehomosexuality charge, who would have been better suited to collect or concoctsuch dirt than Crowley?Crowley records that “during this time [spring 1916], I was often away inWashington.”45 As usual, he offers no particular reason why, but he was not shyabout advertising his presence in the American capital. On 30 April (Beltane),the Washington Post ran a short article by him commenting on a recentsensational murder case involving New York dentist Dr. Arthur Warren Waite (norelation to A.E. Waite of the Golden Dawn).46 Waite had killed his in-laws andtried to kill his wife with arsenic and germ cultures. Crowley’s comments werereserved for Waite’s claim to have been driven to the deed by demonic forces,something the Mage considered entirely possible.Next, on 26 May, the Beast appeared at D.C.’s National Press Club, where he losta series of games against chess whiz Norman Tweed Whitaker.47 The real purposeof Crowley’s trip to the capital was his affair with “Stuart X.” This was thepseudonym of Henry Clifford Stuart, an eccentric economist who hired Crowley tointroduce and edit his rambling essays on politics and culture into aself-published book titled A Prophet in His Own Country.48 This book,incidentally, was censored by Canadian (but not British) authorities because ofCrowley’s involvement.Outwardly, the Beast’s participation in the project was a purely mercenaryarrangement, perhaps an act of financial desperation, but this does not rule outother angles. Stuart intended the book as propaganda for his challenge toWoodrow Wilson in the upcoming presidential election. That made Stuart apotentially useful tool for German propagandists, such as Crowley ostensiblywas. Moreover, Stuart was familiar with at least two passionately pro-Germanmembers of the American literati, Theodore Dreiser and the “Sage of Baltimore,”H.L. Mencken, both of whom also knew Crowley.49 If nothing else, this explainshow Crowley and Stuart met.The arrangement with Stuart gave Crowley a legitimate reason to visit D.C. andan opportunity to learn about the region’s Germanophile nexus. That could havebeen very valuable from the intelligence perspective. Expulsions and arrests hadshattered the German secret apparatus in New York, and the East Coast center hadshifted to Baltimore and the ring run by Thummel’s old friend, Frederich Hinsch.In fact, Hinsch and his comrades were now involved in a disturbing escalation ofthe sabotage campaign.In the quiet Washington suburb of Chevy Chase, only five miles from Stuart’shome, German agents were hard at work making biological weapons. The head ofthis diabolical enterprise was a thirty-one-year-old American-born physician,Anton Dilger. Raised and mostly educated in Germany, Dilger had volunteered forthe Kaiser’s army in 1914 but was mustered out after suffering some physical ormental breakdown. Still, he was determined to aid Germany’s cause. Dilger hadmade a detailed study of Bacillus anthracis, better known as anthrax, andrelated pathogens. In October 1915, he returned to the U.S. (using his Americanpassport) with cultures of anthrax and glanders. With the help of his brotherCarl, he set about mass-producing the organisms in a home lab. He then supplieddisease-laden vials to Hinsch’s operatives in Baltimore and elsewhere to infecthorses and other animals being shipped to Allied countries.50Dilger’s activities may throw light on Crowley’s sudden interest in the similarmethodology of Dr. Waite. Rumors of Dilger’s operation had leaked out by thespring of 1916, possibly via Ewers, who knew Dilger through connections in Spainand Mexico. Spurred by clues from Ewers, Crowley’s visits to D.C. may have aimedto sniff out Dilger’s lab. Perhaps he thought the Waite article would smoke outsome information. If so, he failed, because Dilger’s germ factory continued tocrank out pathogens until he returned to Germany in the coming autumn.Crowley also made a quick trip in mid-May 1916 to Philadelphia, where he hadbriefly stayed a year before. This was to visit another old acquaintance fromEngland, novelist Louis Wilkinson, husband of the American poet Frances Gregg.Wilkinson shared an interest in magic and was one of a few who remained a friendof the Beast to the end. Wilkinson had no evident connection to intelligencematters, but Crowley arrived in the City of Brotherly Love the day afterHinsch’s men destroyed the Dupont munitions plant in nearby Gibbstown, NJ.Frances Gregg did not share her husband’s enthusiasm for Crowley. In fact, shefeared and loathed him as a kind of evil spirit who haunted her for the rest ofher life. She later confided to her son, Oliver Wilkinson, a disturbing incidentduring the war. Walking into a room of her home that she had every expectationof finding empty, Frances was shocked to find “a bald man at the table.”51 Asshe watched, “the man put on his hair, and turned into Crowley.” She claimedthat Crowley carried a case full of wigs. Gregg also was disturbed by hispeculiar efforts to hide himself, or literally make himself invisible, inrestaurants and other public places. These weird incidents convinced Mrs.Wilkinson that her husband’s friend was some sort of “master criminal” involvedin sinister conspiracies. The Beast tried to convince Wilkinson that his wifewas crazy, and Gregg probably was overly imaginative. Along with her instinctivedislike of the man, however, another explanation may be that she had encounteredand misread aspects of Crowley’s clandestine work. He had always enjoyeddisguises, and they would have been useful in undercover duties. Something Greggmay not have appreciated was that her husband could have been a willingaccessory to such activity.Crowley made another short trip at the end of April to Bronxville, a quietHudson Valley town just north of Manhattan. It, too, was close to New Rochelle,which he had visited months before. This somehow connected to his relations withWinslow Plummer and the Rosicrucians. Maybe it involved the secretcommunications with the Berlin head of their “German order.” Crowley later toldAttorney General Becker that Reuss had paid a secret visit to the Bronx. Did hemean Bronxville? The Beast also said that he had reported this to officials ofthe Bureau.It was through Plummer that Crowley met Henry Christopher Watts. The Welsh-bornWatts was secretary of another esoteric religious order, the Society ofAtonement, which was based further up the Hudson in Garrison, New York. Theavowed goal of the Society was the reunion of the Anglican Church with Rome.52That was identical to the aspirations of some of the Jacobites Crowley hadassociated with back in the 1890s. Watts, however, had another job, as agent forLondon’s Department of Information, later the Ministry of Information. This wasrun by John Buchan, the same man to whom NID operative Gerald Kelly reported.British archives once contained four files on Watts and his activities. LikeCrowley’s, all have vanished. From the few traces remaining, Watts worked as apropagandist feeding articles to Catholic papers in the U.S., as a counter toGerman and Fenian influence. A 3 November 1917 letter from Watts to the ForeignOffice shows that he was familiar with Crowley and his associates. In it Wattslinked John Devoy, Frank Harris, and Viereck to each other and to Crowley, andall to German propaganda. He called our man a “renegade Englishman . . . , amystic and Rosicrucian,” who of late had taken a strange interest in becoming aRoman Catholic.53 In pursuit of that goal, seemingly an odd one for the Beast,Crowley used one of his women (Leila? Gerda?) to approach a “well-known Catholicpoet” at the New York Times, apparently without result. Watts was certain thatFrank Harris was in the thick of whatever was going on. Crowley’s Roman gambitmay have been connected to a recent Papal peace initiative and resulting effortsby Germany and the Allies to exploit it to their advantage.54 The Vatican’sactions threatened to affect Catholic opinion in the U.S., not least among theIrish. Watts is another fine example of one British agent not recognizinganother, perhaps just as it was meant to be.Another recent arrival from Europe must have piqued Crowley’s interest. She was“Baroness” Ida Leonie von Seidlitz, a longtime Berlin operative who had mostrecently tried her hand in lobbying members of the Tsar’s Government to seek aseparate peace. In spring 1916, she ran a neat little operation out of her roomsat the Waldorf-Astoria. She recruited a stable of attractive young women whomshe maneuvered into relationships with targeted men. One of her protégées wasthe Russian ballerina Tamara Svirskaya, who ended up the bedmate of the localRussian Consul General, Dmitrii Florinskii.55 Yet another intimate of theBaroness was Rozika Schwimmer, the Hungarian-Jewish pacifist (and reputedAustrian agent) who had persuaded Henry Ford to mount his abortive “Peace Ship”effort in late 1915.56British intelligence soon caught on to the Baroness’ game, and someone keptGaunt and Thwaites up to date on her intrigues.57 Von Seidlitz dabbled in Irishplots and maintained a secret line of communication to Ambassador von Bernstorffthrough the avant-garde French composer Edgard Varese.58 Varese and the Baronessboth had a strong interest in the occult, which afforded the Mage a means toinfiltrate their circle. An “ardent Theosophist,” von Seidlitz claimed psychicpowers and reigned as high priestess over séances and like mystical gatherings.Wittingly or not, Frank Harris played a part in Crowley’s ongoing penetration ofthe German secret apparatus. Back in summer 1915 Ambassador Spring-Rice hadforwarded to London an anonymous letter (likely from Watts) that blasted Crowleyand Harris as dangerous “German agents.”59 By 1916, as editor of Pearson’sMagazine, Harris polished that reputation with a steady stream of anti-war,anti-Allied articles.Through Harris, Crowley reunited with another old fellow student of the occult,George Raffalovitch, whom Harris gave a cover job on his magazine. A onetimecontributor to The Equinox and member of Crowley’s elect A∴A∴, Raffalovitch hadparted ways with the Beast over the prewar Rites of Eleusis flap. Raffalovitch,born in France and a naturalized British subject, came from a distinguishedRussian-Jewish family. He was a nephew of Arthur Raffalovitch, the longtime“financial agent” of the Tsarist Government in France and a confidant of theRothschilds. Shortly before the war, George R. embraced Ukrainian nationalismand came to head a “Ukrainian Committee” in London. The catalog of old ForeignOffice correspondence reveals that the British had a dossier on Raffalovitch c.1916, but it, too, was “not preserved.”After 1914, Raffalovitch’s nationalism led him to the Germans, who offeredsupport to Ukrainian nationalists as they did to the Irish and Indian.Raffalovitch’s subsequent appearance in New York was to rallyUkrainian-Americans to the cause, though he denied that Berlin was behind this.Raffalovitch claimed to be a secret agent for mysterious persons inside Russia,probably anti-Tsarist groups. He may also have been a double agent for Russianintelligence. Whatever the case, he afforded Crowley further access tointrigue-infested Russian circles in New York, from Baroness Seidlitz’s occultsalon to revolutionary cells plotting in Greenwich Village basements.Raffalovitch had yet another role. According to the Bureau of Investigation, hewas “paymaster of German agents” in New York, dispersing some $18,000 eachmonth.60 The source of this information was an informant dubbed “A-139,” “whoappear[ed] to have a private connection to the British Consulate.”61 A-139 wasvery well-informed about Raffalovitch’s past activities in Britain. A furtherclue is A-139’s contact at the Consulate: Royal Navy Lt. Henry Fitzroy. Fitzroyshowed up at 44 Whitehall in July 1916 and took over “military control” andpassport duties. His secret responsibilities included counterespionage and“tracking enemy agents.”62 Technically, he was Gaunt’s subordinate, but Thwaitesand Wiseman also claimed him, and he reported to both.63 Fitzroy is the manwould have handled routine liaison with Agent Crowley.In early 1916 Crowley met Evangeline Adams, astrologer to the rich and famous.She was taken with him, for a while at least, and engaged him to ghost-write atome on astrology. Crowley and Adams encountered one another at a soirée hostedby the now familiar World editor John Cosgrave, another helpmate of Britishpropaganda. Cosgrave too was a friend of Norman Thwaites, who may have been atthe same gathering. In any case, the Beast’s presence at Cosgrave’s table showsthat their relationship continued, a strange association for a supposedpro-German propagandist and a pro-Allied editor.In the end, Adams never paid Crowley for his work, but she did put him up.Crowley had moved again, to Broadway and 52nd Street, but Adams offered him theuse of her cabin on the shores of New Hampshire’s scenic Lake Pasquaney(Newfound Lake today). He was settled in there by mid-June and would spend thesummer enjoying a “magical retirement” in this bucolic setting far from themadding crowds and intrigues of New York—most of them, anyway. He craved restand seems to have been undergoing a genuine personal crisis. The Beast hoped torenew and strengthen his connections with spiritual forces and vowed to stopdegrading himself “by working at anything whatever.”64 He put his labors forStuart X, Vanity Fair, and even Adams in that despised category. More stressdoubtless stemmed from his double life on the undercover front. At the Lake, hedevoted himself to meditation, writing, and the ritual crucifixion of theoccasional toad, fueling his visions with abundant use of mescaline and ether.Keeping body and soul together was far cheaper in the New Hampshire woods thanin Manhattan. The move even let him wriggle out of his relationship with the nowpregnant and increasingly clinging Ratan Devi.This does not mean that he entirely abandoned intelligence work. In the courseof the summer, Crowley found opportunities to visit Boston, only a few hoursaway by train. His diary records trysts with a French-Canadian prostitute and acouple of anonymous homosexual encounters all, apparently, connected to magickoperations. But he cannot have overlooked the fact that Cambridge was the homeof his nemesis, Dr. Muensterberg, who was still fully engaged in his pro-Germanmachinations. A rustic hideaway with easy access to Boston afforded Crowleyideal means to keep an eye on the Professor’s activities.It was during his Pasquaney idyll that Crowley formulated ideas for a cycle ofstories featuring his Sherlock Holmes-esque sleuth, Simon Iff, genius atdeduction and master magician. As with most of his fiction, Crowley basedcharacters and plot elements on real persons and events. Three of these Ifftales merit special attention, because they derived at least part of theirinspiration from the author’s clandestine escapades.The most important is “The Natural Thing to Do,” which has Simon Iff and hisplucky Watson figure, Dolores Cass, battling a gang of German conspirators benton crippling America’s shipping industry and “cut off England from Americansupplies.”65 Iff admits, “I’m here on a special mission for the BritishAdmiralty,” and in one episode ponders:> Wouldn’t everybody be surprised if they knew just what the British Government> had sent him to do in America? If they knew what was in a certain paper at the> bank, a casus belli, no less? But with whom? Aha—there was the secret! And> wouldn’t everybody be amazed if they knew just what he knew about a certain> subject that he wouldn’t mention, not he?Was this a veiled reference to the Lusitania or some other secret? In the end,Iff distracts his enemy by revealing “a dozen secrets, any one of them enough toshake the world.” Among the story’s characters, “my good friend Lascelles, ofthe Royal Navy,” fits Gaunt or Fitzroy; the American “Commissioner Teake, headof the New York Police,” is Tunney, and “Col. Blagden” of the Secret Servicestands in for Frank Burke. On the other side, allied with the Germans is one“Berkeley,” a disgraced English gentleman turned enemy spy. One must wonder ifhe, too, had his counterpart in the real world. The mastermind of the Germanvillains, “Prince Joachim von Ararberg, . . . a mathematician of the highestrank, a physiologist of extraordinary distinction . . . who had become aspecialist in psychotherapeutics,” can only be Muensterberg.On 16 December 1916, Hugo Muensterberg, age fifty-three, dropped dead whilelecturing to a class at Radcliffe, then Harvard’s “women’s annex.” The Germancause lost its “Moriarty.” Family and friends were stunned by his unexpectedpassing, but Muensterberg had been under much strain. Crowley was far, far awayin New Orleans, a journey we will look at more closely in the next chapter. Didhe invoke a voodoo curse from the sanctuary of the bayous?The answer may be more mundane. Hints can be found in the two other Simon Iffstories. In “A Sense of Incongruity,” Iff is up against another nefarious plot,a Japanese one to surreptitiously poison prominent politicos. Written rightafter Muensterberg’s death, the story may indicate what was on Crowley’s mind.More revealingly, in “The Pasquaney Puzzle,” the Magician’s young partner indetection, Dolores Cass, first appears as a Radcliffe student and pupil of theoccult who mystifies her family with a clever Doppelgänger experiment. The Mageidentifies her as a student of Hugo Muensterberg.Dolores Cass must have had her own flesh-and-blood model(s). Crowley had theopportunity to meet many young women like her during his summer on the lake, andhe did have a way with women. His familiarity with drugs and magical concoctionsequipped him to pharmacologically induce a fatal heart attack or stroke. Thetricky part was dosing the victim. That is where “Dolores” from Radcliffe couldplay her femme fatale part, maybe as simple as spiking a glass of water on apodium. If the Beast had the satisfaction of disposing of “Moriarty,” it wasanother secret that “he wouldn’t mention—not he.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 Gaunt, 172.2 Ibid.3 Willert, 22-23.4 Troy, 448 and WWP, 6/166,Gaunt to Wiseman, 12 April 1917 and Wiseman to Gaunt,17 April 1917.5 WWP, 6/174, Memorandum on the Scope and Activities of M.I.1.C. in New York, 27April 1917.6 Gaunt, 172.7 WWP, 6/171, Memo sent to Col.

Back in New York, restless andat loose ends, he was, as usual, short of cash. His Confessions skips abruptlyfrom the shores of Lake Pasquaney to New Orleans, ignoring the interveningmonths. He does mention various magical operations, most with an etheraccompaniment, and he had at least one late September rendezvous with Gerda vonKothek, the “Angel of Revolution.” She sent notice by wire that she wasarriving, which signals some urgency.One or two matters in this period merited his interest. The first centered onGeorge Vaux Bacon, a young American journalist and sometime writer for PhotoplayMagazine. British authorities arrested Bacon as a German spy in November 1916;he had been collecting information under the guise of researching wartimeconditions in England.1 Bacon had signed on as a German agent in New York. Hiskey contacts there were Charles “the Dynamiter” Wunnenberg, one of Paul Koenig’srecruiters, and Albert Sander, another journalist and the head of theGerman-American Literary Defense Committee. Sander was another intimate ofViereck’s and the Propaganda Kabinett’s circles, and his job as drama critic forthe Hearst-run Deutsches Journal linked him to Ewers. As usual Crowley had agood vantage to study Sander’s intrigues, including the recruitment of Bacon.Certainly Hall’s men and MI5 were put on Bacon’s trail by tips emanating fromWiseman’s New York section. Sentenced to death in early 1917, Bacon turned onWunnenberg and Sander to save himself. William Offley’s New York BI swooped downon that pair in February 1917, and soon the whole gang was in the federal pen inAtlanta.In the wee hours of 1 November, another event began to unfold. In the pre-dawndarkness, the German merchant submarine Deutschland pulled up to the ConnecticutState Pier in New London, about 120 miles northeast of Manhattan.2 Among thesmall crowd gathered before dawn to welcome her stood sabotage kingpin FrederickHinsch, acting as director of the German-run Eastern Forwarding Co.This was the big U-boat’s second American voyage; its first had been toBaltimore during Crowley’s New Hampshire retreat. This time the 750-tonsubmarine carried a valuable cargo of chemical dyes, medicines, and gems, pluspackets of confidential mail for Ambassador von Bernstorff, and maybe some freshcultures for Anton Dilger’s germ lab in Maryland. The Deutschland was no threatto Britain’s control of the seas, but her ability to slip in and out of Americanports was bad PR for London. The boat’s commander, Capt. Paul Koenig (anotherone), and his crew were fêted as heroes by the locals, and their arrival madethe front page of the New York Times. The Admiralty made a priority ofdestroying or capturing the sub. A few days before its appearance at New London,Gaunt “prophesied” her arrival on 1 November.3During the Deutschland’s twenty days in port, rumors spread of British warshipslurking in ambush just outside the three-mile limit. Meanwhile the submarinehosted a steady stream of visitors, including Bernstorff and Viereck. Viereckeasily could have arranged a glimpse for Crowley and undoubtedly gabbed aboutwhat he saw. The Germans were on guard for mischief. Koenig foiled one attemptby a “crank plotter” to damage his boat, but on her first attempt to leave on 17November she struck a harbor tug, which sank with five men, Hinsch alonesurviving.4 The Deutschland sustained only minor damage, but investigation andlitigation threatened to keep her tied up in New London indefinitely. Britishagents quietly encouraged these entanglements. Koenig and his vessel at lastmade it safely out of port on the night of 21 November and back to Bremen with aload of rubber and nickel. The Deutschland would never return to America.Besides using his German contacts to spy on the Deutschland, the Beast may havehad more ambitious designs. In “The Natural Thing to Do,” Simon Iff speaks ofreturning to England “by the Deutschland.” In the story the vessel is a liner,but no passenger ship had borne that name since before the war, and he wrote thetale soon after the real Deutschland’s appearance. Back in Germany, Capt. Koenigrevealed that there had been some talk of bringing back an unnamed passenger ortwo from America.Crowley had not long before expressed his desire to “go to Germany . . . andreport on the conditions of the country,” an offer rejected by those“unimaginative” British officials.5 Maybe the coming sojourn to New Orleans wasa substitute for this much bolder mission.Crowley was as coy about his reasons for going to the Crescent City as aboutmost of his travels. According to his diary, it was all a “desperate magicaleffort.”6 On 12 November, however, he recorded “receipt of the largest sum ofmoney I have handled in twelve months,” that is, since his last road trip.7 Healso notes that his original destination, as of early November, was Texas. Thepretext for this was a visitor he had received a little earlier, ProfessorLindley Miller Keasbey of the University if Texas at Austin. Keasbey wasinterested in starting a branch of the OTO, and Crowley, as American chief ofthe Order, thought he would lend a personal hand. Then again, maybe there wasmore to it.Keasbey has some familiar traits. The scion of a wealthy New Jersey clan, hegraduated from Harvard and Columbia. He also studied in Germany, where he metand became good friends with Hugo Muensterberg. When the war broke out, Keasbeyadvocated stridently for Germany. The Muentersberg connection may also provide alink between Keasbey and Morgan’s assailant, Erich Muenter. As a fugitive,Muenter had visited Texas and studied in Austin. Keasbey could have had someunwitting part in a Crowley scheme to undo Dr. Muensterberg.As if his pro-Germanism was not enough to arouse trouble, Keasbey held a“socialist revolutionary” political position. Perhaps that gave him connectionto Gerda von Kothek. He bitterly opposed the Wilson Administration and its drifttoward intervention.8 Whether he actively abetted his German friends isuncertain, but U.S. and British authorities found him a person of interest.Keasbey definitely had links to German networks in New Orleans and Mexico. Bythe time of Crowley’s departure, Keasbey’s controversial views had attractedsuch trouble that it doubtless seemed wiser to stay clear.Given his interest in the OTO, Keasbey also could have figured in Crowley’songoing dealings with Reuss. By late 1916, that worthy had shifted his base ofoperations to Monte Verita, the eccentric Swiss enclave mentioned in ChapterTwo. The mood there was overwhelmingly anti-Establishment and anti-war. Reusshoped to maneuver the resident radicals, pacifists, and occultists into anopenly pro-German stance and exploit them for propaganda. To this end, on 22January 1917, Reuss announced the creation of the Anational Grand Lodge andMystic Temple of the Ordo Templi Orientis and Hermetic Brotherhood of Light.This was the first step towards an “Anational Congress” at Monte Verita thatcoming summer. The gathering would bring together like-minded folk from acrosswar-torn Europe and elsewhere to lay the foundations of “new ethics, a newreligion, a new social order” based on vaguely communist principles.9 Reussnoted two “neutral centers” of the Order, in Monte Verita and New York. Thelatter was in the hands of the Beast. Crowley’s name and works figuredprominently in the literature and rituals of the new Lodge, including theGnostic Mass. In January, Reuss unveiled a revised constitution for the OTO, thesame one Crowley was working on in early October.10 The Deutschland could havecarried back a copy in its bag of special mail.Crowley left New York about 4 December and rolled into the Big Easy five dayslater. He remained there for about eight weeks. His rooms at 3402 or 3403Dauphine St. were convenient to the Old Absinthe House and the notorious red-litStoryville, both of which he patronized frequently. Its tolerance of vice madeNew Orleans one of the few places dear to Crowley in America. Its atmosphereunleashed an “ecstasy of creative energy” leading to a string of Simon Iff talesand the beginnings of a novel tentatively titled The Butterfly Net—eventually tobecome Moonchild, Crowley’s roman à clef of wartime occult battles between theWhite and Black Lodges. Among things real and fanciful, it featured his oldmentor and enemy MacGregor Mathers as a German spy.11The Black Lodge and its schemes seemed much on Crowley’s mind. In mid-January1917, he received a letter from Ananda Coomaraswamy in New York. Why theyremained in contact is a puzzle. Something in Coomaraswamy’s letter convincedCrowley that the Eurasian was a true “Black Brother.”12 Did the letter, perhaps,betray to Crowley the movements of other German agents, such as Hanns HeinzEwers?Crowley bemoaned his chronic lack of funds. At one point, he claimed to have amere 70 cents to his name, although he somehow could afford shelter, sustenance,and ether.13 Financial frustration finally provoked him to go “on strike”against the spiritual, and perhaps human, powers that controlled his fortunes.Accumulated resentment over the stinginess of His Majesty’s representativescould have led him to withhold reports as well as rituals and invocations.However distracted and distressed Crowley may have been with literary andmonetary matters, he had to have noticed the arrival of Ewers, and theiroverlapping presence in New Orleans was more than coincidental. Ewersmaterialized in the Crescent City fresh from secret missions in Spain, Mexico,and the Caribbean, which naturally attracted the interest of Britishintelligence. Among other things, the German had spent time in Haitiinvestigating voodoo and the methods of Haitian sorcerers, or bokors, renownedfor their ability to turn persons into zombies. This power, as explained by morerecent investigations, was no mere superstition. Using powerful natural toxinsand assorted herbs and compounds, the magicians could send victims into adeath-like stupor, or simply kill them. A common element in these diabolicalrecipes was powdered human remains, probably to divert attention from a moresecret ingredient.While in New Orleans, Ewers robbed a grave for such ritual purposes.14 In theaftermath, he came down with a persistent and disfiguring case of what seemed tobe psoriasis on his hands, and thought it supernatural retribution. Theaffliction could have had a more natural cause. A few years later, during theIrish “Troubles,” British agents used the powerful caustic in mustard gas toidentify IRA activists.15 Latches and doorknobs at a suspect locale weredoctored with the sticky liquid which gave any who touched them telltale lesionson their hands. Perhaps the Beast played a like trick on Ewers.A closely related application for “corpse powder” was in the concoction ofgoofer dust, a common weapon in the African-based magic practiced in NewOrleans. Dusting the victim’s residence or person would cause misfortune,illness, or even sudden death. This brings to mind the unfortunate Dr.Muensterberg, who died not long after the Mage arrived in New Orleans. Could theMage have mailed something to an accomplice to be administered to the Professorunawares?A 2 February note in Crowley’s Record is significant. It reads, “My 2¼ years’work crowned with success; U.S.A. breaks off relations with Germany.”16 He was alittle prescient; Washington formally severed relations with Berlin the nextday, although it had become inevitable when the Germans proclaimed theresumption of unrestricted submarine warfare on 1 February. Crowley made thisnotation to himself and his gods; whatever his actual influence in bringingabout this event, it establishes that he had been working to that end.Barely a week later, with no explanation, Crowley bolted from New Orleans andheaded east to tiny Titusville on Florida’s Atlantic coast. Here lived hiscousin, Lawrence Bishop, who hosted Crowley until the end of March. He did nottarry with the Bishops because of the amenities or warm reception; Crowleycomplained of ill health and Mrs. Bishop’s surliness. Mooching off relativessaved money, but some other reason must have delayed to return to New York. Washe waiting for something, or lying low?He was not incommunicado. On 28 March, Crowley received a letter from FraterFiat Pax, a.k.a. George Macnie Cowie, financial trustee of the OTO lodge inLondon. Whatever the letter contained enraged and/or frightened the Beast andresulted in a break with Cowie. As the war progressed, recalled Crowley, Cowiebecame “violently anti-German” and started to “intrigue against me.”17 Cowie hadcome to believe reports (whose?) about his master’s pro-German activities andhad decided he could no longer serve such a blackguard. The deciding factor mayhave been Reuss’ recent manifesto, which Cowie must have seen. Whatever theexact cause, Cowie had gone the authorities which stirred up a wave of troublethat reached all the way the Washington.Also at issue was money. According to Crowley, Cowie refused to send him muchneeded funds, including money from the recent sale of the Boleskine property.Part of the problem was that depressed wartime prices and the many mortgagesCrowley had piled on the place left little profit. Nevertheless, the Beastseemed most upset that “the stupid’s [sic] have misinterpreted my whole attitudeand raised trouble.”18 It was serious enough for him to hasten to Washington thenext morning to “straighten this out.”19 That meant meeting with Britishofficials, always a risky move. But Crowley was in a desperate state of mind.Referring to His Majesty’s men in D.C., he vowed that “if I fail this time toget them to listen to sense, at least I can go up to Canada and force them toarrest me. My hand is therefore at last on the lever.”20 He was threatening toblow his cover and provoke an embarrassing situation unless demands (undoubtedlyincluding money) were met. One way or another, he seems to have gotten what hewanted.This crisis and what soon transpired at the London OTO lodge at 93 Regent Streetmust be related. One morning, Scotland Yard detectives raided the premises, gunsdrawn. Inside, according to the amused Mage, were “a dozen mild old peopletrying to browse on the lush grass of my poetry.”21 The officers arrested one ofthem, “a motherly old fool,” for fortune-telling. Officially, the incident hadabsolutely nothing to do with Crowley. That did not stop him from making “awonderful show scene of indignation in the office of The Fatherland which helpedme quite a little on my weary way.”22 Crowley later admitted that the wholepurpose of the raid was to “help me consolidate [restore?] my position with theGermans by heating the branding irons of infamy for me in the fire ofpublicity.” It also was an excellent way to get back at Cowie and otherperceived traitors.The Beast also alleged that Fielding helped choreograph the London stunt. Atfirst glance, this seems doubtful. Feilding was in Cairo working with the ArabBureau as liaison to Naval Intelligence and the EMSIB, and thus hardly situatedto arrange police raids in London. In the Cairo post, however, Feilding workedclosely with the NILI spy ring of Zionist Jews working for Britain against theTurks.23 The NILI group had political allies and financial connections to thesame Zionist circles in New York that were working closely with Wiseman andSection V. Thus Crowley and Feilding had a confidential means to stay in touch.Feilding’s intervention in the London flap removed any need for directcommunication between Crowley and persons there. In any case, the ploy seems tohave worked. Viereck and others were reassured (if Viereck needed any) ofCrowley’s pariah status among the British. In July 1917, Viereck even namedCrowley editor-in-chief of his monthly International.Meanwhile, U.S.-German relations continued to deteriorate. Fresh U-boat attacksenflamed the situation, as did the 1 March publication of the ZimmermannTelegram, intercepted and provided to Washington by Admiral Hall’s Room 40. Init German Foreign Secretary Zimmermann advocated a German-Mexican-Japanesealliance against the U.S. On 6 April, with Crowley back roaming the streets ofNew York, Washington declared war.Immediately most of the remaining German agents, including Dilger, Hinsch, andJahnke, made tracks for Mexico, where they continued their plotting, albeitfeebly. Nevertheless, the outspoken German propagandist Aleister Crowleysuffered no problems, nor did his boss, George Sylvester Viereck. He simplychanged the name of The Fatherland to Viereck’s Weekly and maintained itspublication uninterrupted. This did not fool the BI and MID, but they let themagazine and Viereck go on unmolested, despite ample evidence of his continuedassociation with suspect persons.24 Oddest of all, in early 1918 Americaninvestigators actually consulted Viereck on Ewers’ doings.25But new players were on the scene. Baron Georg von Polenz, an intimate ofViereck, entered the U.S. legally in mid-1916, having been released frominternment by the Canadians. Ambassador Bernstorff personally arranged this inexchange for the release of a Canadian prisoner by Austria-Hungary. Von Polenz’svalue in the exchange remains a mystery, but he also was closely connected tovon Alvensleben.26 Von Polenz set up shop as a New York stockbroker with anoffice on Broadway and an abundance of capital. Later investigation revealedthat he was involved in fraudulent stock schemes, but he also was the secretpatron of Viereck’s Weekly, which continued to “indirectly [promote] Germanpropaganda with money furnished by the German Government.”27Alvo von Alvensleben remained free until 10 August 1917, when BI agents,answering local complaints, arrested him in Portland, Oregon. From there he wentto the internment camp at Fort Douglas, Utah. The only evidence the Americansever offered against Alvo was a report “provided to the Justice Department byBritish intelligence” before the American declaration of war.28 Alvo’s nameheaded a list of “dangerous” German agents received from Horace D. Nugent, theBritish Consul in Chicago. Nugent got it from an unnamed Britishoperative—perhaps Crowley.As for Hanns Heinz Ewers, the Americans monitored him throughout 1917 and early1918 but held back, perhaps at British suggestion. The Yanks consulted NormanThwaites, who offered that Ewers had been on “the British Black List for sometime” but did not urge his seizure.29 Was that because he was of more value toCowley at large?When the order for Ewers’ arrest finally came on 13 June 1918 (he was taken intocustody on 27 June), officers got right to work ransacking his apartment. Theirsubsequent report mentions two interesting letters found among his papers. One,dated 16 August 1917, from Otto Kahn, the banker and British asset inside Kuhn,Loeb, pertained to financing of Ewers’ plays, and showed Kahn to have been oneof his longtime backers. The other letter was from Aleister Crowley. No date isgiven, but Crowley’s indicated address was 64-A West 9th Street, which suggestssometime during October 1917-June 1918. The report says nothing about theletter’s contents other than that it “appears to have been written by someonementally weak.”30 In any event, it shows the two occultists to have been incontact at least to late 1917 and perhaps right up to the time of Ewers’ arrest.America’s entry into the war had serious implications for British intelligencein the States. What had been heretofore a clandestine and technically illegaloperation now emerged from the shadows, partly. Collaboration with Americanauthorities became formalized and subject to official scrutiny. Furthermore, theAmericans took charge of combating German intrigue, while British agents wouldmerely advise, at least in theory. This ignited a fresh debate about which ofLondon’s agencies should handle intelligence liaison with the new ally. VernonKell insisted that everything should rest with MI5. The situation came to headin April 1917 when Kell’s man Claude Dansey (John Quinn’s old friend) landed inGotham. Wiseman expected Dansey to take over.31 In the end, though, for reasonsneither Sir William nor Dansey ever discussed, the turnover did not happen.MI1c’s Section V retained its independence and pre-eminence on the Americanscene.This is not to say that nothing changed. Wiseman, now at President Wilson’sside, was more and more consumed by political duties. That left Section V in theexpert hands of Norman Thwaites. Meanwhile Gaunt’s role withered toinsignificance, and soon he was headed back to England for good.A shift in authority to MI5 certainly would not have boded well for Crowley;that agency regarded him as a disloyal subversive who merited immediate arrest.In any event, his relationship with British officialdom appears to have becomeincreasingly strained in 1917. He had long complained that they needlesslysubjected him to repeated, pointless “tests,” but that summer insult was addedto injury when “our Secret Service” sent a “Temporary Gentleman” (wartimeofficer) to deal with him.32 In the standard version of Confessions, the man’sname is given as “H…d,” but in the original it is “H…l” and further identifiedby a handwritten notation as “Hall.” This pegs him as Frederick Hall. Posing asa journalist, Hall arrived in New York on 1 September and promptly joined theThwaites-Wiseman crew at 44 Whitehall. Wiseman’s papers show that he wasassigned to “general work” connected with personal contacts (informants) in theAmerican press and intelligence bodies.33 Crowley told him about his specialrelationship with “a man high in the German Secret Service” and of hiswillingness to go to Germany and report on conditions there. In response, Hallseemed untrusting and infuriatingly dense. Most likely, the Beast’s pride washurt by being subjected to questioning by a low-ranking nincompoop.But the Beast was not wholly dependent on British largesse. In the wake ofAmerica’s joining the war, his collaboration with the Yankees increased, or sohe claimed. In another passage later deleted from Confessions, he boasted thatthe “Department [of Justice] used me to the full” and “helped me in everypossible way, and to my astonishment (almost amounting to collapse!) they wereeven grateful to me for what I did to help them!”34 Supposedly he cadged enoughmoney out of the Americans to pay off debts.As opposed to the Department of Justice proper, it is possible that his actualwork was performed for the American Protective League. That also could explainthe dearth of records in Bureau files. This ostensibly private, patrioticorganization became a de facto arm of Justice and the BI. It raised a250,000-strong army of citizen spies to root out subversion and disloyalty fromevery facet of American life. While APL operatives were mostly true-blueAmericans, Crowley could easily have joined up in cosmopolitan New York. Asnoted, the Gotham APL included an informant, A-139, who provided regular,detailed reports on the activities of Frank Harris and Raffalovitch and had a“private” channel to Lt. Fitzroy and the British Consulate.Immediately after his return to New York, Crowley moved into a studio on FifthAvenue run by Leon Engers Kennedy. A fellow Brit, Kennedy was another member ofOTO and A∴A∴. He painted the portrait of the Beast dressed in a red robe thatlater graced the cover of the revived Equinox and other works. From mid-1917,Crowley also focused on magical pursuits and writing. In August, he recorded noless than ten “operations” in twelve days, all or most involving sex anddrugs.35 On 14 June, Crowley recorded an entry that summed up his recentexperiences or at least tried to explain them: “All my sympathies are profoundlywith the Allies; but my brain refuses to think as sympathizers seem to; so inargument I often seem ‘pro-German’; hence constant muddle not in myself but inothers who observe me.”36 In the same entry he noted his inner conflict of a“socialistic, anarchistic brain” and an “aristocratic heart.”New magical-sexual partners came and went. In August he met Anna Miller, withwhom he briefly shared a new flat on Central Park West at 110th Street. LaMiller, of German extraction, soon proved another unstable drunk. By Octoberthere was Roddie Minor, a married woman, also of German extraction, withsupposed psychic talents. He proclaimed her the newest incarnation of theScarlet Woman, and the two took up cohabitation on West 9th Street in GreenwichVillage.Among his “lesser” initiates and sexual partners were actress Eva Tanguay and aneighteen-year-old Russian, Marie Lavroff (Maria Lavrov), later named MarieRoehling. Lavroff was connected to Apollonarii Semenovskii, an official of theRussian Provisional (“Kerenskii”) Government recently assigned to Petrograd’sconsulate-general in New York. He and Marie, his ward and perhaps mistress,arrived in America on 4 November, three days before the German-backed Leninseized power in Petrograd. Among Semenovskii’s friends and colleagues at theRussian Consulate was Lev Arkadievich Shumatov, a devotee of the mystic (andpossible British agent) Gurdjieff.The atmosphere in the Russian Consulate and its satellite commissions became oneof utter confusion as Soviet agents, Provisional regime officials, and Tsaristreactionaries vied for control. Back in Russia, Semenovskii had been linked toCol. B.V. Nikitin, the head of the Provisional Government’s counterintelligenceservice. Nikitin had tried but mostly failed to expose Bolshevik-Germancollusion, and Semenovskii may have been assigned such investigations in NewYork. Thus Crowley’s dalliance with Lavroff could help keep him apprised ofRussian intrigues.Another local Russian whom Crowley must have met was the pale, effeminate, andsinister Boris L’vovich Brasol.37 After brief service at the front and a stintin London, Lieutenant Brasol came to the U.S. in summer 1916 as a special legalrepresentative of the Tsarist Government. Among other duties, he served on theInter-Allied Board and the Anglo-Russian [Supply] Subcommittee, where he rubbedelbows with British officials. Brasol’s secret task was ferreting out enemyagents and subversives among the local Russians. He zealously pursued radicalswhile ignoring German intrigues, which raised suspicion about Brasol’s ownloyalties. For instance, he effectively quashed an investigation into Germancorruption of Russian officers. This so-called “Nekrassov Affair” involvedcharacters already known to us and Crowley.38 Among them were the TheosophistBaroness von Seidlitz and the Russian revolutionist Ivan Narodny, mentionedearlier in connection with Marie von Sievers and Rudolf Steiner. Also mixed upin the business were Gaunt and Thwaites.Brasol fancied himself literary and adored Edgar Allen Poe, whom Hanns HeinzEwers also passionately admired. In fact, Ewers wrote an essay on Poe in 1916that Brasol added to his library. Beyond that, Brasol took a discreet butintense interest in the supernatural, which offered another point of connectionwith not only Ewers but also Crowley. Brasol’s greatest passion, however, washis anti-Semitism, a subject revisited in the next chapter.39In America one effect of Bolshevism’s ascendance in Russia was a frenziedreaction against all forms of radicalism as subversive tools of Germanmilitarism. In New York City, Alfred Becker led the attack—a man also destinedto become Crowley’s closest American contact and sometime guardian angel. Itprobably was with Becker’s and others’ encouragement that the Mage would firmlyestablish himself in Greenwich Village, the capital of radicalism and bohemianculture in the U.S.One notable visitor to the Village in early 1917 was Leon Trotsky, soon tobecome Lenin’s second-in-command. Crowley was in New Orleans and Florida at thetime, but his friend Frank Harris interviewed Trotsky. Ivan Narodny, theanti-Tsarist émigré mentioned above, was also interested in Trotsky.40 An activerevolutionary and fierce enemy of Berlin and the Bolsheviks, Narodny sharedCrowley’s interest in art and the metaphysical. Both frequented the soirées ofanother of the Beast’s New York friends, the eccentric artist Robert WinthropChanler.41 These swinging gettogethers provided an excellent means to sow andreap information.Soon after the Bolsheviks came to power, Crowley wrote to Trotsky to praise theRevolution and offer help in ridding the Earth of the scourge of Christianity.42So far as can be told, Trotsky never responded to the overture—wisely so.Everything in Crowley’s modus operandi suggests his display of radicalsympathies was a new twist on his old game: agent provocateur.Crowley could have pointed to his affiliation with Reuss and the “AnationalCongress for Re-Establishing Society on Practical Cooperative Lines” as proof ofhis bona fides to the Bolsheviks and their friends. That body finally convenedduring 15-25 August 1917 at Monte Verita. While not expressly communist, thetemper of the Congress was openly collectivist and anti-capitalist. Crowley didnot attend, of course, but Reuss openly touted Thelema as the official religionof the coming revolutionary epoch.During early 1918 Crowley’s attention was consumed by one of his biggest magicalefforts, the Alamantrah Working. Also involved were Roddie Minor, in the keyrole of medium, along with Marie Lavroff, Eva Tanguay, and other devotees. Theaim was to open a doorway to the astral realm and contact its denizens. Crowleyreckoned it a great success. For our purposes, the significance of theAlamantrah Working is that Crowley’s efforts to capitalize on its resultsdominated the remainder of his stay in the U.S. and sent him on two more MagicalRetreats, both with underlying intelligence agendas.As usual, Crowley’s finances were precarious. Viereck sold The International,and there went his regular paycheck. He also griped, “the British would notemploy me,” and while the Department of Justice remained “warmly appreciative ofmy work,” their warmth fell short of generosity.43 On the other hand, paychecksfrom both governments probably could not have kept up with Crowley’sprodigality.Meantime, German clandestine activities were still alive, if weakened. In March1918, just as the Alamantrah Working was winding down, events in New York criedout for agent Crowley’s special touch. They centered on the Americans’ pursuitof a group of female agents working for Germany and its allies. One of thesedubious ladies was twenty-something Despina Dawidovitch Storch. She claimedTurkish origin but was in fact Russian Jewish.44 Sophisticated, beautiful, andable to lie in many languages, she materialized in Paris before the war to wedthe unfortunate provider of her best-known surname. In 1913, in London, shebriefly had another husband, British Army officer James Hesketh. A year later,Despina was back in Paris as the mistress of a dissolute French nobleman, Baronde Beville, restyling herself “Baroness de Beville.” She spent part of 1915 inSpain, when Ewers was roaming about there. Her description closely matches thatof a mysterious femme connected to him, and Ewers probably accompanied her andthe Baron back to the Americas.In New York, Storch, Beville, and another shady couple with aristocraticaffectations lavishly entertained their way into Gotham social circles. Theseincluded Chanler’s gatherings and the occult salon run by von Seidlitz, whointroduced Storch to the same gang of corrupt Russians as were being spied on byNarodny and Lavroff’s friend Semenovskii.45 The aim of Storch’s ring, Americaninvestigators found, was intelligence on munitions production and shipments,“transmitted to Berlin through channels which are not open to inspection byAllied censors.”46 That sounds curiously similar to the communication “withoutthe use of either the telegraph or cable systems” allegedly used by Crowley andPlummer.47The BI and Secret Service offices in New York discovered Storch’s operation inlate 1917, immediately after the Mage began consorting with Marie Lavroff.Having infiltrated her circle, the Americans picked up Storch and heraccomplices on 18 March 1918. She confessed with surprising alacrity (peyoteagain?), but to the consternation of her captors the seemingly healthy youngwoman suddenly died of what looked like acute pneumonia. Some suspected theSpanish flu, others foul play, but nothing could be proved.Despina Storch did reveal enough to help put two of her sister spies behindbars, Baroness von Seidlitz and a more recent reinforcement, Maria de Victorica.The Americans arrested both in late April. Maria de Victorica, a.k.a. Maria vonKretschmann, Mlle. Vussiere, and other aliases, was one of the few female agentsto meet Hollywood standards.48 About forty when she arrived in New York aboard aNorwegian steamer on 21 January 1917, she was an erudite cosmopolitan whose“blonde, bold attractiveness” had seduced her Chilean husband into spying forBerlin, as it had many others.49Her assignment in the States was to “carry on German and pacifist propagandathrough the Catholic Church and to assure Irish revolutionaries of the backingof Germany.”50 The Catholic angle may mesh somehow with Crowley’s interest inthat faith as noted by Watts. Beyond that, through her collaboration withClan-na Gael and allied Irish groups, Victorica certainly met people Crowleyknew, if not the Beast himself. Her grander aims were to initiate a freshsabotage offensive against British ships (to coincide with the renewal ofunrestricted submarine warfare) and to drum up support for a new uprising inIreland.51Obviously, British intelligence had reasons to watch her. Once more, theAmericans found Victorica’s trail in November 1917 through information providedby the “British Secret Service.”52 Crowley was an ideal source. Handling thecase for the BI was Superintendent Charles de Woody, who was close to AttorneyGeneral Becker. Like Storch, Victorica ended up at the presumably securemilitary jail on Ellis Island. Her severe morphine addiction complicatedquestioning. Given his pharmacological savoir faire, Crowley could have advisedon how best to exploit Victorica’s cravings. Withdrawal aside, Victorica fellill with symptoms identical to Storch’s, and American authorities now fearedthat some sort of “scientific murderer” was at work.53 Whether or not heraffliction was scientifically or magically caused, she recovered and went on togive damning testimony in several espionage and sedition trials.In mid-1918 Frank Harris introduced Crowley to another American writer andjournalist, William Seabrook, who described the Mage as reminding him of “anursery imp masquerading as Mephistopheles.”54 Fascinated by all things occultand grotesque (he boasted of having once eaten human flesh), Seabrook formed animmediate bond with Crowley. Another dimension to their relationship probablyremained invisible to Seabrook. His employer, press mogul William RandolphHearst, had used his newspapers to promote a strongly anti-British andanti-interventionist stance, much to the annoyance of His Majesty’s officials inNew York and London. Hearst corresponded with Viereck, and according to theBureau of Investigation, “there was no other man whose attitude was so friendlyto Germany during the war.”55 Crowley’s friendship with Seabrook fit a nowfamiliar pattern, cultivating a source of information inside the enemy camp.Crowley later described the summer of 1918 as “uneventful.”56 On 17 July,however, our man was summoned to the Murray Hill Hotel which housed the officesof Attorney General Becker, where Crowley was quizzed about his work for theGermans and the British “Secret Service.”57 At the meeting, Becker’s agents(though not Becker himself) probed the Beast about the activities of EdwardRumley, the pro-German editor of The New York Evening Mail.58 Rumley was afriend of Viereck and suspected of taking German money. He also was part of thespy ring set up by Victorica. What Crowley had to say about Rumley and friendsunfortunately is not revealed.Two days after the meeting, the Mage borrowed some money from Seabrook andheaded up the Hudson River in a leaky canoe. His purpose, he claimed, was amagical retreat on Esopus (Aesopus) Island, a rocky, uninhabited speck betweenPoughkeepsie and Kingston.Crowley paddled north past the small town of Garrison and the Society ofAtonement’s nearby Graymoor Manor. Near Newburgh a violent storm forced himashore,where he found unexpected hospitality from an English gentlemanacquainted with Crowley’s Aunt Annie. It was a one in a million chance, or nochance at all. The gentleman was Jonathan T. Whitehead, a wealthy Britishbusinessman who had a summer house there. Perhaps he and the Master Therion hadmet before. Doing business in the City, Whitehead was very familiar with theBritish Consulate and its officials. If Crowley needed a cut-out to stay incontact with New York, Whitehead fit the bill perfectly. Whitehead later paid atleast one visit to the Mage’s Esopus camp—on the pretext of answering Crowley’sprayers for fresh prawns.59Crowley made a spectacle of himself on the island, writing “Do What Thou Wilt”and other slogans on the surrounding cliffs with the gallons of red paint he hadbrought along. His spiritual exercises often compelled him to sit motionless inthe same spot for hours, which naturally intrigued the locals. Still, hismagical and physical needs required a female presence. Mrs. Minor paid a fewvisits, but when the already tattered relationship disintegrated for good,Crowley was temporarily hard up.He found a remedy during a brief return to Manhattan on 19 August. The mainpurpose of the visit was “OTO business,” but he also visited Becker’s office. Onthis errand, Crowley encountered a friend of Seabrook, the artist and puppeteerTony Sarg, who knew just the girl willing to give it up to a stranger on adeserted island.60 The arrangement certainly was not so accidental, contraCrowley. The young woman was the aspiring actress Madeline George, atwice-divorced, petite brunette whom one ex-husband described as “very erraticand an adventuress” and capable of just about anything.61 Anything may haveincluded espionage. Madeline had recently attracted the attention of Britishintelligence by entertaining a string of officers in her Montreal hotel room.The British shared with the Americans their suspicion that La George was playingMata Hari, a suspicion supported by her contact with real or supposed Germanagents such as Baroness von Seidlitz and Edward Rumley.62 Becker’s men likelytapped Crowley to turn the tables on the wily Madeline and seduce secrets fromher.As the Beast later told it, after leaving a note at George’s hotel, he returnedto his island lair and offered prayers for her swift arrival. The next day,Crowley received a wire from Madeline asking him to meet her at the stationnearby in Hyde Park. There he noticed “a tall, distinguished, military-lookingman, who seemed to be eyeing me strangely.”63 This was Maj. James B. Ord, theMID’s resident officer in West Point, who kept an eye on the lower HudsonValley. According to Crowley, the Major approached him and explained that hispresence on Esopus had provoked much concern locally. Upon querying New York,however, Ord was surprised to learn that “[Crowley] was . . . working for theDepartment of Justice.”64 Crowley happily confided to the Major that the DJ(more probably Becker) “had instructed me to keep my eyes open for anysuspicious incidents.” Like Simon Iff, Crowley helped Ord clear up a minormystery involving strange lights and troop trains and even reported on a coupleof doubtful nocturnal boaters—or so says Crowley.Crowley’s version of events is basically true but also misleading. The otherside of the story is in Ord’s report to his MID superiors in Washington. Ordwrote that Crowley interested his office because of his connection to MadelineGeorge and her trip to the Island. Making inquiries with the New York BI,specifically de Woody, Ord learned that Crowley served the British and had beeninvestigated and “cleared” by Becker. Still, Ord was not altogether convinced.“In view of the information that has been gathered within the past two months[August-September],” he noted, “it may be possible that Aleister Crowley isdouble crossing the British Government ... the case has not been completed asyet.”65 The Major apparently kept the Beast under surveillance and was notreassured by what he found out. The dossier gives no further details.Expurgated passages from Crowley’s later account provide a few more tantalizingclues. First, he had a gun with him, which suggests that he was anticipatingsome sort of trouble. In his absence, Madeline discovered it hidden among hisbedding and threw it in the bushes. That argues she was not quite so trustingafter all. Also, according to the Beast, she feared that he was going to lead a“squad of secret-service men” back to the island, presumably to arrest her.66Extraordinary coincidences surround Crowley’s Esopus adventure. On 4 July 1918,a British traveler, Guy Varley Rayment, arrived in New York on Admiralty orders.Rayment was an NID officer and Admiral Hall’s representative to theInterdepartmental Committee on Indian sedition. He stayed at the Brevoort Hotel,unseemly lodging for a naval intelligence officer. On the edge of GreenwichVillage, the Brevoort was a popular watering hole for the local radical andBoho-literati crowd, among them Crowley’s friend and mescaline guinea pigTheodore Dreiser. Crowley dined there often as it was barely a block away fromhis rooms on 9th Street.Rayment remained in the U.S. for three months, covering the time Crowley was atEsopus. During this same period, Assistant Secretary of the Navy FranklinRoosevelt made a special trip to Europe, and Rayment had some role in arrangingdetails. FDR sailed from New York aboard a U.S. Navy destroyer just five daysafter Rayment’s arrival. Upon reaching England, Roosevelt received an especiallywarm greeting from Rayment’s and Crowley’s boss Admiral Hall, who gave theSecretary a tour of Room 40. As discussed further in the following chapter, FDRwas fascinated by cloak-and-dagger affairs and ran his own special unit of navalintelligence. The future president also took a lively interest in the occult.Roosevelt had cooperated closely with Gaunt, Thwaites, and other Britishoperatives well before the U.S. officially joined the war. FDR later liked toboast that his pro-Allied activities earned him the #2 spot on a secret Germanlist of troublesome Americans “to be eliminated.”67 The common assumption isthat this was one of FDR’s fantasies, but British agents may have planted theidea to flatter and manipulate him.Esopus, recall, was near Hyde Park, which lay in the county where Robert Chanlerhad been (or still was) sheriff. Close to Hyde Park was Springwood, the familyhome of Franklin Roosevelt. Did mere chance put the Mage at this spot, or was hedirected there by Rayment or Becker? Becker knew Roosevelt well via New YorkState politics and may have felt a special obligation to the Navy Secretary. Oneconcern, given the alleged German threat against FDR, could have been aMeunter-style assault on the Roosevelt household in FDR’s absence. Crowley mightnot have been much of a deterrent to any physical attack, but he could keep aneye out for suspicious characters. Moreover, the Storch and Victorica cases hadraised real concerns about the enemy’s use of “occult” methods, and who wasbetter prepared to deal with something like that?On 11 October, soon after he returned to New York, Crowley was summoned again toBecker’s office, presumably for debriefing about his recent adventures up theHudson. This time he spoke with Becker himself, and passed what he described asa “delightful evening, telling my tale.” The Beast added that Becker was “vastlyamazed” and a bit aghast that some of his best operatives had “spent weeks ofpainstaking strategy on the trail of a man from the department next door.”68According to Becker’s side of the story, he quizzed his guest on “his knowledgeof German propaganda.”69 Much of the discussion focused on Theodor Reuss and theOTO. Crowley provided Becker with a copy of Reuss’s 22 January 1917proclamation. According to Becker, “Mr. Crowley has characterized the circular .. . as being German propaganda.”70 He reminded Becker that Reuss may have cometo the U.S. during the war and that he had “previously informed the Bureau” ofthat.71 He also asserted that Reuss had “some considerable official position inGermany.”72 In later testimony before the U.S. Senate, Becker admitted that“Aleister Crowley and his organization may be classified as a dubiousproposition,” but he denied that the Mage had been a German tool. Crowley’sgroup, opined Becker, was merely a “pacifist affair.”73--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 Details of Bacon’s case can be found in USNA, KV2/4-5.

Old conflicts continued and new ones erupted as the diplomats gatheredin Paris. Fighting would drag on for months or years in Russia, the Middle East,and Ireland. The spread of Communism fueled new hopes and fears, igniting aworldwide secret war to advance or contain it, one in which Crowley would playhis part. Still, in America, the situation seemed bright and clear. Germany andher allies were beaten, their intrigues kaput. Britain and the U.S. glowed withmutual admiration, and British intelligence could roll up its tent and go home.The reality was starkly different, especially behind the public display ofaffection between London and Washington. Britain had gone to war against Germanyas against the Empire’s primary naval and commercial rival. With the Reich’sdefeat, the United States assumed both positions. As long as London’s andWashington’s policies harmonized, peace would prevail; if not, armed conflictcould easily erupt. Even before the war was over, Wiseman warned his chief,Mansfield Cumming, that the American establishment was full of persons “afraidof the influence of the British Navy” and “still afraid of George III.”1Likewise many in the British Admiralty, Crowley’s employer, saw American navalpower as a greater menace than Germany’s had ever been. The U.S. was simply abigger, stronger, and (thanks especially to war profits) richer nation. It alsowas one to which Britain was deeply in debt. Just as the Germans had, theAmericans now merited careful watching.While many American officials continued to help to their British colleagues,some grew suspicious. In late 1918, Justice Department officials began to balkat sharing information with the British. For example, Nathan’s demand to see allreports on Irish agitation sparked strong objections.2 Part of this reluctancecame from new officials at Justice and its BI, among them Wilson’s Red-huntingAttorney General A. Mitchell Palmer. At Palmer’s side was his hand-picked chiefof the Radical Division, the punctilious and suspicious young John Edgar Hoover.Hoover suspected the British not only of general bad faith, but also ofmanipulating the radical movement for their own obscure purposes. He was correcton both counts. As one Bureau report put it, “the British have betterinformation concerning radical activities in this country and it is known thatto secure this information they must have a very efficient force in operation.”3This shift inevitably affected Crowley’s relationship with American agencies.His German intrigues had afforded him many links to the radical underground, ashad Greenwich Village’s bohemian circles. Among his Village neighbors, forinstance, was anarchist firebrand Emma Goldman, then running a massage parloroff 17th Street. The voluptuous Beast is sure to have enjoyed a good rub there.As noted earlier, Red Emma was the comrade and paramour of anarchist AlexanderBerkman. Like Crowley both were friends of Frank Harris. A few years later inParis, the Beast tried to cadge money out of Goldman, an overture arguing someprior acquaintance. Crowley’s movements at the end of his American stay are alsostrangely synchronous with Berkman’s and Goldman’s.The end of the war also weakened but did not end Crowley’s relationship withBritish intelligence. It first seemed that Section V would shut down completely.William Wiseman, now full-time “Liaison Officer between the British War Cabinetand Washington,” was consumed by the upcoming Peace Conference. Before the yearwas out, however, he informed subordinates in New York that, while the SISstation would be scaled back, Cumming was determined to maintain a Britishintelligence presence.Postwar intelligence work for the British in America focused on the “IrishProblem.” This escalated in January 1919, when Sinn Fein parliamentariansproclaimed independence in Dublin. Guerrilla warfare and bloody reprisals spreadacross the Emerald Isle. Indian nationalist unrest likewise continued.Disturbingly, in place of Berlin, Irish and Indian dissidents found a newchampion—Red Moscow.In February 1919, control of the reduced SIS station at 44 Whitehall Street.passed to the able hands of Robert Nathan, aided by the trusty Norman Thwaites.Although his primary focus was the Irish case, Nathan broadly scrutinizedradical activities in New York and around the country. He and Thwaites“recovered and re-organized a number of useful informants” to keep tabs on“Bolshevists, I.W.W., trouble-makers, Anarchists, etc.”4 Nathan did not overlookan experienced asset like Crowley, with his links to Americancounterintelligence, the Irish and Indian spheres, and New York’s radicaldemimonde.The Beast had something more in common with a mysterious figure that joined theBritish operation in March 1919 and eventually took control of it. This manvariously styled himself “Ronald Strath” (apparently his true name), “Dr.Alexander Edmund Strath-Gordon,” “Captain James,” and “Charles Fox.” Theforty-six-year-old Strath was born in Dublin, studied in Edinburgh, and servedin the Boer War. Later he was a medical officer ministering to the Cree Indiansin remote northern Manitoba.5 There he took an interest in shamanistic medicine,an early example of his esoteric and occult studies. A theosophist, or at leaststrongly influenced by Theosophy, he later founded the Atlantean ResearchSociety, which sought to recover and apply the secrets of the legendary lostcivilization. It almost goes without saying that Strath was a 33rd-degree Mason.In WWI, Strath joined the Canadian Army Medical Corps, but ultimately foundhimself in MI5, probably recruited by Nathan. Captain Ronald Strath joined theBritish Mission in New York in March 1919 and worked there through 31 August. AU.S. naval intelligence report identifies “Captain Strath-Gordon” as the man whorelieved Thwaites of his post in March.6Nathan left for England by August, and Thwaites soon after. At the same time,Ronald Strath vanished from MI5’s roster, and “Captain James” appeared as headof the SIS section concealed within the New York Consulate’s Passport ControlOffice.7 Thereafter identified as the “head of the British Secret Service forcein the United States” with “charge of all operatives,” James received agents athis home in Elmhurst, Long Island, where “a great many secret meetings areheld.”8 As alter ego “Charles Fox,” Strath communicated with other agentsthrough a post box in Manhattan’s City Hall Station. City Hall Station was closeto Crowley’s new abode on Greenwich Village’s Washington Square.The new intrigues in New York picked up some threads from 1917. During 29- 31October of that year, the “League of Small and Subject Nationalities” held itsopening congress at Manhattan’s McAlpin Hotel. At the conclave, representativesof some twenty-five national and ethnic groups, including Albanians, Assyrians,Koreans, Serbs, and even Swedes, called for recognition or independence.9Anti-militarism and anti-imperialism were the leading themes, and Irish andIndians predominated among attendees, generating a strongly anti-British mood.10There also was a strong undertone of radicalism; the gathering included manyanarchists and socialists, and quite a few future communists. Even Crowley’s oldcomrades the Jacobites sent a representative, the soi-disant Chief of ClannFhearghuis of Stra-Chur, who spoke for Scotland. Was the unnamed Chief adisguised Beast reprising his role as a Highland laird?At the head of the League stood Dr. Frederic C. Howe, the commissioner ofimmigration for the Port of New York and a former Wilson loyalist alienated bythat President’s interventionist and “repressive” policies. Howe’s right-handman was former Assistant Secretary of State Dudley Field Malone, a fellowleftist and disgruntled Wilsonite who had recently resigned as Collector ofCustoms. We have encountered him before in connection to the Lusitania and theoperations of the U.S. Secret Service. Malone would go on to serve as attorneyfor German spy Maria de Victorica and the “Soviet Government Bureau” thatappeared in New York in early 1919.11 During 1919, he took over the above Leagueand retooled it into the openly pro-Bolshevik “League of Oppressed Peoples.”12That body was linked to a Soviet-backed one of the same name in Berlin.To no surprise, British intelligence spied on Malone. In July 1919, Wiseman,back in New York on ostensibly private business, wrote to Prime Minister DavidLloyd George’s office, “Our friend Dudley Malone has come out as a regularsocialist revolutionary leader. He spends his time trying to keep the Bolsheviksout of jail [but] he is still a most delightful companion and sends you hislove.”13 Was Malone also a British asset? If so, did Crowley know?Of more interest to us is the claim that “Aleister Crowley, the well-knownSatanist, who was then working in the United States for Germany, was connectedwith this [League of Oppressed Peoples] through one of its agents in America....”14 So asserted Nesta Webster, a pioneer of conspiracy theory, unreservedBritish-imperialist, anti-radical, and anti-Semite. Despite her own fascinationwith spiritualism and reincarnation, Webster constantly fretted about thenefarious doings of secret societies, especially Freemasons and their kin. Shewas certain that Aleister Crowley was an instrument of the Powers of Darkness.While Webster’s interpretation of data frequently veered off into the bizarreand obsessive, she also dredged up weird but verifiable details. She suggeststhat the same individual who connected Crowley to the Leagues also got him towrite “an obscene libel on the King,” which sounds like a reference to theBeast’s 1915 piece for Open Court. That points to Viereck, who knew Malone andmany others involved. Yet another Crowley link to the Small and SubjectNationalities realm was former acolyte turned German paymaster GeorgeRaffalovitch.The tale of the Leagues gets curiouser. According to Webster, the American-basedLeague of Oppressed Peoples was taken over and moved to Berlin by “a mysteriousAmerican, subsidizer of a defeatist paper in Switzerland, acting under thedirect orders of a powerful pan-German secret society—the Druidenorden [sic].”15There is at least some truth in this. The American was John Wesley De Kay, aprewar entrepreneur in Mexico whose crooked financial dealings forced him toflee U.S. justice to Europe. Early in the war, he engaged in shady arms dealsfor Pancho Villa and other Mexican factions as a front for the Germans. TheFrench later arrested him for defrauding the Belgian Army. In 1917, he tookrefuge in Switzerland, where British intelligence identified him as “chief ofthe sabotage and murder section of the German [Secret Service].”16 De Kay alsowrote and subsidized publications promoting social revolution and pacifism,guided at first by the “extreme Junker party in Germany” and later by the“Propaganda Section of the Communist International.” His wartime activities inSwitzerland display a strong similarity to those of Reuss, and some connectionsurely existed. So, it is not hard to see how Crowley, or at least Crowley’sname, could be roped into this nexus.During 1919, the busy Mr. De Kay collected funds from both the Soviets and acontinuing “German Secret Bureau” to form a new society to “unite all theRevolutionary Parties of different countries to further the mutual cause”. 17 Aprime goal of this organization was the destruction of the British Empire. DeKay created a true secret society, sealed with oaths of grisly death totraitors. The precise relationship of this body to the League of OppressedPeoples (Vereinigung Vergewaeltister Voelker) in Berlin and Malone’s like-namedNew York group remains vague, but there were common conspiratorial threads.British sources, which may have included the Beast, reported that De Kay was“endeavoring to link up” his society with Malone’s.18British intelligence also identified one of De Kay’s key backers and his secretsociety’s #2 as Count Ernst zu Reventlow. This German naval officer, a militantexpansionist, earned the nickname “High Priest of German Frightfulness” for hisunrelenting advocacy of U-boat warfare and other hard-nosed policies.19 TheCount loathed England, which he saw as Germany’s most dangerous enemy. In thepostwar environment, this drew Reventlow to those reactionary Germans who alliedthemselves with the Bolsheviks to continue clandestine war against PerfidiousAlbion.Since the Count’s bloodthirsty sentiments exactly matched the line Crowley waspushing on the Germans in the States, mutual admiration blossomed. In February1917, the Beast’s piece “Delenda est Britannia” ran in The Fatherland. It was aglowing review of Reventlow’s recent book The Vampire of the Continent, avituperative assault on Britain and all it stood for. Crowley’s personal copycame over on the Deutschland. He proudly recalled the article as one of his best“counter-propaganda” efforts, and that it helped to persuade Bernstorff tosupport unrestricted submarine warfare even as it reached new heights ofabsurdity by advocating England’s reduction to “a German colony.”20Another conspicuous detail is that Reventlow’s sister, the writer and “CosmicCountess” Franziska zu Reventlow, was a luminary of Monte Verita during thewar.21 She knew Reuss well, and one of her last stories, Wir Spione, dealt withaccusations of espionage among residents of a neutral “health resort.”Like nearly everyone linked to Crowley, Reventlow was fascinated by the occult,and he belonged to the shadowy Druiden-Orden. Also, De Kay’s and Reventlow’sEuropean supporters included Hungarian statesman and Rosicrucian adept CountAlfred Apponyi, said to have fraternized with the Golden Dawn years earlier.22The Beast was one of the very few operatives who could have recognized andpieced together these tangled threads.In 1917 William Wiseman began a special operation of his own. Soon after thefall of the Tsar, he decided to “guide the storm” in Russia, using money, secretpropaganda and hand-picked agents.23 Doing this from New York, he believed,would obscure the British hand. One of Wiseman’s most important agents in thisgambit was Crowley’s old antagonist, Somerset Maugham. The latter popped up inGotham after his stint for British intelligence in Switzerland helping Nathanchase down Indian seditionists and anarchist assassins. Maugham and Crowleymaintained their enmity, but could not have ignored each other’s presence in NewYork, especially since they had the same boss.In getting the Russian mission from Wiseman, Maugham may again have bagged a jobthat Crowley wanted. The Mage, unlike Maugham, actually had some experience inRussia. Wiseman described one part of his plan as “endeavor[ing] to do in Russiawhat we have done successfully elsewhere; namely to place Germans who areworking for us among the real German agents . . .,” and use persons who “havespecial facilities for getting into the confidence of German agents.”24 One ofWiseman’s concerns was that “the Germans have managed to secure control of themost important secret societies in Russia.”25 “It is necessary that this Germaninfluence should be exposed,” he noted, “and counter-Societies organized, ifnecessary.” Crowley would seem ideal for such duty, but Wiseman perhaps decidedthat the Master Therion was more useful where he was, cultivating the likes ofLavroff, Narodny, and Brasol.Another gap in Crowley’s Magical Record lasts from early September 1918 throughthe rest of his American stay. He remained at 1 University Place until January1919, moving then a few blocks away to 63 Washington Square South. There helived with a new lady-love, Swiss-American Leah Hirsig, whom he dubbed “SororAlostrael” and “The Ape of Thoth.”26On 26 February 1919, the Evening World, again at British collaborator Cosgrave’sinstigation, ran an article lauding Crowley as “Greenwich Village’s latestsensation.”27 The emphasis was on his recent and moderately successfulexhibition of “Dead Souls” paintings. The article drew an un-Bohemian portraitof the Mage, noting his well-tailored clothes and proper manners, both morebefitting a Wall Street banker than a Village artist. It also observed that hisroomy, well-furnished apartment was atypical for the neighborhood. Obviously, heno longer was in the poorhouse.By far the most interesting thing about the article is that Crowley wasunusually candid about his service for Britain. He confessed to having been inthe “confidential service” of the British Government before the war and to havebeen shot in the leg in the line of duty. “He then came to this country, in late1915 [sic, 1914],” the article read, “on a special mission for the British, andlater became editor of The International, a radical magazine published inGreenwich Village.” He did not come right out and say that he was a British spy,and he sidestepped his labors for the Germans. Spinning The International as aradical rag was clear pandering to the pro-Bolshie crowd. He played to the sameaudience by drawing special attention to one of his paintings, Young BolshevikGirl with a Wart Looking at Trotsky. Crowley also pointed out that one of hisfavorite Dead Soul portraits was that of the actress Madame Yorska. The Madamewas an intimate of Hanns Heinz Ewers, who in June 1918 had offered to betray himand his accomplices to the Bureau of Investigation.28 Was Crowley’s portraitintended as a reproach, or a commendation?Aside from his new Scarlet Woman and his painting, Crowley’s chief preoccupationduring early 1919 was arranging publication of a new, third volume of the OTO’sEquinox. Despite the assistance of Charles Stansfield Jones, whom the Mageembraced as his “spiritual son,” it proved hard going. Crowley blamed the“dishonest intrigues of the people in Detroit” who handled the money end.29These were a gaggle of wealthy “high grade freemasons” headed by millionairepublisher Albert W. Ryerson, a star in Detroit’s “bohemian colony” whose“palatial home in aristocratic Grosse Pointe” was a gathering place for thatilk.30 The Equinox business was part of Crowley’s bigger aim, to enlist Ryersonand friends in creating a “Supreme Grand Council” of Masonry. This body would“reorganize” Masonic rites, with the ultimate aim of subordinating them to theOTO.31 The Beast spun visions of a luxurious temple that would make Detroit theMidwestern Paris of esotericism.Like most of Crowley’s schemes, this fizzled. Still, hidden agendas lurked inhis dealings with the Detroit brethren. Ryerson’s contacts in the “bohemiancolony” included members of the local radical crowd. Along with New York andChicago, the Justice Department regarded Detroit as a prime center ofrevolutionary activism. Dealing with Ryerson afforded the Mage a cover for hisongoing work as snoop and informant.Ryerson’s social contacts also included the towering figure of Motor CityMasonry, Henry Ford. While nothing directly ties Ford to the Equinox affair, theMasonic nexus afforded Crowley a conduit to the Great Man. Ford was a devoutFreemason, an avowed believer in reincarnation, and (like his friend ThomasEdison) intrigued by the mysteries of Theosophy.Ford’s politics were as irregular as his metaphysics. When not too busyunion-busting in his plants, he hobnobbed with avowed socialists (e.g., RozikaSchwimmer), subsidized quasi-radical causes (e.g., the abortive Peace Ship) andtook an active interest in revolutionary Russia. In 1918, for instance, Fordbacked a press syndicate whose correspondents included a strange Russian, BorisLeonidovich Tageev, a.k.a. Colonel Roustam Bek. This former Tsarist officer, aveteran of the revolutionary agitation, aligned himself with the Bolsheviksafter the October Revolution. Tageev met several times with Ford after hisarrival in the States, and in early 1919, while Crowley was busy in Detroit,Tageev became military advisor to the new Russian Soviet Government Bureau inNew York. That, moreover, put him in the same circle as Dudley Field Malone.32The Soviet Bureau courted commercial deals with American businessmen, and Fordwas a prime target. Naturally the Soviet Bureau also engaged in propaganda andespionage. Tageev may have played another role as the mysterious “ColonelMalinowsky,” head of the “Bolshevik Secret Service in the U.S.A.”33The Jewish Question that vexed Ford may have given Crowley another angle toexploit. The Flivver King was convinced that German-Jewish bankers were theinvisible hand behind the World War. In early 1919, he found further fertilizerfor his conspiracy theory in the infamous Protocols of the Learned Elders ofZion.34 Boris Brasol, the Russian who put an English translation of Protocols inFord’s hands, we have met before. Brasol was now a special informant to AmericanMilitary Intelligence. His Jew-baiting reports often fell on deaf ears, but hefound Ford receptive. In July 1919, Ford gave an interview to the World in whichhe openly denounced the “International Jew” as the arch-instigator and profiteerof wars and revolutions.35Crowley’s attitude towards Jews was, typically, contradictory, and he wascertainly capable of telling the likes of Ford and Brasol what they wanted tohear. Basically, the Beast held that Jews were inherently decent folk, but thatcenturies of relentless persecution had exaggerated their “worst qualities.”36Thus he could proclaim that Jews in Eastern Europe practiced human sacrifice andthat “Israel has corrupted the whole world, whether by conquest, by conversionor by conspiracy.”37 In 1922 he proposed a convenient means for Jews to regaintheir true will and destiny—the adoption of Thelema as the foundation of a newIsrael.38British and American intelligence reports in this period contain many referencesto the Russian Revolution and Bolshevism as the handiwork of Jewish conspiracy.In early 1920, even Winston Churchill publicly attacked the insidious work of“international . . . atheistic Jews,” whom he distinguished from good“nationalist” (i.e., Zionist) Jews.39 Closer to Crowley, New York’s Section Vreceived and circulated many reports describing the insidious collusion ofJewish revolutionaries and bankers. In March 1917, for instance, Wiseman himselfcabled to London that Trotsky was about to sail for Russia backed by “Jewishfunds . . . behind which are possibly German.”40 Later dispatches from Russia,including Maugham’s, described “Jewish socialists” as the main tools of Germanintrigue in Russia, financed by Jewish financiers such as Max Warburg.In New York, much suspicion centered on Warburg’s friend and ally Jacob Schiffand the two Warburg brothers he employed. Recall that British intelligencegenerally, and Crowley personally, had a friend inside Schiff’s firm, Otto Kahn.In April 1919, Robert Nathan (himself Jewish) sent a “Bolshevist Report” toLondon that warned of “wide and violent” Soviet propaganda in America and of theWilson administration’s dangerous “leniency and even sympathy” towardBolshevism.41 A few months later, a similar report arrived from London’s agentRalph Isham, who headed “A-2,” a secret anti-Bolshevik unit in the British Army.Visiting the U.S. that summer, Isham compiled a report that accused Jacob Schiffof being pro-German during the war (basically true) and a secret benefactor ofthe Soviet regime.42 Tangled in the same net of intrigue was our old friend theBaroness von Seidlitz, ex-Tsarist officials, German revanchists, and, for goodmeasure, Dudley Field Malone. Crowley could have briefed Isham on many of thesetidbits.Also, the Flivver-King maintained his own secret service, manned by ex-APL, BI,and other government agents, some of whom our man may have known. From an officeat Manhattan’s 20 Broad Street, Ford’s detectives carefully watched prominentJews, radicals, and anyone else who raised their suspicions.43 Tapping into thisnetwork would have helped British intelligence discreetly collect anddisseminate information, and disinformation.One propaganda gambit that allegedly received Crowley’s special touch was the“British Secret Document” that surfaced in New York in June 1919. This purportedto be a letter from Sir William Wiseman to Prime Minister Lloyd George outliningan insidious British scheme to turn American citizens into loyal subjects of HisMajesty. The letter detailed a systematic campaign of subversion of everythingfrom the White House and Congress to American religion, press, and popularculture. It was a gross parody of what British propaganda actually had done toshape American opinion, and written by someone familiar with that effort.The document’s reductio ad absurdum recalls Crowley’s calculated ludicrousnesson the pages of The Fatherland, etc. For example, the author notes that the“anglicization” time for the average American had been reduced from 104 days toa mere “29 days, 3 hours, 16 minutes” at the low, low cost of only $0.53 per“colonist.”44 Snide references to the “traditional ignorance” of most Americansand their tendency towards homogeneity, covetousness, and pride echo Crowley’sown observations. Someone noticed the similarities. After consulting with thechief of the U.S. Secret Service in New York, a BI agent reported to Washington,“It is believed that Crowley may be the author of said paper.”45The publisher of the tract, a small firm with Irish Republican connections,attributed the document to an anonymous source. Improbably, an unsignedcarbon-copy supposedly was found lying on the sidewalk near Wiseman’s formeraddress. As though that were not fishy enough, analysis by U.S. NavalIntelligence discovered enough errors and inconsistencies to prove the documenta fraud. Still, only someone with inside knowledge of British intelligencepersonnel and operations could have concocted it. The letter, for instance,identified Gaunt and Nathan’s clandestine “affiliations with the American SecretService.”46Ten years later, Dr. William Maloney stood up to take credit for the document,which he claimed was a “lampoon” of British propaganda. Maloney was a veteranIrish activist and die-hard admirer of Roger Casement. Back when the Documentappeared, however, the Bureau of Investigation knew Maloney as something else, a“British agent.”47 The reasonable conclusion is that Maloney and Crowleyconcocted the Document together, at Wiseman’s behest, to discredit Irishcriticism of British influence.Crowley came again to the attention of American authorities in 1919 through a 4June letter to U.S. Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer. Its anonymous authordeclared, “If you desire to find the mastermind that is secretly directing thebomb outrages . . . look into the doings of Aleister Crowley, 1 UniversityPlace.”48 It accurately pointed out the Beast’s role as an Irish agitator andhis connection to The Fatherland, describing the Mage as “clever and cunning”and the “directing and planning mind behind men of lesser intelligence.” “[He]is more shrewd than any living being,” the letter warned, “[and] a real power ofevil among men.” The writer concluded, “I know absolutely whereof I speak.”Assuming the letter was not Crowley’s own perverse self-promotion, someone hadit in for him who knew about his recent activities. Unfortunately, nothing elsein the files offers a clue to the writer’s identity. The letter struck a rawnerve in Washington. At the beginning of June, mail bombs exploded or weredisarmed in eight U.S. cities—one addressed to Attorney General Palmer, and allsent from the main post office in Manhattan.Then on 9 June the Department of Justice received a letter form Joseph W.Norwood of Louisville, Kentucky. Norwood was secretary of the Louisville-basedInternational Magian Society, who described themselves as “freemasons concernedwith combating pro-German, Bolshevist and radical propaganda.”49 Norwood was aself-proclaimed expert on Masonic symbolism and a student of Oriental occultism.According to Norwood, Crowley had recently contacted his organization offeringconfidential information and other services. The Beast billed himself as “amember of the British Mission to the United States” and confessed that in theemploy of His Majesty’s Secret Service “my main object [was] to bring Americainto the war.”50 Norwood, suspicious of this strange Englishman, asked Justiceto share any information it had on him.The BI, as usual, politely declined the request, but in evaluating it, theyapparently discovered gaps in their files about this peculiar and possiblydangerous man. One wonders, had someone been systematically removing anythingrelated to him? In New York, BI agent O’Donnell got the job of gathering whatinformation he could. This led him to Becker’s Bureau, which admitted to having“a more or less extensive file on the subject.”51 Becker’s men claimed a hardtime locating the file, and it took weeks for O’Donnell to get it, or someredacted version. What O’Donnell saw detailed Crowley’s claims to have workedfor British interests by goading the Germans into “mak[ing] asses of themselves. . . until even the Americans kicked.”52 He also found the comments of anunnamed British official (certainly Guy Gaunt), dismissing the Beast as a“harmless neurotic” who was “never taken seriously.”53 Crowley may reasonablyhave assumed that Becker naturally shared all information about him, and hisassistance, with the Feds. In that he was clearly mistaken.The sudden scrutiny by the federal authorities may have helped Crowley concludethat he needed another magical retreat. So he left Manhattan and “spent thesummer in a tent beyond Montauk at the extremity of Long Island.”54 In the yearssince, Montauk Point and its associated military installations have acquired alively reputation for strange phenomena, and the Great Beast’s sojourn there iscited as evidence of the high weirdness that permeates the place.55 Crowley’sdeclared purpose at Montauk was to build on the success of his recent Workings.But if untroubled mystical contemplation and cool ocean breezes were his goal,Long Island afforded much more secluded spots. Like Esopus Island, hisencampment at Montauk was for more than spiritual exercises.Crowley pitched his tent near one of the most militarized spots on the EastCoast. U.S. military presence around Montauk dated back to the Spanish-AmericanWar. In 1904, the Navy chose the Point for one of its first maritime wirelessstations.56 During WWI, the Army conducted training nearby while the Navy’soutpost grew into a full-fledged Naval Air Station, equipped with seaplanes andthe latest communications equipment. The Army had mostly pulled out by the timeCrowley showed up, but the Navy station was still manned and operating. Indeed,Montauk Naval Air Station was still running as late as November 1919, well afterCrowley’s visit, with a complement of at least a hundred men. Questioned aboutthe slow demobilization, the Navy would only say that the men were staying oftheir own accord.57 In reality the Station was a secret experimental base forhydrophone and ground radio devices, torpedoes, and perhaps other things.58The British Admiralty had a division interested in such technologies, the Boardof Inventions and Research (BIR). In 1917, the BIR had established a presencewithin the British War Mission to the U.S. under the direction of CommanderCyprian C. D. Bridge.59 He was Assistant Secretary of the BIR and the namesakeof Admiral Sir Cyprian Bridge, a past Director of Naval Intelligence. Theyounger Bridge returned to service in 1914 as a naval censor, which put him inthe same branch as Feilding. Bridge moved to the BIR in 1915 and ended up in itsSection II, which dealt with submarines, wireless telegraphy, telephony, andelectrical gizmos, such as the U.S. Navy was developing at Montauk. Bridge hadgood reason to support Crowley’s trip to Montauk, where the Magician might get ahint of what Britain’s new naval rivals were up to.60Other business at the Point included a plan by the American military and privateconcerns for a huge maritime terminal to relieve congestion in New York Harbor.One of the key firms involved was the British Cunard Steamship Line, which, ofcourse, had close ties to the Admiralty. Curiously, Cunard abruptly dropped itsMontauk scheme in July 1919, not long after Crowley arrived.61Crowley’s presence at Montauk may link him to a wizard of a different kind,Nicola Tesla. Tesla, the epitome of the eccentric scientific genius, inventedalternating current, as well as other ideas that challenged prevailing notionsof physics and outstripped the technological means to realize them. PerhapsTesla’s greatest unfulfilled project was the huge tower at Wardenclyffe nearShoreham, Long Island, roughly halfway between New York and Montauk. Tesla sawthe 187-foot-tall, mushroom-shaped structure as a first step in a worldwidecommunications system and, most importantly, a system to generate unlimited,free electric power by tapping the Earth’s own electrical currents. The “free”part eventually discouraged his financial backers, among them J.P. Morgan. As aresult, Tesla was pushed to the edge of financial ruin.When the war started, Tesla had just managed to save Wardenclyffe fromforeclosure by making a deal with his landlord, hotel manager George Boldt.Boldt, though, was associated with a more powerful player, blue-bloodreal-estate mogul (William) Vincent Astor. Astor, furthermore, was a friend andkinsman of Crowley’s frequent host Robert Chanler, and both were relations ofAssistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin Roosevelt. Moreover, Astor was anofficer in the U. S. Naval Reserve and (thanks to cousin Franklin) a member of aspecial branch of the Office of Naval Intelligence.Astor’s outfit got its start in 1916, when Roosevelt directed their mutual IvyLeague pal, Lt. Commander Spencer Eddy, to set up a super-secret operation inNew York that would report directly to FDR. SIS man Norman Thwaites counted Eddyamong those Americans who worked “in close co-ordination and co-operation withthe British Military Intelligence” and who had “taken up with enthusiasm anycases presented to him.”62 So, when a broke Tesla finally handed overWardenclyffe to Boldt in 1916, control really ended up with ONI officer Astor.ONI and the British had good reason to be curious about Tesla. In late 1915, heannounced to the press that he was working on a “destructive invention” thatwould revolutionize warfare by destroying entire fleets with immense bolts ofelectricity.63 The weapon, he claimed, could be operated by a single man “in atower on Long Island.” With Tesla’s track record as an inventor, men inWashington, London, and even Berlin could not have failed to take notice.An ethnic Serb, Tesla was born in Austria-Hungary, Germany’s ally. Although theinventor is not known to have waxed patriotic about his native land or Germany,he had long-standing business connections in Berlin and many Germans among hisassociates, including his personal secretary George Scherff, a close friend ofViereck. Tesla eventually befriended Viereck as well, having probably met himduring WWI.64 Here was a source of information for Crowley, or even a pathwayinto Tesla’s circle. Like Edison, Tesla was intrigued by Theosophy and, like theBeast, he was an admirer of the Hindu mystic Swami Vivekananda.65Astor’s ONI group, and perhaps the British as well, may have schemed to take theWardenclyffe tower from Tesla out of fear that the Germans would get hold of itor its secrets. Since the U.S. government took control of the big DeutscheTelefunken antenna at Sayville, Long Island, in 1915, German agents in theStates had been without a secure wireless link to Berlin. Wardenclyffe offered aviable substitute. In July 1917, the Navy supervised the demolition ofWardenclyffe on the grounds that “German spies were using the big wirelesstower” to communicate with submarines and Germany itself.66Could Crowley and Plummer have used Tesla’s tower to communicate with Steiner“without using any cable or telegraph system in public use”?67 Revealing this tothe Americans would have demonstrated Crowley’s good will to ONI, a chip to becashed in when he camped at Montauk. The first reference to Crowley’s andPlummer’s alleged communications with Berlin appears in an ONI memo dated 10July 1917, exactly when the Navy moved in on Wardenclyffe.Crowley departed Montauk by the end of August. He blamed the place for nastyplantar blisters that plagued him for months to come. The stay also convincedhim “that the current [presumably the magical one] was exhausted. . . . I hadfinished my work in America and began to prepare my escape.”68Still, he seems to have been in no rush. The following month, he again quit NewYork and headed south to spend six weeks with his friends Willie and KateSeabrook on their farm near Atlanta, Georgia. Both the Mage’s and Seabrook’srecollections indicate an entirely personal agenda for the visit, which includedsex-magic workings between Crowley and Kate (Willie liked to watch). Close by,though, lay the forbidding grey edifice of Atlanta Federal Penitentiary,temporary home of Franz Rintelen, Karl von Kleist, and other German operatives.Another recent inmate, released just a few days before the Beast’s arrival, wasEmma Goldman’s lover, Alexander Berkman.While at the Seabrooks’, the Mage was interviewed by the Hearst-controlledAtlanta Journal Sunday Magazine.69 Its editor, Angus Perkerson, emphasizedCrowley’s esoteric side, labeling him “an authority on occultism” who couldteach anyone “how to become a magician,” and evidently took the whole thingrather lightly. The piece resembled the earlier Evening World item, with onenotable exception: it did not mention Crowley’s past work for Britain or anyoneelse.From Atlanta, the Beast sped north to Detroit for more haggling with Ryersonabout The Equinox. The Motor City was then a focus of anti-radical raidslaunched by Palmer’s Justice Department. One target was Alexander Berkman.Detroit also was home to Parke-Davis, Crowley’s peyote connection, where hecould stock up on Anhalonium for his next diversion, a trip into Kentucky’sspectacular Mammoth Cave. That was not far from Louisville, making it easy tocommune with Norwood and the International Magians. Crowley’s overtures toNorwood and friends look like an attempt to hedge his bets with the Ryerson gangor perhaps rope the Magians into his grand Masonic Plan.During late November and early December, the Master Therion was again back inDetroit for more dickering with Ryerson. The Equinox was going badly, and in theend it proved an utter fiasco for everyone, Ryerson above all. He sank about$35,000 of his and others’ money into the project. Beyond this, the “lewdness”of the publication aroused the hostility of local and federal authorities. Laterscandals generated by Ryerson’s serial divorces included lurid public testimonyabout OTO rituals and led to the utter collapse of the Detroit chapter.The Mage’s last visit to Detroit coincided with a local lecture tour by Berkmanand Goldman. Thanks to the relentlessness of Palmer’s underling, J. EdgarHoover, that pair and scores of other radicals now faced deportation. WhenCrowley sailed from New York Harbor, he must have cast a glance at Ellis Island,where Berkman and Red Emma awaited a slow boat to Russia.Those two were not Palmer and Hoover’s only concerns. In mid-December, the BIreceived disturbing intelligence from Detroit that members of the radicalIndustrial Workers of the World, including many auto workers, were armingthemselves against expected “interference in their activities by the AmericanLegion.”70 Crowley could have tapped Ryerson’s bohemian contacts, or Ford’speople, to investigate the rumors.In Confessions, The Mage recalls reaching home “a few days before Christmas,”and that is confirmed by a diary entry placing him at his Aunt’s house inCroydon on 25 December.71 About the timing and method of return , however, he isartfully vague. The Atlantic crossing generally took at least a week, oftenlonger in winter. Relatively few passenger ships were sailing from New York toBritish ports at this season, and only two fit Crowley’s timeline: the Imperatorand the smaller Lapland. The first ship left Gotham on 11 December; the Lapland,two days later. Both reached England on 21 December.Crowley probably took passage on the Imperator. Not only did it offer betteraccommodations, no small issue to the Mage, but it also was faster. The liner’shistory also may have piqued Crowley’s curiosity or perversity. The Imperatorwas German, a former flagship of the Hamburg-America Line. Having sat out thewar mired in a north German estuary, she was requisitioned by the Americans tobring soldiers home. In August 1919, Washington turned the liner over to theBritish shipping board, which then handed it to Cunard as a replacement for thelong-sunk Lusitania.72 Crowley, having come to America on that vessel, returnedto Blighty on her replacement. Neither Crowley’s name nor any obvious aliasappears on the Imperator’s manifest. The Lapland’s is lost, and no trace of himappears on any passenger list bound for Britain that December.Again, he was using some alias. The 1916 MI5 notification to all British portsthat he be “searched and sent Metropolitan Police, London” might still cause himtrouble. On the other hand, Crowley’s name is absent from an MI5 blacklistcompiled in 1918. Had Kell’s people been warned off? The nosy press were abigger worry. Crowley and his employers had good cause to keep his name out ofthe papers. The likes of Horatio Bottomley could be counted upon to raise holyhell if they caught scent of the Beast, now that he had added cheerleading forGermany to his already appalling résumé.To get quietly into England, Crowley needed help. His 1914 passport had expired,and wartime regulations still in effect demanded he have one. Thus, he must havecarried a new passport or visa. The only place he could get one of those was thePassport Control Office in New York. Of course, he had connections there.Also attesting to the secrecy of Crowley’s exit is that in January 1920 Americanofficials still believed him to be on their soil. A 7 January memo to BI’s J.Edgar Hoover assured that Crowley was still in the U.S.A.73 This was based onthe promise, attributed to unnamed British officials, that the Beast would bearrested and prosecuted the moment he set foot in England. On 30 January, JohnHurley of the State Department wrote to the BI chief in New York asking for newsof Crowley’s plans to return to the U.K.74 Hurley believed that Crowley washiding in the States to avoid certain prosecution, and he thought it best tofind him and “keep an eye on him.” By this time, however, Crowley was long gonefrom America, and from England as well.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 WWP, 6/172, New York, October 7, 1917,” 2.2 MID, 9771-56, “My Dear Churchill,” c.

"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ELEVEN [../Text/contents.html] 043 [../Images/00002.jpg] THE UNWELCOME GUEST044 [../Images/00002.jpg] ON CHRISTMAS DAY 1919, CROWLEY BEGAN A NEW DIARY WITH A DESCRIPTION OF HISHOLIDAY REPAST, complete with plum pudding and brandy, at Aunt Annie’s house inCroydon. Fortunately, German zeppelins had not acted on his suggestion to bombit. This cheery gathering shows that he still had friends in England, and thathis homecoming was known to a few. The Beast remained, lying low, for about twoweeks, then quietly slipped across the Channel to France.Meanwhile he had busied himself (he claimed) trying reorganize OTO affairs inLondon. The main aim was to get his hands on any remaining funds. As ever, heprotested poverty, but just as usual he managed to pay for travel and amenities.For instance, while in London, he visited a Harley Street doctor to secure aprescription for heroin. While he had used heroin and other opiates ritually orrecreationally, he now sought the drug to alleviate his asthma that flared upduring the last months in America. Heroin helped the ailment, but at the priceof turning the Mega Therion into its slave.Outwardly, British officials completely ignored the Beast’s return. Crowleyinsisted that he went straight to Scotland Yard and proclaimed, “here I am—ifyou have anything against me, I am perfectly willing to meet any charges. Theysimply laughed at the idea.”1 This contradicts the later account of Frenchwriter Pierre Mariel, who asserts that Crowley faced a “long interrogation” uponhis arrival.2 Both could be versions of the truth. One purpose of Crowley’sbrief and discreet visit must have been a debriefing, and that doubtlessinvolved lengthy questioning. But he faced no charges or apparent reprimand forhis actions in America. On the other hand, neither did he receive publicacknowledgment or reward for his loyal service.Crowley’s treatment again contrasts starkly with that of fellow British subjectand pro-German propagandist I.T. Trebitsch-Lincoln. Hauled back to England andtossed in jail, he got out in 1919 only to face immediate expulsion from thecountry. The lion did not forgive or forget. Even Frank Harris fared worse thanour man. Harris’ Germanophile effusions excited public condemnation during thewar, while Crowley’s writings, at least as provocative, elicited almost nomention in the British press. Likewise, while Crowley met no official obstaclesto his presence in postwar England, Harris felt persona non grata and never setfoot there again.Some, of course, were not so indulgent of Crowley’s indiscretions. A few daysafter he left London, his old enemy Horatio Bottomley learned of his presence inFrance and launched an attack in the pages of John Bull. During the war,Bottomley had wrapped his pugnacious moralizing in a thick layer of jingoism,lambasting anyone he deemed less devoted to King and Country than himself. Healso pursued profitable sidelines—lucrative lectures, for example, and shadybond schemes. Bottomley, despite his police and intelligence connections, had noinkling that Crowley had already come and gone.In “Another Traitor Trounced,” which ran on 10 January, Bottomley railed againstthat “traitorous degenerate, Aleister Crowley,” who was “anxious to sneak backto the land he has sought to defile.” The piece lumped him with Frank Harris andmade special note of Crowley’s association with Viereck, “one of Dernburg’sagents.” Thus Bottomley revealed some acquaintance with Crowley’s Germanassociations and treasonous prose. He took particular offense at theInternational article praising Reventlow’s Vampire of the Continent. “Can such adirty renegade be permitted to return to the country he has spurned andinsulted?,” Bottomley asked, demanding “assurance from the Home Office or theForeign Office that steps are being taken to arrest the renegade or prevent hisinfamous feet ever again touching our shores.” Crowley and Harris, Bottomleyconcluded, were “dangerous firebrands,” and their presence in England or Ireland“would involve perilous consequences.” It was “the duty of the Government [to] .. . take effective action” against these miscreants. The Government obviouslyignored Bottomley’s advice, but the diatribe must have convinced some thatCrowley had best remain scarce. The Mage would not again return to England untilBottomley was safely disgraced and headed for jail.When Bottomley’s attack appeared, Crowley was sitting in Paris, awaiting twoimportant reunions. His faithful and very pregnant Scarlet Woman, Leah Hirsig,was coming from Switzerland, where she had been staying with family. The Beasthad packed her off to Europe shortly before his own departure, possibly as adiversion. The other meeting was with Everard Feilding, back from the MiddleEast and now involved in sensitive negotiations about that volatile region.Feilding also stepped back into his role as Crowley’s intermediary withhigher-ups in London. No doubt he offered the Beast a helping hand and, aboveall, kept him quiet.French occultist Georges Monti, later known as “Count Israel,” also appeared atCrowley’s side soon after his arrival in France. Monti had been secretary to thelate and venerable Josephin Sar Peledan, a leading light of FrenchRosicrucianism and the Gnostic Catholic Church. Peledan knew Reuss and had somedealings with the OTO, and Monti apparently wanted to pick up where his masterleft off. In years following, Monti formed his own order, the Groupe Occidentald’Études Ésotériques, but he also claimed to be Crowley’s special “Frenchrepresentative.”3 On the other hand, Monti had a reputation as a charlatan andliar. It was even rumored that Monti, a serial joiner of esoteric societies, wassomeone’s spy. French intelligence could have used him to feel out or watchCrowley.Another accusation is that Monti was an agent of Jesuits.4 As we will see,persons connected to that Order would take a special interest in theself-proclaimed Great Beast. Monti definitely was linked to two secretiveCatholic societies, the Solidatium Pianum, a kind of counter-subversive service,and the mysterious Hieron du Val d’Or. Solidatium Pianum theoretically ceased toexist around 1921, but Hieron lasted longer. Its chief aim was a“reconciliation” between the Church and Freemasonry or, perhaps more accurately,the infiltration and reorganization of Freemasonry for Rome’s benefit.5 Thissmacks a little of Crowley’s dealings with Ryerson and the Detroit Masons andhis strange wartime interest in Catholic conversion. Stranger still, both Hieronand Monti connected to a later secret society, the shadowy and controversialPriory of Sion. They even had links to extreme rightist groups such as ActionFrançaise and assorted Gallic fascists. At the very least, Monti was atrafficker in information, a useful sort for Agent Crowley to know.6Bottomley’s insults, coming from a man the Beast despised as a crook andpoltroon, got under Crowley’s skin. What most bothered him was being unable torespond. He recalled conjuring up a lengthy retort to Bottomley’s smear butdecided, likely on Feilding’s advice, not to publish it.7 He also compiled alist of persons who could be summoned as character witnesses to rebutBottomley’s libels. These included Feilding, John Cosgrave, Somerset Maugham,John Quinn, and other intelligence-related contacts.8 Not long after, the Beastbegan a first draft of what would become “The Last Straw,” a meandering accountof his time in America that eventually became an appendix in Confessions.Crowley explained his willingness to submit in “silence” to Bottomley’scalumnies because he hoped “to make myself again useful to England in a similarcapacity if certain eventualities, which I then thought not impossible, shouldmaterialise.”9 In other words, he was anticipating a new mission that mightrequire the same treasonous façade.“Eventualities” probably alluded to events brewing in Germany. There thefledgling Weimar Republic struggled to hold power in the face of violentopposition from Moscow-backed Communists and revanchist proto-Nazis. The onlyquestion seemed to be which band of extremists would seize control first. Mixedup in the chaotic and murky plotting were the familiar Americanoccultist-financier John de Kay, the anglophobe Count Reventlow, inveterateconspirator Trebitsch-Lincoln, and even Berlin’s former chief saboteur in NorthAmerica, Kurt Jahnke. Crowley, thus, could be a potentially useful asset to tossinto the fray. Such a mission also would conform to the Mage’s long-standingdesire to work in Germany. For whatever reasons, that did not happen.Perhaps things simply moved too fast. The German unrest flared up in March 1920,when right-wing Freikorps troops seized Berlin in the abortive Kapp Putsch.10British agents hovered around these events, including Gaunt and NormanThwaites.11 The latter kept a watchful eye on Trebitsch, now press secretary ofthe putschists.The Beast spent the next couple of months cooling his heels in Fontainebleau,just south of Paris. He set up a cozy ménage-à-trois with Leah and a youngFrench woman, Ninette Shumway, and their two young sons. Ninette took on therole of nursemaid when Hirsig gave birth to a baby girl, Anne Leah or “Poupée,”in late February. Fontainebleau, especially the nearby forêt, had a longassociation with witchcraft and black magic. Soon after Crowley moved on,Russian mystic George Gurdjieff chose Fontainebleau for his new headquarters.During these weeks Crowley got the idea of establishing his own “college ofoccult knowledge.” For its campus he looked to warmer climes, and on 1 March,the I Ching directed him to sunny Sicily. Traveling via Naples, Crowley andNinette arrived in the sleepy seaside town of Cefalu, about fifty miles east ofPalermo, at the beginning of April. Dominated by dramatic rock outcroppings, theplace had little to recommend it besides good weather and cheap living. Crowleyproclaimed it his New Jerusalem. Leah and Poupée arrived in mid-April. As“Countess Lea Harcourt” and “Sir Alastor de Kerval,” she and Crowley signed alease on the Villa Santa Barbara, a vacant farmhouse outside town. Whether thismasquerade was a playful joke or a serious attempt to disguise themselves isunclear. Crowley dubbed the six-room house the “Abbey of Thelema” and envisionedit as a utopian community of students and adepts that would spread his teachingsacross the globe. The actual result was a hippie commune ahead of its time,complete with free love, abundant drugs, and poor sanitation.Undoubtedly factors other than an I Ching hexagram influenced the choice ofCefalu. Sicilians had abounded in Crowley’s beloved New Orleans, many fromCefalu.12 Intelligence considerations played their part as well. According toone dubious story, Crowley’s relocation to Cefalu followed an agreement with theFrench secret service to keep a watch on Italian naval movements.13 If the Beasthad been put on the shelf by London, a deal with the French might have madesense, especially with a growing household to support. The Abbey afforded anexcellent view of local waters and easy access by train to Palermo and its navalbase. That base would have been a main staging area for any Italian navaloperation in the Mediterranean, especially against nearby French-controlledTunisia. Like Germany, postwar Italy was politically volatile, seething withresentment over the postwar division of spoils.Crowley’s skimpy Deuxième Bureau file provides no clues about whether the Frenchengaged him as an agent. It contains only the previously noted 1916 Britishreport on Crowley’s pro-Irish (but not his pro-German) antics and two extractsfrom the French press about his 1929 expulsion. Those articles do mention hiswork for the Germans in wartime America, but they also include his claim to havebeen working for England. A copy of the original French index card attached tothe file merely describes the Beast as an “Agitatuer irlandais.”14French intelligence should have had much more information on such acontroversial figure and longtime resident of France. The dossier might oncehave been fatter. In 1940, the invading Germans took all the French intelligencefiles they could get their hands on, including Crowley’s, to Berlin. When Berlinfell to the Red Army in 1945, the victorious Soviets stashed the same files aswar booty in Moscow’s “Special Archive.” There Crowley’s file remained untilrepatriated with many others in the 1990s. The French, the Nazis, and theSoviets had ample opportunity to remove or lose material from the file.However, Crowley was most likely spying at Cefalu, not for the French, but onthem, and for the British. He also kept tabs on the Italians. Feilding’s was theguiding hand that steered Crowley to where he could pursue his mystical designsand still be of use to His Majesty. Before returning to Europe in mid- 1919,Feilding had been in Syria, a territory recently handed over to Frenchadministration. The Anglo-French division of the Middle East was fraught withsuspicion on both sides, and London was particularly concerned about the Frenchmilitary resources pouring into Syria. From his base in Sicily Crowley maderegular trips to French-controlled Tunisia, the main staging area and logisticalhub for French forces in the Levant.While at Cefalu, Crowley started work on a new novel, Diary of a Drug Fiend.Among its characters was a British consul in Naples, a fair-minded, “tall,bronzed Englishman” who helps the protagonists out of a jam with localauthorities. His inspiration was Walter Alexander Smart, a career diplomat whoserved at the Consulate-General in New York from early 1917 to summer 1919.Smart also worked in a vague capacity at the Foreign Office during 1915,possibly intelligence-related. Most of his career had been spent in North Africaand the Middle East, experience that meshed with Feilding’s. Smart took a newpost in French-controlled Damascus not long after Crowley set up camp at Cefalu.French writer Xavier de Hauteclocque, who had close ties to Paris’ secretservices, identified Smart as the British agent who later instigated theanti-French uprising of Syrian Druze tribesmen.15 Any information Crowley pickedup in Tunis or Palermo about the strength and deployment of French forces wouldhave keenly interested Smart and others.Crowley’s enemies in the British press inadvertently revealed another link inthis nexus, the Beast’s association with His Majesty’s Consul in Palermo,Reginald Gambier MacBean. Their acquaintance predated the War. The Consul’soccult affiliations most notably included Annie Besant’s wing of Theosophy andits attendant Order of the Star of the East. MacBean’s devotion to Besant, anoutspoken proponent of Indian freedom, created ripples in the Foreign Office. In1917, MacBean nearly resigned after he inappropriately sent a letter praisingBesant through the diplomatic post to a “friend” in America.16 That friend wasprobably Crowley.MacBean also was the newly-minted Grand Master of the Antient and Primitive Riteof Memphis-Misraim for Italy.17 The Memphis-Misraim order suddenly reappeared inItaly in 1921, perhaps midwifed by Crowley in Cefalu. Memphis-Misraim being aconstituent of the Ordo Templi Orientis, MacBean’s familiarity with Reuss andCrowley suggests that he may have been OTO too. Beyond this, Crowley was anhonorary member of the Rito Filosofico Italiano, another fringe Masonic group towhich MacBean belonged. Thus the Consul and Crowley had a wide basis forcollaboration, and the Palermo Consulate was an ideal information conduit toFeilding, Smart, and London.The Crowley-MacBean connection had other advantages. Like any diligenttotalitarian, Mussolini disliked secret societies, and in late 1922 he began tocrack down on everything from the Masons to the Mafia. The antipathy was mutual.Italian Masonic and Theosophist circles teemed with informants and operativeshostile to the Fascist regime, and collecting information from them was part ofCrowley’s job.Pierre Mariel, a longtime collaborator of the French Army’s intelligence arm(the Service de renseignements) also alleged espionage by Crowley in Sicily.18Mariel claimed to have seen a file unflatteringly detailing the Mage’sactivities as a secret agent. London, he said, had deemed Crowley a “ratherinept” agent whose chronic inability to manage money and “moral corruption”necessitated “the very greatest caution” if he was to be used.19Again, there maybe more than a grain of truth to that.Over the next year, the little colony at Cefalu attracted such acolytes asCrowley’s Cambridge friend, the mathematician Norman Mudd, and a minor leagueAmerican film star, Jane Wolfe. Ninette Shumway’s two sisters, Helene and Mimi,also joined the faithful. The truth about the Abbey fell somewhere betweenCrowley’s idealized portrait of it as an almost puritanical assembly ofspiritual seekers and the cesspool of blasphemy, depravity, and drug-crazedlicentiousness later portrayed in the press. Drugs abounded, and the Mage’s andLeah’s heroin use mushroomed into full-blown addiction.Things at the Abbey started to take a bad turn as early as October 1920 with thedeath of Crowley’s and Hirsig’s infant daughter, Poupée. Both parents took theloss hard, but Leah’s miscarriage a few days later pushed her into a deepdepression and further under the spell of the needle. Crowley escaped on tripsto Naples, Tunis, and Paris, staying in the City of Light during February-March1921. That trip included an early attempt to wean himself from dope.In February 1922, Crowley, with Leah in tow, began an extended vacation from thegrowing mess at the Abbey. They first ensconced themselves in a small hotel inParis’s Montparnasse, where they struggled to kick their habit. The Beast,however, was very anxious to get to London, as if summoned there. His firstattempt to go, on 14 February, ran into a strange obstacle. French authoritiesin the Channel port of Boulogne stopped him on the alleged suspicion that he wasa fugitive English businessman, Mr. Bevan. Crowley later passed off the incidentas simple mistaken identity. Others have claimed it was a ruse by the Frenchsecret service so they could consult with him discreetly about Italianmatters.20 That seems unlikely, but there definitely was more going on than metthe eye.The elusive Gerard Lee Bevan was a prominent London stockbroker who had fled toFrance to escape financial ruin and accusations of embezzlement. As yet,however, Bevan faced no formal charge, was not a fugitive, and was not missing.The day Crowley was stopped, The Times noted Bevan’s presence in Paris andpredicted his imminent return to London. The French had no charge against Bevan,and the British police had every reason to want him back home. Bevan, however,had made noises about going “south.” Several days later he vanished from Paris,soon reappearing in Naples, a short journey by boat from Cefalu.21This raises the possibility that the French police or Scotland Yard smelledcollusion between Bevan and Crowley. The Beast, as ever, was short of money. Thestockbroker might have tried to buy sanctuary at the Abbey, and Crowley’sjourney to London could have been a scheme to retrieve some of Bevan’s valuableartworks, much as he may have done for Alvensleben.A more likely explanation, however, is that Scotland Yard used the French toturn Crowley back toward Paris to spy on Bevan. The latter was a sibling ofEdwyn Bevan, an acquaintance of Crowley’s old chum Commander Marston (whocarried on an affair with Edwyn B.’s wife). So, it is possible that the Beastand fugitive Bevan had met before. In any case, after briefly returning toParis, Crowley proceeded unmolested to London.Crowley remained in Britain for several months, keeping a low profile andcausing no hue or cry in the press or elsewhere. He used the time, in part, towork on his American memoir, “The Last Straw.” His old tormentor Bottomleyrecently had been convicted and, like Bevan (who perhaps not coincidentally knewBottomley), was prison-bound. Still, Bottomley was not the only enemy of theBeast, and his visit must have had some measure of discreet official protectionto go without protestedIn London, Crowley reconnected with an old acquaintance, Austin Harrison, editorof The English Review. The Beast pseudonymously contributed some pieces to it,including “The Jewish Problem Restated.” Crowley’s renewed interest in theJewish Question happily coincided with his reunion with another friend, New Yorkfinancier Otto Kahn. He was offering his backing to a plan to merge thefinancially troubled English Review with another publication and proposed tosend Crowley back to Gotham to run it.That scheme fell through, but Crowley’s encounter with Kahn may hint at somelarger design. Kahn had come to dominate the formerly Germanophile Kuhn, Loebupon Jacob Schiff’s recent death. Furthermore he had recruited none other thanSir William Wiseman into the firm, and Wiseman had accompanied Kahn to London.All in all, it was quite a little reunion. Wiseman’s new job was arranging loansin restive Central Europe. As his chief troubleshooter, Sir William employed yetanother former (?) British operative, Sidney Reilly. SIS had formally dumpedReilly and supposedly viewed him as untrustworthy and dangerous.22 Similardoubts shadowed Wiseman.About this time, a “reform element” in British intelligence, suspicious ofWiseman’s wartime activities and loyalties, was secretly investigating him.23 Atthe same time, SIS began poking into Reilly’s wartime activities, especially hisrelations with German firms and agents.24 The suspicion was that Reilly andWiseman, as agents for New York bankers, were working against British interests,perhaps channeling money to the cash-hungry Soviets and bankrolling politicalunrest from India to Italy.25 Was Kahn eyeing the Beast for some part in this,or was the “reform element” using Crowley to probe the Kahn-Wiseman circle?If the latter, “Blinker” Hall likely had a hand in it. After the Armistice, Hallresigned his post as Director of Naval Intelligence but continued clandestinework. Hall and Basil Thomson, chief of Scotland Yard, were obsessed with theCommunist menace and unsure of MI5’s inability to deal with it.26 Hall offeredhis expertise to right-wing groups such as the British Empire Union and theEconomic League to wage clandestine war on the Reds. Close to Hall personallyand politically was yet another of Crowley’s old intelligence bosses, Guy Gaunt.Like Hall, Gaunt had officially retired from naval service, but his namecontinued to pop up in intelligence matters.27 To round out this cabal, NormanThwaites also collaborated with Hall while running his own private intelligencebureau.28Two new figures involved with this right-wing nexus were Col. John Filis Carre(J.F.C.) Carter, Assistant Commissioner of Scotland Yard’s Special Branch, andan up-and-coming young spy, Charles Henry Maxwell Knight. Both would come toknow and use Crowley some years later, which does not rule out an earlierintroduction. The Master Therion would have fit right into Hall’s operation—asalways, unofficially and as an informant and provocateur among the Reds.In July 1922, Crowley finally finished Diary of a Drug Fiend, which he countedon for much-needed revenue. It disappointed in that regard, but it did ignite afresh anti-Crowley frenzy in the British press. In September, the Sunday Expressfired the first salvo against the book and its author. By November, the Expresswas calling for the banning of the book, and it savaged Crowley’s character withthe article “Orgies in Sicily.”29 Castigating him as a ringmaster of “paganorgies” and corrupter of morals, the author took a cue from Bottomley by rakingup Crowley’s pro-German writings in America, the Rites of Eleusis scandal, andeven his alleged bilking of a female devotee. For good measure, he added thefalsehood that Crowley had penned a “defeatist manifesto” circulated in Francein 1915. The author, the Express’s straitlaced literary editor James Douglas,expressed his amazement that the villain had been living in London, skulkingamong a “small circle of initiates.”Crowley missed the story, having hurried back to Sicily in October at the urgingof “friends.” Rather than catch a boat from Nice or Marseille, he took the trainstraight through Italy, then on the edge of revolution and civil war. Fasciststrongman Benito Mussolini had marshaled his Blackshirts and was threatening tomarch on Rome. The Beast just happened to be on hand when the King and hisministers caved in to Mussolini’s bullying and named him to lead a newGovernment. Our man also had a front-row seat when the triumphant Il Ducemarched into the Eternal City on 30 October.While Crowley made occasional approving sounds about Fascism, he despisedMussolini as a bombastic opportunist who sold his soul to the Catholic Church.30Still, Crowley and his little band of foreign eccentrics hardly constituted athreat to Il Duce. Or did they? Two fresh faces at the Abbey in fall 1922 werethe poet Frederick “Raoul” Loveday and his lover Betty May. Betty instantlydisliked the place and its fat, bald master, but Raoul lapped it all up,ultimately too eagerly. May later said that he died from drinking cat’s blood insome obscene ritual. The apparent cause of Loveday’s death in February 1923 wascholera, contracted from the local water. The same bacterium also laid Crowleylow.Returning to England, Betty raised a new alarm about the beastliness going on inSicily. About the same time, Ninette Shumway’s sister Helene turned up at theBritish Consulate in Palermo spinning more tales of depravity at the Abbey. InLondon, John Bull leapt to virtue’s defense in early March with the polemics“The King of Depravity,” “A Wizard of Wickedness,” and the classic “TheWickedest Man in the World.”31 The series was a lurid and largely imaginaryexposé of Crowley’s exploitation of women and children and his “cesspool ofvice” in Cefalu. The paper insinuated that the Beast had corrupted Italianofficials and the British Consul in Palermo, and demanded that the Home Officeor Rome prosecute the scoundrel and snuff out his “contaminating influence.” Thefinal installment on 24 March boasted that “it is understood that the ItalianGovernment are resolved to put an end to Crowley’s career of vice. . . .” Amonth later, Italian authorities presented the Abbey’s master with a notice ofexpulsion.The common assumption has been that, if the Loveday scandal and the pressattacks did not force Mussolini to eject Crowley, they helped. Crowley laterclaimed that “no reason was given, no accusations made” by the Italians.32 Hesuspected “backstairs intrigue,” but does not name any suspects. Writer MarcoPasi suspects British authorities, including Consul MacBean, of activelyencouraging the expulsion.33 Some were surely eager to see the embarrassingCrowley leave, but fellow Mason MacBean actually seems to have tipped off theBeast to the imminent arrival of Italian authorities. Certainly someone did.34 Acontributing factor may have been the expected arrival in Cefalu of MonsignorRoncalli, the future Pope John XXIII.A dossier in the Central State Archive in Rome yields intriguing details aboutCrowley’s expulsion.35 Inquiries about the suspicious Englishman commenced inJuly 1922, months before the Fascists came to power. The expulsion order appliedto him exclusively and came from the Ministry of Internal Affairs on 13 April1923, to take effect on 1 May. Its official justification was Crowley’s “obsceneand perverted” sexual activity, including polygamy. The others at the Abbey werefree to remain and continue their orgies; the Italians were not bothered by thealternative lifestyles, just by Crowley. Mussolini’s men believed that he was upto something besides mere vice, but they could not prove it.The key likely was a Sicilian nobleman and prominent politician, GiovanniAntonio Colonna, Duca di Cesaro, then a non-Fascist member of Mussolini’scabinet. He also was an enemy of Il Duce, who would boot Cesaro from theGovernment in 1924. Cesaro also was deep into the Italian occult scene. He was aTheosophist, a follower of Rudolf Steiner, and associated with various esotericMasonic groups.36 He knew MacBean well and would not have ignored the presencein his backyard of a man like Crowley. The merest suspicion that the EnglishMagician and the dissident Duke were in cahoots would have moved Mussolini toact. The British moral panic merely provided a handy excuse.In 1927, Il Duce’s new political police (OVRA) revisited the Crowley case inresponse to one of the many attempts to assassinate Mussolini. The would-bekiller, who only managed to graze the Dictator’s nose, was an Irish-Britishwoman, Violet Gibson.37 Italian authorities eventually deemed her deranged anddeported her to Ireland, but suspicions lingered that she had been a pawn insome larger plot.According to Italian author Claudio Mauri, she was, and the conspiracy involveda murky cabal of occultists and spies.38 Violet Gibson was another Theosophistand, like Crowley’s friend MacBean, a devoted follower of Annie Besant. Amongher Italian acquaintances was the Duca di Cesaro. These connections were enoughto excite the suspicions of any decent policeman. Mussolini’s cops hauled inCesaro for questioning, but he steadfastly denied any involvement. It seemspossible that Gibson was acting on post-hypnotic suggestion, and Crowley, inleague with Cesaro, may have had a hand in preparing her.The London-based Tavistock Clinic, or Tavistock Institute of Medical Psychiatry,might have figured in such a conspiracy.39 Founded about 1920, it generallyfocused on the treatment of shell-shock and related psychological damage fromthe World War. Tavistock’s methodology embraced Freudian and Adlerianpsychoanalysis. We will learn about Crowley’s admiration of Alfred Adler a bitlater. Later rumors held that Tavistock had a more secret and sinister function,as a laboratory for brain-washing and mind-control research serving theintelligence and military branches.40 If it did, the Beast’s experience withpsychoactive drugs would have been invaluable. What, after all, became of TheCactus, Crowley’s lost dissertation on the wonders of mescaline? The Mage wassupposed to be living quietly in Paris at the time or Gibson’s attempt, but hecould easily have slipped back to Rome using old tricks and new documents.French mystic Rene Guenon believed that the Theosophists served Britishintelligence, and some in OVRA seem to have believed the same. Papers seized bythe Italians at the Abbey showed that it had been used as a center forpropaganda against Fascism and Italy. More importantly, OVRA identifiedmaterials from the “special espionage service (servizio speciale di spionnagio)of the British Foreign Office.”41 The Beast had been up to his old tricks. Itappeared that someone, most likely MacBean, was supplying him with informationto guide his inquiries and observations.Perhaps there were other spies among the devout at Cefalu. Crowley casuallymentions the arrival of two Oxford men at the Abbey, Pinney and Bosanquet, theday before he received the expulsion notice.42 In any case, for the Mage oranyone else to leave intelligence-related materials lying about for the Italiansto find was a serious breach of tradecraft, one that might account for the“inept” label Mariel says he saw. Perhaps Crowley expected other operatives totidy up and carry on the secret work, or maybe he was just too stoned to noticeor care.Some blame may rest on the slim shoulders of Ninette Shumway. Next to Leah, whoaccompanied Crowley into exile, Ninette was an old and presumably trustworthyassociate. Since the Italians were unlikely to notice her, she had safe pocketsfor secret papers. However, abandoned by the Beast and destitute, she ultimatelymay have surrendered the papers or bartered them for a ticket home.Meantime, back in England, others were looking at Crowley with the blackestsuspicion. At the center of this was George Makgill, a friend of Bottomley and afellow super-patriot. Makgill ran a private intelligence outfit, Section D, forthe British Empire Union and the Economic League.43 That endeared him toScotland Yard, MI5, the British Fascisti, and even Admiral Hall. In addition tobattling subversives, Makgill “also devoted a considerable amount of time tounmasking the cult of evil of which Aleister Crowley, alias ‘The Beast’, was thecentre.”44 He linked Crowley to “international traffic in drugs and the trafficin women and children.” One of Makgill’s agents, designated “H,” allegedly“uncovered a blackmail plot, involving two well-known politicians, connected toCrowley’s activities in the island of Cefalu [sic].”45By 1922-1923, Makgill had gotten close to members of Britain’s budding Fascistmovement. One of these home-grown Blackshirts was Capt. Arthur L. Rogers, OBE, aformer intelligence officer in the Middle East and a self-proclaimed expert on“Black Magic and extreme left-wing activities.”46 Another of this set was thepreviously cited Nesta Webster, a close friend of both Makgill and Rogers. Her1923 opus Secret Societies and Subversive Movements includes a thinly disguisedattack on Crowley and his influence.47 Also, one of her brothers was Edwyn Bevanwho was, as noted, connected to Crowley’s friend Guy Marston. Bevan also servedas a wartime Propaganda and Ministry of Information officer and may have beenable to provide sis a little inside information. Her other brother was GerardLee Bevan, the very man Crowley was “mistaken” for in 1922.For the most part, Makgill’s obsession with the Mage was a personal affair.Around 1923, however, a curious note appears at the bottom of an MI5 report on aBritish Fascist informant inside the Soviet mission: “note for Don on A.Crowley.”48 It could refer to another A. Crowley, but that seems very doubtful.“Don” doubtless refers to Makgill’s son, Donald, closely linked to the Fascists.It might seem inconsistent for Crowley to be under acute suspicion by acollaborator of Admiral Hall, if the latter had the Beast in his employ.Actually it would have been a repeat of the wartime situation, in whichCrowley’s true allegiance was known only to a privileged few. Just as a generalbelief that he was a German tool made him all the more convincing to theGermans, the conviction of Makgill and his ilk that Crowley was a depraved andseditious monster insulated him against other doubts.The months following Crowley’s departure from Sicily were a low point in hislife, and arguably the beginning of a long, irreversible decline. He and Leahfirst ended up in Tunisia, where they wasted months shooting dope while theBeast worked on Confessions and cooked up the occasional magical working.Obviously he had some means of support. It may be significant that he soughtrefuge on French territory and would mostly remain in France for some timethereafter, not setting foot in England for some years. Perhaps his failure inSicily made him persona non grata; or perhaps he had committed some other sin.At the close of 1923, the Beast and Leah surfaced in Paris, broke and strungout. Truly destitute, Crowley got help from his old friend in magic andconspiracy Frank Harris, who had likewise drifted back to Paris. He mooched offHarris for weeks, but eventually found a new meal ticket and Scarlet Woman, therich American expatriate Dorothy Olsen (Soror Astrid). Poor Leah he cruelly castadrift to find her own way in the world and out of addiction. Through late 1923and early 1924, the Beast returned to writing and magic with something like hisold vigor. He even dragged the hard-drinking Olsen back to Tunisia on a coupleof ill-conceived expeditions.During 1924, Crowley suddenly reappeared in Fontainebleau, where he had holed upwith Hirsig and Ninette Shumway after his return from the States. The attractionwas the presence of Gurdjieff and his “Institute for the Harmonious Developmentof Man.” After fleeing the Bolsheviks to Constantinople, the wily Gurdjieff madehis way to France, where he now ran a more successful version of Crowley’sAbbey. Once again allegedly guided by the I Ching, the Beast paid one “brief,unwelcome visit” on Gurdjieff’s domain.49 “How he gained entry,” writesGurdjieff’s biographer James Moore, “is a mystery.” In any case, Gurdjieff soonsent the “noxious guest” away, and that, so far as Moore and most others areconcerned, was the end of the matter.50As with Cefalu, there was more to Crowley’s appearance at Gurdjieff ’s door thanthe I Ching. Gurdjieff has been alleged to have had his own ties to London’ssecret services. One of his key lieutenants at Fontainebleau was John GodolfinBennett. When Gurdjieff arrived in Constantinople in 1921, Bennett was there asa British officer assigned to “special duties.”51 He offered his help toGurdjieff and soon became a trusted devotee. Bennett was undoubtedly anintelligence officer, but whether he served the military, SIS, or some otherentity is unclear; nearly every type of British spook was active inConstantinople at the time. By the time the Beast appeared at Gurdjieff’s door,however, both the Foreign Office and MI5 had soured on Bennett. They viewed himas a shady character mixed up with the late Turkish Sultan and with a familiarschemer, John De Kay. In fact, Bennett was married to De Kay’s secretary. MI5believed Bennett to be in league with the Turkish secret service and, moreominously, “to be violently anti-British and have communist associates.”52Crowley’s errand at Fontainebleau likely included sniffing around for whatGurdjieff and his pal Bennett were up to. Did someone in London put him up toit, or was he spying on speculation in hopes of restoring himself to goodgraces? If Bennett or Gurdjieff guessed his true intentions, it would explainthe cold shoulder.The Beast seemed to be waiting for a call, and at last it came, from Germany.Shortly before the end of the war, Theodor Reuss had abandoned his AnationalLodge. He was still a Propagandachef, however, and in July 1920 he attended a“World Federation of Universal Freemasonry” in Zurich.53 So did the ubiquitousJohn De Kay. By the early 1920s, Reuss’ failing health arguably led him to issuesome questionable degrees and charters. Crowley pounced on this as evidence ofReuss’ foundering judgment. Our man also slammed Reuss as the representative of“a beaten and disintegrating nation.”54 Their relationship grew more and morestrained until Reuss expelled Crowley from the OTO 1921.55 Not to be outdone,the Beast brazenly informed Reuss that he was assuming the mantle of FraterSuperior and “Outer Head” (OHO) of the Order. The dying Reuss’ failure torespond convinced Crowley that he was now the Order’s master, a position heclaimed until his death. Reuss’ passing in October 1923 seemed to seal the deal.However, according to Karl Germer (whom we will meet shortly), Reuss and theBeast patched up their differences before the former’s death and met for onelast time in Palermo, Sicily sometime in 1922.56 This must have occurred justprior to or soon after Crowley’s trip to England. Reuss recently had attendedanother Masonic congress in Switzerland where his plan to establish the GnosticMass as the ritual for a “unified world Masonic federation” received a ruderebuff. Where the Palermo meeting left the matter of leadership over the OTO isunclear.Other brethren, including the man Reuss had named OTO chief in Germany, HeinrichTraenker, challenged Crowley’s succession, and the Reich was still the maincenter of the Order. In early 1925, however, a fresh “revelation” convincedTraenker that the Secret Chiefs really did want Crowley at the helm. He invitedthe Beast to an upcoming gathering that would resolve the question once and forall.The Weida Conference, held around the summer solstice in the little Thuringiantown of Hohenleuben, ended up splintering the OTO. Crowley had the support ofOlsen, old devotees such as Norman Mudd, and a forgiving Leah Hirsig, along witha German faction led by the above Karl Johannes Germer and Martha Kuentzel.Traenker, after another change of heart, rejected Crowley’s authority and leftwith his own followers. In the middle was a third German group headed by EugenGrosche, a former socialist commissar. Grosche and his devotees, who eventuallydubbed themselves the Fraternitas Saturni (“Brotherhood of Saturn”),acknowledged the Beast’s spiritual guidance but elected to govern their ownaffairs.57The Weida gathering was Crowley’s first visit to Germany since before the war,and a long-sought opportunity to connect or reconnect with persons and currentsthere. Of course, occult assemblies provided excellent cover for a littlereconnaissance and recruitment. From that perspective, his most importantcontact was Karl Germer. In 1914 Germer had been the Berlin representative ofAlfred Herbert, Ltd., a British machine-tool firm based in Coventry with manyRoyal Navy contracts—a perfect job for a German spy. Germer’s sales territoryincluded European Russia, and he was there when war erupted, narrowly avoidinginternment. During the conflict, he spent much of his time on the Eastern Front,where he served in military intelligence. For his “special services,” Germerreceived the coveted Iron Cross First Class.58 He may have maintained aconnection to German intelligence after the war, or, as a distinguished veteran,he may have been on the lookout for a new employer. Be that as it may, in theyears to come, Germer would become one of Crowley’s most loyal followers and avital financial prop.About a year after meeting Crowley, in spring 1926, Germer and his wifejourneyed to New York. Mrs. Germer hoped that the change of scene would free herhusband’s mind from esoterica and the influence of the “international crook”Crowley.59 She was disappointed. Soon after their arrival, Germer took off forChicago to meet a mysterious “brother of the Order” on the Beast’s orders.60 Theunnamed brother may have been Crowley’s magical son, C.S. Jones, but Alvo vonAlvensleben was still living in the U.S. and doing business in the Windy City.Alvo was a fellow German, well connected in America and the Reich. Did the Beasthave some new or unfinished business with him? Germer disappeared for almost twoyears before finally reappearing in Boston. Meanwhile, his exasperated wife hadreturned to Germany and filed for divorce.On the surface, the situation in Germany was very different from what it hadbeen a few years before. The Weimar Republic seemed to have weathered its earlycrises and be on a path to peace and prosperity. Fall 1923 witnessed theCommunists’ last failed attempt at armed revolution and a smaller abortiveinsurrection in Munich by a band of Fascist imitators, the National Socialists.Their leader was a preternaturally charismatic ex-corporal and former army spy,Adolf Hitler.The occult certainly influenced Hitler and the Nazi movement, mainly through“Ariosophist” groups (a racialized mutation of Theosophy) such as the GermanenOrden and, most infamously, the Munich-based Thule Gesellschaft (Society). Theextent of such influence continues to be debated, especially where Hitlerhimself is concerned.61 As the following chapter will discuss, Crowley has beeninvoked as a guiding influence on the future Führer. That is doubtful, but hedefinitely took an interest in Hitler and tried to approach him with the aim ofpromoting Thelema. Those overtures may have had an ulterior motive.At or right after the Weida Conference, the Mage encountered one of Hitler’srecent co-conspirators in the Beer-hall Putsch, General Erich Ludendorff. Allbut dictator of Germany in the final years of the war, Ludendorff had driftedinto mystical right-wing extremism and saw Germany’s defeat as the work ofsinister “occult forces,” namely Jews, Jesuits, and Freemasons.62 The antidote,Ludendorff argued, was the revival of German paganism, which would replaceenfeebling “Jewish” Christianity. This view gave him some common ground withCrowley and also formed the basis of his loose alliance with the Nazis. Crowleyrecalled that he and Ludendorff discussed “Nordic Theology,” including theoccult symbology of the swastika. He later spun this into the claim that he,through Ludendorff, convinced Hitler to adopt the swastika as his Party’stalisman. The kernel of truth may be that the Beast was trying to use Ludendorffto contact, or simply collect inside information on, the rising Nazi leader.63More generally, Ludendorff was a valuable source of information about occultinfluences on the German Right. He was friendly with Dr. Karl Haushofer, aBavarian officer, scholar, and mystical adept who also was sympathetic withNazism, or at least with some Nazis. Haushofer claimed membership in theso-called Vril Society or Luminous Lodge, another body which sought contact withspiritually and technologically advanced beings (another twist on the Mahatmasor Secret Chiefs) dwelling somewhere in or under the vastness of Central Asia.64After the war, Haushofer held a professorship at the University of Munich, wherehe expounded his “geopolitics,” a key point of which was the need for moreLebensraum (living space) for the German Volk.65 He was surrounded by a coterieof admiring students, among them the eager young Rudolf Hess, Hitler’s bosomfriend and right-hand man.At the same time Crowley cultivated connections in the German Right, he alsotried to win friends among the Bolsheviks. Early in 1925, he drafted a manifestoand accompanying essay advocating a new religion for Soviet Russia, an“orgiastic” faith “based upon sound science,” which would provide a neededspiritual basis for the Revolution. He even proposed a non-Russian “Savior” asthe personal focus of this new faith. To no surprise, the religion was Thelema,and the savior, Aleister Crowley. “This new rite,” he argued, “will produce inEurope and America the utmost religious consternation, and the old faiths willcrumble into dust. . . .”66 Thelema would become the vehicle of WorldRevolution—or vice versa.The recipient of this modest proposal, written in English, was one of two oldfriends of Crowley then in Paris, both with high-level connections in RedRussia. One was dancer Isadora Duncan, just back from a not altogether happystint in Moscow. A much more likely intermediary was the mutual friend ofDuncan, Crowley, and Willie Seabrook, newspaperman Walter Duranty, then in Parisrecuperating from injuries received in a train wreck. As Moscow correspondentfor the New York Times, Duranty had become de facto dean of Western journalistsin the Red capital. He had privileged access to Soviet leaders, the ability tomove freely in and out of the Socialist Motherland, and even a reliable supplyof heroin for his junkie wife (and Crowley’s erstwhile lover), Jane Cheron. Theamoral Duranty earned these perks by acting as a tool and apologist for theSoviet regime and probably informer.67 He was the perfect person to carryCrowley’s manifesto back to Russia and put it before the right people.Occult influences flourished in the Soviet realm, albeit less obviously than inGermany. The Masonic and other secret societies that permeated pre-revolutionaryRussian society did not disappear after 1917, but adapted and spread theirinfluence into the Soviet government and secret services.68 A key figure in thiswas Dr. Aleksandr Vasil’evich Barchenko, longtime student of the esoteric andparanormal, and de facto “Bolshevik professor of the occult.”69 A MartinistFreemason, Barchenko was a one-time student of Gurdjieff’s teachings and seemsto have maintained some connection to that master at Fontainebleau. In thatregard, it is worth remembering the alleged Soviet connections of Gurdjieff’sman Bennett. Like the Theosophists, Haushofer, and many Nazis, Barchenko alsobelieved that dwelling in their sanctuary of Shambhallah (Shangri-La, orAgartha) somewhere in Central Asia were powerful adepts who held the knowledgeof a lost civilization. However, in the version promoted by Barchenko, insteadof being a survival of ancient Aryan Thule, these Ascended Masters were theoriginal Communists.During the 1920s, Barchenko touted his ideas to members of the Red hierarchy.The most receptive was Gleb Ivanovich Bokii, chief of the “Special Department”(Spetsotdel’) of the Soviet secret police (the dreaded Cheka, later OGPU, NKVD,and eventually KGB). This was an ultra-secret section that handled codes andciphers, and even the personal dossiers of the Soviet leaders. Bokii himself wasa Martinist, a Rosicrucian, and a reputed devotee of Tantric sex rituals.70Surely Crowley would have fascinated him. Bokii put Barchenko in charge of aspecial laboratory within the Moscow Institute of Experimental Medicine to studyhypnosis, telekinesis, remote viewing, ESP, etc., with the aim of harnessingthem for intelligence purposes.Bokii and Barchenko even formed an occult lodge, the innocuous-sounding UnitedLabor Brotherhood (Edinoe trudovoe bratstvo), with veteran occultists and secretpolice operatives among its members. The Brotherhood survived until Stalinliquidated the lot during the late 1930s. Interestingly, the main charge leveledagainst Bokii, Barchenko, and friends was that their occult activities were acover for treasonous contacts with British intelligence in the Far East.71Barchenko and Bokii were behind the OGPU’s effort to exploit the mystic, artist,and explorer Nikolai Roerich (or Rerikh). Roerich, too, was an ardent believerin mysterious and wonderful Shambhallah and a willing tool in Communistintrigues around the world. In 1925, he embarked on an expedition into theHimalayas with a retinue including OGPU agents disguised as religious pilgrims.Roerich’s stated aim was to contact Tibet’s Dalai Lama. More secretly andimportantly, Bokii’s men were seeking the Mahatmas of Shambhallah.Later, Roerich set up shop in India, where his presence caused concern amongofficials who suspected that he had been “‘illuminated’ under duress as to theexcellence of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.”72 In July 1928 a flapoccurred in London when the Explorer’s son, Sviatoslav Roerich, applied for aBritish visa to visit his father. The India Office’s query to the Foreign Officefor more information fell to a former Army and RAF officer turned diplomat andSIS agent, Arthur Vivian Burbury. Burbury recently had returned to London from athree-year posting as third secretary with the British Legation in Moscow. Therehis secret intelligence duties focused on Soviet intrigues in Asia.73 In replyto the IO request, he noted:> As to possible sources of information about Roerich—his connection with> Russia, Thibet . . . Theosophists . . . and various ‘secret’ organizations . .> . leads me to think that information as to him might be obtained from an> (undesirable) Englishman who has had curiously intimate knowledge of all these> things. His real name is Aleister Crowley. . . . I could endeavor privately to> have him sounded [out] if it were thought desirable. He is a rascal and dare> not show his face in England; but his knowledge of oriental evil is very> deep.74Mr. H.L. Baggallay of the FO warned in response that it would be “deplorable ifit became known that the FO had any communication, however remote, with AleisterCrowley . . . who would at once go to prison if he set foot in this country.”Baggallay’s colleague C.M. Palairet cautioned more strongly, “Whatever happens,do not let us approach, however remotely, Crowley.”75Burbury supposedly received his introduction to Crowley from Lance Sieveking, aBBC journalist based in Paris, but a connection seems to have predated this.How, for instance, did intelligence officer Burbury learn about the Beast’sexpertise on “oriental evil?” Cleary, Burbury knew how to contact him. Our mantherefore was not entirely cast adrift, though evidently viewed in a highlynegative light. Burbury’s recent service in Russia and his special interest inAsiatic intrigues logically included Barchenko’s and Bokii’s schemes, andpossibly the doings of Bennett, De Kay, and Gurdjieff as well.The theme of Asian intrigue also crops up in Rene Guenon’s discussion ofCrowley’s dealings with another British officer in the 1920s, “ColonelEttington.”76 Guenon was rightly convinced that the Beast was an asset of the“British secret service.”77 The man in question actually was Percy ThomasEtherton, an Indian Army man who had spent much of WWI in Egypt and other partsof the Middle East where he met Feilding. During 1918-1924 Etherton was HisMajesty’s “political resident” in Kashgar, a remote caravan town in westernmostChinese Turkestan, conveniently and perilously close to the Soviet frontier.78From Kashgar, Etherton gathered intelligence on the Reds and ran agents such asthe swashbuckling Frederick Bailey and L.V.S. Blacker. He continued to dabble inintelligence matters after his return to Delhi and London, and took at least acasual interest in Theosophy. Etherton would have been keen to learn all hecould about the Soviets’ plans to reach Tibet and Shambhallah.In spring 1929 Crowley’s life seemed to be going smoothly. He had a comfortableflat on the Avenue Suffren and had resumed writing, preparing Magick in Theoryand Practice and the long-delayed Moonchild for publication. He had alsoacquired a devoted secretary in a young Jewish-American, Francis Israel Regardie(1907- 1985), and a fresh Scarlet Woman (and soon-to-be wife), Maria TheresaFerrari de Miramar, a thirty-something Nicaraguan voodoo priestess.Then his spying past came back to haunt him. Crowley had lived in Paris fornearly six years without the least molestation from French authorities despitehis flagrant drug use, sexual deviations, and well-known association with BlackMagic. So it was a surprise when on 9 March the French suddenly suspended hisresidency permit and demanded that he leave the country. He had to clear out by17 April, and take Regardie and Miramar with him.Crowley wrote to the Embassy demanding (and fully expecting) intercession on hisbehalf by His Majesty’s Government. The original correspondence in the case was,typically, “not kept,” but the registry index of the Foreign and CommonwealthOffice preserves a brief summary. It reads: “[T]he Embassy are unable tointervene with the French authorities on his behalf. Has ascertained that Mr.Crowley has been asked to leave French territory exclusively on moral grounds.Proposes therefore to take no action on his behalf.”79 As Crowley later put it,“the British Embassy has left my case severely [alone] and has absolutelyrefused to help me.”80What “moral grounds” justified the expulsion? The Mage mentions that the Frenchofficials who came to see him were very curious about drugs, even wondering ifhis coffee mill might be a “machine for cocaine,” and a press report mentionspolice suspecting him in an “affaire de cocaine.”81 These suspicions could havearisen from Crowley’s recent involvement with a dubious Spanish nobleman. DonLouis Ferdinand de Bourbon-Orleans, a member of both the Spanish and Frenchroyal houses and cousin to King Alfonso XIII, had been frequently accused of“questionable conduct” in France and elsewhere. Don Louis’s first run-in withthe law came in 1924 and led to his expulsion from France on criminal chargesprobably involving narcotics. He moved to Portugal, but in 1926 customs officerson the Portuguese-Spanish border arrested him for drug smuggling. A year later,the French again kicked him out, permanently this time, for assorted criminalinfractions and all-around bad manners.82Don Louis may have been one of Crowley’s heroin connections. In any case, it isnot hard to see why French authorities would have found their relationshipquestionable. The Beast insisted that he had “never met or corresponded with[the Spaniard] in any way,” but that does not rule out entanglement in DonLouis’ affairs. Those notably included the Don’s proposed marriage to a richAmerican widow living near Paris, Mabelle Corey. Since Louis could not enterFrance, these negotiations had to be conducted by proxy. The Don’srepresentative was Carl de Vidal Hundt, a German-American actor andoccult-dabbler who had been in Hollywood when Crowley passed through in 1915.Hundt was in and out of Europe after the war where he pursued his acting careerwith little success. By the late 1920s, he was earning his crust as a publicistand press agent. Crowley himself engaged Hundt to promote his books and polishhis image. Mabelle Corey’s reputed fascination with the occult probablymotivated Hundt to enlist the Beast’s help in the Don Louis scheme. Then again,Crowley may have volunteered his services, hoping for a share of the payoff.Whatever the case, the Don Louis flap sounds more likely a handy pretext than apressing reason to expel the English Magician. Suspicion of espionage almostcertainly was the real reason. French authorities never accused him publicly,but the press was more outspoken. One example was the conservative Catholic,conspiracy-mongering Revue Internationale des Societes Secretes, which had longpainted Crowley as a knave and pernicious influence.83 Curiously, the Sovietsalso later concluded that he had been kicked out “for espionage and the good ofFrance,” though just what they based this conclusion on is uncertain.84If Crowley was engaged in espionage, who was he working for? And what or whomwas he spying on?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 Renegade.2 Mariel, 56.3 Robert Richardson, “The Priory of Sion and the Da Vinci Code,”www.alpheus.orr/html/articles/esoteric_history/richardson4.htm[http://www.alpheus.orr/html/articles/esoteric_history/richardson4.htm], andSociete Perillos, “The Priory of Sion.com/pos1-2.html[http://Sion.com/pos1-2.html].

"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWELVE [../Text/contents.html] 045 [../Images/00002.jpg] INTO THE REICH046 [../Images/00002.jpg] ONE OF THE PRESS EXTRACTS PRESERVED in Crowley’s Deuxième Bureau filecryptically attributes to the English Magician “certain suspect relations withthe intelligence services of foreign countries.”1 Pierre Mariel also notes apiece in the 14 April 1929 edition of Paris-Midi that specifically charged thatthe Beast “had been proven to be a secret agent in the service of Germany.”2French press coverage of l’Affaire Crowley almost never failed to mention hiswork for Berlin in wartime America. Of course, the same articles colorfullylabeled and mislabeled him a Mage Noire, the Raspoutine anglais, and “SirCrowley.”3 Similar allegations appeared in the New York Times and even in papersas far away as New Zealand. Interestingly the British press largely ignored theaffair, although one minor paper repeated the accusation that the infamous Mr.Crowley had been booted from France because he “has been acting as a secretagent for Germany.”4The Mage fought back as best he could, pointing out that his wartime service tothe Germans had been under the supervision of the “Naval Intelligence Service,”or simply “l’Intelligence Service anglais.”5 He bragged about inciting theGermans to provoke the Americans, and singled out Admiral “Gount” as a man whocould vouch for his loyalty to England.6 Crowley actually cabled Gaunt torequest a letter attesting to his true colors, but the Admiral, like the rest ofHis Majesty’s officials, discreetly ignored the embattled Beast. The invocationof Gaunt and British intelligence was a desperate attempt to leverage help fromLondon, but there was only so far he dared go. Saying too much could result infar worse repercussions than deportation from France.A connection between Crowley and German intelligence may not have been a fantasyspun by the Gallic press. We have already noted that his key devotee in Germany,Karl Germer, had at least a past association with Berlin’s secret services.Despite the official détente created by the Locarno Treaty (1925) and likediplomatic niceties, France remained Germany’s mortal enemy. French troopsstayed in the Rhineland long after the Americans and British had pulled out, andParis was loath to abandon its huge reparations claims. Moreover, Berlin had akeen interest in French aeronautical developments. So did London.But would the Germans have been desperate or foolish enough to trust a man whoopenly admitted gulling and betraying them during the Great War? That was then,this was now. If Crowley had deceived them, it proved his qualification for thejob of deceiving others. After all, Kurt Jahnke, the éminence grise of Germanintelligence in the 1920s, insisted that “the full value of a Secret Servicealways depended on the number and standard of Double Agents.”7 For the Germans,as for the British, the crucial question about Crowley was not whether he couldbe trusted, but whether he could be useful.Weimar intelligence and security agencies were a more tangled mix than most. Atthe top was the Military Intelligence Service (Deutscher MilitärischerNachrichtendienst—DMN), the remnant of the wartime Abteiling IIIb. Under theVersailles Treaty, the Allies allowed the Germans only defensive intelligencecapability, so in 1921 the DMN became a much scaled-down Abwehrgruppe, laterplain Abwehr. It remained a shoestring operation until 1923, when the Frenchinvasion of the Ruhr triggered its expansion. Many old agents, including Jahnke,and maybe Germer, returned to the fold. Versailles Treaty or no, the Germansresumed aggressive intelligence abroad, mostly against France and Poland.The Weimar Republic also had its equivalent of MI5 or Special Branch. Up until1928, when leftist pressure forced its dissolution, this was theReichskommissariat für die Überwachung der öffentlichen Ordnung (Commissariatfor the Protection of Public Order). A secretive inner core stayed busy evenafter the official dismantling. RÜöO comprised two agencies, Abteilung 1A, whichoperated in the Berlin Police Presidium, and the ultra-secret CentralsStaatspolizei (Central State Police). The embryo of the future Gestapo, theStaatspolizei oversaw the security of Germany’s secret re-armament programs andthe attendant collaboration with the Soviets.The German military initiated collaboration with the Red Army in 1921, and itsoon grew to include Russian-based plants producing planes, tanks, and poisongas.8 This collusion was of great interest to British intelligence, and anythingCrowley could find out about it would have been welcome, even if thatnecessitated his doing a little dirty work for the Germans against the French.Nations, it is said, do not have friends, only interests.Government agencies were only a part of the picture. Even before they came topower, the Nazis had their own intelligence-counterintelligence bodies. In 1932,“Blond Beast” and future Holocaust mastermind Reinhard Heydrich created theSicherheitsdienst (SD, Security Service) inside the SS (Schutzstaffel), HeinrichHimmler’s black-uniformed corps. The SD was to ferret out and destroy Hitler’s(and Himmler’s) enemies, including those within the Party itself. Not to beoutdone, the intra-Party rivals of the SS, the brown-shirted SA(Sturmabteilung), maintained an “information service” run by a half-Scottishpolitical adventurer, Georg Bell.9 Bell also served as a confidential agent forAnglo-Dutch oil tycoon Sir Henri Deterding, which raised suspicions that he alsohad links to British intelligence.10Then there was our friend Kurt Jahnke. Around 1924, Jahnke set up an ostensiblyprivate agency, the “Jahnkebüro,” which operated from the seclusion of hisPomeranian estate.11 Jahnke was with a close friend of Franz Pfeffer vonSalomon, chief of the SA from 1926 to 1930, and he knew Georg Bell. Mostimportantly, Jahnke’s organization worked hand-in-glove with the Abwehr and theSoviets.12 In the early 1920s, Jahnke had continued to act as double agent forthe Americans by supplying information to the U.S. Army’s military observer inBerlin, and he probably did likewise for the British. For Jahnke, Crowley wouldhave been a handy, discreet, and familiar contact. The connection might havebeen made stronger by a common interest in the occult. Jahnke was an intenselyprivate man, and the doings at his estate were the source of dark rumors.Weimar Germany still roiled with Communist intrigues. Besides the local Reds—theKPD—and their Geheimapparat (Secret Apparatus), Moscow’s OGPU, militaryintelligence, and the Comintern (Communist International) all maintained a majorpresence that linked up with Communist and Red-inspired activities in othercountries.13 As it happened, the French broke up a big Soviet spy ring shortlybefore the Beast’s expulsion. Moreover, during 1928-1929 Crowley had cultivatedthe acquaintance of a colorful Hungarian in Paris, Louis Gibarti (real nameLaszlo Dobos), a veteran Comintern and OGPU agent, about whom more in the nextchapter. For now, suffice it that Gibarti was the right-hand man of theComintern’s chief agent in Western Europe, the German Willi Münzenberg.14 Frenchauthorities kept a watchful eye on Gibarti and would not have have overlookedhis association with the curious Englishman. That can only have added to theirdiscomfort about Crowley’s residence.Crowley’s contact with Gibarti, like his dealings with the German services, tookplace with the tolerance and probable encouragement of persons in London. To theextent the Beast was spying in France, he ultimately was doing so for dear oldEngland. London, as noted, had ample reason to mistrust and snoop on its dubiousally. During the 1920s, British intelligence developed a pro-German stance, atleast where France was concerned, and France was on the lookout for Anglo-Germancollusion. They found plenty of it. The late 1920s saw two sensational spy casesinvolving British subjects. At the end of 1925, the Sûreté arrested threeBritons and two French accomplices for espionage. A French court convicted thelot of spying on air fields and naval facilities.15 At the head of the ring wasCaptain John Henry Leather, an officer attached to British military intelligenceand probably affiliated with SIS.16 In addition to serving Britain, Leather andhis crew passed much the same information to Germany.In late 1926, French authorities arrested another former British officer, VivianStranders, for supplying secrets to Berlin. The French were convinced thatStranders also was spying for his native country. In order to dispel thisnotion, MI5 was planning to seize him on its own charges.17 After two years in aFrench prison, Stranders bolted to Germany just before Crowley’s expulsion.Crowley’s PR man, Carl de Vidal Hundt, also took an odd interest in Stranders’case, which doubtless raised Gallic suspicions. In the Reich, Stranders became aGerman citizen and later a fervent Nazi. He also may have had contact withSoviet agents. London wanted him watched.One person who may have had a bearing on Crowley’s relationship with Britishintelligence in early 1929 was a mysterious Mr. Stratford. According to FrancisDickie, a Canadian journalist in Paris, Stratford suddenly popped up at theBeast’s side that spring as part of a bizarre plot to fake Crowley’s death. Theytried to enlist Dickie in the scheme (about which more later). Stratford, herecalled, was “a dubious character, everyone in the little café-world aroundMontparnasse knew, and wondered how he made a living.”18 Stratford claimed to bean old Cambridge classmate of the Mage, but no one believed that, either. Othersthought he must be a spy. Crowley himself apparently never mentioned him. Wereit not for Stratford’s implied age (any Cambridge classmate of the Beast wouldhave had to be in his fifties), he might have been one of two other men inCrowley’s life around this time.One of these we have met before: George Langelaan, who recounted Crowley’sconfessions about his WWI undercover work and the Lusitania. Langelaan placedhis first meeting with Crowley “about 1930,” but it must have been in early1929, shortly before the Beast’s ouster.19 Although born to British parents,Langelaan had lived most of his life in France, which helped to equip him forintelligence work. It is unknown whether Langelaan, later a WWII SpecialOperations Executive (SOE) officer, had links to London’s secret services whenhe met the Beast. In any case, young Langelaan found his way into Crowley’sconfidence. He recalls watching the Mage take on chess master SaviellyTartakower at the Paris British Chess Club, convinced by what he saw thatCrowley used hypnotism as part of his strategy.20 There is no entry of any suchencounter in Tartokower’s official game record, but he was in Paris at the time.Langelaan also had sporadic encounters with Crowley during 1930-1932. Thatcoincides with Crowley’s stay in Germany, but whether the meetings took placethere or elsewhere is uncertain.The second man was Gerald Joseph Yorke, a.k.a. “Frater Volo Intelligere.” He metCrowley in 1927, having flown to Paris in a flush of enthusiasm for the Beast’swritings and wisdom. At least, that was how he later explained it. Gerald Yorkecame from a wealthy Midlands family not at all pleased by his hobnobbing withthe infamous Wickedest Man in the World.21 A Cambridge graduate and a lieutenantin the Territorial Reserves (2nd Royal Gloucester Hussars), Yorke was personablebut secretive, perhaps to conceal his alleged homosexuality, his interest in theoccult, his intelligence work, or all three. He confessed to being a member ofCrowley’s A∴A∴, but denied having anything to do with the OTO or being theBeast’s “follower” per se. Nevertheless, he readily assumed the role ofCrowley’s “financial organizer and ombudsman.”22 Yorke respected Crowley themagick adept, but not especially Crowley the man, being appalled by the Beast’scavalier treatment of women and recklessness with money.The real key to their relationship may be that Yorke was the Mega Therion’sassigned case officer. If so, which branch of spookdom did he serve? Hisprofession or cover was that of a freelance journalist and correspondent forReuters. That and his later work in China all point to SIS, but the linesseparating the various aspects of British intelligence were especially vague inthis period.Another hint of an SIS connection is Yorke’s intercession in late 1928 with anintelligence worker mentioned in the last chapter, Arthur Burbury. The latter,recall, had touted the Beast as an expert on “oriental evil” and Sovietintrigues in Asia. Yorke was the probable intermediary. The new matter at handwas Crowley’s effort to get his book Magick in Theory and Practice published inBritain. Standing in the way was the blue-nosed Home Secretary WilliamJoynson-Hicks. Joynson-Hicks, or “Jix,” was a bosom friend of James Douglas ofthe Sunday Express, a paper that had done more than its share to blackenCrowley’s name. In hope of getting around the “Jix” obstacle, Crowley sent Yorkeand another young former officer, Lance Sieveking, to see Burbury at the ForeignOffice. Crowley’s secretary Israel Regardie believed that this really hadsomething to do with Burbury’s connections to the “secret service.”23 It wouldnot have been the first time the Beast had used his intelligence contacts tocircumvent or neutralize opposition from another branch of British officialdom.The effort succeeded; Magick in Theory and Practice appeared in print the nextyear.Yorke also connected Crowley to a cabal of occultist-literary types centered onthe Mandrake Press, a small publishing house that would bring out some ofCrowley’s works, including Confessions and Moonchild. Besides Yorke, theoutfit’s directors included a pro-fascist Australian, P.R. “Inky” Stephenson.During 1930, Stephenson, with help from Regardie, published The Legend ofAleister Crowley, part of Crowley’s new offensive to redeem his public image.Other directors were a mysterious Major J.C.S. MacAllen and an ex-RAF officer,Robin Thynne, who, as we will see, had shadowy ties to the intelligence realm.Another of Mandrake’s authors was a Crowley acquaintance, the composer PeterWarlock (Philip Heseltine), whose lover was another composer, Elizabeth Poston.Warlock died in 1930, but in the coming war Poston ended up working for Britishintelligence.24 Thus, in his dealings with Mandrake Press, the Mage foundhimself in the familiar situation of being surrounded by past, present, andfuture spies. Mandrake, however, proved a financial bust and collapsed amidaccusations of malfeasance and incompetence.After he quit Paris, the Beast holed up in the Hotel Metropole in Brussels.Regardie and Crowley’s fiancée, the exotic Miss de Miramar, had tried to enterEngland but were turned back by His Majesty’s officials. Technically, this wasdue to their lack of visas and other documents. Crowley seems to have beensurprised by the rebuff, and worried that it meant an equally hostile receptionof him. Had he revealed too much to the French press? Belgian authorities madeclear that they did not welcome his presence. Crowley once again turned to hisfriend and “employee of the Intelligence Service,” Gerald Yorke.25Shortly after Crowley’s exit from France, Yorke received a call from ScotlandYard’s Col. J.F.C. Carter, mentioned in the previous chapter, the boss ofSpecial Branch and an avid Red-hunter. A few years later, Crowley would writehalf-jokingly, “legend says that my dossier at Scotland Yard fills a wholeroom.”26 Roomful or not, Carter had ample sources at his disposal about theBeast’s history; his long association with George Makgill and Nesta Websterdoubtless versed him well in the sins of Aleister Crowley, real and imaginary.However, as a former Indian police official and a wartime member of MI5’ssection G, Carter had also known Robert Nathan (d. 1921), who could have offereda very different view of Mr. Crowley. The same may have been true for Burbury.Burbury, Carter, and Yorke all shared a Masonic allegiance, which might haveincluded more occult ones. According to Yorke, Carter wanted to know “whatmagical potions Brother V.I. [Yorke] had been brewing recently with Britain’sWorst Man,” which shows that Carter knew about their connection.27 Carter mayhave smelled a link between such activity and Crowley’s trouble in France. Yorkesimply offered that “the Beast was not as beastly as he was made out to be,”whereupon Carter asked to meet him.In late May, Carter handed Yorke enough money to arrange the Mage’s travel toLondon.28 On 11 June, Crowley recorded in his diary that he had dined withCarter and that the upshot of their meeting was “All clear.”29 Years later,Yorke assured a curious American that Crowley “was never in any difficulties ortrouble with the Home Office”—at least, not with Col. Carter.30Carter’s support was vital to getting Crowley back into the country withouthassles or invasive scrutiny, and he did not proffer this help out of kindness.If the Colonel went out of his way for Crowley, he expected something in return.He may have received quiet encouragement from another interested quarter. TheYard and its Special Branch were supposed to be concerned with internalsecurity, not foreign espionage. In reality, it had run agents abroad sinceMelville’s time. Likewise SIS, despite its foreign intelligence mandate, ran itsown domestic anti-Communist section. That did not sit well with Kell’s MI5, theagency formally charged with internal security.What all these entities shared in the late 1920s was an overriding concern withCommunist subversion. Special Branch’s main Red-hunter then was Guy MaynardLiddell, so any reports Crowley filed with the Branch would have ended up in hishands. As head of Special Branch, Carter also oversaw two sections, SS1, theliaison with SIS, and SS2, which handled coordination with MI5. As noted,everything about Yorke smacks of SIS, making him a likely liaison to Carter fromthat agency. This suggests that the Beast became a shared asset, with Col.Carter acting as a cut-out to mask SIS’ involvement. Curiously, SIS’ list ofCrowley “Press References” stops dead in 1929 with a single article on theFrench expulsion, resuming only in 1947 with a brief announcement of his death.During 1929, Communist activity seemed especially dangerous in Germany. Whilethe Great Depression was still around the corner, the Reich was already astirwith economic unrest, which helped to inflame the Communist and Nazi movements.Hitler’s Party and the Reds were bitter rivals, but they shared a commondetermination to topple the Weimar Republic. Crowley’s array of connections gavehim access to elements in both camps, and soon, on Carter’s orders, he would beoff to Germany again.First, however, Carter may have looked to Crowley for help with another matter.In the summer of 1929, expatriate Italian anarchists were plotting anotherattempt to kill Mussolini.31 The center of the conspiracy was Brussels, whereCrowley had just been cooling his heels. Given his reputation as a victim of IlDuce’s persecution and his rumored connection to the 1926 plot, Crowley wasideally suited to gain the confidence of the anarchists and ferret out details.It recalled his days in New York. Whether or not Crowley lent a hand, Carterpenetrated the plot and passed the necessary information to Mussolini’s secretpolice.On 2 July, the tabloid Daily Sketch noted Crowley’s presence in London “after along absence.”The brief article slants noticeably in favor of the prodigal son.Calling him “one of the most interesting and talked of men in Europe,” itpooh-poohs “exaggerated and ridiculous” stories circulated about him. “Actually,he is a very brilliant and interesting man,” it continued, “who has traveled allover the world observing religious practices and philosophy.” It even pluggedhis forthcoming Mandrake titles. This puffery’s timing with the Beast’s meetingwith Carter is telling. The Daily Sketch was run by Lord Rothermere (HaroldHarmsworth), a close friend of Carter who had done his bit for the Ministry ofInformation during the World War. Newspapers he controlled would remainnoticeably friendly toward Crowley over the next few years.Of course, not everyone was happy to see Crowley back in England. The Patriot,the organ of the arch-conservative Lord Northumberland (another crony ofMakgill, Webster, and the British Fascisti), soon weighed in to defend decency.On 2 May Northumberland’s paper had run a piece that raked over Crowley’sdisreputable past, including his intrigues with the Golden Dawn. Now, counteringthe Sketch’s spin, another Patriot article accused the Sketch of “doping” theBritish public by misguided praise of such “subversive persons and doctrines.”32Crowley still had plenty of enemies in his homeland.But he also had friends besides Carter and Yorke. The Chelsea hostess Gwen Otterwas an old acquaintance of Crowley’s and a friend to artists and bohemians ofall stripes. Crowley popped up at her gatherings during early summer 1929. Eventhere British intelligence had eyes and ears. Among his fellow guests at Otter’swas Francis Toye, music editor for the London Morning Post. Toye was cousin tothe Beast’s ex-brother-in-law, Gerald Kelly, and another veteran of Hall’s NavalIntelligence during the war. Toye retained spookish connections, and while hepassed off his encounter with Crowley as purely casual, there could have beenmore to it.33On 16 August, Crowley surfaced in Leipzig where he finally exchanged vows withMaria de Miramar, beginning a turbulent and short-lived marriage. The nuptialswere necessary for Miramar’s British visa. Belgium’s laws made it hard forforeigners to contract marriage there, so Germany was a logical choice. Even so,there were German towns much closer than Leipzig. Crowley chose the hometown ofhis loyal acolyte and likely intelligence contact Karl Germer, who attended thewedding.Another German attendee, Martha Kuentzel, had become a fanatical admirer ofHitler, in whom she saw a “magickal child” and the embodiment of the New Aeon.In 1925 Crowley had assured her that “the nation which first accepted the Bookof the Law, officially, would thereby become the leading nation in the world.”34Apparently on her own initiative, Kuentzel translated the Book and sent it tothe future Führer. It probably never reached his desk. In fall 1930, however,Crowley tried to contact the Nazi chief through his old friend Col. “Bony”Fuller, now another British admirer of Fascism and later of the Third Reich.35There is no sign that the overture elicited a response.This did not stop Réné Guénon from later asserting that Crowley went to Berlinin the early 1930s specifically to contact Hitler and succeeded in becoming a“secret counselor” of the Nazi leader.36 A wilder version holds that the Beastactually became Adolf’s Svengali or alter ego.37 Walter Johannes Stein andTrevor Ravenscroft, both followers of Anthroposophist Rudolf Steiner, allegedthat Hitler was the initiate of an occult doctrine “similar to, and in partderived from, the horrible sex magic of Aleister Crowley.”38 There is nocredible evidence for any of this. However, the claims of Stein and Ravenscroftmay somehow relate to Crowley’s peculiar relationship with some of Steiner’sfaithful in the years ahead.Crowley certainly found Hitler fascinating, but so did many people. Upon readingHerrmann Rauschning’s Hitler Speaks, the Beast is said to have proclaimed thathis and the Führer’s intimate thoughts ran on the same rails, but Crowley’sfixation on Adolf seems more clinical than personal.39 In the same vein, theBeast’s declaration in a 1933 article for the Sunday Dispatch that “beforeHitler was, I am,” is sometimes cited as proof of an occult bond between thetwo.40 Taken in context, however, it is much less provocative, being merelyCrowley’s claim to a prior, special relationship with the swastika—that he hadbeen born with “four hairs curling from left to right” over his heart. Like somany other things, Crowley’s Naziphilia was a pose aimed at gaining attentionand influence. It does not seem to have worked on Hitler, but others may havebeen taken in.Around the same time Crowley was reaching out to Hitler, he also was courtingJoseph Stalin. In January 1930, he made an overture to the Soviet strongmanthrough Walter Duranty, and he would try again a few years later. Much asbefore, Crowley offered Stalin “a substitute for the God [the Soviets] hadspurned,” Thelema, and, of course, himself.41 The Beast’s efforts to curry favorin Moscow meshed with Carter’s and friends’ concerns about the Red Menace.On 25 August 1929, Crowley’s diary records a very interesting rendezvous,presumably on his way back from Germany, with Col. R.J.R. Brown.42The notationindicates that this was at least their second meeting. Most interesting of all,however, is the Colonel’s address or site of the get-together: 12 bis duMarechal Joffre, near Versailles, just outside Paris. So, the Beast did returnto France after all, despite his later claim that he never set foot there again.Given the circumstances, we must assume that he traveled incognito. The bigquestion, of course, is what was so important that he had to meet with Brownunder such circumstances? What relation did Col. Brown have to Carter andBritish intelligence? The same diary notes a dinner with Carter on 6 September,right after Crowley’s return to London. The meeting included a “long talk tillmidnight at [Carter’s] flat.”43 This was undoubtedly a debriefing.In late October, perhaps after a similar sojourn, the Mage met with both Carterand Yorke.44 His reports must have confirmed that things in Germany were fastgoing to Hell. The economic crash that October had sent unemployment soaring.The power of the Nazis and Communists grew with every downward tick in theeconomy, and the fragile coalition of moderates running the Republic wasdisintegrating.Crowley hung around London during winter 1929-1930, unsuccessfully trying tokeep Mandrake Press afloat while dealing with his frequently hysterical andinebriated wife. He had not lost his special knack for driving women over theedge. In February, public outcry scuttled his attempt to deliver a lecture onfifteenth-century mass murderer Gilles de Rais to the Oxford University PoetrySociety, proof that he had not lost his ugly reputation either.On 13 April 1930, Crowley headed back to the Reich. The day prior, his diarynoted receipt of money, “for Germany”, from the aforementioned Robin Thynne.45Was this for business purposes, or something else? Thynne’s name shows up againin a diary entry for 30 April after the Mage had reached Berlin.46 In thisCrowley suggests that Thynne or MacAllen see a certain “Pax” in Paris who owneda couple of Spanish-language newspapers. Said papers had “copied Paris lies.”The main part of the entry, however, concerns a lunch with Arnoldo Krumm-Heller,the German-Mexican occultist and secret agent we last saw headed back to Mexicofrom the Orkneys. Also referenced is a certain Steiner, though certainly notRudolf who had been dead since 1925.The Berliner Tageblatt of 3 May ran a short article acknowledging the “gentlemanbohemian’s” recent arrival and emphasized his past exploits as a mountainclimber.47 The Tageblatt piece did not seem to know quite what to make of this“peculiar personality.” Was Herr Crowley a “revolutionary philosopher,” or justa “foolish artist”? No thought seems to have been given to the possibility thathe was a spy. The article made special note of the fact that the Englishman hadoffered his advice to the German Himalayan expedition then preparing an assaulton Crowley’s old enemy, Kangchenjunga. The leader of the expedition was PaulBauer, a veteran alpinist and friend of Crowley’s former climbing partner,Eckenstein. A few years later, Bauer would become chief of the Nazi-sponsoredGerman Alpine Federation and a special adviser to the SS expedition HeinrichHimmler dispatched to Tibet.Bauer’s expedition piqued the interest and suspicions of officials in London andDelhi. The biggest expedition ever sent into the Himalayas, it was rumored to beequipped with all manner of technical innovations. Anything Crowley could havegleaned about those would have been worth his pay. The German attempt failed,but fresh on its heels the British began planning their own expedition, anaerial one, to photograph and map nearby Mt. Everest. One of the planners of theEverest flight was Crowley’s supposed contact Col. Percy Etherton.48Réné Guénon invokes Etherton’s name in a different context. Around this sametime, writes Guénon, Crowley founded a “Saturn-Lodge” in Berlin, and Col.Etherton was involved with it.49 Guénon may have been on to something, but heseems to be talking about the Fraternitas Saturni, the Thelemic offshoot formedin Germany in 1928 by Eugen Grosche (who dubbed himself Frater GregorGregorius), not Crowley. According to Germer, Crowley had nothing to do withGrosche or his group. Then again, Germer detested Grosche as a “sex-maniac” and“one of the lowest types of occultists.”50 Still, the Nazis later arrestedGrosche, and the Gestapo’s suspicion focused in part on his alleged connectionto the English Magician Crowley.51 The Mage and Etherton would have been morethan willing to exploit Grosche and his organization for whatever informationthey could provide. On the other hand, Germer’s own mystical name (one of them)was “Frater Saturnus,” so the mysterious lodge may have been just a branch ofthe OTO.Crowley’s latest foray into Germany occurred during a full-blown politicalcrisis. The teetering governing coalition collapsed at the end of March 1930 asthe nation sank into a seemingly bottomless depression. The leaders of thefoundering Weimar Republic, their grasp weakening, resorted to emergency powers.The secret battle had begun for the soul of the nation.In Berlin, in summer 1930, Crowley encountered the Viennese psychoanalyst AlfredAdler, mentioned earlier in connection with the Tavistock Institute. It may nothave been their first meeting. Adler’s name will crop up in a strangerassociation with Crowley’s a few years hence. Their link at present was KarlGermer, who was one of Adler’s patients. The Beast later claimed to “know[Adler] personally” and, implausibly, to have “handled” some of the Doctor’sBerlin patients and to have “put a lot of my own theory and practice into it.”52Perhaps Crowley merely referred to Germer, but a larger and more intimateconnection between Mage and Psychiatrist cannot be ruled out.Crowley wasted no time in finding a female diversion, this time anineteen-year-old German model and aspiring artist, Hanni Larissa Jaeger. Hedubbed her “the Monster,” which captures the mood of the relationship. Sexualimperative aside, a female traveling companion always made good cover. Thatsummer he and Hanni briefly returned to England, but on 29 August they departedSouthampton on a boat for Lisbon, where one of the strangest episodes inCrowley’s strange career would occur.The poet Fernando Pessoa met the couple in Lisbon, and he became the Beast’saccomplice in the stunt to come. Pessoa, a friend of Frank Harris, wasfascinated by the occult, and an esoteric Freemason and Rosicrucian.53 Crowley’sgrand scheme, planned for at least a year, was to fake his own death. As FrancisDickie had understood it in 1929, the basic idea was to get creditors off hisback and boost the value of his books, including those recently published byMandrake Press. He would eventually resurface, reap the rewards, and pay off hisand Mandrake’s debts. It was a plan hatched in desperation and a telling exampleof Crowley’s capacity for calculated deception.The Beast later tried to explain the plot as a misguided joke on Frau Jaeger. On18 September, Hanni, who may or may not have understood her part in the game,stormed off after a noisy brawl and caught a steamer back to Germany. A few dayslater, a broken-hearted Crowley left a suicide note near the Boca do Inferno, aswirling ocean inlet surrounded by jagged cliffs, and disappeared—sort of. Thesame day he supposedly took his fatal leap, Crowley, or someone using hispassport, crossed the Spanish frontier. Pessoa later admitted that he had seenthe Magician alive in Lisbon on 24 September.54 Over the next few weeks, otherreports put Crowley in Portugal, but his existence on Earth remained in doubt.In mid-October, a group of English devotees held a séance in hopes of contactinghim on the other side.55 Stories appeared in the French press claiming thatScotland Yard had sent detectives to investigate the Mage’s mysteriousdisappearance.56As a money-making scheme, the ploy was a bust. There is not even any evidencethat it much bothered Hanni Jaeger, although she and the Mage did reunitebriefly. Besides money and Hanni, however, there may have been another purposeto the undertaking. Crowley’s disappearance created an opportunity to go placesand do things in relative obscurity. The Portuguese town where Crowley spentmost of his stay, Cascais, was a posh, cosmopolitan resort full of millionairesand exiled royalty, among them the Spanish Bourbons and a whole colony ofGermans. In the months following, the Beast maintained a curiously low profile.Stories making the rounds in Paris placed him on a Hollywood movie set,lecturing at Cornell University, or even toasting the Revolution in Moscow.57Crowley did not disappear completely. Two people knew where he was, or at leasthow to reach him: Yorke and Carter. In October 1930, Carter sent the Beast aletter sternly advising him to stop “knocking around the Continent” and comeback to England to take care of his wife. Otherwise, warned the Colonel, Crowleycould find himself in “serious trouble.”58 Carter’s intervention was notmotivated by any sympathy for the former Madame de Miramar. He was concernedthat the abandoned, unstable woman’s mounting debts would end up landing Crowleyin hot water and generate more bad publicity, impairing his usefulness as anagent. Worse still, Scotland Yard might find itself stuck with the bills.By mid-1931, Crowley was back in Berlin, where political pressure continued tomount. Elections the previous fall saw Nazi seats in the Reichstag jump from 12to 107, while the Reds’ share grew from 54 to 77. In place of Hanni, Crowleypicked up a new German Scarlet Woman, Frau Bertha “Billy” Busch, who bore asuggestive nickname, “the Red Angel.”59 If that indicated her politicalpredilections, it would fit the Beast’s other affiliations. He and Bertha foughtfrequently and ferociously, and on one occasion Crowley was pummeled by NaziBrownshirts who took offense at his slapping around a German woman on thestreet.Crowley’s diary entry for 6 October 1931 mentions two familiar names, vonAlvensleben and Arnoldo Krumm-Heller. He first mentions a call from “Frau v.Alvensleben,” who rang him to voice concern about “Germer’s insanity.”Presumably this had to do with Germer’s treatment by Adler, although herinterest in it is a puzzle. As noted previously, this Frau von Alvenslebenundoubtedly had some relation to Alvo von Alvensleben. Most likely she wasAlvo’s Canadian wife, Mary, since the couple visited Germany in this period. Itagain raises the intriguing possibility not only of a past but also an ongoingrelationship between Alvo and the Beast.As for Krumm, the Mage records that he called with a mysterious“anthropophagist” (more probably an anthroposophist than a cannibal), “Muller.”Krumm could have provided a link to another old associate then in Berlin, HannsHeinz Ewers. Ewers had become cozy with the Nazis, as had Krumm, affordingCrowley even more sources in that camp.Crowley also consorted with an assortment of British expatriates in Berlin,among them the writer Christopher Isherwood. Most important to us, though, wasone of Isherwood’s gay friends, an Irish journalist named Gerald Hamilton, whomCrowley let crash at his apartment for a while. This was not altruism; Col.Carter was paying the Beast to keep an eye on the Irishman. Hamilton was aformer friend of Roger Casement and had served time in British jails during WWIfor his Republican and pro-German sympathies. In Berlin, Hamilton had areputation for having lots of money and for being a spy, although no one wassure whose. He had ties to the IRA, which was still seeking help from theSoviets in its diehard struggle against London and Dublin. Thus, Hamilton was aufait with Communist activities in the German capital, even while he propitiatedGerman authorities by informing on his Red friends. He also supposedly kept themapprised of the doings of the dubious Englishman Crowley.Hamilton recalled his first brush with the Mage in fall 1930. Crowley’s diaryrecords frequent meetings with the Irishman from October 1931 through thefollowing June, with Hamilton moving in during January. On 1 February 1932, theBeast recorded that “H.[amilton] arrived [from London] with £50 from Yorke.”Yorke, it seems, was still playing case officer, but the money came from Carter,in payment for a report Crowley had provided on Hamilton. Hamilton later saidthat he had had no inkling of this, until Yorke “gave me proof” after Crowley’sdeath.60Hamilton was by no means Crowley’s only link to the Reds. By far, his mostimportant Communist contact was still Louis Gibarti. Gibarti struck many as aslightly comical “opera cavalier,” but he was a deadly serious and cleverconspirator and a kingpin of the Comintern’s operations in the West.61 His mainduty was creating and running front organizations such as the League againstImperialism (LAI) and an array of “peace” and disarmament groups. Gibarti alsowas an active agent of the OGPU and Soviet military intelligence.62MI5 and SIS were aware of the Crowley-Gibarti connection. Buried in Gibarti’sMI5 dossier is a 1933 letter from MI5 to SIS stating that “Gibarti has recentlybeen in touch with Alesteir [sic] Crowley in connection with LIA activities.”63“LIA” must be a typo for “LAI.” Officially, Gibarti had severed ties to the LAIin 1928, which raises the questions how and why he and the Beast were stillassociated with it some six years later. More intriguingly, the LAI’s roots ledstraight back to the League of Small and Subject Nationalities, the radicalentity earlier linked to Crowley, Dudley Field Malone, and John De Kay.In his role as an OGPU (later NKVD) operative, Gibarti played a part in groomingthe most infamous British traitor of the twentieth century, the Soviet mole andfuture SIS officer Kim Philby.64 Thus Gibarti indirectly connects Crowley to thenotorious “Cambridge Five” spyring. The Ring’s recruiter at Cambridge was theSoviet agent Semen Rostovskii (a.k.a. Ernst Henri), a protégé of Moscow’s thenambassador in London, Ivan Maiskii—whose name will later be linked to Crowley’sby none other than Philby.Rostovskii’s operation got underway in 1933, around the time the Gibarti-Crowleynote was written. One of Rostovskii’s accomplices was the young Cambridgecommunist Brian Howard. He, in turn, was a friend of Crowley’s erstwhileroommate, Gerald Hamilton.65 Howard also connects to another of the Mage’sleft-leaning homosexual associates, Tom Driberg, about whom more in thefollowing chapter.Gibarti also holds the key to Crowley’s link to Albert Einstein. In Berlin infall 1930, the Beast entertained his old friend John Sullivan and Sullivan’sfriend, the writer Aldous Huxley. Crowley is usually credited with introducingHuxley to the wonders of mescaline, but he also aided Huxley’s plan to interviewprominent men of science. On 3 October, the Mage’s diary records “wire Einsteinfor Huxley.”66 The question has been how Aleister and Albert could have knownone another. Although it is largely obscured by his scientific achievements,Einstein had a passion for pacifist and left-wing causes, many of them thehandiwork of Louis Gibarti. Gibarti knew Einstein well enough to provide allsorts of dirt on the physicist when he later turned FBI informant.67The Beast’s appearance in the Gibarti file coincides with an important change inhis own main MI5 dossier. In 1916 this file, #2573, bore the prefix “P.F.”(Personal File). By 1933, however, the file had added a “P.P.” prefix, asubcategory created late in WWI for “Peace Propaganda,” i.e. subversive pacifistactivity. The P.P. files came under the control of a special section of MI5,G-1, run by Victor Ferguson, an expert on Russian and Communist affairs. Almostevery P.P. laureate was a Communist or fellow traveler. The list includes Sovietpersonalities and pro-Red front groups such as the Women’s International toBritons such as George Lansbury, editor of the left-wing Daily Herald, andjournalists William Ewer, George Slocombe, and Arthur Ransome.Therefore, as far as MI5 was concerned, the Beast was a Red. Of course, thesewere the same people who had accepted that Crowley was a German propagandistduring WWI. Just as in 1914-1918, MI5’s apparent credulity about Crowley’sCommunist sympathies was a part of maintaining his operative cover, whether theyrealized it or not. During 1931, a major reorganization of the British secretservices consolidated counterintelligence under 5’s control, shifting mostcounter-subversion from Special Branch and SIS to MI5. Once again, Agent Crowleywas going to be under new management.The case of the above Arthur Ransome invites an illuminating comparison withCrowley’s. As a reporter in revolutionary Russia, Ransome was an outspokenadmirer of the Bolsheviks, especially Trotsky. He even ended up married toTrotsky’s secretary. In August 1918, however, the SIS station in Stockholmsecretly recruited Ransome as agent S76 and sent him back into Bolo-land.68 Theydid not inform MI5 or anyone else of Ransome’s true allegiance; all but a selectfew had to believe him to be a committed Red. Ransome spied on his Soviet hosts,undetected, until 1924. All the time MI5 dutifully included him in a P.P. listof thirteen “dangerous Bolsheviks” who were not to be allowed into Britain.69Just like Crowley, he was a suspect to one branch of British intelligence whilean asset for the other.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 “Le mysterieux visage d’Aleister Crowley—mage ou espion?,” unidentifiablepaper (17 April 1929).2 Mariel, 64.3 “La mystere de Sir Crowley: Espionage, magique noire, sadisme,” La Liberte (18April 1929).4 “English Nobleman’s Adventures in France,” Eastern Evening News [Norwich] (16April 1929).5 Dherelle & Lazareff, “Sir Aleister Crowley. . . ,” Paris-Midi (16 April 1929).6 Ibid.7 USNA, U.S. Army, General Staff, IRR file XE001752, “Final Report in the Caseof Walter Schellenberg, “30 Sept. 1946, Appendix XV, “Jahnke and the JahnkeBüro,” 2.8 The formal basis for this German-Soviet collaboration was the so-calledRapallo Treaty of early 1922, but secret negotiations had started a yearearlier.

"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THIRTEEN [../Text/contents.html] 047 [../Images/00002.jpg] A SMALL CIRCLE OF FRIENDS048 [../Images/00002.jpg] CROWLEY STAYED AROUND BERLIN through early 1932. In addition to his roommateHamilton, he was in regular contact with Gerald Yorke and Karl Germer. Bothwould have been useful for keeping tabs on British “renegades” living inGermany.One such dubious Briton was the convicted German spy and emerging Nazi VivianStranders. Another was Norman Baillie-Stewart, who aroused great interest inLondon. This disgruntled Army officer offered his services to the Germans in1930. The following year he showed up in the Reich to barter militaryinformation for cash and sexual favors. Someone kept London well apprised ofthese activities, and in 1933 MI5 placed Baillie-Stewart under arrest. He spentfive years in the Tower of London for violation of the Official Secrets Act.1During fall and winter 1931-1932, persistent rumors had Crowley materializing insupposedly forbidden Paris. As we know, he had secretly returned to France atleast once since his expulsion, so these rumors may well have been based onfact. In November 1931, American journalist Wambly Bald, another fascinated bythe Beast, noted recent reports that the infamous Mage noire had been spotted inhis old haunts in Montparnasse. Bald concluded that the rumors were unfounded,because “the notorious sorcerer has just sent us a letter to prove it.”2 If thetales were just flights of fancy, why did Crowley bother to deny them?George Langelaan’s recollections also speak of Parisian encounters with theBeast after 1929. Moreover, American writer Henry Miller remembered meeting theMage in Paris (and lending him money), and Miller did not set foot there untilspring 1930.3 A scrap of paper would never stop the Master Therion from doingwhat he willed. Practiced in slipping invisibly in and out of countries, heneeded only a fake ID and a fresh disguise. But what was he doing in France?In February 1932, Paris-Mardi made the sensational assertion that the “chief ofGerman counter-espionage” had come to Paris to deal with Aleister Crowley, whohad somehow become “compromised.”4 The German spymaster in question wasFerdinand von Bredow, head of the Abwehr. Bredow also was the right-hand man ofGen. Kurt von Schleicher, a rival of Hitler and contender for power in the dyingWeimar Republic. True or not, the story is further suggestion of a link betweenCrowley and German intelligence. If von Bredow was using our man, it was aslikely against German political opponents as the French. Politics certainly laybehind Crowley’s departure from Germany in June 1932. In this increasinglydesperate atmosphere, a new Chancellor took the stage. He was Franz von Papen,the Kaiser’s former military attaché in the United States and one of Crowley’s“co-conspirators” in the late war. Von Papen surely had not forgotten those daysor Crowley’s treachery. He also happened to be another deadly rival of Bredow’sfriend von Schleicher. If Crowley had colluded with either man, putting Berlinbehind him was a wise move.Things begged for Crowley’s attention back in England. One was the destitute andderanged Mrs. Crowley, now a patient at Colney Hatch asylum. Soon after hisreturn, he visited there but declined to actually see his wife. Instead, heschemed to get her to agree to a divorce and surrender rights to spousalmaintenance. She was not far gone. Another problem awaiting him at home was thedeparture of Gerald Yorke for the Far East. He was soon headed to China forReuters, and SIS. This meant the loss of a reliable and familiar intermediaryand probably the need for a new case officer.With or without Yorke, circumstantial evidence suggests that the Mage somehowremained in the intelligence loop. Back in London, he continued cultivatingCommunists and fellow travelers. For example, in August 1932, he approached theexpatriate American singer and actor Paul Robeson. Crowley wanted Robeson toplay the Othello-like role in a production of his play Mortadello. This may havebeen just another of Crowley’s half-baked schemes, but Robeson was an outspokenRed sympathizer, if not a formal member of the Party. Securing his cooperationwould have been further validation of the Beast’s own radical credentials.Crowley managed to wangle an interview with Robeson’s wife, but neither she norher husband took the bait.5Crowley’s diary for 13 October 1932 mentions a meeting with a Flight CommanderThorton (Thornton?) in London.6 There is no indication what it concerned, butany time a military officer shows up in the Beast’s company it is worth takingnotice. Robin Thynne also had a background in the RAF.In spring 1933, the Mage renewed acquaintance with the shipping heiress NancyCunard, whom he had known for some years. She had been one of the first personshe looked up when he first returned to Britain in 1929. Like Robeson, Cunard wasnever a full-fledged Comrade (so far as can be determined), but she was anotherpassionate advocate of avant-garde and left-wing causes and welcome in Communistcircles. That April, Crowley moved into the Astoria Hotel, where Cunard alsolived. As ever, how the supposedly broke Magician afforded such ritzy rooms is amystery. Within two days of his arrival, Crowley had insinuated himself intoCunard’s political activities, which centered on the black liberation movementand protesting racism in the United States. He lent his literary talents to aflyer she put together on the Scottsboro Boys case and was at her side at publicprotests.7 This also was around the time of his contact with Gibarti and theLeague against Imperialism. Cunard and her campaign were exactly the sort ofthings Gibarti sought to draw into his network, if they were not there already.Soon after sidling up to Cunard, Crowley made or renewed contact with anotherdenizen of the London’s avant-garde scene, Evan Morgan. This eccentric Welsharistocrat later inherited the family title and became Lord Tredegar. The Beastwas a regular guest at Morgan’s parties, which included the likes of AldousHuxley. When WWII began, Morgan, like so many of the Beast’s associates, foundhimself in intelligence, in his case a branch called MI8, the Radio SecurityService. The new Lord Tredegar maintained his reputation for eccentricity byadvocating bizarre, and disastrous, schemes involving carrier pigeons. Whatlanded the Lord in hot water, however, was the impromptu office tour he gave toa friendly young woman. Morgan ended up charged with treason before MI5intervened to get his release. That suggests that he and “5” had some specialrelationship. How far back might that have gone? It is said that in theaftermath of his arrest, Tredegar summoned Crowley to put a curse on the officerresponsible for the mess. As the story goes, the officer fell deathly ill.8Arguably Crowley’s most important contact in the British Left was Tom Driberg.The Beast had known him since the mid-1920s, when Driberg was an Oxford studentand aspiring occultist. They re-established contact when Crowley came back toLondon in summer 1932. In years to come, the talkative Driberg made various wildclaims about his relationship with the Beast, including being Crowley’s namedheir. Driberg also fabricated a tale about the grisly death of the Beast’s son“McAleister” during a miscarried occult working in Paris.9Driberg had been a Communist Party member since 1920. He also was a homosexual,like so many others Agent Crowley’s path had crossed.10 Despite (or maybebecause of) his politics and sexuality, Driberg had become a gossip columnist atthe Daily Express. Collecting gossip, after all, is just another way ofgathering intelligence. Driberg may have been informing to His Majesty’sauthorities for years, but about the time he renewed association with Crowley,Maxwell Knight, now employed by MI5, recruited him as an informant.11 Max usedDriberg to keep tabs on “café communists” and fellow-traveler liberals,precisely the crowd Crowley was so busy cultivating.Driberg introduced Crowley, if an introduction was necessary, to the writerDennis Wheatley (also linked to intelligence), and Wheatley then introduced theBeast to his friend Maxwell Knight. This occurred sometime in early 1937 or late1936. However, Knight, former intelligence chief for the British Fascisti,doubtless knew a little something about our man already.In private life, Knight was a joyful eccentric. In addition to dabbling in theBlack Arts, he enjoyed playing jazz and collecting exotic animals.12 He laterconfessed to his nephew that he and Wheatley “applied to Crowley as novices andhe accepted then as pupils,” but he also tried to pass off the interest as“purely academic.”13Similarly, Dennis Wheatley, “the prince of thriller writers,” explained hisinvolvement with Crowley as a way to collect details on black magic for hisstories. Wheatley, however, was much deeper into the occult than he publiclyadmitted, and convinced that the Beast possessed genuine mystical powers.14Among other things, Wheatley was connected with “Rosicrucian” sex ritesperformed by his aristocratic friends Charles and Joan Beatty. Joan Beatty(better known under her pen name Joan Grant) had an old association withCrowley. As a child, she and her family had sailed for the United States in 1914aboard the Lusitania, on the same voyage as Crowley. In New York, he became anoccasional (but not overly welcome) guest at their home. Perhaps her father wasinvolved in more secretive doings with their strange guest.15Wheatley’s own ties to intelligence predated the Second World War. In thatconflict, he would become a member of the super-secret London ControllingSection (LCS), a body presided over by Winston Churchill. The LCS oversawmilitary security, code-breaking, and deception.16 Another associate was PeterFleming. A curious detail about the LCS is that its “mascot” was a Romanstatuette of Pan, a deity Crowley knew well. Could its presence at thegatherings have been more than decorative?To understand what Knight was up to, we need to go back to that shake-up inBritish counterintelligence in 1931, which shifted him from SIS to MI5. Hebecame chief of MI5’s Section B5(b), also known as “M” Section, which kept trackof subversive threats to Britain and the Empire. Under Knight, “M” Sectionfunctioned as a practically independent agency. Its staffers did not show up onthe regular MI5 roster, and even Vernon Kell seems to have had little idea aboutwhat Max was doing and with whom.While initially focused on the Red Menace, by 1935 Knight and his outfit took onwatching fascists and pro-Nazis. Knight’s main weapon was the “mole” used toinfiltrate suspect organizations. He proved very effective in recruiting suchagents, one way or another. Crowley had years of perfectly apt experience and arich network of contacts ranging from Communists to German occultists. MaxKnight could also take special appreciation of Crowley’s expertise in the arcanearts.One tale concerning the two is that Knight’s first wife killed herself after an“occult experience with the notorious Aleister Crowley.”17 A past connectionbetween Mrs. Knight and the Mage is not out of the question, but there is noreal evidence that she and he ever so much as met on the street. Still, GwladysEvelyn Amy Poole Knight definitely did die in November 1936, about the timeCrowley went to work for her husband, and under questionable circumstances.An inquest established that Gwladys Knight succumbed to “poisoning by abarbiturate hypnotic prescription,” apparently an overdose of the painkillersshe took for back trouble.18 What the inquest left unclear was whether this wassuicide, accident, or murder. Maxwell came under suspicion: Gwladys had themoney in the marriage, and her substantial bank accounts passed to him. Maxadmitted not having lived with his wife since 1929, though (he said) they hadremained on friendly and even intimate terms. Some suspected that Max had killedhis unwanted spouse for her money. Crowley was an expert of sorts on drugs andcould have offered some pointers in making a fatal overdose look like a suicide.Clues to the strange relationship between Crowley and Knight may be hidden inthe same Italian dossier that notes the Beast’s Sicilian expulsion. At the leastits contents offer a glimpse into some the Beast’s more enigmatic connections inthe 1930s. These are letters from a mysterious Briton, identified only as “M,”to a Jesuit priest in Rome, Father Joseph Ledit. The French-born Ledit is aninteresting character in his own right. An expert in Russian and Slavicliterature and professor at the Vatican’s Pontifico Instituto Orientale, Leditassociated with the Collegium Russicum, a secretive body that trained priests toundertake missions in the Orthodox East, including undercover work in SovietRussia.19 Ledit had worked in the USSR incognito and was probably part of theVatican’s clandestine services. Some also associated him with George Monti, thedubious occultist who had proclaimed himself Crowley’s French representative inthe 1920s. On his own initiative or on orders from Jesuit higher-ups, Leditcompiled a detailed registry of occult and subversive groups. The Father was adie-hard anti-Communist and an active collaborator with Mussolini’s OVRA secretpolice.The first of the letters, dated 25 September 1935, makes no mention of Crowley.It is a query from “M” to Ledit concerning a “very remarkable English group”called “New Europe” or “New Britain.” “M” linked this group to psychoanalystAlfred Adler, whose name has come up in connection with Crowley, Germer, and theTavistock Clinic. “M” linked Adler and his International Society for IndividualPsychology to the Serbian writer and mystic Dimitrije Mitrinovic. “M” claimed tohave been investigating this nexus for “a year or two” and to have unearthed“startling European connections which might be of very grave import politically.. . .” The unstated suspicion seems to be that there was Communist influence onAdler, Mitrinovic, and friends.Mitrinovic had no evident link to the Beast, but he had lived in England since1914. He was close to one of Crowley’s literary and philosophical acquaintances,A.R. Orage, and was a devotee of both Steiner and Gurdjieff. Mitrinovic also wasan ardent follower of Adler and in 1927 set up a branch of the InternationalSociety for Individual Psychology in London. Five years later, he expanded thisinto the New Britain movement.20 New Britain had its roots in utopian schemessuch as Guild Socialism and the Social Credit Movement, long touted in Orage’sNew Age magazine. Mitrinovic and his ilk envisioned the reformation of societyinto a “threefold commonwealth” of autonomous political, economic, and culturalspheres, all run by a hierarchy of voluntary federations. It freely combinedelements of anarchism, Marxism, and fascist corporatism with Adler’s“Personalism” and more metaphysical notions borrowed from Steiner and Gurdjieff.Its “Do What Thou Wilt” ethic also was consistent with Thelema, as Crowley musthave noticed.The next item is a 16 April 1936 note from the Economic League’s John BakerWhite to “M” commissioning the latter to investigate Mitrinovic and hisorganization and offering to “pay for the work done on the usual basis.” “M”included this to explain the inquiry, and it suggests a long and closerelationship between “M” and Baker White. In an attached note to Ledit, dated 20April, “M” praised White as “a very practical worker” in the common cause. “M”asked Ledit for any information he had on Mitrinovic, “the key man of a verylarge organization.” “M” named another person involved, the journalist andeditor Philippe (or Philip) Mairet, a friend of Orage and the husband of theformer Ethel Coomaraswamy.21 She was the first wife of the Anglo-Indian writerand “Black Brother” Crowley had cuckolded and spied on in wartime New York. Ifnothing else, the Mage’s world could be oddly small.A month later, “M” finally brought Crowley into the picture. “I have been veryoccupied. . . ,” “M” explained, “with the special urgent investigation into thegroup calling itself XI Hour/ New Britain/ New Europe/ New Order.”22 This arraywas allied to a group in France, l’Ordre Nouveau.23 Still more tentacles reachedout to Vienna and Holland. Most provocatively and cryptically, “M” declared that“I am inclined to link [all these groups] up with ‘O.T.O.’—Ordo TempliOrientis—which makes it quite dangerous stuff to handle!” He added, “I expectyou have the O.T.O.—in its esoteric and exoteric name, C.C. [Celtic Church?]fully documented?” “M” then asked Ledit, “can you tell me anything of the lastten years, and especially the 1935- 1936 movements of the world famous Abister[sic] Crowley—and his many alias names [emphasis original]? “This is urgent,”“M” concluded, “. . . can you give me a description of him recently? Or adrawing? Especially of his head?”Besides enthusiasm for the “Threefold Commonwealth,” New Britain/l’Ordre Nouveauand associated groups all shared a commitment to European unification. Suchgroups were of keen interest to Crowley’s Commie friend Gibarti, so concernsabout Soviet penetration or manipulation may have been warranted. On the otherhand, l’Ordre Nouveau had more obvious cross-pollination with the French Fascistand esoteric Right, namely the sinister Mouvement Synarchique d’Empire and theterrorist Comite Secrete d’Action Revolutionaire, or Cagoule (“The Hood”).24Lurking in these same corners one again finds Crowley’s “representative” GeorgeMonti.25 The Synarchists or some kindred group may explain Crowley’s allegedbelief that an ancient and sinister secret society underlay the coming Vichyregime.26 This strange nexus at once seems to lead everywhere and nowhere. Maybethat is why “M” found it so interesting, and menacing.“M” never explains how Crowley fit into this picture or why the matter was sourgent. Evidently (s)he lacked recent knowledge of the Beast, including aphysical description. “M” could, however, peg him as “Frater Perdurabo” and linkhim to the A∴A∴, The Equinox, and the “temple” at Cefalu, but also repeated thefalsehood that Crowley “has been in Sing-Sing.” “M”’s odd fascination withCrowley’s head suggests a desire to make a physical comparison. Did “M” suspectthat the Beast was masquerading as someone else? It would not have been thefirst time.Who was “M”? A note in the Italian file states that Ledit identified his contactas female, personally known to him, and a person of “value and courage.”27 Thiswoman was well-disposed towards Fascism and recently had published a book onMussolini. The problem is that no British or other authoress fits this profile.The closest is Nesta Webster, who certainly admired Il Duce, was close to BakerWhite, and feared and loathed Crowley. She cannot be excluded as a possibility.Father Ledit pointedly declined to give his informant’s name to OVRA; he or “M”must have thought it vital to conceal. Also, Ledit kept “M’s letters and onlysupplied transcriptions to the secret police as further means of preservingconfidentiality. Perhaps Ledit presented “M” as female as misdirection toprotect the man behind the letters and copied the letters to hide his telltalemasculine handwriting.“M,” of course, is also the nickname used by Max Knight in MI5. Using it indealings with Ledit would not have been clever unless he could be the Fatherwould obscure his identity in other ways. Knight once had, and perhaps stillhad, Fascist sympathies, and had worked for Makgill’s spy outfit. He also hadlinks to Baker White. The mistaken reference to Crowley’s prison time in Americaand the picture of the OTO as the center of lurid conspiracies fits closely withthe view cherished and spread by Makgill & Co. when Knight worked with them.“M”’s evident lack of information about Crowley since the mid-1920s fits withKnight’s subsequent shift to SIS. If Knight was discreetly hunting for morerecent info on Crowley, Ledit would have been a good source. While the identityof “M” remains a mystery, all things considered, Maxwell Knight is the mostlikely candidate.After his return to England, Crowley renewed his campaign to rehabilitate hisreputation in the British press, with more unofficial help. During late June andearly July 1933, the Sunday Dispatch ran three lengthy pieces by Crowley,starting with “‘The Worst Man in the World’ Tells the Astounding Story of HisLife” and continuing with “I Make Myself Invisible” and “Black Magic Is Not aMyth.”28 They painted the Great Beast 666 as an unjustly maligned, colorfuleccentric, a benevolent practitioner of white magic who battled the forces ofevil. Moreover, he was, and had ever been, a true son of England.The Sunday Dispatch was another of Lord Rothermere’s papers, as kind to Crowleyas had been the Daily Sketch in 1929. By the early ’30s, Rothermere had becomeone more British cheerleader for Mussolini and Hitler as well as for suchhome-grown Fascists as Oswald Mosley. Rothermere met Hitler and lauded thebudding Third Reich as a “nation of ‘he-men’” which Britons should emulate.29Another of Rothermere’s friends, the familiar Col. J.F.C. Carter, was availableto point out the Beast’s recent service in the New Germany. Indeed, the first ofthe Sunday Dispatch series contained the infamous “Before Hitler was, I am”statement and took a strong pro-Hitler tone. At the same time, Rothermere wrotecolumns for his flagship Daily Mail heaping praise on the Führer.30Crowley next authored five articles in the Manchester Empire News, running fromSeptember to December 1933, with a sixth piece appearing in May 1934. Thisseries sang much the same song as above but contained more personal andsensational details. One installment, “They Called Me a Renegade,” contained theMage’s most candid remarks about his wartime activities in the U.S., includinghis work for the Admiralty and the Americans. In another, “The RidiculousAccusation,” he sought to set the record straight about his involvement with theoccult, placing himself well on the side of the benevolent “White Brotherhood.”The Empire News was not a Rothermere publication, but part of a syndicate run bythe Berry brothers, Gomer and William (later, respectively, Lords Kemsley andCamrose), who also ran the prestigious Sunday Times. The EN was a down-market,provincial paper with a yellow reputation. At the time, it was trying to gain awider readership and respectability, without abandoning its lucrativesensationalism. Mr. Crowley must have seemed an ideal subject.A few years later, however, Gomer Berry hired young Ian Fleming, the futurecreator of James Bond, to head a foreign desk. Fleming, as we will see, wouldlater find himself in Naval Intelligence and working with Crowley. Hisintelligence career almost certainly commenced in 1933, when he went to Moscowas a Reuters correspondent. There he covered the trial of some British engineers(including at least two past or present SIS operatives) accused of espionage andsabotage.31 At the same time, Crowley’s pal Gerald Yorke, also under Reuterscover, was busy spying in China alongside Ian’s elder brother, Peter, mentionedabove. Crowley may have known the Fleming brothers by the early 1930s. Theirmother’s paramour during the 1920s was the painter Augustus John, anotherfamiliar of the Beast.Crowley’s public relations offensive suffered a major setback in the spring of1934. Two years earlier, the sculptress Nina Hamnett had published a memoir, TheLaughing Torso. Hamnett had known Crowley for years, and to spice up her bookshe repeated some of the more lurid rumors about the Abbey of Thelema, includingthe tales of a missing infant and of the tragic death of Raoul Loveday. She didnot present any of it as verified or with any malice toward the Wickedest Man inthe World. Nevertheless, in April 1934 Crowley leapt off a precipice he alwayshad backed away from before: he sued Hamnett and her publisher for libel.32Perhaps he hoped that discrediting her stories would complete hisrehabilitation. He was also, as usual, broke, and the expected damages would puthim on easy street.He miscalculated gravely. Horrified spectators and an unsympathetic judge hearda parade of evidence, much of it the plaintiff’s own words, which made Crowleylook less like the incarnation of evil than like a despicable old cad andcharlatan. To compound his misfortune, after losing the lawsuit he ended uptried and convicted of “feloniously receiving” letters connected to the case.33Even another appeal to Admiral Guy Gaunt to come and defend his honor failed toelicit any open response. Far from restoring his finances, the fiasco pushedCrowley into bankruptcy, where he remained for the rest of his life.34If the Beast had been involved in only of a fraction of the clandestine affairswe have considered, he still would have been privy to many potentiallyembarrassing or damaging secrets. To leave such a man destitute and twisting inthe wind was dangerous. Bankrupt or not, in the aftermath of the trial, Crowleycontinued to live comfortably. As before, guardian angels seemed to shield himfrom utter ruin; he was never homeless or hungry, or unable to pay for hisweekly packet of heroin from the pharmacist. The common assumption is thatCrowley’s remaining faithful friends, principally Karl Germer, paid his bills.But they could not do everything; there must have been other helping hands,persons with an interest in the old man’s contented silence.For instance, during the trial and for the decade following, Crowley enjoyed theservices of the prominent West End solicitor Isidore Kerman, a noted bon vivant,real estate speculator, and later adviser to the press baron Robert Maxwell.35Kerman was best known as a high-profile and expensive divorce attorney. Unlesshe took on the Beast as a bizarre pro bono case, someone paid Kerman and keptpaying him for years. Kerman not only kept Crowley out of the poor house butalso helped keep his name—and his chatter—out of the papers.In the wake of the Hamnett trial a new woman appeared in Crowley’s life, thepretty nineteen-year-old Patricia Dierdre Maureen Doherty, whom the Beast dubbed“Pat.” According to legend, she ran up to him on the courthouse steps professingher admiration and offering to have his baby. Things did not quite happen thatway. At the time, Crowley’s Scarlet Woman was a thirty-something PearlBrooksmith, the widow of a naval (intelligence?) officer.36 Pat, too, wasromantically involved with someone else. She did give the Mage a son, but notfor another three years.Pat Doherty was the granddaughter of the well-known Cornish artist Thomas CooperGotch. Here, too, coincidences abound. Her father, Patrick Doherty, perished inSouth Africa during WWI doing “secret government work.”37 Abandoned by hermother, she was raised by her grandparents until Gotch’s death in 1931. Anautographed volume in Thomas Gotch’s library shows that he and Crowley knew eachother, probably from the Beast’s visits to Cornwall. They also shared a mutualacquaintance, Augustus John, de facto stepdad of the Fleming boys.When Pat Doherty met Crowley, she was enmeshed in a passionate affair with themuch older and married Robin Thynne, one of Crowley’s partners in the failedMandrake Press. Thynne, also known as Robert Thompson Thynne, has been aptlydescribed as a “mystery man.”38 He claimed to be a descendent of the notedElizabethan alchemist and Rosicrucian Francis Thynne, a contemporary ofCrowley’s hero John Dee. Thynne’s WWI service record shows his civilianoccupation as managing director of timber camps and lumber mills.39 He listedknowledge of German among his skills. During the war, Thynne became a major inthe RAF’s Technical Branch attached to the Ministry of Munitions. As such, hemay have worked on the development of bombs and rockets. His obituarycryptically notes that he “published several important scientific worksanonymously,” and that he and his work were “considered vital by certainauthorities.”40 Postwar, however, Thynne’s most obvious involvement was withquestionable business ventures. Besides the Mandrake Press, he ran at least twoshady companies, one of which became the focus of a scandal exposed by John Bullin 1928. Even Crowley once branded Thynne “a swindler and share-pusher of theworst type.”41Another odd thing about Thynne and Pat Doherty is that both were avowedfollowers of Rudolf Steiner’s Anthroposophy. How that meshed with theirallegiance to Crowley and Thelema is a puzzle. Perhaps it somehow relates to theodd WWI connection between Crowley and Steiner already discussed. Were theyreally “followers” of Crowley, or persons sent to watch and manage him? By theearly 1930s the Steinerites had become bitter foes of the Nazis, a factor thatmade them actual or potential allies in certain secret quarters.In 1932, Thynne, billing himself a “literary agent,” showed up in Cornwall andtook a house near Newlyn. According to police records, his real job wasrecruiting for an occult group headed by Aleister Crowley.42 One of his recruitswas a local teenager, Pat Doherty, who soon became Thynne’s lover and the “highpriestess” of the local band. The Cornwall “coven” connected to a larger groupbased in London. Other members of the Cornish crew included two local heiresses,Sheila and Marcia Hirst, and Wyn Henderson, a bohemian socialite and friend ofNancy Cunard. In the quaint town of Mousehole Henderson ran a restaurant, theLobster Pot, which served as meeting place for the group. Another devotee was alawyer, apparently of German-Jewish origin, Jacob Weinberg. He may have hadconnection to Isidore Kerman, who also was of Jewish background and a benefactorof German-Jewish refugees. Weinberg became very close to Pat Doherty, and laterjoined her in the Middle East during WWII. Was he, too, some sort of spy?Finally, there was a “rich man from the Midlands,” undoubtedly our old friendGerald Yorke.Two others connected to the Crowley and the Cornwall group were James MacAlpineand Greta Sequeira. On the eve of the war, MacAlpine worked for SIS’ Section D,a unit specializing in sabotage and assassination. It later became part of theSpecial Operations Executive, or SOE. MacAlpine has been described as a “JamesBondish sort of character” with the requisite taste for adventure and women.43At some point in the late 1930s, the Beast introduced him to Pat, and the twobecame an item. They married during the war, but MacAlpine perished on a missionin the Balkans. Pat herself then went to work for SOE as a code clerk. How andwhen did Crowley become so friendly with an SIS man? MacAlpine is one morecryptic thread linking the Beast to the intelligence world.Glamorous, twenty-nine-year-old Greta Sequeira was a close of friend of Dohertyand Thynne, and for a time a rival for Thynne’s affections. Like Pat and Thynne,she was also a devotee of Rudolf Steiner.44 Moreover, she was close to anotherof Crowley’s friends and collaborators, and yet another admirer of Steiner, LadyFrieda Harris. The exotic and rather mysterious Greta was the youngest daughterof Dr. William Sequeira, one of the physicians who worked on the Jack the Rippercase.45 Like Pat, Greta also aroused the interest of the still concupiscentBeast. Sequeira managed to keep him at bay, however; according to her, he nevergot her into bed despite all the charms he could muster. Maybe keeping thelustful old goat on the string was part of her job.Not surprisingly, Sequeira’s activities hint at intelligence work. During thelate 1930s, she made trips into the Third Reich and helped facilitate theescapes of “a number of Jewish doctors.”46 As mentioned, another benefactor toJews fleeing Germany was Crowley’s attorney, Isidore Kerman. Greta’s risk wasall the greater because she herself was of Sephardic Jewish ancestry. As ithappened, the SIS station chief in Berlin, Frank Foley, was engaged in similarsecret rescue efforts.47 Foley had been stationed in Berlin since the early1920s, which means that Crowley’s name must have come across his desk a fewtimes, each an opportunity for a deeper acquaintance. Foley recruited and ran anintelligence network of Jewish businessmen (like Weinberg). Finally, Sequeira’sGerman escapades coincide with Crowley’s own rumored late 1930s forays intoHitler’s domain.Another person who gravitated to Crowley in this period was twenty-somethingRobert “Robin” Cecil. The Cambridge-educated Cecil joined the Foreign Service in1936 as a specialist in German affairs. In addition to his interest in Crowley,Cecil studied Gurdjieff and his main expositor, P.D. Ouspensky.48 Cecil laterwrote on the evolution of Nazi ideology and penned a biography of Cambridge Ringspy Donald Maclean.49 His interest in espionage was not just academic; duringWWII, Cecil became personal secretary to Sir Stewart Menzies, then “C” (Chief )of SIS, and was the liaison between SIS and the Foreign Office. EverywhereCrowley turned, it seems, we find a spy.With that in mind, Robin Thynne, mentioned previously, merits a closer look.Like Gerald Yorke, Thynne’s association with Crowley looks like an assignment, anow familiar pattern. Thynne moved into Crowley’s inner circle just as Yorkedeparted the scene, which suggests that he took over the role of the Beast’scase officer.Throughout the early 1930s, Thynne made frequent trips to Switzerland,supposedly to visit the Rudolf Steiner Foundation headquarters at Dornach. Otherreports, however, claimed that the Swiss forays included liaison with a “richgroup of occultists,” presumably German exiles, who were plotting against theNazis.50 Some of these must have been Steinerites. Were there others from theOTO or Fraternitas Saturni? That may hold the key to Crowley’s relationship withThynne, Pat, and others.This is all the stranger because officially Anthroposophy took a dim view ofCrowley. As noted, Steiner’s successor, Walter Johannes Stein, painted him as a“black magician” and inspiration to Hitler.51 For his part, Stein also claimedto have been a “confidential adviser” to Churchill.52 MI5 documents do show thatStein undertook a special mission to Belgium early in WWII.53 In October 1939,Churchill’s close friend Admiral Sir Roger Keyes dispatched Stein to Brusselswith a confidential letter for King Albert. The mystically-inclined King was alongtime friend of Stein, who traveled with MI5 man Cecil Liddell, the brotherof B Division chief Guy Liddell.The approach to the Belgian Monarch was a cover for Stein’s real mission, tomake contact with a group of anti-Nazi “German aristocrats” who thought theycould force Hitler to abdicate or bring about his removal. Were they the samegroup Thynne had cultivated in Switzerland? On his return to London, Stein andLiddell reported to Churchill. The mission did not achieve any tangible success,and Stein’s subsequent activities were limited to “economic matters.”54Regarding Thynne’s mysterious government work, he may have been involved with ashadowy branch of the War Office initially known as “General Staff-Research”(GS-R), and later as MI-R. Its ostensible function was as a think tank for“irregular warfare,” including subversive propaganda and psychologicaloperations. Peter Fleming joined the same outfit, as did Col. Etherton’slongtime collaborator, L.V.S. Blacker. During WWII, MI-R merged into SOE,alongside MacAlpine’s Section D. A problem with the GS-R/MI-R scenario is thatThynne died before it officially formed. It stands to reason, however, that itor something like it existed earlier, perhaps since WWI.55 Could that be whereThe Cactus ended up?Another possibility is that Thynne was connected to a “private”intelligence-gathering organization that took shape during 1935-1936, dubbed“The Focus.” The man behind this was the disempowered Winston Churchill. TheFocus aimed to counter the growing threat of Nazi Germany, something thatWinston and others believed the Government did not take seriously enough.Moreover, the man running the information-gathering wing of The Focus was theBeast’s old boss, the venerable and ever-scheming Admiral Hall.56Arch-schemer and manipulator Hall, out of an official post since 1919, but neverout of the spying game, could have been the hidden hand behind Crowley’sintelligence employment between the wars. Through the likes of Feilding,MacBean, Burbury, Yorke, Carter, Thynne, and others, he could have kept theBeast on a leash, setting him loose when they needed him, and while he couldstill run.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 Baillie-Stewart returned to Germany after his release and became a Reichcitizen in 1940.

"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURTEEN [../Text/contents.html] 049 [../Images/00002.jpg] THAT OLD BLACK MAGICK050 [../Images/00002.jpg] IN JULY 1936, FIFTY-SEVEN-YEAR-OLD ROBIN THYNNE FELL ILL on his way back toLondon from Cornwall. His situation deteriorated rapidly. Desperate to save hislife, the British government flew in Dr. Ita Wegmann, a Swiss specialist inhomeopathic medicine affiliated with Anthroposophy. Her ministrations were of noavail. Like much of his life, Thynne’s funeral took place under a veil ofsecrecy. Another mystery is whether the devastated Doherty’s trip to Switzerlandafterward was a spiritual pilgrimage, an effort to complete Thynne’s unfinishedbusiness, or something of both. When she returned that fall, Doherty finallyoffered to bear Crowley’s child.1 Maxwell Knight also stepped into his life inthe wake of Thynne’s death. As ever, when one door closed, another opened.Thynne’s legacy lived on in a Cornish mystery involving Crowley, or at least hisname, and the usual intimations of clandestine doings. In spring 1938, unnamedpersons linked to the Thynne-Crowley coven were dwelling in a remote cottagenear the village of Tregrethen, not far from Land’s End. Their neighbors and theowners of the cottage were two respected locals, Will and Katherine “Ka”Arnold-Forster (a.k.a. Ka Cox). The story later circulated about the events of21-22 May went roughly thus: One night a frantic young woman knocked on theArnold-Forsters’ door and blurted out that “something terrible” had happened inthe cottage above. Ka accompanied her back to the place, where she discovered aman in a shocked or terrified state, and, supposedly, Crowley. Some sort ofviolent altercation ensued, possibly involving the Beast, and the result wasKa’s sudden death. The actual medical determination was heart failure, but therumor mill churned out more sinister explanations.The incident has been fictionalized at least twice, in A.L. Rowse’s A Night atthe Carn and Frank Baker’s Talk of the Devil, and most recently analyzed in PaulNewman’s The Tregerthen Horror.2 As that book makes clear, was Crowley nowherenear Tregerthen or Cornwall at the time; his diary puts him snugly in London. Hehad frequented that corner of Cornwall, however, and had met Pat and Greta therejust a few months later.But there were at least tangential links between the Beast and theArnold-Fosters. Both he and the pair affected leftist sympathies. The elfin WillArnold-Forster ardently promoted the League of Nations, making frequent visitsto its headquarters in Switzerland. Both Arnold-Forsters were active in theInternational Peace Campaign (IPC or Rassemblement Universel pour la Paix), apacifist-disarmament organization headed by Lord Cecil of Chelwood and theFrench Socialist politician Pierre Cot.3 Will had recently toured the LowCountries and Scandinavia on behalf of the organization, and IPC representativesattended Ka’s funeral.4 The couple were thus immersed in “peace propaganda,” thesame affiliation MI5 attributed to Crowley.The IPC originated at the Brussels World Peace Congress of 1936. Like theCongress, the Campaign was to some degree “Communist-influenced.”5 Crowley’sfriend Louis Gibarti and his boss Münzenburg helped organize the Congress, andMoscow sought to exploit the IPC as a propaganda vehicle and espionage front.Cot, for instance, turned out to be a Soviet agent who betrayed French militarysecrets.6 Someone could reasonably have suspected the Arnold-Forsters of likeproclivities.The picture, though, is complicated. Ka was close to members of the locallyprominent Bolitho family, several of whom looked very kindly upon Hitler. In1938, the Bolithos even played hosts to German Ambassador Joachim vonRibbentrop. Crowley knew some of the Bolitho clan and had performed rites ontheir Cornish property years earlier.7 Yet another of Ka’s intimates was LadyViolet Bonham-Carter, a key member of Churchill’s secretive anti-Nazi group, TheFocus.Paul Newman suggests that a key to what was going on at Tregerthen may liehidden in Frank Baker’s roman à clef, Talk of the Devil.8 Baker, who knew theArnold-Forsters well, thinly disguised them as the book’s central couple, theActons. Most of the other characters correspond to real persons, includingCrowley, who appears as the bloated and sinister occultist Nathaniel Sylvester.The real villain of the tale, however, turns out to be Paul Acton (WillArnold-Forster), who arranged for his wife to be frightened to death because shehad discovered his secret double life as a Nazi spy and mad scientist. Sylvester(Crowley) turns out to be a mere “decoy,” while a clever British secret serviceagent is on hand to monitor the suspect doings.Just how close did Baker’s fiction come to the truth? A man of WillArnold-Forster’s known political bent seems unlikely to have been a Nazi spy. Onthe other hand, a contemporary, Kim Philby, deliberately cultivated a reputationfor Fascist sympathies as a cover for his communist ones. Perhaps Will did theinverse by feigning leftist affinities. Or perhaps Baker fudged the truth bymaking a fictional Nazi out of a real-life Red agent.Venturing further, writer Steve Jackson speculates that Crowley had beenrecruited (probably by Max Knight) to run some sort of “occult training school”for selected agents.9 Using Thynne’s Cornwall coven as cover, the aged Magecould offer not only a wealth of arcane wisdom, but also a lifetime’s experienceof trickery and deceit, not to mention hypnosis and drugs. This scenario wouldexplain the bevy of occult-linked present and future spies—Doherty, Knight,MacAlpine, Sequeira, Wheatley, etc.—who whirled around Crowley in this period.Another possibility is that the Crowley-Thynne group was a counterintelligenceploy to attract, compromise, and recruit subversive elements. That, too,suggests Knight’s guiding hand. Occult rites, especially sexual ones, producedexcellent opportunities for blackmail. There are hints of something like thisgoing on in the early part of WWII. They surface in a report Soviet mole KimPhilby sent to his Moscow control in 1942.10 Philby noted that SIS wasinvestigating a “complicated racket” that linked RAF officers and members ofBritish high society to drug smuggling, sexual orgies (hetero and homo), andblack masses. Behind this scheme was the German Embassy in Dublin, which randrugs into England with the aid of Welsh fishermen and corrupt nightclub owners.The dope, orgies, gambling, and black masses were used to blackmail officersinto supplying information. Mingling in this weird milieu, along with a colorfulthrong of ladies, countesses, wing-commanders, and pornographers, were SovietAmbassador Ivan Maiskii and “the notorious occultist Aleister Crowley.”11Unfortunately, the charts mentioned by Philby, which might have clarified theseconnections, are missing.Philby and SIS may have stumbled on an MI5 operation (probably Knight’s)intended to ferret out security risks and enemy agents. MI5, after all, includedthe masterminds of the top secret and very successful “Double-Cross” system,which managed to transform most of the Nazi espionage network in Britain into avehicle for disinformation. The Soviet Ambassador’s presumed involvement in themurky doings would make a British agenda more likely than a German one, as wouldCrowley’s.After the war, self-proclaimed warlock Cecil Williamson alleged that he had beentapped by SIS on the eve of the Second World War to head a “Witchcraft ResearchCentre.”12 Williamson later became a founding father of modern witchcraft andthe curator of the Witchcraft Museum. The goal of his wartime outfit, heclaimed, was to discover who in the German High Command and Nazi hierarchy mightbe influenced by astrology or related superstitions. In this, Williamson claimedto have collaborated with Ian Fleming, Dennis Wheatley, and others definitelylinked to Crowley. Another part of Williamson’s alleged mission involvedinvestigating “a network spreading from Britain to Germany and Switzerland, withcontacts that penetrated the Abwehr.”13 That sounds like Thynne’s intrigues. Onthe other hand, Williamson also gained a reputation as a master fabulator.Nevertheless, Paul Newman, citing a source with access to classified SOE andPolitical Warfare Executive (PWE) files, believes that Williamson was telling atleast a version of the truth. Similarly, spy writer Donald McCormick (a.k.a.Richard Deacon) once observed that “[the British] might quite easily create acoven as a propaganda weapon against the Germans, but it would be highlyimpracticable to suggest that the Germans could do the same thing in reverse onour soil.”14 This, he insisted, was because the Germans were far more inclinedto take such things as witchcraft and astrology seriously. While that isdebatable, and McCormick earned a reputation for sensational and unsubstantiatedstatements, he did spend WWII in British Naval Intelligence working with thelikes of Ian Fleming. He may have learned more about this exotic branch ofspycraft than he let on.Still, why would anyone have picked the relatively callow Williamson over theseasoned Mage to run an occult outfit? At sixty-five, Crowley was not all theway over the hill. In fact, he was a year younger than Churchill. On the otherhand, he was a hopeless drug addict in failing health. A bigger problem, though,and one that Williamson did not have to bear, was the Beast’s toxic reputationand the fear and revulsion his name aroused inside and outside Governmentcircles. Just as in 1914, Mr. Crowley could have his uses, but never in anyofficial capacity.The use of astrologers by British intelligence is confirmed by wartime MI5 chiefGuy Liddell, whose diary entry for 10 April 1941 includes this revealing note:> DNI [Director of Naval Intelligence Admiral John Godfrey] is employing Louis> de Wohl to read horoscopes of the most important Admirals in the navy and> those of Hitler, Mussolini, Darlan, and Portal. Merritt of NID is his> intermediary. It is believed that DNI himself is a strong believer in> astrology. On the other hand it may be that since Hitler works on these lines> and de WOHL is acquainted with the workings of Hitler’s astrologer [illegible]> hopes to work out the most propitious [time] for Hitler to act. The whole> business seems to me to be highly misleading and dangerous.”15This shows that some decision-makers in British intelligence not only embracedastrology as a weapon, but also, contrary to McCormick, took it seriously.McCormick himself also noted that “the links between occultism and astrology onthe one hand and intelligence work on the other, though obscure, havenonetheless existed through the Middle Ages to the present day.”16As for McCormick’s contention that the Germans were more susceptible to suchstuff, as noted the Nazi leadership definitely was full of believers, among themHeinrich Himmler, Rudolf Hess, and to some degree Hitler himself. They certainlywere concerned enough about occult organizations to suppress them. Early in1935, The Nazi regime initiated what author Peter Levenda aptly describes as a“cult war” against “Masonic lodges, other lodges and lodge-likeorganizations.”17 Besides all forms of Freemasonry, the Nazi crackdown includedSteiner’s Anthroposophy, the Theosophical Society, and even the venerableDruiden-orden. Also on the Nazi hit-list were the Golden Dawn, Grosche’sFraternitas Saturni, the OTO, and Crowley’s A∴A∴; that is, every esotericorganization the Beast ever had anything to do with.The Third Reich had room for only one secret society, Himmler’s own “BlackOrder,” the SS. Himmler viewed other groups not just as rivals but as securitythreats. For instance, he believed that Rosicrucianism was a “branch of theBritish secret service.”18 Donald McCormick argues that Himmler arrived at thatconclusion “through knowledge of Crowley’s activities,” though he does notexplain how Himmler knew about them.19 One source could have been the Beast’searlier collaboration with the Weimar era’s Abwehr under Ferdinand von Bredow.The SS executed Bredow in 1934 but the Nazis inherited his files.Heinrich Himmler was arguably “a full-fledged man of magic.”20 He conversed withspirits and had his own Rasputin in Karl Maria Wiligut, a former Schlaraffen whopreached a bizarre amalgam of racist pseudo-history and rune-magic.21 In 1935,Himmler assumed control of the Ahnenerbe (Office of Ancestral Research),sometimes referred to as the SS “Occult Bureau.” While only a fraction of theAhnenerbe’s more than fifty sections investigated the occult or paranormal,these were serious priorities. Himmler also created a Hexen-Sonderauftrag(Witchcraft Special Commission) aimed at recovering the supposed “lost wisdom”of the German Volk.22Still, Himmler had nothing on Rudolf Hess, former devotee of the Thule Societyand student of Karl Haushofer. Hess was a firm believer in astrology and unlikemost of his fellow Nazis retained a certain admiration for Rudolf Steiner, justlike many in Crowley’s prewar entourage. Even Hitler’s cynical propagandaminister Joseph Goebbels formed a special section to exploit “astrology,metapsychology and occultism.”23 He believed that the “Americans and Englishfall easily to this kind of propaganda.”24 In 1940, Goebbels schemed to use theprophecies of Nostradamus to “prove” the inevitability of German victory.Like all the organizations to which he belonged, Crowley was officially verbotenin the Third Reich. Karl Germer tasted this hostility first-hand. He hadaccompanied Crowley back to England in 1932, but for unstated reasons the HomeOffice declined to extend his visa in late 1934. Germer ended up back in theReich just as the Nazi hammer came down on occultists. His deportation may nothave been a mere matter of blind bureaucracy and bad timing. If Crowley had usedGermer as a British asset, his deportation was a means to get him back intoGermany with the advantage of an apparent grudge against England. The Gestapoarrested Germer in Leipzig on 2 February 1935 and charged him with recruitingfollowers for the “high-grade Freemason Aleister Crowley.”25 Germer spent thebetter part of the next six months in the SS-run Esterwegen concentration camp.It seems suicidal for Crowley to have set foot in Germany after 1934, yet thereare stories of him doing just that, and given his past behavior in France, itshould not be ruled out. He could have resorted to the trusted and simpleexpedient of a false identity. Germer’s case also suggests that the Beast stillhad some friends in the Reich. Germer got out of internment in August 1935 andin October somehow reached England via Belgium. In Leipzig, his friend FrauleinKuentzel continued to operate the Thelema Verlag, which openly produced and soldCrowley and OTO materials, until 1937. Who or what granted her the specialdispensation?On 30 July 1936, Crowley memorialized an interesting luncheon in his diary.Joining him were the recently arrived Germer, “girl Pat” (Doherty), and anunknown “Rudy” (not Hess, certainly). The guest of honor was another oldacquaintance, George Sylvester Viereck, on his way to or from Germany. Viereckhad not abandoned his pro-Germanism, and he had become an outspoken admirer ofHitler and National Socialism. Back in America, Viereck became a blatant Nazipropagandist, a role that led to his arrest and imprisonment during the war.Only in Crowley’s small, strange world would a pro-Nazi would be breaking breadwith an undesirable leftist foreigner he knew to have been connected to Britishintelligence.Crowley’s recollection of the conversation makes the picture even odder.According to the Mage, Viereck agreed to sign an affidavit attesting thatCrowley “had no troubles with authorities in U.S.A.”26 The German-American alsoadmitted that after WWI, “he made friends with our N[aval] I[ntelligence] chiefswho told him that I had been working for them during the war.” So, Viereck notonly had somehow gained the confidence of NID, but also would vouch for a manwho had tricked and betrayed him. Maybe Viereck was just the forgiving type, butmore probably he had been, just as we have supposed, a British double agent.Maybe he still was. Viereck, too, could have provided the Beast with some usefulchannels in Germany.Another detail suggesting that someone was running interference for Crowleyinside the Third Reich is that his name is missing from theSonderfahndungsliste-GB, the “special arrest list” compiled by the Gestapo andSS in 1940 in anticipation of the occupation of Britain.27 Among its roughly2,000 names are many real or suspected intelligence operatives (including SidneyReilly, supposedly dead since 1925) and persons connected to Freemasonry andother esoteric societies. That the Nazi compilers overlooked a world-infamousoccultist with long-known connections to Germany and British secret service isstrange indeed.Despite ruthless repression, the Nazis still had plenty of enemies in theirmidst. One such group was the Tatkreis (“Action Circle”), a shadowy cabal of“conservative revolutionaries,” which included former Thule Society members andassociates of the murdered Ferdinand von Bredow.28 The Tatkreis took credit,rightly or wrongly, for Georg Elser’s attempted assassination of Hitler inNovember 1939.29 It maintained ties to anti-Hitler elements abroad, and verylikely was the group Walter Stein had hoped to contact in Belgium. It may alsohave included the mysterious persons Thynne schemed with in Switzerland.A key figure in the anti-Nazi underground was another familiar figure fromCrowley’s WWI days, Kurt Jahnke. Even though “he hated Hitler and nearly allNazis” and had past ties to von Bredow and Soviet intelligence, Jahnke somehowsecured the confidence and protection of Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess. Moreover,Hess chose Jahnke to run a special intelligence bureau, “Abteilung Pfeffer.”30The main aim of this outfit was the “strengthening of Anglo-German relations bya mutual, unfettered exchange of views.”31 Jahnke’s activities extended toSwitzerland, where he traveled frequently. That, too, suggests a connection toThynne, and thence to Crowley.In 1935, Jahnke arranged a Berlin meeting between Hess and a “British secretservice man,” F.C. (or J.C.) Fletcher, who attended with the approval of hissuperiors.32 Did Jahnke, using his influence with Hess, also arrange forCrowley’s clandestine visits, to meet with his boss or others?In 1937, Jahnke, still working for Hess, tried and failed to bring about “acomprehensive agreement between Britain and Germany worldwide.”33 In pursuit ofAnglo-German comity, Jahnke also employed agents in England who establishedcontact with a pro-Nazi group, the Link. Its adherents included occult expertArthur Rogers, ex-NID chief Admiral Barry Domvile, and Crowley’s old chum J.F.C.Fuller.One man vitally interested in the Link was Maxwell Knight. His successfulinfiltration of the organization helped compromise the Nazi “Fifth Column” inBritain and was a masterpiece of counterintelligence. Crowley’s personalknowledge of some of the members, his mastery of the occult beliefs thatmotivated them and others, and his possible access to Jahnke’s or other Germanchannels would have made him a valuable asset to Max.Knight no doubt was interested in the Beast’s contact with another German whoarrived in Britain in early 1939. Indeed, MI5 would amass a five-volume dossieron him.34He was Col. Hans Kahle, a former officer of the Kaiser who became aCommunist and Soviet agent in the 1920s. He most recently had served the Partyin the Spanish Civil War where he started out commanding a contingent in theInternational Brigades and ended up leading a whole Republican division. Hesupplemented his military duties with service to Stalin’s NKVD. Kahle knewJahnke and undoubtedly had ties to Crowley’s Comintern contact Louis Gibarti. InLondon, he assumed the mantle of a “political journalist” while continuing toact on the orders his masters in Moscow. On 19 March 1939, Crowley’s diaryrecords a lunch with “Col. Kahle” and three others, Knight’s informer TomDriberg, composer Constant Lambert and writer John Rayner.35 The Beast’spresence at the table may have stemmed from his outspoken support for theSpanish Republic (befitting his leftist affectations), but it seems unlikelythat this meeting with an important Communist operative was a purely casualaffair.Driberg’s presence at the gathering also is interesting. He and Crowley remainedin fairly regular contact right up to the war and beyond, although the Beastseems to have become less and less tolerant of his manners. The frequency oftheir meetings suggests that Driberg may have been acting as cut-out for Knight.Knight also must have taken some interest in the Master Therion’s ongoingcontacts with Gerald Hamilton, the pro-Communist journalist whom Crowley hadbefriended and spied on in pre-Hitler Berlin. For instance, “Ham” (Hamilton)shows up in the Beast’s diary of 23 August 1939, where Crowley notes seeing him“en route for Paris.”36 He is there again on 2 October where Crowley mentionshaving “conferenced” with him.37 Not long after, the government internedHamilton as a potential security risk under Defence Regulation 18B. The orderallegedly came straight from Churchill. The official reason was that Hamiltonhad suspicious communication with the German Embassy in Dublin. Could that havehad anything to do with the drug-running plot mentioned by Philby, also based inthe Dublin Embassy? As before, there is a sense of looking at scattered piecesof some great jigsaw puzzle. In any case, note that Crowley, who supposedly borea black mark against his name because of his dalliance with the enemy in theFirst War, and now associate of the likes of Hamilton, was entirely unmolested.In fact, he resumed relations with Hamilton after the latter’s release.Back in Berlin, some Nazis were convinced that Jahnke was a British doubleagent, but they could not get enough on the slippery Prussian to prove it. Onewas the chief of Himmler’s Sicherheitsdienst, Reinhardt Heydrich, who was surethat Jahnke’s real purpose in visiting Switzerland was to exchange informationand receive orders from British intelligence.38 Had Jahnke been one of Thynne’scontacts?Under the circumstances, Heydrich immediately cast suspicious eyes in Jahnke’sdirection when, on 10 May 1941, Rudolf Hess flew a Messerschmidt-110 to Scotlandon his infamous and abortive mission to broker peace between London and Berlin.In the resulting Aktion Hess, Jahnke narrowly avoided arrest or worse, butnumerous occultists, especially astrologers, were not so lucky.Jahnke surely had some hand in convincing Hess to undertake the gambit, but hedid not act alone. Whatever he did to drive Hess toward his fatal decision waslinked to a larger plot in London orchestrated by Crowley’s “friends” DennisWheatley and Ian Fleming and Fleming’s boss, NID chief Admiral John Godfrey.Fleming, for instance, practically ran a secret section, 17Z, that workedclosely with Wheatley, the abovementioned astrologer Louis de Wohl, and a “blackpropaganda” outfit run by the Political Warfare Executive’s Sefton Delmer.39Crowley would have been an ideal adviser to such a group.Additional inspiration on the Hess front came from Ian’s brother Peter Fleming.In 1940, he began writing a novel called The Flying Visit, which offered theprovocative scenario that Adolf Hitler flew to England and ended up in Britishhands. The reality was that the war was going very badly for Britain at thispoint. Hitler had yet to entangle himself in Russia, and American interventionwas nowhere on the horizon; Britain stood alone. Many in the establishment,including some in Royal circles, felt that a deal with Germany was the smartmove.40 Others, such as Churchill, looked for a way to confound the Nazis andbuy precious time.A part of this complex scheme involved Albrecht Haushofer, the son of Hess’mystical mentor Karl Haushofer. Albrecht knew Hess, was a secret anti-Nazi, andwas a close friend of the Scottish Duke of Hamilton, who was affiliated with theBritish “peace party.” By manipulating correspondence between Haushofer andHamilton, Fleming and his crew hoped to convince Hess that the peace party wasready to oust Churchill and make a deal.41 When this effort fizzled, AdmiralGodfrey and Fleming hit on another approach: using cooked astrology to persuadethat his cause and timing were right. This was the plan Guy Liddell detected anddisapproved of. In the end, Hess used astrological readings concocted fromvarious sources to pick 10 May as der Tag. Apparently the fact that the 10th hadthe sun and four planets in Taurus he considered highly significant.The Beast’s name comes up in discussions of a variety of “occult operations”during WWII. He personally claimed to have given Churchill the “V for Victory”sign, which really was, the story goes, the powerful occult symbol of Apophisand Typhon. Weirder tales involve the Mage’s name, and sometimes his person, inan alleged effort by British witches to ward off Nazi invasion through forestgatherings and magic rituals.42 Such tales probably best belong in the largefile of Crowley apocrypha, but they may have their origin in the campaign of“occult disinformation” waged by elements in British intelligence.Among the factors that led Hess to undertake his daring flight was a peculiardream. He found himself in Buckingham Palace, being received by the King. Hesstook this as another auspicious sign. This has led some to speculate thatCrowley used his special talents to literally get inside Hess’ head and inspireor influence this dream. While obviously beyond objective proof, the notion isnot as farfetched as it sounds. The same concept lies behind today’s “remoteinfluencing,” a psychic technique experimented with by the U.S. Army and theCIA, among others.43Whatever Crowley’s role in the Hess affair, there is no doubt that he rekindledhis relationship with NID when war came. On 8 September 1939, only days afterBritain’s declaration of hostilities, the Mage noted that he had “completed formfor NID,” which sounds like a questionnaire or application. Immediatelyfollowing, he lists four names: “Sir P.[ercy] Harris. C. Bax. G.[erald] J.Yorke. C.R. Cammel.”44Percy Harris was the husband of Lady Frieda Harris, the artist who paintedCrowley’s Tarot deck. He also was a Liberal M.P. and later a privy counselor andmember of Churchill’s wartime circle. Only a few weeks earlier, Crowley recordedthat he had “educated” Harris about something and the next day Harris arrangedthe Beast a visit to a meeting of Parliament.45Our man still was not without afew friends in high places. The writer Clifford Bax was an old acquaintance whohad introduced Crowley to Frieda Harris. His interests included astrology andTheosophy, and he just may have had some connection to intelligence. GeraldYorke we know, and Cammell, another writer, would pen an early and rathersympathetic biography of the Beast, The Black Magician, in 1951. The names looklike a list of personal references.Crowley must have done something right, for on 10 September he received apersonal reply from Admiral Godfrey, DNI. The Admiral offered his complimentsand summoned the Mage for an “interview,” suggesting that Crowley contactCommander C.J.M. Lang of the Naval Intelligence Division to set up a time. Hehelpfully provided Lang’s telephone number: Whitehall 9000, Ext. 484. On thenote, Crowley jotted: “Better ring up Mr. Frost—Ext. 46 for an interview?”46Commander Lang’s connection to Naval Intelligence went back at least to 1919 andtook root in the Far East. The latter recalls Burbury’s, Etherton’s, andCrowley’s earlier interest in “Oriental Evil.” During 1932-1934, Lang was NIDchief in Hong Kong, coinciding with Yorke’s and Peter Fleming’s missions inChina. His service record shows that he returned to active duty with NID inAugust 1939. Although the file reveals nothing about his exact assignment, hisextension, #484, was used by “the NID section dealing with the interrogation ofPOW’s.”47 Remember that Crowley had conducted hundreds of “experiments” withpeyote and other drugs and had kept copious notes on the results—furtherexpertise useful to Godfrey and his lieutenants, with or without Hess.Crowley’s “Mr. Frost” is harder to pin down. “Extension #46” existed in NID, butwas assigned to a senior civil servant, W.G. Johns. Given the Beast’s penchantfor nicknames, perhaps “Frost” was his for Johns. In any case, why Crowleythought it best to contact him first remains a mystery.Two days after his invitation from Godfrey, the Beast recorded a rather crypticentry that includes “Interview as satisfactory as could be expected,” what looksto be a Hebrew code for “NID” and “Job from umbilicals.”48 The latter seems tobe his personal code for NID or some related branch of officialdom. Alsomentioned is a letter from “V. I.”, certainly Volo Intelligere (Gerald Yorke). Afollowing entry on 2 October mentions “Col. Ellachie or Commdr. Leeds” and“Executed Harris’ mission: better that I had ventured to hope.” The same entryalso notes the recent conference with Gerald Hamilton and letters from theGerman-sounding H.L.M. Gertz and Kraemer.The man who became the NID’s point man on the “Crowley business,” effectivelyhis case officer, was Godfrey’s assistant Ian Fleming. Fleming later recalledhow Crowley “put forward some madcap ideas to the intelligence authorities . . .one being dropping occult information [on the enemy] by leaflet.”49 Supposedly,the idea went nowhere, yet Delmer’s and other agencies engaged in almostidentical activities, whether or not inspired by Crowley.Fleming later confessed that one of his unfulfilled desires was to have Crowleyinterview Rudolf Hess.50 That would make perfect sense if the Beast was alreadyinvolved in prisoner interrogations. Crowley was willing to oblige, and may havesuggested the idea himself. Fleming preserved a letter from him, dated 14 May(four days after Hess’ capture), which read: “If it is true that Herr Hess ismuch influenced by astrology and magick, my services might be of use to thedepartment in case he should not be willing to do what you wish.”51Interestingly, Crowley noted Tom Driberg as someone who “could testify to mystatus and reputation in these matters.”52 Had he been doing similar work forMaxwell Knight? Fleming and Godfrey hoped that the old Magician might persuadeHess to divulge intimate details about other top Nazis, such as the degree oftheir own occult susceptibilities.Officially, the Beast never got anywhere near Hess. There were, after all,concerns about Rudy’s mental stability, and who knew what impact Mr. Crowleymight have on that. Fleming attributes the decisive veto to Maxwell Knight.53This seems odd, since Knight theoretically had no jurisdiction over NID or Hess(who was MI6’s responsibility). But Knight could claim a prior proprietaryinterest in Crowley, and may have objected to Fleming poaching his man. MaybeKnight had his own scheme for getting Hess and Crowley in a room together.By one account, Crowley did interrogate Hess, not at MI6’s Camp Z (MytchettPlace), but at a secret MI5 facility. This was Camp 020, otherwise known asLatchmere House or Ham Common.54 According to information received by researcherPeter Koenig, the Beast interviewed Hess there over a three-week period,sometime between Hess’ arrival in London in May 1941 and his transfer to amental hospital in Wales in June 1942.55 The original source of the tale is aGerman POW who claimed to have seen the Mage and Hess at the Camp. Ham Commondefinitely was a top-secret center for interrogation, often rough, of selectGerman prisoners. At least two of them, Kurt Maass and Eduard Semelbauer, wereclose to Hess, and he had asked to see them after his capture.The official chronology of Hess’ captivity, however, reveals no opportunity fora three-week visit, or any visit to Latchmere House. Perhaps the prisoner didsee Crowley there on other business, and falsely assumed that it had to do withHess. On the other hand, if Max Knight wanted to probe Hess on the sly, a securelocation like Ham Common would have been perfect.A final curious detail: at Camp Z, Hess complained of hallucinations andprotested to Red Cross officials that his food was being dosed with “Mexicanbrain poison,” i.e. mescaline.56 Was Hess just losing his mind, or was someoneusing Crowley’s bag of tricks? As Donald McCormick later observed, “if oneexamines the remarkable story of Rudolf Hess . . . the triangle of witchcraft,astrology and espionage becomes strangely more predominant.”57 Crowley’sconnection to all this leaves us a trail of provocative facts and intriguingrumors, but no clear answer.In early 1942, the Beast put forward what may have been his last proposalregarding clandestine warfare. He called it “Plan 241.” Fleming and Godfreyhaving moved on to other pastures, he used as intermediary his friend andstudent Robert Cecil. Cecil was in the Foreign Office but had connections in the“spookier” corners of the wartime government. On 14 January, the Beast notedthat he had an “excellent talk” with Cecil and that he “agreed to get Plan 241to Col. Britton personally.”58The latter was attached to Delmer’s PoliticalWarfare Executive. Cecil later described the Plan as “black propaganda” that was“as black as black could be.”59 He is sparse with details, but the gist of itwas the deliberate recruitment of persons “whom despair had rendered not onlymurderous, but suicidal.” Such an operative would slay two Germans and then killhimself, leaving “241” somewhere on his corpse. Crowley hoped that this mightencourage spontaneous copycat attacks by other desperate men. Cecil noted onlythat the Plan “did not find favor.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 The child, Randall Gair (later called Aleister Ataturk), was born in May 1937.2 Frank Baker, Talk of the Devil (London: Angus & Robertson, 1956), and A.L.Rowse, A Night at the Carn and Other Stories (London: William Kimber, 1984).3 Lord Edgar Algernon Robert Gascoyne Cecil (1864-1958).4 The Times (13 Jan. 1938), 9g, and (28 May 1938), 16d.5 Ursula Langkau-Alex, “The International Socialist Labor Movement and theElimination of the ‘German Problem’,” 7-8, www.iisg.nl/publications/respap29.pdf[http://www.iisg.nl/publications/respap29.pdf].6 Gary Kern, A Death in Washington: Walter G.

"},{"pageContent":"EPILOGUE [../Text/contents.html] 051 [../Images/00002.jpg] THE DISHONORABLE GENTLEMAN052 [../Images/00002.jpg] WHATEVER HIS INVOLVEMENT IN THE HESS CASE OR OTHER CLANDESTINE ACTIVITIES,CROWLEY WAS NOT SHY about showing his patriotism. In 1941, he wrote Thumbs Up!,a small volume of verse that included “England, Stand Fast!” (dedicated toWinston Churchill) and “A Toast,” a parody that harked back to his “German”propaganda in the last war. To some, it was just an aging petty traitor’scynical effort to rehabilitate himself. On the contrary, these outpouringsprobably reflected the genuine sentiments which stirred his Tory heart ofhearts.The Mage’s last years saw a final burst of literary work, including thecompletion of Magick without Tears (published posthumously in 1954) and The Bookof Thoth (1944). But the notorious Aleister Crowley was a sick man sufferingfrom bad teeth, chronic bronchitis, and a failing heart. His lifelongrespiratory problems and the years of abuse, narcotic and otherwise, had takentheir toll. Even his vaunted libido was on the wane, though apparently he stillmanaged to attract a string of willing (if sometimes ambivalent) partners.1The war buffeted him from one place to another. In 1940, he was bombed out ofthe London suburb of Richmond Green and left for the relative security ofTorquay (near Cornwall). Pushy creditors (and perhaps other obligations) drovehim back to London, where by late 1942 he lived in a flat at 93 Jermyn Street,just off Piccadilly. He left there in early 1944 (Robert Cecil moved in) to findtemporary refuge at a small inn in Aston Clinton, Buckinghamshire. In early1945, the Beast crept into his final lair, the bucolic Netherwood boarding housenear Hastings.At Netherwood, on 1 December 1947, the 72-year-old Master Therion shed hismortal coil. Mystery and controversy clouded even his death. Pat Dohertyasserted that a peal of thunder marked his dying moment, and Frieda Harris laterrecalled his last words as the oft-quoted “I am perplexed.”2 Harris, however,left Netherwood the day before his passing. Crowley’s attending nurse rememberedthe Beast’s final utterance as, “Sometimes I hate myself.”3 Another legend holdsthat Crowley cursed his doctor and brought about the physician’s death within aday of his own.4 In fact, Dr. William Brown Thomson had long suspected that hispatient was getting extra, illegal doses of heroin and had threatened to cut himoff, much to Crowley’s annoyance. Curse or not, Dr. Thomson soon followed histroublesome patient to the grave.Four days after the Beast’s passing, in nearby Brighton, a handful of friendsand devotees gathered to pay last respects. Louis Wilkinson read Crowley’s “Hymnto Pan,” provoking a final spasm of outrage among local bluenoses, who wereaghast that a “black mass” had taken place in their midst.Rumors of espionage and related dark doings clung to Crowley’s name in his lastyears and after his death. His name surfaced, indirectly, in connection with twomysterious wartime murders, the so-called Wych-Elm and Charles Walton (LowerQuinton) cases. The fragile threads connecting Crowley to them deserve briefconsideration.The first case arose from a grisly find near Hagley, west of Birmingham, in1943. Teenage poachers discovered of the skeleton of a young woman, subsequentlydubbed “Luebella” or “Bella,” in the hollow trunk of an ancient wych-elm(actually a wych-hazel) tree. Forensic examination indicated that the thirtyishvictim had been murdered, probably sometime in 1941. In the opinion of professedwitchcraft expert Professor Margaret Murray, the unusual disposal of the bodyand its severed hand marked a “black-magic” slaying.The crime naturally generated much rumor and speculation. In the yearsfollowing, it is alleged, files and evidence from the case, including “Bella’s”skeleton, went missing. Recently, one anonymous official who looked into thecase offered that “there were clear occult and secret service links,” thoughjust how (s)he arrived at that conclusion is unknown.5 Donald McCormick came tomuch the same conclusion in his 1968 Murder by Witchcraft, which explored theHagley Wood and Walton killings.In 1953, Wilfred Byford-Jones, a writer for the Wolverhampton Express & Star,found a source who claimed knowledge of the Wych-Elm Murder. According to thesource, a woman called “Anna,” Bella was killed because of her connection to aGerman spy ring that had operated in the Midlands and included a “traitorousBritish officer.”6 McCormick concluded that “Bella” most likely was a Dutchwoman whose interests included astrology. She might even have been a witch. Healso speculated that a mysterious Hungarian astrologer may have been connectedto the case. Other rumors linked the unfortunate woman and the espionage ring toa group of occultists that included associates of Crowley’s Cornwall coven.7Here we may have another vague glimpse of the weird nexus of Crowley,witchcraft, spies, Black Masses, and blackmail alluded to in Kim Philby’swartime report and other sources.The Crowley connection is a wee bit stronger in the second case, the WaltonMurder of February 1945. The victim, Charles Walton, was a seventy-four-year-oldlaborer from Lower Quinton, about forty miles from “Bella’s” wych-elm. Waltonwas found pinned to the ground with a hay-fork and slashed to death, his bloodsoaking the ground. Some took this as evidence of a ritual slaying.8 Theredoubtable Inspector Robert Fabian of Scotland Yard was called in toinvestigate. His suspicions settled on a man who owed Walton money, but theevidence would not support a charge. The case remained in limbo until 1955 when,once again, an informant came forward to the local press. “Mrs. Jones” claimedto have been initiated into a “witch cult” during WWII. It extended nationwideand was run by “Dr. Gardner,” an apparent reference to the father of modernWicca, Gerald Gardner.9 Gardner did meet Crowley, but by all accounts not until1946-1947. Another possibility is that this in some way related to DionFortune’s Society of the Inner Light which is alleged to have played a key partin the “Magical Battle of Britain.”Mrs. Jones’ most sensational accusation was that the killing itself was the workof “Aleister Crowley’s widow,” Pat Doherty, whom Gardner or whoever called infor just that purpose. This charge prompted a doubtful but intrigued localinspector to inquire of his colleagues in Cornwall. The result was theaforementioned police report, which described the membership and activities ofCrowley’s devotees around Tregerthen. It is hard to picture the gentle,Earth-motherly Pat as a ritual murderess, but appearances can be deceiving.One can easily dismiss the supposed Crowley connections to these murders assensationalist fantasies of the British press, which had lost none of itsenthusiasm for laying evils at the feet of the Worst Man in the World. One canalso, however, wonder whether Mrs. Jones’ story was a distortion of actualevents in a wartime campaign of disinformation and counter-espionage that hadused occult groups as cover.Suspicion and intrigue also clung to many of the Beast’s associates. Perhaps themost affected was Karl Germer, last encountered having lunch with Crowley andViereck in London in 1936. When the British Government again refused to granthim residency, he moved to Dublin. In 1937, Germer quit Dublin, reportedly atthe insistence of the German Embassy. How he antagonized the Germans is amystery, but his past, including his association with Crowley, may haveconvinced them that he was a British operative. Also recall Philby’s report thatthe German Legation in Dublin was the launchpad for occult and drug-linked plotsagainst England.Germer’s next stop was Belgium, where he resumed his trade as a machinerysalesman for British firms. Belgium, of course, played host to the murkyintrigues of Anthroposophist Walter Stein, among others. Belgium also put Germerrelatively close to Greta Sequeira and her secret missions in Germany.Curiously, Pat Doherty also was in the Reich just before the war broke out,escaping just in the nick of time alongside a mysterious “Jewish doctor.” Germerremained in Belgium until May 1940 when, with the German Blitzkrieg thunderingalong, the Belgians kicked him to France. Staying one step ahead of the Nazis,Germer took refuge in the unoccupied Vichy zone, where he cooled his heels fornearly a year. With the help of his American-based wife, and maybe others, hefinally made his way top the Caribbean and wangled a special U.S. immigrationpermit in spring 1941.In New York, Germer became the Mage’s general factotum in the States. Probablyfor that reason, he soon attracted the hostile scrutiny of the man who hadinvestigated Crowley back in 1919, J. Edgar Hoover. In December 1941, Hooverpressed the New York Bureau to give “preferred and expeditious attention” toGermer.10 When FBI agents in Gotham responded that they could not dig upanything negative, J. Edgar simply told them to try harder. Eventually, theyfound some personal enemy willing to brand Germer a pro-Nazi. It was a baselesscharge, but enough to put him and his new wife Sascha under surveillance andjustify a search of their apartment. Germer knew that he was being spied upon,and the harried couple resorted to communicating via written notes. Eventually,Germer came to believe that almost everyone was out to get him, and that the FBIwas but another manifestation of the nefarious Black Brotherhood. He alsobelieved that Hoover’s animus was not against him personally, but part of alarger conspiracy against Crowley. Paranoid or not, in that conclusion Germerwas absolutely right.To understand why, we need to pick up what Ian Fleming and Admiral Godfrey wereup to in the wake of the Hess case. In late May 1941, the pair departed on aspecial mission to the States, which may have been someone’s (Max Knight’s?) wayof getting them out of England and far away from Hess. Their mission was tooffer help to the still officially neutral Americans with counterintelligenceoperations against Axis agents. In discussions with the chief of Britishintelligence in America, the Canadian Sir William Stephenson, Fleming and theAdmiral learned that the biggest obstacle to their plans was the imperious andterritorial Mr. Hoover.11 Hoover may have been an efficient enough policeman,but as far as the British were concerned, he was no spy-hunter.Fleming found himself working with William “Wild Bill” Donovan, whom PresidentRoosevelt had named Coordinator of Intelligence (COI). Out of that came theOffice of Strategic Services (OSS) and out of that the CIA.12 Officially,domestic counterintelligence remained Hoover’s bailiwick, while Donovan’s newoutfit took responsibility overseas. As usual, the division was never clean orsatisfactory to either party. The FBI Director regarded Donovan’s operation as agang of “Ivy League dilettantes” meddling in his territory, some of themoutright security risks.13 Hoover mistrusted the English on principle, and thecoziness of Britons such as Fleming with the COI excited his suspicion andhostility all the more.Hoover also took a dim view of anything unconventional, which naturally includedoccult groups, though he was a Freemason. He certainly sniffed out Fleming’sconnection to Crowley. Perhaps J. Edgar worried that the English Magician knew alittle too much about the Bureau, and maybe about the Director himself. If, asis today commonly asserted (without being definitively proved), Hoover was acloseted homosexual, someone with Crowley’s inclinations and means of ferretingout secrets would have made him nervous.Hoover’s personal attention may have something to do with the dearth of Crowleyrecords in the FBI files.14 There is nothing in the extant Crowley file datedpast 1926, and nothing of any substance after August 1924, soon after Hoovertook over the Bureau.15 Those documents do make numerous mentions of the Beast’sconnection to George Sylvester Viereck, a fact Hoover used to justify blockingCrowley’s admission to the U.S.16 It was a handy, politically correct objectionunder the circumstances. The FBI had Viereck dead to rights as a Nazipropagandist and arrested him in 1942.Imagine then Hoover’s reaction when he discovered that Karl Germer, anotherGerman, and one of Crowley’s principal disciples, had arrived in the U.S. amonth or so after Fleming. Hoover must have suspected a connection that led himto set his agents on poor Germer. In their perusal of Germer’s papers, Hoover’sagents discovered his recent correspondence with the Mage, which furtherrevealed that dutiful Karl was raising money to bring Crowley to the States.Hoover must have smelled a British scheme to bring the old, disreputable, andpossibly dangerous agent back to America for some devious purpose. He may nothave been imagining things. Unable to employ Crowley’s unique talents inEngland, Fleming and his boss could have hoped to put him at Stephenson’sdisposal. Another veteran British spy then assisting Stephenson was none otherthan Sir William Wiseman.Persons in England were interested in helping Crowley reach the States. RobertCecil alludes to a scheme to get Crowley to the British West Indies for reasonsof health, but he failed to secure the necessary exit permit and passport.17Crowley’s real intention was to join Germer and other members of the OTO inCalifornia. By 1943, Cecil had sufficient clout as a secretary to SIS chief SirStewart Menzies, that he could get access to the Beast’s MI5 dossier, or one ofthem at least.18 Oddly, he mentions no attempt to see SIS’ file on the Magician.In the MI5 papers, Cecil claimed to find ample evidence of Crowley’s pro-Germanwriting during WWI but nothing to support his claims to have done that onBritish authority, nor does Cecil mention anything of a more recent nature. DidCecil see only what someone wanted him to see? However “black” Crowley’s recordseemed, Cecil admitted that “the case remains open.”19Cecil also concluded that the above must have been why the necessary Britishofficials were unwilling to assist Crowley’s departure. “He has done nothing forus,” they supposedly opined, “[and] we will do nothing for him.”20 Perhaps thiswas the result of years of disgust and mistrust, and then there was his statusas an undischarged bankrupt. But there may have been other good reasons to keepthe unpredictable Mr. Crowley on a very short leash. Maybe Max Knight wanted tokeep him close to home.Shortly after the war, there was a final effort to get Crowley to the U.S., ledby a young U.S. Army officer, Grady Louis McMurtry.21 He met the Beast afterarriving in Britain in fall 1943. It was no chance encounter. McMurtry was arecent initiate of the Agape Lodge, a thriving branch of the OTO based inPasadena, California. Leaves from front-line duty allowed Lieutenant McMurtry todeepen his connection with the declining Mage and receive further initiations.In 1946, McMurtry began a “Clear Crowley’s Name Campaign” which was to smooth ToMega Therion’s way back to America. The old man’s decline and Hoover’scontinuing obstructiveness, however, frustrated the plan.Writers such as Peter Levenda suggest that McMurtry was linked to Americanmilitary intelligence, and that his cultivation of Crowley somehow servedinterests in that sphere.22 While no evidence supports such a link during WWII,when the Korean conflict erupted a few years later, McMurtry did volunteer hisservices to U.S. Army intelligence (G-2), an unusual offer from a man whoseprior experience had been in ordnance.23Had Crowley made it to America, the intention of McMurtry and friends was, asnoted, to settle him in California. This brings us back to the Agape Lodge,which had been formed in the early 1930s by Crowley’s acolyte, Wilfred T. Smith.By the early 1940s, the dominant figure in the Lodge was the man who hadinitiated McMurtry, a Cal Tech rocket scientist, explosives expert, and studentof the occult, John Whiteside “Jack” Parsons. To no surprise, suspicions ofespionage attached to Parsons as well.24Parsons’s pioneering work in jet propulsion and rocketry led to his involvementin top-secret government projects. That lay awkwardly against his other role asleader of what FBI reports dubbed the “Church of Thelma” [sic].25 The samereports pointed out that Parsons and the group “received . . . orders from SirAllister [sic] Crowley in London.” A bigger concern was that Parsons had flirtedwith Communism and had numerous friends and acquaintances known or suspected tobe Reds.26 The FBI began investigating Parsons in 1943 and continued until hisbizarre death nine years later. In the end, Hoover’s men found no substantiveevidence of espionage, but the investigation raised enough flags to cost Parsonshis security clearance.What really got him into hot water was his removal in 1950 of classifieddocuments from his employer, Hughes Aircraft. Parsons admitted his deed, butexplained that he only wanted to copy the documents to include in an applicationfor a new job with the American Technicon Society, an affiliate of the IsraelInstitute of Technology.27 The IIT in turn had links to Israeli intelligence,the Mossad.Several things about Parsons remind one of Robin Thynne, most notably his appealto women and his association with secret government projects. Another similarityis his mystery-shrouded death. In 1952, Parsons was blown to bits in whatinvestigators deemed an accidental explosion. He kept a variety of explosivematerials in his private lab, including extremely unstable fulminate of mercury.Skeptics, however, doubted that Parsons (who was after all a rocket scientist)would have been so careless as to be hoist by his own petard; some hinted atsupernatural causes, and others at murderous conspiracies.Another intrigue that wound through Parson’ last years was his unfortunaterelationship with a man he identified to Crowley as “Frater H.” This was aformer U.S. Navy officer, L. Ron Hubbard, the future founder of Scientology.Hubbard did have a brief affiliation with the ONI early in WWII, but his servicerecord indicates nothing of the kind during the time of his acquaintance withParsons. Soon after the war, Hubbard and Parsons ventured into the Mojave Desertto perform the Babalon Working, a ritual aimed at achieving the Beast’s longtimegoal of spawning a Thelemic messiah. Hubbard eventually ended up running offwith Parsons’ money and girlfriend. Years later, Hubbard explained his dealingswith Parsons as part of his secret work for Naval Intelligence, or the FBI, orthe local police (the story varies) to infiltrate a dangerous black magic cult,the OTO, which was being used by someone to enlist or compromise scientists.28It all sounds vaguely like an American version of Philby’s tale.Just before Crowley’s death, Karl Germer made a last-ditch effort to visit theBeast. His effort to obtain a visa, however, met with an insurmountable stonewall.29 Germer assumed authority over the OTO, but the matter of succession wasclouded, however, by the machinations of Gerald Yorke. That once and likelycontinuing intelligence operative stage managed the settlement of Crowley’sestate, copying and, perhaps, destroying papers, and withholding a vital charterfrom Germer. Yorke’s may have been the guiding hand behind the excisions made tothe Beast’s Confessions. He likewise may have influenced the dismissive attitudeevident in John Symonds’ 1951 biography. Did Yorke have an assignment to spinCrowley’s legacy in such a way as to discredit or obliterate all evidence of hisintelligence activities?Under Germer’s leadership, or lack of it, the Order withered away to almostnothing. The Agape Lodge folded the year after Parsons’ death, and by the timeGermer passed away in 1962, the remaining Thelemites were so scattered that ittook years for some of them to learn that their master was gone. The situationwas compounded by Germer’s deepening paranoia, which led him to isolate himselfand his wife in the tiny Sierra town of West Point, California. Among the itemsGermer acquired from Crowley’s estate were an archive of OTO materials, a troveof the Beast’s correspondence, and various personal and ritual items. Germerjealously guarded these in his mountain hideaway.Starting around 1965, alumni of the Agape Lodge and others connected to Crowleywere victims of mysterious break-ins aimed at the theft of OTO-relatedmaterials. Israel Regardie was one. In a terrible realization of her paranoidfantasies, two years later, Sascha Germer was the victim of a brazen assault onher home and person. Her attackers tricked their way into her isolated house,maced and bound her, and stole items from the Crowley collection.Much suspicion subsequently alighted upon the so-called Solar Lodge. Surfacingin Los Angeles in the late 1960s, it was dominated by Georgina “Jean” Brayton,who apparently aspired to take up where the old Agape Lodge had left off.Besides drugs, it emphasized an apocalyptic and allegedly racist doctrine thathad little in common with Crowley’s ideas. Though nothing was ever proved in thethefts, the Solar Lodge soon landed in other trouble with the law. This includedcharges of child abuse and, most notoriously, alleged association with CharlesManson and his homicidal, LSDADDLED Family.30 Such connections, probablycoincidental, fed broader speculation that the Solar Lodge, the Mansonites, andgroups such as the weird Process Church of the Final Judgment were all parts ofa nefarious mind-control experiment run by the CIA or other spooks. If there isany truth behind such theories, perhaps it is more strange fruit of Crowley’slong-ago experimentation with mescaline and psychic manipulation.Germer died without designating a successor, resulting in more schism andsecession. Autonomous branches of the OTO soon arose in England and Switzerland.In the Western Hemisphere, Grady McMurtry struggled with the Brazil-basedMarcelo Ramos Motta for succession. McMurtry surfaced in 1969 to salvage theremnants of Agape and what remained of Germer’s archive. Years of litigationended with victory in the States for McMurtry, who assumed the title CaliphHymenaeus Alpha, a name originally given him by Crowley. The unbowed Mottaascribed his defeat to a plot by British and American intelligence “to absorbthe OTO into the ideological warfare network of the political right.”31 Abettingthis conspiracy, alleged Motta, was “veteran British intelligence agent” GeraldYorke. Naturally, Motta also alleged that McMurtry was another intelligenceasset.32 Motta’s detractors dismissed him as an alcoholic with delusions ofgrandeur and a persecution complex.My final nagging doubt is not whether I have overstated Crowley’s involvementwith intelligence, but whether I have overlooked or misread some critical detailthat would make better sense of his activities or cast them in a differentlight. For instance, how much, if any, reality is there behind Hubbard’s allegedconspiracy, Philby’s 1940s story of drugs, blackmail, and black magic, Makgill’s1920s “Cult of Evil,” or the high weirdness Frances Gregg sensed around Crowleyduring WWI? Was some of this just misinterpretation of Crowley’s involvement inintelligence affairs, or are some glimpses of deeper, more sinister secrets ofthe Beast?As noted at the beginning, the available evidence relevant to Crowley’sinvolvement with espionage and attendant activity ultimately raises morequestions than it answers. I am forced to conclude that the lack of recordsabout the Mage’s role as an agent is intentional. On the British side, adeliberate purge of Crowley materials has decimated the open files. On top ofthat, misdirection, obfuscation, and stonewalling by MI5, SIS, Scotland Yard,and other agencies reflects a continuing effort to obscure or deny Crowley’srole as a British intelligence asset. Much the same may be said of the FBI’simplausible denials. Why?Certainly one factor is the reflexive secrecy of such agencies. The withholdingof seemingly innocuous information can be justified simply because someone atsome point deemed it a secret. The security of the British Empire can no longerbe at stake, but some reputations, personal or institutional, might be. Thesurmised destruction of Crowley’s MI5 files took place in the early 1950s, partof a mass culling of “records no longer worth keeping,” which doubtless includedmany items deemed politically embarrassing. A smattering of these records,thought historically significant by the chief “weeder,” Gilbert Wakefield,survive and include references to Walter Stein, the Nazis, and even theLusitania.33 Of the Beast, however, not a hair remains.Subsequent releases by MI5 show that dossiers on persons of much less historicalsignificance than Crowley were preserved, which makes the 1950s criteria fordestruction hard to infer. Coincidentally or not, the purge began duringChurchill’s return as prime minister from 1951-1955. Did Churchill take apersonal interest in seeing the Beast’s records destroyed? As Robert Cecilsuggests, Crowley’s record may have been too “black” to ever see light of day.The past hides many secrets, many crimes, many uncredited heroes, and manyunsuspected villains. Aleister Crowley knew more than his share of each.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 Sutin, 391.2 Symonds, Great Beast, 296.3 Symonds, King of the Shadow Realm, 578.4 Warren Hill, “The Beast’s Last Curse,” American Weekly (11 April 1948) andDaily Express (4 Dec. 1947).5 Newman, 129.6 “Bella in the Wych-Elm- A Midlands Murder Mystery,”www.mysteriouspeople.com/Bella_in_the_wychelm.htm[http://www.mysteriouspeople.com/Bella_in_the_wychelm.htm], and Newman, 129.7 Newman, 129-130.8 The purported significance did not rest in the fact that Walton’s death tookplace on or about February 14th, modern Valentine’s Day, but the correspondenceof this day with the pagan festival of Candlemas or Imbolc under the old Juliancalendar.9 Newman, 130.
