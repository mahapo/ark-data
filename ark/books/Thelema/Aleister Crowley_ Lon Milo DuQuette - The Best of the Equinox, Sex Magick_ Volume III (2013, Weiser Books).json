The mysteriouscaller was Herr Theodor Reuss, agent of the Prussian Secret Service, Wagnerianopera singer,1 [part0003_split_002.html#intro-aft1] newspaper correspondent,high degree Freemason, and head of Ordo Templi Orientis, a German magicalsociety with Rosicrucian and Masonic pretentions. Two years earlier Reuss hadpresented Crowley with honorary membership in the O.T.O., presumably in hopes itwould bolster Crowley's esoteric credentials in a lawsuit that had been filedagainst him by S. L. MacGregor Mathers, the head of the London-based HermeticOrder of the Golden Dawn.Mathers had sued to prevent Crowley from publishing proprietary initiationrituals and teachings of the G.D. in his publication, The Equinox. In the suit,Mathers was claiming to be the worldwide head of the “Rosicrucians,” an act ofspiritual presumption which outraged Reuss and the leaders of a score of otherexisting European Hermetic and Rosicrucian societies. In an attempt to diluteMathers' credentials in the eyes of the court these organizations lavished ahost of honorary degrees and titles upon Crowley—so many that he completely losttrack of his various memberships, degrees and mystic titles. Crowley eventuallywon the suit and published The Equinox.The purpose of the June, 1912 visit from Reuss, however, was not to discuss thelawsuit or Golden Dawn matters, but to take Crowley to task for publishing theO.T.O.'s supreme secret of sexual magick. Crowley protested that he had done nosuch thing, and that in fact, he didn't even know the secret and was completelyunaware that the O.T.O. had anything to do with sex magick.Reuss stepped to Crowley's own bookshelf and plucked out a copy of LiberCCCXXXIII: The Book of Lies2 [part0003_split_002.html#intro-aft2] and opened itto chapter 36, The Star Sapphire, a short version of the Hexagram Ritual.Crowley did not immediately understand exactly how the contents of this tinychapter could possibly reveal the supreme secret of sexual magick, so Ruesspatiently discussed what he had written vis a vis certain theoretical andaspects of magick. He led the discussion in such a way that Crowley experiencedan almost instant epiphany. He was stunned. Since childhood he had intuited theimportance and the potential power of sex. But here, in the most profound andsimple terms, was the key – not only to the mythological symbolism of theancients, of Christianity and Freemasonry, but (theoretically at least) the keyto the mysteries of human consciousness and creation itself.Before the afternoon had passed, Ruess had conferred upon Crowley (and hislover, Leila Waddell) the highest initiatory degree of the O.T.O., the IX°, andobligated them to the discretionary terms of its communication. This ‘oath ofsecrecy’ is a somewhat paradoxical obligation. Rather than being an oath not toreveal the secret to the world, it is rather more a promise to perpetuate thesecret, to assure that it is protected, preserved, and never profaned, diluted,corrupted or lost.One doesn't learn a true magical secret like one learns a juicy piece of gossip.A true magical secret is a light bulb that goes off over your own head when youfinally “get” something. In other words, the IX° initiate of the O.T.O. is notobligated to conceal the “secret” but on the contrary, obligated to make sure asmany worthy individuals as possible discover the secret by discerning itthemselves.Crowley took this obligation very seriously, and his writings on this particularsubject (as we will see in this Best of the Equinox volume on Sex Magick) can bevery difficult to understand. They are full of strange, sometimes disturbing andconfusing symbolic language that Crowley believed clearly revealed everythingthere was to reveal to anyone ready to have everything revealed to them.I must confess, this is not easy. But it is a magical labor well worth theeffort, because the reward is nothing less than the Holy Grail itself.After bestowing the IX° on Crowley and Leila, Ruess also authorized Crowley tocreate and head a British chapter of O.T.O. and directed him to expand anddevelop the organization's rituals of initiation into workable and viablemagical ceremonies. From that moment until the end of his life in 1947 sexmagick would be the focus of Aleister Crowley's magical work.Unfortunately, the term, sex magick, has a somewhat lurid ring to it. It bringsto mind visions of costumed orgies and pornographic acts of dramatic depravity.Crowley's outrageous and eccentric lifestyle and reputation did little toassuage public perceptions about the naughtiness of anything he might beinvolved in. It's true, he enjoyed shocking anyone who was easy to shock. To thedisappointment of many would-be magicians, however, sex magick is a demandingphysical and meditative yogic discipline of the highest order. The underlyingtheory of the technique is as challenging to the imagination as the postulatesof quantum mechanics. Yet the fundamental key to sex magick is breathtakinglysimple, and can be summarized in the single word “ecstasy” – the divineconsciousness we all experience whenever we temporarily obliterate our sense ofseparateness from Godhead in timeless moments of orgasm. In that eternal instantthe self becomes the All – and when we are the All . . . there is nothing wecannot create.Modern students of Crowley are further challenged by the terminology he wasobliged to use in order to camouflage a direct discussion of the subject. Suchobfuscation was necessary not only because of Crowley's O.T.O. obligations, butalso because of serious concerns of legality. We must recall that it wasn't sovery long ago that one could not legally publish material concerning sexualmatters. Even medical journals needed to be very careful about how the subjectwas approached in print. Ironically, discussions of human/blood sacrifice werenot taboo subjects to write about. Crowley was fiendishly delighted to play thisgame of words with the publishing world and the public. Not to be dissuaded, hesimply drew upon his mastery of language and his knowledge of the colorfulmetaphors of magick to be as shockingly explicit as he wanted. He (sometimesunwisely) assumed any moderately intelligent person would know what he wasreally saying.Orgasm and ecstasy he could refer to as death and sacrifice; sexual fluids(sacred elements used as Eucharistic talismans in India and the East formillennia) became blood or water or the elixir; the penis became the lance, orthe wand, or the rood, or the cross; the vagina the cup, or the grail, or therose, etc.In Magick in Theory and Practice Crowley confesses exactly what kind of game heis playing. In Chapter 12, Of the Bloody Sacrifice, and of Matters Cognate, hewrites,You are also likely to get into trouble over this chapter unless you trulycomprehend its meaning.*He also begins a footnote to the above statement by warning the reader,*There is a traditional saying that whenever an Adept seems to have made astraightforward, comprehensible statement, then is it most certain that He meanssomething entirely different. The Truth is nevertheless clearly set forth in HisWords; it is His simplicity that baffles the unworthy. I have chosen theexpressions in this Chapter in such a way that it is likely to mislead thoseMagicians who allow selfish interests to cloud their intelligence, but to giveuseful hints to such as are bound by the proper oaths to devote their powers tolegitimate ends. . .3 [part0003_split_002.html#intro-aft3]"},{"pageContent":"LIBER XV, THE MASS OF THE GNOSTIC CATHOLIC CHURCHPerhaps Crowley's greatest and most approachable published work of sex magick isLiber XV, the Mass of the Gnostic Catholic Church4[part0003_split_002.html#intro-aft4] (known commonly as the Gnostic Mass). It isthe central ceremony (both public and private) of the O.T.O. and is theritualized celebration of the Order's supreme secret of magick. That secretemanates from the Sovereign Sanctuary of the Gnosis – the Ninth Degree. It isfor all intent and purposes the magical technique that Theodore Ruess initiallyaccused Crowley of revealing.Sacred and secret as this technique is, Crowley ingeniously crafted his GnosticMass to openly communicate and execute the operation in the form of a publicceremony, a shared Eucharist of wine and bread – a dramatic art form that can bewitnessed and appreciated by anyone, magician and non-magician alike.) In beautyis eternal truth revealed, and the Gnostic Mass is arguably Crowley's mostbeautiful ritual ceremony.The Gnostic Mass is very similar in form to the Mass of the Roman Catholic andEastern Orthodox churches. In fact, Crowley was inspired to create the Massafter attending services at St. Basil's Cathedral5[part0003_split_002.html#intro-aft5] in Moscow. As you will see, the mostobvious difference between the Crowley's Mass and Christian Masses is thepresence of both a Priest and a Priestess. One would correctly assume that theparticular sex magick technique the Gnostic Mass deals with is one that isaccomplished by one man and one woman. Variations on the theme of this centralsecret, however, make it also privately amendable for solitary, homosexual andnon-sexual workings (Crowley's diaries are full of such experiments). Liber XV,the Gnostic Mass (as written and as officially and publicly celebrated),however, does not reflect or specifically accommodate these other variations inits officers, order of ceremony or formulae.Anyone who is even slightly familiar with Aleister Crowley and his work knowsthat he was not homophobic. His Gnostic Mass is not a biological, cultural,political or magical statement on the virtues of heterosexual relationships. Itis clear to me, however, that Crowley felt that the fundamental essence of thisparticular magical technique could be best first understood, appreciated, andmastered in terms of male/female-lingam/yoni/sperm/egg gender polarities, beforeexperimental variations in the formula are introduced and elaborated upon.That being said, the formulae of this kind of operation are based on thefollowing postulates: 1. For human beings on the physical plane, the supreme creative act is the creation of another living human being. 2. Neither the male nor the female of our species is possessed of a full set of human equipment necessary to accomplish this wonder. 3. What is absent in one sex is present in the other. 4. The magical laws that govern the procreative processes which ultimately result in the birth of a physical child are the same magical laws that govern creative processes taking place on more subtle planes.In other words, our physical bodies, male and female, are alchemicallaboratories (operating independent of our conscious direction) that routinelytransform light and energy from the Sun (from the nutrients we eat) into ourtangible flesh, blood, nerves, and brain tissue (and our more intangible aspectssuch as electrical nerve impulses, magnetic, fields, radiation, light, thoughtwaves, etc.). On the material plan when the male and female elements are joinedand combined they are capable of passing our coded essence to a new generation –literally, we can (and regularly do) create the living vessel for theincarnating soul of another human being. Used with skill and full magical intentthe sex magician employs these already-functioning magical ‘laboratories’ offlesh and blood, nerve, thought, imagination and will to create the ‘incarnatingsoul’ of whatever object, concept, or level of consciousness her or she mightintend to manifest in his or her life.The focus of this kind of sex magick, is not the physical tools of the operation– it is not the penis or the vagina or the sperm or the egg; it is not the maleor the female, father or mother, but in the “child” of their ecstasy – thegolden moment of disintegrating ecstatic union when all consciousness ofseparate existence is dissolved for an eternal instant into the creative blissof supreme consciousness. In the Gnostic Mass the mother is the Priestess, thefather is the Priest and (at the climactic moment) the Child becomes present inthe bread and wine that has been charged by the infinite, wall-to-wall radiationthat is the result of the ecstatic union of the Priest and Priestess. The hostand wine for a golden moment become as it were a living petri dish, aninfinitely fertile medium capable of accepting the image (and facilitating theconception) of any thought form a concentrated mind can stamp upon it. Eachcommunicant (each member of the congregation) then has the opportunity toceremonially consume that child (in the host and wine) and in essence becomepregnant with the fertilized object of their own particular heart's desire.Crowley created Liber XV as a ritual suitable for public celebration, andindeed, because of the international growth of the O.T.O. since Crowley's deathit is regularly performed worldwide. It is not obscene or pornographic. Indeed,if it were a movie it would most likely be rated PG (or PG-13 if the Priestesschooses not to resume her robe once the veil is opened). Still, it doesn't takea genius to see the sexual references throughout. Crowley also fantasized a moreovertly sexual group ceremony and wrote an account of it in Liber DCCCXI,Energized Enthusiasm which was first published in The Equinox I, 9. As far as Iknow the events he describes in this essay are entirely fictional, and representanother attempt for Crowley to be very clear and frank about aspects of sexmagick without directly violating his O.T.O. obligations of secrecy. I think youwill agree with me that it appears Crowley very much enjoyed playing thisliterary game of sexual hide and seek.We've included in this volume a collection of other works that issued fromCrowley's pen, but if they were written as literary games they are of aprofoundly different order. Indeed, three of them Crowley classified as Class A,“. . .books of which many be changed not so much as a style of a letter: thatis, they represent the utterance of an Adept entirely beyond the criticism ofeven the Visible Head of the Organization.”6[part0003_split_002.html#intro-aft6]There are thirteen such Class A Libers7 [part0003_split_002.html#intro-aft7] inall, including Liber AL vel Legis, The Book of the Law. The three presented herewere first published in The Equinox I, 6 & 7. They are:1. Liber A'Ash Vel Capricorni Pneumatici Sub Figura CCCLXX * Contains the true secret of all practical magick.8 [part0003_split_002.html#intro-aft8] * The Book of the Creation or of the Goat of the Spirit * [A]nalizes the nature of the creative magical force in man, explains how to awaken it, how to use it and indicates the general as well as the particular objects to be gained thereby.9 [part0003_split_002.html#intro-aft9] * The Interpretation of this Book will be given to members of the Grade of Dominus Liminis on application, each to his Adeptus.10 [part0003_split_002.html#intro-aft10] * CCCLXX cu Creation.2. Liber Cheth Vel Vallum Abiegni Sub Figura CLVI * This book is a perfect account of the task of Exempt Adept, considered under the symbols of a particular plane, not the intellectual.11 [part0003_split_002.html#intro-aft11] * The Wall of Abiegnus (the Sacred Mountain of the Rosicrucians) gives the formula of Attainment by devotion to our Lady Babalon. It instructs the aspirant how to dissolve his personality in the Universal Life.12 [part0003_split_002.html#intro-aft12] * CLVI—Babalon, to whom the book refers. See Sepher Sephiroth.13 [part0003_split_002.html#intro-aft13]3. Liber Stellae Rubeae * A secret ritual, the Heart of IAO-OAI, delivered unto V.V.V.V.V. for his use in a certain matter of Liber Legis, and written down under the figure LCVI. * This book is sufficiently described by the title.14 [part0003_split_002.html#intro-aft14] * The Book of the Ruby Star * [D]escribes an extremely powerful ritual of practical Magick; how to arouse the Magical Force wihin the operator and how to use it to create whatever may be required.15 [part0003_split_002.html#intro-aft15] * LXVI—The sum of the first 11 numbers. This book relates to Magic, whose Key is 11.16 [part0003_split_002.html#intro-aft16]While not a Class A paper, Astarte vel Liber Berylli sub figura CLXXV, whichfirst appeared in The Equinox I, 7, is no less a powerful magical document. Itis instruction on how the magician unites himself or herself to a particularDeity by means of devotion.We have also included in this volume, two rituals, also from The Equinox I, 7,Liber Had, and Liber Nu, which in themselves are not at first glance seen to berituals of sex magick; but instead are solitary meditations on the twoinfinities (or primary ‘gods’) of the Thelemic pantheon; Had (or Hadit), theinfinitely contracted center of the cosmos, and Nu (or Nuit) the infinitelyexpanded circumference of the cosmos.Because infinite space has no limits, and Nuit is everywhere; therefore thecenter must also be everywhere. Both the infinitely large infinity and theinfinitely small infinity are in infinite contact. This is love making thegrandest of scales, But what has all this to do with sex magick? Perhaps easierto ask, “What does sex magick have to do with quantum mechanics? What doesspace, time, and motion have to do with consciousness?”For the moment let's just start by pointing out that the Priest in the GnosticMass is only the Priest in so much that he can magically embody the cosmicHadit, and the Priestess is only the Priestess in so much that she can magicallyembody cosmic Nuit. The union of Nuit and Hadit creates the Child, and the Childis the object of our sex magick operation.For the bold magician, I strongly advise not only reading and studying Liber Hadand Liber Nu, but practicing and perfecting both of them.Finally, I would again like to return to Liber XXXVI, The Star Sapphire,17[part0003_split_002.html#intro-aft17] that tiny work that brought Theodor Reussto Crowley's door in 1912 and changed his (and mine, and perhaps your) life in amost magical way. The Star Sapphire makes reference to “The Holy Hexagram” whichcan be viewed symbolically as the union of the male (upright) triangle and thefemale (downturned) triangle. I can't help but speculate that Reuss might havealso pointed to Chapter 69 of The Book of Lies18[part0003_split_002.html#intro-aft18] to further and more explicitly lead thediscussion to the sex magick technique he was trying to get Crowley to discoverfor himself. As that particular chapter and its commentary do not later appearanywhere in any of The Equinox series I have appended them below for yourmeditation, your edification, and perhaps—just perhaps—for your epiphany.Lon Milo DuQuetteCosta Mesa, California"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 69 from The Book of Lies69KEΦAAH ΞΘTHE WAY TO SUCCEED—AND THE WAY TO SUCK EGGS!This is the Holy Hexagram.Plunge from the height, O God, and interlock with Man!Plunge from the height, O Man, and interlock with Beast!The Red Triangle is the descending tongue of grace; the Blue Triangle is theascending tongue of prayer.This Interchange, the Double Gift of Tongues, the Word of DoublePower—ABRAHADABRA!—is the sign of the GREAT WORK, for the GREAT WORK isaccomplished in Silence.

In the ordinary Hexagram, the Hexagram of nature, the redtriangle is upwards, like fire, and the blue triangle downwards, like water. Inthe magical hexagram this is revered; the descending red triangle is that ofHorus, a sign specially revealed by him personally, at the Equinox of the Gods.(It is the flame descending upon the altar, and licking up the burnt offering.)The blue triangle represents the aspiration, since blue is the colour ofdevotion, and the triangle, kinetically considered, is the symbol of directedforce.In the first three paragraphs this formation of the hexagram is explained; it isa symbol of the mutual separation of the Holy Guardian Angel and his client. Inthe interlocking is indicated the completion of the work.Paragraph 4 explains in slightly different language what we have said above, andthe scriptural image of tongues is introduced.In paragraph 5 the symbolism of tongues is further developed. Abrahadabra is ourprimal example of an interlocked word. We assume that the reader has thoroughlystudied that word in Liber D., etc. The sigil of Cancer links up this symbolismwith the number of the chapter.The remaining paragraphs continue the Gallic symbolism.1 [part0003_split_000.html#intro-ft1] In 1882 he sang at Bayreuth at the premierof Wagner's Parsifal.2 [part0003_split_000.html#intro-ft2] Aleister Crowley.

This secretion is analogous tosemen, but not identical with it. There are but few men and fewer women, thosewomen being invariably androgyne, who possess it at any time in any quantity.So closely is this secretion connected with the sexual economy that it appearsto me at times as if it might be a by-product of that process which generatessemen. That some form of this doctrine has been generally accepted is shown inthe prohibitions of all religions. Sanctity has been assumed to depend onchastity, and chastity has nearly always been interpreted as abstinence. But Idoubt whether the relation is so simple as this would imply; for example, I findin myself that manifestations of mental creative force always concur with someabnormal condition of the physical powers of generation. But it is not the casethat long periods of chastity, on the one hand, or excess of orgies, on theother, are favourable to its manifestation or even to its formation.I know myself, and in me it is extremely strong; its results are astounding.For example, I wrote Tannhäuser, complete from conception to execution, insixty-seven consecutive hours. I was unconscious of the fall of nights and days,even after stopping; nor was there any reaction of fatigue. This work waswritten when I was twenty-four years old, immediately on the completion of anorgie which would normally have tired me out.Often and often have I noticed that sexual satisfaction so-called has left medissatisfied and unfatigued, and let loose the floods of verse which havedisgraced my career.Yet, on the contrary, a period of chastity has sometimes fortified me for agreat outburst. This is far from being invariably the case. At the conclusion ofthe K 2 expedition, after five months of chastity, I did no work whatever,barring very few odd lyrics, for months afterwards.I may mention the year 1911. At this time I was living, in excellent goodhealth, with the woman whom I loved. Her health was, however, variable, and wewere both constantly worried.The weather was continuously fine and hot. For a period of about three months Ihardly missed a morning; always on waking I burst out with a new idea which hadto be written down.The total energy of my being was very high. My weight was 10 stone 8 lb., whichhad been my fighting weight when I was ten years younger. We walked some twentymiles daily through hilly forest.The actual amount of MSS. written at this time is astounding; their variety iseven more so; of their excellence I will not speak.Here is a rough list from memory; it is far from exhaustive:Image [../images/00013.jpeg]I think this phenomenon is unique in the history of literature.I may further refer to my second journey to Algeria, where my sexual life,though fairly full, had been unsatisfactory.On quitting Biskra, I was so full of ideas that I had to get off the train atEl-Kantara, where I wrote “The Scorpion.” Five or six poems were written on theway to Paris; “The Ordeal of Ida Pendragon” during my twenty-four hours' stay inParis, and “Snowstorm” and “The Electric Silence” immediately on my return toEngland.To sum up, I can always trace a connection between my sexual condition and thecondition of artistic creation, which is so close as to approach identity, andyet so loose that I cannot predicate a single important proposition.It is these considerations which give me pain when I am reproached by theignorant with wishing to produce genius mechanically. I may fail, but my failureis a thousand times greater than their utmost success.I shall therefore base my remarks not so much on the observations which I havemyself made, and the experiments which I have tried, as on the acceptedclassical methods of producing that energized enthusiasm which is the lever thatmoves God."},{"pageContent":"IIIThe Greeks say that there are three methods of discharging the genial secretionof which I have spoken. They thought perhaps that their methods tended tosecrete it, but this I do not believe altogether, or without a qualm. For themanifestation of force implies force, and this force must have come fromsomewhere. Easier I find it to say “subconsciousness” and “secretion” than topostulate an external reservoir, to extend my connotation of “man” than toinvent “God.”However, parsimony apart, I find it in my experience that it is useless to floga tired horse. There are times when I am absolutely bereft of even one drop ofthis elixir. Nothing will restore it, neither rest in bed, nor drugs, norexercise. On the other hand, sometimes when after a severe spell of work I havebeen dropping with physical fatigue, perhaps sprawling on the floor, too tiredto move hand or foot, the occurrence of an idea has restored me to perfectintensity of energy, and the working out of the idea has actually got rid of theaforesaid physical fatigue, although it involved a great additional labour.Exactly parallel (nowhere meeting) is the case of mania. A madman may struggleagainst six trained athletes for hours, and show no sign of fatigue. Then hewill suddenly collapse, but at a second's notice from the irritable idea willresume the struggle as fresh as ever. Until we discovered “unconscious muscularaction” and its effects, it was rational to suppose such a man “possessed of adevil”; and the difference between the madman and the genius is not in thequantity but in the quality of their work. Genius is organized, madness chaotic.Often the organization of genius is on original lines, and ill-balanced andignorant medicine-men mistake it for disorder. Time has shown that Whistler andGauguin “kept rules” as well as the masters whom they were supposed to beupsetting."},{"pageContent":"IVThe Greeks say that there are three methods of discharging the Leyden Jar ofGenius. These three methods they assign to three Gods.These three Gods are Dionysus, Apollo, Aphrodite. In English: wine, woman andsong.Now it would be a great mistake to imagine that the Greeks were recommending avisit to a brothel. As well condemn the High Mass at St. Peter's on the strengthof having witnessed a Protestant revival meeting. Disorder is always a parody oforder, because there is no archetypal disorder that it might resemble. OwenSeaman can parody a poet; nobody can parody Owen Seaman. A critic is a bundle ofimpressions; there is no ego behind it. All photographs are essentially alike;the works of all good painters essentially differ.Some writers suppose that in the ancient rites of Eleusis the High Priestpublicly copulated with the High Priestess. Were this so, it would be no more“indecent” than it is “blasphemous” for the priest to make bread and wine intothe body and blood of God.True, the Protestants say that it is blasphemous; but a Protestant is one towhom all things sacred are profane, whose mind being all filth can see nothingin the sexual act but a crime or a jest, whose only facial gestures are thesneer and the leer.Protestantism is the excrement of human thought, and accordingly in Protestantcountries art, if it exist at all, only exists to revolt. Let us return fromthis unsavoury allusion to our consideration of the methods of the Greeks."},{"pageContent":"VAgree then that it does not follow from the fact that wine, woman and song makethe sailors tavern that these ingredients must necessarily concoct a hell-broth.There are some people so simple as to think that, when they have proved thereligious instinct to be a mere efflorescence of the sex-instinct, they havedestroyed religion.We should rather consider that the sailor's tavern gives him his only glimpse ofheaven, just as the destructive criticism of the phallicists has only proved sexto be a sacrament. Consciousness, says the materialist, axe in hand, is afunction of the brain. He has only re-formulated the old saying, “Your bodiesare the temples of the Holy Ghost.”!Now sex is justly hallowed in this sense, that it is the eternal fire of therace. Huxley admitted that “some of the lower animalculæ are in a senseimmortal,” because they go on reproducing eternally by fission, and howeveroften you divide x by 2 there is always something left. But he never seems tohave seen that mankind is immortal in exactly the same sense, and goes onreproducing itself with similar characteristics through the ages, changed bycircumstance indeed, but always identical in itself. But the spiritual flower ofthis process is that at the moment of discharge a physical ecstasy occurs, aspasm analogous to the mental spasm which meditation gives. And further, in thesacramental and ceremonial use of the sexual act, the divine consciousness maybe attained."},{"pageContent":"VIThe sexual act being then a sacrament, it remains to consider in what respectthis limits the employment of the organs.First, it is obviously legitimate to employ them for their natural physicalpurpose. But if it be allowable to use them ceremonially for a religiouspurpose, we shall find the act hedged about with many restrictions.For in this case the organs become holy. It matters little to mere propagationthat men should be vicious; the most debauched roué might and almost certainlywould beget more healthy children than a semi-sexed prude. So the so-called“moral” restraints are not based on reason; thus they are neglected.But admit its religious function, and one may at once lay down that the act mustnot be profaned. It must not be undertaken lightly and foolishly without excuse.It may be undertaken for the direct object of continuing the race.It may be undertaken in obedience to real passion; for passion, as its nameimplies, is rather inspired by a force of divine strength and beauty without thewill of the individual, often even against it.It is the casual or habitual—what Christ called “idle”—use or rather abuse ofthese forces which constitutes their profanation. It will further be obviousthat, if the act in itself is to be the sacrament in a religious ceremony, thisact must be accomplished solely for the love of God. All personal considerationsmust be banished utterly. Just as any priest can perform the miracle oftransubstantiation, so can any man, possessing the necessary qualifications,perform this other miracle, whose nature must form the subject of a subsequentdiscussion.Personal aims being destroyed, it is à fortiori necessary to neglect social andother similar considerations.Physical strength and beauty are necessary and desirable for æsthetic reasons,the attention of the worshippers being liable to distraction if the celebrantsare ugly, deformed, or incompetent. I need hardly emphasize the necessity forthe strictest self-control and concentration on their part. As it would beblasphemy to enjoy the gross taste of the wine of the sacrament, so must thecelebrant suppress even the minutest manifestation of animal pleasure.Of the qualifying tests there is no necessity to speak; it is sufficient to saythat the adepts have always known how to secure efficiency.Needless also to insist on a similar quality in the assistants; the sexualexcitement must be suppressed and transformed into its religious equivalent."},{"pageContent":"VIIWith these preliminaries settled in order to guard against foreseen criticismsof those Protestants who, God having made them a little lower than the Angels,have made themselves a great deal lower than the beasts by their consistentlybestial interpretation of all things human and divine, we may consider first thetriune nature of these ancient methods of energizing enthusiasm.Music has two parts; tone or pitch, and rhythm. The latter quality associates itwith the dance, and that part of dancing which is not rhythm is sex. Now thatpart of sex which is not a form of the dance, animal movement, is intoxicationof the soul, which connects it with wine. Further identities will suggestthemselves to the student.By the use of the three methods in one the whole being of man may thus bestimulated.The music will create a general harmony of the brain, leading it in its ownpaths; the wine affords a general stimulus of the animal nature; and thesex-excitement elevates the moral nature of the man by its close analogy withthe highest ecstasy. It remains, however, always for him to make the finaltransmutation. Unless he have the special secretion which I have postulated, theresult will be commonplace.So consonant is this system with the nature of man that it is exactly parodiedand profaned not only in the sailor's tavern, but in the Society ball. Here, forthe lowest natures the result is drunkenness, disease and death; for the middlenatures a gradual blunting of the finer feelings; for the higher, anexhilaration amounting at the best to the foundation of a life-long love.If these Society “rites” are properly performed, there should be no exhaustion.After a ball, one should feel the need of a long walk in the young morning air.The weariness or boredom, the headache or somnolence, are Nature's warnings."},{"pageContent":"VIIINow the purpose of such a ball, the moral attitude on entering, seems to me tobe of supreme importance. If you go with the idea of killing time, you arerather killing yourself. Baudelaire speaks of the first period of love when theboy kisses the trees of the wood, rather than kiss nothing. At the age ofthirty-six I found myself at Pompeii, passionately kissing that great gravestatue of a woman that stands in the avenue of the tombs. Even now, as I wake inthe morning, I sometimes fall to kissing my own arms.It is with such a feeling that one should go to a ball, and with such a feelingintensified, purified and exalted, that one should leave it.If this be so, how much more if one go with the direct religious purpose burningin one's whole being! Beethoven roaring at the sunrise is no strange spectacleto me, who shout with joy and wonder, when I understand (without which onecannot really be said ever to see) a blade of grass. I fall upon my knees inspeechless adoration at the moon; I hide my eyes in holy awe from a good VanGogh.Imagine then a ball in which the music is the choir celestial, the wine the wineof the Graal, or that of the Sabbath of the Adepts, and one's partner theInfinite and Eternal One, the True and Living God Most High!Go even to a common ball—the Moulin de la Galette will serve even the least ofmy magicians—with your whole soul aflame within you, and your whole willconcentrated on these transubstantiations, and tell me what miracle takes place!It is the hate of, the distaste for, life that sends one to the ball when one isold; when one is young one is on springs until the hour falls; but the love ofGod, which is the only true love, diminishes not with age; it grows deeper andintenser with every satisfaction. It seems as if in the noblest men thissecretion constantly increases—which certainly suggests an external reservoir—sothat age loses all its bitterness. We find “Brother Lawrence,” Nicholas Hermanof Lorraine, at the age of eighty in continuous enjoyment of union with God.Buddha at an equal age would run up and down the Eight High Trances like anacrobat on a ladder; stories not too dissimilar are told of Bishop Berkeley.Many persons have not attained union at all until middle age, and then haverarely lost it.It is true that genius in the ordinary sense of the word has nearly alwaysshowed itself in the young. Perhaps we should regard such cases as NicholasHerman as cases of acquired genius.Now I am certainly of opinion that genius can be acquired, or, in thealternative, that it is an almost universal possession. Its rarity may beattributed to the crushing influence of a corrupted society. It is rare to meeta youth without high ideals, generous thoughts, a sense of holiness, of his ownimportance, which, being interpreted, is, of his own identity with God. Threeyears in the world, and he is a bank clerk or even a government official. Onlythose who intuitively understand from early boyhood that they must stand out,and who have the incredible courage and endurance to do so in face of all thattyranny, callousness, and the scorn of inferiors can do; only these arrive atmanhood uncontaminated.Every serious or spiritual thought is made a jest; poets are thought “soft” and“cowardly,” apparently because they are the only boys with a will of their ownand courage to hold out against the whole school, boys and masters in league asonce were Pilate and Herod; honour is replaced by expediency, holiness byhypocrisy.Even where we find thoroughly good seed sprouting in favourable ground, toooften is there a frittering away of the forces. Facile encouragement of a poetor painter is far worse for him than any amount of opposition. Here again thesex question (S.Q. so-called by Tolstoyans, chastity-mongers, nut-fooders, andsuch who talk and think of nothing else) intrudes its horrid head. I believethat every boy is originally conscious of sex as sacred. But he does not knowwhat it is. With infinite diffidence he asks. The master replies with holyhorror; the boy with a low leer, a furtive laugh, perhaps worse.I am inclined to agree with the Head Master of Eton that pæderastic passionsamong schoolboys “do no harm”; further, I think them the only redeeming featureof sexual life at public schools.The Hindoos are wiser. At the well-watched hour of puberty the boy is preparedas for a sacrament; he is led to a duly consecrated temple, and there by a wiseand holy woman, skilled in the art, and devoted to this end, he is initiatedwith all solemnity into the mystery of life.The act is thus declared religious, sacred, impersonal, utterly apart fromamorism and eroticism and animalism and sentimentalism and all the othervilenesses that Protestantism has made of it.The Catholic Church did, I believe, to some extent preserve the Pagan tradition.Marriage is a sacrament.1 [part0005_split_017.html#c2-aft1] But in the attemptto deprive the act of all accretions which would profane it, the Fathers of theChurch added in spite of themselves other accretions which profaned it more.They tied it to property and inheritance. They wished it to serve both God andMammon.Rightly restraining the priest, who should employ his whole energy in themiracle of the Mass, they found their counsel a counsel of perfection. Themagical tradition was in part lost; the priest could not do what was expected ofhim, and the unexpended portion of his energy turned sour.Hence the thoughts of priests, like the thoughts of modern faddists, revolvedeternally around the S.Q.A special and Secret Mass, a Mass of the Holy Ghost, a Mass of the Mystery ofthe Incarnation, to be performed at stated intervals, might have saved bothmonks and nuns, and given the Church eternal dominion of the world."},{"pageContent":"IXTo return. The rarity of genius is in great part due to the destruction of itsyoung. Even as in physical life that is a favoured plant one of whose thousandseeds ever shoots forth a blade, so do conditions kill all but the strongestsons of genius.But just as rabbits increased apace in Australia, where even a missionary hasbeen known to beget ninety children in two years, so shall we be able to breedgenius if we can find the conditions which hamper it, and remove them.The obvious practical step to take is to restore the rites of Bacchus, Aphroditeand Apollo to their proper place. They should not be open to every one, andmanhood should be the reward of ordeal and initiation.The physical tests should be severe, and weaklings should be killed out ratherthan artificially preserved. The same remark applies to intellectual tests. Butsuch tests should be as wide as possible. I was an absolute duffer at school inall forms of athletics and games, because I despised them. I held, and stillhold, numerous mountaineering world's records. Similarly, examinations fail totest intelligence. Cecil Rhodes refused to employ any man with a Universitydegree. That such degrees lead to honour in England is a sign of England'sdecay, though even in England they are usually the stepping-stones to clericalidleness or pedagogic slavery.Such is a dotted outline of the picture that I wish to draw. If the power topossess property depended on a man's competence, and his perception of realvalues, a new aristocracy would at once be created, and the deadly fact thatsocial consideration varies with the power of purchasing champagne would ceaseto be a fact. Our pluto-hetairo-politicocracy would fall in a day.But I am only too well aware that such a picture is not likely to be painted. Wecan then only work patiently and in secret. We must select suitable material andtrain it in utmost reverence to these three master-methods, or aiding the soulin its genial orgasm."},{"pageContent":"XThis reverent attitude is of an importance which I cannot over-rate. Normalpeople find normal relief from any general or special excitement in the sexualact.Commander Marston, R.N., whose experiments in the effect of the tom-tom on themarried Englishwoman are classical and conclusive, has admirably described howthe vague unrest which she at first shows gradually assumes the sexual form, andculminates, if allowed to do so, in shameless masturbation or indecent advances.But this is a natural corollary of the proposition that married Englishwomen areusually unacquainted with sexual satisfaction. Their desires are constantlystimulated by brutal and ignorant husbands, and never gratified. This fact againaccounts for the amazing prevalence of Sapphism in London Society.The Hindus warn their pupils against the dangers of breathing exercises. Indeedthe slightest laxness in moral or physical tissues may cause the energyaccumulated by the practice to discharge itself by involuntary emission. I haveknown this happen in my own experience.It is then of the utmost importance to realize that the relief of the tension isto be found in what the Hebrews and the Greeks called prophesying, and which isbetter when organized into art. The disorderly discharge is mere waste, awilderness of howlings; the orderly discharge is a “Prometheus unbound,” or a“L'age d'airain,” according to the special aptitudes of the enthused person. Butit must be remembered that special aptitudes are very easy to acquire if thedriving force of enthusiasm be great. If you cannot keep the rules of others,you make rules of your own. One set turns out in the long run to be just as goodas another.Henri Rousseau, the douanier, was laughed at all his life. I laughed as heartilyas the rest; though, almost despite myself, I kept on saying (as the phrasegoes) “that I felt something; couldn't say what.”The moment it occurred to somebody to put up all his paintings in one room bythemselves, it was instantly apparent that his naïveté was the simplicity of aMaster.Let no one then imagine that I fail to perceive or underestimate the dangers ofemploying these methods. The occurrence even of so simple a matter as fatiguemight change a Las Meninas into a stupid sexual crisis.It will be necessary for most Englishmen to emulate the self-control of theArabs and Hindus, whose ideal is to de flower the greatest possible number ofvirgins—eighty is considered a fairly good performance—without completing theact.It is, indeed, of the first importance for the celebrant in any phallic rite tobe able to complete the act without even once allowing a sexual or sensualthought to invade his mind. The mind must be as absolutely detached from one'sown body as it is from another person's."},{"pageContent":"XIOf musical instruments few are suitable. The human voice is the best, and theonly one which can be usefully employed in chorus. Anything like an orchestraimplies infinite rehearsal, and introduces an atmosphere of artificiality. Theorgan is a worthy solo instrument, and is an orchestra in itself, while its toneand associations favour the religious idea.The violin is the most useful of all, for its every mood expresses the hungerfor the infinite, and yet it is so mobile that it has a greater emotional rangethan any of its competitors. Accompaniment must be dispensed with, unless aharpist be available.The harmonium is a horrible instrument, if only because of its associations; andthe piano is like unto it, although, if unseen and played by a Paderewski, itwould serve.The trumpet and the bell are excellent, to startle, at the crises of a ceremony.Hot, drubbing, passionate, in a different class of ceremony, a class moreintense and direct, but on the whole less exalted, the tom-tom stands alone. Itcombines well with the practice of mantra, and is the best accompaniment for anysacred dance."},{"pageContent":"XIIOf sacred dances the most practical for a gathering is the seated dance. Onesits cross-legged on the floor, and sways to and fro from the hips in time withthe mantra. A solo or duet of dancers as a spectacle rather distracts from thisexercise. I would suggest a very small and very brilliant light on the floor inthe middle of the room. Such a room is best floored with mosaic marble; anordinary Freemason's Lodge carpet is not a bad thing.The eyes, if they see anything at all, see then only the rhythmical ormechanical squares leading in perspective to the simple unwinking light.The swinging of the body with the mantra (which has a habit of rising andfalling as if of its own accord in a very weird way) becomes more accentuated;ultimately a curiously spasmodic stage occurs, and then the consciousnessflickers and goes out; perhaps breaks through into the divine consciousness,perhaps is merely recalled to itself by some variable in external impression.The above is a very simple description of a very simple and earnest form ofceremony, based entirely upon rhythm.It is very easy to prepare, and its results are usually very encouraging for thebeginner."},{"pageContent":"XIIIWine being a mocker and strong drink raging, its use is more likely to lead totrouble than mere music.One essential difficulty is dosage. One needs exactly enough; and, as Blakepoints out, one can only tell what is enough by taking too much. For each manthe dose varies enormously; so does it for the same man at different times.The ceremonial escape from this is to have a noiseless attendant to bear thebowl of libation, and present it to each in turn, at frequent intervals. Smalldoses should be drunk, and the bowl passed on, taken as the worshipper deemsadvisable. Yet the cup-bearer should be an initiate, and use his own discretionbefore presenting the bowl. The slightest sign that intoxication is masteringthe man should be a sign to him to pass that man. This practice can be easilyfitted to the ceremony previously described.If desired, instead of wine, the elixir introduced by me to Europe may beemployed. But its results, if used in this way, have not as yet been thoroughlystudied. It is my immediate purpose to repair this neglect."},{"pageContent":"XIVThe sexual excitement, which must complete the harmony of method, offers a moredifficult problem.It is exceptionally desirable that the actual bodily movements involved shouldbe decorous in the highest sense, and many people are so ill-trained that theywill be unable to regard such a ceremony with any but critical or lasciviouseyes; either would be fatal to all the good already done. It is presumablybetter to wait until all present are greatly exalted before risking aprofanation.It is not desirable, in my opinion, that the ordinary worshippers shouldcelebrate in public.The sacrifice should be single.Whether or no . . ."},{"pageContent":"XVThus far had I written when the distinguished poet, whose conversation with meupon the Mysteries had incited me to jot down these few rough notes, knocked atmy door. I told him that I was at work on the ideas suggested by him, andthat—well, I was rather stuck. He asked permission to glance at the MS. (for hereads English fluently, though speaking but a few words), and having done so,kindled and said: “If you come with me now, we will finish your essay.” Gladenough of any excuse to stop working, the more plausible the better, I hastenedto take down my coat and hat.“By the way,” he remarked in the automobile, “I take it that you do not mindgiving me the Word of Rose Croix.” Surprised, I exchanged the secrets ofI.N.R.I. with him. “And now, very excellent and perfect Prince,” he said, “whatfollows is under this seal.” And he gave me the most solemn of all Masonictokens. “You are about,” said he, “to compare your ideal with our real.”He touched a bell. The automobile stopped, and we got out. He dismissed thechauffeur. “Come,” he said, “we have a brisk half-mile.” We walked through thickwoods to an old house, where we were greeted in silence by a gentleman who,though in court dress, wore a very “practicable” sword. On satisfying him, wewere passed through a corridor to an anteroom, where another armed guardianawaited us. He, after a further examination, proceeded to offer me a courtdress, the insignia of a Sovereign Prince of Rose Croix, and a garter andmantle, the former of green silk, the latter of green velvet, and lined withcerise silk. “It is a low mass,” whispered the guardian. In this anteroom werethree or four others, both ladies and gentlemen, busily robing.In a third room we found a procession formed, and joined it. There weretwenty-six of us in all. Passing a final guardian we reached the chapel itself,at whose entrance stood a young man and a young woman, both dressed in simplerobes of white silk embroidered with gold, red and blue. The former bore a torchof resinous wood, the latter sprayed us as we passed with attar of roses from acup.The room in which we now were had at one time been a chapel; so much its shapedeclared. But the high altar was covered with a cloth that displayed the Roseand Cross, while above it were ranged seven candelabra, each of seven branches.The stalls had been retained; and at each knight's hand burned a taper ofrose-coloured wax, and a bouquet of roses was before him.In the centre of the nave was a great cross—a “calvary cross of ten squares,”measuring, say, six feet by five—painted in red upon a white board, at whoseedge were rings through which passed gilt staves. At each corner was a banner,bearing lion, bull, eagle and man, and from the top of their staves sprang acanopy of blue, wherein were figured in gold the twelve emblems of the Zodiac.Knights and Dames being installed, suddenly a bell tinkled in the architrave.Instantly all rose. The doors opened at a trumpet peal from without, and aherald advanced, followed by the High Priest and Priestess.The High Priest was a man of nearly sixty years, if I may judge by the whitebeard; but he walked with the springy yet assured step of the thirties. The HighPriestess, a proud, tall sombre woman of perhaps thirty summers, walked by hisside, their hands raised and touching as in the minuet. Their trains were borneby the two youths who had admitted us.All this while an unseen organ played an Introit.This ceased as they took their places at the altar. They faced West, waiting.On the closing of the doors the armed guard, who was clothed in a scarlet robeinstead of green, drew his sword, and went up and down the aisle, chantingexorcisms and swinging the great sword. All present drew their swords and facedoutward, holding the points in front of them. This part of the ceremony appearedinterminable. When it was over the girl and boy reappeared; bearing, the one abowl, the other a censer. Singing some litany or other, apparently in Greek,though I could not catch the words, they purified and consecrated the chapel.Now the High Priest and High Priestess began a litany in rhythmic lines of equallength. At each third response they touched hands in a peculiar manner; at eachseventh they kissed. The twenty-first was a complete embrace. The bell tinkledin the architrave; and they parted. The High Priest then took from the altar aflask curiously shaped to imitate a phallus. The High Priestess knelt andpresented a boat shaped cup of gold. He knelt opposite her, and did not pourfrom the flask.Now the Knights and Dames began a long litany; first a Dame in treble, then aKnight in bass, then a response in chorus of all present with the organ. ThisChorus was:EVOE HO, IACCHE! EPELTHON, EPELTHON, EVOE, IAO!Again and again it rose and fell. Towards its close, whether by “stage effect”or no I could not swear, the light over the altar grew rosy, then purple. TheHigh Priest sharply and suddenly threw up his hand; instant silence.He now poured out the wine from the flask. The High Priestess gave it to thegirl attendant, who bore it to all present.This was no ordinary wine. It has been said of vodki that it looks like waterand tastes like fire. With this wine the reverse is the case. It was of a richfiery gold in which flames of light danced and shook, but its taste was limpidand pure like fresh spring water. No sooner had I drunk of it, however, than Ibegan to tremble. It was a most astonishing sensation; I can imagine a man feelthus as he awaits his executioner, when he has passed through fear, and is allexcitement.I looked down my stall, and saw that each was similarly affected. During thelibation the High Priestess sang a hymn, again in Greek. This time I recognizedthe words; they were those of an ancient Ode to Aphrodite.The boy attendant now descended to the red cross, stooped and kissed it; then hedanced upon it in such a way that he seemed to be tracing the patterns of amarvellous rose of gold, for the percussion caused a shower of bright dust tofall from the canopy. Meanwhile the litany (different words, but the samechorus) began again. This time it was a duet between the High Priest andPriestess. At each chorus Knights and Dames bowed low. The girl moved roundcontinuously, and the bowl passed.This ended in the exhaustion of the boy, who fell fainting on the cross. Thegirl immediately took the bowl and put it to his lips. Then she raised him, and,with the assistance of the Guardian of the Sanctuary, led him out of the chapel.The bell again tinkled in the architrave.The herald blew a fanfare.The High Priest and High Priestess moved stately to each other and embraced, inthe act unloosing the heavy golden robes which they wore. These fell, twin lakesof gold. I now saw her dressed in a garment of white watered silk, linedthroughout (as it appeared later) with ermine.The High Priest's vestment was an elaborate embroidery of every colour,harmonized by exquisite yet robust art. He wore also a breastplate correspondingto the canopy; a sculptured “beast” at each corner in gold, while the twelvesigns of the Zodiac were symbolized by the stones of the breastplate.The bell tinkled yet again, and the herald again sounded his trumpet. Thecelebrants moved hand in hand down the nave while the organ thundered forth itssolemn harmonies.All the Knights and Dames rose and gave the secret sign of the Rose Croix.It was at this part of the ceremony that things began to happen to me. I becamesuddenly aware that my body had lost both weight and tactile sensibility. Myconsciousness seemed to be situated no longer in my body. I “mistook myself,” ifI may use the phrase, for one of the stars in the canopy.In this way I missed seeing the celebrants actually approach the cross. The belltinkled again; I came back to myself, and then I saw that the High Priestess,standing at the foot of the cross, had thrown her robe over it, so that thecross was no longer visible. There was only a board covered with ermine. She wasnow naked but for her coloured and jewelled head-dress and the heavy torque ofgold about her neck, and the armlets and anklets that matched it. She began tosing in a soft strange tongue, so low and smoothly that in my partialbewilderment I could not hear all; but I caught a few words, Io Paian! Io Pan!and a phrase in which the words Iao Sabao ended emphatically a sentence in whichI caught the words Eros, Thelema and Sebazo.While she did this she unloosed the breastplate and gave it to the girlattendant. The robe followed; I saw that they were naked and unashamed. For thefirst time there was absolute silence.Now, from an hundred jets surrounding the board poured forth a perfumed purplesmoke. The world was wrapt in a fond gauze of mist, sacred as the clouds uponthe mountains.Then at a signal given by the High Priest, the bell tinkled once more. Thecelebrants stretched out their arms in the form of a cross, interlacing theirfingers. Slowly they revolved through three circles and a half. She then laidhim down upon the cross, and took her own appointed place.The organ now again rolled forth its solemn music.I was lost to everything. Only this I saw, that the celebrants made no expectedmotion. The movements were extremely small and yet extremely strong.This must have continued for a great length of time. To me it seemed as ifeternity itself could not contain the variety and depth of my experiences.Tongue nor pen could record them; and yet I am fain to attempt the impossible.1. I was, certainly and undoubtedly, the star in the canopy. This star was anincomprehensibly enormous world of pure flame.2. I suddenly realized that the star was of no size whatever. It was not thatthe star shrank, but that it (= I) became suddenly conscious of infinite space.3. An explosion took place. I was in consequence a point of light, infinitelysmall, yet infinitely bright, and this point was without position.4. Consequently this point was ubiquitous, and there was a feeling of infinitebewilderment, blinded after a very long time by a gush of infinite rapture (Iuse the word “blinded” as if under constraint; I should have preferred to usethe words “blotted out” or “overwhelmed” or “illuminated”).5. This infinite fullness—I have not described it as such, but it was that—wassuddenly changed into a feeling of infinite emptiness, which became conscious asa yearning.6. These two feelings began to alternate, always with suddenness, and without inany way overlapping, with great rapidity.7. This alternation must have occurred fifty times—I had rather have said anhundred.8. The two feelings suddenly became one. Again the word explosion is the onlyone that gives any idea of it.9. I now seemed to be conscious of everything at once, that it was at the sametime one and many. I say “at once,” that is, I was not successively all things,but instantaneously.10. This being, if I may call it being seemed to drop into an infinite abyss ofNothing.11. While this “falling” lasted, the bell suddenly tinkled three times. Iinstantly became my normal self, yet with a constant awareness, which has neverleft me to this hour, that the truth of the matter is not this normal “I” but“That” which is still dropping into Nothing. I am assured by those who know thatI may be able to take up the thread if I attend another ceremony.The tinkle died away. The girl attendant ran quickly forward and folded theermine over the celebrants. The herald blew a fanfare, and the Knights and Damesleft their stalls. Advancing to the board, we took hold of the gilded carryingpoles, and followed the herald in procession out of the chapel, bearing thelitter to a small side-chapel leading out of the middle anteroom, where we leftit, the guard closing the doors.In silence we disrobed, and left the house. About a mile through the woods wefound my friend's automobile waiting.I asked him, if that was a low mass, might I not be permitted to witness a HighMass?“Perhaps,” he answered with a curious smile, “if all they tell of you is true.”In the meanwhile he permitted me to describe the ceremony and its results asfaithfully as I was able, charging me only to give no indication of the citynear which it took place.I am willing to indicate to initiates of the Rose Croix degree of Masonry underproper charter from the genuine authorities (for there are spurious Masonsworking under a forged charter) the address of a person willing to considertheir fitness to affiliate to a Chapter practising similar rites."},{"pageContent":"XVII consider it supererogatory to continue my essay on the Mysteries and myanalysis of Energized Enthusiasm.1 [part0005_split_009.html#c2-ft1] Of course there has been a school of devilishananders that has held the act in itself to be “wicked.” Of such blasphemers ofNature let no further word be said."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/00014.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"THE STAR SAPPHIRELet the Adept be armed with his Magick Rood (and provided with his mystic Rose).In the centre, let him give the L.V.X. signs; or if he know them, if he will anddare do them, and can keep silent about them, the signs of N.O.X. being thesigns of Puer, Vir, Puella, Mulier.

Be obstinate, and be not obstinate. Understand thatthe yielding of the Yoni is one with the lengthening of the Lingam. Thou artboth these; and thy vow is but the rustling of the wind on Mount Meru.17. Now shalt thou adore me who am the Eye and the Tooth, the Goat of theSpirit, the Lord of Creation. I am the Eye in the Triangle, the Silver Star thatye adore.18. I am Baphomet, that is the Eightfold Word that shall be equilibrated withthe Three.19. There is no act or passion that shall not be a hymn in mine honour.20. All holy things and all symbolic things shall be my sacraments.21. These animals are sacred unto me; the goat, and the duck, and the ass, andthe gazelle, the man, the woman and the child.22. All corpses are sacred unto me; they shall not be touched save in mineeucharist. All lonely places are sacred unto me; where one man gathereth himselftogether in my name, there will I leap forth in the midst of him.23. I am the hideous god; and who mastereth me is uglier than I.24. Yet I give more than Bacchus and Apollo; my gifts exceed the olive and thehorse.25. Who worshippeth me must worship me with many rites.26. I am concealed with all concealments; when the Most Holy Ancient One isstripped and driven through the marketplace I am still secret and apart.27. Whom I love I chastise with many rods.28. All things are sacred to me; no thing is sacred from me.29. For there is no holiness where I am not.30. Fear not when I fall in the fury of the storm; for mine acorns are blownafar by the wind; and verily I shall rise again, and my children about me, sothat we shall uplift our forest in Eternity.31. Eternity is the storm that covereth me.32. I am Existence, the Existence that existeth not save through its ownExistence, that is beyond the Existence of Existences, and rooted deeper thanthe No-Thing-Tree in the Land of No-Thing.33. Now therefore thou knowest when I am within thee, when my hood is spreadover thy skull, when my might is more than the penned Indus, and resistless asthe Giant Glacier.34. For as thou art before a lewd woman in Thy nakedness in the bazar, sucked upby her slyness and smiles, so art thou wholly and no more in part before thesymbol of the beloved, though it be but a Pisacha or a Yantra or a Deva.35. And in all shalt thou create the Infinite Bliss, and the next link of theInfinite Chain.36. This chain reaches from Eternity to Eternity, ever in triangles—is not mysymbol a triangle?—ever in circles—is not the symbol of the Beloved a circle?Therein is all progress base illusion, for every circle is alike and everytriangle alike!37. But the progress is progress, and progress is rapture, constant, dazzling,showers of light, waves of dew, flames of the hair of the Great Goddess, flowersof the roses that are about her neck, Amen!38. Therefore lift up thyself as I am lifted up. Hold thyself in as I am masterto accomplish. At the end, be the end far distant as the stars that lie in thenavel of Nuit, do thou slay thyself as I at the end am slain, in the death thatis life, in the peace that is mother of war, in the darkness that holds light inhis hand as a harlot that plucks a jewel from her nostrils.39. So therefore the beginning is delight, and the End is delight, and delightis in the midst, even as the Indus is water in the cavern of the glacier, andwater among the greater hills and the lesser hills and through the ramparts ofthe hills and through the plains, and water at the mouth thereof when it leapsforth into the mighty sea, yea, into the mighty sea.[The Interpretation of this Book will be given to members of the Grade ofDominus Liminis on application, each to his Adeptus.]"},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/00017.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/00018.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"LIBER CHETHVEL VALLUM ABIEGNISVB FIGVRÂ CLVI1.

This is the book of Uniting Himself to a particular Deity by devotion.1. Considerations before the Threshold. First, concerning the choice of aparticular Deity. This matter is of no import, sobeit that thou choose onesuited to thine own highest nature. Howsoever, this method is not so suitablefor gods austere as Saturn, or intellectual as Thoth. But for such deities as inthemselves partake in anywise of love it is a perfect mode.2. Concerning the prime method of this Magick Art. Let the devotee consider wellthat although Christ and Osiris be one, yet the former is to be worshipped withChristian, and the latter with Egyptian rites. And this although the ritesthemselves are ceremonially equivalent. There should, however, be one symboldeclaring the transcending of such limitations; and with regard to the Deityalso, there should be some one affirmation of his identity both with all othersimilar gods of other nations, and with the Supreme of whom all are but partialreflections.3. Concerning the chief place of devotion. This is the Heart of the devotee, andshould be symbolically represented by that room or spot which he loves best. Andthe dearest spot therein shall be the shrine of his temple. It is mostconvenient if this shrine and altar should be sequestered in woods, or in aprivate grove, or garden. But let it be protected from the profane.4. Concerning the Image of the Deity. Let there be an image of the Deity; first,because in meditation there is mindfulness induced thereby; and second, becausea certain power enters and inhabits it by virtue of the ceremonies; or so it issaid, and We deny it not. Let this image be the most beautiful and perfect whichthe devotee is able to procure; or if he be able to paint or to carve the same,it is all the better. As for Deities with whose nature no Image is compatible,let them be worshipped in an empty shrine. Such are Brahma and Allah. Also somepost-captivity conceptions of Jehovah.5. Further concerning the shrine. Let this shrine be furnished appropriately asto its ornaments, according to the book 777. With ivy and pine-cones, that is tosay, for Bacchus, and let lay before him both grapes and wine. So also for Cereslet there be corn, and cakes; or for Diana moon-wort and pale herbs, and purewater. Further, it is well to support the shrine with talismans of the planets,signs and elements appropriate. But these should be made according to the rightIngenium of the Philosophus by the light of the Book 777 during the course ofhis Devotion. It is also well, nevertheless, if a magick circle with the rightsigns and names be made beforehand.6. Concerning the ceremonies. Let the Philosophus prepare a powerful Invocationof the particular Deity, according to his Ingenium. But let it consist of theseseveral parts:First, an Imprecation, as of a slave unto his Lord.Second, an Oath, as of a vassal to his Liege.Third, a Memorial, as of a child to his Parent.Fourth, an Orison, as of a Priest unto his God.Fifth, a Colloquy, as of a Brother with his Brother.Sixth, a Conjuration, as of a Friend with his Friend.Seventh, a Madrigal, as of a Lover to his Mistress.And mark well that the first should be of awe, the second of fealty, the thirdof dependence, the fourth of adoration, the fifth of confidence, the sixth ofcomradeship, the seventh of passion.7. Further concerning the ceremonies. Let then this Invocation be the principalpart of an ordered ceremony. And in this ceremony let the Philosophus in no wiseneglect the service of a menial. Let him sweep and garnish the place, sprinklingit with water or with wine as is appropriate to the particular Deity, andconsecrating it with oil, and with such ritual as may seem him best. And let allbe done with intensity and minuteness.8. Concerning the period of devotion, and the hours thereof. Let a fixed periodbe set for the worship; and it is said that the least time is nine days byseven, and the greatest seven years by nine. And concerning the hours, let theCeremony be performed every day thrice, or at least once, and let the sleep ofthe Philosophus be broken for some purpose of devotion at least once in everynight.Now to some it may seem best to appoint fixed hours for the ceremony, to othersit may seem that the ceremony should be performed as the spirit moves them so todo: for this there is no rule.9. Concerning the Robes and Instruments, The Wand and Cup are to be chosen forthis Art; never the Sword or Dagger, never the Pantacle, unless that Pantaclechance to be of a nature harmonious. But even so it is best to keep the Wand andCup; and if one must choose, the Cup.For the Robes, that of a Philosophus, or that of an Adept Within is mostsuitable; or, the robe best fitted for the service of the particular Deity, as abassara for Bacchus, a white robe for Vesta. So also, for Vesta, one might usefor instrument the Lamp; or the sickle, for Chronos.10. Concerning the Incense and Libations. The incense should follow the natureof the particular Deity; as, mastic for Mercury, dittany for Persephone. Alsothe libations, as, a decoction of nightshade for Melancholia, or of Indian hempfor Uranus.11. Concerning the harmony of the ceremonies. Let all these things be rightlyconsidered, and at length, in language of the utmost beauty at the command ofthe Philosophus, accompanied, if he have skill, by music, and interwoven, if theparticular Deity be jocund, with dancing. And all being carefully prepared andrehearsed, let it be practised daily until it be wholly rhythmical with hisaspiration, and as it were, a part of his being.12. Concerning the variety of the ceremonies. Now, seeing that every mandiffereth essentially from every other man, albeit in essence he is identical,let also these ceremonies assert their identity by their diversity. For thisreason do We leave much herein to the right Ingenium of the Philosophus.13. Concerning the life of the devotee. First, let his way of life be such as ispleasing to the particular Deity. Thus to invoke Neptune, let him go a-fishing;but if Hades, let him not approach the water that is hateful to Him.14. Further, concerning the life of the devotee. Let him cut away from his lifeany act, word, or thought, that is hateful to the particular Deity; as,unchastity in the case of Artemis, evasions in the case of Ares. Besides this,he should avoid all harshness or unkindness of any kind in thought, word, ordeed, seeing that above the particular Deity is One in whom all is One. Yet alsohe may deliberately practise cruelties, where the particular Deity manifests Hislove in that manner; as in the case of Kali, and of Pan. And therefore, beforethe beginning of his period of devotion, let him practise according to the rulesof Liber Jugorum.15. Further concerning the life of the devotee. Now, as many are fully occupiedwith their affairs, let it be known that this method is adaptable to thenecessities of all.And We bear witness that this which followeth is the Crux and Quintessence ofthe whole Method.First, if he have no Image, let him take anything soever, and consecrate it asan Image of his God. Likewise with his robes and instruments, his suffumigationsand libations: for his Robe hath he not a night-dress; for his instrument awalking-stick; for his suffumigation a burning match, for his libation a glassof water?But let him consecrate each thing that he useth to the service of thatparticular Deity, and not profane the same to any other use.16. Continuation. Next, concerning his time, if it be short. Let him labourmentally upon his Invocation, concentrating it, and let him perform thisInvocation in his heart whenever he hath the leisure. And let him seize eagerlyupon every opportunity for this.17. Continuation. Third, even if he have leisure and preparation, let him seekever to bring inward the symbols, so that even in his well-ordered shrine thewhole ceremony revolve inwardly in his heart, that is to say in the temple ofhis body, of which the outer temple is but an image.For in the brain is the shrine, and there is no Image therein; and the breath ofman is the incense and the libation.18. Continuation. Further concerning occupation. Let the devotee transmutewithin the alembic of his heart every thought, or word, or act into thespiritual gold of his devotion.As thus: eating. Let him say: “I eat this food in gratitude to my Deity thathath sent it to me, in order to gain strength for my devotion to Him.”Or: sleeping. Let him say: “I lie down to sleep, giving thanks for this blessingfrom my Deity, in order that I may be refreshed for new devotion to Him.”Or: reading. Let him say: “I read this book that I may study the nature of myDeity, that further knowledge of Him may inspire me with deeper devotion toHim.”Or: working. Let him say: “I drive my spade into the earth that fresh flowers(fruit, or what not) may spring up to His glory, and that I, purified by toil,may give better devotion to Him.”Or, whatever it may be that he is doing, let him reason it out in his own mind,drawing it through circumstance and circumstance to that one end and conclusionof the matter. And let him not perform the act until he hath done this.As it is written: Liber VII. cap. v.—22. “Every breath, every word, every thought, is an act of love with thee.23. “The beat of my heart is the pendulum of love.24. “The songs of me are the soft sighs:25. “The thoughts of me are very rapture:26. “And my deeds are the myriads of Thy children, the stars and the atoms.”And Remember Well, that if thou wert in truth a lover, all this wouldst thou doof thine own nature without the slightest flaw or failure in the minutest partthereof.19. Concerning the Lections. Let the Philosophus read solely in his copies ofthe holy books of Thelema, during the whole period of his devotion. But if heweary, then let him read books which have no part whatever in love, as forrecreation.But let him copy out each verse of Thelema which bears upon this matter, andponder them, and comment thereupon. For therein is a wisdom and a magic too deepto utter in any other wise.20. Concerning the Meditations. Herein is the most potent method of attainingunto the End, for him who is thoroughly prepared, being purified by the practiceof the Transmutation of deed into devotion, and consecrated by the rightperformance of the holy ceremonies. Yet herein is danger, for that the Mind isfluid as quicksilver, and bordereth upon the Abyss, and is beset by many sirensand devils that seduce and attack it to destroy it. Therefore let the devoteebeware, and precise accurately his meditations, even as a man should build acanal from sea to sea.21. Continuation. Let then the Philosophus meditate upon all love that hath everstirred him. There is the love of David and of Jonathan, and the love of Abrahamand Isaac, and the love of Lear and Cordelia, and the love of Damon and Pythias,and the love of Sappho and Atthis, and the love of Romeo and Juliet, and thelove of Dante and Beatrice, and the love of Paolo and Francesca, and the love ofCaesar and Lucrezia Borgia, and the love of Aucassin and Nicolette, and the loveof Daphnis and Chloe, and the love of Cornelia and Caius Gracchus, and the loveof Bacchus and Ariadne, and the love of Cupid and Psyche, and the love ofEndymion and Artemis, and the love of Demeter and Persephone, and the love ofVenus and Adonis, and the love of Lakshmi and Vishnu, and the love of Siva andBhavani, and the love of Buddha and Ananda, and the love of Jesus and John, andmany more.Also there is the love of many saints for their particular deity, as of StFrancis of Assisi for Christ, of Sri Sabhapaty Swami for Maheswara, of AbdullahHaji Shirazi for Allah, of St Ignatius Loyola for Mary, and many more.Now do thou take one such story every night, and enact it in thy mind, graspingeach identity with infinite care and zest, and do thou figure thyself as one ofthe lovers and thy Deity as the other. Thus do thou pass through all adventuresof love, not omitting one; and to each do thou conclude: How pale a reflectionis this of my love for this Deity!Yet from each shalt thou draw some knowledge of love, some intimacy with love,that shall aid thee to perfect thy love. Thus learn the humility of love fromone, its obedience from another, its intensity from a third, its purity from afourth, its peace from yet a fifth.So then thy love being made perfect, it shall be worthy of that perfect love ofHis.22. Further concerning meditation. Moreover, let the Philosophus imagine tohimself that he hath indeed succeeded in his devotion, and that his Lord hathappeared to him, and that they converse as may be fitting.23. Concerning the Mysterious Triangle. Now then as three cords separately maybe broken by a child, while those same cords duly twisted may bind a giant, letthe Philosophus learn to entwine these three methods of Magic into a Spell.To this end let him understand that as they are One, because the end is one, soare they One because the method is One, even the method of turning the mindtoward the particular Deity by love in every act.And lest thy twine slip, here is a little cord that wrappeth tightly round andround all, even the Mantram or Continuous Prayer.24. Concerning the Mantram or Continuotis Prayer. Let the Philosophus weave theName of the Particular Deity into a sentence short and rhythmical; as, forArtemis: Image [../images/00030.jpeg], Image [../images/00031.jpeg], Image[../images/00032.jpeg]; or, for Shiva: Namo Shivaya namaha Aum; or, for Mary:Ave Maria; or, for Pan, Image [../images/00033.jpeg] Image[../images/00034.jpeg]; or, for Allah: Hua Allahu alazi lailaha illa Hua.Let him repeat this day and night without cessation mechanically in his brain,which is thus made ready for the Advent of that Lord, and armed against allother.25. Concerning the Active and the Passive. Let the Philosophus change from theactive love of his particular Deity to a state of passive awaiting, even almosta repulsion, the repulsion not of distaste, but of a sublime modesty.As it is written, Liber LXV. ii. 59. I have called unto Thee, and I havejourneyed unto Thee, and it availed me not. 60. I waited patiently, and Thouwast with me from the beginning.Then let him change back to the Active, until a veritable rhythm is establishedbetween the states, as it were the swinging of a Pendulum. But let him reflectthat a vast intelligence is required for this; for he must stand as it werealmost without himself to watch those phases of himself. And to do this is ahigh Art, and pertaineth not altogether to the grade of Philosophus. Neither isit of itself helpful, but rather the reverse, in this especial practice.26. Concerning Silence. Now there may come a time in the course of this practicewhen the outward symbols of devotion cease, when the soul is as it were dumb inthe presence of its God. Mark that this is not a cessation, but a transmutationof the barren seed of prayer into the green shoot of yearning. This yearning isspontaneous, and it shall be left to grow, whether it be sweet or bitter. Foroften times it is as the torment of hell in which the soul burns and writhesunceasingly. Yet it ends, and at its end continue openly thy Method.27. Concerning Dryness. Another state wherein at times the soul may fall is thisdark night. And this is indeed purifying in such depths that the soul cannotfathom it. It is less like pain than like death. But it is the necessary deaththat comes before the rising of a body glorified.This state must be endured with fortitude; and no means of alleviating it may beemployed. It may be broken up by the breaking up of the whole Method, and areturn to the world without. This cowardice not only destroys the value of allthat has gone before, but destroys the value of the Oath of Fealty that thouhast sworn, and makes thy Will a mockery to men and gods.28. Concerning the Deceptions of the Devil. Note well that in this state ofdryness a thousand seductions will lure thee away; also a thousand means ofbreaking thine oath in spirit without breaking it in letter. Against this thoumayst repeat the words of thine oath aloud again and again until the temptationbe overcome.Also the devil will represent to thee that it were much better for thisoperation that thou do thus and thus, and seek to affright thee by fears for thyhealth or thy reason.Or he may send against thee visions worse than madness.Against all this there is but one remedy, the Discipline of thine Oath. So thenthou shalt go through ceremonies meaningless and hideous to thee, and blasphemeshalt thou against thy Deity and curse Him. And this mattereth little, for it isnot thou, so be that thou adhere to the Letter of thine Obligation. For thySpiritual Sight is closed, and to trust it is to be led unto the precipice, andhurled therefrom.29. Further of this matter. Now also subtler than all these terrors are theIllusions of Success. For one instant's self-satisfaction or Expansion of thySpirit, especially in this state of dryness, and thou art lost. For thou maystattain the False Union with the Demon himself. Beware also of even the pridewhich rises from having resisted the temptations.But so many and so subtle are the wiles of Choronzon that the whole world couldnot contain their enumeration.The answer to one and all is the persistence in the literal fulfilment of theroutine. Beware, then, last, of that devil who shall whisper in thine ear thatthe letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life, and answer: Except a corn ofwheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone; but if it die, it bringethforth much fruit.Yet shalt thou also beware of disputation with the devil, and pride in thecleverness of thine answers to him. Therefore. if thou hast not lost the powerof silence, let it be first and last employed against him.30. Concerning the Enflaming of the Heart. Now learn that thy methods are dryone and all. Intellectual exercises, moral exercises, they are not Love. Yet asa man, rubbing two dry sticks together for long, suddenly found a spark, so alsofrom time to time will true love leap unasked into thy meditation. Yet thisshall die and be reborn again and again. It may be that thou hast no tindernear.In the end shall come suddenly a great flame and a devouring, and burn theeutterly.Now of these sparks, and of these splutterings of flame, and of these beginningsof the Infinite Fire, thou shalt thus be aware. For the sparks thy heart shallleap up, and thy ceremony or meditation or toil shall seem of a sudden to go ofits own will; and for the little flames this shall be increased in volume andintensity; and for the beginnings of the Infinite Fire thy ceremony shall becaught up unto ravishing song, and thy meditation shall be ecstasy, and thy toilshall be a delight exceeding all pleasure thou hast ever known.And of the Great Flame that answereth thee it may not be spoken; for therein isthe End of this Magick Art of Devotion.31. Considerations with regard to the use of symbols. It is to be noted thatpersons of powerful imagination, will, and intelligence have no need of thesematerial symbols. There have been certain saints who are capable of love for anidea as such without it being otherwise than degraded by idolising it, to usethis word in its true sense. Thus one may be impassioned of beauty, without eventhe need of so small a concretion of it as “the beauty of Apollo,” “the beautyof roses,” “the beauty of Attis.” Such persons are rare; it may be doubtedwhether Plato himself attained to any vision of absolute beauty withoutattaching to it material objects in the first place. A second class is able tocontemplate ideals through this veil; a third class need a double veil, andcannot think of the beauty of a rose without a rose before them. For such isthis Method of most use; yet let them know that there is this danger therein,that they may mistake the gross body of the symbol for the idea made concretethereby.32. Considerations of further danger to those not purged of material thought.Let it be remembered that in the nature of the love itself is danger. The lustof the satyr for the nymph is indeed of the same nature as the affinity ofQuicklime for water on the one hand, and of the love of Ab for Ama on the other;so also is the triad Osiris, Isis, Horus like that of a horse, mare, foal, andof red, blue, purple. And this is the foundation of Correspondences.But it were false to say “Horus is a foal” or “Horus is purple.” One may say“Horus resembles a foal in this respect, that he is the oft spring of twocomplementary beings.”33. Further of this matter. So also many have said truly that all is one. andfalsely that since earth is That One, and ocean is That One, therefore earth isocean. Unto Him good is illusion, and evil is illusion; therefore good is evil.By this fallacy of logic are many men destroyed.Moreover, there are those who take the image for the God; as who should say, myheart is in Tiphereth, and an Adeptus is in Tiphereth; I am therefore an adept.And in this practice the worst danger is this, that the love which is its weaponshould fail in one of two ways.First, if the love lack any quality of love, so long is it not ideal love. Forit is written of the Perfected One: “There is no member of my body which is notthe member of some god.” Therefore let not the Philosophus despise any form oflove, but harmonise all. As it is written: Liber LXI. 32. “So thereforePerfection abideth not in the Pinnacles or in the Foundation, but in the harmonyof One with all.”Second, if any part of this love exceed, there is disease therein. As, in thelove of Othello for Desdemona, love's jealousy overcame love's tenderness, somay it be in this love of a particular Deity. And this is more likely, since inthis divine love no element may be omitted.It is by virtue of this completeness that no human love may in any way attain tomore than to forthshadow a little part thereof.34. Concerning Mortifications. These are not necessary to this method. On thecontrary, they may destroy the concentration, as counter-irritants to, and soalleviations of, the supreme mortification which is the Absence of the Deityinvoked.Yet as in mortal love arises a distaste for food, or a pleasure in thingsnaturally painful, this perversion should be endured and allowed to take itscourse. Yet not to the interference with natural bodily health, whereby theinstrument of the soul might be impaired.And concerning sacrifices for love's sake, they are natural to this Method, andright.But concerning voluntary privations and tortures, without use save as againstthe devotee, they are generally not natural to healthy natures, and wrong. Forthey are selfish. To scourge one's self serves not one's master; yet to denyone's self bread that one's child may have cake is the act of a true mother.35. Further concerning Mortifications. If thy body, on which thou ridest, be sodisobedient a beast that by no means will he travel in the desired direction, orif thy mind be baulkish and eloquent as Balaam's fabled Ass, then let thepractice be abandoned. Let the shrine be covered in sackcloth, and do thou puton habits of lamentation, and abide alone. And do thou return most austerely tothe practice of Liber Jugorum, testing thyself by a standard higher than thathitherto accomplished, and punishing effractions with a heavier goad. Nor dothou return to thy devotion until that body and mind are tamed and trained toall manner of peaceable going.36. Concerning minor methods adjuvant in the ceremonies.I. Rising on the planes. By this method mayst thou assist the imagination at thetime of concluding thine Invocation. Act as taught in Liber O, by the light ofLiber 777.37. Concerning minor methods adjuvant in the ceremonies.II. Talismanic magic. Having made by thine Ingenium a talisman or pantacle torepresent the particular Deity, and consecrated it with infinite love and care,do thou burn it ceremonially before the shrine, as if thereby giving up theshadow for the substance. But it is useless to do this unless thou do really inthine heart value the talisman beyond all else that thou hast.38. Concerning minor methods adjuvant in the ceremonies.III. Rehearsal. It may assist if the traditional history of the particular Deitybe rehearsed before him; perhaps this is best done in dramatic form. This methodis the main one recommended in the “Exercitios Espirituales” of St Ignatius,whose work may be taken as a model. Let the Philosophus work out the legend ofhis own particular Deity, and apportioning days to events, live that life inimagination, exercising the five senses in turn, as occasion arises.39. Concerning minor matters adjuvant in the ceremonies.IV. Duresse. This method consists in cursing a deity recalcitrant; as,threatening ceremonially “to burn the blood of Osiris, and to grind down hisbones to powder.” This method is altogether contrary to the spirit of love,unless the particular Deity be himself savage and relentless; as, Jehovah orKali. In such a case the desire to perform constraint and cursing may be thesign of the assimilation of the spirit of the devotee with that of his God, andso an advance to the Union with Him.40. Concerning the value of this particular form of Union or Samadhi. AllSamadhi is defined as the ecstatic union of subject and object in consciousness,with the result that a third thing arises which partakes in no way of the natureof the two.It would seem at first sight that it is of no importance whatever to choose anobject of meditation. For example, the Samadhi called Atmadarshana might arisefrom simple concentration of the thought on an imagined triangle, or on theheart.But as the union of two bodies in chemistry may be endothermic or exothermic,the combination of Oxygen with Nitrogen is gentle, while that of Oxygen withHydrogen is explosive; and as it is found that the most heat is disengaged as arule by the union of bodies most opposite in character, and that the compoundresulting from such is most stable, so it seems reasonable to suggest that themost important and enduring Samadhi results from the contemplation of the Objectmost opposite to the devotee. [On other planes, it has been suggested that themost opposed types make the best marriages and produce the healthiest children.The greatest pictures and operas are those in which violent extremes areblended, and so generally in every field of activity. Even in mathematics, thegreatest parallelogram is formed if the lines composing it are set at rightangles. ED.]41. Conclusions from the foregoing. It may then be suggested to the Philosophus,that although his work will be harder his reward will be greater if he choose aDeity most remote from his own nature. This method is harder and higher thanthat of Liber E. For a simple object as there suggested is of the same nature asthe commonest things of life, while even the meanest Deity is beyond uninitiatedhuman understanding. On the same plane, too, Venus is nearer to man thanAphrodite, Aphrodite than Isis, Isis than Babalon, Babalon than Nuit.Let him decide therefore according to his discretion on the one hand and hisaspiration on the other: and let not one outrun his fellow.42. Further concerning the value of this Method. Certain objections arise.Firstly, in the nature of all human love is illusion, and a certain blindness.Nor is there any true love below the Veil of the Abyss. For this reason We givethis Method to the Philosophus, as the reflection of the Exempt Adept, whoreflects the Magister Templi and the Magus. Let then the Philosophus attain thismethod as a foundation of the higher Methods to be given to him when he attainsthose higher grades.Another objection lies in the partiality of this Method. This is equally adefect characteristic of the Grade.43. Concerning a notable danger of Success. It may occur that owing to thetremendous power of the Samadhi, overcoming all other memories as it should anddoes do, that the mind of the devotee may be obsessed, so that he declare hisparticular Deity to be sole God and Lord. This error has been the foundation ofall dogmatic religions, and so the cause of more misery than all other errorscombined.The Philosophus is peculiarly liable to this because from the nature of theMethod he cannot remain sceptical; he must for the time believe in hisparticular Deity. But let him (1) consider that this belief is only a weapon inhis hands, (2) affirm sufficiently that his Deity is but an emanation orreflection or eidolon of a Being beyond him, as was said in Paragraph 2. For ifhe fail herein, since man cannot remain permanently in Samadhi, the memorisedImage in his mind will be degraded, and replaced by the corresponding Demon, tohis utter ruin.Therefore, after Success, let him not delight overmuch in his Deity, but ratherbusy himself with his other work, not permitting that which is but a step tobecome a goal. As it is written also, Liber CLXXXV.: “remembering thatPhilosophy is the Equilibrium of him that is in the House of Love.”44. Concerning secrecy, and the rites of Blood. During this practice it is mostwise that the Philosophus utter no word concerning his working, as if it were aForbidden Love that consumeth him. But let him answer fools according to theirfolly; for since he cannot conceal his love from his fellows, he must speak tothem as they may understand.And as many Deities demand sacrifices, one of men, another of cattle, a third ofdoves, let these sacrifices be replaced by the true sacrifices in thine ownheart. Yet if thou must symbolise them outwardly for the hardness of thineheart, let thine own blood, and not another's, be spilt before that altar.1[part0010_split_002.html#c7-aft1]Nevertheless, forget not that this practice is dangerous, and may cause themanifestation of evil things, hostile and malicious, to thy great hurt.45. Concerning a further sacrifice. Of this it shall be understood that nothingis to be spoken; nor need anything be spoken to him that hath wisdom tocomprehend the number of the paragraph. And this sacrifice is fatal beyond all,unless it be a sacrifice indeed. Yet there are those who have dared and achievedthereby.46. Concerning yet a further sacrifice. Here it is spoken of actual mutilation.Such acts are abominable; and while they may bring success in this Method, forman absolute bar to all further progress.And they are in any case more likely to lead to madness than to Samadhi. Heindeed who purposeth them is already mad.47. Concerning hitman affection. During this practice thou shalt in no wisewithdraw thyself from human relations, only figuring to thyself that thy fatheror thy brother or thy wife is as it were an image of thy particular Deity. Thusshall they gain, and not lose, by thy working. Only in the case of thy wife thisis difficult, since she is more to thee than all others, and in this case thoumayst act with temperance, lest her personality overcome and destroy that of thyDeity.48. Concerning the Holy Guardian Angel Do thou in no wise confuse thisinvocation with that.49. The Benediction. And so may the Love that passeth all Understanding keepyour hearts and minds through IAΩ AΔΩNAI CABAΩ and through BABALON of the Cityof the Pyramids, and through Astarté the Starry One green-girdled in the nameARARITA.

Meditate upon Nuit as the Continuous One resolved into None and Two as thephases of her being.[For the Universe being self-contained must be capable of expression by theformula (n − n) = o.

Yet his first duty is to the force nearest andmost potent; e.g. he may rise to greet a friend.This is the third practice of Ethics (ccxx. I. 41).10. Let the Aspirant exercise his will without the least consideration for anyother being.

Let the Aspirant yearn toward Nuit under the stars of Night, with a lovedirected by his Magical Will, not merely proceeding from the heart.This is the first practice of Magick Art (ccxx. I. 57).14. The Result of this Practice in the subsequent life of the Aspirant is tofill him with unimaginable joys: to give him certainty concerning the nature ofthe phenomenon called death; to give him peace unalterable, rest, and ecstasy.This is the second Indication of the Nature of the Result (ccxx.

Let the Aspirant prepare a Pantacle, as follows.Inscribe a circle within a Pentagram, upon a ground square or of such otherconvenient shape as he may choose.

I. 60).17. Let the Aspirant find a lonely place, if possible a place in the Desert ofSand, or if not, a place unfrequented, and without objects to disturb the view.Such are moorlands, fens, the open sea, broad rivers, and open fields. Also, andespecially, the summits of mountains.There let him invoke the Goddess as he hath Wisdom and Understanding so to do.But let this Invocation be that of a pure heart, i.e. a heart wholly devoted toHer, and let him remember that it is Hadit Himself in the most secret placethereof that invoketh. Then let this serpent Hadit burst into flame.This is the fourth practice of Magick Art (ccxx. I. 61.18.

Thus having understood the nature of this Third Indication, let him in hisMagick Rite fall from himself into Nuit, or expand into Her, as his imaginationmay compel him.And at that moment, desiring earnestly the Kiss of Nuit, let him give oneparticle of dust, i.e. let Hadit give himself up utterly to Her.This is the fifth practice of Magick Art (ccxx.

Born inPhiladelphia in 1857, she became an occult scholar around the age of thirty,taking classes at the Theosophical Society and studying various occult subjects.She also taught correspondence courses to women and newlyweds on the importanceof viewing sex as a sacred act, and much of her knowledge of the marriage bedcame to her from her nightly visit with her angelic husband Soph. She wrote theessay Heavenly Bridegrooms on this topic.In 1902 Craddock was arrested under New York's anti-obscenity laws. Shecommitted suicide rather than face life in an asylum. As Vere Chappell writes inhis book Sexual Outlaw, Erotic Mystic: The Essential Ida Craddock:Although it attracted little attention in the mainstream press, HeavenlyBridegrooms did catch the eye of the famed British occultist Aleister Crowley.Crowley had been introduced via correspondence to Theodore Schroeder through theAmerican poet Harry Kemp.1 [part0014.html#c11-aft1] When Crowley came to Americain 1914, one of the first things he did was to write Schroeder and arrange ameeting. Crowley wanted Schroeder to organize public lectures for him inAmerica, and Schroeder was interested in Crowley's writings on sex and religion.Crowley eventually sold him a copy of his Bagh-i-muattar: The Scented Garden ofAbdullah the Satirist of Shiraz (1910), and even offered Schroeder access toproprietary O.T.O. documents on sexual mysticism if he would agree to join theOrder and swear not to reveal its secrets. Schroeder never took him up on theoffer.It was through Schroeder that Crowley became acquainted with the ideas of IdaCraddock, with whom he was unabashedly impressed. He wrote a glowing review ofHeavenly Bridegrooms for his occult periodical The Equinox. It is significantthat he signed the review as “Baphomet,” using his name as head of the O.T.O. inthe English-speaking world, thus implicitly affirming the relevance ofCraddock's work to the O.T.O.'s mysteries. (Crowley regularly wrote reviews inThe Equinox under several different names, depending on the subject matter.) Oneof his most famous quotes also came from this review: “When you have proved thatGod is merely a name for the sex instinct, it appears to me not far to theperception that the sex instinct is God.”Crowley also took issue with the skepticism expressed by Schroeder in hisintroduction to the book, seeing no reason not to take Ida's claims at facevalue rather than assuming they were hallucinations. After all, Crowley was apracticing occultist who knew very well the power of the subconscious mind tocommunicate through visions and other mystical states. In one of his books ofmagical instruction, he wrote: “In this book it is spoken of the Sephiroth andthe Paths; of Spirits and Conjurations; of Gods, Spheres, Planes, and many otherthings which may or may not exist. It is immaterial whether these exist or not.By doing certain things certain results will follow; students are most earnestlywarned against attributing objective reality or philosophic validity to any ofthem.”2 [part0014.html#c11-aft2] In other words, whether or not the existence ofa spirit guide or Borderland husband can be proven objectively, the importantmeasure is the value of the experience to the mystic. In Ida Craddock's case, itis hoped that this book has provided sufficient basis for the reader to judge.HEAVENLY BRIDEGROOMS. By THEODORE SCHROEDER and IDA C——. Reprinted from theAlienist and Neurologist.THIS book has been left entirely unedited by Mr. Theodore Schroeder, with theexception of a very brief explanatory note. I may say that it is one of the mostremarkable human documents ever produced, and it should certainly find a regularpublisher in book form. The authoress of the MS. claims that she was the wife ofan angel. She expounds at the greatest length the philosophy connected with thisthesis. Her learning is enormous. She finds traces of similar beliefs in everycountry in the world, and (having a similar experience of her own) she canhardly be blamed for arguing that one thing confirms the other. Mr. Schroeder isquite logical in calling her paper An Unintentional Contribution to theErotogenetic Interpretation of Religion, but commits the errors of petitioprincipii and non distributio medii with the most exquisite nonchalance. Only alawyer could be so shameless. He begs the question with regard to thisparticular case, assuming that her relation with the angel was purehallucination, of which he has no evidence whatever. He argues that, since oneperson both loves and is religious, religion is nothing but a morbidmanifestation of the sexual instinct. One does not have even to disagree withhim to see how worthless is his reasoning. As a matter of fact, I do half agreewith him in my calmer moments in a general way, but the conclusion can becarried a step further. When you have proved that God is merely a name for thesex instinct, it appears to me not far to the perception that the sex instinctis God.This particular MS. is absolutely sane in every line. The fact that the womancommitted suicide twelve or fifteen years afterwards is no more against thesanity of the MS. than the suicide of Socrates proves that the Republic ismerely the lucubration of a lunatic. I am very far from agreeing with all thatthis most talented woman sets forth in her paper, but she certainly obtainedinitiated knowledge of extraordinary depth. She seems to have had access tocertain most concealed sanctuaries. I should personally be inclined to attributeher suicide rather to the vengeance of the guardians of those palaces than toany more obvious cause. She has put down statements in plain English which arepositively staggering. This book is of incalculable value to every student ofoccult matters.

More thancostumes and play-acting with magical intent, dramatic rituals serve a highpurpose in working magick. As Crowley wrote in Magick in Theory and Practice,“The object of them is almost invariably the invocation of a God, and that Godconceived in a more or less material and personal fashion. These Rituals aretherefore well suited for such persons as are capable of understanding thespirit of Magick as opposed to the letter.”The Best of the Equinox, Dramatic Rituals is a treasure chest of ritualssuitable for performance by the solitary practitioner, as well as small andlarge groups of magicians and initiates. Used with skill, dramatic ritual cantrigger profound consciousness-expanding and self-transformational experiences.From the introduction:In October and November of 1910 E.V. Crowley, with the assistance of Waddell,Neuburg, and a handful of disciples, publicly presented a series of dramaticrituals entititled THE RITES OF ELEUSIS. They were performed on sevenconsecutive Wednesday nights at Caxton Hall, Westminster. London had never seenanything quite like it before. The title notwithstanding, these rituals were notattempts to reenact the ancient ceremonies of the Eleusinian mysteries. In fact,the only thing Crowley's Rites of Eleusis had in common with their namesake wasthe simple fact that they (like their original ceremonies) were written andperformed in order to evoke a specific variety of ecstasy in the particpants andthe audience.From the “Rite of Luna”:THE RITES OF ELEUSISWhether a snake or a sunIn his horoscope Heaven hath cast,It is nothing; every oneShall win to the moon at last.The mage has wrought by his artA billion shapes in the sun.Look through to the heart of his heart,And the many are shapes of one!An end to the art of the mage,And the cold grey blank of the prison!An end to the adamant age!The ambrosial moon is arisen.I have bought a lily-white goatFor the price of a crown of thorns,A collar of gold for its throat,A scarlet bow for its horns;I have bought a lark in the liftFor the price of a butt of sherry:With these, and God for a gift,It needs no wine to be merry!I have bought for a wafer of breadA garden of poppies and clover;For a water bitter and dead,A foam of fire flowing over.From the Lamb and his prison fareAnd the Owl's blind stupor, arise!Be ye wise, and strong, and fair,And the nectar afloat in your eyes!Arise, O ambrosial moon,By the strong immemorial spell,By the subtle veridical runeThat is mighty in heaven and hell!Drip thy mystical dewsOn the tongues of the tender fauns,In the shade of initiate yews,Remote from the desert dawns!"},{"pageContent":"TO OUR READERSWeiser Books, an imprint of Red Wheel/Weiser, publishes books across the entirespectrum of occult, esoteric, speculative, and New Age subjects.
