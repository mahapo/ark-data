Looking back Irealize how very lucky I was to come of age in an environment where the air wasfresh, and the water (at least in those years) as pure as any place on earth. Atthe time, however, I didn't consider myself lucky at all; in fact, I felttrapped like a wild animal in a zoological garden run by well-meaning buttotally inept, insensitive, (and perhaps even dangerous) zookeepers. I waspainfully isolated and felt as if I were the only person in town that engaged inany form of self-examination.I never really fit in with my peers. I refused to join my classmates as theyjoyously rode their bicycles through the fog of the DDT spray truck killingsummertime mosquitoes; I rejected the ridiculous explanations of God, creation,and my own existence proffered with unquestioning conviction by my Sunday schoolteachers. Television would be my only link to the outside world— a world ofcomedy and wit, art and music, ideas and drama.Thank “God” there was a movie theatre in town because the cinema transported meto an adult world of beautiful women and handsome men, and heroes andvillains—adventures of the soul acted out in faraway places and times past andfuture. The theatre was for me holy ground. It was my temple, my church, myuniversity. Each Saturday and Sunday I worshipped at the altar of the silverscreen. Movies delivered everything the church was supposed to deliver. Theyliberated, then elevated my consciousness; fired my imagination, ignited mylibido, and brought me body and soul into the living presence of the gods.I yearned to be on the stage, and as I grew older auditioned for every school,church, and community production, play, and musical that presented itself.Contrary to what you might think, drama did not present an opportunity for me toescape or “get out” of myself but a chance to, for a few moments, “be” myself.As an adult, I would learn that there is real magical method to the Dionysianmadness of dramatic ritual. Indeed, every magical ritual is a sacred drama,complete with all the colorful elements that contribute to the power of greattheatre: costumes, weapons, conflict, and most of all... love.Aleister Crowley was certainly not the first magician to recognize and exploitthe power and potential of magical theatre, but he was arguably the mostaudacious in his attempts to squarely lay it undisguised in the lap of popularculture. The 1910 public performances of his Rites of Eleusis was a watershedmoment in his magical career. These seven planetary ritual dramas deservedlyform the centerpiece of this Volume II of The Best of the Equinox series.Indeed, these rituals could stand alone as a valuable handbook to the modernmagician. In this book, however, the reader will also be treated to a wealth ofadditional collateral material and images gleaned not only from Equinox Vol. I,including rare photos and sheet music from the original productions; the essays,such as The Earth; and J.F.C. Fuller's masterpiece, The Treasure House ofImages; but also the introductory essay, The Rites of Eleusis: Their Origin andMeaning from Equinox Vol. III. To introduce it all we've also included Crowley'swords about Dramatic Ritual from his magnum opus, Magick, Book IV.In my book, The Magick of Aleister Crowley1 [part0005.xhtml#af1] I devote achapter to Crowley's Rites of Eleusis which are seven dramatic ritualsoriginally published in 1911 as the Special Supplement to The Equinox, Vol. I,No. VI. Space allowed me only to include a full version of one of thoseremarkable Rites. I am delighted at the opportunity to now present to you allseven rites as they originally appeared in The Equinox. I append my introductionbelow.It is then, with the greatest of pride, pleasure, and magical excitement that Inow signal to the stage hands to draw up the curtain on The Best of the Equinox,Vol. II, Dramatic Ritual.THE RITES OF ELEUSIS2 [part0005.xhtml#af2]Drama is also magick—in fact, it is the oldest form of magick. We see elementsof prehistoric dramatic ritual painted on the walls of caves and scratched uponthe bones of extinct animals. The tragedies and comedies of the ancient Greekswere written to be entertaining and thought provoking but first and foremostthey were religious observances (celebrated in the temple of Dionysus). We maynot think of them as such, but the stage, the screen, even the television aremagical temples. As we watch and listen, we become living Triangles ofEvocation. Laughter, tears, and terror are literally evoked into us by themagick of the play or film.The magical potential of drama was not lost on our ancestors. Knowing that onlyrelatively few individuals of every generation are emotionally andintellectually equipped to master the natural and spiritual sciences, thehierophants of the past discovered that it was yet possible to bring asignificant level of enlightenment to the masses. It was very important, forinstance, for the working population of ancient agrarian cultures to know thebest times to plant and cultivate their crops. However, for most of the laborforce it really wasn't important (or even helpful) to understand the chain ofastronomical events that affect the change of seasons.It was far easier (and on one level more truthful) to personify the forces andfacts of nature as gods, and then make those gods characters in a simple andunforgettable story or play. In the case of an agricultural drama the storymight simply be intended to reveal the lesson that it is best to plant in theearly spring rather than in the autumn.A greater spiritual potential of dramatic ritual lies in the fact that asindividuals each of us can actually become the main character in the sacreddrama. This is the method of initiation practiced by mystery schools of the pastand initiatory societies of today. The ancient mystery schools were not so muchschools of instruction, rather they were schools of experiences—dramaticexperiences skillfully designed to induce profound changes in consciousness to alarge number of individuals.Tradition informs us that the technique of the mystery schools achieved itshighest level of perfection in Greece. From ca. 2000 BC to nearly three hundredyears into the Christian era the agricultural mysteries of Demeter andPersephone were celebrated within the walled citadel at Eleusis. So strict werethe oaths of secrecy imposed upon initiates that we are still not entirelycertain what went on at the ceremonies3 [part0005.xhtml#af3] themselves. We knowfrom indirect sources that once the initiatory cycles began with a purifyingbath in the sea at Athens followed by a ceremonial march from Athens to Eleusis.The secret activities took place over a span of days and included sacred foodand drink, music, dance, plays and vignettes.Most of the events were performed before a large assembly of the participants.The climactic conclusion, however, was conferred privately, one candidate at atime. Modern scholars point to evidence that prior to this sublime moment thecandidate most probably was given a psychedelic substance to eat or drink.Whatever their technique, the hierophants of Eleusis succeeded for over twothousand years in affecting profound changes in the consciousness of countlessthousands of individuals—individuals who after their initiatory experienceproclaimed with the greatest conviction that they would never fear death again.THE RITE OF ARTEMISOne might think that the awe-inspiring ceremonies that took place in thecavernous Temple of Demeter at Eleusis would have little in common with thegenteel after-dinner parlor diversions of Edwardian London, but that isprecisely the venue where the idea for Crowley's Rites of Eleusis was conceived.On a chilly evening in the spring of 1910 E.V., to entertain their host (orperhaps merely to sing for their supper), Crowley and his lover/disciple MissLeila Waddell engaged in curious battle that pitted poetry against music. First,Crowley recited a poem he felt would put everyone in an exalted frame of mind.Then he challenged Waddell, a consummate violin virtuoso, to complement andmagnify the mood with a piece of music.The exchanges soon became wildly intense and rapturous. After only a few volleyseveryone in the room found themselves raised to a tangible level of ecstasy.Before the bliss of the moment subsided Crowley realized he had discovered thebasic formula of the Eleusinian technique. Moreover, he now had a vehicle tointroduce Scientific Illumination and the Magick of Thelema to a wider audience.He immediately set to work to create an ecstasy-inducing dramatic ritual that hewould stage publicly.The Rite of Artemis4 [part0005.xhtml#af4] was presented for the public andmembers of the press on the evening of August 23, 1910 E.V. at the office of TheEquinox in London. The element of dance was added to the combination of poetryand music in the person of Victor Neuburg who, aside from being one of thegreatest poets of his generation, possessed the thrilling ability to dance withbacchanalic abandon until he collapsed unconscious upon the floor. It was veryimpressive.Another addition to the artistic mix was the introduction of the Cup of Libationthat was offered to the audience several times during the ceremony to betterfacilitate the rush of ecstasy. The content of the cup was most likely a potentmixture of herbs, alcohol, fruit-juice, and mescal buttons (at the timeperfectly legal). Predictably, everyone felt the ecstasy.The reaction was remarkably positive. The next day Raymond Radclyffe wrote inthe August 24th issue of The Sketch magazine:“...beautifully conceived and beautifully carried out. If there is any higherform of artistic expression than great verse and great music, I have yet tolearn it. I do not pretend to understand the ritual that runs like a thread ofmagic through these meetings of the AA Image [../Images/image00134.jpeg] I donot even know what the AA Image [../Images/image00134.jpeg] is. But I do knowthat the whole ceremony was impressive, artistic, and produced in those presentsuch a feeling as Crowley must have had when he wrote:So shalt thou conquer Space, and lastly climbThe walls of Time;And by the golden path the great have trodReach up to God!”No one was more ecstatic than Crowley. He was on the road to becoming a magicalimpresario.CROWLEY'S RITES OF ELEUSISIn October and November of 1910 E.V. Crowley, with the assistance Waddell,Nueburg, and a handful of disciples, publicly presented a series of dramaticrituals entitled THE RITES OF ELEUSIS. They were performed on seven consecutiveWednesday nights at Caxton Hall, Westminster. London had never seen anythingquite like it before. The title notwithstanding, these rituals were not attemptsto reenact the ancient ceremonies of the Eleusinian mysteries. In fact, the onlything Crowley's Rites of Eleusis had in common with their namesake was thesimple fact that they (like the original ceremonies) were written and performedin order to evoke a specific variety of ecstasy in the participants and theaudience.Ambitiously, Crowley chose for his format the seven planets of the ancients, andhe arranged the seven ceremonies according to how the planetary spheres(Sephiroth) appear on the Tree of Life. Starting at the top, the third Sephirah,Binah, is the sphere of Saturn and the highest planetary sphere. As we descendthe Tree the order of the planetary spheres are Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sol,Venus, Mercury, and Luna. This is the sequence of the seven Rites of Eleusis.They are actually seven acts to one master drama, the story of the descent ofspirit (deity) into matter (humanity), and the secret to our return to Godhead.Because the Rites demonstrate a descent down the Tree of Life, each ceremony isnot so much the story of the planetary god's exaltation but rather it is thestory of its decline and fall. (Luna, the final Rite, also hints at how it allstarts over again.) The Rite of Saturn gets the ball rolling by the suicide ofthe Saturnian hero at the end of the play. The next Rite, Jupiter, starts outwith the declaration; “Be silent and secret! For it is by stealth that we arehere assembled. Know that Saturn hath been deceived, having swallowed a blackstone, thinking it to be his son, the child Jupiter. But Jupiter is hereenthroned, and shall overthrow his father. Beware then lest ye breaksilence—until Jupiter be read to make war!” The war, of course, will need theenergy of Mars, the next Rite in sequence, etc.The following analysis was written by Crowley and was part of the booklet5[part0005.xhtml#af5] provided to the attendees of the Rites.Let us add a short analysis of the present series of rites; they may be taken asillustrating Humanity, its fate both good and evil.Man, unable to solve the Riddle of Existence, takes counsel of Saturn, extremeold age. Such answer as he can get is one word. “Despair.”Is there more hope in the dignity and wisdom of Jupiter? No; for the noblesenior lacks the vigour of Mars the warrior. Counsel is in vain withoutdetermination to carry it out.Mars, invoked, is indeed capable of victory: but he has already lost thecontrolled wisdom of age; in the moment of conquest he wastes the fruits of it,in the arms of luxury.It is through this weakness that the perfected man, the Sun, is of dual nature,and his evil twin slays him in his glory. So the triumphant Lord of Heaven, thebeloved of Apollo and the Muses is brought down into the dust, and who shallmourn him but his Mother Nature, Venus, the lady of love and sorrow? Well is itif she bears within her the Secret of Resurrection!But Mercury, too, is found wanting. Not in him alone is the secret cure for allthe woe of the human race. Swift as ever, he passes, and gives place to theyoungest of the Gods, to the Virginal Moon.Behold her, Madonna-like, throned and crowned, veiled, silent awaiting thepromise of the Future.She is Isis and Mary, Istar and Bhavani, Artemis and Diana.But Artemis is still barren of hope until the spirit of the Infinite All, greatPan, tears asunder the veil and displays the hope of humanity, the Crowned Childof the Future. All this is symbolized in the holy rites which we have recoveredfrom the darkness of history, and now in the fullness of time disclose that theworld may be redeemed.In the late 1970s, under the sponsorship of several local O.T.O.6[part0005.xhtml#af6] bodies in Northern and Southern California, The Rites ofEleusis were resurrected and again presented. They were an instant hit. Today,largely through the efforts of O.T.O. bodies, the seven Rites are performed eachyear in numerous locations all over the world. They are extraordinarily“producible.” Each rite requires only a handful of cast members and very limitedprops and costumes. They are as easily staged in a living room or a backyard asthey are in a theatre, hall or desert or mountain venue.If I sound enthusiastic about Crowley's Rites of Eleusis—I am. In the last 25years Constance and I have had the pleasure of staging the entire series anumber of times and have participated in other group productions as well. Wediscovered first hand that these little collections of poetry, music and danceare more than plays with a magical theme. In the purest tradition of theEleusinian mysteries, they are really initiatory experiences in which both castand audience are treated to a highly personalize change of consciousness.It is my hope that you experience some of the rapture and ecstasy of truedramatic ritual within these pages. I especially recommend that you read thepoetry sections out loud.Love,Lon Milo DuQuetteCosta Mesa, CA 20121 [part0005.xhtml#f1] Lon Milo DuQuette.

The object of them isalmost invariably7 [part0006.xhtml#af7] the invocation of a God, and that God isconceived in a more or less material and personal fashion. These rituals aretherefore well sited for such persons as are capable of understanding the spiritof Magick as opposed to the letter. One of the great advantages of them is thata large number of persons may take part, so that there is consequently moreforce available; but it is important that they should all be in harmony. It iswell therefore that they should all be initiates of the same mysteries, bound bythe same oaths, and filled with the same aspirations. But they should not befriends unless by accident. They should be associated only for this purpose.Such a company being prepared, the story of the God should be dramatized by awell-skilled poet accustomed to this form of composition. Lengthy speeches andinvocations should be avoided, but action should be very full. Such ceremoniesshould be carefully rehearsed; but in rehearsals care should be taken to omitthe climax, which should be studied by the principle character in private. Theplay should be so arranged that this climax depends on him alone. By this meansone prevents the ceremony from becoming mechanical or hackneyed, and the elementof surprise assists the lesser characters to get out of themselves at suprememoment. Following the climax there should always be an unrehearsed ceremony, animpromptu. The most satisfactory form of this is the dance. In such ceremoniesappropriate libations may be freely used.“The Rite of Luna”8 [part0006.xhtml#af8] is a good example of this use. Here theclimax is the music of the Goddess, the assistants remaining in silent ecstasy.In “The Rite of Jupiter” the impromptu is the dance, in that of Saturn longperiods of silence.It will be noticed that in these rites poetry and music were largelyemployed—mostly already-published pieces by well-known authors and composers. Itwould be better9 [part0006.xhtml#af9] to write and compose specially forceremony.10 [part0006.xhtml#af10]Image [../Images/image00135.jpeg]“ . . . the veil slowly parts, and MAGISTER TEMPLI is seen standing in theshrine.” From the Rite of Saturn. Caxton Hall Westminster, October 1910.Aleister Crowley as MAGISTER TEMPLI. Leila Waddell to his left, kneeling.7 [part0006.xhtml#f7] The word is unwarrantably universal. It would not beimpractical to adopt this method to such operations as Talismanic Magick. Forexample, one might consecrate and charge a Pantacle by a commemoration of theEquinox of Gods, and the communication by Aiwaz to the Scribe of The Book of theLaw, the Magician representing the Angel, the Pantacle being the Book, and theperson on whom the Pantacle is intended to act taking the part of the Scribe.8 [part0006.xhtml#f8] [In “Liber 850, The Rites of Eleusis,” supplement to] TheEquinox I(6).9 [part0006.xhtml#f9] “PERHAPS! One can think of certain Awful Consequences.”“But, after all, they wouldn't seem so to the authors!” “But—pity the poorGods!” “Bother the Gods!”10 [part0006.xhtml#f10] A body of skilled Magicians accustomed to work inconcert may be competent to conduct impromptu orgia. To cite an actual instancein recent times: the blood of a Christian being required for some purpose, ayoung cock was procured and baptised into the Roman Catholic Church by a manwho, being the son of an ordained Priest, was magically an incarnation of theBeing of that Priest, and therefore congenitally possessed of the powers theretoappurtenant. 237 The cock, “Peter Paul,” was consequently a baptised Christianfor all magical purposes. Order was then taken to imprison the bird; which done,the Magicians assuming respectively the characters of Herod, Herodias, Salome,and the Executioner, action out the scene of the dance, and the beheading, onthe lines of Oscar Wilde's drama, “Peter Paul” being cast for the part of Johnthe Baptist. This ceremony was devised and done on the spur of the moment, andits spontaneity and simplicity were presumably potent factors in its success.On the point of theology, I doubt whether Dom Gorenflot successfully avoidedeating meat in Lent by baptising the pullet a carp. For as the sacrament—by itsintention, despite its defects of form—could fail of efficacy, the pullet musthave become a Christian, and therefore a human being. Carp was therefore onlyits baptized name—cf. Polycarp—and Dom Gorenflot ate human flesh in Lent, sothat, for all he became a bishop, he is damned."},{"pageContent":"SPECIAL SUPPLEMENTNOTEThe Rites were written and produced byALEISTER CROWLEYexcept parts of the Rites of Mars and of Mercury which were written by an adeptwho wishes to remain anonymous.The solos were chosen from her repertoire by Miss Leila Waddell.[In view of the absurd statements as to the character of these rites which havebeen made in certain quarters, it has been thought that the best reply is thepublication of the text in full.

Light did first bedizenEarth with its clusters of fiery dew and spray,When I looked forth and cried, “It is the day!”The stars are dewdrops on my bosom's space;The sun and moon are glances through my lashes,Long, tender rays of night; my subtle faceBurns through the sky-dusk, lightens, fills, and flashesWith solemn joy and laughter of love; the graceOf all my body swaying stoops and dashesSwift to the daisy's dawn of love: and swiftest,O spirit of man, when unto me thou liftest!Dawn shakes the molten fire of my delightFrom the fine flower and fragrance of my tresses!Sunset bids darken all my body's light,Mixing its music with the sad caressesOf the whole world: I wheel in wingless flightThrough lampless space, the starless wildernesses!Beyond the universal bounds that roll,There is the shrine and image of my soul.I am Nature and God : I reign, I am, alone.None other may abide apart: they perish,Drawn into me, into my being grown.None other bosom is, to bear, to nourish,To be: the heart of all beneath my zoneOf blue and gold is scarlet-bright to cherishMy own life's being, that is, and is not other;For I am God and Nature and thy Mother.I am the thousand-breasted milky spouse,Virginal also : Tartarus and GaiaTwinned in my womb, and Chaos from my browsShrank back abashed, my sister dark and dire,Mother of Erebus and Night, that ploughsWith starry-sandalled feet the fields of fire;My sister shrank and fell, the infernal gloomChanged to the hot sweet shadow of my womb.I am : that darkness strange and uterineIs shot with dawn and scented with the rose;The deep dim prison-house of corn and wine,Flowers, children, stars, with flame far subtler glowsFormless, all-piercing, death-defying, divine,A sweet frail lamp whose shadow gleams and shows.No darkness, is as light is where its raysCross, interweave, and marry with the day's!I am: the heart that flames from central Me,Seeks out all life, and takes again, to mingleIts passion with my might and majesty,Till the vast floods of the man's being tingleAnd glow, self-lost within my soul and seaOf love, the sun of utter light, and singleKeen many-veinéd heart: our lips and kissesMarry and muse on our immortal blisses.I am: the greatest and the least: the soleAnd separate life of things. The mighty stressesOf worlds are my nerves twitching. Branch and boleOf forests waving in deep wildernessesAre hairs upon my body. Rivers rollTo make one tear in my superb caresses,When on myself myself begets a child,A system of a thousand planets piled!I am: the least, the greatest: the frail lifeOf some small coral-insect still may trembleWith love for me, and call me queen and wife;The shy plant of the water may dissembleIts love beneath the fronds; reply to strifeWith strife, and all its tiny being crumbleUnder my rough and warrior husband-kiss,Whose pain shall burn, and alter, and be bliss!I am: no word beside that solemn oneReigns in sound's kingdom to express my station,Who, clothed and crowned with suns beyond the sun,Bear on the mighty breast of foam Thalassian,Bear on my bosom, jutting plenilune,Maiden, the fadeless Rose of the Creation!The whole flower-life of earth and sky and seaFrom me was born, and shall return to me!I am: for men and beings passionate,For mine own self calm as the river-cleavingLotus-borne lord of Silence: I createOr discreate, both in my bosom heaving:My lightest look is mother of a Fate:My fingers sapphire-ringed with sky are weavingEver new flowers and lawns of life, designedNobler and newer in mine older mind.I am: I am not, but all-changing moveThe worlds evolving in a golden ladder,Spiral or helical, fresh gusts of loveFilling one sphere from the last sphere grown gladder;All gateways leading far to the above.Even as the bright coils of the emerald adderClimb one by one in glory of sunlight, climbMy children to me up the steep of Time.I am: before me all the years are dead,And all the fiery locks of sunrise wovenInto the gold and scarlet of my head:In me all skies and seas are shaken and cloven:All life and light and love about me shed,Begotten in me, in my moving moven,Are as my tears: all worlds that ever swamAs dew of kisses on my lips: I am.[She draws LEO up to her.

It will be as well, therefore, if Imake here a plain statement as to the exact nature of the rites. The ceremoniesdeveloped from very rude beginnings. The first one was in this wise. I happenedto have a few friends in my room in the evening, among them the celebratedAustralian violinist, Miss Leila Waddell. It struck me that we might pass thetime by a sort of artistic dialogue; I read a piece of poetry from one of thegreat classics, and she replied with a piece of music suggested by my reading. Iretorted with another poem; and the evening developed into a regularcontroversy. The others were intensely interested in this strange conflict, andin the silence of the room spiritual enthusiasm took hold of us; so acutely thatwe were all intensely uplifted, to the point in some cases of actual ecstasy, anintoxication of the same kind as that experienced by an assistant at thecelebration of the Mass or the performance of Parsifal, but stronger because ofits naturalness and primitiveness.It was subsequently decided to try and tune everybody up to some definite,prearranged emotion, and we strung together a rough ceremony in honor ofArtemis. This was so successful that it even impressed persons who had alwaysbeen complete sceptics and scoffers. Having been of help in private, weendeavoured to reproduce the effects in public with greater elaboration.HOW TO WRITE RITES RIGHTWith regard to the genesis of the Rites of Eleusis I must explain that they didnot spring fully armed from my brain, Minerva-like. The actual form which myideas took was simply a question of convenience and compromise. It was necessaryto have a series of some sort, and seven seemed to be about the right number, ifwe were going to get them done before people went away for Christmas. I mighthave chosen another sort of deities; but I thought that those associated withthe days of the week would make it easier for everybody, and it certainly madeit very much easier for me, because the correspondences of colour, form, idea,number, and so on of the planets had been so very well worked out. Of the way inwhich the rituals were constructed, I must say a few words. Let us put ourselvesin the position of the dramatist. Take, for example, the first ritual, that ofSaturn. Working on tradition, just as Wagner did when he took the old Norse Sagafor his world drama, we find Saturn as a black, melancholy God, the devourer ofhis children. Ideas of Night, Death, Black hellebore, Lead, Cypress, Tombs,Deadly Nightshade. All these things have a necessary connection with Saturn inthe mind of anyone who has read the classics. The first condition of this riteis, then, to make the temple a kind of symbolic representation of the sphere ofSaturn. So the representative of Saturn wears the Black Robe. The time isdeclared to be midnight (though, as a matter of fact, it is only twenty minutespast eight — this is an ordinary theatrical convention; and masons will think ofcertain analogies in their own “Orgies”). If the brethren are fed, it is “on thecorpses of their children” as Saturn fed on his. If they drink, it is“Pop-pyheads infused in blood” — symbols of sleep and death. Saturn furtherrepresents the earth, the plane of matter, humanity bounded by old age anddeath, humanity blindly groping after illumination and failing to get it.THE TRUTH BEHIND THE VEILIt is, then, the primitive darkness of humanity that is represented in thisritual. Therefore, we have the despairing cry, “There is no God”; and as alogical result the suicide of the high priest, for there cannot be a priestwithout a God. It is the blackness of uttermost despair; and so the ritual ends.It is only in the second rite, the rite of Jupiter, who is etymologically andactually identical with the Hebrew Jehovah, that light breaks. But even in thatrite, when the Supreme Power is declared, He is too exalted for anyone toapproach Him; it is only by the work of the Divine Spirit that He is mademanifest; and this manifestation only takes place in the God-man whom some callIacchus and others Jesus — again an etymological and mystical identity! Thisdoctrine appears to me to differ from the orthodox doctrine of Christianity inone point only; it is not sectarian. I do not require Mr. John M. Robertson totell me that the story of the crucifixion is merely a mystery play adapted fromthe rites of Mithras; the rite being symbolical of a spiritual truth, allnations that possess knowledge of spiritual things will have incorporated it intheir rites under some name or other.THE DEADNESS OF DOGMAIf my interpretation has been erroneous, let me be shown my error, and I willrepent; but no sensible person can maintain for a moment that my interpretationis un-serious or irreverent. And my chief defense — my counter-attack — is thatthe orthodox methods of inculcating the doctrine in question have been so purelydogmatic and dull, that they have lost all vital force. Without art, truthbecomes falsehood. Imagine anyone taking the teachings of the “Blue Bird,” andpounding them into a creed, and writing dull sermons about them! The unfortunatechildren who had to learn them would begin to hate Maeterlinck bitterly. But letthe sublime truths of Christianity be once again “clothed round by sweet art,with the spacious warm heaven of her imminent wings,” and there will be thattrue revival of religious life that everyone is blindly seeking."},{"pageContent":"CONCERNING “BLASPHEMY” IN GENERAL & THE RITES OF ELEUSIS IN PARTICULARPIONEERS, O PIONEERS!Whenever it occurs to anyone to cut a new canal of any kind, he will be welladvised to look out for trouble. If it be the ishthmus of Suez, thesimple-minded engineer is apt to imagine that it is only a question of shiftingso much sand; but before he can as much as strike the first pickaxe into theearth he finds that he is up against all kinds of interests, social, political,financial, and what-not. The same applies to the digging of canals in the humanbrain. When Simpson introduced chloroform, he thought it a matter for thephysician; and found himself attacked from the pulpit. All his arguments proveduseless; and we should probably be without chloroform to-day if some genius hadnot befriended him by discovering that God caused Adam to fall into a deep sleepbefore He removed the rib of which Eve was made.THE ABUSE OF THE GUTTERNowadays a movement has to be very well on the way to success before it isattacked by any responsible people. The first trouble comes from the gutter. Nowthe language of the gutter consists chiefly of meaningless abuse, and theprincipal catch-words, coming as they do from the mouths of men who never openthem without a profane oath or a foul allusion, are those of blasphemy andimmorality. The charge of insanity is frequently added when the new idea is justsufficiently easy to understand a little. There is another reason, too, forthese three particular cries; these are the charges which, if proved, can getthe person into trouble, and at the same time which are in a sense true ofeverybody; for they all refer to a more or less arbitrary standard of normality.The old cry of “heresy” has naturally lost much of its force in a countrynine-tenths of whose population are admittedly heretics; but immorality andinsanity are to-day almost equally meaningless terms. The Censor permits musicalcomedy and forbids Oedipus Rex; and Mr. Bernard Shaw brands the Censor asimmoral for doing so. Most people of the educated classes will probably agreewith him.INSANITY AND BLASPHEMYAs for insanity, it is simply a question of finding a Greek or Latin name forany given act. If I open the window, it is on account of claustrophobia; when Ishut it again, it is an attack of agarophobia.All the professors tell me that every form of emotion has its root in sex, anddescribe my fondness for pictures as if it were a peculiarly unnatural type ofvice. It is even impossible for an architect to build a church spire withoutbeing told that he is reviving the worship of Priapus. Now, the only result ofall this is that all these terms of abuse have become entirely meaningless, saveas defined by law. There is still some meaning in the term “Forger,” as used ingeneral speech; but only because it has not yet occurred to any wiseacre toprove that all his political and religious opponents are forgers. This seems tome a pity. There is, undoubtedly, a forged passage in Tacitus and another inPetronius. Everyone who studies the classics is, therefore, a kind of accomplicein forgery. The charge of blasphemy is in all cases a particularly senselessone. It has been hurled in turn at Socrates, Euripides, Christ, El-Mansur, theBaab, and the Rev. R. J. Campbell.THE MORALITY RED HERRINGLegal Blasphemy is, of course, an entirely different thing. In the recentnotorious case where an agent of the Rationalist Press Association, HarryBoulter by name, was prosecuted, the question proved to be not a theological oneat all. It was really this, “were the neighbours being annoyed?” “was the man'slanguage coarse?” and the Judge and Joseph McCabe agreed that it was. But inmodern times no one has ever been prosecuted in any civilised country forstating philosophic propositions, whatever may be their theological implicatons.We have no longer the Casuists of the Inquisition, who would take the trouble toargue from Bruno's propositions of the immanence of God that, if that were so,the doctrine of the Incarnation was untenable (and therefore he shall beburned). It is only the very narrowest religious sects that trouble to callHerbert Spencer an Atheist. What the man in the street means by Atheist is themilitant Atheist, Bradlaugh or Foote; and it is a singular characteristic of theOdium Theologicum that, instead of arguing soberly concerning the proposition,which those worthies put forward, they always try to drag the red herring ofmorality across the track.Of all the stupid lies that men have ever invented, nothing is much sillier thanthe lie that one who does not believe in God must be equally a disbeliever inmorality. As a matter of fact, in a country which pretends so hard to appeartheistic as England, it requires the most astounding moral courage, a positivegalaxy of virtues, for a man to stand up and say that he does not believe inGod; as Dr. Wace historically remarked, “it ought to be unpleasant for a man tosay that he does not believe in Jesus”; and my dislike to Atheism is principallyfounded on the fact that so many of its exponents are always boring me aboutethics. Some priceless idiot, who, I hope, will finish in the British Museum,remarked in a free-thinking paper the other day, that they need not trouble topull down the churches, “because they will always be so useful for sane andserious discussion of important ethical problems.” Personally, I would rather goback to the times when the preacher preached by the hour-glass.THE POT AND THE KETTLEI have always been very amused, too, in this connection of blasphemy by theperusal of Christian Missionary journals, on which I was largely brought up.They are full from cover to cover of the most scandalous falsehoods aboutheathen gods, and the most senseless insults to them, insults penned by thegrossly ignorant of our religious population. It is only in quite recent yearsthat the English public have discovered that Buddha was not a God, and it wasnot the missionaries that found this out, but scholars of secular attainment. InAmerica, particularly, the most incredible falsehoods are constantly circulatedby the Missionary Societies even about the customs of the Hindoos. To read them,one would suppose that every crocodile in India was fed with babies as the firstreligious duty of every Indian mother; but, of course, it is most terriblywicked for the Hindoo to make fun of the deities of the American. For my part,who have lived half my life in “Christian” countries and half my life in“heathen” countries, I cannot see much to choose between the differentreligions. Their arguments consist, in the end, of passionate assertion, whichis no argument at all.RELIGION AND DRAW-POKERThere is an excellent story—much better known in India than in England—of amissionary, who was explaining to the poor heathen how useless were his gods.“See!” said he, “I insult your idol, he is but of dead stone; he does not avengehimself, or punish me.” “I insult your God,” replied the Hindoo, “he isinvisible; he does not avenge himself, or punish me.” “Ah!” said the missionary,“my God will punish you when you die”; and the poor Hindoo could only find thefollowing pitiable answer: “So, when you die, will my idol punish you.” It wasfrom America, too, that I obtained the first principle of religion; which isthat four to a flush are not as good as one small pair.ORGIES!Still, I suppose it is useless to contest the popular view that anyone whom anyfool chooses to call an Atheist is liable to conduct “orgies.” Now, can anyonetell me what orgies are? No? Then I must reach down the Lexicon. Orgia, onlyused in the plural and connected with Ergon (work), means sacred rites, sacredworship practised by the initiated at the sacred worship of Demeter at Eleusis,and also the rites of Bacchus. It also means any rites, or worship, orsacrifice, of any mysteries without any reference to religion; and Orgaziomeans, therefore, to celebrate Orgies, or ceremonies, or to celebrate any sacredrites. It is really a poor comment upon the celebration of sacred rites that theword should have come to mean something entirely different, as it does to-day.For the man in the street Orgie means a wild revel usually accompanied bydrunkenness. I think it is almost time that someone took the word Orgie as aBattle Cry, and, having shown that the Eucharist is only one kind of orgie torestore the true enthusiasm (which is not of an alcoholic or sexual nature)among the laity; for it is no secret that the falling away of all nations fromreligion, which only a few blind-worms are fatuous enough to deny, is due to thefact that the fire no longer burns in the sacred lamp.Outside a few monasteries there is hardly any church of any sect whose membersreally expect anything to happen to them from attending public worship. If a newSaint Paul were to journey to Damascus, the doctor would be called in and hisheavenly vision diagnosed as epilepsy. If a new Mahomed came from his cave andannounced himself a messenger of God, he would be thought a harmless lunatic.And that is the first stage of a religious propaganda.THE STATIONS OF THE CROSSNow the real messenger of God can always be distinguished in a very simple way.He possesses a mysterious force which enables him to persist, heedless of thesneers and laughter of the populace. It then strikes the wiser people that he isdangerous; and they begin on the blasphemy and immorality tack. In the life ofour Lord, this will be noticed. In the first place, there was just thecontemptuous “he hath a devil,” which was the equivalent of our “he's just acrank,” but when it was found that this crank had adherents, men of force andeloquence like Peter, to say nothing of financial genius like Judas Iscariot,the cry was quickly changed into wild accusations of blasphemy and allegationsof immorality. “He is a friend of publicans and sinners.” A sane Government onlylaughs at these ebullitions; and it is then the task of the Pharisees to proveto the Government that it is to its interest to suppress this dangerous upstart.They may succeed; and though the Government is never for a moment blind to thefact that it is doing an injustice, the new Saviour is crucified. It is thisfinal publicity of crucifixion (for advertisement is just as necessary in oneage as another) that secures the full triumph to him whom his enemies fondlysuppose to be their victim. Such is human blindness, that the messenger himself,his enemies, and the civil power, all of them do exactly the one thing whichwill defeat their ends. The messenger would never succeed at all if it were notthat he is The Messenger, and it really matters very little what steps he maytake to get the message delivered. For all concerned are but pawns in the greatgame played by infinite wisdom and infinite power.ORDERLY, DECOROUS CEREMONIESIt is, therefore, a negligible matter, this abuse, from whatever source itcomes. It should waste my time if I were to prove that the rites of Eleusis, asnow being performed at Caxton Hall, are orderly, decorous ceremonies. It is truethat at times darkness prevails; so it does in some of Wagner's operas and incertain ceremonies of a mystical character which will occur to the minds of alarge section of my male readers. There are, moreover, periods of profoundsilence, and I can quite understand that in such an age of talk as this, thatseems a very suspicious circumstance!Image [../Images/image00138.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"THE INTERPRETERMother of Light, and the Gods!

I kneel down and hold the grass of the black earth to my bosom; I crushthe earth to my lips as if it were a grape. And the wine of Demeter flushes mycheeks; they burn with joy of youth.Why should I greet the world? Because my heart is bursting with love for theworld. Love, say I? Why not lust? Is not lust strength, and merriment, and thefamine that only the infinite can stay?And why do I call myself the child of miracle? Because I have entered a secondtime into my mother's womb and am born. Because to the knowledge of manhood hascome the passion, even the folly, of adolescence; with all its pride and purity.It is for this that you see me lying upon the thick wet grass, unquenchable; orrejoicing in the fat black loam.Now the manner of the miracle was this.

Through this his vision fades; even his hungerdies away unless he be indeed Elect. But in the end it may be that God shallsend him the other half of that Token of Paradise. Then, if he have kept theholy fire alight, perhaps with much false fuel, that fire shall instant blazeand fill the temple of his soul. By its insistent energy it shall destroy eventhe memory of all those marsh-lights that came to greet it; and the priest shallbow down in the glory, and grasp the altar with his hands, and strike it withhis forehead seven times. Now this altar is the earthen altar of Demeter.Then understanding all things by the light of that love, he shall know that thisis love, that this is the soul of the earth, that this is fertility andunderstanding, the secret of Demeter.

My body is absorbed in scent and touch; for the consuming fire of mysight has burnt itself out to blindness, and in my mouth is only the savour ofan infinite kiss. The moist earth burns my lips; my fingers search down aboutthe roots of the grass. The life of earth itself is my life: I shall be glad tobe buried in the earth. Let my body dissolve into hers, putrefy in her revivinglimbeck. He never loved who let them case him in a coffin from the supremeembrace.It is from the earth, bride of the sun, that all bodily strength derives. It isno figure that Antaeus regained all his force when he touched earth. It is nopedantry and folly of the Hindus, who (fearing bodily lust) isolate theiracolytes from earth, no futility their doctrine of Prana and the Tamo-Guna. Itis not mere faith healing, this hygiene of Father Kneipp, and his failures arethose who retain decorum and melancholy, who follow the letter and not thespirit, coldblooded treaders upon earth instead of passionate lovers of itsstrength.It is no accident of mythology that the Titans made war upon the Gods, and inPrometheus overthrew them.It was when Canute failed to drive back the sea that his dynasty was lost tothat Norman William who caught hold of Mother Earth with both hands.When I was a child I fell; and the scars of the earth are on my forehead at thishour.When I was a boy I was hurt by the explosion of a buried jar of gunpowder; andthe scars of the earth are on my face at this hour.Since then I have been the lover of the earth, that wooed me thus roughly. Manya night have I slept upon her naked breast, in forest and on glacier, upon greatplains and upon lonely crags, in heat and cold, fair weather and foul; and myblood is the blood of the earth. My life is hers, and as she is a spark thrownoff from the whirling brilliance of the sun, so do I know myself to be a sparkof infinite God.Seek earth, and heaven shall be added unto you! Back to our mother, drive theshining spade into her womb! Wrinkle her with your furrows, she will only smilemore kindly!Let your sweat, the sweat of your toil, which is your passion, drip likebenediction from on High upon her; she will render corn and wine. Also your wifeshall be desirable in your eyes all the days of your life, and your childrenshall be strong and comely, and the blessing of the Most High shall be upon you.Then let your grasp relax in the satiety of death, and your weight shall cumberthe earth, and the little children of the earth shall make merry with you untilthe rose strike its root into your breast. Then shall your body be one againwith the Mother, and your soul one with the Father, as it is written in the Bookof the Law.All this have I been taught by her whose purity and strength are even asEarth's, chosen before the foundation of Time. Lioness with lion, may we walk bynight among the ruins of great cities, when, weary with happiness too great evenfor our immortality, we turn from the fragrance and fertility of Earth. And atthe sunrise return where the peopled valleys call us; where, bronzed andbuoyant, our children sing aloud as they drive home the spade.Glory be to the Earth and to the Sun and to the holy body and soul of Man; andglory be to Love and to the Father of Love, the secret Unity of things!Glory be to the Shrine within the Temple, and to the God within the Shrine, tothe Word and to the Silence that bore it unto Him that is beyond the Silence andthe Speech!Also thanksgiving in the Highest for the Gift of all these things, and for themaiden in whom all these things are found, for the holy body and soul of man,and for the sun, and for the earth.

In the Beginning there was Naught, and Naught spake unto Naught saying: Letus beget on the Nakedness of Our Nothingness the Limitless, Eternal, Identical,and United: And without will, intention, thought, word, desire, or deed, it wasso.oo. Then in the depths of Nothingness hovered the Limitless, as a raven in thenight; seeing naught, hearing naught, and understanding naught: neither was itseen, nor heard, nor understood; for as yet Countenance beheld not Countenance.o. And as the Limitless stretched forth its wings, an unextended unextendableLight became; colourless, formless, conditionless, effluent, naked, andessential, as a crystalline dew of creative effulgence; and fluttering as a dovebetwixt Day and Night, it vibrated forth a lustral Crown of Glory.1. And out of the blinding whiteness of the Crown grew an Eye, like unto an eggof an humming-bird cherished on a platter of burnished silver.2. Thus I beheld Thee, O my God, the lid of whose Eye is as the Night of Chaos,and the pupil thereof as the marshalled order of the spheres.3. For, I am but as a blind man, who wandering through the noontide preceivethnot the loveliness of day; and even as he whose eyes are unenlightened beholdethnot the greatness of this world in the depths of a starless night, so am I whoam not able to search the unfathomable depths of Thy Wisdom.4. For what am I that I durst look upon Thy Countenance, purblind one of smallunderstanding that I am, blindly groping through the night of mine ignorancelike unto a little maggot hid in the dark depths of a corrupted corpse?5. Therefore, O my God, fashion me into a five-pointed star of ruby burningbeneath the foundations of Thy Unity, that I may mount the pillar of Thy Glory,and be lost in adoration of the triple Unity of Thy Godhead, I beseech Thee, OThou who art to me as the Finger of Light thrust through the black clouds ofChaos; I beseech Thee, O my God, hearken Thou unto my cry!6. Then, O my God, am I not risen as the sun that eateth up ocean as a goldenlion that feedeth on a blue-grey wolf? So shall I become one with Thy Beauty,worn upon Thy breast as the Centre of a Sixfold Star of ruby and of sapphire.7. Yea, O God, gird Thou me upon Thy thigh as a warrior girdeth his sword! Smitemy acuteness into the earth, and as a sower casteth his seed into the furrows ofthe plough, do Thou beget upon me these adorations of Thy Unity, O My Conqueror!8. And Thou shalt carry me upon Thine hip, O Thou flashing God, as a blackmother of the South Country carrieth her babe. Whence I shall reach my lips toThy pap, and sucking out Thy stars, shed them in these adorations upon theEarth.9. Moreover, O God my God, Thou who hast cloven me with Thine amethystinePhallus, with Thy Phallus adamantine, with Thy Phallus of Gold and Ivory! thusam I cleft in twain as two halves of a child that is split asunder by the swordof the eunuchs, and mine adorations are divided, and one contendeth against hisbrother. Unite Thou me even as a split tree that closeth itself again upon theaxe, that my song of praise unto Thee may be One Song!10. For I am Thy chosen Virgin, O my God! Exalt Thou me unto the throne of theMother, unto the Garden of Supernal Dew, unto the Unutterable Sea!Amen,and Amen of Amen,and Amen of Amen of Amen,and Amen of Amen of Amen of Amen.Image [../Images/image00149.jpeg]1. O Thou snow-clad volcan of scarlet fire, Thou flame-crested pillar of fury!Yea, as I approach Thee, Thou departest from me like unto a wisp of smoke blownforth from the window of my house.2. O Thou summer-land of eternal joy, Thou rapturous garden of flowers! Yea, asI gather Thee, my harvest is but as a drop of dew shimmering in the golden cupof the crocus.3. O Thou throbbing music of life and death, Thou rhythmic harmony of the world!Yea, as I listen to the echo of Thy voice, my rapture is but as the whisper ofthe wings of a butterfly.4. O Thou burning tempest of blinding sand, Thou whirlwind from the depths ofdarkness! Yea, as I struggle through Thee, through Thee, my strength is but as adove's down floating forth on the purple nipples of the storm.5. O Thou crowned giant among great giants, Thou crimson-sworded soldier of war!Yea, as I battle with Thee, Thou masterest me as a lion that slayeth a babe thatis cradled in lilies.6. O Thou shadowy vista of Darkness, Thou cryptic Book of the fir-clad hills!Yea, as I search the key of Thy house I find my hope but as a rushlightsheltered in the hands of a little child.7. O Thou great labour of the Firmament, Thou tempest-tossed roaring of theAires! Yea, as I sink in the depths of Thine affliction, mine anguish is but asthe smile on the lips of a sleeping babe.8. O Thou depths of the Inconceivable, Thou cryptic, unutterable God! Yea, as Iattempt to understand Thee, my wisdom is but as an abacus in the lap of an agedman.9. O Thou transfigured dream of blinding light, Thou beatitude of wonderment!Yea, as I behold Thee, mine understanding is but as the glimpse of a rainbowthrough a storm of blinding snow.10. O Thou steel-girdered mountain of mountains, Thou crested summit of Majesty!Yea, as I climb Thy grandeur, I find I have but surmounted one mote of dustfloating in a beam of Thy Glory.11. O Thou Empress of Light and of Darkness, Thou pourer-forth of the stars ofnight! Yea, as I gaze upon Thy Countenance, mine eyes are as the eyes of a blindman smitten by a torch of burning fire.12. O Thou crimson gladness of the midnight, Thou flamingo North of broodinglight! Yea, as I rise up before Thee, my joy is but as a raindrop smittenthrough by an arrow of the Western Sun.13. O Thou golden Crown of the Universe, Thou diadem of dazzling brightness!Yea, as I burn up before Thee, my light is but as a falling star seen betweenthe purple fingers of the Night.O Glory be unto Thee through all Timeand through all Space: Glory,and Glory upon Glory,Everlastingly. Amen,and Amen, andAmen.Image [../Images/image00150.jpeg]1.

The Light of my Life is as the light of two moons, one rising and the othersetting, one increasing and the other waning; the one growing fat as the othergroweth lean, like a paunchy thief sucking dry a skin of amber wine. Yet thoughthe light of the first devoureth the light of the second, nevertheless the lightof the second disgorgeth the light of the first, so that there is neither thedesire of light nor the need of light—all being as a woven twilight of day andnight, a madness of mingling moons. Yet I behold!11. Now mine eyes are seven, and are as stars about a star; and the lids of mineeyes are fourteen, two to each eye. Also have I seven arms to do the bidding ofthe seven eyes; and each arm hath an hand of three fingers, so that I may rulethe great ocean and burn it up with the Spirit of Flame, and that I may drownthe fire in the Abode of the Waters. Thus I am rendered naked; for neither flamenor water can clothe me; therefore am I as a breath of wind blown over an Earthof Adamant, that knoweth neither sorrow nor rejoicing; then do I abide as aRiver of Light between the Night of Chaos and the Day of Creation.10. Two are the moons of my madness, like the horns on the head of a goat. Andbetween them burneth a pyramid of flame, which consumeth neither but blindethboth, so that the one beholdeth not the other. Notwithstanding, when the one islost in the water, and the other is burnt up in the flame, they become united inthe form of a woman fashioned of Earth and of Air, who without husband is yetmother of many sons.9. Now the Sons are in truth but one Son; and the one Son but a daughter drapedand never naked; for her mother is naked, therefore is she robed. And she iscalled the Light of my Love, for she is concealed and cannot be seen, as the Sunburneth over her and drowneth her in fire, whilst below her surgeth the sea,whose waves are as flames of water. When thou hast licked up the ocean thoushalt not see her because of the fire; and when thou hast swallowed the Sunsurely shall the waters be driven from thee, so that though the fire be thinethe water hath slipped thee, as a dog its leash. Yet the path is straight.8. Along it shalt thou journey, and then shalt thou learn that the fear of deathis the blood of the world. So the woman dressed herself in the shrouds of thedead, and decked herself with the bones of the fallen; and all feared her,therefore they lived. But she feared life; therefore she wove a dew-moon in hertangled hair as a sign of the fickleness of Death, and wept tears of bittersorrow that she should live in the blossom of her youth. And her tears creptlike scorpions down her cheeks, and sped away in the darkness like serpents; andfor each serpent came there an eagle which did carry it away.7. “Why weep?” said the Balance swinging to the left. “Why laugh?” said theBalance swinging to the right. “Why not remain still?” answered the Hand thatheld the Balance. And the Balance replied: “Because on my right laughs Death andon my left weeps a Virgin.”6. Then the voice of the Hand said to the girl: “Why weep?” And the maidanswered: “Because Death maketh jest of my life.” Then the Hand stayed theBalance, and at once the girl saw that she was Death, and that Death that hadsat opposite her was in truth a motherless babe. So she took the child she hadconceived in the arms of fear, and went her way laughing.5. And the infant grew strong; yet its strength was in its weakness; and thoughto look at it from before was to look upon a man-child, from behind it was alittle girl with golden hair. Now, when the child wished to tempt a maid hefaced and approached her; and when the child wished to tempt a man she turnedher back on him and fled.4. But one day the child met, at the self-same hour, Love; and the man, seeing awoman, approached her eagerly, and the woman, seeing a man, fled, so that hemight capture her. Thus it came about that the child met the child and wondered,not knowing that the child had lost the child. So it was that they walked sideby side.3. Then that part of the child that was man loved and lusted for that part ofthe child that was woman; and each knew not that each was the other, and feltthat they were two and yet one, nevertheless one and yet two. And when one said:“Who art thou?” the other answered at the self-same moment: “Who am I?”2. Soon becoming perplexed if I were Thou, or if Thou were I, it came about thatthe I mingled with the Thou, and the Thou with the I, so that six added to tenbecame sixteen, which is felicity; for it is the interplay of the elements. Fourare the elements that make man, and four are the elements that make woman. Thuswas the child reborn.I. But though the man ruleth the woman, and the woman ruleth the man, the Childruleth both its mother and father, and being five is Emperor over the kingdom oftheir hearts. To its father it giveth four, and to its mother it giveth four,yet it remaineth five, for it hath of its father an half and of its mother anhalf; but in itself it is equal to both its father and its mother; for it isfather of fathers and mother of mothers.o. Therefore is it One Whole, and not two halves; and being One is Thirteen,which is called Nothing when it is All-things.Amenwithout lie,and Amen of Amen,and Amen of Amen of Amen.Image [../Images/image00164.jpeg]Image [../Images/image00165.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"ABOUT THE AUTHORALEISTER CROWLEY (1875-1947) poet, mountaineer, secret agent, magus, libertine,and prophet was dubbed by the tabloids “The Wickedest Man in the World”LON MILO DUQUECTE is the author of sixteen critically acclaimed books(translated in twelve languages) on Magick and the Occult.

The subject has something for everyone. Historians, scholars,and Hollywood filmmakers bask in the radiant person of its creator, Dr. JohnDee, a towering figure who, along with being one of the most influentialpolitical advisors to (and spy for) Queen Elizabeth I, developed this complexmagical system in 16th century England. Linguists, such as Dr. Donald Laycock(1936 — 1988) are fascinated with the ‘angelic’ tongue, a true language that wasallegedly ‘delivered’ by angels to Dee and his partner Edward Kelly1 underextraordinary circumstances.But if magick is your cup of tea — nothing compares to the breathtaking eleganceof the Enochian system. My interest in Enochian magick began late in 1979 and Ibegan practicing in earnest in the fall of 1980. It has remained the centerpieceof my magical work ever since. The text I would first use as my instructionmanual was the same collection of documents you will find in the book you arereading at this moment — material that in the late 70s could only be found inthe pages of Aleister Crowley's Equinox, vol. I2, or (in my case) the newlypublished Gems From the Equinox3. There was very little else available at thetime to supplement the Equinox material. Israel Regardie had published certainGolden Dawn papers4 but frankly, at the time, they did more to obfuscate thesubject for me than offer any helpful insight. As difficult as the EquinoxEnochian material appeared to me, I proceeded to tackle it as if it were thefirst and last word on the subject. As my mastery of Enochiana grew, so did myappreciation of Crowley's profound grasp of his subject and what he chose toinclude in the Equinox.There is enough information in the documents herein bound for the student graspthe system, build and understand the various tablets and tools, and immediatelybegin a program of practical Enochian vision magick. However, I stronglyencourage the reader who intends to engage in the practice to become acquaintedwith the several fine texts that have been published in the last 20 years,especially those written or edited by magicians who actually practice the artrather than those who simply write about it. I do not hesitate to point thereader to the online works of Mr. Clay Holden, and the writings of GeoffreyJames, Stephen Skinner, David Rankine, David Jones, Robert Turner, FraterW.I.T., and Joseph H. Peterson.There is a singular shortcoming to the Equinox documents dealing with Enochianmagick. There is little discussion of John Dee and Edward Kelly and thecircumstances of the reception of the original material. My years of practicehave convinced me that awareness of where it all came from is very important. Inmy book, Enochian Vision Magick (Weiser Books: York Beach, ME, 2008),5 I spend agreat deal of time integrating the early Dee and Kelly workings into the theoryand practice of modern Enochian magick. I certainly do not to intend to prefacethis book by reprinting that rather thick volume, but rather, I hope withsheepish and mock humility that the reader who has not already purchased andread Enochian Vision Magick will do so at the earliest possible convenientmoment.In the early 1990s I was asked by Herman Slater of Magickal Childe Publishing towrite an Introduction to his beautifully produced facsimile edition of some ofthe diaries of John Dee that were originally gathered and published in 1659 as ATrue & Faithful Relation of what passed for many Yeers between Dr. John Dee andsome Spirits6 What he wanted was simple enough — a brief introduction to JohnDee — who he was, what he was trying to do with his magick, and how the textssurvived the centuries to be picked up by the adepts of the Golden Dawn in thelate 1800s and then to Aleister Crowley in the first half of the twentiethcentury.I did the best I could (at least for a young man at the beginning of his writingcareer). The print run of this expensively-produced edition was very small andunfortunately never saw a reprint or second edition. These many years later whenI was asked to introduce the Enochian material from the Equinox for this Best ofthe Equinox edition I immediately thought, that even though my old Introductionwas originally written to comment on Dee's diaries, it would nevertheless alsoperfectly set the stage for this work. The publisher has agreed and so I haveincluded it below.Enochian magick isn't for everyone, but I hope whatever your involvement may bewith this most complex and elegant magical art form — whether it is aspractitioner, dabbler, or dilettante, that you will be touched by its beauty andtransformed by its magick.Lon Milo DuQuette1 Alternate spelling, “Kelley” also appears in the original documents.2 The Equinox I (nos. 7 & 8). ed.

Theauditorium of Rhemes College was filled to overflowing with the most learned menof Europe. Passionate young students crowded the eaves and pressed hungry earsto the windows to hear an unprecedented lecture on mathematics.The speaker was an extraordinary young Englishman whose commentaries upon thepropositions of Euclid had stunned and delighted the great minds of theUniversity at Louvain and court of Charles V at Brussels. Not yet thirty yearsold, he was being hailed as the “New Agrippa,” the heir to the greatphilosopher-magicians and the first English “Magus.”His name was John Dee and he was destined to become the ornament of the Age, oneof the most influential figures of Renaissance England — also one of the mostvilified.To adequately profile the life and accomplishments of John Dee would require aseries of tomes the size of the one you are now holding. Yet with very fewexceptions, it has only been recently that biographers have begun to scratch thesurface and explore the incredible details that have been denied to the publicfor over three hundred years.He was mathematician, physician, mechanician, geographer, and chemist. He wastutor to royal families both in England and abroad. His private book collectionat his home in Mortlake was Elizabethan England's great library. He wasengineer, antiquarian, scientist and theologian. No vain dabbler, he was masterof these and a score of other arts and sciences. His inventions andcontributions profoundly affected his world.Why then is he not celebrated with the other luminaries of the Elizabethanperiod? Why has his name fallen through the cracks of the history of WesternCivilization?“Caller of Devils, Arch Conjurer, Necromancer, Invocator of damned Spirits,Sorcerer, Witch, Enchanter, Black Magician”... these were occupations alsoattributed to John Dee. These accusations dogged him throughout his lifetime anddefined his reputation after his death.I will not even attempt to elaborate on the details of this unbelievablyeventful life. I leave that to two most excellent modern biographies:Elizabethan Magic8 by Robert Turner, and especially Peter French's John Dee, TheWorld of an Elizabethan Magus?9 But a brief sketch at this point I think is inorder.John Dee was born on July 13, 1527 to Rowland Dee and Johanna Wild. The family(who could trace their ancestry to Roderick the Great, an early Prince of Wales)was not wealthy but could boast what could be called a middle class income. Hisfather, a gentleman server to Henry VIII, was not without connections at court.In 1542 his father sent him to Cambridge where young Dee budgeted his time toenable him to routinely study eighteen hours a day. Four years later Henry VIIIfounded Trinity College and Dee received a fellowship as an under-reader ofGreek.At Trinity he also delighted in the study of engineering and mechanics and hevolunteered to be a member of the stage crew in the production of the play PAXby Aristophanes. Amusingly, this was where his reputation as a black magicianbegan. His unique mechanical innovations were responsible for seeminglymiraculous stage effects. The illusion of the Scabrous flying up to heaven witha man on its back provoked rumors of supernatural assistance — and indeed, theequipment constructed by Dee to accomplish this illusion incorporated advancedtechnology and invention not taught at Cambridge.In 1547 he took his first trip abroad to consult with the learned men of the dayin the Netherlands. A year later he received his Master of Arts from Cambridgeand enrolled in Louvain. His reputation throughout Europe was startling.Scholars of many countries traveled to confer with him and invitations fromkings and emperors were routinely, but politely, refused.Back in England, however, his reputation as a sorcerer was enhanced when, in1555, the administration of Queen Mary had him imprisoned because of a falseaccusation of Lawde vaynepractices ofcalculing and conjuring to enchant theQueen. He soon extricated himself from this fall from grace, and when Elizabethwas crowned in 1558 Dee was a frequent and welcome visitor at court. He was evengiven the honor of casting the horoscope determining the date and hour of thecoronation ceremony — ironic, as his astrological practice was part of hisproblem with Queen Mary.Elizabeth conferred often with Dee on matters of state, international policiesand most importantly England's adventurous explorations at sea. His knowledge ofgeography, history and science was unequaled and many of the remarkableachievements of the Virgin Queen should be credited to his sage council. Shebecame his patron and protector.This royal protection would be needed for as his reputation as aphilosopher-magus grew so did rumors and accusations of black magic. The vulgarelement saw his odd, eccentric genius as proof he was in league with the devil.His study of Hermeticism (a perfectly natural endeavor for a Renaissancescholar) was viewed by many with suspicion and fear. His house and library atMortlake were ransacked by a mob of neighbors in 1583 while he was on thecontinent, and he was slandered in print as “Doctor Dee the great Conjurer” byProtestant extremist John Foxe. Dee succeeded in halting the slander but thedamage was done.Dee obviously felt that the discretion he exhibited at home in England would beunnecessary on the more enlightened continent. For six years between 1583 and1589 he and skryer Edward Kelley practiced various forms of cabalistic andangelic evocation quite openly.Upon his return to England (at Elizabeth's request) he continued to be harassedand accused. Elizabeth was too distracted with court intrigues to offer muchsupport.Dee's last years were unhappy. The plague claimed his third wife, Jane Fromand,who mothered all eight of his children. His own health failing, he was pressuredby the plots of his fellows, to give up his position as Warden of ManchesterCollege. He returned to Mortlake with his daughter Katherine who was to be hisnurse in the last years.In December of 1608 (or 1609) after King James I ignored Dee's attempt to clearhis name by being tried as a conjurer, Dee died peacefully at Mortlake.Meric Casubon did not intend to immortalize Dr. John Dee when he publishedportions of Dee's magician diaries in 1659. Quite the contrary, it is clear thathe wished to diminish Dee's considerable reputation by perpetuating a portraitof a gullible and spiritually naïve academician whose unwholesome obsession withdreams of communicating with angels led to his social and financial ruin.Titillating the reader with warnings that the material, “... might be deemed andtermed A Work of Darkness,” Casaubon set to work to destroy Dee's reputation.The reason he would spend the time and considerable expense to vilify the memoryof a man considered by many of his contemporaries to be the greatestmathematician and philosopher of his Age, can be discovered in the complex anddangerous intrigues surrounding the social/political/religious upheaval of thePuritan Revolution.Throughout the Civil War and Commonwealth Period (1642-1660) Casaubon remained aloyal and vocal support of the Anglican Church. As a recognized and respectedclassical scholar he was stunned when in 1644, by order of the government, hisposition at Canterbury and accompanying salary was suspended.Disenfranchised, he sought to avenge himself upon the Puritan government byattacking one of the fundamental tenants of the faith: namely, the belief thatindividuals, independent of the offices and inspiration of the Church, couldreceive spiritual guidance directly from divine sources.If Casaubon could demonstrate that even the great Dr. Dee was victim of diabolicdeception, perhaps the spiritual cause célèbre of Calvin and Cromwell might alsobe no less a product of Satanic delusion. As he would hang if he publicly statedthe latter, he chose to attempt to prove the former.The government of the Commonwealth was indeed upset over the publication of ATrue & Faithful Relation of What Passed for many Yeers between Dr. John Dee...and Some Spirits ... (as Casaubon titled the work). However, so many copies wereinitially printed and distributed that all official attempts to suppress itfailed.In the minds of the public, the rumors of Dee's involvement in “Black Magic”were true — confirmed by his own words, in his own diaries. Casaubon hadsucceeded in sacrificing the reputation of Renaissance England's greatestphilosopher-magus upon the altar of vulgar expediency.Nevertheless, we owe Meric Casaubon a profound debt of gratitude; for no matterhow unworthy his motives, his work has served as an ark — a time capsule whichhas preserved one of the most remarkable magical records of all time.THE METHOD OF SCIENCE, THE AIM OF RELIGION10To the modern student of magick, A True and Faithful Relation ... is a treasurewithout equal. We experience almost voyeuristic self consciousness as theintimate nature of the record unfolds. We become eaves-droppers on the detailsof the most remarkable magical event ever recorded.To Dee, magick was science. He took excellent notes; recording each experiencewith the precision of modern scientific notation. He did not wish to talk withAngels so he could bewitch his neighbor's cow or seduce the girl next door. Hesincerely desired more information about the laws of nature and the underlyingprinciples of Creation.Like Henry Cornelius Agrippa and Giordano Bruno, Dee was conscious of the factthat he was perhaps the most learned man of his day. Everything that was knownto Man was known to him. He was the world's foremost authority on a score ofsubjects from geography to mechanics. Where does the man who knows more thananother person on earth turn when he still has questions? The answer is God, ormore accurately, God's messengers to humanity, the Angels who throughoutbiblical literature appeared to pious men to teach the knowledge that was hiddenfrom mortals. The Patriarch Enoch was once such person who found favor in thepresence of God — hence Dee used the word “Enochian” to describe his efforts.From 1582 to 1589 Dee and his “skryer,” Edward Kelly, plunged almost daily intothe black obsidian mirror that was their doorway to the “angelic” world. Despitehis somewhat dubious reputation, Kelly was a gifted clairvoyant. It was obviousfrom the earliest sessions that something extraordinary was taking place. Bothmen seemed genuinely surprised by the success of the initial contacts; theawkwardness of these early sessions is touchingly amusing.Questions concerning world politics and matters of State dominated these firstencounters but as the sessions continued it became clear that the angels had anagenda of their own. Dee and Kelly were informed that the angelic world could bemore easily accessed and communications more efficiently facilitated if themagician actually spoke the language of the angels. The communicating angelsthen proceeded, in the most complex and extraordinary manner, to teach them theangelic language. This event is without parallel in magical history. IsraelRegardie in his massive work, The Complete Golden Dawn System of Magic11 writes:The Enochian Language is not just a haphazard combination and compilation ofdivine and angelic names drawn from the [Enochian] tablets. Apparently, it is atrue language with a grammar and syntax of its own. The invocations are notmerely strings of words and barbarous names, but are sentences which can betranslated in a meaningful way and not merely transliterated.Eighteen invocations, or “Calls,” written in the Angelic language, comprise asystem whereby the magician can access the unseen elemental universe underlyingthe phenomenal world. A nineteenth Call is used to penetrate the spiritual worldknown in the system as the Thirty Aethyrs. These correspond roughly to theascending planes of consciousness of the Qabalistic universe and were exploredby the magician in the same manner as “path workings.It is ironic that Dee and Kelly did not utilize much of the technicalinformation dictated to them. They seemed to be almost entirely absorbed in theprocess of obtaining the data.It would be over three hundred years before the material Dee and Kelly laboredso hard to obtain would be organized into a magical system by Golden Dawngenius, S.L. MacGregor Mathers who recognized the intrinsic value of thesurviving diary material. The records found in A True and Faithful Relation...supplied the bulk of this information.The two major branches of modern practical Enochian Magic (Elemental andAethyrical) were grafted by Mathers into the Adeptus Minor curriculum of theGolden Dawn. In 1898, Aleister Crowley joined the Golden Dawn and in 1900attained the Grade of Adeptus Minor. The passion of his exploration of theEnochian system far exceeded the efforts of his predecessors and in 1909, whilewalking across the North African Sahara, he completed his systematicexplorations of the thirty worlds of the Aethyrs and chronicled them in hismasterpiece, The Vision and the Voice. Hermetic scholars have seriously comparedthis document to the visionary works of William Blake and the prophetic writingsof Ezekiel and Saint John the Divine.7 From the 1992 Magickal Childe Edition.
