There are four suits, as in modernplaying cards, which are derived from it. But the Court cards number fourinstead of three. In addition, there are twenty-two cards called “Trumps,” eachof which is a symbolic picture with a title to itself.At first sight one would suppose this arrangement to be arbitrary, but it isnot. It is necessitated, as will appear later, by the structure of the universe,and in particular the Solar System, as symbolized by the Holy Qabalah. This willbe explained in due course.1 [notes.xhtml#ft1]These are the brilliantly concise opening words of Aleister Crowley's The Bookof Thoth. When I first read them, I was filled with great expectations. At last,I thought, the great mysteries of the Thoth Tarot are going to be explained tome—“in due course.”At the time, I considered myself a serious student of tarot, having spent threeyears studying the marvelous works of Paul Foster Case and his Builders of theAdytum2 [notes.xhtml#ft2] tarot and Qabalah courses. As dictated in the B.O.T.A.curriculum, I painted my own deck of trumps and dutifully followed themeditative exercises outlined for each of the twenty-two cards. Now, withAleister Crowley's Thoth Tarot and The Book of Thoth in hand, I knew I was readyto take the next step toward tarot mastery and my own spiritual illumination.It took a bit of bravado on my part to arrive at this threshold. My firstintroduction to Crowley had not been particularly satisfying. In fact, I camevery close to shunning the Thoth Tarot and The Book of Thoth as seductive worksof the devil. I wrote about this embarrassing episode in my book, My Life withthe Spirits:3 [notes.xhtml#ft3]Eventually, I came upon an early edition of Aleister Crowley's Thoth Tarot deck.I had never seen anything so beautiful in my life. The name Aleister Crowleysounded familiar and I vaguely recalled seeing his name footnoted in a Qabalahbook that I had read by Frater Achad. I referred to my occult dictionary anddiscovered to my horror—“Aleister Crowley—famous Scottish Satanist.”I may have been a wild and crazy heretic, but I sure didn't want anything to dowith Satanism. Knowing my brother owned a copy of The Book of Thoth (thecompanion text), I promptly gave the cards to him. Good riddance!I was soundly disabused of this notion a few days later by our dear friend MadBob (a name that only begins to describe his bizarre and wonderful character),who had returned briefly from a Central American adventure. Bob had readCrowley's autobiography4 [notes.xhtml#ft4] and insisted I would love the man ifI gave him a chance. When I showed him what the occult dictionary had to say, hebrushed it off saying, “It doesn't matter if Crowley was a Satanist, he was agood kind of Satanist. You'll just love him! Trust me.”That was the strangest thing I had ever heard, but I respected Mad Bob's opinionand took the cards back from my brother and asked to borrow his Book of Thoth.Bob was right. Even though I didn't understand most of what I read, I could seethat Aleister Crowley was brilliant, funny, and everything I was looking for. Ibought everything I could by or concerning the man (precious little in thosedays) and eventually wrote to Crowley's Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.) at theaddress published on the Caliph card included in the Thoth Tarot to ask forinitiation.And so began what (for good or ill) I must call my magical career. The ThothTarot being not only the catalyst that triggered my metamorphosis fromdilettante to magician, but also the talisman that obligingly provided themailing address of the Holy Order that would remain my spiritual home anduniversity for the next quarter century.Please don't think that by relating the above story I am suggesting thateveryone who wishes to understand more about the Thoth Tarot or The Book ofThoth need run right out and join the O.T.O. or any other group, magical orotherwise. Occult societies are not for everybody, and no matter what any ofthem may suggest to new or potential members, no organization has yet corneredthe market on the wisdom of the ages. In fact, all the information one will everneed in order to master the subject has already been published and is readilyavailable—more available, in fact, than at any other time in history. At thedawn of the new millennium, it is not a matter of whether or not the answers areout there, rather it is a matter of arriving at a place where one knows theright questions to ask.Naturally, because no two individuals are alike, we should not expect to findthe answers in the same places. For me, the answers most often come, not fromteachers or from mystery school lectures, but from books—books, curiouslyenough, that I have already read (or thought I read) many times before.Crowley's Book of Thoth is one such book. It seems to change miraculously as itrests on the shelf. I can say with certainty that, in the last thirty years, Ihave read it cover-to-cover at least a dozen times, and have referred to ithundreds of times. Yet every time I pick it up, I find something profound that Ihave never seen before. More often than not, this new intelligence is preciselythat bit of information I have been combing my brain or library for, or else itsatisfies some spiritual frustration currently gnawing at my soul.I used to blame this phenomenon on the fact that I am a slow learner and need tohave something drummed into my head many times before I start to “get it.”Nevertheless, over the years, I have spoken to so many students who tell me thatthe same thing happens to them (especially with books by Aleister Crowley) thatI believe it to be a universal experience.Of course, I don't believe that the words on the page actually metamorphose intodifferent words between readings. Nor can I bring myself to think that I amcareless enough to leave unread great chunks of a book I passionately want tounderstand. Rather, I have come to realize that it is me who changes betweenreadings, and that the magical secret to learning more than I now know lies inmy ability to become someone who is more than I now am.For this reason, I strongly recommend that, if you are truly serious about yourstudy of the tarot, you not only read The Book of Thoth but reread it regularly.Leave it off the shelf and refer to it often. Keep rereading it until it fallsapart in your hands, then go out and buy a new one. It will be a different bookevery time you pick it up. It is a magick book. Respect it. Treasure it. Let itwork its magick on you—not so much for the reward of learning more than you nowknow, but for sake of your spiritual destiny to become someone greater than younow are.The idea that I should write an exegetic text on the Thoth Tarot and The Book ofThoth was first suggested by Miss Judith Hawkins-Tillirson5 [notes.xhtml#ft5] atan informal meeting with me, Donald Weiser, and Betty Lundsted of Weiser Books.Judith's proposition came as a complete surprise to me, and I sat speechlessthroughout most of her pitch. She pointed out the fact that, other than The Bookof Thoth itself, there was no book that examined the Thoth Tarot from the pointof view of a Crowley “expert.”She went on for only two or three minutes. When she was finished, she sat backin her chair and grinned at me. Don and Betty agreed that the book was a goodidea and that I should send them some preliminary material. That was that. I hadhardly spoken a word. I went back to my hotel and stared out the window at aglorious Chicago thunderstorm and asked myself, “What in the world have I gottenmyself into?”While the definition of the term “expert” is certainly open to debate, it isprobably at least partially true that my credentials to comment on the subjectare as presentable as anyone's. However, I must warn the reader that myunderstanding of Crowley, Thelema, and tarot is constantly changing. No matterhow smugly secure I may appear in my theories and opinions, please keep in mindthat I am perpetually reexamining my theories and changing my opinions. Icounsel you to be prepared to do the same."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONEimages [images/im.jpg]LITTLE BITS OF THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOWIt seems important that you should understand my motive. To me this Work on theTarot is an Encyclopaedia of all serious “occult” philosophy. It is a standardBook of Reference, which will determine the entire course of mystical andmagical thought for the next 2000 years. My one anxiety is that it should besaved from danger of destruction, by being reproduced in permanent form, anddistributed in as many distant places as may be. I am not anxious to profitfinancially; if I had the capital available in this country, I should send (say)200 copies to State Libraries in all parts of the world, and as many more to myprincipal representatives.6 [notes.xhtml#ft6]—Aleister Crowley to Mr. Pearson, Photoengraver, May 29, 1942.Every year since 1969, when the first color edition appeared in bookstores andspecialty shops worldwide, Aleister Crowley's Thoth Tarot has remained one ofthe best-selling tarot decks in the world. This is not surprising. In myopinion, it is quite simply the most stunningly beautiful deck of tarot cardsever created. It took the artist, the immensely talented Frieda Harris,7[notes.xhtml#ft7] over five years (1938-1943)8 [notes.xhtml#ft8] to complete theseventy-eight surrealistic masterpieces.Today, the images remain as hauntingly evocative as when they were firstexhibited. The popularity of the cards, however, shines in bright contrast tothe black reputation of the man who designed them and who relentlessly dictatedevery aspect of their execution—a man maligned during his lifetime as a blackmagician, and branded by the press “the wickedest man in the world.”Paradoxes seem to define the life and career of Edward Alexander (Aleister)Crowley.9 [notes.xhtml#ft9] Yes, in many ways he was a scoundrel. There is nodoubt that he wallowed shamelessly in his carefully cultivated persona asEngland's literary and spiritual bad-boy. At the same time, he took life andhimself very seriously. Among other distinctions, he was a world-classmountaineer,10 [notes.xhtml#ft10] chess master, painter, poet, sportsman,novelist, critic, and theatrical producer. He introduced America to astrology,11[notes.xhtml#ft11] Isadora Duncan to the I Ching, and the poet Victor Neuberg tohiking and high magick. As an agent provocateur writing for an English-languageGerman propaganda newspaper in New York, he penned the outrageous andinflammatory editorials that provoked a reluctant United States Congress toenter World War I on England's side.12 [notes.xhtml#ft12]During World War II, at the request of friend and Naval Intelligence officer IanFleming,13 [notes.xhtml#ft13] Crowley provided Winston Churchill with valuableinsights into the superstitions and magical mind-set of the leaders of the ThirdReich. He also suggested to the prime minister, if reports can be believed, thathe exploit the enemy's magical paranoia by being photographed as much aspossible giving the two-fingered “V-for-Victory” gesture. This sign is themanual version of the magical sign of Apophis-Typhon, a powerful symbol ofdestruction and annihilationwhich, according to magical tradition, is capable ofdefeating the solar energies represented by the swastika.Astonishingly, Crowley's adventures and achievements—more than any dozen men ofambition and genius could realistically hope to garner in a lifetime—seem almostto be distractions when weighed against his monumental exploits ofself-discovery. His visionary writings and his efforts to synthesize andintegrate the esoteric spiritual systems of East and West14 [notes.xhtml#ft14]make him one of the most fascinating cultural and religious figures of thetwentieth century.Even though his highly esoteric (and often ponderous) writings today enjoy alevel of readership and appreciation never approached during his lifetime, thenumber of aspirants willing to take up serious study of his ScientificIlluminism remains relatively small. For those daring and tenacious students,his Thoth Tarot becomes the cornerstone of their study—a priceless andindispensable treasure. It is nothing less than a full-color visual textbook ofthe wisdom of the ages—a living talisman that distills, in breathtakingpageantry, the essence of the spiritual education and insights of a modernmaster of the ancient mysteries. Is it any wonder that such a rare and radiantmagical device should cast an irresistible spell upon nearly everyone with whomit comes in contact? For me, the answer is obvious. However, I think it is alsofair to ask if it is possible for someone to use and enjoy the Thoth Tarot, evenif they have absolutely no interest in Crowley or the Qabalistic, astrological,and magical aspects of the cards.My answer is an unequivocal “Yes!”The Thoth Tarot happens to be the preferreddeck of thousands of tarot collectors, students, and amateur and professionalreaders all over the world.15 [notes.xhtml#ft15] Most with whom I have spokentell me they choose the deck because of its haunting beauty and its efficacy asa divinatory tool. Those who know something about Crowley and his work areusually polarized in their opinions, but even those who consider him a perfectlydreadful individual still maintain a healthy admiration for the cards. I wasonce assailed by a venerable tarot reader who voiced the opinion shared by manyprofessional readers and fans of the Thoth Tarot: “I don't care who AleisterCrowley was, and I don't believe in his magick. I just know I like those damnedcards and they work!”While it is undoubtedly true that only a small percentage of owners and users ofthe Thoth Tarot will ever fully appreciate the esoteric value of the cards, itis also abundantly clear to me that there are a great many people who wouldsincerely like to know more about them. If you find yourself in this group ofseekers, this book is for you.In recent years, several fine books have been published that use the Thoth Tarotas illustrations. By and large, these books pay respectful attention to the moreobvious features of the cards. They are good tarot books in their own right, butthey do not, in my opinion, deal satisfactorily with the profound concepts andrevelations that make the Thoth Tarot so unique and important. There is,however, one book that does. It is a magnificent work written by the only persontruly qualified to comment authoritatively on the cards. The singularshortcoming of this magnum opus, however, is not that it doesn't tell usenough—but that it tries to tells us everything.Toward the end of his life, Crowley (writing as The Master Therion) wrote one ofhis greatest works, The Book of Thoth—A Short Essay on the Tarot of theEgyptians. 16 [notes.xhtml#ft16] He intended it as an “elementary treatise” ontarot in general and the Thoth Tarot in particular. As anyone who has read it,or attempted to read it, will tell you, it is anything but elementary. In fact,unless one is already extremely knowledgeable in the fields of mythology,philosophy, and religion, unless one is thoroughly steeped in the doctrines ofthe Hebrew Qabalah, unless one is intimately familiar with the immense body ofmagical and visionary work that occupied Crowley for nearly fifty years, unlessone is fluent in the complex and enigmatic nomenclature these visions spawned,The Book of Thoth is most definitely not a user-friendly exposition of the ThothTarot.This is not to say that the uninitiated cannot benefit from reading it. On thecontrary, there is much in the text that is immediately comprehensible, indeed,profoundly inspirational. Nevertheless, if it is the reader's desire to gainsome practical information about the Thoth Tarot quickly, he or she will mostlikely not read past the seventh paragraph:One important interpretation of Tarot is that it is a Notariqon of the HebrewTorah, the Law; also of ThROA, the Gate. Now, by the Yetziratic attributions—seetable at end—this word may be read The Universe—the new-born Sun—Zero. This isthe true Magical Doctrine of Thelema: Zero equals Two. Also, by Gematria, thenumerical value of ThROA is 671 = 61 x 11. Now 61 is AIN, Nothing or Zero; and11 is the number of Magical Expansion; in this way also, therefore, ThROAannounces that same dogma, the only satisfactory philosophical explanation ofthe Cosmos, its origin, mode, and object.17 [notes.xhtml#ft17]Please do not think that I am deriding the content of the above statement. It isremarkably lucid and perfectly Crowley. I understand it (to a degree) and, givenenough time (with breaks for meals), could explain it to any reasonablyintelligent person. However, when I first read it nearly thirty years ago, itmade absolutely no sense to me. I knew nothing about Qabalistic worldsubdivisions, Enochian Aethyrs, or magical societies. I couldn't get through onepage of The Book of Thoth without encountering references to things I knewnothing about and reference books I did not possess.Lady Harris was equally overwhelmed, and voiced her frustration in a January1939 letter to Crowley.In reference to your books—I suppose you know that most of them would be easierfor a beginner written in Sanscrit and that anyone reading them would go offtheir heads. Therefore the wise (like myself) take them in snappy bits and onlywhen they are feeling strong.18 [notes.xhtml#ft18]So it is with much of The Book of Thoth. It is a masterpiece without equal, andthe perfect companion to the Thoth Tarot. While the latter can be appreciatedthe moment the cards are taken out of the box, however, the former demands asignificant investment of time and study.It would be many years before I realized that, had I known only just a littlebit about the magical life of Aleister Crowley, just a little bit about hisrevolutionary spiritual world-view and prophetic visions, just a little bitabout astrology, just a little bit about the Qabalah, just a little bit aboutalchemy, just a little bit about the Golden Dawn and the Tree of Life, then TheBook of Thoth and the Thoth Tarot cards would soon have yielded many of theirmost important mysteries. What I needed was another book—a book that might havebeen titled Little Bits of Things You Should Know before Beginning Your Study ofAleister Crowley's Thoth Tarot.Unfortunately for me, no such book existed at the time. Hopefully, one does now."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWOimages [images/im.jpg]ALEISTER CROWLEY AND THE GOLDEN DAWNBeyond all other mundane events it was the influence of the Hermetic Order ofthe Golden Dawn that shaped Aleister Crowley's life. Once exposed to itsQabalistic system of grades and philosophy, its magical practices and ceremonieshe was never the same.19 [notes.xhtml#ft19]Obviously, for us to begin to understand Aleister Crowley's Thoth Tarot, weshould first know a little bit about Aleister Crowley. Not forgetting my wordsin the previous chapter [chap1.xhtml] concerning the helpfulness of “littlebits” of information, I must confess that, when the subject is Aleister Crowley,a little bit of knowledge can be a very dangerous thing. Those knowing just alittle bit about the man vilified him mercilessly during his life and continueto do so to this day. On the other side of the coin, there are those who knowjust a little bit about Crowley who become instant “true believers.” Theyemulate his every perceived prejudice and vice and zealously worship him as ifhe were an omniscient and unerring god. Both views are dangerously flawed. Makeno mistake about it: a person needs an enormous amount of information in orderto arrive at a fair and reasonable understanding of this complex and remarkablecharacter.Unfortunately, space will not allow us a thorough examination and proper defenseof the seventy-two-year adventure that was the colorful life of AleisterCrowley. For those of you who wish to take a more in-depth look, there are fourbiographies that I do not hesitate to recommend.20 [notes.xhtml#ft20] They areincluded in the bibliography at the end of this volume.Understandably, many of you will not care (or be able) to research these texts,nor should this gap in your Crowley education prevent you from using andenjoying the Thoth Tarot. I truly wish I could break every rule of literarydecorum and simply say something like: Please trust me on this, folks. I know anawful lot about Crowley. He wasn't perfect. In fact, he could be perfectlyhorrible! But despite his outrageous behavior and many shortcomings, hisspiritual quest was as sincere, as genuine, and as successful as any everrecorded. In this respect, he was in a very real sense a holy man. Within themountains of written material he left behind there are priceless treasureswaiting to be discovered by anyone willing to dig for them.Aleister Crowley was born Edward Alexander Crowley on October 12, 1875, atLeamington, Warwickshire, England, to Edward Crowley, a wealthy brewer, andEmily Bertha Bishop. His father was a follower of John Nelson Darby and a laypreacher for the extremely conservative Plymouth Brethren Protestant sect. Hismother was an enthusiastic (Crowley wrote “fanatical”) member of the same.Young Alex was a sickly child and endeavored to overcome his health deficienciesby hiking and rock climbing. He was educated by a number of private tutors andprivate schools, including Malvern College, Tonbridge, Eastbourne College,King's College, London, and finally Trinity College, Cambridge.At Cambridge, he blossomed into a prolific poet and developed a keen interest inalchemy and all things mysterious and occult. In November of1898, he offeredhimself for initiation into the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in London,taking the motto “Perdurabo,” meaning “I shall endure to the end.” This is anallusion to Matthew 10:22, that is chillingly prophetic of the future that laybefore young Crowley: “And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: buthe that endureth to the end shall be saved.”21 [notes.xhtml#ft21]Although he would be instrumental in breaking it up just a few years later, thestructure and teachings of the Golden Dawn would remain a major influencethroughout his life. It would also, quite literally, provide the blueprint forhis personal spiritual evolution. As we will soon see, the Golden Dawn's Equinoxceremony (when the Hierophant steps down and a new one is installed)foreshadowed a most profound cosmic event—but more on that later.In the Golden Dawn's fifth degree (Adeptus Minor), the new initiate is requiredto paint his or her own deck of tarot cards modeled after one loaned to him orher by the Order. The model deck was almost certainly designed by the Order'smaster adept, S.L. MacGregor Mathers, and painted by his artist wife, Moina.For less than a dozen years, this deck had been the most esoteric and secretpack of cards in existence. Candidates were bound by the most solemn andterrible oaths never to reveal the secret correspondences and images. Crowley,as part of his Adeptus Minor duties, most assuredly created his own, and theimages of the Thoth Tarot are based solidly upon those of the Golden Dawn model.Later, when I discuss the individual cards, I will make repeated references tothese original designs.The Golden Dawn degree system is based upon the Qabalistic schema called theTree of Life (see figure 21 [chap9.xhtml#fig21], chapter 9 [chap9.xhtml]). Thisdiagram will become very important to us in our study of the Thoth Tarot and theinitiatory career of its creator. The Tree of Life consists of ten sephiroth,22[notes.xhtml#ft22]—emanations from (or aspects of) the supreme being. These tensephiroth can be considered levels of consciousness—the lowest (10) being thatof the material plane, the highest (1) being the supreme consciousness of deity.In the course of our incarnation adventures, each of us, in one way or another,eventually “climbs” this tree, gaining ever more subtle levels of consciousness,until we finally achieve union with godhead and supreme spiritual liberation.The tarot is a perfect representation of the Tree of Life. The ace of each suitrepresents the top sephira (1) and the two, three, four, five, six, seven,eight, nine, and ten of each suit represents its respective sephira on the Tree.There are also twenty-two paths that connect the ten sephiroth and facilitatethe candidate's climb up the tree. These twenty-two paths are represented intarot by the twenty-two trump cards. We will discuss the Tree of Life in moredetail in chapter 9 [chap9.xhtml]. Here it is only necessary to remember thatthe ten sephiroth and twenty-two paths of the Tree of Life are the keys tounderstanding the magical life and career of Aleister Crowley, as well as thekey to understanding the Thoth Tarot."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREEimages [images/im.jpg]THE LADY AND THE BEASTDon't, Aleister, say “like me a little.” If I may aspire to such a position, youare my friend and when my friends are rude to me I cannot remember it. Theyremain the cone, the eye, the node, from which is generated all the pleasure Ihave in life.23 [notes.xhtml#ft23]—Harris to Crowley, January 28, 1940.Was Frieda Harris a Lady? Of course she was, but the first little bit ofinformation we should learn about her concerns her use of the title “Lady.” Sheis almost always referred to in print as “Lady Frieda Harris.” This is nottechnically correct, however. British book antiquarian and Crowley/Harrisscholar Clive Harper wrote me the following:Percy Harris was made a baronet in 1932 (a baronetcy can be thought of as aninheritable “Sir…” title). He was appointed to the Privy Council in 1940 and sobecame entitled to be called “The Right Honourable…” but strictly speaking thisis an office, rather than an honour. The wife of a baronet is indeed a “Lady”but as the wife of Sir Percy Harris, she should have been known as “LadyHarris.” “Lady Frieda Harris” would only be correct if she was, for example, thedaughter of a duke and so entitled to a courtesy title through her father. Ifshe had divorced her husband she would be properly called, “Frieda, LadyHarris.” Now it is clear that she herself used “Lady Frieda Harris” and shewould certainly have known the protocol for such things. One can but suspectthat she was not averse to letting people assume that she came from a noblefamily, rather than being merely the estranged wife of a baronet.24[notes.xhtml#ft24]There is very little information available concerning the personal relationshipthat existed between Lady Harris and Aleister Crowley. In my mind, it is a storythat perhaps could only have been written by E. M. Forrester and filmed byMerchant Ivory. I can imagine the movie trailer…cue the string quartet!Freethinking London socialite and surrealist painter, Frieda Harris, wife of TheRight Honourable Sir Percy Alfred Harris, M. P. (powerful Chief Whip of theLiberal Parliamentary Party) mysteriously falls under the spell of the notoriousblack magician Aleister Crowley, the most vilified and despised man in England.Ignoring the possible social consequences, she becomes his magical disciple25[notes.xhtml#ft25] and agrees to focus her immense talent on a strange andmonumental task. She would, under his domination, manifest in seventy-eightwatercolor paintings his awesome, sometimes terrifying vision of the magical andspiritual forces of nature projected though the ancient archetypal images of thetarot.True to the art-film milieu, the climax of this melodrama is played out againstthe chaotic backdrop of wartime London—the troop trains, the rationing, thesirens, the blitz, the blackouts—it really is too romantic for words.It wasn't exactly like that, however. First, to be fair to the memories of thesetwo brilliant and colorful characters, we must remember that they were both intheir sixties. Rumors notwthstanding, Crowley's failing health and Lady Harris'sextremely visible social calendar made it highly unlikely their collaborationwas one mad and titillating adulterous romp.Second, it was Harris, not Crowley, who first suggested that he redesign thetraditional tarot images and write a book about it, which she would illustratewith seventy-eight paintings. Crowley flatly refused, suggesting simply thatthey “get hold of the best available old pack and have them re-drawn withoccasional corrections and emendations.”26 [notes.xhtml#ft26] A project likethat, he speculated, would take only six months to complete. Harris was adamant,however. She insisted upon painting entirely new tarot images that wouldillustrate a comprehensive new book from Crowley. She eventually made Crowley anoffer he couldn't refuse. She would pay him a weekly stipend of£2 a week toteach her magick. Crowley was bankrupt. He acquiesced.Harris was introduced to Crowley by artist friend and London socialite GretaValentine. They were all mutual friends of Clifford Bax, former coeditor of theliterary and art magazine The Golden Hind.Harris was a Co-Mason27 [notes.xhtml#ft27] and no stranger to esoteric subjectsand ritual work, but at the beginning of the project, she was a complete magicalnovice and by no means a tarot expert. Nonetheless, she said she felt impelledby her Holy Guardian Angel28 [notes.xhtml#ft28] to create images that mostaccurately conveyed the deepest magical and spiritual meaning of each card. Shethoroughly acquainted herself with the traditional tarot images and thedescriptions found in The Equinox.29 [notes.xhtml#ft29] She worked tirelesslyfrom Crowley's sketches and notes, and thought nothing of repainting a singlecard as many as eight times to satisfy his demands.Crowley, displaying an uncharacteristic level of gracious candor, readilyadmitted that Harris's genius forced him to apprehend each card as an individualmasterpiece, and that her energy, not his, was the impetus that saw the enormousundertaking through to completion. It was truly a dynamic partnership of twobrilliant and intensely motivated artists.But did Crowley, who fancied himself a good intuitive painter, try to influenceHarris's style in executing the cards? The answer is “yes,” especially early inthe project, when it was obvious that Frieda was bent on a level of expressionthat might have rendered the Thoth deck unrecognizable as tarot. Crowley'sDecember 19, 1939, note to Harris concerning her work on Adjustment and her fearof painting faces gives us an idea of the direction the Thoth Tarot might havetaken had Crowley not put his foot down. He also, with typical Crowleyhyperbole, tears into her circle of friends, who were currently influencing herartistic attitudes:Your feeling about having no forms and faces is merely symptomatic of modernsoul-sickness. It is lack of confidence in one's creative powers. It is the rootof homosexuality as understood in this country and of all these crazy movements,the Neo-Thomists, and the Buchmanites and the Dadaists and the Surrealists.Picasso took it far enough; he tried to paint a chair which could not be anyparticular chair, and must therefore have no colour and no form, but as everychair, in order to be a chair, must have a support for the human frame, he did ahorizontal line. But this is metaphysics and not art; all these half-sexed,half-witted people, sicklied o'er with the pale caste of thought, I cannotbelieve that any of them will ever command either the Exeter, the Ajax or theAchilles, and any man who is not potentially capable of doing that, is not a manat all; he may be some kind of pudding, and I hold no brief against puddings,but all these people who resent simplicity resent manhood, they weave their ownonanistic web of nastiness; these are the shells cast off from the Tree of Life,these are the larvae of abomination. It has been your evil fortune to have fartoo much to do with such people without a proper clinical training, such aswould have enabled you to diagnose their malady; they have small orts ofcleverness without any breadth of vision or balance, without the sense of space,of nature, of fresh air.…I must emphasise that this fear of faces is an appalling symptom of cowardice.It is surely a natural instinct to connect expression with moral ideas, and itis moral ideas, or more correctly magical ideas, that you are out to illustrate.It did not matter so much in this particular card because of the tradition ofJustice being blind, but on the other hand, the masking of the face suggestsdeceit which is the absolute opposite of the intention of the card; it was thefamiliars of the Inquisition, it was the Vehmgericht that administered what theycalled Justice, hooded. Impartiality is a lovely idea, but it doesn't get youvery far; if the impartial person may be impersonated by a demon of malignantdarkness.30 [notes.xhtml#ft30]Why don't you tell us how you really feel, Mr. Crowley!Lady Harris exhibited the paintings on at least three occasions; first in June1941 at the Randolph Hotel in Oxford, then again in July 1942 at the BerkeleyGalleries on Davis Street, London, and in August 1942 at the Royal Society ofPainters in Water Colours on Conduit Street, London. At Harris's insistence,Crowley was not in attendance, nor does his name appear anywhere in the programessays.31 [notes.xhtml#ft31]In 1944, Crowley published the first edition of The Book of Thoth, the textbookthe cards were to illuminate. Assisting him financially with this project andseveral others was a young American soldier, Lieutenant Grady L. McMurtry,32[notes.xhtml#ft32] a member of Crowley's magical order, Ordo Templi Orientis. In1969, he would also be instrumental in arranging to have the seventy-eightpaintings photographed and published as a deck of tarot cards.33[notes.xhtml#ft33]McMurtry was the only person I have ever talked to who actually met Lady Harris.He first met her at Crowley's flat at 93 Jermyn Street, Piccadilly. Shortlyafterward, Crowley moved out of the city to Buckinghamshire. McMurtry and Harriswould meet once again at her home in London. It was a brief encounter, but hisdescription of the event (which I heard him recount at least a half-dozen times)is such a charming peek at Harris's character and so indicative of the milieu ofthe times that I cannot resist attempting to retell it here. I hope Crowleybiographers will forgive if my recollection of McMurty's oft-told story differswith their understanding of objective history.It was in late May 1944, less than two weeks before he would be part of theD-Day Normandy invasion. Lieutenant McMurtry visited Crowley at his home at theBell Inn in Aston Clinton in Buckinghamshire. Because McMurtry had access to ajeep and petrol, Crowley asked him if he could deliver some papers to LadyHarris in London. Excited at the thought of seeing Harris again, he readilyagreed.It was early evening and the city was blacked out by the time he reached theHarris residence at 3 Devonshire Terrace, Marylebone High Street. As heapproached the door, he heard piano music and the sweet notes of Debussy's“Claire de Lune” from inside the Harris home. (McMurtry told me he rememberedthinking what an awkward contrast he made—a lanky American soldier in jump bootsstanding at the door of this genteel gathering.) He knocked, and soon a mandressed in eveningwear opened the door. It was obvious there was a party inprogress; a pianist was entertaining guests. McMurtry stated his business andwas asked to wait outside the door. In a few moments, Lady Harris opened thedoor, greeted him politely, and accepted the paperwork with thanks. Then, as shewas about to close the door in his face, she turned her head for a moment andgazed upon the bright warmth of her party—the quiet talk, the Debussy. For amoment, McMurtry was sure she was going to invite him in. Then she turned tolook at him, in his uniform and boots, and said, “You do understand, of course,I can't invite you in. It would so spoil the mood of the evening.”Contrary to absurd published statements that Crowley grew rich from the sales ofthe Thoth Tarot while Lady Harris went unrecognized and unpaid, neither Harrisnor Crowley would live to profit financially from the project, or even see thepaintings properly manifested as tarot cards.34 [notes.xhtml#ft34] Crowley diedin December of 1947. Harris visited him a few days before he died. He did notrecognize her. She became a co executor of his will and was among the handful ofpeople who attended his funeral. She also hosted a lavish “curry” wake in hishonor in her home in London.After the death of Sir Percy in 1952, Frieda, Lady Harris moved to SrinagarKashmir to live out her years on a houseboat, her modest income supplemented bythe sale of her paintings and writings. Contrary to rumors, the Lady did not dieimpoverished, nor did she regret her relationship with the Beast. In a 1958letter to a friend in England, as she describes the virtues and vices of aKashmiri gentleman friend named Shabau, she fondly contrasts his character withher memories of Crowley.But there is Shabau who remains. He is incapable of telling the truth exceptabout God which I can't prove anyhow, but how charming he is, although sometimesI weary of his naïve interpretations & moral narrowness & long for A. C. who wasso d—d clever &without limitations.”35 [notes.xhtml#ft35]Frieda Harris died in 1962. Crowley, who was noted for rarely saying anythingnice about anyone, paid uncharacteristic tribute to her with adulation in thebiographical note from The Book of Thoth:She devoted her genius to the Work. With incredible rapidity she picked up therhythm, and with inexhaustible patience submitted to the correction of thefanatical slave-driver that she had invoked, often painting the same card asmany as eight times until it measured up to his Vanadium Steel yardstick! Maythe passionate “love under will” which she has stored in this Treasury of Truthand Beauty flow forth from the Splendour and Strength of her work to enlightenthe world; may this Tarot serve as a chart for the bold seamen of the New Aeon,to guide them across the Great Sea of Understanding to the City of thePyramids!36 [notes.xhtml#ft36]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURimages [images/im.jpg]THE ARTWhy haven't I got living fire which could weave musically these beauties. Ican't do it with pigment. I want poetry images [images/a.jpg] music images[images/a.jpg] light, not coloured chalks.37 [notes.xhtml#ft37]—Harris to Crowley, date uncertain.When we ask what makes the Thoth Tarot unique, the first and most obvious answeris the artwork. If we appreciate nothing more about these marvelous cards, it isenough for us to invoke the cliché: “I may not know much about art, but I knowwhat I like.” Sales figures, year after year, prove that a great many peopleknow that they like these cards.The cards of the Thoth Tarot display more than just Lady Harris's skillfulexecution of traditional tarot images, fine-tuned to reflect a more modernunderstanding of self and the natural universe. Any competent cartoonistfollowing Crowley's instructions could have done that. Harris exceeded Crowley'swildest expectations by actually incorporating within the very fabric of herstyle the profoundly subtle essence of his spiritual doctrine. It was a supremewedding of artistic technique and deepest mysticism.Harris's style is characterized by her graphical conversion of the mathematicalconcepts of projective geometry.38 [notes.xhtml#ft38] A provocative expansion ofEuclidean geometry, projective geometry was, in the mid 1930s, the focus ofintense study among the disciples of Rudolf Steiner.39 [notes.xhtml#ft39] Threeyears before she began painting the Thoth Tarot, Harris studied under two ofSteiner's most brilliant students, George Adams and Olive Whicher, and was soonbusy transferring theoretical mathematics to canvas.Projective geometry presumes more than a polarity between a central point and aninfinitely distant surface (center and periphery). Because of the fragility (ifnot the downright nonexistence) of time-space, it allows that a central pointand infinite space can occupy the same position. However difficult (orunimportant) it may be for us to grasp the mathematical subtleties of projectivegeometry, we see it thrillingly manifested in Harris's use of lines, nets, arcs,swirls, twists, and angles stretched and overlaid one upon another, or otherwisecombined to visually redefine the fabric of space. Each time we gaze upon one ofthese cards, we are obliged to transcend the dimensional boundaries of our mindsand momentarily place ourselves in an environment where infinite depth can existsimultaneously with infinite projection.Had Crowley paid Harris anything for her labor, we would have to say that hecertainly got his money's worth. Not only did her stylization make the cardshauntingly beautiful, but by incorporating the tools of projected geometry shealso paid profoundest homage to the “deities” of his new Aeon cosmology.“Deities?” “New Aeon cosmology?” You might be thinking that all of this isstarting to sound like some new California-crackpot religion. Indeed, it is uponthe shoals of terms such as these that many who set sail on the sea of Crowleyfind themselves shipwrecked and drowned. You can take comfort, however, in theknowledge that Crowley's New Aeon deities are not theological personages, astraditional religions would have us imagine. They are simply convenient termsfor natural forces and principles that, because of evolutionary advances inhuman consciousness, we are able to comprehend more clearly than our spiritualancestors.These changes in spiritual consciousness are interpreted into stunning images inthe Thoth Tarot and are precisely what differentiate it from the tarot decks ofthe past. It is, therefore, very important that we know a little bit about NewAeon and the book that Crowley believed to be the fundamental revelation of theage, The Book of the Law."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVEimages [images/im.jpg]THE PROPHET AND THE BOOK OF THE LAWOh! thou art overcome: we are upon thee; our delight is all over thee: hail!hail!: prophet of Nu! prophet of Had!prophet of Ra-Hoor-Khu!

Come in our passionate peace, & write sweetwords for the Kings!40 [notes.xhtml#ft40]I realize that, for many people, al this talk about New Aeons and shifts ofconsciousness may seem to have nothing to do with tarot cards. I assure you ithas everything to do with the Thoth Tarot. If this book is to live up to thepromise of its title, it will be important for you to grasp the key elementsthat make the Thoth Tarot the Thoth Tarot. Foremost among these are therevolutionary doctrines revealed in a tiny book and the strange assertion thatCrowley was a prophet.I confess that, when I first started to explore the cards, I was very uneasywhen I learned that Crowley considered himself some kind of prophet and that thecards might be an illustrated textbook to his weird, and perhaps dangerous, newspiritual movement. I had read some very nasty things about Aleister Crowley andI certainly did not want to waste my time or jeopardize my soul by dabbling with“the dark side.”I soon realized that, if there was any darkness involved, it was the darkness ofmy own fears, not in The Book of the Law or the seventy-eight pieces of printedcard stock of the Thoth Tarot. As is often the case when dealing with Mr.Crowley, things aren't always what they appear at first sight—then again, maybethey are. He is like a quirky uncle who makes you pass a test of patience orcourage before rewarding you with candy. Only afterward do you discover yourreal prize was not the candy, but the priceless reward of cultivating thevirtues of patience and courage.On the 8, 9, and 10 of April, 190 In an apartment in Cairo, Aleister Crowleyreceived (channeled) Liber AL vel Legis, The Book of the Law. It is a curiouslittle book consisting of three short chapters of prose poetry. Thecircumstances leading up to the reception of The Book of the Law are extremelyinteresting and, unfortunately, a subject I will not have much room to discussin this work. I encourage anyone who wishes to learn more about this fascinatingchapter in Crowley's spiritual career to read Thet The Equinox of the Gods41[notes.xhtml#ft41] and any of the excellent recently published Crowleybiographies.Briefly, Crowley and his wife, Rose, were honeymooning in Cairo when Rose fellinto a trance in which she claimed to give voice to the gods of ancient Egypt,particularly the god Horus. At first, Crowley dismissed these “messages” asnonsense. Alter hours of thorough interrogation, however, he became convincedthat Rose could not possibly possess enough technical information to be fakingit.He took her to Cairo's Boulak museum (whose collections are now part of theCairo museum) so she could point out precisely which god was responsible for themessages. Ignoring the more popular images of Horus, Rose excitedly identified asimple wooden stèle from the twenty-third to twenty-fourth dynasties as thesource of the communications. It was the funeral stèle of Ankh-af-na-khonsu, anotable political and religious figure of several royal administrations. ThisStèle of Revealing (see figure 1 [front.xhtml#fig1] on the inside front cover),as it would later be called, triggered a series of psychic and magical eventsthat culminated with Crowley's reception of The Book of the Law.“Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.” “Love is the law, love underwill.” These are the two most recognizable watchwords from The Book of the Law.The “Law” they refer to is the law of Thelema (Greek for “will”).In essence, the book's message is simple. It announces the beginning of a NewAeon in which the spiritual formulae of previous aeons will be amended to betterharmonize with humanity's expanded consciousness. The third verse of the firstchapter [chap1.xhtml] announces that “Every man and every woman is a star”; itdescribes quite succinctly the fundamental shift in our self-identity thatcharacterizes this new period in human evolution. No longer must we viewourselves as cold, dark satellites helplessly orbiting the “sun” of the family,tribe, race, religion, or nation on whom we depend for light and the fixedtrajectory of our lives.The individual is now to be recognized as the primary and preeminent unit ofsociety. It is now possible for humanity to awaken to the liberating fact thateach of us is a star, as unique and self-radiant as our celestial counterparts.Instead of desperately trying to determine the will of God and then clumsilyattempting to cooperate with it, each of us must now come to realize that ourwill, if properly understood and executed, is already in harmony with the divinewill. In other words, in this age, the holy quest is to discover one's own wayrather than trying to guess what a God wants for you and hope from moment tomoment that you are guessing correctly.Perhaps the most important quality of The Book of the Law that sets it apartfrom al other holy books is the fact that no one is allowed to interpret itsmeaning to anyone else. No priest, no preacher, no politician, no professor, nophilosopher can presume to tell anyone what anything in The Book of the Lawmeans. This effectively prevents the formation of the dogma, doctrine, andintolerance that has been the curse of the “great” religions of the past andthat continues today to provoke worldwide religious strife.The three “deities” of The Book of the Law are the main figures that appear onthe Stèle of Revealing; they express the abstract dynamics of the universe. Theyare Nuit (sometimes spelled “Nu” or “Nuith”), the goddess of infinite space, thepersonification of an infinitely expanded universe;42 [notes.xhtml#ft42] Hadit(sometimes spelled “Had” or “Hadith”), the god at the heart of Nuit, thepersonification of an infinitely contracted point;43 [notes.xhtml#ft43] andtheir child, Ra-Hoor-Khuit (sometimes spelled “Ra-Hoor-Khu-it,” “Ra-Hoor-Khu,”“Ra Hoor Khut,” “Ra-Hoor-Khut”), who, on the Stèle, is the hawk-headed godenthroned behind an altar of offerings.These three deities are, in a very real way, the personifications of the keyelements of projective geometry: Nuit the periphery, Hadit the center, andRa-Hoor-Khuit the transcendent “being” that is created when it is recognizedthat the periphery and center simultaneously occupy the same position. As Nuitis infinite out-ness, and Hadit is infinite in-ness, they are both equallyeverywhere and locked in infinite embrace. This is lovemaking on a cosmic scale,and Ra-Hoor-Khuit is the product of this union.The Book of the Law contains several very interesting references to individualtarot cards, but we'll learn more about that in Part II of this book.Egyptian deities and projective geometry may seem like pretty weighty subjectsfor a book about tarot cards. Some of you may even feel uncomfortable when I usethe term “god” or “goddess.” Please know that when I do, I am not referring tospiritual beings who may or may not be at odds with your religion or spiritualworld-view. They are simply convenient terms for natural—indeedmathematical—facts of life that are so fundamental to the fabric of reality thatit is appropriate to refer to them as deities.But what about Aleister Crowley being a prophet? Are we talking about the sameAleister Crowley who caused a sensation in artistic circles by chiseling off thebronze plaque that had been attached (by prudish French authorities) like a figleaf over the genitals of the stone angel marking Oscar Wilde's grave? The sameAleister Crowley who pranced into the Café Royal wearing the plaque as acodpiece and then presented it to the sculptor, Jacob Epstein? Are we talkingabout the same Aleister Crowley whojoked that he had killed and eaten two of hisHimalayan native porters while on a climbing expedition?44 [notes.xhtml#ft44]Are we to believe that this outrageous libertine who seduced scores of women andmen could possibly be a prophet?The Book of the Law declared in no uncertain terms that the “Scribe” (Crowley,or the spiritual entity known to the world as Aleister Crowley) was the prophetchosen by the spiritual forces of human evolution to deliver the good news ofthe New Aeon to the world. For many of us, the word “prophet” carries with it agreat deal of sectarian baggage. Let me assure you that when I refer to AleisterCrowley as a prophet, I am suggesting only that (like shamans of all times andcultures) he was a person who, under certain conditions, was able to observe andthen give voice to the great unseen forces and events that shape the spiritualdevelopment of humanity.These forces and events are not the province of any particular religion orcultural movement. Rather they are symbolic expressions of humanity's changingpoint of view—a point of view that becomes more accurate as our understanding ofthe universe around us improves; a point of view that changes, sometimes subtly,sometimes radically, step by step, as the inevitable result of our evolvingconsciousness.Crowley's revelation (if we choose to call it that) is, in essence, not arevelation at all, but a recognition of certain spiritual facts oflife—universal facts that each of us can recognize if we care to, and that eachof us could communicate to others if we were skilled enough in the use oflanguage.I often hear it said by critics of Crowley, and those who, for one reason oranother, are afraid of him, that he could not possibly be a prophet because hewas so immoral and evil. As each of us have our own ideas concerning what is oris not immoral and evil, it is useless for me to argue that point. Perhaps it ismore productive to debate whether being immoral and evil should necessarilyprevent one from being considered a prophet.It is clear to me from reading the Bible that prophets are very human and havetheir good and their bad days. For example, look at what the Bible tells ushappened when the prophet Elisha had a bad day:And he [Elisha] went up from thence to Beth-El; and as he was going up along theway, there came forth little boys out of the city and mocked him, saying, “Goup, you bald head, go up, you bald head.” And he turned back and saw them andcursed them in the name of the Lord. And there came forth two she-bears out ofthe forest, and tore forty-two of the boys.45 [notes.xhtml#ft45]It is true that Crowley could be as petty and cruel as anyone. He took pleasurein doing many things that most of us would not wish to emulate. At no timeduring his long and infamous life, however, did he commit any felonious crimeserious enough even to warrant arrest, let alone so diabolically evil as to usehis powers to slaughter forty-two innocent children just because they made funof his haircut.While we may concede that all prophets are wild and outrageous characters, itdoes not necessarily follow that all wild and outrageous characters areprophets. What other qualifications did Crowley possess that might temptprovidence to choose him at the turn of the twentieth century to be prophet ofthe New Aeon?In my opinion, the character, the personality, yes, even the brash ego ofAleister Crowley combined to make him the perfect candidate for modernprophet-hood. * He was a passionate and adventurous spiritual seeker, bound from early manhood by severe personal oaths to gain supreme enlightenment; * He was a master poet, adept in the art of transforming abstract concepts into the imagery of language; * He was (as much as any man of his day) intimately acquainted with the gods, religions, and mythologies of both the East and West. This familiarity gave him a rich vocabulary of words and images understandable to people of many cultures and religions. And most important: * He was alive at the very moment a great shift of human consciousness was about to dramatically change the world; * He was sensitive enough to perceive this change and had the language skills to communicate it; * He was willing to suffer condemnation, ridicule, financial ruin, personal tragedy, and professional vilification to tell the world about it.You can argue all you want that Aleister Crowley was a flawed and perfectlynasty individual, that he was despised and a dangerous person to know. Despiteall his shortcomings, however, it is clear to me that he possessed all theingredients necessary to make a prophet. A prophet does not need to be perfect.A prophet does not need to be loved. A prophet does not need to be popular. Aprophet does not need to be harmless. A prophet need only have a vision of thetruth and the courage to give voice to that truth no matter what theconsequences."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXimages [images/im.jpg]THE AEON OF HORUSAbrogate are all rituals, all ordeals, all words and signs. Ra-Hoor-Khuit hathtaken his seat in the East at the Equinox of the Gods.46 [notes.xhtml#ft46]It is obvious to anyone who is more than casually interested that there areseveral major features that distinguish the Thoth Tarot from other moretraditional decks. First, the four court cards of each suit are tided Knight,Queen, Prince, and Princess, rather than King, Queen, Prince, Princess, (orKing, Queen, Knight, Page, or variants found in other decks). Crowley gives us avery interesting explanation for this that I will discuss in detail in chapter11. [chap11.xhtml]He also makes very significant changes to four of the trumps. Cards that have,in the past, borne the titles Justice, Strength, Temperance, and Judgment (orLast Judgment) are, in the Thoth Tarot, respectively named Adjustment, Lust,Art, and The Aeon. Crowley explains that the new titles more accurately conveythe essential meanings of these cards. We will explore why in a moment.Name changes notwithstanding, the basic images Lady Harris painted forAdjustment, Lust, and Art are more or less consistent with their counterparts intraditional packs. The Aeon, the card that replaces Last Judgment, is adifferent matter. Instead of displaying a trumpeting angel awaking the dead fromtheir coffins on Judgment day, The Aeon reveals the beautifully stylized figuresof the deities from the Stèle of Revealing and The Book of the Law: Nuit, theGoddess of infinite space; Hadit, the God of the infinitely contracted point;and Ra-Hoor-Khuit (Horus), the child of their union.47 [notes.xhtml#ft47] Thischange not only radically differentiates The Aeon card from the traditional LastJudgment card, it also serves to cast more subtle changes in other cards of theThoth Tarot.What is the reason for this dramatic departure from Judgment's traditionalimage? According to Crowley, the change was necessitated by the fact that thespiritual event depicted in the old versions of the Last Judgment card hasalready occurred, and The Aeon card has replaced it to illustrate the definingmoment when the old aeon gave way to the new.For many tarot enthusiasts who understand that the tarot is an evolvingspiritual organism, the changes manifested in the Thoth Tarot come as logicaland welcome improvements. For others, the deck is an affront to their spiritualworld-view. The fact that the cards were created by the wicked Aleister Crowleyonly reinforces their dark suspicions. This attitude, in my opinion, is veryunfortunate; in the next few pages, I will do my best assuage the concerns that,for many, may still linger.The traditional tarot trumps are filled with biblical and classical themes and acast of characters that seem to have been plucked directly from Mediaeval orRenaissance street theatre. In the Lovers, we find Adam and Eve in the Garden ofEden. The destruction of the tower of Babel is depicted in the Tower card;Fortune displays the wheel of Ezekiel's vision, and his four creatures graceboth the Hierophant48 [notes.xhtml#ft48] and the Universe cards. The GoddessDiana is the High Priestess, and Prometheus the Magus. We find an Emperor, hisFool, a Pope (Hierophant), a Hermit, a Hanged Man, Death, and the Devil himself.There are celestial trumps: the Sun, the Star, the Moon, and the Universe.Looking at the trumps, even a novice astrologer can locate within the twenty-twotrumps the seven traditional planets and the twelve signs of the zodiac (seechapter 7 [chap7.xhtml]). We hold a universe in our hands when we pick up a deckof tarot cards. Heaven and hell, church and state, stars and planets, elementsand principals, even ancient gods inhabit the seventy-eight pieces of cardstock. Is it any wonder tarot has remained a preeminent tool of divination forcenturies?There is also a dominant theme that runs through the traditional images of thetrumps, a theme whose libretto was born in the last and most mysterious book ofthe New Testament, The Revelation of Saint John the Divine. Here we are firstintroduced to the trumpet-blowing angel of the Last Judgment card and theEmpress, who is obviously “a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under herfeet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars” (Rev. 12:1). The “woman upon ascarlet colored beast” (Rev. 17:3) graces the Strength (Lust) card, and theangel who sets “his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth”(Rev. 10:2) is the classic image of Temperance (Art).49 [notes.xhtml#ft49]Currently, many bible students are reassessing their theories concerning theBook of Revelation—exactly when it was written and what it was originally tryingto communicate. There is now a growing consensus among scholars that what Johnwas actually describing (in veiled imagery understandable to his contemporaryaudience) was not the millennia! end of the world, but the all tooflesh-and-blood details of the apocalyptic holocaust that ended the secondJewish revolt in A.D. 72.Be that as it may, it really doesn't matter whether or not John's Revelation isthe prophetic vision of “end times” or an elaborately coded inter-office memo.The fact remains that, for over a thousand years, its words and images have beenseared into the spiritual consciousness of Western civilization. We may neverknow the true story behind the book, but the book has become a myth, and myth istruer than history.No matter what John was originally trying to communicate, his Revelationconveniently provides to both the sincere seeker and the religious extortionista grotesque vocabulary of terror and hope—the profound terror that comes fromcontemplating one's human inadequacies when standing before a divine throne ofeternal judgment on the day the world is destroyed by fire50[notes.xhtml#ft50]—and the hope of a future existence free of the fears andinjustices of the past. The Revelation of Saint John the Divine certainly hasbeen successful in generating terror. Its singular shortcoming, however, is itsfailure to tell us that the “end of the world” is not really the End of theWorld!What, then, does the traditional Last Judgment card represent? Ironically,Crowley tells us that it does indeed represent the destruction of the world byfire, an event that took place on March 20, 1904, in an apartment in Cairo, whenHorus, the God of force and fire, took his father's throne at the Equinox of theGods—an event that signaled the end of the spiritual world of the dying godOsiris, and the birth of the Aeon of Horus.Crowley taught that, within our racial memory, there have been three aeons. Forliterary convenience, he labeled them after the three principal gods of Egypt:the Goddess Isis; her husband/brother, Osiris; and their son, Horus51[notes.xhtml#ft51] We have just entered the Aeon of Horus, which supplanted theAeon of Osiris, which supplanted the Aeon of Isis.Aeons change, not as the result of some war in heaven or astrological event.Rather they are simply the consequence of some improved modification in humanconsciousness. Obviously, such a mutation needs to be universal and fundamental:something most of us share with our fellows, something as simple as how weperceive our relationship with the Sun.Yes. It's as simple (and as profound) as that. And the Thoth Tarot, as much asany piece of art or literature, reflects the dynamics of this new evolutionarystep. Let's look briefly at the last two aeons to see how our relationship tothe Sun has developed and how it affected the spiritual lives of our ancestors.The following is excerpted from my Angels, Demons, and Gods of the NewMillennium.THE AEON OF ISIS—The Formula of the Great Goddess It is impossible for us topinpoint the dawn of the Aeon of Isis…. Evidence of the worship of the GreatGoddess is found as far back as the age of Leo (10,996 B.C. to 8830 B.C.). Inthis period, when humanity was struggling with the first attempts at socialintercourse, the most awesome mystery to excite the imagination was the power ofwoman. More than any other observable phenomena woman was most godlike. Eachmonth, coinciding with the rhythmic cycles of the moon, she issued blood. Yetmiraculously she did not die. When the cycle of bleeding stopped, her bodychanged; her breasts and belly swelled for nine moons until she burst with waterand new life.Because the earliest Isian-agers were as yet unaware of the cause and effectrelationship between sex and birth, it appeared that woman alone was the sourceof human life. Her life-giving powers were not limited to blood and birth, forfrom her breasts flowed milk, a rich white blood to nourish and sustain the newlife she created. Woman was the human embodiment of the earth itself whichappeared to spontaneously bring forth the vegetation and animals needed tosustain the race. It was the most self-evident fact of life…earth wasmother…mother was life…god was woman. To be in harmony with the formula of theGreat Goddess was profoundly simple, and as long as it was universally perceivedthat life and nourishment came directly from the earth and from woman, allsuccessful endeavors, magical practices and religious expression did her homage.So deeply was this perceived reality impressed upon our ancestor's minds thatlong after they solved the mystery of where babies come from they clungtenaciously to the outward forms of Goddess worship and based all social andreligious institutions on her formula. Eventually, however, as our understandingof the universe around us grew, we were confronted with a more complicatedworld-view and new unsettling mysteries.THE AEON OF OSIRIS—The Formula of the Dying God Even though the formula of thedying god became crystallized in the religions and institutions of theastrological age of Pisces (166 B.C. to A.D. 2000), the Aeon of Osiris dawnedmuch earlier.The advent of agricultural societies necessitated a greater awareness of thecycles of the seasons. Osirian age farmers began to recognize the effectssunlight, or lack of it, had upon vegetation. They observed that at certaintimes of the year the days grew short and crops did not grow. It eventuallybecame evident that, even though the earth brought forth life, the supremecreative energy that vivified that life came from the sun. Coincidental withthis discovery was a universal acknowledgment of the vital role men played inthe procreative process. Just as plant life needed the warm penetrating rays ofsunlight to flourish, so too woman needed the introduction of the male sperm toavoid being forever barren. The heretofore-unrecognized concept of fatherhoodbecame a dominant theme. The Aeon of Osiris truly began when our forebearsraised their eyes to heaven and woke up to the fact that life on earth was apartnership of sun and earth, and the life of the race was a partnership of manand woman. However, the partnership was not perceived as being equal—the malebacklash was severe and unmerciful. Deity was now male, a father, and his powerwas likened to that of the sun.Even though this shift of consciousness was the result of a more accurateassessment of the facts of life than was realized in the Aeon of Isis, it wasnot quite accurate enough. A defect in the perception of cosmological factsplunged our Osirian age ancestors into a dark and terrifying insecurity crisisthat traumatized the human race so severely that we still suffer its effects.This fundamental flaw in understanding caused us to switch our focus from themystery of where life comes from to an obsessive preoccupation with death.The tragic misunderstanding focused on the belief that each day the sun was bornat dawn in the east and died in the evening in the west. Speculations aboundedabout where the dead sun went during the darkness of night and if, indeed, a newone would ever appear again in the east. Perhaps it went to the land of the deadwhere we temporally visit during our nightly little death of sleep. The terrorsand ecstasies of our dreams formed the archetypes of heaven and hell, and, afterwe die, who better to judge our worthiness for either place than the dead sunitself who created and sustained us during our stay on earth. This is preciselythe part the god Osiris would play in Egyptian mythology and Christ's role inChristianity.To further complicate these fears the sun's yearly escapades caused even greateranxiety. Each year at the zenith of the sun's power in summer, it was observedthat each day it rose and set a little south52 [notes.xhtml#ft52] of where itdid the day before. Around harvest time the days grew noticeable shorter and thespecter of the empty harvested fields accented the leafless trees and browninggrasses and painted a melancholy and frightening portrait of nature in articulomortis. It was unsettling enough to have the sun completely disappear each day,but if it continued to head south until night was perpetual, how long could theworld survive in cold darkness before a new sun appears?In an attempt to calm the shattered nerves caused by such musings a few wisesouls took a deep breath and attempted to look at the big picture. Yes, the sundies each evening in the west, but years of observation and the testimony of theoldest members of society indicated that no one could remember a time whenanother one did not come up in the east within a relatively short period. Yes,the sun becomes weak and almost dies each year, but the same observations andtestimony revealed that it eventually reverses its journey south and the daysgrow longer again until a new cycle of life returns to the earth. Based on thebest information at their disposal they concluded that magical power, an unknownand supernatural force, was responsible for the sun's resurrection. They furthersurmised that the secret of this magick must be hidden in the very nature of thesun itself, and if they could only harmonize with that nature then perhaps theytoo could overcome death.Everywhere they looked in nature, they saw the sun's cycle of birth, life, deathand resurrection reenacted. They observed that plants sprouted to the surface inspring and grew tall and strong in the long days and warm sunlight of summer.Then in autumn, at the height of their maturity, they put forth seeds and thendied or were cut down at harvest time. Like the earth itself, the seeds lay deadand buried throughout the lifeless winter, only to spring to life when the rainsand the lengthening rays of the sun transformed the soil into a moist warm womb.They also observed accelerated plant growth near the decaying remains of animalsor people and wherever large amounts of blood spilled upon the ground. Thiswonder was the male/solar counterpart of the female/lunar mystery ofmenstruation. The parallels between sun and phallus, sunlight and semen, thefertilizing power semen had upon woman and that blood had upon the earth did notescape our Osirian ancestor's fertile imaginations. A new “fact of life” (onethat conformed to the secret nature of the sun) became the magical formula ofthe aeon; life comes from death.In order to harmonize with the new formula it would become necessary to take anactive role in the great death/life drama. For the earliest members of the Aeonof Osiris human sacrifice was the supreme pantomime of the sun's daily andyearly sacrifice to the earth. It also illustrated the sacrifice of the potencyof the phallus after ejaculation, and the seed's sacrificial death, burial andresurrection. The spilling of human blood in the unsown or newly planted fieldsresulted in a noticeable increase in the fecundity of the harvest. The mostcomforting benefit derived from such bloody forms of religious expression wasthe undeniable fact that as long as they continued the sacrifices the sun alwayscame up in the morning and always stopped its journey south and returned tobring spring and summer. This put a tremendous amount of power in the hands ofthe priests or priestesses who wielded the sacrificial knife. They positionedthemselves between the people and the gods and implied personal responsibilityfor the rebirth of the sun. With each dawn they became demonstrably morepowerful.At regular intervals all over the world the ceremonial slaughter of the DivineKing assured a bountiful harvest and the well-being of the people. Even thoughthe future victim was titular head of state, he was not a ruler in the modernsense. He was the living embodiment of the sun and therefore supreme monarch ofthe earth. His periodic murder and the coronation of his successor wereoccasions of great solemnity.In the waning years of the Aeon of Osiris the character of the sacrifice evolvedfrom human blood to animal blood to bread and wine. Among the more mysticallyinclined sacrifice became a personal and transcendent experience. Nevertheless,such changes did nothing to disturb the basic magical formula of the Aeon ofOsiris. The cycle of birth, life, death, and resurrection remained the dominanttheme right up to the time of the magical revival of the late nineteenthcentury. By this time, however, the old formula was no longer based uponmisinformation. It was built upon denial.THE AEON OF HORUS—The Formula of the Crowned and Conquering ChildLong after our Isian Age ancestors solved the reproductive mysteries theycontinued to cling to a magical formula that originated at a time when it wasbelieved that all life came spontaneously from woman and earth. So too, in theAeon of Osiris, long after it was common knowledge that the earth revolvesaround the sun, the great religious and political institutions continued to beobsessed with death and resurrection as if they still believed that the sun diedevery day….[Today, the scientific “truths” of our] heliocentric solar system [have] becomean unquestioned reality for all but the most isolated or mentallydisenfranchised inhabitants of our planet. For hundreds of years mothers haveassured their little ones at bedtime that the sun is not gone but only shiningon the other side of the world. It is this simple reassuring truth that is thekey to the formula of the Aeon of Horus. Not a formula of nourishment; not aformula of life, catastrophe, and resurrection; but a formula based upon themagick of continuous growth.In the Aeon of Isis we identified with the earth. Life came miraculously fromearth and woman. Al magical pantheons were aspects of the Goddess. Death was amystery whose depths were impossible to plumb.In the Aeon of Osiris we identi fied with the dying/resurrected sun. Al magicalpantheons were aspects of God the Father. Death could be magically overcome byobedience to formulae, rites and doctrine.In the Aeon of Horus we identify with the self-radiant, ever-living sun. Almagical pantheons have become aspects of ourselves. We, like the sun, do notdie. Death, like night, is an illusion. Life is now seen as a process ofcontinual growth and humanity is developing a consciousness of the continuity ofexistence that will eventually dissolve the sting of death.53 [notes.xhtml#ft53]It is important for us to remember that the traditional images of the tarot weredeveloped during the Aeon of Osiris, an age when it was universally acceptedthat the Sun died each night and was reborn magically each morning. The old LastJudgment trump was a perfect example of the death/resurrection theme of thedying god. As we see, in the Aeon trump of the Thoth Tarot, Crowley has nowreplaced the images of the old formula (resurrected corpses rising from graveson Judgment Day) with new images (the deities pictured on the Stèle ofRevealing), images that reflect the forces at work at the dawn of a new age—theforces that embody the New Aeon formula of continuous life.This is the “good news” of The Book of the Law. This is the “good news” of theAeon of Horus. The Thoth Tarot is arguably the most brilliant and beautifulattempt to convey in images and color this universal prophetic message. Eachcard in the deck is set like a stained-glass window in a magnificent cathedralerected as a celebration of evolving human consciousness. Every person who viewsthem is touched in different ways. Some may wish to meditate on the story theytell. Some may feel impelled to dissect each image minutely. Others may simplywant to bathe in the light and colors. No one, however, leaves this cathedral ofthe New Aeon untouched by the experience."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENimages [images/im.jpg]THE VISION AND THE VOICEThis is the secret of the Holy Graal, that is the sacred vessel of our Lady, theScarlet Woman, Babalon the Mother of Abominations, the Bride of Chaos, thatrideth upon our Lord the Beast.54 [notes.xhtml#ft54]Now we must briefly address an essential component of the Thoth Tarot that, formany people, demands not only an open mind, but also a great deal of spiritualcourage. During his lifetime, this all-important aspect of Crowley's work wasunderstood and appreciated by only a tiny number of his students. Unfortunately,it still remains the source of much controversy and misinterpretation.It is of particular interest to us because several of the trump cards of theThoth Tarot are Lady Harris's dramatic renderings of a series of complex andcurious visions—visions that communicate, in symbols and words, the shifts ofcharacter among the titanic forces that bring an end to one spiritual age andthe beginning of another. Some of these visions are intoxicatingly beautiful;some are dark and terrifying; some seem to wallow in blasphemies. Al of them,like visions recorded by prophets of old, need a key to unlock their meaning.When he was a child, Crowley's exasperated mother caled him the “Beast 666”whenever she thought he was being naughty. Later in life, he would discover richQabalistic significance to this term (and this number) and go on to identify hislife and work with his understanding of its esoteric meaning. This is verydisturbing to many people.It is understandable that anyone with a Christian background would recoil inhorror when he or she first encounters Crowley's shocking use of words andimagery, such as the Beast 666, Scarlet Woman, All-Father Chaos, Whore ofBabylon, or blood of the saints. While these dark “blasphemies” effectivelyserve to screen out faint-hearted dabblers (and all who choose to remainself-blinded by superstition), they offer a radiant and altogether wholesomespiritual treasure for anyone bold and tenacious enough to do a little research(and a little meditation).As we discussed in the preceding chapter, Crowley taught that we stand at thethreshold of a new aeon—a period of profound intellectual and spiritual growthand self-realization. In order to illustrate the evolutionary forces at work atthis pivotal moment, he employed a venerable (but easy to misinterpret) literarydevice. He proceeded to hijack many recognizable terms, images, visions, andcharacters of Egyptian, Hindu, Greek, Hebrew, and Christian mythology. Hetransmuted their character and significance in order to communicate a newmessage—a message for the ears of modern men and women whose rapidly expandingconsciousness has now equipped them to perceive objective and spiritualrealities that would be incomprehensible to the seekers of only a fewgenerations ago.In other words, Crowley took old terrifying concepts such as the Whore ofBabylon and the Beast 666 and, in his own way, redeemed them to representglorious things—as sacred and holy as the concepts of the Madonna and child werein the Aeon of Osiris. He did this, not as a cold-blooded exercise ofintellectual gymnastics, but by personally experiencing a series of ceremoniallyinduced visions that communicated these truths to him in a language ofscriptural imagery with which he was intimately familiar (and that just happento be recognizable to much of the Western world).55 [notes.xhtml#ft55]Foremost among these visions are those he experienced in November 1900 whilemountain climbing in Mexico, and between November 23 and December 19, 1909,while walking across the North Mrican Sahara. A record of these thirty visionswas first published as Liber 418: The Vision and The Voice, in the spring of1911 as a supplement to The Equinox.56 [notes.xhtml#ft56] They are the sourceand the key to the spiritual doctrines of Thelema, including the almostuniversally misunderstood theogony of the goddess Babalon and the All-FatherChaos.57 [notes.xhtml#ft57]Obviously, these visions were intensely personal and, on one level, dealtspecifically with Crowley's own initiatory career. On another level (one thatshould be of particular interest to us), they were also revelations concerningthe universal initiation that humanity and the world is undergoing at thispivotal moment in human evolution.He categorized these initiatory events in the same progressive order as the tendegrees of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, which represent a spiritualascent up the Tree of Life. While all the degrees are important and representlevels of human consciousness, the fifth degree and the eighth degree are majorlandmarks along the spiritual path of return, and Crowley makes frequentreferences to them in The Book of Thoth.In the fifth degree (Adeptus Minor or Lesser Adept), the aspirant achieves unionwith the Holy Guardian Angel, a spiritual entity unique to each of us who, onceattained, serves as our divine companion, mentor, and guide.58[notes.xhtml#ft58] I will talk more about the Holy Guardian Angel in chapter 11[chap11.xhtml].The eighth degree (Magister Templi or Master of the Temple) is most terrible andrepresents the single-most profound moment of our incarnations. It is faced onlywhen the initiate has achieved a level of consciousness so high that in order toproceed farther requires the abandonment of all the old machinery ofself-identity and perception. It means quite literally the annihilation59[notes.xhtml#ft59] of everything that the individual has heretofore believed tobe the components of personality and self.60 [notes.xhtml#ft60]In other words, you can't take anything across the Abyss that isn't the essenceof you.Now, before you throw up your hands and dismiss all of this as just the complexand ridiculous delusions of a cult of nineteenth-century eccentrics, pleasepause and keep in mind that terms such as “Holy Guardian Angel” and “Abyss” aresimply convenient terms for universal spiritual experiences that, in other timesand cultures, are known by other names. Once we grasp the basic concepts, wediscover the Angel and the Abyss in the Vedas, the Upanishads, the ChaldeanOracles, the Emerald Tablet of Hermes, in Plato, in Socrates, even in the Oldand New Testaments. No matter how these initiations may present themselves, nomatter by what name we choose to label them, every human being (indeed everyunit of evolving consciousness) will eventually wed the Angel and face theordeal of the Abyss.Even so, it is understandable that you would ask why any of us should beconcerned with the bizarre visions of one man whose morals we may findrepugnant, whose vocabulary of images are an affront to most of the world'sgreat religions, and whose sanity is still. a subject of debate? I must confessit took many years before I began to appreciate the archetypal essences of TheVision and The Voice and realize how extremely fortunate I was to possess such adocument. Once I shed a few superstitions and fears and carefully examinedCrowley's symbolic images and words, I found it to be, not only an eloquent andcolorful example of one person's initiatory adventures, but also a valuableroadmap to my own spiritual journey.I wish space allowed me to discuss The Vision and The Voice in detail, but thathas been done admirably in The Vision and The Voice with Commentary and OtherPapers61 [notes.xhtml#ft61] It provides an in-depth study of these wondrousvisions and brings the spiritual reality of many tarot images to life.I hope this chapter has assuaged any anxiety you may have harbored concerningthe true spiritual nature of the “blasphemies” that seem to spew from Crowley'sworks, and that you are now prepared to learn more about the Thoth Tarotfearlessly, without “freaking out” at the mention of such things as Babylon, orthe Beast, or the Blood of the Saints, or the Scarlet Woman, or Chaos, or theMother of Abominations."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTimages [images/im.jpg]SECRETS OF THE ROSE CROSS BACKIs not this Symbol to be found upon the breast of all true Brethren of the RosieCross? Holdfast to this Jewel and treasure it as thy Life itself, for many andgreat are its virtues….62 [notes.xhtml#ft62]It may seem odd that I dedicate an entire chapter to the design that adorns theback of each of the seventy-eight cards of the Thoth Tarot (see figure 2[front.xhtml#fig2], inside front cover). I beg your indulgence and assure you(with some confidence) that your patience will be rewarded.For me, the beautiful Rose Cross that appears on the back of each card is theimage that first attracted me to the Thoth Tarot. It is Lady Harris's exquisiteinterpretation of the Hermetic Rose Cross (see figure 3 [back.xhtml#fig3],inside back cover) and is arguably the most recognizable feature of the deck. Asa young tarot enthusiast, I became intimately familiar with every detail of thedesign by helping a friend reproduce the image as a stained-glass window.It was clear to me, even as a novice, that the large red, blue, yellow, andgreen squares that form the extremities of the arms of the cross could representthe four tarot suits of Wands, Cups, Swords, and Disks; and that each of thetwenty-two petals of the great rose represented the twenty-two trump cards. Oneafternoon, after lodge convocation,63 [notes.xhtml#ft63] I was smugly sharingthese observations with another neophyte when I was soundly upbraided by anelderly senior member who fixed his gray gaze on me and, in the most solemntone, informed me, “You have seen but the earliest rays!”I innocently laughed in his face, not out of disrespect, but because hisdelivery was so dramatic and corny I was sure he was trying to be funny. He wasnot amused. “Come with me!” he said. I knew I was in trouble. I felt terrible. Ifollowed him outside the temple, fully expecting to be hurled into the eternal“outer darkness.” Instead, we walked about half a block down the street to wherehis car was parked. I awkwardly started to apologize, but I don't think he heardme. He opened the trunk of his car and lifted a dark purple velvet bag from aleather briefcase. He undid the gold braided tie and lifted out a golden RoseCross about five inches tall. It hung from a blue ribbon and was proportionedexactly like the Harris cross, but was festooned with many more colorfuldetails. He didn't say a word. He just held it up about a foot before my eyesand let it twirl slowly in the late afternoon sunlight.It was indescribably beautiful. Every petal of the great rose was brightlyenameled and displayed an exquisitely formed Hebrew letter of contrasting color.Upon each arm of the cross was a colored pentagram surrounded by the elementalsymbols for fire, water, air, earth, and spirit. The alchemical symbols forsalt, mercury, and sulfur were nestled in the triple lobes that decorated theend of each arm. A hexagram surrounded by colorful planetary symbols wascentered upon the white square directly beneath the great rose.The object was obviously made by a skilled craftsman. The only gold visible onthe front gleamed from the raised outlines (probably gold wire) that trimmed theedges and each of the twenty-two petals of the rose. Each petal was meticulouslyfilled with a rounded drop of colored enamel that gave the appearance of aprecious stone.The back had no enameling at all, just gold polished to a mirrored finish uponwhich words were engraved. My street-side psychopomp would not let me read whatwas written there.64 [notes.xhtml#ft64] After a moment or two of allowing megawk in wonder, he told me with obvious pleasure: “This is the Rosy Cross. It'sall here.” He then put it back in the bag and shut the trunk.I would soon learn that this was the device worn as the personal lamen ofinitiates of the Golden Dawn who achieved the degree of Adeptus Minor (the samedegree in which they are required to paint their own deck of tarot cards).However, the years would reveal to me that it is much more than a colorfuldecoration or a fraternal order's badge of distinction. Properly understood, itis at once the door, the lock, and the key to the temple of the Westernmysteries. It and the Tree of Life (which we will discuss in the next chapter[chap9.xhtml]) quite literally are the Table of Contents of the tarot.THE HOLY QABALAHAs I said earlier, we hold the universe in our hands every time we pick up adeck of tarot cards. The mystery of how the universe was created, how it issustained, and where you and I fit into it has been the spiritual quest of foolsand holy men and women since the dawn of human consciousness. For centuries,students and sages of Hebrew mysticism have developed a unique spiritual sciencecalled Qabalah.65 [notes.xhtml#ft65]Qabalah is not a religion, philosophy, or doctrine. It is a way of thinking, away of looking at the world, a convenient method by which we dissect, examine,and organize the universe and ourselves. It is a means by which we connecteverything in the universe with everything else in the universe. Numbers are thebasic working tools of this marvelous discipline, and some of the most importantnumbers in Qabalistic cosmology are precisely the same numbers upon which thetarot is constructed.“Oh!” I hear you scream. “Not math again! You said there'd be no more math!”Don't worry. Even though Crowley wrote that the tarot “was designed as apractical instrument for Qabalistic calculations and for divination,”66[notes.xhtml#ft66] even though he filled forty-eight pages of Part I of The Bookof Thoth in an attempt to convince us how important the Qabalah is inunderstanding the tarot, I won't force us to dive too deeply into Qabalisticwaters. We will, however, have to get our feet wet, because we won't even beginto understand Aleister Crowley's Thoth Tarot if we don't at least know some veryfundamental things about the tarot as it relates to the Qabalah. So put on youryarmulke and make yourself a cup of coffee. It's a wonderful story, and the RoseCross will help tell it.Let's start at the very center of all—and I really mean the center of all.THE POINTimages [images/40_1.jpg]FIGURE 4. THE POINT.In the Harris painting, it is almost impossible to see the minute white point atthe heart of the tiny rose at the very center of the design. (If it's not there,it should be!) The white point symbolizes the shining point of pure existence,without size, and (as yet) without position. It is not really a point at all,but a state of infinite potentiality. It is the germ of creation before creationbegins. As we will soon see, this point is the inscrutable nail that crucifiesthe tiny rose to the tiny cross. It also affixes the small rose cross to thelarge rose cross.Just where the point came from is a supreme mystery, and Qabalists have soaredto dizzying altitudes of speculation and argument in their attempts tounderstand and explain it. One very popular theory involves three inscrutablequalities of nothingness that, in the dawn of pre-creation, somehow ended upfocusing (or contracting) to a point. They called these three veils Ain, AinSoph, and Ain Soph Aur.Ainimages [images/bv.jpg]Nothing that is so nothing that it negates the conceptof nothing-as-an-absence-of-something. (In other words, we can't even say, “Itis nothing,” because there is no “it” and there is no “is” in this kind ofnothing.)Ain Sophimages [images/bv1.jpg]Limitless Nothing. (Nothing defined). There isnow an “It” in the statement “It is nothing.”Ain Sophimages [images/bv2.jpg]Limitless Light (Positive emptiness). There isnow an “It” and an “is” in the statement “It is nothing.”I won't drag us deeper into these misty musings. I only bring it up because, aswe will soon see, there is one tarot card, the Fool, that characterizes this(these) wonderful (non-) state(s) of nothingness. But we'll meet the Fool soonenough. Let's get back to the “point.”Obviously, it is impossible to grasp the true nature of this preexistent point,but it is the essence and identity of absolute deity. It is also the essence andidentity of your own secret self—the real you that exists at the very center ofall the things you mistakenly think are you. If you truly understand the natureof the point, you understand the nature of yourself and deity.A graphic artist or photographer would tell us that the massive and complexHermetic Rose Cross develops outwardly from this central point. A film directortrying to illustrate this concept might want to start with a close-up of thepoint, then slowly move back to show how the various components of the Crossdevelop. We won't do that.To really see and understand the essence of this great design, we must go insidethe point. We must zoom the camera of our imaginations in, past thecircumference past the white nothingness, into the very heart of the germ ofcreation.THE CUBIC STONEimages [images/41_1.jpg]FIGURE 5. THE CUBIC STONE.When the haze of nothingness disappears, we are presented with the image of acube of what appears to be plain white stone. The ancients symbolized the pointas a white cubical stone that contains within itself the potential of allcreation. When we take a moment to consider how a cube is constructed, we comeface to face with the first great secret of the Qabalah, and the answer to thequestion: Why does the tarot have twenty-two trump cards?First, in order to be a cube, a point needs to extend into three dimensions;updown, right-left, and front-back.images [images/42_1.jpg]FIGURE 6. CONSTRUCTION OF THE CUBE.These three dimensions create seven positions (the center and six sides) thatcreate twelve oblique points or edges to the cube (3 + 7 +12 = 22). Qabalistictradition67 [notes.xhtml#ft67] tells us this is how deity formed the twenty-twoletters of the sacred Hebrew alphabet by which all things in creation areverbally ordered into existence. The Hebrew alphabet is divided into threemother letters (attributed to the three primitive elements), seven doubleletters (attributed to the seven planets of the ancients), and twelve simpleletters (attributed to the twelve signs of the zodiac).TABLE 1. DIVISION OF THE HEBREW ALPHABET WITH ELEMENTAL, PLANETARY, AND ZODIACALCORRESPONDENCESimages [images/42_2.jpg] As long as the cube is sealed, creation is put “on hold,” and these twenty-twomagick power-letters—these dimensions and positions and concepts—remainsuspended in a state of brooding potentiality. They are like the invisible germin the heart of the acorn that throbs with the potential of an eternity offuture oak trees. In order for this sealed cube to initiate creation, it mustsacrifice itself upon a cross by bursting open like a kernel of cosmic popcorn.images [images/43_1.jpg]FIGURE 7. UNFOLDED CUBE—THE GOLDEN CROSS.Creation begins, and we move from potentiality to actuality when, like a livingstone, our white cube unfolds as a golden cross of six squares. Once opened, itreveals its secret treasure, a rose of five petals.images [images/43_2.jpg]FIGURE 8. THE ROSE OF FIVE PETALS.From time immemorial, the number five has symbolized the microcosm, the littleworld of humanity (five fingers, five senses, head and extremities, etc.), andthe number six has symbolized the macrocosm, the greater world of deity.68[notes.xhtml#ft68] In the language of images, the rose of five crucified on thecross of six is a statement that tells us that, as human beings, we areinextricably connected to the larger world—the larger reality of deity. Asabove, so below; the microcosm perfectly reflects the macrocosm; Adam was madein the image of God, and so forth.You might ask, if we are such perfect images of such perfection, why do thingsseem so imperfect? Why is there death and suffering? Why are there wars? Why arethere fleas and black widow spiders? Why is there bad cholesterol? The answer issimple, but most of us are not yet equipped to accept it.We are already—right here, right now—the perfect reflection of a perfect deity.The problem is that we do not have a clue who or what we really are. What werecognize as ourselves—the entity that laughs and weeps, that stubs its toes,falls in love, wins and loses, lives and dies—is not a true reflection ofourselves. We are something altogether different and more wonderful thananything we can imagine.Discovering that the rose of our human fiveness is wedded to the cross ofdeity's sixness is the first goal of every spiritual seeker. The next (and last)goal is for us to identify completely with our secret self and come to the fullrealization that we are neither truly five nor six, but a great big beautifuleleven. This endeavor, for lack of a better name, is called the great work.THE ROSE CROSS OF BEINGThis small rose cross is the supreme glyph of the mystery of being and thecommon denominator between the world of the rose and the world of thecross—between you and me and our huge and all-encompassing counterpart. It is asingle shining point of pure existence that radiates from the center of both therose and the cross.An unstoppable chain of events is set in motion when the cubical stone of primalexistence pops open to create (what I will call) the Rose Cross of Being. Beingnow needs elbow room to manifest. Position, dimension, time, and space must bethe next additions to the creation cycle. Four green barbs radiate in fourdirections from behind the rose as if to say to being “Now that you are—here'ssomeplace to put yourself”THE TWENTY-TWO TRUMPSimages [images/44_1.jpg]FIGURE 9. THE ROSE CROSS OF BEING.The small Rose Cross of Being now gives birth to a larger (graphically speaking)rose. As it does, the heretofore potential qualities of three, seven, and twelveburst forth into actuality, and the twenty-two tarot trumps blossom intoexistence in three stages as the twenty-two petals of a great Rose ofManifestation.First to bloom in the primary colors of yellow, blue, and red are the Fool, theHanged Man, and the Aeon. These three personify the powers and qualities of thethree mother letters of the Hebrew alphabet and the primitive elements of air,water, and fire.69 [notes.xhtml#ft69]images [images/45_1.jpg]FIGURE 10. THREE PETALS OF THE ELEMENTAL TRUMPS.Next to flower in the primary and secondary colors of the rainbow (scarlet,orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet) are the Tower, the Sun, theMagus, the Empress, the High Priestess, the Universe, and Fortune. These seventrumps personify the powers and qualities of the seven double letters of theHebrew alphabet and the seven planets of the ancients: Mars, Sol, Mercury,Venus, Luna, Saturn, and Jupiter.images [images/45_2.jpg]FIGURE 11. SEVEN PETALS OF THE PLANETARY TRUMPS.Last to burst forth in a riot of primary, secondary, and intermediate colors(scarlet, orange-red, orange, amber, yellowish-green, emerald green,greenish-yellow, green-blue, blue, indigo, violet, and crimson ultraviolet) arethe Emperor, the Hierophant, the Lovers, the Chariot, Lust, the Hermit,Adjustment, Death, Art, the Devil, the Star, and the Moon. These trumpspersonify the powers and qualities of the twelve simple letters of the Hebrewalphabet and the twelve signs of the zodiac: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo,Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces.images [images/46_1.jpg]FIGURE 12. TWELVE PETALS OF THE ZODIACAL TRUMPS.THE ROSE CROSS OF MANIFESTATIONImpelled by the creative dynamics that first formed the small Rose Cross ofBeing, the great rose crucifies itself on a large unfolded cube. For conveniencesake, I will refer to this greater figure as the Rose Cross of Manifestationbecause it reveals the mysteries of the manifest universe—of principals,energies, forces (represented by the great rose of twenty-two petals and thetarot trumps) crucified upon the cross of time and space and matter. Thesemysteries, we will soon see, abide in aces, court cards, and the small cards ofthe four suits.images [images/46_2.jpg]FIGURE 13. ROSE CROSS OF MANIFESTATION.YHVH AND THE FOUR SUITSThe Hebrew mystics determined that it was much easier to meditate upon (and dealwith) the qualities of the supreme being if they hypothetically divided it (andconsequently everything else in the universe, including you and me) into fourparts. To do this, they created the concept of a single God who exercised itsomnipotence in a four-fold manner. They even gave this one God a four-lettername,images [images/bv3.jpg] (the Hebrew letters Yod Hé Vau Hé, the Englishletters YHVH, commonly pronounced Jehovah).In a very real sense, YHVH is the “God” of creation. Creation is, after all,what we on earth, with our limited powers of perception, acknowledge as thereality of the world around us. Most of you reading this book, however, have apretty good idea that there is more to the ultimate reality than things we canperceive with our senses. That also means that there is a much greater realitybeyond, behind, and underlying the powers and forces that make up the God ofcreation.The Greeks gave a title to this creator-God who thinks it is God but is tooself-centered to realize that it too was created by something greater. Theycalled it Demiourgos, or the demiurge. Zeus was a demiurge. Another name forZeus is Jove, whose name, spelled in Hebrew, is uncomfortably close to JehovahHTM Because the demiurge is not sure of its origin, it's understandable that itwould be a bit insecure. It might even refer to itself as a jealous god andforbid the worship of any other competing deity. Hmm! But I digress.The formula of YHVH divides the macrocosm into four descending worlds:Atziluth70 [notes.xhtml#ft70] (the archetypal world, the environment of theconsciousness of supreme deity), Briah (the creative world, the world of thegreat archangelic forces), Yetzirah (the formative world, the world of theangelic forces that execute the specific duties of their archangel masters), andAssiah (the material world).At the same time, the formula of YHVH divides the microcosm (and the human soul)into four descending levels: Chiah (the life force), Neshamah (the divinesoul-intuition), Ruach (the intellect), and Nephesh (the animal soul).Finally, all of these four-part concepts can be expressed metaphorically as thefour elements of fire, water, air, and earth, which in the tarot are representedby the four suits, Wands, Cups, Swords, and Disks.When we speak of the four elements, we are not referring to the chemicalelements that are the building blocks of matter. We are simply saying that, forclassification purposes, we divide everything in the universe into four verybroad categories. If anything is something enough to call it “something,” thenit is fiery, watery, airy, or earthy in nature, and falls into one of the fourcategories represented by YHVH and the four tarot suits.TABLE 2. THE FOUR TAROT SUITS ULTIMATELY REPRESENT THE DIVINE NAME, YOD HÉ VAUHÉ, AND ITS FOURFOLD DIVISION OF CREATIONimages [images/48_1.jpg]SPIRITimages [images/48_2.jpg]FIGURE 14. THE FOUR SUITS ON THE ROSE CROSS OF MANIFESTATION.As we face the great cross, we see that the left arm is red to represent thefire suit Wands, the right arm blue for the water suit of Cups, the top yellowfor the air suit of Swords, and the lowest extremity green for the earth suit ofDisks. The square directly below the great rose is white and represents thefifth element, spirit. No single suit is attributed to spirit, for the influenceof spirit pervades the entire deck—indeed, pervades all creation.In the manifest universe, it is the job of the four elements to combine witheach other. Nothing is entirely fire or water or air or earth. Even on thematerial plane, we see this is so. For example, hot magma from a volcano isfiery because of its heat, watery because it flows, earthy by nature, and exudesgas and steam. A lover's quarrel is fiery and explosive, watery because of theemotions, and airybecause it is swift and communicative.Something is needed to bind the four elements together in infinite proportionsand combinations in order to construct the universe. Something is also needed tokeep the elements from melding and turning the universe into one big glob ofmush. That something is spirit and, in the language of symbols, it is expressedby the pentagram.images [images/49_1.jpg]FIGURE 15. THE PENTAGRAM—SPIRIT RULERSHIP OF THE FOUR ELEMENTS.THE ACES AND COURT CARDSIn tarot, the ace of each suit represents spirit in its purist form. Dwellinginside each ace are the four court cards of the suit. It's as though we look atan ace under a microscope and see that it is composed of a fiery component (theKnight), a watery component (the Queen), an airy component (the Prince), and anearthy component (the Princess).images [images/49_2.jpg]FIGURE 16. THE PENTAGRAM—THE ACE AND THE COURT CARDS.images [images/50_1.jpg]FIGURE 17. THE COURT CARDS ARE ELEMENTAL ASPECTS OF THE ACE.TABLE 3. ELEMENTAL SUBDIVISIONS OF THE ACES AND COURT CARDSimages [images/50_2.jpg]Four pentagrams, representing the ace and four court cards of each suit, areplaced upon the extremities the Rose Cross of Manifestation.It is the cosmic duty of the elements to combine and ^ix with each other inorder to facilitate creation. We will see this demonstrated in greater detaillater in our discussion of the aces, court cards, and small cards. On thediagram of the Hermetic Rose Cross, this elemental churning process is suggestedby the colors of the four pentagrams on the arms of the cross: * The pentagram representing the ace and court cards of fire (on the left arm) is colored green, (the combination of air-yellow and water-blue); * The pentagram representing the ace and court cards of water (on the right arm) is colored orange, (the combination of air-yellow and fire-red); The pentagram representing the ace and court cards of air (on the top arm) is colored purple, (the combination of fire-red and water-blue).images [images/51_1.jpg]FIGURE 18. FOUR ACES AND SIXTEEN COURT CARDS.But what about the pentagram of earth, on the lowermost extremity of the cross?You will notice, as we continue to study the tarot, that in almost every case,the element of earth is treated differently than the other elements. It is asthough earth is the stepchild of the elemental family (no offense tostepchildren). Think about it. We didn't see earth manifest along with fire,water, and air when the Great Rose started to blossom, did we? We will soondiscover the Princess (the earthy aspect of her court-card family) doesn't getto rule thirty degrees of the zodiacal year like her father, the Knight; hermother, the Queen; and her brother, the Prince. What gives? Is earth really anelement?The answer is one of the most wonderful mysteries of the tarot, indeed, one ofthe most important secrets of Western Hermeticsm. Crowley tells us it is “thegeneral doctrine that the climax of the Descent into Matter is the signal forthe redintegration by Spirit.”71 [notes.xhtml#ft71]I know that sounds like the kind of snooty Crowleyism that this book is meant toavoid. For years, the above phrase from the Book of Thoth didn't make any senseto me at al. I thought the word “redintegration” was a typographical error andthat Crowley meant to write “reintegration.” “Redintigration” is indeed a word—avery archaic word meaning restoration to a former state. The importance of thisword, and the “doctrine” Crowley mentions above will become clearer in chapter11 [chap11.xhtml] (which concerns the Holy Guardian Angel) and when we begin todiscuss the individual cards. For now, let's be satisfied to know that elementearth is the lowest of the low in the universe. Therefore, it is especiallysacred to and especially linked with the highest high.On the Hermetic Rose Cross, the earth pentagram is pure white, but the entirelower extremity of the cross, upon which it sits, is divided into four sectionscolored black, citrine (a mixture of blue, red, and yellow but with apredominance of yellow), olive (a mixture of the same colors but with apredominance of blue), and russet (the same but with a predominance of red).It is as though what began as the pure white light of the minute point at thecenter of the tiny rose has passed through a prism and separated into all thecolors of the spectrum in the Great Rose. Then al the colors have mixed andremixed to form all aspects of creation until, by virtue of their own vibratoryweight, they settle to the very bottom of the cross as dark and polluted colors.The pentagram that seals them is pure white, as if to say “This mess may be thelowest of the low, but it has something that no other section of creation hasexcept the highest high—that is, a little bit of absolutely everything!”THE MACROCOSMIC HEXAGRAMThe white square directly under the great rose contains a hexagram displayingthe Sun surrounded by the other six planets of the ancients. Placing this symbolof the macrocosm in the midst of the four pentagrams of the microcosm echoes ona higher octave the symbolic message of the marriage of the human and the divinethat was first told by the small rose and cross. Those of you who are familiarwith the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram will recall the words, “For about meflames the Pentagram. And in the column stands the six-rayed Star.”72[notes.xhtml#ft72]images [images/52_1.jpg]FIGURE 19. ELEMENTAL PENTAGRAMS OF THE MICROCOSM; PLANETARY HEXAGRAM OF THEMACROCOSM; UNION OF 5 AND 6, THE SYMBOL OF THE GREAT WORK ACCOMPLISHED.images [images/53_1.jpg]FIGURE 20. THE COMPLETED HERMETIC ROSE CROSS.THE ALCHEMICAL SYMBOLSOur examination of the Hermetic Rose Cross would be incomplete if we didn'texamine the symbols of the three alchemical elements of sulfur, mercury, andsalt, whose glyphs are found in the triple lobes at the end of each arm of theGreat Cross. Not to be confused with the natural elements of fire, water, air,earth, and spirit, the three alchemical elements represent universal qualitiesor principals that interact with and are profoundly dependent upon each other.Crowley tells us thatSulfur is Activity, Energy, Desire; Mercury is Fluidity, Intelligence, the powerof Transmission; Salt is the vehicle of these two forms of energy, but itselfpossesses qualities which react on them.73 [notes.xhtml#ft73]Notice that symbols for these three alchemical principals occupy different lobeson each arm of the Cross. Mercury is placed in the central lobe of the top andbottom arm, indicating dominance in air/Swords and earth/Disks. The symbol ofsalt dominates on the right arm (water/Cups), and the symbol of sulfur dominatesthe left arm (fire/Wands).The secondary lobes of each arm are occupied with symbols of the not-so-dominantalchemical principals arranged in a logical and balanced manner. This is veryimportant because, when these three principles are combined and balanced, theycreate the alchemical substance known as “vitriol,” the universal solvent.Vitriol will soon become very import to us as we study the inner mechanics oftarot. It is the initials of the alchemical motto: Visita interiora terraerectificando invenies occultum lapidem (Visit the interior parts of the earth:by rectification thou shalt find the hidden stone). In his discussion of thetrumps, Crowley goes so far as to identify three cards with the alchemicalelements: the Magus is mercury, the Empress is salt, and the Emperor is sulfur.Other trumps also have alchemical significance. The Art card is identified withvitriol, and the Lovers, the Hermit, Death, and the Devil all have vital rolesto play in the alchemy of the tarot. There is also one more extremely importantalchemical symbol we will see often when we examine the trumps. It is called theOrphic egg. “This egg represents the essence of all life that comes under theformula of male and female.”74 [notes.xhtml#ft74]THE THREE GUNASCrowley's reference to the rajas of Hindu philosophy necessitates, at thispoint, a brief discussion of the gunas. The concept of the three alchemicalelements is almost identical to that of the three gunas of Hindu cosmology. Thethree gunas are rajas, sattvas, and tamas (corresponding uncannily to sulfur,mercury, and salt). “”Al the qualities that can be predicated of anything,”Crowley points out, “may be ascribed to one or more of these Gunas: Tamas isdarkness, inertia, sloth, ignorance, death and the like; Rajas is energy,excitement, fire, brilliance, restlessness; Sattvas is calm, intelligence,lucidity and balance.”75 [notes.xhtml#ft75]These three qualities are universally present and at work in all manifestedenergy (including matter and you and me). They are in constant conflict and, atany given moment, one of them gains temporary dominance. Cosmic balance,however, dictates that no one principal can remain on top for very long beforeanother usurps its position to enjoy its moment in the Sun.The mechanics of this eternal three-way conflict is the driving force that turnsthe great wheel of the ever-changing universe. It is illustrated beautifully inthe Thoth Tarot as Atu X, Fortune, where rajas (sulfur) is represented as thefigure of the Sphinx, sattvas (mercury) by Hermanubis, and tamas (salt) by thefigure of Typhon. More about this when we discuss Fortune.THE BARBED ROSE LEAVESRadiating like glories from behind the Great Rose are twelve barbed roseleaves—four large leaves each flanked by two small leaves. The four large leavescontain the letters I N R I and the astrological symbols for Virgo, Scorpio,Sol, and Virgo respectively. Three of the smaller leaves contain the letters L VX and three contain the letters I A O. The remaining two smaller leaves containan additional letter I and a small Calvary Cross images [images/bv4.jpg] To beperfectly frank, I have never learned a satisfactory explanation for thepresence or positioning of these two seemingly superfluous figures.The letters INRI are placed on the large leaves in the following order: I—upperleft; N—upper right; R—lower left; I—lower right. The letters IAO and an extra Iare placed on the smaller leaves to the right of the large leaves in the sameorder. The letters L V X and a small Calvary Cross are placed on the smallerleaves to the left of the large leaves in the same order. Because the HermeticRose Cross is the personal lamen of Adeptus Minor initiates of the Golden Dawn,and because the letters I N R I, L V X, and I A O play a key formulaic role inthe mysteries of that degree, it is very appropriate that they appear on thedevice itselfI N R I can mean many things, including the venerable alchemical axiom, Igninatura renovatur integra (All of nature is restored by fire), and the powerfulspell that I often use to repel obnoxious telemarketers: I'm not reallyinterested! Christian tradition, however, informs us that, at Christ'scrucifixion, Pontius Pilate ordered that a sign be posted at the head of thecross declaring in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, “Jesus of Nazareth, King of theJews.” The real sign must have been pretty large to accommodate the three setsof messages, but future artists would be satisfied to display only the fourletters I N R I (the initials of the Latin words “Iesus Nazarenus, RexIudaeorum”) painted on a wooden board nailed at an angle above the head of atortured and bleeding Jesus. For at least 1,400 years, the placard displayingthe Latin letters INR I has been an indispensable accessory to everywell-dressed crucifix.Not being satisfied with the officially sanctioned explanations of these lettersthat appear on holy images and souvenirs, Christian mystics and others toyedwith the heretical idea that there just might be something else—some esotericmeanings—to the images of popular religious symbolism. Risking the stake, thesespiritual outlaws proceeded to analyze I N R I in such a way that it eventuallysaid something other than Jesus from Nazareth, King of the Jews. That somethingelse was the magical formula (and the signs of that formula) that expressedtheir highest understanding of the cosmic secrets of life, death, andresurrection. Briefly, here's what they did.They first took the Latin letters I N R I and translated them into the Hebrewletters images [images/bv5.jpg] (reading from left to right: Yod, Nun, Resh,Yod). Then they meditated upon the astrological meanings of these Hebrew lettersand discovered that they tell (in their own astrological way) the familiarEgyptian solar myth of Isis (Yod/Virgo) who mourns because an evil relativeApophis (Nun/Scorpio) has killed her husband, Osiris (Resh/Sol). Isis eventuallyraises Osiris from the dead, and the whole cycle starts again every morning andevery springThat is how I N R I becomes I A O (which just happens to be the name of thesupreme god of the Gnostics, who embodies the magical formula of life, death,and rebirth). Properly understood, the formula of I N R I / I A O explains themystery of the annual revolution of the Earth around the Sun and its diurnalrotation upon its own axis. That is the highest mystery our Osirian Ageancestors could understand. It is also the secret mystery knowledge of allagricultural civilizations of the Age of Osiris. Not bad for seven letters(three of which are Is).By tradition, Isis, Apophis, and Osiris, are pictured making certain gestures orsigns:In the sign of the Mourning of lsis, Isis holds her arms, suggestive of theletter L.In the sign of Apophis and Typhon, Apophis thrusts his arms above his head at aninety-degree angle, suggestive of the letter V.In the sign of Osiris Slain, he holds his arms out to his sides as if he werecrucified.In the sign of Osiris Risen, he crosses his arms over his chest, forming an X onhis body.77 [notes.xhtml#ft77]Taken together, these are the signs of LV X, the Latin word for “light.” Here ishow the key word I N R I is analyzed in formal ceremony:I N R IYod. Nun. Resh.

The Light of the Cross.Magical tradition informs us that, on the material plane and in normal wakingconsciousness, symbols are symbols and living things are living things. On themagical plane and in visionary consciousness, symbols are living things andliving things are symbols. In other words, if I have a vision of a lion or amonkey, those images are merely symbols of something far deeper and abstract inmy psyche that I need to confront. Conversely, symbols in visions are actuallyliving things in that plane. Let's say I am faced, in a vision, by a terriblefire demon (a symbol of something I need to confront). I need only protectmyself with a symbol—perhaps the banishing pentagram of fire, a symbol to me ofthe mastery of spirit over the elements, but a living thing to the demon who isforced by al the laws of its own existence to submit and obey.I only bring up this tidbit of magical lore to impress upon you the immeasurablesymbolic power stored in the Hermetic Rose Cross. Viewed on the magical plane,the Cross is teeming with magnificent life and energy. The adepts of the GoldenDawn who wear it as their personal lamen are possessed with a most powerfulmagical tool indeed.Now, before we look at the cards themselves, let's learn just a little bit aboutthe Tree of Life."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINEimages [images/rm.jpg]SECRETS OF THE TREE OF LIFEThe Tree of Life—This figure must be studied very carefully, for it is the basisof the whole system on which the Tarot is based. It is quite impossible to givea complete explanation of this figure, because (for one thing) it is quiteuniversal. Therefore it cannot mean the same to any one person as to anyother.78 [notes.xhtml#ft78]The Hermetic Rose Cross has certainly yielded many of her secrets concerning thecosmic roots of the twenty-two trumps, the four aces (suits) and the sixteencourt cards. However, she does not do a very good job of telling us why thereare nine (ten, if you count the Ace) small cards in each suit. To understand themysteries of the small cards, we are first going to have to learn a little bitabout another Qabalistic figure, the Tree of Life (Etz-Ha-Chayim).The schematic diagram commonly known as the Tree of Life is arguably the mostrecognizable image of the Qabalah. It was first published in 1652 in AthanasiusKircher's Oedipus. Ægyptiacus, and quite neatly serves to condense a great dealof Qabalistic wisdom into a very small space. It is particularly illustrative ofthe opening paragraph of perhaps the most influential Qabalistic texts of alltime, the Sepher Yetzirah (The Book of Creation).Yah, the Lord of hosts, the living God, King of the Universe, Omnipotent,All-Kind and Merciful, Supreme and Extolled, who is Eternal, Sublime andMost-Holy, ordained (formed) and created the Universe in thirty-two mysteriouspaths of wisdom by three Sepharim, namely: 1) S'for; 2) Sippur; and 3) Sapherwhich are in Him one and the same. They consist of a decade out of nothing andof twenty-two fundamental letters. He divided the twenty-two consonants intothree divisions: 1) three mothers, fundamental letters or first elements; 2)seven double; and 3) twelve simple consonants.79 [notes.xhtml#ft79]images [images/59.jpg]FIGURE 21. THE TREE OF LIFE.In the previous chapter [chap8.xhtml], we learned that the thirty-two mysteriouspaths of wisdom are comprised of the twenty-two letters (trumps) and theirdivision by three, seven, and twelve. Now we will learn just a little bit aboutthe “decade out of nothing.”We ten-fingered bipeds have always had a healthy respect for the numbers ten andfour. As a matter of fact, it appears that our hands and fingers are the sourceof much ancient Qabalistic meditation—wisdom that would later help construct thetarot. I won't bore you too much on this subject, but I will pause to point outthat: * The tenth letter of the Hebrew alphabet is Yod, the Hebrew word for “hand”; * Our opposable thumb (working in cooperation with our other four fingers) is one of the most important attributes that separates humans from other animals and is the fundamental key to making us creative beings and the masters of our environment; * As tradition informs us that we are made in the image of deity, it follows that the creative “hand of God” must be the work of a single deity (spirit/ace) that expresses itself in a fourfold manner (YHVH…four Qabalistic worlds, four parts of the soul, four elements, four tarot suits, four court cards); * Four and ten are inextricably related and mutually definable by simple mathematics (10 = 1+ 2+ 3+ 4).The following is from Angels, Demons and Gods of the New Millennium and gives abrief summary of the creation of the “decade out of nothing.” Please do notworry if at first you find it difficult to follow the logic of how the Tree ofLife is constructed. Believe it or not, once you grasp the basic concept, it ismuch easier to think about than it is to explain.The Tree of Life is a linear schematic of ten emanations and twenty-two pathsupon which the universal mechanics of energy and consciousness are projected. Inone respect it is a very unsatisfactory diagram for it attempts todimensionalize the transdimensional. It has been called the diagram of theanatomy of God, and if we are indeed created in the image of God then that meansthat it also reveals the spiritual anatomy of each of us. Students of KundaliniYoga agree, and point out that the seven chakras or spiritual centers in thehuman body can be projected quite comfortably upon the Tree of Life.All ten sephiroth, or emanations, of the Tree are really only aspects or facetsof the top (first) sephira, Kether, which represents the totality ofexistence—the supreme monad. But even the concept of ONE is a blemish upon thesublime perfection of the pre-existent ZERO.80 [notes.xhtml#ft80] If ONE is toexist and become conscious of its oneness it must reflect itself (like a yogi inmeditation who reaches to the core of being and exclaims “that's what I am!”).The mere act of reflection creates TWO images [images/61.jpg].(ONE is nowconscious of itself and its reflection.) The knowledge that there is adifference between ONE and TWO instantly creates a third condition images[images/61_1.jpg]. This “trinity” by itself is still an abstraction and existsonly in potentiality. Nevertheless, a primal pattern has been established by theprocess of 0NE becoming THREE. This archetypal germ sets into motion achain-reaction that animates the entire creation scenario—the process ofconsciousness/light/spirit descending into matter.The phenomenal universe manifests through a process of degeneration in the nextseven sephiroth. The trinity unit FOUR-FIVE-SIX is created by the reflection ofthe ONE-TWO-THREE unit images [images/61_2.jpg] and the same process thatcreated THREE from ONE-TWO creates the third trinity unit of SEVEN-EIGHT-NINE.images [images/61_3.jpg] TEN, the world of matter, is rock bottom and danglesfrom the Tree of Life like an afterthought of creation: images[images/61_4.jpg]81 [notes.xhtml#ft81]This is the “decade out of nothing.” It is the fundamental pattern of creation.Theoretically, every conceivable idea, quality, principal, aspect, and tendencyfinds a home in one of the ten pigeon-hole sephiroth of the Tree of Life. Butthe Hebrew mystics were not satisfied with just one Tree of Life. God is One.True. But the one God has a four-letter name, images [images/nt.jpg] YHVH, bywhich it manifests.And so, the ancient Qabalists found it easier to meditate upon the qualities ofone by considering it in terms of four. Consequently, for practical purposes(and especially for tarot), we find ourselves dealing with four Trees of Liferepresenting the four letters images [images/nt.jpg]YHVH, the four Qabalisticworlds, the four parts of the soul, the four elements, and the four tarot suits.The titles of the ten sephiroth are consistent in all four Trees of Life (seepage 62).THE FOUR TREES OF LIFE, THE ACES, AND SMALL CARDSThe ten sephiroth, or emanations, of each of the four Trees of Life are joinedtogether by twenty-two paths that are portrayed in tarot as the twenty-two trumpcards and the letters of the Hebrew alphabet. The forty sephiroth of the fourtrees are perfectly represented in tarot as the four aces and the thirty-sixsmall cards.images [images/62.jpg]The area (or non-area) between the supernal triad (sephiroth 1-2-3) and the restof the Tree is called the Abyss. It is an inscrutable looking glass thatseparates the ideal (the abstract concepts of 1-2-3) from the actual (themanifest qualities of the phenomenal universe). Consequently, we view the aces,twos, and threes of the four suits a bit differently than we do the other smallcards, because they are the supernal triad of their respective Trees of Life.The cards of the supernal triad are one big happy family, a single unit thatembodies the essence of the suit. Why are they so happy?All four aces are happy because they represent the Kethers of their Trees ofLife and the root of their elements. Al the twos and threes are happy because,along with their aces, they reside comfortably above the Abyss. The twos(Dominion, Love, Peace, and Change) are the first manifestation of their suitsas ideas. They are outrageously happy just to exist as the expression of theirrespective aces. The threes (Virtue, Abundance, Sorrow,89 [notes.xhtml#ft89] andWork) were created automatically at the moment one reflected to become two. Thethrees exist from necessity to stabilize the twos and form the womb in which allthe other small cards can incubate. Pretty abstract, eh?Please note that, in the above paragraph, I stressed the word “represent.” Thatis because the small cards are not the sephiroth themselves. Even though, forpractical purposes, we work with small cards as worthy representatives of thesephiroth, the sephiroth themselves are of a vastly superior order of spiritualreality than could ever be defined by the character and behavior of four sets often cards. In fact, the small cards are sub elemental in nature—blind forcesthat are merely sympathetic echoes of the sephiroth that have filtered down intothe elemental universe. Nevertheless, even though we are possessed with limitedpowers of perception, we can learn a great deal about the nature of thesephiroth by listening to these echoes—by observing (in an indirect way) howthey color and affect the blind forces of the elements represented by the smallcards.Because Atziluth is the native world of Wands, and Briah is the native world ofCups, and Yetzirah is the native world of Swords, and Assiah is the native worldof Disks, one might think that all small-card Wands, Cups, Swords, and Diskswould be happy in their respective Tree of Life. It doesn't work that way. Eachof the four Trees of Life, because of the uniqueness of the world theyrepresent, has areas of strengths and weaknesses that differ from those of thetrees of other worlds. For example, Yesod may be strong in Atziluth (Wands), butweak in Briah (Cups) and Yetzirah (Swords), and so on.RULES OF THUMB(I suggest you bookmark this page and refer to it often as you study thecharacteristics of the of the small cards.)Unless there are strong astrological mitigating factors (which we will soondiscuss), the following is generally true: * Aces, twos, and threes (cards of the supernal triad) are very strong and together define their suits in principal; * Fours (being the first manifestation of their suit below the Abyss) define their suits in actuality. As a matter of fact, because they have no idea what life is like above the Abyss, the fours (like the Demiurge) mistakenly believe themselves to be the aces of their suits. They are very strong and, like the Demiurge Zeus, establish their element's “rule of law”; * Fives are active and strong, but unbalanced and troublesome. (Shall we say downright horrible?); * Sixes are invariably strong and noble representatives of their suits (being the direct reflection and first balanced manifestation of their ace); * Al the sevens (being unbalanced and low on the Tree of Life) are very difficult and for the most part, perfectly awful; * Eights have much in common with the sevens (unbalanced and low on the tree). However, eights have fallen so low that they are starting to run out of the original energy of the suit, and so their planetary and zodiacal attributes become very important factors. Some are good—some not so good; * Nines generally are stable and supportive of the suit. The exception is the Nine of Swords; * Tens generally are a disaster because, with the exception of the Ten of Disks, they are about to completely lose their suit identity and plunge into a lower world. The Ten of Disks is the exception. Being the last small card, it has nowhere to go but back up to the top. That trick, we will ultimately learn, is the secret that sustains the universe.We can think of the ten sephiroth of the Tree of Life as representing a descentof energy. In that case, we are actually contemplating the creation of thephenomenal universe. We can think of the sephiroth as representing a descent ofconsciousness. In that case, we are actually contemplating the true meaning ofthe concept of the fabled “fall of man.” We can also think of the sephiroth asthe descent of light—and when light descends we have color."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TENimages [images/rm.jpg]WORLDS OF COLOR“…God is light…” (First John: 1:5)Now that we know a little bit about the Qabalah, the Hermetic Rose Cross, andthe Tree of Life, we can discuss one of the most important aspects of the visualmagick that is the Thoth Tarot. One of the most striking features of the deck isLady Harris's curious use of color. Although, in my opinion, all the cards areexotically beautiful, there are a few of them that I have a hard time looking atfor any length of time without feeling a bit nauseous. Perhaps this was herintention for cards such as the Seven of Cups (Debauch) or the Nine of Swords(Cruelty), but it is also obvious that her choice of colors was dictated bysomething other than aesthetics. That something other was the fourfold colorscale developed by the adepts of the Golden Dawn.Imagine, if you will, that the consciousness of the supreme deity is pure light(a venerable universal concept to be sure). Now imagine the divine light passingthrough a prism and diffusing on the other side into all the colors of thespectrum. This is one way Qabalists (and physicists) visualize the process ofcreation—pure light (divine consciousness) breaking up and slowing down tobecome units of energy, mind, and matter.The magick prism that does all this primal light shattering is none other thanimages [images/nt.jpg]YHVH itself, who, true to its fourfold nature, divides thelight into four vibratory frequencies that will eventually manifest as fourscales of color. The King scale is the highest, and represents the essence—theinvisible foundation of color. With the Queen scale, color actually manifests asthe eye beholds it (shades, primary and secondary colors, etc.). The Princescale combines the colors of the King and Queen scales, and the Princess scalerepresents the lowest, most mixed and polluted levels of light.Now imagine four Trees of Life, one for each of the four Qabalistic worlds. Thelight of the King scale filters through and paints the ten sephiroth andtwenty-two paths of the Tree of Life representing the highest world, Atziluth.The light of the queen scale filters through and paints the sephiroth and pathsof the tree of the next lower world, Briah. The light of the Prince scalefilters through and paints the tree of Yetzirah, the next lower world. Andfinally, the light of the Princess scale filters through and paints the Tree ofLife of the lowest world, Assiah.At the end of the day, we have a total of forty colors representing the aces andsmall cards and ninety-six colors representing the trumps.90 [notes.xhtml#ft90]Appendix B in The Book of Thoth itemizes these colors in four pages ofwell-organized charts.91 [notes.xhtml#ft91] I refer you to my versions, Tables 4and 5. For the most part, these charts are arranged according to the SepherYetzirah's thirty-two paths of wisdom Key scale92 [notes.xhtml#ft92] * Key numbers 1 through 10 refer to the ten sephiroth of the Tree of Life (in the tarot, these ten are the ace and the nine small cards of each suit); * Key numbers 11 through 32 refer to the twenty-two paths of the Tree of Life that connect the sephiroth. The twenty-two Hebrew letters are positioned on these paths. In the tarot, these are, of course, the twenty-two trumps.93 [notes.xhtml#ft93] * The tarot trumps are numbered 0-21. Do not confuse these numbers with the Key numbers.Now that we know that the Thoth Tarot is theoretically splashed with one hundredthirty-six colors, we might well ask where these colors came from. The veryspecific names for many of them were unromantically lifted directly from thelabels of tubes of Winsor and Newton water colors (Designers Gouache series),which were popular with Victorian artists and are still available from W&Ntodays94 [notes.xhtml#ft94]. But just who was it who assigned them to theirparticular Qabalistic pigeonholes? The answer, like most other mattersconcerning the Thoth Tarot, is complex and open to some speculation.There is very little debate that the four scales of color issued as part of theGolden Dawn curriculum were ultimately set down by S. L. MacGregor Mathers. Itis also clear that he had help from others, including someone who was veryknowledgeable in color theory. This was most likely his artist wife, Moina.The Qabalah, of course, was a major influence in the selection of colors. Themere fact that the degeneration of colors represents a “fall” down the fourTrees of Life is proof of that. The King scale appears to be the result of abattle between the red of severity and the white of mercy, as outlined insections of the Zohar. In other scales, we see the elemental, planetary, andzodiacal colors familiar to us from the Sepher Yetzirah. But Qabalah is not theonly tradition Mathers and company drew upon for inspiration. Astrology andalchemy are also rich in color symbolism and traditions that surely influencedmany of the color selections. Perhaps most intriguing is the likelihood thatsome colors were selected as the result of magically induced visions. Skrying inthe spirit vision and aura experiments were part and parcel of the Golden Dawncurriculum. The various rays and flecks found in the suit of Disks areespecially characteristic of such astral visions.TABLE 4. COLORS ATTRIBUTED TO THE TRUMPSimages [images/67.jpg]TABLE 5. COLORS ATTRIBUTED TO THE SMALL CARDSimages [images/68.jpg]Citrine combines blue, red, and yellow with a predominance of yellow; olive,with a predominance of blue; russet, with a predominance of red; and theserepresent respectively the airy, watery, and fiery sub elements. Black is theearthy part of earth.I would love to be able to tell you that Lady Harris simply chose the dominantcolors for the individual cards directly from the appropriate box in the fourscale charts. But, if we spend just a few minutes with the cards and the charts,we see that this is not the case. If we look deeper, however, we discover thatHarris does most certainly use the scale charts and with the greatest skill andinnovative genius. Let's take the Six of Wands as an example:If we look to the column representing Wands (Knight scale) in table 5 and referto the Key scale #6, we find that the color for the Six of Wands should be clearpink rose. There is no (or very little) clear pink rose in the Six of Wands,however. As a matter of fact, the background is violet and purple, and the wandsthemselves are greenish yellow, outlined with reddish amber. Two of the wands onthe card are surmounted by winged solar disks with bright blue feathers and blueuraeus serpents outlined in yellow. Where did these colors come from?In chapter 14 [chap14.xhtml], I will discuss how each of the thirty-six smallcards represents one decan (period of ten degrees) of the zodiac.95[notes.xhtml#ft95] Each is also assigned a planet. The Six of Wands representsthe planet Jupiter in the second decan of Leo. If we look at Key scale #19 (Leo)on table 4, we find the colors yellow (greenish), deep purple, grey, and reddishamber. If we look at Key scale #21 (Jupiter), we find the colors violet, blue,rich purple, and bright blue rayed with yellow. A perfect match.Not all the cards are so easily analyzed. Instead of using the colorsseparately, as she does in the Six of Disks, Harris often blends two or morecolors that represent contending or inharmonious astrological or elementalaspects. This is more apparent in the higher-numbered cards, which representlower sephiroth on the Tree of Life and therefore characterize more imbalancedand polluted forces.No matter how difficult it may be to work out the method of the color madness ofevery card in the Thoth Tarot, we can be relatively confident that Lady Harriswas not careless or arbitrary in her selections.96 [notes.xhtml#ft96] Herpainstaking efforts to express in colors the complex and wonderful forces of theuniverse resulted in the creation of a unique and powerful meditative tool. Eachtime we work with the cards—each time we lay them out and allow our eyes todrink in their interwoven and interconnected colors—we silently activate thosesame connective webs of universal influences within ourselves."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ELEVENimages [images/kr.jpg]THE HOLY GUARDIAN ANGELHere at the remotest outpost if the divine empire lies a buried treasure.Because the inferior agrees with the superior, the genetic code of Kether andthe entire involving/evolving universe sleeps like a dormant seed inside each ifus. It takes a gardener to awaken and germinate this seed, and that gardener isthe Vau images [images/it.jpg] of the ineffable name, our Holy GuardianAngel.”97 [notes.xhtml#ft97]In Magick, Crowley wrote,The Single Supreme Ritual is the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation ofthe Holy Guardian Angel. It is the raising of the complete man in a verticalstraight line. Any deviation from this line tends to become black magic. Anyother operation is black magic.98 [notes.xhtml#ft98]“Oh my goodness!” I hear many of you gasping. “Guardian Angels! Black magic! Iknew this DuQuette fellow was up to no good! I just wanted to understand alittle more about the Thoth Tarot. Now we're talking about angels and blackmagic! What am I getting into? Where's it going to stop—human sacrifice?”Having come this far with me, I hope you are not harboring any such fears. Itwould be foolish indeed, because the subject of the Holy Guardian Angel is justthat—holy. It is directly related to the spiritual evolution of each and everyone of us, no matter what our religion or philosophy. It also has everything todo with the structure and behavior of tarot, especially the unique andmysterious status of the Princess court cards and the small cards, aces, andtens.Hang on to your hats. I'll try to make this short. But please, don't skip overthis part. It is the last and most important of the little bits of things youshould know before beginning your study of Aleister Crowley's Thoth Tarot.In 1888, S. L. MacGregor Mathers translated an unusual text, The Book of theSacred Magic of Abra-Melin the Mage as Delivered by Abraham the Jew unto His SonLamech, a Grimoire of the Fifteenth Century.99 [notes.xhtml#ft99] The originalmanuscript was first written down in Hebrew by the famous Qabalist and magician,Abraham the Jew, in 1458. It was housed in the Bibliotheque de l'Arsenal inParis and translated into French in the late seventeenth century. It is afascinating book of technical magic. The following is excerpted from my Angels,Demons, and Gods of the New Millennium.Abra-Melin reveals that each of us is linked to a spiritual being whom he callsthe Holy Guardian Angel. Until we have become spiritually wedded to this being,we are not fully equipped as human beings to rule the denizens of our lowernature or advance spiritually. The primary focus of the Abra-Melin operation isunion (Knowledge and Conversation) with one's Holy Guardian Angel. Until this isaccomplished, it is useless to even attempt to manipulate the circumstances oflife because we are as yet spiritually unprepared to adequately comprehend thenature of our true will, and so incompetent to exercise that will upon thecosmos. After Knowledge and Conversation is achieved the Angel becomes themagician's counselor and directs from a position of supreme wisdom allsubsequent magical activities.While the term “Holy Guardian Angel” used in this capacity appears to haveoriginated with the Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin the Mage, the concept of apersonal divine entity is unquestionably much older. Zoroaster100[notes.xhtml#ft100] writes of the Agathosdaimon, a personal guardian spirit whomust be contacted before any the urgic ceremony is initiated…. The Platonicphilosophers taught that between humanity and the gods there exists anintermediate class of spiritual beings called Daemonos. Each individual isassigned a personal daemon and it is the daemon, not the gods, who directlyhears and answers the prayers of our race. Socrates called his daemon “genius.”Spirit guides, who from prehistoric times have shepherded the shamanic visionsof every culture on earth, serve to demonstrate that Knowledge and Conversationof the Holy Guardian Angel is a fundamental and universal spiritual experience.Jesus said, “…no man cometh unto the Father but by me.” Krishna told Arjuna,“Only by single-minded devotion I may in this form be known and seen in reality,and also entered into.” Everywhere we look within the sacred writings andspiritual practices of the world's religions we find the basic theme of apersonal relationship with a spiritual being who is the representative of, orthe conduit to, a supreme (and perhaps impersonal) deity. So ingrained is thisbasic truth upon the collective unconscious of the race that we find it embeddeddeeply in our myths and fairy tales. It takes no stretch of the imagination tosee the H.G.A. as the prince who awakens with a kiss (Knowledge andConversation) the sleeping beauty (the unenlightened soul), and takes her to thepalace of his father the king (God), where the new couple will eventually becomeking and queen themselves (supreme enlightenment and re-absorption intogodhead)….The Holy Guardian Angel is more than the projected image of our perfected self,or the voice of our conscience; it is more than the innocent, inherent knowledgebetween right and wrong; it is more than the divine ear that hears us when welook to heaven and pray…“Oh God…if you just get me out of this, I'll never doanything so stupid again!” But what that “more than” is is difficult todiscuss.101 [notes.xhtml#ft101]Difficult indeed, but we must try to discuss it if we are going to understandhow this relates to tarot. Let's expand the fairytale analogy and look at thecharacters as if they were the letters images [images/it.jpg] YHVH and see wherethey might live on the Tree of Life. Please remember that every time I talkabout the Tree of Life, I am talking about more than just great cosmologicalabstractions. I'm talking about you and me. Each of us is an individual living,breathing Tree of Life. Every Tree of the four Qabalistic worlds, every path,every sephira has its counterpart in our own bodies, our own minds, our ownspirits, our own souls.Ultimately, all the characters in our fairytale are already living in the firstsephira, Kether (the ace of each suit). Of course, they will only realize thisin the timeless moment of ecstasy when they and all the units of consciousnessin the cosmos finally wake up and realize we are one big consciousness. Forpractical purposes of discussion, however, we can safely say that: * The ace is Kether, the Monad—the environment of supreme deity—above all concepts of duality, above the separation of male/female/King/Queen. * Our fairytale King is the Yod of YHVH, and lives in the second sephira, Chokmah. (His head, however, like the pointy little tip of the Hebrew letter Yod, really pokes up into Kether. But, as long as the King identifies himself as King, he is unaware of his more exalted identity and has convinced himself that he lives in Chokmah.) * The Queen is the first Hé in YHVH, and lives in the third sephira, Binah. * It is only fitting that this royal couple lives above the Abyss in the supernal triad. They unite and become one, as good couples should, and for a moment enjoy the ecstasy of being one (Kether). Then, after a cosmic cigarette, the King rolls over and goes to sleep. As the King snores away in Chokmah, the Queen becomes aware that, in this brief moment of ecstasy, she has become pregnant with twins. She eventually delivers. The two babies (a Prince and a Princess) plop out below the Abyss. The Prince doesn't fall too far from the supernal triad palace, but the Princess slides all the way to the bottom, Malkuth. * The young Prince is the Vau in YHVH. he's a bright boy and organizes a neatly ordered principality in sephiroth four through nine. These six sephiroth are often referred to in Qabalistic literature as the macrocosm, the greater world. Even though his principality is all six sephiroth of the macrocosm, our fairytale Prince's headquarters and main corporate office is in the sixth sephira, Tiphareth. (By the way, in our personal Tree of Life, the Prince is our own Holy Guardian Angel. Can you see where this is heading?) * The Princess is the final Hé in YHVH, and is literally trapped in the tenth sephira, Malkuth. In Qabalistic literature, Malkuth is often referred to as the microcosm, the lesser world. If the Princess were not sleeping most of the time, we would see that she is a very complicated and confused character. She, of course, is the daughter of the King and Queen, but, mysteriously, she belongs to an even younger generation than that of her brother, the Prince. As a matter of fact, even though she is closely related to the King, Queen, and Prince, her magical genes are so polluted and far enough removed from those of the rest of the family that, should she marry her brother, the Prince, it would not even be considered incest in a court of cosmic family law.You've probably guessed that you and I are the fairytale Princess. We are almostcompletely asleep to the larger spiritual reality and are restlessly thrashingaround in the bed of the material plane, trying to understand everything withour laughably inadequate senses, and explain it with our laughably inadequatelanguage. It's kind of depressing, isn't it?Nevertheless, we quite literally have an ace up our sleeves, because, low as thePrincess is on the Tree of Life—banished as she is from the supernal triad,separated as she is from her brother/lover the Prince in his macrocosmicprincipality, trapped as she in a microcosmic tomb of matter—the Princess is themost important character in our mystic fairytale.Her importance lies in the fact that she is the lowest of the low, and is thekey to the “general doctrine that the climax of the Descent into Matter is thesignal for the redintegration by Spirit”102 [notes.xhtml#ft102] that I mentionedbriefly in chapter 8 [chap8.xhtml]. No other character in our fairytale (exceptthe inscrutable singularity that is Kether/ace) has what the Princess has, thatis, a little bit of everything from the highest-high to the lowest-low. AsProclus wrote, “The heaven is in the earth, but after an earthly manner;…and theearth is in the heaven, but after a heavenly manner.”103 [notes.xhtml#ft103]The Holy Guardian Angel/Prince doesn't have any lowest of the low. He's stuck incosmic middle management and passionately needs a bit of the Princess' divineDNA if he is ever going to clone himself back to being a King. One kiss from thePrincess is all it will take. He will then wake up and realize he is King, whichwill cause the Princess to wake up more and realize she is his bride, the Queen.These two newlyweds will then unite in a cosmic orgasm that explodes and meltsaway all sense of separateness. In the truest sense, the King (Chokrnah) andQueen (Binah) are again annihilated in the one eternal moment they realize thatthey are not two, but one (Kether).From an alchemical point of view, the King and Queen's ecstatic dissolution wascaused by the universal solvent, vitriol (see page 135 [chap14.xhtml#page_135]).The Princess was the hidden stone and she certainly was buried in the interiorparts of the earth, and she certainly got herself rectified by marrying thePrince and becoming Queen, and so on ad infinitum.And does everyone live happily ever after? Well, after a fashion.Unfortunately, the cycle immediately repeats itself because, when the ecstaticafterglow of the realization of oneness wears off, the Queen once again findsherself pregnant. The King again falls asleep and awaits the Queen's lovingnudge. Of course, she will only be in the mood to give the old man the nudgewhen she is comforted by the fact that the royal children are once again safelyhome.This dynamic and somewhat incestuous love story is the secret of YHVH. It is theelectricity of creation—a divine alternating current coursing eternally in twodirections at the same time—from ace to Princess, from Princess to ace.I hope my little fairytale has helped you more clearly understand the dynamicsof this universal formula. Many of you may even think that I was being overlychildish in my narrative. Crowley's version is decidedly more adult andultimately far more informative. As we learned in chapter 7 [chap7.xhtml], hedelighted in using wild and blasphemous words and imagery to communicateperfectly wholesome spiritual concepts. * Crowley's Queen is the “Whore of Babalon, Mother of Abominations”; * Crowley's King is the “Beast, the All-father, Chaos”; * When Crowley's King and Queen unite, it is “Babalon Riding the Beast”; * Crowley's returning new-wedded Prince and Princess are (is) the “Blood of the Saints”; * Crowley's Queen does not just rejoice at the homecoming of the royal children, she throws a cosmic party and becomes “drunk of the Blood of the Saints”; Instead of a Queen who politely nudges her King awake to make love, we have Babalon the Great in her whoredom, awakening the “poison of the Eld” of the All-Father, and then once again “mounting the Beast.”I again remind you that, when we talk about these characters, we are talkingabout aspects of ourselves and levels of consciousness most of us have yet toexperience. If we could wake up and see the big picture, we would realize thatwe are at once the ace, King, Queen, Prince, and Princess of this cosmicfairytale. But we are not awake. As Rabbi Ben Clifford says,The you that you think is you is not you. It is a dream you. In fact, the youthat you think is you is a dreamer inside a dreamer inside a dreamer inside adreamer. You are the King of the universe who has fallen asleep and is dreaminghe is the Queen who has fallen asleep and is dreaming she is the Prince who hasfallen asleep and is dreaming he is a sleeping Princess.104 [notes.xhtml#ft104]In a most personal and intimate way, each of us is the sleeping Princess. Eachof us waits as a bride-to-be for the kiss of our Prince (our Holy GuardianAngel) and the return to our spiritual estate. Recall Crowley's quote at thebeginning of this chapter.The Single Supreme Ritual is the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation ofthe Holy Guardian Angel. It is the raising of the complete man in a verticalstraight line. Any deviation from this line tends to become black magic. Anyother operation is black magic.The vertical straight line is the raising of our consciousness from Malkuth—10(the sephira of the microcosm) to Tiphareth—6 (the central sephira of themacrocosm). Until this is accomplished, until each of us has united ourmicrocosm with the macrocosm of the Holy Guardian Angel, we not playing with afull deck. We are not balanced enough to know good from evil, and all ouractions tend to become “black magic.”Crowley devised a magical word to illustrate knowledge of and conversation withthe Holy Guardian Angel. He mentions it several times in The Book of Thoth andLady Harris incorporates it graphically in the trump card the Chariot. It is aword that symbolizes the union of the numbers five and six—five representing themicrocosm (the little world centered in Malkuth, you and me, the Princess); sixrepresenting the macrocosm, (the big world centered in Tiphareth, the HolyGuardian Angel). The magical word is ABRAHADABRA. It is composed of five As amidsix other letters.KING OR KNIGHT? QABALISTIC ROMANCEBefore we get too far away from our fairytale, I need to bring up something veryimportant. The four royal characters in the above story are called King, Queen,Prince, and Princess. The court cards of the original Golden Dawn deck weretitled exactly the same. Each suit had a King on a horse, a Queen on a throne, aPrince in a chariot, and a standing Princess. With only one exception, the courtcards of the Thoth Tarot are titled and positioned the same way. The exceptionis, Crowley uses the title Knight instead of King. His reason for doing so is“Qabalistic Romance.” Simply put, a knight is sexier than a king.In the imagery of cosmic chivalry, the knight on horseback wins his queen, theold king's daughter, and replaces the old king on the throne. If we were toproject this dynamic upon our fairytale, the Knight would be the character whowins and makes love to the Queen, and a King is the guy who afterward turnsaround and falls asleep. Crowley considered the more active, virile concept ofthe Knight to be the most appropriate title and character for the court cardthat represents the Yod in YHVH.While I'm on the subject of sexy tarot cards, I would surely be remiss in mypledge to introduce all the little bits of things you should know beforebeginning your study of the Thoth Tarot if I didn't spend a little time on animportant subject that dominated a great deal of Crowley's magical life andinfluenced profoundly the nature of the Thoth Tarot—sex magick.SEX MAGICK, TAROT, AND THE HOLY GUARDIAN ANGELThe Magick of Thelema tells us thatAl Magick is sexual. Indeed, all life is sexual. It is either overt or implied,invoked or directed, stored or released. The Mass of the Roman Catholic Churchis every bit as much a pantomime of the sex act as the “Great Rite” of thewitches. The real question is “what is sex symbolic of?”105 [notes.xhtml#ft105]What do you think of when you hear the words “sex magick''? Maybe you picturewild orgies where people dress up in bizarre costumes and intone spooky chantswhile they perform unspeakable sexual acts upon each other and an assortment ofother creatures and inanimate objects? Perhaps you imagine people being abusedby a diabolical magician and his minions in order to evoke evil spirits. Youmight even think that you can join a sex magick cult where (even if you do notpossess even a minimum level of intelligence, attractiveness, social skills, orcharm) you will be rewarded with eager and willing sexual partners. Dream on!For nearly thirty years, I have been an active member and officer of oneCrowley's own magical societies, Ordo Templi Orientis. The O.T.O. is the largestThelemic order in the world. It is a fraternal and religious organization thatprovides degree initiations and engages in various social and publishingendeavors. Magically, however, the Order exists primarily to protect andperpetuate a particular magical secret of great potential efficacy. The degreestructure of the Order is designed to prepare its most serious and tenaciousinitiates and provide them with the tools to discover this secret and use itsafely and effectively. This supreme secret is a particular technique of sexualmagick. It is held sacred and secret by members of the Sovereign Sanctuary ofthe Gnosis (the Order's Ninth Degree), whose duty it is to use the secret forthe benefit of his or her spiritual evolution.I know it will be a painful revelation for some of you to learn that none of thefanciful scenes of erotic excess that I've described above even remotelyresemble anything that takes place at any O.T.O. degree initiation or any otherofficial ceremony or activity, public or private. The Order does not read itsmembers' diaries, monitor their magical or sexual lives, or violate theirbodies. In other words, you may learn the principles of sex magick in theO.T.O., but you'll have to practice on your own.Now you may be asking, if the world's largest sex magick organization isn't anorgy cult, then what is sex magick about? My good friend Donald Michael Kraiggives one very excellent definition: ‘'A variety of techniques which harness theenergies raised during sexual activity and direct them to fulfill the desires ofthe people practicing sex magick.”106 [notes.xhtml#ft106]The key word in Don's definition is “desires.” What the magician desires istechnically called “the object of the operation.” Desire spells the differencebetween an ill-conceived attempt to bewitch your neighbor's cow and theattainment of perfect spiritual liberation. I bring all this up in this chapterbecause nothing should be more ardently desired than the Holy Guardian Angel. Itshould not surprise anyone that the experience of knowledge of and conversationwith one's H.G.A. is often described as being exquisitely sexual.Most everyone knows the ecstasy of orgasm. In that golden moment, our self isannihilated just like the consciousness of the King and Queen in our fairytale.In that timeless moment, there is no difference between you and everything elsein the universe—including (potentially) the object of the operation (yourheart's desire). Can't you see how, by working like a disciplined yogi with theforces and energies that lead up to that timeless moment, a person can literallybecome one with the object of their desire and then gestate and eventually givebirth to it? This is technical magick of the highest order and should not beidentified in any way with the prurient shenanigans of sex cults or clubs.Human sexuality is only one very narrow expression of this sexual alchemy. Theformula is truly universal and its mechanics are at work at all levels ofexistence. It is the magick that turns energy into matter, sunlight into gold,you and me into God.And so ends Part I of this book. I now would like to pause and congratulate youfor enduring all these little bits of things I thought you should know beforebeginning your study of Aleister Crowley's Thoth Tarot. I realize that, formany, it has been an ordeal. I have done my best to make things as clear as Iwould have wanted them presented at the beginning of my studies, but I'm surethere are those who may still feel hopelessly confused. I hope you willpersevere and refer often to the material in Part I and the definitions in theglossary in chapter 21 [chap21.xhtml] as you study the next section, which dealswith the individual cards."},{"pageContent":"PART IIThe Cards"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWELVEimages [images/kr.jpg]INTRODUCTION TO THE CARDSI know enough about the works of Aleister Crowley to know that it would beunwise for me to presume to interpret him. There is more than enough Crowleymaterial available to allow Crowley to explain Crowley. Finding that materialwhen you need it, however, can be a problem.1 [notes.xhtml#f2t1]Now that we are familiar with many of the little bits of things you should knowbefore beginning your study of Aleister Crowley's Thoth Tarot, I think we areabout ready to examine the cards themselves without the distraction of having todigress repeatedly into fundamental discussions of Qabalah, Thelema, alchemy, orEnochiana. Knowing the place whereon I standest is holy ground, it is with nosmall measure of trepidation that I begin my comments on the individual cards. Ihave tried to the best of my ability to put off the sandals of presumption andkeep my personal speculations and theories to an absolute minimum.If I should state, for instance, that the goddess of the Adjustment card is theFool's girlfriend, or that the Devil is God as misunderstood by the wicked, orthat the Magus is cursed so that all his words are distorted and misunderstood,it will be because, somewhere in his voluminous writings, Crowley has said so. Imake no apologies for quoting Crowley liberally, and quoting him often, from anumber of texts including The Book of Thoth, The Heart of the Master,2[notes.xhtml#f2t2] Magick, Book IV, The Equinox, Konx Om Pax, Orpheus, andletters between Crowley and Harris. I have taken great pains to identify andreference all such quotes. That being said, I must remind the reader that notevery aspect of the Thoth Tarot is new or revolutionary. Spending too much timeand energy searching for secret Crowleyisms hidden in every curious brushstrokeor printing flaw is more often a symptom of mental instability than spiritualrevelation.The fact is that the format and fundamental images of most of the individualcards of the Thoth Tarot are not the invention of Aleister Crowley. As a memberof the Golden Dawn, Crowley was encouraged to paint his own personal deck usingspecific images and colors outlined in Order documents. Lady Harris possessedthe written descriptions and was also familiar with the published deck paintedby Pamela Coleman Smith under the direction of Arthur Edward Waite. Indiscussing each card, I will describe the original Golden Dawn design and, asmuch as possible, point out similarities and differences.THE MAJOR AND MINOR ARCANASWhen we break the seal and open a new deck of tarot cards we usually discoverthat they are neatly organized and ordered. The first twenty-two cards arenumbered with roman numerals 0–XXI and are called the Major (or Greater) Arcana.The remaining fifty-six cards are called the Minor (or Lesser) Arcana and aredivided into four suits. The suits are usually ordered Wands, Cups, Swords, andDisks. Each suit contains fourteen cards consisting of four court cards (Knight,Queen, Prince, and Princess)3 [notes.xhtml#f2t3] and ten small cards (acethrough 10).That is how most decks of tarot cards are arranged when they first come from themanufacturer. However, the true hierarchy of the tarot would have them arrangedas I show below. (The logic behind these divisions will soon become clear.) * The twenty-two trumps ordered 0–XXI * The four aces ordered Wands, Cups, Swords, and Disks; * The sixteen court cards ordered by suit (Wands, Cups, Swords, and Disks) and by title (Knight, Queen, Prince, and Princess); * The thirty-six small cards ordered by suit (Wands, Cups, Swords, and Disks) and by number (2-10).From a Qabalistic point of view, the relationship between the two Arcanas iscomplex, if not downright inscrutable. I could digress at this point intohundreds of pages of debate over which Qabalistic world plays host to whichArcana,4 [notes.xhtml#f2t4] but I intend to spare us that detour. Crowley said,“the Tarot will lose all its vitality for one who allows himself to beside-tracked by its pedantry.”5 [notes.xhtml#f2t5] I couldn't agree more, solet's try to make it easy on ourselves.A simple (if not altogether accurate) way of looking at the two Arcanas is byprojecting them upon the pentagram.In figure 22, the Major Arcana (the twenty-two trumps or atus) represents spiritand is placed on the top point of the pentagram. Each trump is, in essence, adivine personage “possessing its own private, personal and particularUniverse.”6 [notes.xhtml#f2t6] Each presents an aspect—a facet of supremereality. Like the element spirit, the influence of the trumps pervades alllevels of consciousness and creation—attracting, repelling, connecting, andseparating the infinite elemental combinations.images [images/vg.jpg]FIGURE 22. THE PENTAGRAM OF THE MAJOR AND MINOR ARCANAS. THE MAJOR ARCANA RULESTHE MINOR ARCANA IN THE SAME WAY THAT SPIRIT RULES THE FOUR ELEMENTS.The Minor Arcana represents the four elemental arms of the pentagram that spirit(the Major Arcana) simultaneously unites and separates. The cards of the MinorArcana are not divine personages, but “primarily sub-Elements, parts of the‘Blind Forces' under the Demiourgos, Tetragrammaton.”7 [notes.xhtml#f2t7]I know this is a lot to absorb, especially for those of you who are notparticularly interested in the details of Qabalistic thought. Perhaps all thiswill be easier to understand if we look at it this way: * Each trump is a world all its own—one one-twenty-second facet of the totality of consciousness—the ultimate spiritual and cosmological reality; * Each of the trumps can be thought of as having an entire set of fifty-six Minor Arcana cards that it rules and with which it executes its particular aspect of influence.We could argue quite correctly that there are really 1,232 (22 × 56) tarot cardsin a complete deck; fifty-six cards of the Minor Arcana dutifully playing outtheir elemental roles in twenty-two different, but intimately connected,drama/comedies written and directed by each of the twenty-two trumps. In TheBook of Thoth, Crowley uses the Three of Disks, Work, as an example of how thisplays out:The Three of Disks belonging to the High Priestess or the Lovers might representthe establishment of an oracle like that of Delphi. The Hierophant's Three ofDisks might point to the construction of a cathedral. The Tower's Three of Disksperhaps indicating the massing of a standing army. The ideas that such pairingsevoke can be an infinite source of meditation, and an invaluable exercise foranyone wishing to use the cards for divination.8 [notes.xhtml#f2t8]In the pages that follow, I briefly discuss each of the seventy-eight cards ofthe Thoth Tarot. I will focus primarily upon the magical and spiritualtraditions that gave birth to it as a tarot entity, and upon demonstrating howthe various astrological and Qabalistic components blend to create each card'sunique character. (For divinatory meanings and Crowley's method of divination,see chapter 20 [chap20.xhtml].) Wherever possible, I also include excerpts ofletters between Harris and Crowley concerning the card. I find theseparticularly interesting.Now on to the seventy-eight cards of the Thoth Tarot. We will start with theMajor Arcana."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THIRTEENimages [images/im.jpg]INTRODUCTION TO THE MAJOR ARCANAAll these old letters of my Book are aright but images [images/87.jpg] is notthe Star. This is also secret: my prophet shall reveal it to the wise.9[notes.xhtml#f2t9]Nobody really knows where tarot cards originated. Obviously, they could not haveexisted as cards before the invention of paper. As a matter of fact, we cannotwith any degree of certainty trace them any further back than northern Italy inthe first half of the fifteenth century, where they were called carte da trionfi(cards of the triumph) and used to play a game similar to modern bridge. Later,in the 1530s, the cards became known as tarocchi (singular form tarocco, meaning“tarot”).Early examples displayed imagery that inspired the imaginations of theRenaissance elite—ancient gods, heroes, virtues, vices, and principals enthronedin chariots and “trumping” one another by order of importance as part of a greattriumphal procession. These were later supplemented with other figures,including mystical images from the prophetic books of the Old and NewTestaments. Still later, Masonic concepts like the four public and privatevirtues of Temperance, Fortitude (Strength), Justice, and Prudence (Lovers?) allmake their appearance in tarot decks.THE ORDERING OF THE TRUMPSFor the most part, the individual trump cards of the Thoth Tarot should beimmediately recognizable to anyone who is familiar with the traditional imagesof tarot. The Aeon is the most striking exception.In the Thoth Tarot, the twenty-two trumps are formally referred to as “Atus ofTahuti.” According to Crowley, “Atu” was Ancient Egyptian for “house” or “key”;Tahuti is the God Thoth (the Egyptian Hermes, or Mercury). He also informs usthat the word “atout” is short for the French phrase, bon á tout, meaning “goodfor anything,” or what card players call a “wild card.”The earliest decks did not have tides printed on the trumps themselves, and thenumber of trumps and their ordering differed. As early as the 1490s, however, abasic collection of twenty-two characters and images, ordered more or less as wefind them in modern decks, appeared as the standard model throughout Europe.There is no real evidence that this standardization was the result of anythingmore occult or mysterious than the natural congealing of the conventions of apopular game. Nevertheless, that phenomenon in itself may have profoundimplications concerning how the human mind is hardwired to respond to archetypalimages.In a time when artificial images were limited to rare paintings, statuary, andarchitecture, the introduction of a portable pack of colorful images that couldbe viewed and enjoyed at one's leisure for hours on end must have had as muchimpact upon the psyche of fifteenth-century Europe as photography and motionpictures had upon that of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.With one exception, the Atus, or trumps, of the Thoth Tarot conform to the Tarotde Marsielles sequence, which is the same as that originally established by thedeck of Catelin Geoffroy in 1557.10 [notes.xhtml#f2t10] The Thoth Tarot alsofollows, with one exception, the Golden Dawn's secret scheme of attributingcertain Hebrew letters and their corresponding elemental, planetary, or zodiacalattributions. That one exception has been, and continues to be, the source ofmuch discussion and argument among students of modern occultism. In the next fewpages, I will do my best to explain why the Thoth Tarot attributes the Hebrewletter Tzaddi (images [images/87.jpg]) to the fourth trump, the Emperor, and theHebrew letter Hé (images [images/im1.jpg]) to the seventeenth trump, the Starinstead of the other way around. It is all because of one sentence of one verseof The Book of the Law: “All these old letters of my Book are aright; but images[images/87.jpg] is not the Star.”11 [notes.xhtml#f2t11]Don't feel badly if, at first, you find what follows difficult to understand.Lady Harris was quite frank with Crowley about her confusion.Also I don't feel you have made it clear about Tzaddi—The Emperor. Can't youhave a diagram? I have been reading your book to Ann Christie in the evenings &altho she is very interested she could not understand your book and I am notsure I did in the end. It will be a point about which there will be the mostargument. Is there any reason for the 2 loops except secrecy? Sure! & if not whynot undo the loop & is the Emperor to be numbered 17 or IV or 4 or 17 ditto Staralso Strength XI and Justice VIII. I expect I have still got it all wrong but ifI have, you must be clearer because I am only just below sub-normalintelligence. A bientot.12 [notes.xhtml#f2t12]I wish we had Crowley's response to the above letter. It might have beensomething like his commentary on this verse later published in The Law Is forAll:I see no harm in revealing the mystery of Tzaddi to “the wise”; others willhardly understand my explanations. Tzaddi is the letter of the Emperor, theTrump IV, and Hé is the Star, the Trump XVII. Aquarius and Aries are thereforecounterchanged, revolving on the pivot of Pisces, just as in the Trumps VIII andXI, Leo and Libra, do about Virgo. This last revelation makes our Tarotattributions sublimely, perfectly, flawlessly symmetrical.13 [notes.xhtml#f2t13]Without illustrations, this explanation is rather hard to picture. The Book ofThoth contains diagrams and tables that do not always agree with each other.What follows is my best attempt to sort things out.The adepts of the Golden Dawn, (working from existing and or innovated esotericdoctrine) assigned Hebrew letters to each of the trumps. Among many otherthings, these twenty-two Hebrew letters also represent the three primitiveelements, seven planets, and twelve signs of the zodiac.TABLE 6. THE TRADITIONAL SEQUENCE USING THE TITLES OF THE THOTH TAROT AND GOLDENDAWN ATTRIBUTESimages [images/100.jpg]With only two exceptions (as indicated in table 6 by the double arrows), theorder of the twenty-two trumps neatly follows the sequential order of thetwenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. The exceptions to this otherwise tidyarrangement relate to the traditional positioning of two trumps, 8 (Adjustment,Justice in older decks) and 11 (Lust, Strength in older decks). If we were tofollow the natural order of the Hebrew alphabet, Adjustment would be assignedthe ninth letter, Teth (which represents the zodiacal sign of Leo), and Lustwould be assigned the twelth Hebrew letter, Lamed (which represents the zodiacalsign of Libra). This is not the case, and the adepts of the Golden Dawn made thecorrection.This is easier to see in table 7, which shows only the zodiacal trumps. Noticehow, by making Strength (Lust) trump number 8 and assigning it the Hebrew letterTeth, and by making Justice (Adjustment) trump number 11 and assigning it theHebrew letter Lamed, the Golden Dawn arrangement restores the natural order tothe signs of the zodiac and to the Hebrew alphabet.As tidy and logical as this switch is, it nevertheless disturbs the traditionalsequence of trumps, and this bothered many Golden Dawn members, includingCrowley. The Thoth Tarot follows the Golden Dawn model in that it assignsTeth/Leo to the Lust card and Lamed/Libra to the Adjustment card, but it retainsthe traditional sequence of Lust as the eleventh and Adjustment as the eighthtrump.TABLE 7. GOLDEN DAWN ARRANGEMENT: THE NATURAL SEQUENCE OF THE SIGNS OF THEZODIAC AND THE HEBREW ALPHABET RESTOREDimages [images/101.jpg]If we were to project this change upon the belt of the zodiac, it would be as ifa twist or loop is formed around the sign of Virgo, changing the natural orderof signs from Leo-Virgo-Libra to Libra-Virgo-Leo.Figure 23 shows the natural order of the signs of the zodiac; figure 24 showsthe Leo/Libra twist.images [images/102.jpg]FIGURE 23. NATURAL ORDER OF THE ZODIACAL BELT.images [images/103.jpg]FIGURE 24. ZODIACAL BELT WITH A TWIST. TETH (LEO) AND LAMED (LIBRA) ARESWITCHED. NOTE THAT VIRGO RETAINS ITS POSITION.This arrangement leaves us with a curious and somewhat imbalanced diagram of thezodiacal belt, but it didn't seem to bother Crowley, at least not until shortlyafter twelve noon on April 8, 1904. He was in the middle of receiving the firstchapter of The Book of the Law in his hotel room in Cairo. Aiwass, speaking forthe Goddess Nuit, had just dictated the words, “Invoke me under my stars! Loveis the law, love under will. Nor let the fools mistake love; for there are loveand love. There is the dove, and there is the serpent. Choose ye well. He, myprophet, hath chosen, knowing the law of the fortress, and the great mystery ofthe House of God.”14 [notes.xhtml#f2t14]When Crowley “heard” the reference to “the fortress” and “the House of God”(alternate titles to trump XVI, the Tower), a question arose in his mindconcerning the general correctness of the ordering of the tarot trumps.Instantly, his question was answered, when Aiwass dictated the next line: “Althese old letters of my Book are aright but is images [images/87.jpg] not theStar. This is also secret: my prophet shall reveal it to the wise.”15[notes.xhtml#f2t15]This comment puzzled Crowley. If Tzaddi was not the Star, then what card was?And what Hebrew letter should be attributed to the Star card? The answer wassome time in coming, but when it did come, there was no doubt in Crowley's mindthat he had figured it out. Tzaddi was the Emperor.This card is attributed to the letter Tzaddi, and it refers to the sign of Ariesin the Zodiac. This sign is ruled by Mars, and therein the Sun is exalted. Thesign is thus a combination of energy in its most material form with the idea ofauthority. The sign TZ or TS implies this in the original, ono-matopoetic formof language. It is derived from Sanskrit roots meaning Head and Age, and isfound to-day in words like Cæsar, Tsar, Sirdar, Senate, Senior, Signor, Señor,Seigneur. 16 [notes.xhtml#f2t16]The Emperor's old letter was Hé. It would now be attributed to the Star. Hé isthe letter for both female components of YHVH (the Supernal Mother Hé of Binah,and unredeemed Daughter Hé of Malkuth) and a perfect representation of the StarGoddess depicted on Atu XVII. Why hadn't someone thought of this before?Of course, Crowley was not satisfied with just knowing what the switch was; hehad to find a more esoteric and technical reason why Tzaddi was not the Star.As we see in table 8 and figure 25, switching the trumps that represent theHebrew Letters Hé and Tzaddi upsets the natural order of the signs of the zodiacon the opposite side of the zodiac, as if another loop had formed on the belt ofthe zodiac that twisted around the sign of Pisces and changed the natural orderfrom Aquarius-Pisces-Aries to Aries-Pisces-Aquarius.TABLE 8. CROWLEY ARRANGEMENT: THE NATURAL SEQUENCE OF SIGNS ARRANGED TOACCOMMODATE THE NEW ORDERimages [images/104.jpg]images [images/105.jpg]FIGURE 25. ZODIACAL BELT WITH TWO TWISTS.TETH (LEO) AND LAMED (LIBRA) ARESWITCHED BY THE GOLDEN DAWN; EMPEROR (TZADDI) AND STAR (HÉ) ARE SWITCHED BYCROWLEY.It is likely that there will always be confusion and controversy over thismatter. It doesn't help that Crowley offers us conflicting diagrams andstatements in The Book of Thoth. The most vexing are: * Table XX, which assigns Aquarius to the Emperor and Aries to the Star; * The last paragraph of his comments on the Emperor (page 78 [chap11.xhtml#page_78]), where he talks of the path of the Emperor as if it held its old position on the Tree of Life, joining sephira 2, Chokmah, with sephira 6, Tiphareth.Whether this is because of inevitable typographical errors or because ofCrowley's reticence to form a strict doctrine around any particular verse of TheBook of the Law, will probably remain a mystery, but here's a quick referencethat I would loved to have had at the beginning of my study of the Thoth Tarot.It may not conform to every statement and diagram in The Book of Thoth, but itis the most consistent summary I could create.Trump 4 is the Emperor * The zodiac sign assigned to the Emperor is Aries; * The Hebrew letter for the Emperor isimages [images/87.jpg] Tzaddi (and everythingimages [images/87.jpg] Tzaddi represents); * On the Tree of Life, the Emperor is found on path 28, which joins the seventh sephira, Netzach, to the ninth sephira, Yesod.Trump 8 is Adjustment * The zodiac sign assigned to Adjustment is Libra; * The Hebrew letter for Adjustment isimages [images/106.jpg] Lamed (and everything Lamed represents); * On the Tree of Life, Adjustment is found on path 22, which joins the fifth sephira, Geburah, to the sixth sephira, Tiphareth.Trump 11 is Lust * The zodiac sign assigned to Lust is Leo; * The Hebrew letter for Lust isimages [images/108.jpg] Teth (and everything Teth represents); * On the Tree of Life, Lust is found on path 19, which joins the fourth sephira, Chesed, to the fifth sephira, Geburah.Trump 17 is the Star * The zodiac sign assigned to the Star is Aquarius; * The Hebrew letter for The Star isimages [images/109.jpg] Hé (and everything Hé represents); * On the Tree of Life, Hé is found on path 15, which joins the second sephira, Chokmah to the sixth sephira, Tiphareth.THE DIVISION OF THE TRUMPSThere are near infinite ways the twenty-two trumps can be divided and combinedfor meditative and instructive purposes. The most obvious, of course, are thedivisions by three elemental, seven planetary, and twelve zodiacal cards.Another very popular method of division places the Fool at the top of three rowsof seven cards, ordered consecutively. Each of the three rows can represent someaspect or quality of character or consciousness. The cards are then consideredas seven columns of three cards, each relating in some way to each other. Forexample, the first column would have the Magus at the top, Adjustment in themiddle and the Devil on the bottom, perhaps suggestive of some cosmic truthrelating to the manifest nature of the Magus, or some such spiritual lesson.Personally, I believe that any way we organize or combine the cards is alegitimate meditative exercise. After all, the trumps are a universal alphabetof images and, no matter how we throw them together, they are bound to spellsomething.Buried in The Book of Thoth, as the last paragraph of his comments on the HighPriestess, Crowley reveals a most remarkable secret concerning the fundamentalnature of the twenty-two trumps:It is especially to be observed that the three consecutive letters, Gimel,Daleth, Hé (Atu II, III, XVII) show the Feminine Symbol (Yin) in three formscomposing a Triune Goddess. This Trinity is immediately followed by the threecorresponding and complementary Fathers, Vau, Tzaddi, Yod (Atu IV, V, IX). TheTrumps 0 and I are hermaphrodite. The remaining fourteen Trumps represent thesePrimordial Quintessences of Being in conjunction, function, or manifestation.17[notes.xhtml#f2t17]If the above leaves you somewhat unexcited let me get out my Crowlese-Englishdictionary and attempt to translate.Eight trumps (the Fool, the Magus, the High Priestess, the Empress, the Emperor,the Hierophant, the Hermit, and the Star) are a special class of trump. They areprimordial quintessences of being. (Just for fun, let's call these eightfirst-class trumps.)These first-class trumps are divided by gender into three categories: 1. The Fool and the Magus are hermaphrodite; 2. The High Priestess, the Empress, and the Star show the feminine symbol in three forms; 3. The Emperor, the Hierophant, and the Hermit show the masculine symbol in three forms. These three correspond and are complementary to the High Priestess, the Empress, and the Star (though Crowley is not clear how they are paired).Each of the remaining fourteen trumps (let's call them second-class trumps)represents one or more of the first-class trumps, and they do so in one of threeways: 1. As an expression of the character and behavior of the first-class trump when it is combined with one or more of its seven fellows; 2. As an expression of how the first-class trump functions; 3. As an expression of how the first-class trump manifests.Crowley doesn't give us any examples and leaves us to our own devices as to howto apply this doctrine, but just a few minutes with the cards can provide muchfood for thought. For example (and the most obvious), the second-class trump theLovers can be studied as the expression of the character and behavior offirst-class trump the Empress when combined with first-class trump the Emperor(or for that matter with the High Priestess and the Hermit).This exercise, and many more you are likely to discover in your tarot career,will naturally become more effective (and more fun) as you become more familiarwith the cards. In my opinion, the most important thing to keep in mind is thatnone of the trumps (indeed, no single tarot card) stands alone. They are allintimately interconnected. The Major Arcana is one master play with twenty-twomodular acts that can be performed in an infinite numbers of ways.That being said, I think it's time we bring up the curtain and take a look atour cast of characters. Before we do, however, I would like to remind you thatthe tarot tells a story, and like a play or a movie, it is best to see it firstfrom beginning to end to appreciate its message. Once you are familiar with theactors and plot, you can skip around to examine your favorite scenes andcharacters more closely. I therefore strongly suggest that the first time youread the following sections concerning the individual cards, you do so straightthrough and in the order they are presented.The tarot's story is your story. Savor it.

I wish I couldpaint in crystals.21 [notes.xhtml#f2t21]—Harris to Crowley date uncertain.This may seem odd to you, but I am going to open my remarks about the firsttarot trump, the Fool, by quoting what Crowley wrote about the last trump, theUniverse:In the card itself there is consequently a glyph of the completion of the GreatWork in its highest sense, exactly as the Atu of the Fool symbolizes itsbeginning. The Fool is the negative issuing into manifestation; the Universe isthat manifestation, its purpose accomplished, ready to return. The twenty cardsthat lie between these two exhibit the Great Work and its agents in variousstages.22 [notes.xhtml#f2t22]In essence, there are not really twenty-two trumps, there is only one—the Fool.Al the other trumps live inside (and issue from) the Fool. Of all seventy-eighttarot cards, none is more revered and misunderstood. In The Book of ThothCrowley devotes over twenty-four pages to this card alone and, in doing so,gives us a whirlwind tour of the greatest hits of Greek, Roman, Hindu, Hebrew,pagan, and Christian mythology.The most familiar image of the Fool is that of a young vagabond, his headwreathed with laurel or ivy. He holds a white rose and wears a motley coat. Overhis shoulder rests a staff, at the end of which is tied a bag or satchel. A dogor a crocodile sometimes nips at his feet. He strolls mindlessly toward the edgeof a high mountain cliff, his eyes cast irresponsibly skyward. He still has onefoot upon the earth, the other poised to take the fateful step into the abyss.Lady Harris's Fool is different. This Fool has both feet planted unfirmly inair!Why is the Fool such a mysterious and awesome character? Isn't he just anothermediaeval cast member jesting to the Emperor, Empress, and Hierophant? Perhaps.That picture certainly fits many of the traditional images of this card. From amystical point of view, however, the Fool is much more (actually, much, muchless). The Fool propounds the ultimate riddle. Creation and the meaning of lifeare an incomprehensible joke. The Fool is more than God. The Fool is the“nothing” we refer to when we say, “Nothing created God. Nothing is beyond God.Nothing is greater than God.”The Fool is perfectly empty-headed, for if therewere anything inside, his innocence would be destroyed.As the first trump it is only logical that the Fool be considered Key number 1.He is not, however, Key number 1. He is Key number 0. This is the Fool's firstand greatest trick—creating the one (and consequently everything else) out ofnothing.“That's crazy!” your rational mind says; and your rational mind is correct—up toa point. It doesn't make sense that something can come out of nothing. If wewanted to personify the irrational concept of something coming from nothing,however, what better mascot could we choose than that of an idiot who makes nosense—a fool?I have seen several early drafts that Crowley rejected. To my absolute delight,I discovered that two of them bore the unmistakable image of Harpo Marx. Howperfect! In Marx Brothers' films, Harpo was the archetypal fool. Even his namebetrayed his identity. Not only was he the girl-chasing clown who made fools ofall the straightlaced and uptight characters, he did it all without saying aword. He was silent like the very mythological characters from whom the Fool isconstructed; silent like Harpocrates, the Greek god of innocence; silent likeDionysus when he was asked by king Pentheus “What is Truth?”; silent like Christstanding before Pilate when he was asked the exact same question.The Fool of the Thoth Tarot retains the familiar elements of traditional decks,but boldly asserts that the character we are dealing with is none other than theinscrutable supreme deity of every age and culture. He is the pagan Green Man ofspring; Parsifal, the pure fool who wins the Holy Grail; Hoor-Pa-Kraat, theinnocent Egyptian lord of silence, who treads upon the crocodile god Sebek, theDevourer. His wild eyes, horns, tiger, pine cones, grapes, and ivy show him tobe the secret essence of the cosmos worshipped for centuries as Dionysus.Dionysus Zagreus, the horned son of Zeus, and Bacchus Diphues, the drunken andmad omni-sexual god of divine ecstasy.Lady Harris's Fool is a cornucopia of sacred images, many of which revealthemselves only after long meditation (and the aid of a magnifying glass). Hebursts into midair of existence from behind three swirling rings that issue fromand return to his heart. These are the three veils of negativity (Ain, Ain Soph,and Ain Soph Aur)23 [notes.xhtml#f2t23] that Qabalists teach gave birth to thesingularity of creation. His satchel is filled with the entire universe in theform of planetary and zodiacal coins.The Fool is the Holy Spirit itself. The dove, symbol of the Holy Spirit; thebutterfly, symbol of transformation; winged globe, symbol of Mercurial air; andthe Egyptian vulture-goddess Mauf24 [notes.xhtml#f2t24] pour from the Holy Grailin the Fool's right hand. Like the Virgin Mary, Maut became impregnated by thespirit (breath) of the wind. “The whole picture,” Crowley tells us, “is a glyphof the creative light.”25 [notes.xhtml#f2t25]With that in mind, I would finally like to draw the reader's attention to theimage of the Sun covering the groin area of the Fool, and the almost invisibleimage of the Moon directly above the head of the crocodile. Between these twoprimary symbols of male and female are what Crowley describes as “twin infantsembracing on the middle spiral. Above them hangs the benediction of threeflowers in one.”26 [notes.xhtml#f2t26]We can only speculate on the meanings of these symbols. In my opinion, it ishighly likely that they allude, at least in part, to certain aspects of sexualalchemy that Crowley was not inclined to dwell upon in detail in publishedmaterial. Certainly, the powers and unlimited potential of the generativeprocesses might fall appropriately into the category of “the creative light.”Other speculations aside, here at the very beginning of our study of the othercards I ask that you not lose sight of the obvious fact that the Fool's genitalsare hidden by the Sun.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------ATU I THE MAGUSThe Magus of PowerPlanetary Trump of MercuryOriginal Design: A fair youth with winged helmet and heels, equipped as aMagician, displays his art.

This willbe beautifully printed with the Magician reproduced perfectly as a card, theright size & engraved on it.”29 [notes.xhtml#f2t29]—Harris to Crowley May 11,1941.Before I discuss the symbolism of the Magus card, I have to set to rest theabsurd rumor that Crowley intended there to be three Magus cards in the ThothTarot. By no stretch of imagination did Crowley intend to create twenty-fourtrumps or an eighty-card tarot deck. Any theory or suggestion to the contrarywould have him spinning in his grave (if he had one) and displays a profoundignorance of Crowley and The Book of Thoth. Crowley approved only one Magus cardfor inclusion in the Thoth Tarot. It is the image reproduced in The Book ofThoth and is the only Magus in the deck currently included in decks published byU.S. Games Systems, Inc.The mystery of the three magi of the Thoth Tarot, is no mystery at all. Theseventy-eight cards of a standard tarot deck are printed on four sheets oftwenty cards per sheet. This provides room for eighty card-size images per printrun. Most publishers fill the extra spaces by printing two instructional orpromotional cards. Rather than doing that, the Swiss publishers, A. G. Mueller,decided to treat Crowley/Harris aficionados to a little bonus by filling theextra spaces with two earlier versions of the Magus that Harris completed butCrowley rejected. The two extra magi are nothing more esoteric than a thoughtfulbonus from a generous publisher. So please, no more talk of the Three Wise Men!The Magus is not only the title of the Mercurial trump that, in older decks,bears the title Magician or Juggler; it is also a title of the second highestlevel of spiritual illumination a human soul can attain. Toward the end of hislife, Crowley calculated he reached this initiatory degree on his fortiethbirthday, October 12, 1915 E.V. Six years previously, on December 17, 1909, inthe North Mrican Sahara near Biskra, Algeria, he recorded his ceremoniallyinduced vision of the third Enochian Aethyr30 [notes.xhtml#f2t30] that is thesource of much of the imagery found in the Magus card. He describes it asfollows:Mercury is pre-eminently the bearer of the Wand: Energy sent forth. This cardtherefore represents the Wisdom, the Will, the Word, the Logos by whom theworlds were created…. It represents the Will. In brief, he is the Son, themanifestation in act of the idea of the Father. He is the male correlative ofthe High Priestess.31 [notes.xhtml#f2t31]The Magus is also the first of the alchemical trumps, and represents thealchemical element and principal of Mercury. “Mercury,” Crowleys explains,“represents action in all forms and phases. His is the fluidic basis of alltransmission of activity, and, on the dynamic theory of the Universe, he ishimself the substance thereof.”32 [notes.xhtml#f2t32]The figure of the Magus actually forms the alchemical glyph of Mercury. The twosnakes at his head are the horns and the huge stylized wings at his feet makethe arrowhead. He is projected upon the caduceus of Mercury. Behind the leftwing at his feet, barely visible, is a golden sunburst affirming Mercury's roleas herald of the Sun. Behind the right wing is the Cynolcephalus, the Ape ofThoth. This creature, who seems to be groping its way up from the lowerright-hand corner of the card, is the personification of an ironic curse thatafflicts Thoth-Mercury and all who attain the grade of Magus. Because falsehoodand misunderstanding are inherent in all speech and writing, it is the cosmicduty of the Ape of Thoth to constantly mock the work of the Magus and distorthis words. As Crowley points out, “Manifestation implies illusion.”33[notes.xhtml#f2t33]The traditional weapons of the Magus are the wand, cup, sword, and disk. “Withthe Wand,” Crowley observes, “createth He. With the Cup preserveth He. With theDagger destroyth He. With the Coin redeemeth He.”34 [notes.xhtml#f2t34] Theseare the weapons the Magusjoy fully juggles in midair along with four additionalsymbols: the style, papyrus, torch, and winged egg. The wand is the phoenix wandthat symbolizes resurrection through the natural generative process; the cup isof Grecian style with two handles; the sword appears to be a stiletto, theweapon of stealth, deceit, and vengeance; the disk displays the eightfold starof Mercury; the style and papyrus are tools and instruments of the scribe.The winged egg is an especially important factor in the evolving symbolism ofthe Thoth Tarot. In this card, it aptly represents the preexistent zero, which,like the Magus himself, is the source of all positive manifestation, but it willsoon reappear in Atu VI, the Lovers, and other trumps as the symbol known as theOrphic egg. As the trumps develop, this egg will undergo a most wonderfulalchemical adventure, one that is that is told only in the Thoth Tarot.Other elements of the card are at first difficult to see. If we look carefully,we see that the caduceus is much larger than it first appears. Its rod reachesbelow the feet of the Magus to the very bottom of the card, where, by virtue ofits upward thrust, it appears to have stretched and finally penetrated themembrane of space.35 [notes.xhtml#f2t35] The wings of the caduceus span theentire width of the top of the card and reach down behind the neck of the Magus.What appears to be a downward-pointing arrow in the disk of the caduceus isactually the symbol of the descending dove.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------ATU II THE HIGH PRIESTESSThe Priestess of the Silver StarPlanetary Trump of the MoonOriginal Design: A crowned priestess sits before the veil of Isis between thepillars of Seth. She is reading intently in an open book.36 [notes.xhtml#f2t36]Hebrew Letter: Gimel (camel).Tree of Life: Path 13, joining images [images/1.jpg] Kether—Crown to images[images/6_1.jpg] Tiphareth—Beauty.Colors: Blue; Silver; Cold Pale Blue; and Silver, rayed Sky Blue.images [images/102_1.jpg]Purity is to live only to the Highest; and the Highest is All be thou as Artemisto Pan!Read thou in The Book of the Law, and break through the veil of the Virgin!37[notes.xhtml#f2t37]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Moon, partaking as she does of the highest and the lowest and filling allthe space between, is the most universal of the Planets.38 [notes.xhtml#f2t38]It may seem curious that the Priestess represents the Moon, but Atu XVIII, theMoon, represents the zodiac sign of Pisces. We will see what Crowley has to sayabout that when we discuss the Moon. Here, let's be satisfied to know that thePriestess represents the Moon in her higher aspect—the aspect that joins thehuman to the divine. The Moon in Atu XVIII is—well—something else.As the only middle-pillar path that spans the Abyss, the position of the HighPriestess on the Tree of Life is unique. She links the ultimate Father of Ketherto the Son of Tiphareth and, in doing so, joins the supernal triad to the restof the Tree. “In this card,” Crowley points out, “is the one link between thearchetypal and formative worlds.”39 [notes.xhtml#f2t39] The Abyss she traversesis, quite literally, the desert of the soul, and like the desert camel, she isthe only vehicle capable of crossing that terrible wasteland.The principal deities connected with this card are those who, by tradition,represent the lunar goddess, virgin priestess, huntress, and, most importantly,the powers and mysteries of woman as the initiatrix. If you look carefully, youwill see that her bow is actually a three-stringed harp “for she is a huntress,and hunts by enchantment.”40 [notes.xhtml#f2t40]This card is a textbook display of the graphic principles of syntheticprojective geometry.41 [notes.xhtml#f2t41] The arms of the Priestess sweepupward, pulling and distorting the webbed network of space and light, formingthe crescent bowl of a magnificent Moon-colored cup.42 [notes.xhtml#f2t42] Thepillars on either side of her are obscured by the diagonal webbing and somewhatdifficult to see, but it is important to be conscious of their presence whenmeditating on the composition of the card. Harris has brilliantly executedCrowley's description asthe most spiritual form of Isis the Eternal Virgin; the Artemis of the Greeks.She is clothed only in the luminous veil of light. It is important for highinitiation to regard Light not as the perfect manifestation of the EternalSpirit, but rather as the veil which hides that Spirit. It does so all the moreeffectively because of its incomparably dazzling brilliance. Thus she is lightand the body of light. She is the truth behind the Veil of Light. She is thesoul of light.43 [notes.xhtml#f2t43]The High Priestess is the initiatrix. Initiation means “beginning.”The objectsthat appear at the bottom of the card are not lunar symbols per se. The camelis, of course, indicative of the Hebrew letter Gimel (the Hebrew letterattributed to the High Priestess), but the other objects, the crystals andseeds, are suggestive of the hidden and mysterious secrets of the beginning ofife.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------ATU III THE EMPRESSThe Daughter of the Mighty OnesPlanetary Trump of VenusOriginal Design: Crowned with stars, a winged goddess stands upon the moon. Shebears a scepter and a shield, whereon is figured a dove as symbol of the maleand female forces.44 [notes.xhtml#f2t44]Hebrew Letter: Daleth (door).Tree of Life: Path 14, joining images [images/2_1.jpg] Chokmah—Wisdom to images[images/3_1.jpg] Binah—Understanding.images [images/104_1.jpg]Colors: Emerald Green; Sky Blue; Early Spring Green; Bright Rose or cerise,rayed pale green.This is the Harmony of the Universe, that Love unites the Will to create withthe Understanding if that Creation: understand thou thine own Will!Love and let love. Rejoice in every shape if love, and get thy rapture and thynourishment thereof.45 [notes.xhtml#f2t45]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------It is impossible to summarize the meanings of the symbol of the Woman, for thisvery reason, that she continually recurs in infinitely varied form.“Many-throned, many-minded, many-wiled, daughter of Zeus.”46 [notes.xhtml#f2t46]Thank you very much Mr. Crowley!At least we can say this—Daleth means door, and woman is the door of heaven whenwe are conceived, and the door of life and when we are born. The Empress is thetrump of Venus and, in mythology, Venus, or Aphrodite, certainly had (or seemedto cause) her share of trouble. Most of the time, however, she was less theguilefiul instigator of mischie and more the tragic victim of circumstances. Ineither case, almost everybody was in love with her, and she certainly added abit of spice to the Olympian soap opera.Speaking of spice, the Empress is the second of the alchemical trumps andrepresents the element and principal of salt. Like Venus reclining on herlove-couch awaiting the arrival of her next lover, Crowley describes her as “theinactive principle of Nature; Salt is matter which must be energized by Sulfurto maintain the whirling equilibrium of the Universe.”47 [notes.xhtml#f2t47]Sulfur, as we will see in the next trump, is represented by the Emperor—whorepresents the zodiacal sign of Aries—which is ruled by Mars—who was the loverof Venus. (It gets scary when this stuff starts to make sense, doesn't it?)This card is more than just the full-color foldout of the Scarlet O'Hara of thegods, however. The path of Daleth is one of only three paths on the Tree of Lifethat lies entirely above the Abyss. It connects the second sephira, Chokmah (theSupernal Father) to the third sephira, Binah (the Supernal Mother). This is thehallway down which the queen of our Qabalistic fairytale tiptoes to get to thebedroom of the king. This is the path of the exchange of unimaginable love.Harris's Empress is perhaps the most tasteful. and soothing card in the pack.The cool colors immediately lower my blood pressure. At first glance, sheappears to be the goddess of vegetation, which is exactly what she is. Herpresence cuts a doorway through towering plants and grasses. The supports of herthrone are formed from twisted blades of grass, and upon their tops are perchedthe sparrow and dove, birds sacred to Venus. Her green skirt is topped with ablouse of passionate red, ornamented with bees and what appear to be dominossurrounded by spiral rings. Around her waist is the golden belt of the zodiac.Her arms suggest the glyph of salt. She bears the lotus scepter in her lefthand, and her right hand and arm curve delicately as if she were holding aninvisible baby to her breast. This is the magical gesture called MaterTriumphans (Isis suckling the infant Horus). Perhaps this is just a rehearsalfor what is to come. The Empress, if you haven't noticed, is pregnant (her babyfloating blissfuly in a salty sea of amniotic fluid).In keeping with the motherhood theme, we find, at the lower left of the card, awhite pelican feeding its young from the blood of her own breast. On the lowerright is a shield displaying a white double-headed eagle holding the Moon in itsbeaks. This represents the alchemical white tincture whose nature is of the Moonand silver. There is also a red tincture, and we'll discover it in the nexttrump, the Emperor.All of these symbols sit upon a carpet adorned with fleurs-de-lis and tiny fishthat Crowley suggests “seem to be adoring the Secret Rose which is indicated atthe base of the throne.'48 [notes.xhtml#f2t48] The secret rose of the Empress iscertainly worthy of adoration. Her credentials are impeccable: I am Nature and God: I reign, I am, alone.None other may abide apart: they perish,Drawn into me, into my being grown.None other bosom is, to bear, to nourish,To be: the heart of all beneath my zoneOf blue and gold is scarlet-bright to cherishMy own's life being, that is, and is not other;For I am God and Nature and thy Mother.49 [notes.xhtml#f2t49]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------ATU IV THE EMPERORSun of the Morning, chief among the MightyZodiacal Trump of AriesMars Rules—Sol ExaltedOriginal Design: A flame-clad god bearing equivalent symbols.

Sitting in stations & huddling with savage soldiers & children instuffy railway carriages.52 [notes.xhtml#f2t52]—Harris to Crowley, May21,1941.In chapter 13 [chap13.xhtml], I mentioned a paragraph in The Book of Thoth whereCrowley throws us a real curve regarding the whole “Tzaddi is not the Star”matter. It is one of several instances in the book where he seems to contradicthimself on this subject. Before I go on about the Emperor, I Will try toovercome my complete exasperation and calmly address this most frustratingissue. The trouble, it seems, stems from the direction the light comes from inthis card. Let's start by reviewing what Crowley tells us in no uncertain terms(and in multiple places) is the situation: 1. Atu IV is the Emperor. 2. The zodiac sign assigned to the Emperor is Aries. 3. The Hebrew letter for the Emperor is images [images/110.jpg] Tzaddi (and everything images [images/110.jpg] Tzaddi represents). 4. On the Tree of Life, the Emperor is found on path 28, which joins the seventh sephira, Netzach, to the ninth sephira, Yesod.Fine! I'm happy with that. It agrees with Crowley's detailed explanations forthe Tzaddi/Hé switch. It agrees with his charts and diagrams of the Tree ofLife. What it doesn't agree with is the last paragraph of his comments on theEmperor on page 78 [chap11.xhtml#page_78] of The Book of Thoth, where he tellsus:It is finally to be observed that the white light which descends upon himindicates the position of this card in the Tree of Life. His authority isderived from Chokmah, the creative Wisdom, the Word, and is exerted uponTiphareth, the organized man.53 [notes.xhtml#f2t53]The “white light” in the card issues from the upper right corner and shinesdiagonally toward the center of the card. In other words, Crowley is talking asif the Emperor is positioned on the Tree of Life on the path that runs from thesecond sephira, Chokmah, to the sixth sephira, Tiphareth—the path that he tellsus in nearly every other reference should be occupied by the Star. Arghhhh!Personally, I think that, in this case, Harris, was operating from thetraditional understanding of the trumps and their placement on the tree, andCrowley's words carelessly neglected to make that point. Still, I am sure thatstudents of tarot and Crowley will debate this subject forever. As for me, theonly thing I know for sure is that the author of The Book of the Law himselftells us, “All these old letters of my Book are aright but images[images/110.jpg] is not the Star.”54 [notes.xhtml#f2t54] Now, let's moveon—please!Atu IV, the Emperor, represents the sign of Aries, where Mars rules and Sol isexalted. “The sign,” Crowley points out, “is thus a combination of energy in itsmost material form with the idea of authority.”55 [notes.xhtml#f2t55] Referringto this card, Crowley even goes so far as to actually give us a somewhat cynicallesson in civics:He is seated upon the throne whose capitals are the heads of the Himalayan wildram, since Aries means a Ram. At his feet, couchant, is the Lamb and Flag, toconfirm this attribution on the lower plane; for the ram, by nature, is a wildand courageous animal, lonely in lonely places, whereas when tamed and made tolie down in green pastures, nothing is left but the docile, cowardly, gregariousand succulent beast. This is the theory of government.56 [notes.xhtml#f2t56]The Emperor is the third of the alchemical trumps and represents sulfur. Hisarms form the triangle and his legs form the cross of the glyph of sulfur, whichCrowley tells us is “the male fiery energy of the Universe, the Rajas of Hinduphilosophy. This is the swift creative energy, the initiative of all Being.”57[notes.xhtml#f2t57]Upon his shield is the red eagle that identifies him with what the alchemistscall the red tincture. The red tincture is symbolic of the fiery action andnature of the Sun and gold, just as the white eagle on the Empress's shieldidentifies her with the white tincture, symbolic of the action and nature of theMoon and silver. The great alchemical recipe dictates that we must first findthe white tincture, then the red tincture, then unite them to accomplish thegreat work. This, of course, suggests that the Empress and the Emperor enjoy amuch more intimate relationship than what we expect of governmental officials.We will see them get very cozy in Atu XIV, Art.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------ATU V THE HIEROPHANTThe Magus of the EternalZodiacal Trump of TaurusVenus Rules—Luna ExaltedOriginal Design: Between the pillars sits an ancient.

One thing is immediately obvious—this is not yourAeon-of-Osiris Pope. The whole card is presented as the shrine of the Hierophantof the Aeon of Horus, and this guy has some sex appeal.Instead of the pale, humorless features of a delicate prelate officiating atsome demure worship service, we are thrilled by the bold, confident image of aBabylonian priest-king—an initiator in every sense of the word. He's not humblyserved by docile acolytes like the Osirian Hierophant; instead he is activelysupported in his work by his sword-bearing Scarlet Woman, the embodiment ofheavenly Venus who rules Taurus. “Let the woman be girt with a sword before me,”The Book of the Law commands.61 [notes.xhtml#f2t61] “This woman,” Crowleystates, “represents Venus as she now is in this new aeon; no longer the merevehicle of her male counterpart, but armed and militant.”62 [notes.xhtml#f2t62]She carries the Moon, which is exalted in the sign of Taurus. Moreover, we seeevidence of this new initiatory love relationship dramatically highlighted inthe ornate window that illuminates the shrine, which Crowley describes thus:This symbolism is further carried out in the oriel where, behind the phallicheaddress, the rose of five petals is in blossom. The symbolism of the snake anddove refers to this verse of The Book of the Law—chap. I, verse 57; “there arelove and love. There is the dove, and there is the serpent.63[notes.xhtml#f2t63]The window is held in place by nine nails, the number nine being symbolic of theninth sephira, Yesod, the sphere of the Moon. The Hierophant's shrine is guarded(as every good shrine should be) by the four Kerubic beasts. And here I think weshould address what appears at first glance to be a mistake Lady Harris has madeas to the positioning of the four Kerubic beasts.The four Kerubic beasts represent the four fixed signs of the zodiac: Leo (thefixed sign of fire, symbolized by the Lion), Scorpio (the fixed sign of water,symbolized by the eagle), Aquarius (the fixed sign of air, symbolized by a manor angel), and Taurus (the fixed sign of earth, symbolized by the bull). Tarotdecks, reaching back to the earliest packs, have traditionally displayed theKerubic beasts in the corners of various trumps (most often the Wheel of Fortuneand the World). The placement of the four beasts on these old decks is almostuniversally consistent—the lion of Leo is in the lower right corner; the eagleof Scorpio is in the upper right; the man or angel of Aquarius is in the upperleft; and the bull of Taurus is in the lower left. This is the natural order ofthe fixed signs as they appear on the zodiacal belt, and the logical place toput them.In the Thoth Tarot, however, Harris appears to break with this tradition in herplacement of the Kerubic beasts in the Hierophant and the Universe trumps. Thebull and the lion dutifully occupy the traditional corners, but the angel andthe eagle have switched positions. Could it be that she was ignorant of theorder of the signs of the zodiac and that Crowley let her get away with it intwo important cards? Could it be that, in the Aeon of Horus, the signs of thezodiac have been rearranged? The answer to both of these questions is “no.” Inthe New Aeon, it's not the position of the zodiac signs, but the symbols of theKerubs, that have changed.In Crowley's vision of the twenty-third Enochian Æthyr, it is revealed that theemblem for fixed-air Aquarius is now the eagle, and the emblem for fixed-waterScorpio is now the angel:The Beast and the Scarlet Woman are attributed to Leo and Scorpio. They are thetwo-in-one Chief Officers of the Temple of the New/Eon of Heru-Ra-Ha. (Note theEagle Kerub in the 23 Aire is Aquarius. Scorpio is the Woman-Serpent. This isimportant, for the old attribution is of the Eagle to Scorpio64[notes.xhtml#f2t64]The Hierophant's throne is flanked by elephants. He is seated upon the bull ofTaurus itself. He holds in his right hand a wand surmounted by three ringssymbolizing the ascendancy of the Aeon of Horus from the preceding Aeons of Isisand Osiris. His left hand is open in benediction.All this New Aeon imagery is wonderful, but what we should keep foremost in ourminds is the fact that the Hierophant, is the images [images/129.jpg] Vau ofimages [images/129h.jpg] YHVH. He is the six of the divine macrocosmicconsciousness to whom we must “nail” the five of our earthly microcosmicconsciousness. He is the Prince Charming in the cosmic fairytale—our HolyGuardian Angel. The initiatory level characterized by the knowledge andconversation with the H.G.A is illustrated on this card by the union of thepentagram and hexagram. Our microcosmic self is the dancing child in thepentagram upon the Hierophant's macrocosmic breast. The hexagram can be seenenclosing the whole body of the Hierophant.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------ATU VI THE LOVERSThe Children of the VoiceThe Oracle of the Mighty GodsZodiacal Trump of GeminiMercury Rules—Dragon's Head ExaltedOriginal Design: A prophet, young, and in the sign of Osiris Risen.

I haven't decided whether I'll come back & brood on the Foolor stay here.67 [notes.xhtml#f2t67]—Harris to Crowley, date uncertain.Atu VI, the Lovers, is the fourth of the alchemical trumps. A familiaralchemical maxim reads solve et coagula, “solution and coagulation.” The processof solve is represented in tarot by the Lovers; the process of coagula in theArt card. This makes sense astrologically because, in the zodiac, Gemini (theLovers) is opposite Sagittarius (Art). Between these two trumps are other trumpsthat represent developmental phases between solve et coagula.Solve et coagula is a story of a marriage and pregnancy. The main character inthis alchemical love story is not the bride nor the groom, but the child oftheir union. In the Thoth Tarot, the child is symbolized as the Orphic egg that,as Crowley reminds us, “represents the essence of al life that comes under theformula of male and female.”68 [notes.xhtml#f2t68]Like the events surrounding the birth of any child, our alchemical scenariodevelops in stages. Atu VI, the Lovers, is the wedding ceremony; Atu XIV, Art,is the honeymoon; in Atu IX, the Hermit fertilizes the egg; and Atu XIII, Death,keeps it nice and warm in the last stage before hatching.This card is a scene from one of the most famous alchemical texts of all time,The Chymical Marriage if Christian Rosenkreutz, which Crowley describes as “amasterpiece too lengthy and diffuse to quote in this place. But the essence ofthe analysis is the continuous see-saw of contradictory ideas. It is a glyph ofduality.”69 [notes.xhtml#f2t69] Let's look how Lady Harris uses this card to setthe scene for the first phase of this great romance.Starting at the bottom of the card, we find the Orphic egg. It has wings as ifit just few in from the Magus card. In this beginning phase of the operation, itis just the latent seed of life. It sits between a white eagle and a red lionsymbolic of the female and male components of our formula—the white and redtinctures of the Empress and the Emperor. Later, in the Art card, we will seethe advanced stage of the operation—the red lion will turn white and the whiteeagle will turn red.The children attending the bride and groom are none other than Cain and Abel.Their presence, together with Lilith and Eve in the upper corners, springs fromCrowley's vision of the Second Aethyr of The Vision and The Voice. The bride iswhite and wears a silver crown. She holds a golden cup that bears the image ofthe descending dove of the Holy Spirit. Her robe is ornamented with bees likethe ones we saw on the blouse of the Empress and the Emperor. The groom is blackand wears a golden crown. He holds the sacred lance, the complementary weapon tothe bride's cup. His robe is ornamented with snakes like those found on theblouse of the Emperor.The officiating priest is none other than the Hermit of Atu IX. He makes themagical sign of the Enterer by thrusting his hands forward over the couple.Around his arms a scroll of the word (the cosmic marriage certificate) istwisted to form the eternal mobius strip.Above al their heads, the blindfolded figure of Cupid or Eros aims his arrowthreateningly in a direction that appears to threaten no one. This is thedownward arrow70 [notes.xhtml#f2t70] spoken of by the angel of the fifth Aethyrof The Vision and The Voice. The downward arrow is said to be shot by “thetopmost point”71 [notes.xhtml#f2t71] of the Yod of YHVH. As we learned inchapter 9 [chap9.xhtml], the Yod has its topmost point in Kether, but it residesmostly in Chokmah. As we see in the Lovers, Cupid is pointing his arrow directlyfrom Kether to Chokmah.The entire ceremony takes place beneath an arch of steel swords (Zain, theHebrew letter attributed to the Lovers, means “Sword.”). We will see how al thissymbolism reverses and blends when we discuss Atu XIV, Art.

They are much like those foundin traditional versions of this trump. The Chariot is drawn by sphinxesrepresenting the elemental blending of the Kerubic beasts. The starry canopy ofthe chariot represents the night sky. The charioteer is in full armor, much likethe crab of the zodiac sign of Cancer, which this card represents. He bears theHoly Grail, in this case a magnificent carved amethyst (sacred to Jupiter, whichis exalted in Cancer). The whole is a rendering of Crowley's vision of the 12thAethyr in The Vision and The Voice.75 [notes.xhtml#f2t75]What I would like to focus upon is a secret of sexual alchemy that Crowleyseemed anxious to convey in his comments on the Chariot in The Book of Thoth.Let's start by reviewing the above quote from Crowley's “General Characters ofthe Trumps as They Appear in Use”:The Issue of the Vulture, Two-in-One, conveyed; this is the Chariot of Power.TRINC: the last oracle!76 [notes.xhtml#f2t76]This is perhaps the most obscure of all the verses of that work. It talks about“Two-in-One, conveyed”; The Chariot, of course, conveys the charioteer, whoconveys the Holy Grail. Therefore, the Holy Grail must represent (or contain)the Two-in-One. But what is the Holy Grail and what is the Two-in-One?Grail mythology tells us that the Holy Grail is the cup from which Christ drankat the Last Supper, and the same one that Joseph of Aramathea used to catch theblood and water that spilled from the liplike spear wound in the side of thecrucified Christ. Joseph later conveyed the Grail and the spear to a magicallyconstructed castle, where their mysterious powers complicated the lives of manygenerations of noble knights. In one very real way, the Chariot is the Chapel ofthe Holy Grail on wheels.Am I trying to tell you that the precious bodily fluids of Christ are reallyingredients of the Two-in-One cocktail of the Holy Grail? In a way, yes. Butlet's look at it another way—let's look at it as “The Issue of the Vulture.”In Egyptian mythology, the vulture was sacred to Maat, the goddess of justiceand supreme balance. The vulture was said to conceive without mating. Its childimmaculately conceived in a mysterious internal process that, for othercreatures, requires contributions of from both male and female. The Issue of theVulture is therefore the product (or child) of an internal marriage of twoperfectly balanced things, or Two-in-One.That's all fine and good, but in real life, vultures mate like every other bird,and even if they didn't, how would we humans go about emulating that magicalprocess. For us, neither the male nor the female is a complete human unitcapable of reproduction. What is absent in the male is present in the female,and vice versa. Our creation of the Two-in-One that results in the issue of ahuman baby is the most natural and (and usually the most pleasant) of allcooperative endeavors. How are the principles that effect the very human sexualact reflected on a cosmic scale, however? What would we do with the realTwo-in-One even if we knew how to create it?The answer is “TRINC,” an oracular word that comes from the story of Gargantuaand Pantagruel, a mystical satire by François Rabelais (1494-1553). In thestory, one of the main characters, Panurge, seeks the answer to the question,“Should I marry?” He and his companions eventually decide to seek the Oracle ofthe Bottle for the answer. Mter many adventures, they finally reach the Templeof the Bottle.” They pass through the door upon which is written En OinoAletheia (In wine lies truth), where Bacbuc, the Priestess of the temple, takesthem into the presence of the Holy Bottle. Panurge poses his question, and theHoly Bottle answers by making a sharp sound like that of cracking glass:“Trine!” (Drink!). Panurge interprets this as an affirmative answer and anadmonition to drink deep from the well spring of life and knowledge.As you have probably guessed, Panurge's question “Should I marry?” has deepermagical implications than simply questioning the wisdom or folly of matrimony.It should be of particular interest to us because we see so much “marrying”going on in the trumps of the Thoth Tarot. Recall that our Qabalistic fairytalein chapter 10 [chap10.xhtml] is all about marriage; the marriage of the Princeand Princess (the Holy Guardian Angel and his client), and the marriage of thesupernal King and Queen. Two things becoming one seems to be a formula ofsupreme spiritual importance in the tarot. But Trine (drink) is a curious answerto the question, “Should I marry?” Drink what?The Hebrew letter associated with the Chariot is Cheth, which, when spelled infull, enumerates to 418, the same number as ABRAHADABRA, the magical word thatexpresses the formula of the marriage of the microcosm with the macrocosm (orthe aspirant to his or her Holy Guardian Angel). This word (with a slight LadyHarris typo) can be seen embroidered in the canopy of the Chariot. ABRAHADABRAis also indicative of the uniting of male and female that we see expressed inother trumps as alchemical images such as the red/white lion and white/redeagle.The Chariot represents the zodiac sign of Cancer, whose symbol is anot-too-subtle glyph for a particular technique of tantric yoga in which maleand female energies and essences are perfectly prepared, balanced, and exchangedto create the Two-in-One elixir of Life. The elixir is then conveyed in aparticular manner to serve as a eucharistic talisman of unlimited creativepotential.In the language of Thelemic imagery, the elixir is brewed in the Holy Grail byBabalon/Nuit in Binah (the Queen of our Qabalistic fairytale), who then offersit to the Beast/Hadit in Chokmah (the King of our Qabalistic fairytale) and theyboth drink (TRINC) and become ecstatically drunken. In doing so, they annihilateall sense of separateness, and so on. (See chapter 10 [chap10.xhtml] if you needto review the whole story.)The path of the Chariot crosses the Abyss and joins the fifth sephira, Geburah,to the third sephira, Binah. Being so high on the Tree of Life, its mysteriesdeal with the most sublime and profound aspects of nature and consciousness.Please keep this in mind when you are tempted to view this card (and mycomments) as simply an expression of sexual alchemy. As effective as thisoperation can be, it is only a refection of the magick of the gods, a faint echoof the titanic forces, energy, and love that creates, sustains, and destroys theuniverse.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------ATU VIII ADJUSTMENTThe Daughter of the Lords of TruthThe Ruler of the BalanceZodiacal Trump of LibraVenus Rules—Saturn ExaltedOriginal Design: A conventional figure of Justice with scales and balances.77[notes.xhtml#f2t77]Hebrew Letter: Lamed (ox goad).Tree of Life: Path 22, joining images [images/5_1.jpg] Geburah—Severity toimages [images/6_1.jpg] Tiphareth—Beauty.Colors: Emerald Green; Blue; Deep Blue-Green; Pale Green.images [images/117h.jpg]Balance against each thought its exact Opposite!

From the cloak of the vivid wantonness of her dancing wingsissue her hands; they hold the hilt of the Phallic sword of the magician.

Do you think there was ever “a womansatisfied”? With what a smirk she would greet the dawn.80 [notes.xhtml#f2t80]—Harris to Crowley, December 19, 1939.My experience of satisfied women is that they do greet the dawn with a smirk; ifnot the dawn, any time up to five o'clock in the afternoon, and only when itwears off does one have to start all over again….These notes on Justice, or as we have preferred to call her “Adjustment.”…Isuppose I was in a very bad temper when I made my criticism, but I do feelstrongly that the plumes of Maat are too insignificant, and the Dove and Ravenlook simply stuck on; nor do I think that the tessellated pavement is quiteright. The general criticism is that the card is a little too cold; Libra is thesign of autumn, season of mists and mellow fruit fulness, close-bosomed friendof the maturing sun. In your card you have got the idea of balance static,whereas it ought to be dynamic. Nature is not the grocer weighing out a pound ofsugar; it is the compensation of complicated rhythms. I should like you to feelthat every adjustment was a grande passion; compensation should be a festival,not a clerk smugly pleased that his accounts are correct. It seems to me thatthis doctrine is very important as a commentary on the text “Existence is purejoy”, and I feel sure that the connection of Venus and Saturn with the sign issignificant in this respect. The compensation is surely the awakening of the Eldof the Al-Father, the constant reproduction of the original purity from the laststage of illusion. (Compare what I said above about the number Ten)…To return to “Adjustment”; those birds bother me very much. I don't think theybelong. I think they come from Noah's Ark. It would be better to simplify thiscard by leaving them out altogether. I feel sure that when you get the Venus andSaturn dancing motive firmly in your mind, you will produce a lady whom you willlike better.81 [notes.xhtml#f2t81]—Crowley to Harris, December 19,1939The Adjustment is being queer with me. She has, after al, insisted on beingBeardsley!82 [notes.xhtml#f2t82] Also Harlequin comes in & out of it so I musthave to submit. But why Harlequin? Is there any connection? Also she won't sitdown but stands on her toes just balanced. The design-result is good. That blueis cobalt I take it. The instruction says Blue-Blue Green. Pale green Emerald.That Emerald is a vile pigment in poster paints.83 [notes.xhtml#f2t83]—Harris to Crowley, July 12, 1940.Judging from what is written in the above excerpts from the Crowley-Harriscorrespondence, it is clear that the early drafts of Adjustment bore littleresemblance to the finished product. Crowley obviously had a clear idea what wasneeded, and the fact that he wrote so passionately on the matter underscores theimportance he ascribed to this trump. His words are aimed, however, not only atFrieda Harris, the artist, but at Soror Tzaba, the magical student. He not onlywanted the Adjustment card to turn out the way he wanted, he wanted Harris toappreciate its spiritual importance and achieve an epiphany of understanding. Itappears to me that they both were successful.The goddess of Adjustment is in perfect balance, left to right and top tobottom. Amid spheres of light and darkness, she stands on tiptoe at the verypoint of her sword. An enormous set of balances suspends from the perfect pointof her crown (the ostrich plumes of Maat, the Egyptian goddess of justice). Theleft scale pan holds the alpha, and the right the omega. The lines from her toesto the scale pans to the tip of her crown create a lozenge, a type of vesica84[notes.xhtml#f2t84] (by which students of mystic geometry measure theimmeasurable), which stretches the fabric of space to reveal the goddess.Crowley calls Adjustment “the feminine complement of the Fool.”85[notes.xhtml#f2t85]The combined Hebrew letters these cards represent, Aleph and Lamed, spell AL andenumerate to 31. AL is the root of the Hebrew word for “God”; LA is the Hebrewword for “not.” In the Western Zen of Thelema, “God-Not-God” is a very importantconcept.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------ATU IX THE HERMITThe Prophet of the EternalThe Magus of the Voice of PowerZodiacal Trump of VirgoMercury Rules—Mercury ExaltedOriginal Design: Wrapped in a cloak and cowl, an ancient walketh, bearing a lampand staff.

Is it because you don't know the answer?88[notes.xhtml#f2t88]—Harris to Crowley, November 30, 1939.By now, you are probably tired of hearing me talk about the special virtuesinherent in the element earth. You probably think you've heard enough about howhumble earth is uniquely connected to spirit, and how it helps regenerate thehighest high because of the simple fact that it is the lowest low (see chapter11 [chap11.xhtml]).Well, get ready to hear some more, because we are not through yet. As a matterof fact, in the pages that follow, you are going to get some pretty big doses ofthis doctrinal medicine that Crowley calls the “climax of the Descent intoMatter.”89 [notes.xhtml#f2t89] Why is it so important for you to keep takingthis medicine? First of all, because it will help you understand the livingnature of tarot. More important, however, because you are the grand climax ofthe descent into matter.I have tried to organize the material of this book so that by the time you readabout the last card of the tarot, the Ten of Disks, you will be armed withenough occult knowledge to comprehend the great magick that takes place there.It is a process that Crowley calls, “the mode of fulfillment of the GreatWork.”90 [notes.xhtml#f2t90]I'm sure you wouldn't do this, but if you were to turn to the back of the bookand read what I have written about the Ten of Disks, you would learn (albeitprematurely) that the three key cosmic players that are responsible for creatingthat “mode of fulfillment of the Great Work” are Earth, Mercury, and the Sun.That shouldn't surprise you really. After all, Earth is that speciallowest-of-the-low element you're getting so tired of hearing about; tarot is theprovince of Thoth/Mercury; and the Sun is the secret seed of universal life thatwe knew was going be so important since we first saw it radiating from in frontof the Fool's groin. Earth, Mercury, and the Sun have their first importantstrategy meeting in Atu IX, the Hermit.Just look at how Earth, Mercury, and the Sun come together in the Hermit. Herepresents the zodiac sign of Virgo. Virgo is the mutable sign of Earth. Virgois ruled by Mercury, and Mercury is exalted in Virgo. The Hermit carries thelamp of the Sun, with which he gives his light to the world. It's a simple asthat.We've met the Hermit once before as the hooded figure that officiates at theroyal wedding in Atu VI, the Lovers, and, while he is sexually ambivalent, he isindeed a “he” and an important expression of male creative energy. The Hebrewletter sacred to Virgo and the Hermit is images [images/121.jpg] Yod, the tenthletter, and the first and supreme letter in images [images/121h.jpg] YHVH. In avery real way, the tiny fame of Yod is the fundamental Hebrew letter. All theother letters are created from this basic form. As the hidden seed of the Hebrewalphabet, Yod also symbolizes the mystery of sperm, the hidden seed, and acentral secret of fertilization. (See how the Hermit stares at the Orphic egg?If I were that egg, I'd be nervous!) Crowley writes, “In this Trump is shewn theentire mystery of Life in its most secret workings.”91 [notes.xhtml#f2t91]While, in my opinion, this remains true, we have to remember that Crowley diedbefore the discovery of DNA, and so his understanding of biology was naturallyincomplete and based upon obsolete doctrines and theories. There is, however, anabundance of images in this card to handily accommodate more recent scientificdiscoveries, and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to tell us this card isloaded. Let's see how Harris graphically handles all of this.First of all, the figure of the Hermit himself is one big stylized Yod. Hesports the ibis head of Thoth/Mercury. The only other visible part is his hand.(Yod in Hebrew) He stands in the fertile field of wheat. The heavy-headed shaftssuggestive of sperm. He carries the lamp of the Sun. He is dogged by Cerberus,the three-headed guardian of the gates of the underworld, whom Hermes/Mercurytamed with honey cakes during his mission to rescue Persephone from Hades.Perhaps the most intriguing image on the card is what appears to be a wrigglingsperm cell in the lower left corner. Actually, it is the Homunculus image, firstdrawn in 1694 by Nicholas Hartsoecker, a noted advocate of the long-discreditedtheory of reproduction called the principal of spermist preformation.92[notes.xhtml#f2t92] If you look closely at the head of the Homunculus, you willsee a large-headed baby curled in the fetal position. While this concept isbased upon biologically inaccurate science, it expresses the more universal andmagically correct doctrine of correspondence: As above, so below.You may find it rewarding to study the Hermit trump in conjunction with Atu XV,the Devil.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------ATU X FORTUNEThe Lord of the Forces of LifePlanetary Trump of JupiterOriginal Design: A wheel of six shafts, whereon revolve the Triad of Hermanubis,Sphinx, and Typhon (images [images/123.jpg] alchemical mercury, sulfur, andsalt, or the three gunas sattva, rajas, and tamas).93 [notes.xhtml#f2t93]Hebrew Letter: Kaph (palm of hand).Tree of Life: Path 21, joining images [images/4_1.jpg] Chesed—Mercy to images[images/7.jpg] Netzach—Victory.Colors: Violet; Blue; Rich Purple; Bright Blue, rayed yellow.images [images/123h.jpg]Follow thy Fortune, careless where it lead thee!

Your books are wonderfi.il but you must not expect the reading ormoney making world to buy them as they don't want to think.95[notes.xhtml#f2t95]—Harris to Crowley, May 10,1939.For centuries, the Wheel of Fortune has been interpreted as the card of goodluck. That is only partially true. It is also the card of bad luck; and the cardof luck getting better; and the card of luck getting worse. Whatever kind ofluck we are talking about, one thing's a sure bet. It's going to change. “Thiscard,” Crowley insists, “thus represents the Universe in its aspect as acontinual change of state.”96 [notes.xhtml#f2t96]Change is stability, and with stability comes order, and the god that bringsorder to so-called creation is the Demiurge,97 [notes.xhtml#f2t97] the highestgod below the Abyss—the “creator” god who thinks it is the supreme deity,because it is unaware of the circumstances of its own creation. Allow me to putthis concept in terms of Roman mythology.Saturn and his wife, Cybele, were Titans, aspects of the old chaotic forces thatpreceeded the so-called “ordered universe.” Saturn was warned in prophesy thatone of his own offspring would one day dethrone him, so each time Cybele gavebirth, Saturn swallowed the child. As long as he kept doing this, the universeremained in pure potentiality, and “creation” (as we know it) was put on hold.Cybele eventually got tired of all this baby eating and, when she gave birth toher sixth child, Jupiter, she tricked Saturn by giving him a stone to swallow.She then secretly removed the child from Saturn's presence and brought him toEarth to be raised. Saturn eventually got indigestion and threw up the rock andthe five other divine children. As prophesied, Jupiter dethroned Saturn,organized his brothers and sisters, brought order to the cosmos, and, from ourmortal point of view, created the universe.Why am I telling you this story here? Because, in Qabalistic terms, when Cybeleremoved baby Jupiter from Saturn's presence, she disturbed the status quo ofprecreation chaos and, in doing so, created the three landmark environments ofthe Tree of Life: the supernal triad (the pre-creational state), the Abyss (thatseparates the supernal triad from creation), and the seven sephiroth below theAbyss.Above the Abyss, all opposites are reconciled. There is no concept of change orluck or anything else we can comprehend. It is only below the Abyss that thelumbering apparatus of forces and principals that appear to drive the universeis set in motion. The fundamental flywheel that keeps this great machinechurning out everything we interpret as existence is a very efficient littleperpetual-motion device located in the highest sephira below the Abyss,Chesed—the sphere of Jupiter, where the three gunas revolve. The blueprint forthis three-stroke engine is Atu X, Fortune.If you look very carefully at Lady Harris's interpretation, you will see a largetriangle, its apex pointing upward, just behind the wheel. The base of thetriangle is somewhat obscured by several of the ten plumes of energy that sprayfrom the ends of each spoke of the wheel like the fiery sparks that propel afireworks pinwheel. The hub of the wheel is positioned within the triangle. Thistwo-part symbol is called Centrum In Centri Trigono98 [notes.xhtml#f2t98] and isthe symbolic key to the secret of Jupiter. It is also the key to transcendingthe secret of Jupiter.Every year, various O.T.O. bodies throughout the world present publicperformances of Crowley's seven planetary rituals, The Rites of Eleusis. If youever get a chance to attend these lively audience-participation plays, Istrongly urge that you do so. At the beginning of the Rite of Jupiter, the stageis set to represent Atu X, Fortune. Dominating the scene is a large wheel. Atthe hub of the wheel sits Centrum In Centri Trigono. Three actors portrayingHermanubis, Typhon, and the Sphinx are positioned upon the rim of the wheel.They spend the better half of Act I bickering with each other while they circlethe rim of the wheel in a fruitless attempt to reach the motionless center.Although Hermanubis, Typhon, and the Sphinx are not openly identified as thealchemical elements (mercury, salt, and sulfur), or as the tarot trumps (theMagus, the Empress, and the Emperor), or as the gunas (sattvas, tamas, andrajas), that is exactly what they are, and they are locked in a perpetual gameof one-ups-manshipC.I.C.T. addresses Typhon as “Feeling,” Hermanubus as “Thought,” and the Sphinxas “Ecstasy.” In a moment of fatherly magnanimity, he shares with them theZen-like secret of jupiter:Feeling, and thought, and ecstasyAre but the cerements of Me.Thrown of flike planets from the SunYe are but satellites of the One.But should your revolution stopYe would inevitably dropHeadlong within the central Soul,And all the parts become the Whole.Sloth and activity and peace,When will ye learn that ye must cease?”99 [notes.xhtml#f2t99]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------ATU XI LUSTThe Daughter of the Flaming Sword Zodiacal Trump of Leo Sol Rules—Uranus ExaltedOriginal Design: A smiling woman holds the open jaws of a fierce and powerfullion.100 [notes.xhtml#f2t100]Hebrew Letter: Teth (serpent).Tree of Life: Path 19, joining images [images/4_1.jpg] Chesed—Mercy to images[images/5_1.jpg] Geburah—Severity.Colors: Yellow (greenish); Deep Purple; Grey; Reddish Amber.Mitigate Energy with Love; but let Love devour all things.Worship the name——————images [images/126.jpg]foursquare, mystic, wonderful, and the name of His House 418.”101[notes.xhtml#f2t101](Crowley note): This Name to be communicated to those worthy of that Initiation.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well you must understand the feeling of it. Now how do you feel if you see nicechocolates & there, you get them & how good they taste. That is a picture of howyou feel about those chocolates.102 [notes.xhtml#f2t102]—Harris to Crowley, March 25, 1942.That is how at an exhibition of her paintings Lady Harris explained the Lustcard to an inquisitive child. The principal deities connected with this card arethose who, by tradition, are associated with the power of the female to arouse,harness, and direct the animal nature: Demeter and Astarte borne by lions; Venusrepressing the Volcanic fire; Babylon the Great and the Beast of the Book of theRevelation.Lust is perhaps the most beautiful and provocative of the entire deck and one ofthe trumps that exemplifies Crowley's visionary and initiatory experienceschronicled in The Vision and The Voice, particularly his vision of the 12thAethyr.While very tame by modern standards, the naked image of the Babylon/103[notes.xhtml#f2t103] the Scarlet Woman, elevating the Holy Grail and straddlinga fantastic and terrible seven-headed104 [notes.xhtml#f2t104] Beast is still toodaring for many twenty-first-century sensitivities. In state and federal prisonsthroughout the United States, the Thoth Tarot (because of the Lust card) isconsidered pornographic contraband and its possession by inmates is forbidden.Even seasoned taroists who should know better, point to the Lust card as anotherexample of Crowley polluting the tarot with his dirty mind.Nothing could be further from the truth. The imagery is illustrative of the mostsublime and universal spiritual arcanum—that of the ecstatic dissolution of allwe are (referred to in Thelemic texts as the “blood of the Saints”) into theuniversal self of godhead (symbolized as a great “whore” and the Holy Grail sheembodies). This is not—I repeat—this is not a statement concerning morality orimmorality! It is perhaps the most perfect example of Crowley's use of an oldAeon “blaspheme” to illustrate a more accurate view of new Aeon spiritualperception.For two thousand years, the symbol of the virgin has been the symbol of the purevessel and the supreme female spiritual ideal in Western civilization. It's awonderful symbol, as far as it goes, that deals with the great mystery of thedescent of divine spirit into matter. The mystery of Babylon concerns anentirely different concept—that of the reabsorption of all evolving life andconsciousness into Binah, the great supernal female. In this mystery, the symbolof the whore (who is indiscriminately receptive to all) becomes the supreme andholy image. Listen to how Crowley's angel of the 12th Aethyr describes her:This is the Mystery of Babylon, the Mother of abominations, and this is themystery of her adulteries, for she hath yielded up herself to everything thatliveth, and hath become a partaker in its mystery. And because she hath madeherself the servant of each, therefore she is become the mistress of all.105[notes.xhtml#f2t105]The supreme spiritual message of this card may be summed up something like this:Eventually each of us will come to a level of consciousness so profoundly highthat the only level higher is the universal consciousness of deity itself. Ourdissolution into the infinite is the ultimate sacrifice, the ultimate marriage.Deity lusts for that moment when all her children will return to her. Someday,each one of us will also lust for that moment.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------ATU XII THE HANGED MANThe Spirit of the Mighty WatersElemental Trump of WaterOriginal Design: The figure of a hanged or crucified man.

Goodnight.108 [notes.xhtml#f2t108]—Harris to Crowley, Fall, 1939.I have long foreseen the ‘'Alice in Wonderland” conclusion of our labours, butthat if you remember was the signal for the awakening to the beauty of life.109[notes.xhtml#f2t109]—Crowley to Harris, December 19,1939.To paraphrase what I said concerning the Hierophant, Atu XII is not your Aeon ofOsiris Hanged Man. Neither is it the Hanged Man of the Aeon of Isis. Crowleymakes a tremendous attempt to explain why this is so in The Book of Thoth.Please don't misunderstand me. I mean no disrespect when I use the words“attempt to explain,” and I am certainly not suggesting that I could explainthese things any better. It is just very clear to me that, before Crowley satdown to write his commentary on this card, he must have swallowed a handful ofl-think-I-will-try-to-explain-the-innermost-secret-of-life-and-all-the-mysteries-of-HighMagick-and-the-Universe-in-general pills.He gives it a pretty good try. He even offers us several very revealingparagraphs concerning the most profound secrets of sexual alchemy and magickthat, for those who are interested in those subjects, will certainly be worthfarther study and meditation (see chapter 11 [chap11.xhtml]). Perhaps the reasonhe apparently goes so far afield in his comments is that he believed that theHanged Man, as historically and traditionally understood, is now obsolete in aNew Aeon tarot deck. In fact, he tells us to regard it as an evil legacy fromthe old Aeon and goes on to compare it rather unflatteringly with the appendixin the human body:This card is beautiful in a strange, immemorial, moribund manner. It is the cardof the Dying God; its importance in the present pack is merely that of theCenotaph.”110 [notes.xhtml#f2t110]A cenotaph is a tomb or a monument erected to honor a person whose actual bodyis buried somewhere else. Be that as it may, he goes on to give us a very goodAeon-of-Horus interpretation of the Hanged Man, the highlights of which (eventhough I don't have any ITIWTTETISOLAATMOHMATUIG pills) I will try to summarize.First, observe that the arms and legs of our crucified hero make the figure of across surmounting a triangle. Crowley tells us that this symbolizes “the descentof the light into the darkness in order to redeem it.”111 [notes.xhtml#f2t111]It is nothing less than the cosmic sacrifice that creates, sustains, anddestroys the universe. Our perception of how we are part of this grand sacrificehas evolved over the aeons. The sacrifice meant one thing to our ancestors inthe Aeon of Isis, another thing in the Aeon of Osiris, and now, as we shall see,means something altogether different in the present Aeon of Horus. (If, for somereason, you have not read chapter 6 [chap6.xhtml], I suggest that you do sobefore reading on.)Crowley identifies the Aeon of Isis with the element water. This was an age whenit was universally perceived that human life came from woman alone. Thesacrifice was made by the woman on the altar of her own body, and the Hanged Manwas the unborn baby who floated upside down in the water of the womb just priorto birth.The Aeon of Osiris is identified with the element air, which is sympathetic toboth water and fire. Therefore, in the Aeon of Osiris, the sacrifice was one ofcompromise. This was the age of the dying god, when a guy just couldn't be areal savior unless he first came out of the water (baptized, etc.) and thencompromised his own body by allowing him self to be tortured, murdered, thenhung or nailed to a tree to redeem the lives of his people. A couple of thousandyears ago, this selfless gesture was a big step forward in spiritual politeness.As a matter of fact, for the Aeon of Osiris, it became the supreme formula ofadeptship expressed by I N R I / I A 0 (see chapter 8 [chap8.xhtml]).The Aeon of Horus is identified with the element fire (represented by the Hebrewmother letter images [images/130.jpg] Shin and the Aeon trump). In the Aeon ofHorus, the water of the Hanged Man and the fire of the Aeon don't get along atall. In this Aeon, Crowley warns, “The whole idea of sacrifice is amisconception of nature…”112 [notes.xhtml#f2t112] The gesture of sacrificialsuicide is not only obsolete, it is downright counterproductive:But now, under a Fiery lord of the Aeon, the watery element, so far as water isbelow the Abyss, is definitely hostile, unless the opposition is the rightopposition implied in marriage.”113 [notes.xhtml#f2t113]The marriage he is talking about is the “annihilation of the self in theBeloved.”114 [notes.xhtml#f2t114] This is symbolized in the card by the ankh(the union of the Rose and Cross, of male and female.) It is the devotionalecstasy that dissolves al sense of separateness that I wrote about in chapter 11[chap11.xhtml]. This “marriage,” as mystics and saints of every age and culturehave tried to tell us, is the supreme sacrifice.The Hanged Man of the Thoth Tarot still symbolizes the descent of the light intothe darkness in order to redeem it, but the word “redeem” no longer implies anexisting debt that needs to be paid. Instead, redemption in the Aeon of Horus isthe noble duty of the enlightened to bring enlightenment to the unenlightened.Please note how Lady Harris ingeniously uses projective geometry to link thiscard with other water-related cards. Try placing the Hanged Man top-to-top withthe High Priestess and the Queen of Cups. Other items of interest include herstylized Enochian tablets in the background, and her use of the color green toinject a Venusian influence.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------ATU XIII DEATHThe Child of the Great TransformersThe Lord of the Gate of DeathZodiacal Trump of ScorpioMars Rules—Pluto ExaltedOriginal Design: A skeleton with a scythe mowing men.

TheHebrew letter assigned to Death is Nun, which means “fish.” The fish is one ofthe most revered symbols of tenacious life and resurrection in the traditions ofWestern civilization. Dead fish decay quickly and smell terrible (in Denmark andeverywhere else!), but the secret of life is in that stinky stuff.It is very difficult to discuss the Death card without also discussing the nexttrump, Art. From an alchemical point of view, Death really should come after Artfor the not-so-simple reason that Art foreshadows the final stage of the greatwork. Death is the final stage itself Even though it is not pictured in theDeath card, our snake-wrapped Orphic egg—the latent seed of life that we firstsaw in the Magus card, whose elements were married in the Lovers, and which thenwas fertilized by the Hermit—is now entering the last stage of developmentbefore hatching into new life.In a way, the Art card actually incorporates the Death card in its imagery. Ifyou turn forward a few pages and look at the illustration of the Art card, youwill see an androgyne figure pouring fire and water upon the heads of a lion andan eagle and then into a great cauldron. If you look closely at the cauldron,you wil^^ see the image of a raven perched upon a human skull. Lady Harris mayas well have painted a sign on the cauldron that reads, “This is cauldron is theDeath card.”The emblem of the raven and skull is called the caput mortuum, and indicates thealchemical process that takes place inside the cauldron. That process isputrefaction, and putrefaction is what the Death card is all about:In alchemy, this card explains the idea of putrefaction, the technical namegiven by its adepts to the series of chemical changes which develops the finalform of life from the original latent seed in the Orphic egg.118[notes.xhtml#f2t118]Things may be rotten in Denmark, but in the alchemy of tarot, the stink ofputrefaction is the sweet smell of impending success. It is a threefold processthat gently warms the Orphic egg during its last most sensitive phase beforebirth. If we were to look into the cauldron, we would see that process bubblingaway as a scorpion, a serpent, and an eagle, the three images and aspects ofScorpio.The scorpion is found in the lower right corner of the Death card, andsymbolizes, according to Crowley, the lowest aspect of Scorpio.The lowest is symbolized by the Scorpion, which was supposed by early observersof Nature to commit suicide when finding itself ringed with fire, or otherwisein a desperate situation. This represents putrefaction in its lowest form. Thestrain of environment has become intolerable, and the attacked element willinglysubjects itself to change.”119 [notes.xhtml#f2t119]The middle aspect of Scorpio, Crowley explains, is represented as a serpent,which can be seen in the lower left corner:The serpent is sacred, Lord of Life and Death, and its method of progressionsuggests the rhythmical undulation of those twin phases of life which we callrespectively life and death120 [notes.xhtml#f2t120]The third symbol of Scorpio is the eagle that we see in the upper left corner ofthe card. The eagle, as described by Crowley, is a real gas!The highest aspect of the card is the Eagle, which represents exaltation abovesolid matter. It was understood by the early chemists that, in certainexperiments, the purest (i.e., most tenuous) elements present were given off asgas or vapour. 121 [notes.xhtml#f2t121]If all three of these aspects of putrefaction are in turn allowed to unfoldperfectly, they generate the gentle heat necessary to incubate the Orphic egg inits final stage of development.The Death card of the Thoth Tarot is the antithesis of those found intraditional packs. This is no stiff grim reaper standing on the Earth,indiscriminately mowing down people, young and old, humble and highborn. ThisDeath is vivacious and flexible. He wears the crown of Osiris and dances madlyon the bottom of the sea. Instead of mowing down the living, he uses his scytheto stir up bubbles of new lives from the out of the seemingly dead and decayingsediment. “So also,” Crowley observes, “the formula of continued life is death,or putrefaction.”122 [notes.xhtml#f2t122] Death is, thus, in truth, “theoriginal secret male creative God.”123 [notes.xhtml#f2t123]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------ATU XIV ARTThe Daughter of the Reconcilers, the Bringer forth of LifeZodiacal Trump of SagittariusJupiter Rules—Dragon's Tale ExaltedOriginal Design: The figure of Diana huntress.

We see echoes of this original theme in the two bows nearthe top of the card and the tiny upward-pointing arrow rising in the rainbowfumes of the cauldron. The celebrated Diana of Ephesis is portrayed in statuaryas having many breasts. The deeply plunging neckline on the dress of the Artcard's main figure reveals three columns of neatly stacked breasts reminiscentof the famous Ephesian statue of Diana.With these exceptions, the Sagittarian imagery is almost completely smothered inalchemical symbolism. After all, as Crowley points out, “This card representsthe Consummation of the Royal Marriage which took place in Atu VI”127[notes.xhtml#f2t127] and Art is the “coagula” to the Lovers “solve” Also, inthis card, the white tincture of the Empress is united with the red tincture ofthe Emperor.We've already learned, in chapter 8 [chap8.xhtml], that the Magus, the Empress,and the Emperor represent the alchemical elements of mercury, salt, and sulfur.We also learned that these three principals, when combined and perfectlybalanced, create the universal solvent, vitriol. What we haven't as yet learnedis what to do with our vitriol. Just what are we supposed to dissolve with it? Iguess the simplest answer would be to say that vitriol dissolves old life inorder to create new life. Let's look at the Art card and see where that new lifeis going to come from.First of all, notice that the figures in the forefront of the card arepositioned before a huge golden egg. This is, of course, the Orphic egg, andeverything we see happening in front of the egg is actually the secret work thatis being done inside. Shimmering around the egg, as if to advertise the radiantlife within, is a golden aura displaying in beautiful penmanship the alchemicalmotto: VISITA INTERIORA TERRAE RECTIFICANDO IMENIES OCCULTUMLAPIDEM-“Visit theinterior parts of the earth: by rectification thou shalt find the hidden stone.”Cooking up the potion that is making that visit possible is a strange andwonderful being whom we first met as two characters, the bride and groom, in AtuVI, the Lovers. The black King and white 2.1teen have now merged and become asingle character with two heads. The white bride now has black hair and wearsthe golden crown; the black groom now has golden hair and wears the silvercrown. Her/his arms are exposed to reveal that the body is also countercharged.His/her dress is decorated with both bees and serpents, and she/he stands behinda cauldron into which he/she pours water from a silver chalice from his/her lefthand, and fire from her/his right hand. Flanking the cauldron (as they flankedthe Orphic egg in the Lovers) stand the lion and the eagle. They have also madea dramatic change. The lion has turned white and the eagle is now red, havingtransmuted to their opposite characteristic by the dual baptism of fire andwater (the union of the white and red tinctures).At the very bottom of the card, the fire and the water exist together inharmony. Crowley writes,But this is only crude symbol of the spiritual idea, which is the satisfactionof the desire of the incomplete element of one kind to satisfy its formula byassimilation of its equal and opposite.128 [notes.xhtml#f2t128]I understand that, for many readers of this book, these forays into the strangeand abstruse world of alchemy may seem like unwelcome detours from the subjectof tarot. They are, however, Crowley's forays, and they are an important aspectof the Thoth Tarot that set it apart from the more traditional decks. Thealchemical aspects of the Thoth Tarot are implicit in the fundamental structureof the tarot itself Indeed, until I became familiar with the alchemicalprocesses Crowley introduces in The Book of Thoth, I really had no idea why theoriginal title of the Temperance/Art card was “The Daughter of the Reconcilers,the Bringer forth of Life.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------ATU XV THE DEVILThe Lord of the Gates of MatterThe Child of the Forces of TimeZodiacal Trump of CapricornSaturn Rules—Mars ExaltedOriginal Design: The figure of Pan or Priapus.

It is a false name invented by the Black Brothers toimply a Unity in their ignorant muddle of dispersions. A devil who had unitywould be a god.131 [notes.xhtml#f2t131]The Devil may not exist, but there is most definitely a Devil card in the tarot,and, in my opinion, he is the most universally misunderstood character in theentire deck. (But then, you probably guessed I would say that.)This is the trump of Capricorn, the sign of the goat. Indeed, for the purpose offortune telling, the Devil has truly been the scapegoat for all the perceivedevils that could befall us, and the sinful temptations that are constantlyluring us toward self-destruction. How convenient!But if the Devil is supposed to be the card that represents evil, which cardshould we pick to represent good? Al the other trumps have the potential ofrepresenting the qualities of both good and evil. Why do we need one card justfor evil?Can't the Fool be thoughtless enough; the Magus larcenous enough, the HighPriestess seductive enough, the Empress wicked enough, the Emperor tyrannicalenough, the Hierophant bigoted enough, the Lovers unfaithful enough, the Chariotpretentious enough, Lust lascivious enough, the Hermit self-abusive enough,Fortune ill-fated enough, Adjustment unfair enough, the Hanged Man tormentedenough, Death murderous enough, Art chaotic enough, the Tower catastrophicenough, the Star despondent enough, the Moon deceitful enough, the Sunnarcissistic enough, the Aeon destructive enough, or the Universe cold and cruelenough to handle all the evil in the world?It should be obvious that the Devil is something other than the ultimate evil.That something other is just what his full title proclaims. He is Lord of theGates of Matter. That, in itself, can be pretty scary, especially if you've beenconvinced that earthly life is somehow an estrangement from God, and that allthings on the material plane, including you and me, are inherently evil. Growup!Whatever the supreme being is, it would not be the supreme being if it weren'teverything, including you and me—and the Devil. It seems pretty obvious that theDevil is just God as misunderstood by the ignorant and wicked. Crowley explainsit like this:This card represents creative energy in its most material form; in the Zodiac,Capricornus occupies the Zenith. It is the most exalted of the signs; it is thegoat leaping with lust upon the summits of earth…. In this sign, Mars isexalted, showing in its best form the fiery, material energy of creation. Thecard represents Pan Pangenetor, the Al-Begetter.132 [notes.xhtml#f2t132]Crowley tells us elsewhere, that the Fool, the Hermit, and the Devil, “offer athreefold explanation of the male creative energy; but this card (The Devil)especially represents the masculine energy at its most masculine.”133[notes.xhtml#f2t133] Masculine energy at its most masculine, indeed! Look at thecard! I don't have to draw you a picture; Lady Harris could hardly have beenmore explicit. The whole card is the Devil. A magnificent three-eyed Himalayangoat stands before a tree and its two great transparent globular roots. Perhapsmost interesting are the figures in the testes.In traditional tarot decks, the Devil trump shows a woman and a man standingbeneath the Devil in curious attitudes of worship and bondage. These figures aretranslated in the Harris painting as four female forms in the left testicle andfour male forms in the right. The top male form bears the classic horned head ofthe Devil, who appears to have fought his way to the top. The pairs of brokenlines are insinuative of chromosomes, and the starry rays at the equator of theglobes suggest cellular division. This is the Devil the world has been taught tofear. He is life itself, unrestrained, in mad love and seeking to grow and unitewith absolutely everything.The formula of this card is then the complete appreciation of all existingthings. He rejoices in the rugged and the barren no less than in the smooth andthe fertile. Al things equally exalt him. He represents the finding of ecstasyin every phenomenon, however naturally repugnant; he transcends all limitations;he is Pan; he is All.134 [notes.xhtml#f2t134]In The Wake World,, Crowley spins a charming fairytale of a little girl'sinitiatory trip up the Tree of Life. Her name is Lola, and her guide is her HolyGuardian Angel, whom she calls her Fairy Prince. When they reach path 26 (thatof Ayin and the Devil) they attend a strange banquet on a desolate heath.It was midnight, and the Devil came down and sat in the midst; but my FairyPrince whispered: “Hush! it is a great secret, but his name is Yeheswah, and heis the Saviour of the World.” And that was very funny, because the girl next tome thought it was Jesus Christ, till another Fairy Prince (my Prince's brother)whispered as he kissed her: “Hush! tell nobody ever, that is Satan, and he isthe Saviour of the World.”135 [notes.xhtml#f2t135]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------ATU XVI THE TOWERThe Lord of the Hosts of the Mighty Planetary Trump of MarsOriginal Design: A tower struck by forked lightning.

In the firstphase, the land is cleared by smoke-belching bulldozers. Trees are ruthlesslyripped from their roots. Grass and vegetation is plowed under and raked away,then cut up or burned. It is a scene of utter destruction and desolation. If youwere to take a photograph of the site at the end of phase one, you would have apicture of a catastrophe. However, in a year or two, the picture changes.Construction has taken place, and now there stands a magnificent building,landscaped with grass and trees and flowers, and perhaps a beautiful littlewaterfall and lake with a swan or two.In the Thoth Tarot, phase one is represented by Atu XVI, the Tower, and phasetwo is represented by Atu XX, the Aeon. The Tower is not the end of the world;it just looks like the end of the world. It is, quite simply, what Crowley calls“the manifestation of cosmic energy in its grossest form.”139[notes.xhtml#f2t139]The Tower is the planetary trump of Mars, and it incorporates most of the imagesthat characterize traditional versions—;a blasted tower with human figuresfalling from it. Most older versions, however, show the tower being struck bylightning from above, as if by some heavenly wrath. In Harris's vision, thetower is blasted from below by flames belching from the mouth of the underworld(The Hebrew letter Pé means mouth). This is a most significant reverse insymbolic imagery. Another feature unique to the Harris version is the presenceof a large eye at the top of the card that seems to radiate a zigzag oflightning or fire that may be the spark that has ignited the flames from themouth below.In The Book of Thoth, this eye, which Crowley refers to alternately as the Eyeof Horus and the Eye of Shiva, causes him to wax quite philosophic. He eventeases us with comments relating to sex magick and the eye:There is a special technical magical meaning, which is explained openly only toinitiates of the Eleventh degree of the O.T.O.; a grade so secret that it is noteven listed in the official documents. It is not even to be understood by studyof the Eye in Atu XV. Perhaps it is lawful to mention that the Arab sages andthe Persian poets have written, not always guardedly, on the subject.140[notes.xhtml#f2t140]If all this “eye” stuff is so secret, why even bring up the subject? This is anextremely narrow and esoteric reference that Crowley knew full well would not beunderstood or appreciated by the vast majority of readers. Obviously, the eyesrefer to various body openings and the psychic centers to which they are linked.While al this is very interesting from a clinical sex-magick point of view, itreally doesn't help us too much in understanding the general meaning of thistrump. The concept of the Eye of Shiva, on the other hand, does.The Hindu Trinity of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva respectively create, sustain, anddestroy the universe. Shiva is the God of Destruction and, to destroy theuniverse, Crowley, warns, he need only open his eye.Shiva is represented as dancing upon the bodies of his devotees. To understandthis is not easy for most western minds. Briefly, the doctrine is that theultimate reality (which is Perfection) is Nothingness. Hence al manifestations,however glorious, however delightful, are stains. To obtain perfection, allexisting things must be annihilated.141 [notes.xhtml#f2t141]The traditional title of the Tower is “The House of God,” or “Destruction of theHouse of God.” In chapter I [chap1.xhtml], verse 57, of The Book of the Law, thegoddess Nuit makes a direct reference:Invoke me under my stars! Love is the law, love under will. Nor let the foolsmistake love; for there are love and love. There is the dove, and there is theserpent. Choose ye well! He, my prophet, hath chosen, knowing the law of thefortress, and the great mystery of the House of God.We see the dove and the serpent near the great eye at the top of the card. Thedove has an olive branch in its mouth. Crowley desribes the image like this:The Serpent is portrayed as the Lion-Serpent Xnoubis or Abraxas. These representthe two forms of desire; what Schopenhauer would have called the Will to Liveand the Will to Die. They represent the feminine and masculine impulses; thenobility of the latter is possibly based upon recognition of the futility of theformer. This is perhaps why the renunciation of love in al the ordinary sensesof the word has been so constantly announced as the first step towardsinitiation. This is an unnecessarily rigid view. This Trump is not the only cardin the Pack, nor are the “will to live” and the “will to die” incompatible.142[notes.xhtml#f2t142]Placed in perspective, this is not such a bad card after al. The citizen of theAeon of Horus is no longer to fear natural processes depicted in the Tower. Whenthe Duquette's own Crowned and Conquering Child (our son, Jean-Paul) was fouryears old, he asked me what will eventually happen to the world. I told him thatnobody knows for sure, but that the Hindus worship a God called Shiva who isresponsible for destroying the universe. ''Al Shiva has to do is open his eye,”I said, “and the universe is completely destroyed. What do you think of that?”Without a moment's hesitation he answered, “Then he closes his other eye.”I'm still thinking about that.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------ATU XVII THE STARThe Daughter of the FirmamentThe Dweller between the WatersZodiacal Trump of AquariusSaturn Rules, Neptune ExaltedOriginal Design: The figure of a water-nymph disporting herself.

To trulyappreciate its secrets, one must be familiar with the contents of that chapterand cognizant of its possible meanings. The central subject is Nuit (Nuith)herself. Here, she is not pictured as the infinite arch of the night sky (as wesee her on the Stèle or Atu X, the Aeon), but tangibly personified as abeautiful goddess.The three seven-pointed stars that populate this card are versions of the Starof Babalon, and reveal to us (if we haven't already figured it out) that Nuitand Babalon are, to Crowley, two aspects of the same goddess: “Babalon,” hetells us, “is yet a further materialization of the original idea of Nuith; sheis the Scarlet Woman, the sacred Harlot who is the lady of Atu XI.”146[notes.xhtml#f2t146] He also refers to the seven-pointed star as “the Star ofVenus, as if declaring the principal characteristic of her nature to beLove.”147 [notes.xhtml#f2t147]The abode of Babalon/Nuit on the Tree of Life is the third sephira, Binah, theSupernal Sother. In the great name, Yod Hé Vau Hé, the mother is the first Hé.It makes perfect sense to attribute Hé to this trump, which presents the sublimeimage of the goddess of infinite space.The Harris Star is very faithful to the original description (see above). Sheeven includes the roses and butterflies (seen in the lower right corner) thatare absent in more traditional decks. The river, which is a bit hard to see,flows at the bottom of the card and is demarcated by hills on the distant shore.Perhaps the most exciting departure from the traditional versions of the Star isthe huge celestial globe that dominates the card. This globe is often mistakenlyidentified as the Earth. If it were the Earth, it would dramatically diminishthe spiritual and cosmic scale of this card.The celestial globe represents the entire heavens surrounding the Earth.Therefore, al other images on this card that are placed outside of the celestialsphere must represent spiritual environments that transcend even the concept ofinfinite space. The largest and smallest of the three stars are found outsidethe celestial sphere: the former spins counterclockwise like a cosmic pinwheelin the upper left corner of the card; the latter tumbles clockwise like a tinystar-seed from the golden bowl in the goddess's right hand. The third starwhirls counterclockwise on the celestial sphere itselfThe two cups in her hands, Crowley writes, are fashioned as breasts, “as it iswritten, ‘the milk of the stars from her paps; yea, the milk of the stars fromher paps.”' “From the golden cup,” he continues, “she pours this ethereal water,which is also milk and oil and blood, upon her own head, indicating the eternalrenewal of the categories, the inexhaustible possibilities of existence.”148[notes.xhtml#f2t148] Crowley completes the description thus:The left hand, lowered, holds a silver cup, from which also she pours theimmortal liquor of her life. (This liquor is the Amrita of the Indianphilosophers, the Nepenthe and Ambrosia of the Greeks, the Alkahest andUniversal Medicine of the Alchemists, the Blood of the Grail; or, rather, thenectar which is the mother of that blood.”148 [notes.xhtml#f2t148]Traditionally, the Star is the card of hope—the promise of things unseen. Whatis the hope that Nuit offers us? What is the promise of our star goddess? I wishI could simply reprint the entire first chapter [chap1.xhtml] of The Book of theLaw and show you, but this short excerpt might give you some idea:I give unimaginable joys on earth: certainty, not faith, while in life, upondeath; peace unutterable, rest, ecstasy; nor do I demand aught in sacrifice.149[notes.xhtml#f2t149]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------ATU XVIII THE MOONThe Ruler of the Flux and RefluxThe Child of the Sons of the MightyZodiacal Trump of PiscesJupiter Rules—Venus ExaltedOriginal Design: The waning Moon. Below, a path leads between two towers,guarded by jackals, from the sea, wherein a Scarabus marcheth landwards.”150[notes.xhtml#f2t150]Hebrew Letter: Qaph (back of head).Tree of Life: Path 29, joining images [images/7.jpg] Netzach—Victory to images[images/10.jpg] Malkuth—Kingdom.Colors: Crimson (ultra Violet); Buff, flecked silver White; Light translucentpinkish Brown; Stone color.images [images/146.jpg]Let the Illusion of the World pass over thee unheeded, as thou goest from theMidnight to the Morning.151 [notes.xhtml#f2t151]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------In this Trump, her lowest avatar, she joins the earthy sphere of Netzach withMalkuth, the moon of witchcraft and abominable deeds. She is the poisoneddarkness which is the condition of the rebirth of light.152 [notes.xhtml#f2t152]There is no doubt about it, this is a spooky card. It represents the light thatdarkness creates. It is the light that illuminates your dreams—;and yournightmares.We recall that the trump attributed to the Moon is Atu II, the Priestess. She isthe waxing Moon and represents Luna in her higher aspect, that of forming a linkbetween the human and the divine. (The path of the Priestess crosses the Abyssand joins Tiphareth and Kether.) Atu XVIII, the Moon, is a very different aspectof Luna, and the most cheerful thing I can think to say about it is, “It willchange.”Now, before many of my brothers and sisters in the Craft take offence, let mehasten to point out that the “witchcraft” Crowley is referring to in the abovequote is not the nature-loving and life-affirming religions of the neopaganmovements that have proliferated around the world since his death in 1947. It ismore the imagined witchcraft spawned in the tortured and obscene fantasies ofthe fanatic witch hunters.The moonlight of Atu XVIII is that which illuminates the phantasmagoricnightmares of al of us who cannot acknowledge the dark horrors of our own fears.The Moon card shows a path through and beyond this nightmare, but it is not aneasy path, and the myths of all ages and cultures prove that this journeythrough “the poisoned darkness” is an obligatory chapter in every hero's quest.As Crowley warns:This path is guarded by Tabu. She is uncleanliness and sorcery. Upon the hillsare the black towers of nameless mystery, of horror and of fear. All prejudice,all superstition, dead tradition and ancestral loathing, all combine to darkenher face before the eyes of men. It needs unconquerable courage to begin totread this path.153 [notes.xhtml#f2t153]Harris's rendering is disturbingly haunting, but it is not too dissimilar to thetraditional image. The path runs between two towers guarded by twin figures ofthe Egyptian god Anubus, god of embalming and guardian of cities of the dead.Poison blood drips from the dying Moon. The creature walking out of the water atthe bottom of the card represents the scarab beetle, symbolic of the Egyptiangod Kephra, who is the god of the Sun at midnight.Traditional decks usually show a crawfish, or even a lobster, instead of thescarab, and the symbolism of the Lord of the Sun at midnight becomes somewhatlost in memories of melted butter. I must confess, Harris's scarab doesn't lookvery scaraby either. In fact, it is a water spider. Nevertheless, it carries theSun out of the dark water and, by doing so, assures us that this awfJ. nightwill eventually come to an end. In The Book of Thoth, Crowley also assures thecourageous seeker in his last words concerning this card:One is reminded of the mental echo of subconscious realization, of that supremeiniquity which mystics have constantly celebrated in their accounts of the DarkNight of the Soul. But the best men, the true men, do not consider the matter insuch terms at all. Whatever horrors may afflict the soul, whatever abominationsmay excite the loathing of the heart, whatever terrors may assail the mind, theanswer is the same at every stage: “How splendid is the Adventure!”154[notes.xhtml#f2t154]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------ATU XIX THE SUNThe Lord of the Fire of the WorldPlanetary Trump of the SunOriginal Design: A Sun.

Thisindicates to me that, deep down inside, all of us are inherently aware that weare ultimately solar beings. Crowley explains:This is one of the simplest of the cards; it represents Heru-ra-ha, the Lord ofthe New Aeon, in his manifestation to the race of men as the Sun spiritual,moral, and physical. He is the Lord of Light, Life, Liberty and Love. This Aeonhas for its purpose the complete emancipation of the human race.158[notes.xhtml#f2t158]That is quite a statement, and I believe Crowley meant every word of it.Whenever I am asked to explain the philosophy or, if you prefer, the religion ofThelema, the first thing I usually tell people is, “It is a modern form of Sunworship.” But then, I am quick to add, “And when I use the word ‘Sun,' I am alsoreferring to myself.”Whether or not Crowley would have agreed with my gross generalization isdebatable. I believe, however, that it does describe in the most primitive termsthe essence of Thelema. Now that human consciousness has been subtly “mutated”with the knowledge that Sun continually exists—that it neither dies at night norplunges toward extinction in the autumn—we as a race are poised to identify ourown consciousness with the same phenomenon. Just as sunlight is perpetual,consciousness is continuous. Death is an illusion every bit as much as night isan illusion. Immortality is simply consciousness of the continuity of existence.Heru-ra-ha is a unique name for the two opposite and equal forms of the Egyptiangod Horus. Hoor-pa-kraat, is the passive, innocent, god of silence and infinitepotential, often portrayed as a baby curled in the fetal position, pressing histhumb or forefinger to his lips. Ra-Hoor-Khut159 [notes.xhtml#f2t159] is theactive, violent, hawk-headed avenger of the gods. Combined under the one nameHeru-ra-ha, they are the divine expression of the passive/active dynamics of theelement Spirit.160 [notes.xhtml#f2t160] Harris depicts the classic Egyptianimages of both these gods in Atu XX, the Aeon.Why should the Sun, the ultimate symbol of unity and singularity in our solarsystem, be identified with this double nature? From time immemorial, thedoctrine of twin suns has bubbled secretly in the sanctuaries of the mysteries.Ancient traditions speak of a twin of Earth's Sun about which it and our entiresolar system rotate in a cycle dance of hundreds of millions of years. EarlyGnostic Christians dubbed Satan the twin of Christ, suggesting a great solarmystery hidden in the relationship.Whatever may have been the original circumstances and motives that created theseancient traditions, modern science affirms that the secret of the Sun is indeedthe perpetual struggle of two titanic forces: the active, thermonuclear processthat burns the Sun's fuel and radiates light and energy outward into space, andthe passive, gravitational presence of the Sun's own mass. The former keeps theSun from collapsing in upon itself; the later keeps the burning processperpetually contained and stable.The twin babies in the Fool card, and the children and the bride and groom inthe Lovers are earlier tarot incarnations of the two dancing children we find inthe Sun card. According to Crowley:They represent the male and female, eternally young, shameless and innocent.They are dancing in the light, and yet they dwell upon the earth. They representthe next stage which is to be attained by mankind, in which complete freedom isalike the cause and the result of the new access of solar energy upon theearth.161 [notes.xhtml#f2t161]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------ATU XX THE AEONThe Spirit of the Primal FireElemental Trump of Fire and of SpiritOriginal Design: Israfel blowing the last trumpet.

Thetraditional design shows the Archangel Israfel blowing his trumpet to announcethe end of the world as the dead arise from their tombs. In chapter 6[chap6.xhtml], which is actually an expanded commentary on this card, Iattempted to explain why Crowley replaced The Last Judgment with the Aeon in theThoth Tarot. The reader who has not yet read that chapter is strongly advised todo so now. I will sum up what I wrote there simply by saying that, according toCrowley, the Last Judgment trump is now obsolete. The event that it depicted(the destruction of the world by fire) has already occurred. The world we aretalking about, of course, is the spiritual Age of Osiris. the Aeon card of theThoth Tarot depicts the spiritual forces that initiated the next age, the Aeonof Horus.Crowley saw this event as a magical changing-of-the guard that was foreshadowedsymbolically by one of the regular seasonal ceremonies of the Golden Dawn. Everysix months, the ritual officers of that order were ceremonially promoted onechair up, and new secret passwords were issued. In that ritual, the officer whohad formerly served as second-in-command (who, in that position, had magicallyassumed the identity of the Egyptian God Horus) was installed to serve asHierophant (symbolized by Osiris) for the next six months. The Book of the Lawcalls the cosmic version of this ceremony The Equinox of the Gods.Horus is the God of Force and Fire, and his ascension as Lord of the New Aeonspiritually destroys the old world by fire. It only looks like the end of theworld to those of us who cannot accept the possibility that old spiritual pointsof view can ever be replaced by new ones.As we learned in chapter 5 [chap5.xhtml], Crowley asserted that the latestEquinox of the Gods took place on March 20, 1904 E.v. in Cairo. Triggering theevents that led up to this moment was the psychic possession of Crowley's wife,Rose, and their discovery of a twenty-fifth dynasty funeral stèle. Among manyother features, the stèle shows the God Horus (Ra-Hoor-Khuit) on a throne.Before him is a table of offerings. Standing beside the table is the deceased,Ankh-af-na-Khonsu.Nuit (Nut), the goddess of the night sky and infinite space, arches her bodyover the entire top section of the stèle. Directly beneath her heart is a wingedsolar disk that The Book of the Law refers to as the god Hadit.In Atu XX, the Aeon, Harris interprets the stèle in one of the most colorful andaesthetically pleasing of all the trumps. The Goddess Nuit, her body filled withstars, her breasts alive with the milk of whirling galaxies, forms a beautifulblue omega as she bends in ecstasy around an immense egg containing the seatedimage of Ra-Hoor-Khuit. He holds the phoenix wand in his right hand. His lefthand is empty. Standing as a transparent essence before Ra-Hoor-Khuit is histwin, Hoor-pa-kraat (see the Sun), his finger at his lips in the sign ofsilence. His head is shaven (except for his Horus lock) and crowned with twoUraeus serpents.The God Hadit, pictured as the winged solar disk, is nearly camouflaged by theentire scene. This is most appropriate, for these are among his open words inThe Book of the Law:In the sphere I am everywhere the centre, as she, the circumference, is nowherefound. Yet she shall be known & I never. 165 [notes.xhtml#f2t165]The Hebrew letter Shin is assigned to the Aeon, and a large Shin containingthree embryonic figures appears at the bottom of the card. It fames in front ofa very stylized set of scales, perhaps pointing to the Aeon that will follow theAeon of Horus, that of Maat, the goddess of justice and balance.Crowley ends his discussion of this card with a comparison of the world eventsof approximately two thousand years ago, at the advent and birth of the lastAeon. His words carry a chilling but ultimately hopeful message:The time for the birth of an Aeon seems to be indicated by great concentrationof political power with the accompanying improvements in the means of travel andcommunication, with a general advance in philosophy and science, with a generalneed of consolidation in religious thought. It is very instructive to comparethe events of the five hundred years preceding and following the crisis ofapproximately 2,000 years ago, with those of similar periods centred in 1904 ofthe old era. It is though far from comforting to the present generation, that500 years of Dark Ages are likely to be upon us. But if the analogy holds, thatis the case. Fortunately, to-day we have brighter torches and moretorch-bearers.166 [notes.xhtml#f2t166]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------ATU XXI THE UNIVERSEThe Great One of the Night of TimePlanetary Trump of SaturnElemental Trump of EarthOriginal Design: Should contain a demonstration of the Quadrature of the Circle.An ellipse, composed of 400 lesser circles.

It is without question one of the most recognizable cards ofthe Thoth Tarot. Familiar as it is to us, it is one of the most complex andmysterious cards in the deck. There are several elements in the card I don'tunderstand at all. For instance, what is the black crescent-shaped object in thegoddess's right hand? I don't have a clue. I can't find any reference to it inThe Book of Thoth. If Crowley explains it in any other writings, I confess ithas escaped me completely. My best guess is that it is a sickle (not aninappropriate weapon for a Saturnian goddess). It looks like she is sticking thesharp end right in the middle of the big eye at the top of the card, perhapscausing it to erupt in glories of light—but I can't say for sure.There are several other images in the card that I didn't see until I had thecard enlarged and enhanced. I'll talk about those in a moment. First, let'sstart with what we know from Crowley's own comments:In the card itself there is consequently a glyph of the completion of the GreatWork in its highest sense, exactly as the Atu of the Fool symbolizes itsbeginning. The Fool is the negative issuing into manifestation; the Universe isthat manifestation, its purpose accomplished, ready to return. The twenty cardsthat lie between these two exhibit the Great Work and its agents in variousstages. The image of the Universe in this sense is accordingly that of a maiden,the final letter of the Tetragrammaton170 [notes.xhtml#f2t170]Atu XXI, the Universe, represents both the planet Saturn and the element earth.We already know earth is in some ways a real second-class citizen in theQalistic universe. We also know that because earth is lowest, it ironicallyplays a pivotal role in the cosmic scheme of things.Saturn is also very special. As Binah's representative, it is the only planetarysphere above the Abyss. In many ways, it is the highest of the high. At the sametime, on the Tree of Life, the path of the Universe (32) leads from Yesod (theninth and last true sephira on the Tree) down into Malkuth (which is onlypendant to the Tree, a cosmic dingleberry). How strange that the highest highand the lowest low would be represented by the same card. The Universe mustindeed hold many mysteries, something Crowley confirms in this passage:The first and most obvious characteristic of this card is that it comes at theend of all, and is therefore the complement of the Fool. It is attributed to theletter Tau. The two cards together accordingly spell the word Ath, which meansEssence. All reality is consequently compromised in the series of which thesetwo letters form the beginning and the end. This beginning was Nothing; the endmust therefore be also Nothing, but Nothing in its complete expansion, as waspreviously explained. 171 [notes.xhtml#f2t171]As we see from the original description, Atu XXI, the Universe, should contain ademonstration of the “Quadrature of the Circle.” Good Luck! For centuries, ithas been the quest of mystic mathematicians to square the circle or construct,by using only a compass and a straight edge, a square of precisely the samecircumference as that of any given circle. It would be the geometric equivalentof building the New Jerusalem—the marriage of the eternal circle of heaven tothe terrestrial square of Earth.In 1882, German mathematician Carl Louis Ferdinand von Lindemann finallydemonstrated that the perfect squaring of the circle is a mathematicalimpossibility. However, thousands of years of attempting the impossible hasproduced a body of graphic and architectural devices that have supplied thepatterns and proportions for temples and cathedrals, sacred statuary, andpaintings. It has also provided us with the blueprint for Atu XXI, the Universe.Bold seekers have also introduced into this quest collateral data, such as themysterious numbers that appear in the Old and New Testaments, and the estimatedsize and ratios of planetary orbits. The mental stimulation and ecstasy suchmathematical gymnastics induce can be addictive, to the point of triggeringemotional instability. British architect, William Stirling, author of themonumental work The Canon: An Exposition of the Pagan Mystery Perpetuated in theCabala as the Rule of All the Arts, died most hideously while attempting tosever his own head from his body.172 [notes.xhtml#f2t172] (One can think toomuch about such things.)I confess that I become hopelessly lost whenever I try to follow the logic andnumbers of transcendental mathematics. What I do understand is the aestheticbeauty of the figures such musings produce when translated into graphic designs,especially the diagram called, appropriately, the New Jerusalem. Because Icannot explain exactly why this diagram is an attempt to square the circle, Iwill instead try to show you how it is constructed and allow you decide whetheror not to pursue its mysteries further. (But, please, try not to lose yourhead!)The New Jerusalem and the Universe trump both start with a special oval called avesicapiscis (a fish bladder). We see the vesica in two places on the Universecard: as the large oval that touches the top, bottom, and sides of the card, andas the eye at the top right section of the large vesica. The small eye vesicaappears either to be projecting the images on to the card, or drawing them allback inside itself.It is very easy to create a vesica piscus, and the beginning of its constructionemploys Qabalistic concepts that by now should be familiar to you.1. First, you must have two circles of equal size that intersect at theircenters. (The first circle is Kether, which unites with its reflection, Chokmah,to create the opening, the Yoni of Mother Binah from which will issue alcreation). The vesica was the floor plan of many cathedrals of the lateRenaissance and early Baroque periods, structures that were nearly all dedicatedto Our Lady.images [images/156.jpg]2. Next, enclose and center the vesica inside a third circle the same size asthe other two (It is as though the supernal triad has made and positioned thevesica). It looks like an eye, doesn't it?images [images/1561.jpg]3. Enclose the vesica with a square that is the same length and breadth as thelength of the vesica.images [images/1562.jpg]4. Draw four circles at the diagonal corners whose centers intersect the greatcircle, and whose circumferences touch the vesica.images [images/157.jpg]5. Finally, enclose all with in a square.images [images/157h.jpg]There it is. This is the basic model for both the traditional and theCrowley-Harris versions of the Universe. You may also recognize this design aspattern for many paintings and stained-glass windows that depict Christ, or theHoly Family, or the Trinity surrounded by the images of the angel or man, thelion, the bull, and the eagle. In the Harris-Crowley card, the four Kerubiccreatures are placed in the corners in the same manner as in the Hierophant.For reasons that have never been very clear to me, Christian believers are toldthese creatures represent respectively the four Evangelists: Mathew, Mark, Luke,and John. Jews naturally recognize them as the symbols for the four tribes ofIsrael, who were assigned the corner positions in the camp of the Israelites:173 [notes.xhtml#f2t173] the man of the tribe of Reuben, the lion ofJudah, the bull of Ephriam, and the eagle of Dan. We, of course, recognize themas the four Kerubic beasts.Even though the original description states the vesica should be an ellipsecomposed of 400 lesser circles (a reference to the Hebrew letter Tau assigned tothis card, which enumerates to 400), Lady Harris does well to give usseventy-two circles174 [notes.xhtml#f2t174] (yes, I counted them), whichprovocatively suggest (to me at least) the ribbed skeleton of an infinitely hugeserpent.Now that we know that Lady Harris gave it the old college try to squaring thecircle, let's get out our magnifying glass and look at the all the wonderfulthings she puts inside it. At the bottom point of the vesica is a skeletalstructure that looks a bit like the blueprint of a building. That is exactlywhat it is—it is the house of matter. If the structure were projected in threedimensions, we would see a four-sided building and that each of the tinyvertical lines represents one of the ninety-two then known elements. They areingeniously arranged in hierarchical order and joined by a series of diagonallines that form a diagram of the chemical building blocks of the materialuniverse. The model for this design first appeared in The Bases of ModernScience, by J. W. N. Sullivan.175 [notes.xhtml#f2t175]Impressive as this diagram is, Harris superimposes it upon a structure even moremagnificent and mysterious. If you look carefully, you will see that Sullivan'shouse of matter is projected upon the largest of three pyramids suggestive ofthose at the Giza complex. Like the Great Pyramid at Giza, the apex of the largepyramid in the center of Harris's drawing is also covered with finishing stones,making it appear to swell a bit at the top.Crowley makes no reference to these pyramids in The Book of Thoth, and my poormind boggles at the possible implications. He does mention something we can'tsee—at least I can't see it:In the centre, a wheel of Light initiates the form of the Tree of Life, shewingthe ten principal bodies of the solar system. But this Tree is not visibleexcept to those of wholly pure heart. 176 [notes.xhtml#f2t176]Well I guess I'm busted! Emperor Lon has no clothes! As if I really need theMaster Therion to tell me I'm not wholly pure of heart! I'm really not surprisedI can't see his damned Tree of Life in the center of this card.What I can see is a beautiful green sphere upon which sits a complex Möbiusstrip.177 [notes.xhtml#f2t177] Actually, it's not that complex. It's just aregular Möbius strip made from three half twists rather than just one. (Yes, Imade one to be sure.) The endlessness of a Möbius strip makes it a perfect andbeautiful glyph of the infinite, and it is my guess that Lady Harris replacedCrowley's invisible Tree of Life with this brilliantly appropriate device.The main feature of the card is the beautiful “Little Lady” Crowley refers to inthis passage:In the present card she is represented as a dancing figure. In her hands shemanipulates the radiant spiral force, the active and passive, each possessingits dual polarity. Her dancing partner is shown as Heru-Ra-Ha of Atu XIX.178[notes.xhtml#f2t178]Is she Nuit/Babalon, goddess of the sphere of Saturn, Binah? Or is she thevirgin princess of the sphere of earth, Malkuth? She is, in truth, both thegreat mother and the virgin daughter of eternity.What could possibly serve as the model for this goddess who is at once thebeginning and the end and all things in between? What vision could haveemboldened Lady Harris to give such solid form to this formless and eternalprocess?On the afternoon of December 6, 1909, between the hours of2:00 and 4:15 p.m. ina lonely valley of fine sand in the desert near Bou-Sada, North Mrica, AleisterCrowley, accompanied by the poet Victor Nueberg, who served as his servant andmagical scribe, crossed the Abyss179 [notes.xhtml#f2t179] and experienced theterrible vision of the tenth Enochian Aethyr. The details of this ordeal arechronicled in The Vision and the Voice, 180 [notes.xhtml#f2t180] and remain thecentral features of one of the most breathtaking and remarkable magical visionsever recorded.The next evening, December 7,1909, between 9:30 and 11:10 p.m., while hisconsciousness still thrilled with the bliss of that magical plateau, heexperienced the vision of the next Aethyr, the ninth. I have excerpted a largeportion of that vision, because I believe that there is nothing I or anyone elsecould say about Atu XXI, the Universe, that could be more profound or relevant.It is nothing less than an account of a face-to-face encounter with the goddessof Atu XXI, the Universe.She has very deep eye-lids, and long lashes. Her eyes are closed, or nearlyclosed. It is impossible to say anything about her. She is naked; her whole bodyis covered with fine gold hairs, that are the electric flames that are thespears of mighty and terrible Angels whose breast-plates are the scales of herskin. And the hair of her head, that flows down to her feet, is the very lightof God himself. Of all the glories beheld by the seer in the Aethyrs, there isnot one which is worthy to be compared with her littlest finger-nail. Foralthough he may not partake of the Aethyr, without the ceremonial preparations,even the beholding of this Aethyr from afar is like the partaking of all theformer Aethyrs.The Seer is lost in wonder, which is peace.And the ring of the horizon above her is a company of glorious Archangels withjoined hands, that stand and sing: This is the daughter of BABALON theBeautiful, that she hath borne unto the Father of M. And unto all hath she borneher.This is the Daughter of the King. This is the Virgin of Eternity. This is shethat the Holy One hath wrested from the Giant Time, and the prize of them thathave overcome Space. This is she that is set upon the Throne of Understanding.Holy, Holy, Holy is her name, not to be spoken among men. For Koré they havecalled her, and Malkah, and Betulah, and Persephone.And the poets have feigned songs about her, and the prophets have spoken vainthings, and the young men have dreamed vain dreams; but this is she, thatimmaculate, the name of whose name may not be spoken. Thought cannot pierce theglory that defendeth her, for thought is smitten dead before her presence.Memory is blank, and in the most ancient books of Magick are neither words toconjure her, nor adorations to praise her. Will bends like a reed in thetempests that sweep the borders of her kingdom, and imagination cannot figure somuch as one petal of the lilies whereon she standeth in the lake of crystal, inthe sea of glass.This is she that hath bedecked her hair with seven stars the seven breaths ofGod that move and thrill its excellence. And she hath tired her hair with sevencombs, whereupon are written the seven secret names of God that are not knowneven of the Angels, or of the Archangels, or of the Leader of the armies of theLord.Holy, Holy, Holy art thou, and blessed be Thy name for ever, unto whom the Aeonsare but the pulsings of thy blood.181 [notes.xhtml#f2t181]And so we come to both the end and beginning of the trumps. I know that, formany of you, the trip has been pretty bumpy in spots. Perhaps you think thatyou've bitten off more than you can chew and that you will never completelyunderstand the tarot (especially the Thoth Tarot). You're right. You wil^^ nevercompletely understand. Nobody will. However, you do have the best teacher in theuniverse standing by to be your mentor and guide for all areas of your spirituallife—your Holy Guardian Angel.Here, at the end of our discussion of Atu XXI, on the lowest path on the Tree ofLife, it is especially appropriate that we remember our Holy Guardian Angel,because, whether we are aware of it or not, whether we have achieved knowledgeand conversation of our HGA, or have just begun our initiatory journey, we arehelped at every step of the way.In The Wake World,182 [notes.xhtml#f2t182] at the very beginning of Lola's tripup the Tree of Life, she is frightened when she and her fairy prince (HGA) firstenter path 32, the path of Tau and the Universe. Crowley describes how herGuardian Angel comforts her and gives her the best advice anyone on theinitiatory path can receive:Then he said: “Come on! This is only the Servants' Hall, nearly everybody staysthere all their lives.” And I said: “Kiss me!” So he said: “Every step you takeis only possible when you say that.”183 [notes.xhtml#f2t183]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIFTEENimages [images/im.jpg]THE MINOR ARCANA“Did the Tarot come from playing cards or did playing cards come from theTarot?” “Yes.”184 [notes.xhtml#f2t184]As much as tarot fans would like to believe otherwise, modern playing cards didnot come from the tarot. As a matter of fact, where the fifty-six cards of theLesser Arcana are concerned, tarot came from playing cards. The game was calledMarnluk, and we can easily trace its existence and popularity tofifteenth-century Turkey.Mamluk cards had four suits, each numbered one through ten. The suits displayedimages of polo sticks, cups, swords, and coins. Each suit also had a set ofthree male royalty figures, a King, an Emir, and a Wazir. The appearance ofMamluk cards in Europe in the 1370s predates the earliest known tarot by atleast fifty years.The revelation of lslamic roots of the Lesser Arcana gives ammunition to thosewho would suggest Qabalistic roots to the tarot. Mamluk's introduction to Europealmost certainly came through Moorish Spain, which, at the time, was a hotbed ofQabalistic activity. As I said concerning the Major Arcana, however, nothing canbe proven to suggest anything more occult or mysterious than the naturalcongealing of the conventions of a popular game. Nevertheless, that phenomenonin itself may have profound implications concerning how the human mind ishardwired to respond to archetypal images."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXTEENimages [images/im.jpg]THE SPIRIT OF THE ACESThe Aces represent the roots of the four elements. They are quite above, anddistinct from, the other small cards in the same way as Kether is said to besymbolized only by the topmost point of the god of Tetragrammaton. In thesecards is no real manifestation of the element in its materialform. They form alink between the small cards and the Princesses, who rule the Heavens around theNorth Pole…both in their appearance and in their meaning, the Aces are not theelements themselves, but the seeds of those elements.185 [notes.xhtml#f2t185]You may think it odd that I begin my examination of the fifty-six cards of theMinor Arcana by first examining the four aces instead of the court cards. Afterall, aren't the aces simply the first of the small cards? I hope I didn't hearanyone ask that question. To say the ace is just the lowest-numbered tarot smallcard of its suit is like saying Kether is just the first sephira on the Tree ofLife.Ultimately, there are not fifty-six cards in the Minor Arcana of the tarot.There are only four—the four aces. The other fifty-two cards (the sixteen courtcards and the thirty-six small cards), live inside the four aces. As we learnedin chapter 8 [chap8.xhtml], if we look at the ace of any suit under a magicmicroscope, we first see the four court cards of that suit living comfortablyinside. Let's not stop there. If we increase the magnification level of ourmicroscope, we see that the nine small cards of the suit are nestled neatlyinside in three rows of three cards. Isn't that tidy?What does Crowley mean when he tells us that the aces are not the elementsthemselves, but the seeds of those elements? Qabalistically, the most obviousanswer deals with the fact that Kether, the first sephira of the Tree of Life,is the inscrutable singularity of its particular world. As head honcho of thesupernal triad, it is above, and distinct from, the other sephiroth thatactually do all the manifesting in (and of) their respective worlds. Isn't thatexplanation kind of a cop-out, however? It sounds as if I'm just trying toexplain something that is impossible to understand by giving an example ofsomething else that is impossible to understand.images [images/163.jpg]FIGURE 26.

They go as far as totell us that the components of atoms (subatomic particles like protons,electrons, neutrons, and other strange things like quarks, and charm andquark-gluon plasma) aren't matter at all, but can only be described asnonmaterial “tendencies.”What a perfect description of Kether! What a perfect description of the ace! Itis that supremely fundamental tendency underlying a particular element. The Aceof Wands is not fire, but the tendency, or grouping of tendencies, to be fireand the suit of Wands.Physicists theorize that these tendencies likely existed in their pure state innature under conditions of extreme heat such as might have existed in the firstmilliseconds after the Big Bang. Accurately or inaccurately, the words these menand women of science are currently tossing about to describe thesepremanifestation tendencies that floated free in the immeasurable heat ofcreation are enough to make mystics of all schools stand up and salute: wordslike dark matter, mana, urmatter, quintessence, and (are you ready for this?)spirit!186 [notes.xhtml#f2t186]Tarot trump XX, the Aeon, represents the element of spirit. But, as we will see,it also does double duty on the Tree of Life and in tarot by representing theelement fire. Perhaps this is the tarot's way of pointing to spirit's primordialhome in the fire of creation itself, and how the aces can be the root of theirelement yet, as Crowley tells us, “quite above, and distinct from, the othersmall cards.”187 [notes.xhtml#f2t187]As we know, each ace enjoys a unique and very important relationship with thePrincess of its suit. We touched on that relationship in chapters 8[chap8.xhtml] and 11 [chap11.xhtml]. The Princess is the throne of her ace and,when we consider one, we must by necessity think of the other. Hopefully, thisconnection will become clearer when we examine the court cards and small cards.In some card games, aces are considered just the cards that come before the twosin value. In tarot, the aces are the gods of their suits and deserve some realrespect.

Three flames issue from the ends of the right andleft branch, and four flames from the top central branch. The whole issurrounded by twenty-two red flames or Yods arranged as to suggest the paths onthe Tree of Life.Color: Brilliance.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------This card represents the essence of the element of Fire it its inception. It isa solar-phallic outburst of flame from which spring lightnings in everydirection.189 [notes.xhtml#f2t189]If that was how Crowley described his vision of this card to Harris, then wewill have to admit that she did a magnificent job. The Golden Dawn model is morecomplex than its description might suggest. Some renditions I've seen are almostcomical in their attempt to fulfill all the required images. Harris throws themall out the window and gives us the image of a huge Tree of Life ablaze with tenflaming sephiroth.In a very real way, this image is telling us that, just as all the sephiroth ofall four Trees of Life are only aspects of the one supreme Kether, just as allfour Qabalistic worlds are really only aspects of the highest world, just as theHe and the Vau and the final He of YHVH are really only aspects of the Yod, allthe cards of the Minor Arcana ultimately live inside one card, the Ace of Wands.Of course, it takes a Buddha to actually grasp that concept. It also leaves uswith a pretty thin deck of tarot cards to play with. It's probably better for usto go along with the Qabalistic drill and view this card as representing Kether,of the Tree of Life that represents the highest of the Qabalistic worlds,Atziluth. That's a heavy enough concept as it is.This card is the masculine compliment of the Ace of Cups and is derived from theLingam and the Sun exactly as the Ace of Cups is from the Yoni and the Moon.190[notes.xhtml#f2t190]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------ACE OF CUPSimages [images/4.jpg]With the Princess of Cups as its throne, the Ace of Cups rules theLibra-Scorpio-Sagittarius quadrant above the North Pole, and the area of thePacific.Original Title: The Root of the Powers of the Waters.Golden Dawn Model: A hand appears from clouds at the bottom of the cardsupporting on its palm the cup of the Stolistes from which gush fountains ofwater.

In Wagnerian terms,it is the Holy Grail to the Ace of Wands' sacred lance. The Golden Dawn modelhas more or less been discarded, and Crowley's description in The Book of Thothis that of an earlier draft of this card, not Harris's finished product. Thisis, nonetheless, one of, if not the, most beautiful cards in the entire deck.Scalloped radiations of light burst from the cup to meet and match theundulating waves of water at the horizon of the sea. Harris repeats the motif ofscallops in the dress of the Princess of Cups, suggesting perhaps herrelationship as throne of the ace.The cup itself is a simple blue bowl with what appear to be two blue-greenentwined serpents serving as handles. For reasons that are not altogether clearto me, Harris has placed three interlaced rings (the same as those that crownedthe Hierophant's wand in Atu V) on the front of the cup. This symbol, whichCrowley described as “representative of the three Aeons of lsis, Osiris andHorus with their interlocking magical formulae”192 [notes.xhtml#f2t192] is notto be confused with the more complex Mark of the Beast, which we find on the Aceof Disks and the Prince and Five of Wands. One can only speculate why Harris wasmoved to apply this symbol to the cup.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------ACE OF SWORDSimages [images/5.jpg]With the Princess of Swords as its throne, the Ace of Swords rules theCapricorn-Aquarius-Pisces quadrant above the North Pole and the area of theAmericas.Original Title: The Root of the Powers of the Air.Golden Dawn Model: A hand appears from clouds at the bottom of the card holdingthe hilt of a great sword that penetrates at its point a radiant crown. An olivebranch hangs from the right of the crown, a palm branch from the left. SixHebrew Vaus fall from the sword point upon the top of the crown.Color: White Brilliance.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Ace of Swords is the primordial Energy of Air, the Essence of the Vau of theTetragrammaton, the integration of the Ruach.193 [notes.xhtml#f2t193]The Ace of Swords is the root of the element air and represents the Ruach. Ruachis the intellect part of the soul, and (according to Eastern mystics) the mindis the great enemy. The mind violently resists identification with any higherlevels of consciousness. Consequently, from out of the mind springs conflict,frustration, anxiety, worry, and sorrow. Is it any wonder the suit of Swords isfilled with so many unpleasant cards? However, in the proper hands, the swordcan be the weapon that cuts through the crap, and the Ace of Swords is the swordof the Magus, “crowned with the 22 rayed diadem of pure Light.”194[notes.xhtml#f2t194] In Magick, Liber ABA, Book Four, Crowley describes thesword. I can offer no better description of this card.The hilt of the Sword should be made of copper. The guard is composed of the twocrescents of the waxing and the waning Moon-back to back. Spheres are placedbetween them, forming an equilateral triangle with the sphere of the pommel. Theblade is straight, pointed, and sharp right up to the guard. It is made of steelto equilibrate with the hilt, for steel is the metal of Mars, as copper is ofVenus…The hilt is Venus, for Love is the motive of this ruthless analysis-ifthis were not so the Sword would be a Black Magical weapon. The pommel of theSword is in Daäth, the guard extends to Chesed and Geburah; the point is inMalkuth.195 [notes.xhtml#f2t195]Upon the blade, Harris has engraved, in Greek, the word Thelema (Will) in ArabicDamascened work.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------ACE OF DISKSimages [images/6.jpg]With the Princess of Disks as its throne, the Ace of Disks rules theAries-Taurus-Gemini quadrant above the North Pole, and the area of Europe andMrica.Original Title: The Root of the Powers of the Earth.Golden Dawn Model: A hand appears from clouds at the bottom of the card holdingthe branch of a rose tree surmounted by a large disk composed of five concentriccircles. The center is white, is adorned with a red Greek cross, and radiatestwelve white rays that reach to the inner edge of the disk. Above this is acircled Maltese Cross with two white wings.Color: White, flecked Gold.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Steal not this Book for fear of shame!The Ace of Disks—the Author's name.196 [notes.xhtml#f2t196]To represent the root of the element earth and the material world Assiah, LadyHarris gives us the ultimate coin of the realm centered upon money-green layersof the vegetal embellishments that historically have adorned the world's papercurrency.A tarot tradition dating back to sixteenth-century Italy (where decks of cardswere stamped and taxed by local authorities) dictates that the creator of thedeck place his or her mark or signature on the Two or the Ace of Disks. Crowleywas obviously aware of this tradition, and I think we can be confident that hesupervised its execution very carefully. The Ace of Disks is nothing less thanCrowley's own magical signature. His motto, TO META images[images/187.jpg]HEPION To Mega Therion, Greek for the Great Beast, is displayedon the perimeter of the disk, and his personal seal is placed in the very centerof all.A decagon fits snugly within the outer ring and seems to create ten facets thatreach toward the center and curiously end at the points of two five-sidedpolygons. Within the two polygons is a heptagram (Thelema's Star of Babalon),and within the heptagram we find the Mark of the Beast.The Mark of the Beast is made up of three intersecting circles. The uppermostcircle contains a dot at its center, creating the astrological symbol of theSun. Cradling the Sun circle from below is an upturned crescent Moon. Together,they are the Sun and Moon conjoined, the symbol of so many things that I wouldbe an idiot to even start a footnote. The number 666, the number of the Sun andof the Beast is written across the two lower circles. This symbol is rich inmagical and Qabalistic symbolism. One can also, with very little imagination,see a bird's-eye view of the three main characters of male genitalia. PerfectCrowley!"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTEENimages [images/2.jpg]THE CRAZY MIXED-UP WORLD OF COURT CARDSThe convenience of these arrangements is that these cards are suitable as beingdescriptive, in a rough and empirical fashion, of divers types of men and women.One may say briefly that any of these cards is a picture of the person whoseSun, or whose rising sign at his nativity, falls within the Zodiacal attributionof the card.197 [notes.xhtml#f2t197]We tend to treat the four aces as if they were each the pure representatives oftheir element. That is not altogether correct. It is true that they are thepurest representatives of their element, but, if they did not contain someminute quantities (and qualities) of the other three elements, they would beunable to combine to form the matter and energy that creates and sustains thephenomenal universe. Simply put, there would be no creation at all if theindividual elements remained pure and set completely apart from one another.Water would not be able to combine with air if it didn't have a bit of airalready in it to serve as an attractor, and vice versa. In order to manifest auniverse, things have to be shaken up. The court cards make four very mixed-upfamilies.MIX-UP #1: SIXTEEN SUBELEMENTSRemember that, when we put an ace under our magick microscope, we saw the fourcourt cards of the suit living inside? As the four aces represent the fourelements of fire, water, air, and earth, the four court cards in each suitrepresent the same four elements in subdivisions of their suit. The Knights arethe fire subdivision; the Queens are the water subdivision; the Princes are theair subdivision; and the Princesses are the earth subdivision. This gives ussixteen members of the court-card family and sixteen subelementalcharacteristics that Crowley identifies as types of human beings.Modern tarot scholars, in particular Linda Gail Walters,198 [notes.xhtml#f2t198]have done a remarkable job of applying the Jungian personality types as definedby the famous Myers-Briggs type indicators199 [notes.xhtml#f2t199] to thesixteen court cards. So has psychologist Arthur Rosengarten, who, in hisgroundbreaking text, Psychology and Tarot,200 [notes.xhtml#f2t200] discussesthese same parallels. I firmly believe that, had the Myers-Briggs concepts beenavailable to Crowley at the time of his writing The Book of Thoth, he would mostcertainly have referred to them, because they bolster his own theoriesconcerning the personality characteristics of the court cards.Just as each of our personalities has been molded by an elaborate mixture offactors, including genetics, environment, education, and experience, so eachcourt card is a complex mixture of elemental, planetary, and zodiacal factors.When considering what follows, keep in mind that it is the duty of the elementsto “mix” (see tables 14 [chap19.xhtml#tab14] and 15 [chap19.xhtml#tab15]).MIX-UP #2: PRINCESSES-QUADRANTS OF SPACE—NOT QUADRANTS OF TIMEThe Princesses are the earth subelement of their suits and enjoy a specialrelationship with their aces. For this reason, they are considered separatelyfrom the rest of their families. They and their aces rule quadrants of space(see chapter 11 [chap11.xhtml]).The Ace/Princess of Wands rules the celestial quadrant of Cancer/Leo/Virgo andthe area of Asia; Ace/Princess of Cups rules Libra/Scorpio/Sagittarius and thePacific; Ace/Princess of Swords rules Capricorn/Aquarius/Pisces and the area ofthe Americas; and the Ace/Princess of Disks rules Aries/Taurus/Gemini and theareas of Europe and Africa.MIX-UP #3: KNIGHTS, QUEENS, PRINCES—QUADRANTS OF TIMEEach Knight, Queen, and Prince rule 30° of the zodiacal year. Chauvinistic logicwould suggest that the Knights should predominate in cardinal signs, Queens infixed signs, and Princes in mutable signs of the zodiac—but chauvinistic logicwould be wrong!To mix things up, the knights dominate the mutable signs: (Knight of Wands,Sagittarius; Knight of Cups, Pisces; Knight of Swords, Gemini; Knight of Disks,Virgo). It is the queens who dominate the cardinal signs: (Queen of Wands,Aries; Queen of Cups, Cancer; Queen of Swords, Libra; Queen of Disks,Capricorn). The princes dominate the fixed signs: (Prince of Wands, Leo; Princeof Cups, Scorpio; Prince of Swords, Aquarius; Prince of Disks, Taurus). Verymixed up.MIX-UP #4:KNIGHTS, QUEENS, PRINCES—THE ADOPT-A-NEIGHBOR'S-DECAN PROGRAM201[notes.xhtml#f2t201]The mixing up doesn't end here. You notice that I used the words “predominate”and “dominate,” rather than “rule.”That is because each of these twelve courtcards isn't allowed to completely rule any of the signs of the zodiac; it canonly mostly rule a sign of the zodiac. To be precise, each court card rules from20° of one sign to 20° of the next (see table 14 [chap19.xhtml#tab14]). Eventhough the Knight of Wands dominates the first 20° (or ⅔) of the mutable firesign, Sagittarius, he is also forced by the admixture law of the tarot to backup a bit on the zodiac belt and adopt the last decan (period of 10°) of the signthat preceeds Sagittarius. This means the fiery Knight of Wands has to adopt thelast decan of the fixed water sign, Scorpio.The Queen of Cups dominates the first 20° of the cardinal sign Cancer, but shealso has to play hostess to (and be colored by) the last 10° of the mutable signGemini. This is how the Knights, Queens, and Princes literacy knit the zodiacalyear together.Planets are also assigned to each 10° division (decan) of the zodiac and fartherinfluence the character of these twelve court cards, but I will talk about theplanets in chapter 19 [chap19.xhtml].NOW I'M MIXED UPI know this might at first appear rather complicated and beyond the scope ofinterest of many of you. If that is the case, I commend you for your patienceand willingness to wade through this technical discussion of the complexities ofthe court cards. Please take comfort in the knowledge that, for the moment, itis not as important for you to completely master all these details as it is foryou realize that, if you really wanted to, you could master them.So, as a reward for your forbearance, I'm going to share with you a littleshortcut to understanding the court cards and making them immediately usable ina tarot reading. It starts with Crowley's quote that I used to head thischapter:The convenience of these arrangements is that these cards are suitable as beingdescriptive, in a rough and empirical fashion, of divers types of men and women.One may say briefly that any of these cards is a picture of the person whoseSun, or whose rising sign at his nativity, falls within the Zodiacal attributionof the card.The characteristics of people are a lot easier to remember and understand thanthe theoretical characteristics of Qabalistic and astrological abstractions. Itis enough to remember that each Knight, each Queen, and each Prince issomebody's birthday card. Start with yourself What court card are you? Do mycomments describe you? Do Crowley's? If not, feel free to disregard them andgive that card your own definition, based on what you know about yourself.Next, learn the birthdays of people you know—family members, friends,co-workers, enemies, even celebrities or historical characters about whom youknow a great deal. Using their date of birth, determine which court cards theyare. Chances are that the character traits you and the others exhibit are verysimilar to the classic descriptions of the cards. What if they are not, however?Hey! Maybe the cards are wrong. After all, people are real characters in a realworld; tarot cards are just pieces of painted paper in a box.To prime the pump for this kind of meditation, I have, in discussing the courtcards, included the names of a few stereotypical celebrities and historicalpersonages whose birth dates make them a Knight, Queen, or Prince of theappropriate suit. I realize only too well that these digressions smack ofpop-culture dilettantism, and represent a shocking breach of my vow to keepthings as “Crowley” as possible. To all the Crowley purists who are affronted bythis un-Crowley offering, I offer my sincere apology. To everyone else—have fun.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------KNIGHT OF WANDS FIRE OF FIRE20° Scorpio to 20° SagittariusNovember 13 to December 12Rules 7 of Cups; 8 of Wands; 9 of WandsOriginal Titles: The Lord of the Flame and the Lightning; The King of theSpirits of Fire King of the Salamanders.Crest: Winged black horse's head.Symbols: Black horse, waving flames. Club. Scarlet gold cloak.Hair: Red-gold.Eyes: Grey or Hazel.images [images/175.jpg]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The moral qualities appropriate to this figure are activity, generosity,fierceness, impetuosity, pride, impulsiveness, swiftness in unpredictableactions. If wrongly energized, he is evil-minded, cruel, bigoted and brutal. Heis in either case ill-fitted to carry on his action; he has no means ofmodifying it according to circumstances. If he fails in his first effort, he hasno resource.202 [notes.xhtml#f2t202]Representing fire of fire, the Knight of Wands certainly has the potential ofbeing the strongest member of the court cards. He represents the Yod subdivisionof the Yod (of YHVH.) However, it is well for us to remember that, where courtcards are concerned, representing something is not the same as being something.Harris translates the Golden Dawn description into a magnificent and thrillingimage that almost leaps off the card. Did I say leap? Explodes is perhaps abetter word. The forward thrust of the horse's mane and tail and the hair andbeard of the Knight suggests that they aren't so much in the act of jumping asbeing blown from behind by some unimaginably strong explosive force. It is theportrait of someone who is riding a rocket, and that can be very risky. If therocket isn't aimed properly, he or she misses the target. If there is not enoughfuel, he or she crashes. If there is too much fuel, the person explodes. But ifeverything goes well, it is the most spectacular of successes.Robert Fulton, Indira Gandhi, Robert Kennedy, Frank Sinatra, and Mary Queen ofScots all were Knights of Wands.Fiery reds, yellows, and gold dominate this card as they do all the Wand courtcards.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------QUEEN OF WANDS WATER OF FIRE20° Pisces to 20° AriesMarch 11 to April 10Rules 10 of Cups; 2 of Wands; 3 of WandsOriginal Titles: The Queen of the Thrones of Flame; Queen of the Salamanders.Crest: Winged leopard.Symbols: Leopard. Steady flames. Wand with heavy head or end.Hair: Red-gold.Eyes: Blue or Brown.images [images/176.jpg]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Characteristics of the Queen are adaptability, persistent energy, calmauthority which she knows how to use to enhance her attractiveness. She iskindly and generous, but impatient of opposition. She has immense capacity forfriendship and for love, but always on her own initiative.203[notes.xhtml#f2t203]The top portion of the card projects such a powerful image of supreme femininestrength and nobility that one could easily see it chiseled in stone as thefaçade of a great public building or monument. Unfortunately, beautiful as sheis, she is somewhat of a façade herself. Crowley goes so far as to suggest sheis somewhat of a snob.When H. Rider Haggard wrote the classic science fiction story She, he must havehad the Queen of Wands in mind. The title character is Ayesha, a beautiful,immortal queen who rules a land where she is known as “She Who Must Be Obeyed.”She is a just but ruthless queen who seems to take offense quite easily. Sheloves her people (in a selfish sort of way), but she is so self-absorbed that,when the opportunity for her to experience true love presents itself, shebecomes a cruel, tyrannical, savage monster. This, naturally, results in herunhappiness and eventual destruction. Describing the character represented bythis card, Crowley uses a wonderful expression, “when she misses her bite, shebreaks her jaw!”204 [notes.xhtml#f2t204]But that's the downside of this lovely lady. She also can be everything theworld needs in a strong woman.Actress Ursula Andress, who portrayed Queen Ayesha in the 1965 film She, is aQueen of Wands. So was Joan Crawford (a real-life She Who Must Be Obeyed). Twoother Queens of Wands (whose laws we obey) were Albert Einstein and Wyatt Earp(although, I probably wouldn't have told Wyatt Earp he was the Queen ofanything.)Fiery reds, yellows, and gold dominate this card, as they do all the Wand courtcards.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------PRINCE OF WANDS AIR OF FIRE20° Cancer to 20° LeoJuly 12 to August 11Rules 4 of Cups; 5 of Wands; 6 of WandsOriginal Titles: The Prince of the Chariot of Fire; Prince and Emperor of theSalamanders.Crest: Winged lion's head.Symbols: Wand and salient flames. Fire wand of Zelator Adeptus Minor.Hair: Yellow.Eyes: Blue Grey.images [images/178.jpg]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------He is romantic especially in matters of history and tradition, to the point offolly, and may engineer “stunts” or play elaborate practical jokes.205[notes.xhtml#f2t205]The Ascendant (or the rising sign) in one's astrological natal chart is secondonly to the Sun sign in importance. Among other things, it represents thenative's personality and how they appear to others in the world. Crowley'sAscendant was 3° Leo; consequently, he identified strongly with Leo and with thePrince of Wands, who rules 20° Cancer to 20° Leo.This card is Crowley's idealized image of himself. First of all, we find hispersonal seal, the Mark of the Beast, emblazoned upon the breast of the Prince.This device appears in only two other places in the Thoth Tarot—on the Five ofWands (which represents 0° to 10° Leo), and the Ace of Disks, which, bytradition, is the signature card of the deck's creator. The Prince is evenseated in Crowley's favorite yogic posture, the Thunderbolt asana.206[notes.xhtml#f2t206] Crowley, because he felt he knew himself so well, has agreat deal to say about the moral qualities and intellectual paradoxes of thiscard:He is often violent, especially in the expression of an opinion, but he does notnecessarily hold the opinion about which he is so emphatic…. His character isintensely noble and generous. He may be an extravagant boaster, while slylylaughing both at the object of his boast and at himself for making it…. Hiscourage is fanatically strong, and his endurance indefatigable. He is alwaysfighting against odds, and always wins in the long—the very long—run.207[notes.xhtml#f2t207]While Crowley identifies with this card because of his rising sign, it alsodescribes a few other notables whose Sun sign makes them Princes of Wands:Julius Caesar, John Dee, Nelson Mandela, Mick Jagger, Jacqueline Kennedy, MadamBlavatsky, and Christopher Hyatt.Fiery reds, yellows, and gold dominate this card, as they do all the Wand courtcards.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------PRINCESS OF WANDS EARTH OF FIRETogether with the Ace of Wands, rules the Cancer/Leo/Virgo celestial quadrantabove the North Pole and the area of Asia.Original Titles: The Princess of the Shining Flame; The Rose of the Palace ofFire; Princess and Empress of the Salamanders.

The princess is behaving most queer! She won't have any nicetidy lines & I really don't know if she will be alright. She is certainly norelation of the first sample submitted. I think when I have smacked her, I shallhave to post her to you, & you can tear her up or retain her as she strikes you.Oh dear I am tired. I have battled with her blaring wriggles till the eye fallsout & she has burnt my throat & I can't swallow. 208 [notes.xhtml#f2t208]—Harris to Crowley, date uncertain.The Princesses share a special status among the court cards, and Harris seems tohave given all four of them the special attention they deserve. They are allbreathtakingly beautiful. Placed side by side, they are the four pin-up girls ofthe Thoth Tarot. The Princess of Wands is especially stunning, and is one morereason the Crowley-Harris deck is banned contraband within so many prisons.Crowley wrote, “This card may be said to represent the dance of the virginpriestess of the Lords of Fire.”209 [notes.xhtml#f2t209]As the earth subelement of the suit of fire, she not only officiates before theram's-headed altar as Princess of the flaming sacrifice, but is herself the fuelof the fire. We recognize her in people we meet who are so energeticallyself-assured, so independent and irrationally audacious that, whileinspirational and thrilling, they can be downright dangerous to be around.When ill-dignified, she is the ultimate drama queen, who is so shallow andself-absorbed that it never occurs to her that nobody is sympathizing with her.Ifleftunchecked, the Princess of Wands gone bad will not only incinerate herselfneedlessly, in doing so she will also set fire to the whole neighborhood. Shecan be “cruel, unreliable, faithless and domineering.”210 [notes.xhtml#f2t210]Know anyone like that?Princesses do not rule degrees of the zodiacal year, so we have no examples ofcelebrated personalities who are/were Princesses of Wands.Fiery reds, yellows, and gold dominate this card, as they do all the Wand courtcards.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------KNIGHT OF CUPS FIRE OF WATER20° Aquarius to 20° PiscesFebruary 9 to March 10Rules 7 of Swords; 8 of Cups; 9 of CupsOriginal Titles: Lord of the Waves and the Waters; The King of the Hosts of theSea; King of Nymphs or Undines.Crest: Peacock with open wings.Symbols: White horse, crab issuing from cup. Sea.Hair: Fair.Eyes: Blue.images [images/182.jpg]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Swiftness and violence ill suit a character naturally placid; it is rare indeedto meet a person who has succeeded in harmonizing these conflicting elements.211[notes.xhtml#f2t211]I've gotto be careful with this one. Both mywife and son are the Knights ofCups. Of course, none of the negative qualities of this card pertain to eitherof them.Leaping out of the card in the opposite direction than that of the Knight ofWands, the Knight of Cups is a cool contrast to his brother. Fire of waterbrings to mind water in action—a pelting rain, a gushing spring—and the morepatient actions whereby water erodes and dissolves things.Like most of the court cards, Harris's version respectfully contains all themajor features of the Golden Dawn model, including a most beautiful and subtlepeacock that seems to be fashioned from a plume of pure water created by thewake of the Knight's movement.I think Crowley rather liked this fellow, and after all, what's not to like? “Heis amiable in a passive way. He is quick to respond to attraction, and easilybecomes enthusiastic under such stimulus; but he is not very enduring.”212[notes.xhtml#f2t212]We can probably blame the influence of mutable Pisces for throwing her wetblanket on the white horse of our otherwise fiery lord of the waves and thewaters. This makes the Knight of Cups a pretty nice guy. He's just not verydeep. In fact, the worst name we can call him is “shallow water.” He has anatural innocence and purity that make him likeable, but he's often just notdeep enough for those virtues to easily manifest as profound nobility ofcharacter. As Crowley says, “His name is writ in water.”213 [notes.xhtml#f2t213]While this may be somewhat true for natives such as Sonny Bono, Mia Farrow, andBurt Reynolds, there must also be something in the character of this card thatengenders the likes of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Susan B.

As a matter of fact, if you were to trim the borders of the two cardsand place the Queen of Cups upside down above the High Priestess, you would seethat they match in a dizzying display of synthetic projective geometry. Bothcards present the image of a great cup, the stem of which is formed by the bodyof a goddesss. Atu II is the cup of the virginal goddess of the Moon; the Queenof Cups is that of the great mother goddess.Water of water is tantamount to saying reflection of reflection, or mirror tomirror. The Queen of Cups is popular and makes friends easily because, whenothers look at her, they see only themselves. Crowleys tells us that “She is theperfect agent and patient, able to receive and transmit everything withoutherself being affected thereby.”216 [notes.xhtml#f2t216] To liberals, she lookslike a liberal; to conservatives, she looks like a conservative, when in truthshe may be neither. If ill dignified, she can be dangerous and cruel, distortingthe reflections she casts back on her unsuspecting victims, who then see onlymonsters in the mirror.My fellow Queens of Cups include Paul McCartney, Jacques Cousteau, John D.Rockefeller, Nikola Tesla, George Orwell, and Gerald Gardner.Cool blues and blue-greens dominate this card, as they do the other Cups courtcards.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------PRINCE OF CUPS AIR OF WATER20° Libra to 20° ScorpioOctober 13 to November 12Rules 4 of Swords; 5 of Cups; 6 of CupsOriginal Titles: The Prince of the Chariot of the Waters: Prince and Emperor ofthe Nymphs or Undines.Crest: Eagle.Symbols: Scorpion, eagle-serpent issuing from lake.Hair: Brown.Eyes: Grey or Brown.images [images/186.jpg]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The moral characteristics of the person pictured in this card are subtlety,secret violence, and craft. He is intensely secret, an artist in all his ways….He is in fact perfectly ruthless.217 [notes.xhtml#f2t217]With style worthy of a comic book cover, Harris's Prince of Cups makes aspectacular entrance by bursting straight at us from a crashing wave, hischariot drawn by an enormous black eagle. His left hand grasps a cup out ofwhich rises a coiled a snake. In his right hand, he holds an enormous lotusblossom.I have to believe that Crowley had an unpleasant experience with a Prince ofCups. If everyone born between October 13 and November 12 manifested all thedark and chilling qualities Crowley ascribes to this card, then 1/12 of thepopulation of the planet would be melodrama villains. While that may have beentrue of Princes of Cups Lee Harvey Oswald and Leon Trotsky, there is still greatstrength and potential in this card.Libra passing over to Scorpio is a very strong moment, but the activecharacteristics of air in the passive environment of water makes an uneasycombination. Like foaming bubbles exploding from an underchilled bottle ofchampagne, these two elements do not care if they ruin the party or thefurniture; they just want to get out and away from each other. Maybe that is whyCrowley describes the Prince of Cups as “completely without conscience in theordinary sense of the word, and is therefore usually distrusted by hisneighbors.”218 [notes.xhtml#f2t218]I've known several Princes of Cups, including my father, and I must say theywere indeed men of immense abilities who could not be, as Crowley noted, “reliedupon to work in harness.”219 [notes.xhtml#f2t219] The same could be said offellow Princes Martin Luther, Oscar Wilde, Friedrich Nietzsche, Timothy Leary,and Pablo Picasso.Cool blues and blue-greens dominate this card, as they do the other Cups courtcards.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------PRINCESS OF CUPS EARTH OF WATERTogether with the Ace of Cups, rules the Libra/Scorpio/Sagittarius celestialquadrant above the North Pole, and the area of the Pacific.Original Titles: The Princess of the Waters; Lotus of the Palace of the Floods;Princess and Empress of the Nymphs or Undines. Throne of the Ace of Cups.Crest: Swan.Symbols: Dolphin, Lotus. Sea with spray, turtle from cup.Hair: Brown.Eyes: Blue or Brown.images [images/188.jpg]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The character of the Princess is infinitely gracious. All sweetness, allvoluptuousness, gentleness, kindness and tenderness are in her character. Shelives in the world of Romance, in the perpetual dream of rapture.220[notes.xhtml#f2t220]I cannot overemphasize the importance of the relationship between the ace ofeach suit and its Princess. The ace may be beautiful to look at, but, because itis the root—the hidden germ—of its suit and element, it is impossible tounderstand. The Princess, on the other hand, represents the end product, thecrystallization and materialization of what was purely potential in the ace. Inthe language of religion, the ace may be worshipped, but the Princess can beadored. That being so, it would not be inappropriate for the herald of this cardto cry out, “All fall down before Princess of the Waters; Lotus of the Palace ofthe Floods; Throne of the Holy Grail!” You my think I'm laying it on a bit thickfor this young lady, but I assure you, not half as thick as Mr. Crowley did.She's not all dreams, either. As earth of water, she literally can groundvaporous and romantic ideas into manifestation, and provide a fixed and fertilemedium where the water-nourished life of ideas can flourish.Harris's image is one of graceful, fluid movement. The water is alive with largesmooth waves that suggest the heavy environment of ocean's depth. The Princessis dancing, her eyes closed, her head thrown back, an expression of pure raptureon her face reminiscent of Bernini's The Ecstasy of Saint Theresa. The scallopsof her dress are the same motif found on the Ace of Cups, and the hem is adornedwith clear water crystals.Princesses do not rule degrees of the zodiacal year, so we have no examples ofcelebrated personalities who are/were Princesses of Cups.Cool blues and blue-greens dominate this card, as they do the other Cups courtcards.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------KNIGHT OF SWORDS FIRE OF AIR20° Taurus to 20° GeminiMay 11 to June 10Rules 7 of Disks; 8 of Swords; 9 of SwordsOriginal Titles: The Lord of the Winds and Breezes; King of the Spirits of Air;King of the Sylphs and Sylphides.Crest: Winged Hexagram.Symbols: Winged brown horse, driving clouds, drawn brown sword.Hair: Dark Brown.Eyes: Dark.images [images/190.jpg]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I have done as you suggested to the Swords. Thank you Mr Crowley. You were quiteright.221 [notes.xhtml#f2t221]—Harris to Crowley, date uncertain.Swords are the suit of air and, as we begin our examination of these cards, Imust point out a design motif that appears repeatedly in all the cards of thissuit—wings. Lady Harris incorporates angular and highly stylized wingseverywhere! They may not always look like wings, but that is what they are.Beginning with the Knight of Swords, we see that what appear at first to be fourpropeller blades spinning atop his pointed helmet are actually four triangularwings sprouting from his back. They are transparent and veined, like those of adragonfly. Perhaps there are only two wings that are moving so fast they appearas four. Please take a moment and look at the Queen, Prince, and Princess ofSwords, and locate the marvelous angular wings on these figures. Now look at allthe small cards of the suit and see the backgrounds festooned with thesestylized wings—some balanced, almost pinwheel in form; some twisted, broken,stretched, and distorted.It has been suggested that these figures represent magical sigils drawn fromplanetary kameas, or magical squares. Anyone familiar with the extent (or shouldI say the limits) of Lady Harris's magical education at the time would not evensuggest such a thing.The Knight of Swords is fire of air, suggestive of a violent wind. The generaldivinatory meaning of the card can be summed up in one word—attack. “The moralqualities of person thus indicated,” Crowleywarned, “are activity and skill,subtlety and cleverness. He is fierce, delicate and courageous but altogetherthe prey of his idea, which comes to him as an inspiration withoutreflection.”222 [notes.xhtml#f2t222]Famous Knights of Swords include Baron Münchhausen, Arthur Conan Doyle, PopeJohn Paul II, Malcolm X, Queen Victoria, John Wayne, John F. Kennedy, MarilynMonroe, and Cher.Sky blues, yellows, and white cirrus clouds dominate this card, as they do theQueen of Swords.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------QUEEN OF SWORDS WATER OF AIR20° Virgo to 20° LibraSeptember 12 to October 12Rules 10 of Disks; 2 of Swords; 3 of SwordsOriginal Titles: The Queen of the Thrones of Air; Queen of the Sylphs andSylphides.Crest: Winged child's head.Symbols: Head of man severed. Cumulous clouds. Drawn sword.Hair: Grey.Eyes: Light Brown.images [images/192.jpg]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The person symbolized by this card should be intensely perceptive, a keenobserver, a subtle interpreter, and intense individualist, swift and accurate atrecording ideas; in action confident, in spirit gracious and just.223[notes.xhtml#f2t223]This card represents Crowley's Sun sign and so, naturally, it is the mostintimidating card in the deck. One look at this lady tells us she meansbusiness. Water of air is suggestive of clouds that promise either life-givingrain or the threat of a torrential cloudburst. She holds the severed head of abearded man in her left hand and the sword that probably did the job in herright. One may think this grisly touch is just another gruesome Crowleyism. Itis not. This image is the classic Golden Dawn description of the Queen ofSwords, and makes a fundamental Qabalistic statement.The suit of Swords represents Yetzirah, the formative world—the mind's eye ofdeity. Swords' and Yetzirah's counterpart in the human soul is the Ruach, theintellect, which is centered in the brain—the human head. Using the sword ofdiscretion and reason, the Queen has separated the higher faculties of theintellect from the influences of the lower nature (the Nephesh, the animalsoul). She is quite literally, Crowley points out, the “Liberator of theMind.”224 [notes.xhtml#f2t224] The head is that of a bearded man (the Hermit ofVirgo perhaps?), the eyes closed peacefully, the face suggesting the trance ofdeep meditation.The influence of Virgo moving into Libra gives the Queen of Swords thepracticality and grace of a great monarch. This native “should be intenselyperceptive, a keen observer, a subtle interpreter, an intense individualist,swift and accurate at recording ideas; in action confident, in spirit graciousand just. Her movements will be graceful, and her ability in dancing andbalancing exceptional.”225 [notes.xhtml#f2t225] If ill-dignified, she can be ascruel and dangerous as she looks.Crowley's fellow Queens of Swords include Mahatma Gandhi, Eleanor Roosevelt, H.G. Wells, and Stephen King.Sky blues, yellows, and white cumulus clouds dominate this card.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------PRINCE OF SWORDS AIR OF AIR20° Capricorn to 20° AquariusJanuary 10 to February 8Rules 4 of Disks; 5 of Swords; 6 of SwordsOriginal Titles: The Prince of the Chariot of the Winds; Prince and Emperor ofSylphs and Sylphides.Crest: Winged angel's head.Symbols: Arch Fairies winged. Dark clouds, nimbi, drawn swords.Hair: Grey.Eyes: Dark.images [images/194.jpg]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------It is easy to be deceived by such people; for the manifestation itself hasenormous potency: it is as if an imbecile offered one the dialogues of Plato.They may in this way acquire a great reputation both for depth and breadth ofmind.226 [notes.xhtml#f2t226]An earlier version of this card paints a kinder, gentler picture of the Princeof Swords and the arch fairies who draw his chariot. The final version is fullof mad, seemingly futile movement. The geometrical wings of the Prince and thechildren are enclosed in bright yellow bubbles—air of air. The children pull thechariot “irresponsibly in any direction that takes their fancy; they are notreined, but perfectly capricious. The chariot consequently is easy enough tomove, but quite unable to progress in any definite direction except by accident.This is a perfect picture of the Mind.”227 [notes.xhtml#f2t227]Like a madman whose brain creates only to destroy, we see the Prince with thesword in his right hand, with which he creates ideas and images, and the sicklein his left hand, with which he immediately cuts them down. This sounds likemadness, but we are doing the same thing every moment of our waking lives. Whenthe mind is given a creative outlet for this process, such as music, literature,or film making, we discover great genius. Mozart and Mendelssohn were Princes ofSwords, as were the great film directors D. W. Griffith and Federico Fellini,and the visionary Emmanuel Swedenborg.Crowley heaps great praise upon the pure intelligence of the Prince of Swords,but he cannot avoid discussing the futility of thinking about thinking. “He isfull of ideas and designs which tumble over each other,” he points out. “He is amass of fine ideal unrelated to practical effort.”228 [notes.xhtml#f2t228]The great actor James Dean was a Prince of Swords, and while Jim Stark (thecharacter he played so brilliantly in the film Rebel without a Cause) wasfictitious, Dean nonetheless gave profound life to that role. In my mind, it wasthe perfect tortured portrayal of the frustrations inherent in this card—aperformance that I believe, in all likelihood, would have been appreciated byfellow Prince of Swords, Edgar Allan Poe.Clouds of sharp white ice crystals, yellows, and metallic greens dominate thiscard.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------PRINCESS OF SWORDS EARTH OF AIRTogether with the Ace of Swords, rules the Capricorn/Aquarius/Pisces celestialquadrant above the North Pole, and the area of Americas.Original Titles: The Princess of the Rushing Winds; The Lotus of the Palace ofAir; Princess and Empress of the Sylphs and Sylphides. Throne of the Ace ofSwords.Crest: Medusa's head.Symbols: Silver altar, smoke. Cirrus clouds. Drawn brown sword.Hair: Light Brown.Eyes: Blue.images [images/196.jpg]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The character of the Princess is stern and revengeful. Her logic is destructive.She is firm and aggressive, with great practical wisdom and subtlety in materialthings. She shews great cleverness and dexterity in the management of practicalaffairs, especially where they are of a controversial nature. She is very adroitin the settlement of controversies.229 [notes.xhtml#f2t229]Rising out of a cloud of dust, Crowley's paradoxical Princess of Swords, earthof air, appears like a beautiful avenging angel. Her head is crowned with theMedusa-headed helmet, which mercifuly is turned away from our view. For if wewere to gaze upon its awful face, we would surely be turned to stone. Turningthings to stone (“fixation of the volatile”—“materialization of ldea”230[notes.xhtml#f2t230]) is just part of the job description for Princess ofSwords, however.The suit of Swords (as Ruach, the intellect) is a wonderful aspect of our beingbecause, when we identify with the Ruach, we rise above and separate ourselvesfrom our lower nature, the animal soul (the Nephesh). However, when we identifywith the Ruach, we also separate ourselves from the higher parts of our soulsthat represent greater realities and levels of consciousness than our Ruach isincapable of comprehending. Consequently, the Ruach does everything it can tokeep its grasp on our identity. This is why the Eastern mystics warn us that themind is a great enemy. It must be defeated in battle. When the battle begins,the Ruach naturally sends its finest swordswoman into the field—awarrior-princess who manifests everything that is inherent, yet hidden, in herlord, the ace, a mighty champion of the mind—a Minerva, an Artemis, aValkyrie,—the Princess of Swords.Swirling clouds of gray-black dust and violent windbursts darken the heavens andalmost completely dominate and obscure what once was the yellows and blues ofthis suit.Since Princesses do not rule degrees of the zodiacalyear, we have no examples ofcelebrated personalities who are/were Princesses of Swords.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------KNIGHT OF DISKS FIRE OF EARTH20° Leo to 20° VirgoAugust 12 to September 11Rules 7 of Wands; 8 of Disks; 9 of DisksOriginal Titles: The Lord of the Wide and Fertile Land; The King of the Spiritsof Earth; King of the Gnomes.Crest: Winged stag's head.Symbols: Light brown horse.

Most difficult to manage.231 [notes.xhtml#f2t231]—Harris to Crowley, November 3,1939.The Knight of Disks is unique among his brother Knights. He appears to be theshortest in stature. He rides a workhorse that seems to be more concerned witheyeing the lush grass than with conveying his rider. His helmet is completelyraised, and he gazes at the fertile fields and hills, as if in contemplation ofharvest, not battle. His flail dangles near the grasses, suggesting thethrashing of wheat rather than the thrashing of heads, and his shield is a diskthat could double as a dish that could hold enough food to feed a village. Am Imaking this up just because I'm hungry and dinner is late? Not at all. Crowleywrites that the function of the Knight of Disks “is entirely confined to theproduction of food.”232 [notes.xhtml#f2t232]I am sure there are many geniuses and intellectually brilliant individuals whosebirthdays fall between August 12 to September 11 (Napoleon Bonaparte, CardinalRichelieu, Louis the XIV, Bill Clinton, Madonna, and H. P. Lovecraft to name afew). Nonetheless, the natural character of this card is not that of a rocketscientist. The Knight of Disks keeps his nose to the grindstone, and takeslittle interest in (and has little respect for) intellectual musings or thefiner aspects of culture or civilization. If ill-aspected, he will even makeignorance a virtue and take obstinate pride in his own lack of sophisticationand subtlety.Davey Crockett, Annie Oakley, and Country and Western stars Buck Owens, PorterWagoner, Patsy Cline, and Jim Reeves were all Knights of Disks.Rich browns, greens, and golden yeUow dominate this card.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------QUEEN OF DISKS WATER OF EARTH20° Sagittarius to 20° CapricornDecember 13 to January 9Rules 10 of Wands; 2 of Disks; 3 of DisksOriginal Titles: The Queen of the Thrones of Earth; Queen of the Gnomes.Crest: Winged goat's head.Symbols: Barren land.

Theyare ambitious, but only in useful directions.233 [notes.xhtml#f2t233]Life-giving water to a thirsty Earth. What a beautiful concept. What a beautifultarot card. Her dress alone is worth looking at with a magnifying glass.The genteel author, Jane Austen, is an ideal model for Crowley'scharacterization of this card, and matches his description in The Book of Thothperfectly. She was quietly passive—but passivity, Crowley claims, “in itshighest aspect.”234 [notes.xhtml#f2t234] She and many of her characters were“quiet, hard-working, practical, sensible, domesticated.”235[notes.xhtml#f2t235]Like Austen herself, however, there is much more to the Queen of Disks thanneedlepoint and country dances. I believe, at least on one level, AleisterCrowley was having us on when he wrote, “They are not intellectual, and notparticularly intelligent; but instinct and intuition are more than adequate fortheir needs.”236 [notes.xhtml#f2t236] I think he was getting closer to the truthwhen he wrote, “She thus represents the ambition of matter to take part in thegreat work of Creation.”237 [notes.xhtml#f2t237]Think about that for a moment. That is a force to be reckoned with.Water of earth manifests in very complex and diverse ways, and these arereflected in the broad spectrum of personalities who can embody the ambition ofmatter to take part in the great work of creation. A Queen of Disks can bestrong and charismatic like her sister Joan of Arc, or just talented andcharismatic like Elvis Presley. She can be ruthless and manipulative likeCatherine of Aragon, Joseph Stalin, Mao Tse-tung, and Richard Nixon; orsensitive and idealistic like Woodrow Wilson, George Washington Carver, or CarlSandburg. She can possess instinctual, intuitive, and superior intelligence likeNostradamus, Johannes Kepler, Isaac Newton, and Stephen Hawking; or she can be agiant of creative force like Ludwig Van Beethoven, J. R. R. Tolkien, or StevenSpielberg.Dark greens and rich browns dominate the foreground of this card.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------PRINCE OF DISKS AIR OF EARTH20° Aries to 20° TaurusApril ll to May 10Rules 4 of Wands; 5 of Disks; 6 of DisksOriginal Titles: The Prince of the Chariot of Earth; Prince and Emperor of theGnomes.Crest: Winged bull's head.Symbols: Flowery land.

He swells& swells &I can't get him in the picture with al the farm produce & bulls yousuggest.238 [notes.xhtml#f2t238]—Harris to Crowley, date uncertain.A devil indeed! But what a devil! I don't think it's a good idea to put too manyPrinces of Disks in the same room. These fellows change the world with their“great energy brought to bear upon the most solid of practical matters.”239[notes.xhtml#f2t239] Consider this short roster of Princes of Disks: MarcusAurelius, William Shakespeare, Catherine the Great, Thomas Jefferson,Robespierre, Ulysses S. Grant, Sigmund Freud, Karl Marx, Nikolai Lenin, AdolfHitler, Emperor Hirohito, Robert Oppenheimer, Harry Truman, Golda Meir, andSaddam Hussein.You and I, however, are more likely to run into what I call the “garden variety”Prince of Disks—and by “garden variety” I mean just that. Harris's Prince isseated in a chariot filled with globular seeds that seem to be ready to burstinto plants at any moment. He is a very cool character. His eyes are closed inmeditation, as if he were mentally directing the brooding fecundity of theentire universe. He is the picture of someone who is in control on the materialplane. He may seem a bit dull and emotionless, but he's not. He's just not asnob, and he doesn't bother with things he considers impractical. He's theultimate handyman. Crowley confirms that assessment, telling us that “He iscompetent, ingenious, thoughtful, cautious, trustworthy, imperturbable; heconstantly seeks new uses for common things.”240 [notes.xhtml#f2t240]This is the darkest card of the suit of Disks, full of rich browns and blacks.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------PRINCESS OF DISKS EARTH OF EARTHTogether with the Ace of Disks, rules the Aries/Taurus/Gemini celestial quadrantabove the North Pole, and the area of Europe and AFrica.Original Titles: The Princess of the Echoing Hills; The Rose of the Palace ofEarth; Princess and Empress of the Gnomes.

I wish she would not insist on beingpregnant. She just will, so now I have let her get on with it. She chatters tome about being mixed up with the Virgin Mary.241 [notes.xhtml#f2t241]—Harris to Crowley, December 11,1942.We do not know for certain which card of the Thoth Tarot Lady Harris paintedlast, but the date of the above note suggests she was working on the Princess ofDisks toward the very end of the project. If she did complete the deck with thiscard, she certainly saved the best for last. For me, the Princess of Disks isthe most beautiful female figure in the entire Thoth Tarot. “She is strong andbeautiful,” Crowley affirms, “with an expression of intense brooding, as ifabout to become aware of secret wonder.”242 [notes.xhtml#f2t242] To beembarrassingly honest, I am most profoundly (and most hopelessly) in love withher. I am not alone in my sloppy adoration of her divine image. Enlargements ofthis card adorn the living-room walls of many of my colleagues, and it is one ofthe most frequently reproduced cards of the deck.I now ask the reader to recall the Qabalistic fairytale we discussed in chapter11 [chap11.xhtml], and the importance of the Princess as carrier of the essenceof the highest high and the lowest low. As earth of earth, she is the lowestcourt card of the lowest suit. She is the ultimate princess. Not only is shepregnant with the highest high/ lowest low (and everything in between) of thesuit of Disks, she is pregnant with the highest high/lowest low (and everythingin between) of all the suits. She is the Malkuth of Malkuths and carries withinher body the potential of all possible possibilities, and the key toperpetuating the life of the universe.As a priestess of Demeter, she arises in her glory from out of the Earth itselfand establishes her altar in the midst of a grove of barren and dying trees thather fertile presence will now restore to green health. Her magic wand is thediamond-tipped rod, symbolic of the essence of Kether, the highest high, andwhose tetrahedral form is the basic structure of all carbon-based life. She iswrapped in an enormous cape of what appears to be animal fur and is crowned withthe head and horns of a ram. Her disk is a giant seed composed of thirty-sixsections, perhaps suggesting the source of the thirty-six small cards of thetarot to follow. The central germ of the seed is the Chinese yin-yang. Darkyellows and browns radiate a warm and almost humid atmosphere for this card.Textured grays combine to make this card almost tactile.All this Qabalistic cosmology and Eleusinian mythology is fine and good, butCrowley told us at the beginning of our discussion of the court cards that“these cards are suitable as being descriptive, in a rough and empiricalfashion, of divers types of men and women.”243 [notes.xhtml#f2t243] In a tarotreading, what kind of person does the Princess of Disks represent? Because herpotential is limitless, Crowley writes that she might have the reputation of“bewildering inconsistency.”244 [notes.xhtml#f2t244] He uses the example of alottery, where it does not matter how many times a particular number has beendrawn in the past, each future draw provides the same odds of it being drawn ornot drawn again. In the old days of male chauvinism, this quality might havebeen summed up in the somewhat sexist term “woman's prerogative.” That mighthave been where Crowley was coming from when he wrote that the Princess of Disksrepresents “Womanhood in its ultimate projection.”245 [notes.xhtml#f2t245]As he concludes his comments on this card in The Book of Thoth, Crowley writesas if he were ending the entire book. In a way, he was, because the Princess ofDisks is, in many ways, the last tarot card. I too would like to end ourdiscussion of the Court cards with his wonderful of benediction:Let every student of this Essay, and of this book of Tahuti, this living Bookthat guides man through all Time, and leads him to Eternity at every page, holdfast this simplest, most far-reaching Doctrine in his heart and mind, inflamingthe inmost of His Being, that he also, having explored each recess of theUniverse, may therein find the Light of Truth, so come to the Knowledge andConversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, and accomplish the Great Work, attainthe Summum Bonum, true Wisdom and perfect Happiness!246 [notes.xhtml#f2t246]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINETEENimages [images/im.jpg]THE SMALL CARDSHang on. It's easier than you think!247 [notes.xhtml#f2t247]Now we turn our attention to the thirty-six small cards. In the ancient decks,these cards were called “pips” and were seldom more complex than simplegeometrical arrangements of Wands, Cups, Swords, or Disks. Sometimes, the numberof the card was printed on one or more corners, much like our modern playingcards. This changed dramatically with the introduction of secret images taughtto initiates of the Golden Dawn, and the published deck suggested by ArthurEdward Waite and executed by Pamela Coleman Smith. Suddenly, the small cards hadimages that evoked feelings and emotions the same way the trumps did.There is a big difference between the Golden Dawn images and those of theWaite/Smith deck. Waite, an influential member of the Golden Dawn, felt bound byhis oaths of secrecy to the order never to reveal the correct and esotericimages and meanings of the tarot. The deck that he and Smith produced wascreated as a vehicle to introduce the mysteries, not to reveal them. Theycertainly succeeded. It is difficult to develop a complex or overly esotericdogma around the deck, and for this I must admit Waite did a good job of notviolating his vows. What I am not sure he foresaw was the fact that, over theyears, the deck would become so wildly popular that its images would engender aperfectly viable self-referential divinatory device of its own. In other words,the Waite/Smith deck may not be the perfect Qabalistic tarot, but it is perfectwhatever it is.RECIPE FOR THE SMALL CARDSThe small cards of the Thoth Tarot take the Golden Dawn model as their basicstandard and, when considering them, we are immediately confronted with thequestion of their titles and meanings. Why is the Two of Cups called Love andthe Seven of Cups called Debauch? Why is the Ten of Wands Oppression and the Tenof Disks Wealth? Why are so many of the Swords horrible cards?The answer is a simple formula containing two Qabalistic and two astrologicalfactors. The formula is:(n of s) + (p in zs) = sc(Number of Suit) + (Planet in Zodiac Sign) = Small Card)In chapter 9 [chap9.xhtml], we learned the basics concerning the ten sephiroth,YHVH, and the four Qabalistic Worlds. Now let's look at the astrologicalfactors.Let's start with the signs of the zodiac and their divisions by quadruplicitiesand triplicities.QUADRUPLICITIES OF THE ZODIACThe twelve signs of the zodiac are categorized, according to element intoquadruplicities (four groups of three signs; see table 9). The four tarot suitsare assigned to each as follows:Wands: Fire signs (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius)Cups: Water signs (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces)Swords: Air signs (Libra, Aquarius, Gemini)Disks: Earth signs (Capricorn, Taurus, Virgo) TRIPLICITIES OF THE ZODIACThe twelve signs of the zodiac are categorized according to modes intotriplicities (three groups of four signs; see table 10). The nine small cards ofeach suit are assigned in groups of three to each as follows:Twos, Threes, Fours: Cardinal signs (Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn)Fives, Sixes, Sevens: Fixed signs (Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius, Taurus)Eights, Nines, Tens: Mutable signs (Sagittarius, Pisces, Gemini, Virgo)When we put the zodiac signs in order, we see the small cards are ordered infour repeating patterns of 2 through 10 (see table 11). Each small cardrepresents one decan (period of 10°) of the zodiac, and approximately ten daysof the year (see table 12).Table 9.

Princesses: Thrones of the Aces and Rulers of Quadrants of Spaceimages [images/209_2.jpg]Now let's turn our attention to the planets.THE PLANETSStarting at 0° Leo, planets are assigned in the following repeating order:SaturnJupiterMarsSolVenusMercuryLunaThis is the descending order of the planetary spheres on the Tree of Life (seeTable 13).248 [notes.xhtml#f2t248]Astrologically speaking, an interesting and symbiotic relationship existsbetween the signs of the zodiac and the planets. First, each planet rules (orbestows its particular nature and character on) one or more signs of the zodiac.(For example; warlike and fiery Mars rules aggressive Aries and passionateScorpio.) Second, there are certain signs of the zodiac that exalt a specificplanet, almost as if it were an honored guest upon whom much attention andpreference is bestowed. (For example: Aries, the ram of spring, exalts the Sunand welcomes its return from winter darkness.)Because of the way the planets are allotted to the signs of the zodiacthroughout the thirty-six small cards, we are bound to have some planets happyin their zodiacal homes and some zodiacal homes happy to host their planets.Conversely, some planets are decidedly unhappy in their zodiacal homes and somezodiacal homes are equally unhappy to host their planets. This astrologicalharmony or disharmony is a major factor in determining the characteristicmeaning of a small card. It is great fun to peruse a good astrology book andmatch the aspects of the individual small cards with the descriptions of thecharacter of people who have the same aspect in their natal charts. A perfectexample is the Seven of Cups, which, in the Thoth Tarot, is called Debauch. Itis Venus in Scorpio. Venus is not well dignified in Scorpio. Astrologer JoanQuiqley wrote of this aspect:Common types with Venus in Scorpio dissipate relentlessly and are frequentlydegenerates or drunks. Most of you overdo when it comes to sex.249[notes.xhtml#f2t249]What a perfect description of a tarot card whose traditional title is “Lord ofIllusionary Success,” and that Crowley simply calls Debauch.GOOD NEWS/BAD NEWSNow we can couple the astrological factors with everything we've learned aboutthe Tree of Life and the four Qabalistic worlds, and begin working out thenature of each small card. Unfortunately, while the formula is very simple, theinterpretation is rather complex. As a matter of fact, it is very much like oneof those jokes that starts out “I've got some good news, and I've got some badnews.”Take the Seven of Disks, Failure, as an example: * The good news is—we have Saturn in Taurus. Saturn is very happy in Taurus. It is one of the most stable match-ups of sign and planet imaginable. * The bad news is that Saturn and Taurus find themselves in the seventh sephira, Netzach, and Netzach holds a horribly imbalanced position on the Tree of Life.On the other hand: * The good news is that Netzach is the sphere of Venus and Venus rules Taurus. * The bad news is that all this is in Assiah, the lowest of the Qabalistic worlds, an environment so earthy that poor Venus is totally dethroned from her accustomed place in heaven. Add to that the fact that this is happening so low on the Tree of Life that the bad news is amplified to such a disastrous level that the good news is just not good enough to make any difference…and so we have FAILURE.Or how about the Nine of Swords, Cruelty? * The good news is that we find ourselves on the very stable ninth sephira, Yesod. * The bad news is that Swords rule the mind and reason. Yesod is so low on the Tree of Life that all that good intellect has degenerated to heartless passion.On the other hand: * The good news is that we have very active Mars in very active Gemini. The bad news is that Mars and Gemini do not agree about how to be active. Mars is focused and directed; he attacks with the forward thrusts of a warrior. Gemini, on the other hand, is scattered and operates best while flitting around. This is very frustrating to Mars, who now, because he is totally unrestrained by intellect and reason, becomes downright mean. Voila! Cruelty!In this chapter, I will talk briefly about each of the thirty-six small cards.As before, I will not hesitate to quote liberally from The Book of Thoth. But,as much as I respect Crowley's genius (and my own twisted insights), I want toencourage you to use the formula (n of s) + (p in zs) = sc to work out your ownnew and more innovative meanings for the small cards yourself. The more youlearn about the Qabalah and astrology, the deeper your understanding of thesecards will become. Go ahead. It's easier than you think.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------TWO OF WANDS DOMINIONimages [images/213.jpg](Mars in Aries)0° to 10° AriesMarch 21 to March 30Original Title: Lord of Dominion.Golden Dawn Model: A hand appears from clouds and grasps two crossed wands.Flames appear where wands meet.King Scale for Chokmah: Pure soft Blue.The Four Scales for Mars: Scarlet; Red; Venetian Red; Bright Red, rayed Azure orEmerald.The Four Scales for Aries: Scarlet; Red; Brilliant Flame; Glowing Red.Formula: 2 (Chokmah) of Wands (Atziluth) + Mars in Aries = DOMINION--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Following the basic Mathers design, the Two of Wands exhibits a textbook use ofthe color scale—the reds of Aries upon an explosive background of martial reds,azure, and emerald. The colors inform us in no uncertain terms that Mars is veryhappy in Aries and that Aries is happy to play host to Mars.Crowley oberves that this strong astrological marriage in Chokmah (where theelements first manifest) makes the Two of Wands “fire in its best and highestform”250 [notes.xhtml#f2t250] and represents what he calls “Will in its mostexalted form…ideal Will, independent of any given object.”251[notes.xhtml#f2t251]The Wands are demon-headed Tibetan Dorjes.”252 [notes.xhtml#f2t252] Like thethunderbolt of Zeus, the Dorje represents the directed power of the gods, andserves as the instrument of divine destruction that must, of necessity, precedethe creative cycle. “The virgin ovum,” Crowley claims, “must be broken in orderto fertilize it.”253 [notes.xhtml#f2t253] The six flames bursting behind theDorjes allude to the Sun,254 [notes.xhtml#f2t254] which is exalted in Aries andvery happy to be there.See chapter 20 [chap20.xhtml] for the general divinatory meanings of this card.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------THREE OF WANDS VIRTUEimages [images/214.jpg](Sol in Aries)10° to 20° AriesMarch 31 to April l0Original Title: Lord of Established Strength.Golden Dawn Model: A hand (as in the Two of Wands) appears from clouds, andgrasps three wands in the center (two crossed, the third upright). Flames appearwhere wands meet.King Scale for Binah: Crimson.The Four Scales for Sol: Orange; Gold Yellow; Rich Amber; Amber, rayed Red.The Four Scales for Aries: Scarlet; Red; Brilliant Flame; Glowing Red.Formula: 3 (Binah) of Wands (Atziluth) + Sol in Aries = VIRTUE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Graphically, this card is one of the simplest in the entire deck, and holdsclosely to the Golden Dawn model. Harris skillfully uses each of the ten colorsof the scales to present three gold-and-amber lotus wands trimmed in scarlet andset upon an orange background of brilliant flames. The effect is one, not onlyof brilliance, but of immense heat. It represents the primal solar energy thatfirst penetrates the soil in spring to awaken seeds that have slumbered allwinter.Along with the aces and twos (the other two cards representing the supernaltriad of the Tree of Life), Crowley holds all the threes in particularveneration. The aces are the unmanifest roots of their element and suit, and thetwos represent the element and suit manifested as ideas. But with the threes,Crowley argues, “The idea has become fertilized; the triangle has beenformulated. In each case, the idea is of a certain stability which can never beupset, but from which a child can issue.”255 [notes.xhtml#f2t255] In tarot, thatchild is the remaining small cards, fours through tens.What a truly noble and well-aspected card this is. The Sun is in Aries, the signof his exaltation, and couldn't be happier. Furthermore, this harmonious andenergetic marriage takes place in the third sephira, Binah, adding sublimeunderstanding to the mix. The great power (and the will to use that power) thatwe saw represented by the Two of Wands has now become fertilized and expressedin terms of character as Virtue.See chapter 20 [chap20.xhtml] for the general divinatory meanings of this card.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------FOUR OF WANDS COMPLETIONimages [images/215.jpg](Venus in Aries)20° to 30° AriesApril 11 to April 20Original Title: The Lord of Perfected Work.Golden Dawn Model: Two hands appear from clouds right and left of the card andclasp in the center with the grip of the First Order. They hold four wands ortorches crossed. Flames appear where wands meet.King Scale for Chesed: Deep Violet.The Four Scales for Venus: Emerald Green; Sky Blue; Early Spring Green; BrightRose or Cerise, rayed Pale Green.The Four Scales for Aries: Scarlet; Red; Brilliant Flame; Glowing Red.Formula: 4 (Chesed) of Wands (Atziluth) + Venus in Aries = COMPLETION--------------------------------------------------------------------------------As we learned in our discussion of Atu X, Fortune, in the fourth sephira,Chesed, the gunas revolve. And so, even though it is a total departure from theGolden Dawn model, Harris creates a rotating wheel by transforming four wandsinto eight spokes of the wheel of Completion. Each wand is balanced andperfectly complemented with a dove of Venus and the ram of Mars-ruled Aries.Venus in Aries, Crowley points out, “indicates that one cannot establish one'swork without tact and gentleness.”256 [notes.xhtml#f2t256] Harris ignores thedeep violet of Chesed and focuses upon the greens and reds of this planet andsign.Chesed is fourth sephira, but it is the first one below the Abyss. Consequently,the fours of the tarot represent the first solid manifestation of their suits.This is the classic characteristic of the Demiurge (Demiourgos)—a god who, as welearned in chapter 8 [chap8.xhtml], is, by all appearances, the first principaland creator of its universe, but who, in reality, is only the fourth principaland completely unaware of the three abstract principals (gods) that preceded it.Zeus, Ammon, Jupiter, Jove, and Jehovah are classic examples of the Demiurge,who thinks he is god, but who is really only the visible manifestation of theinvisible primal forces that created him. Nevertheless, the Demiurge bringsorder and the rule of law to the universe, a characteristic that is shared byall the small-card fours.See chapter 20 [chap20.xhtml] for the general divinatory meanings of this card.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------FIVE OF WANDS STRIFEimages [images/216.jpg](Saturn in Leo)0° to 10° LeoJuly 22 to August 1Original Title: Lord of Strife.Golden Dawn Model: Two hands (one from each side of the card) appear from cloudsand clasp in the center with the grip of the First Order. They hold four wands,crossed two over two. A third hand appears from a cloud at the lower part of thecard, holding an upright wand, which passes between the others. Flames flashwhere wands meet.King Scale for Geburah: Orange.The Four Scales for Saturn: Indigo; Black; Blue-black; Black, rayed Blue.The Four Scales for Leo: Yellow (greenish); Deep Purple; Grey; Reddish Amber.Formula: 5 (Geburah) of Wands (Atziluth) + Saturn in Leo = STRIFE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------In The Book of Thoth, Crowley writes more about the Five of Wands than any othersmall card in this suit. Could it be because this card represents the firstdecan of Leo, which happens to be where we find the Ascendant in Crowley'sastrological natal chart? Crowley identified strongly with Leo. His signatureeven bore the astrological sign of Leo in place of the “A” of Aleister.This is one of only three cards on which Crowley literally left his mark. If welook closely at the orb of the winged solar disk atop the large version of theChief Adept's wand in the center of the card, we find the image of Crowley'spersonal magical device, the Mark of the Beast upon the seven-pointed star ofBabalon. This symbol is the device of the Ace of Disks (by tradition, one of thecards that most often bears the signature of the deck's creator) and the Princeof Wands, who also rules the 30° period in which we find Crowley's Ascendant.Like Crowley himself, this card is a wild mix of profound contradictions: fieryLeo is happy enough in fiery Geburah, and Geburah implies motion and offers anenvironment of strength and activity. Saturn, on the other hand, presents aheavy and constant resistance to all this. This card is a picture of hot,pressurized magma struggling to reach the surface of the volcano, but frustratedby the sheer weight of the mountain itselfSee chapter 20 [chap20.xhtml] for the general divinatory meanings of this card.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------SIX OF WANDS VICTORYimages [images/218.jpg](Jupiter in Leo)10° to 20° LeoAugust 2 to August 11Original Title: Lord of Victory.Golden Dawn Model: Two hands appear from clouds right and left of the card andclasp in the center with the grip of the First Order. They hold six wands,crossed three and three. Flames appear where wands meet.King Scale for Tiphareth: Clear Pink Rose.The Four Scales for Jupiter: Violet; Blue; Rich Purple; Bright Blue, rayedYellow Emerald.The Four Scales for Leo: Yellow (greenish); Deep Purple; Grey; Reddish Amber.Formula: 6 (Tiphareth) of Wands (Atziluth) +Jupiter in Leo = VICTORY--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Six of Wands is called Victory; the Six of Cups is Pleasure; the Six ofSwords is Science; and the Six of Disks is Success. all the sixes are wonderfulcards. What gives? Are the four sixes special? You bet they are!On the Tree of Life, Tiphareth is the direct reflection of Kether. It is the Sonof the Father. It is perfectly balanced, left to right and top to bottom. It isthe heart center of our psychic bodies and the Ruach of our souls. It rules asthe central Sun King, surrounded by the spheres of the planets: Chesed(Jupiter), Geburah (Mars), Netzach (Venus), Hod (Mercury), Yesod (Moon), andeven Binah (Saturn). Consequently, no matter how incompatible the card'splanetary and zodiacal relationship may be, if that card is a six, we are inTiphareth, and if we are in Tiphareth we're looking good.In the case of the Six of Wands, we are doubly blessed with the happy marriageof expansive, boisterous, and generous Jupiter in powerful Sun-ruled Leo. Thisis the recipe for triumphant Victory.This card is a relatively faithful version of the Golden Dawn model. The wandsare a bit more elaborate and represent those used by various GD officers. Thetwo topped with winged solar disks are those of the Chief Adept, the others areclearly Phoenix and Lotus wands.See chapter 20 [chap20.xhtml] for the general divinatory meanings of this card.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------SEVEN OF WANDS VALOURimages [images/219.jpg](Mars in Leo)20° to 30° AriesAugust 12 to August 22Original Title: Lord of Valour.Golden Dawn Model: Two gripped hands holding six wands, three are crossed. Athird hand appears from a cloud at the lower part of the card, holding anupright wand, which passes between the others. Flames flash where wands meet.King Scale for Netzach: Amber.The Four Scales for Mars: Red; Venetian Red; Bright Red, rayed Azure or Emerald.The Four Scales for Leo: Yellow (greenish); Deep Purple; Grey; Reddish Amber.Formula: 7 (Netzach) of Wands (Atziluth) + Mars in Leo = VALOUR--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The background of the Seven of Wands is deep purple, but, other than that, thiscard is a near carbon copy of the Six of Wands. A crude seventh wand, more likea club, overshadows the other six and delivers a sobering message: “The fourSevens are not capable of bringing any comfort; each one represents thedegeneration of the element. Its utmost weakness is exposed in every case.”257[notes.xhtml#f2t257]There is still enough power and energy in the Seven of Wands to slug it out. Butthe situation has degenerated into such a mess that nobody is sure with whom toslug it out! It may be that a blow here or there will find its mark, but, moretimes than not, it's a waste of energy. Crowleys sums it up aphoristically,“Patriotism, so to speak, is not enough.”258 [notes.xhtml#f2t258]Warlike Mars may find a measure of moral support in proud and fiery Leo, butmachismo is a tragic joke this far down the Tree of Life in the weak andunbalanced environment of Netzach (natural home of sensitive, peace-lovingVenus). The high art of battle has been replaced with the chaos of a mindlessmelee. “The army,” Crowley observes, “has been thrown into disorder; if victoryis to be won, it will be by dint of individual valour—a ‘soldiers' battle.”259[notes.xhtml#f2t259]See chapter 20 [chap20.xhtml] for the general divinatory meanings of this card.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------EIGHT OF WANDS SWIFTNESSimages [images/220.jpg](Mercury in Sagittarius)0° to 10° SagittariusNovember 23 to December 2Original Title: Lord of Swiftness.Golden Dawn Model: Four hands (two from each side of the card) appear fromclouds; clasped in two pairs in the center with the grip of the First Order.They hold eight wands, crossed four with four. Flames appear where wands meet.King Scale for Hod: Violet.The Four Scales for Mercury: Yellow; Purple; Grey; Indigo, rayed Violet.The Four Scales for Sagittarius: Blue; Yellow; Green; Dark vivid Blue.Formula: 8 (Hod) of Wands (Atziluth) + Mercury in Sagittarius = SWIFTNESS--------------------------------------------------------------------------------If this card doesn't electrocute you, it may tickle you to death. Harris departsdramatically from the Golden Dawn model, and offers us a portrait of energybecoming matter: “Light-wands turned into electrical rays, sustaining or evenconstituting Matter by their vibrating energy.”260 [notes.xhtml#f2t260] Withoutmentioning Einstein or the formula e=mc2, Crowley goes so far as to state, “Thiscard, therefore, represents energy of high velocity, such as furnishes themaster-key to modem mathematical physics.”261 [notes.xhtml#f2t261]Swiftness is the perfect title for this card, because it represents everythingthat requires speed and a high-frequency level to hold together, whether that bea business endeavor, a romance, or the sum of all the matter in the universe.All this is fine and good, but what does all that mean when this card appears ina tarot reading? Let's look at the formula.Mercury is in Sagittarius, where the element fire has become stabilized, and iseminently comfortable. This partnership is doubly energized by being in Hod, thesphere of Mercury. Even Hod's low and unbalanced position on the Tree of Lifedoes little to diminish the intense activity of this almost overly stimulatedcoupling. This card is like two people who have had too much coffee who stay upall night, talking simultaneously. A lot may be said. A lot may be learned. But,inevitably, they are both going to crash.See chapter 20 [chap20.xhtml] for the general divinatory meanings of this card.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------NINE OF WANDS STRENGTHimages [images/221.jpg](Moon in Sagittarius)10° to 20° SagittariusDecember 3 to December 12Original Title: Lord of Great Strength.Golden Dawn Model: Four hands (two from each side of the card) appear fromclouds; clasped in two pairs in the center with the grip of the First Order.They hold eight wands, crossed four over four. A fifth hand appears from thebottom center of the card holding a ninth wand upright, which crosses the pointof junction with the others. Flames flash where wands meet.King Scale for Yesod: Indigo.The Four Scales for Moon: Blue; Silver; Cold Pale Blue; Silver, rayed Violet.The Four Scales for Sagittarius: Blue; Yellow; Green; Dark vivid Blue.Formula: 9 (Yesod) of Wands (Atziluth) + Moon in Sagittarius = STRENGTH--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Holding very close to the Golden Dawn description and color scales, the Nine ofWands tells its story in almost quiet simplicity. Eight of the wands are arrows,each of which has a crescent Moon as the head and eight Moons for feathers. Thegreat central wand, with the Sun at its top and the Moon at its bottom,represents the path of Sagittarius on the Tree of Life, which joins Tiphareth(Sun) to Yesod (Moon). “Here the Moon,” Crowley writes, “the weakest of theplanets, is in Sagittarius, the most elusive of the Signs; yet it dares callitself Strength”262 [notes.xhtml#f2t262]The source of this confident strength is the card's position in Yesod on theTree of Life. Not only is Yesod the natural sephira of the Moon (making our Moonhere very comfortable—even if it is in Sagittarius), it is also the Foundation,the “seat of the great crystallization of Energy.”263 [notes.xhtml#f2t263] AsCrowley observes, “The Nine represents always the fullest development of theForce in its relation with the Forces above it.”264 [notes.xhtml#f2t264]This card indicates great strength, but its strength lies in its ability tochange perpetually. Crowley gave what is perhaps the simplest meaning of thiscard when he wrote: “Defense, to be effective, must be mobile.”265[notes.xhtml#f2t265]See chapter 20 [chap20.xhtml] for the general divinatory meanings of this card.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------TEN OF WANDS OPPRESSIONimages [images/222.jpg](Saturn in Sagittarius)20° to 30° SagittariusDecember 13 to December 21Original Title: Lord of Oppression.Golden Dawn Model: Four hands (two from each side of the card) appear fromclouds; clasped in two pairs in the center with the grip of the First Order.They hold eight wands, crossed four with four. A fifth hand appears from thebottom center of the card holding a ninth and tenth wand upright, which crossthe point of junction with the others. Flames flash where wands meet.King Scale for Malkuth: Yellow.The Four Scales for Saturn: Indigo; Black; Blue-black; Black, rayed Blue.The Four Scales for Sagittarius: Blue; Yellow; Green; Dark vivid Blue.Formula: 10 (Malkuth) of Wands (Atziluth) + Saturn in Sagittarius = OPPRESSION--------------------------------------------------------------------------------All factors conspire to make this an altogether unpleasant card. Saturn's ironheel brutally pins poor Sagittarius (the lightest and most ethereal of the firesigns) to the floor of inflexible Malkuth. If zodiac signs could dream, the Tenof Wands would be Sagittarius's worst nightmare. Harris basically follows theGolden Dawn model with this card, and is meticulously faithful to the colorscales. That, however, is where the similarities end. Her Ten of Wands is anexplosive and suffocating image of oppression and repression.Crowley writes that Malkuth, “depends from the other nine Sephiroth, but is notdirectly in communication with them. It is become a blind Force; so, the mostviolent form of that particular energy, without any modifying influences.”266[notes.xhtml#f2t266] Blind force, Crowley points out, in the suit of Wands means“Fire in its most destructive aspect.”267 [notes.xhtml#f2t267]Harris ingeniously illustrates this by transforming the two Dorjes (which in theTwo of Wands were the symbols of celestial power) into dark iron prison bars.Crowley describes the card thus:The whole picture suggests oppression and repression. It is a stupid andobstinate cruelty from which there is no escape. It is Will which has notunderstood anything beyond its dull purpose, its “lust of result”, and willdevour itself in the conflagrations it has evoked.”268 [notes.xhtml#f2t268]See chapter 20 [chap20.xhtml] for the general divinatory meanings of this card.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------TWO OF CUPS LOVEimages [images/224.jpg](Venus in Cancer)0° to 10° CancerJune 21 to July 1Original Title: Lord of Love.Golden Dawn Model: From cloud and water at the bottom, a hand appears holding bya single stem two lotuses, one rising vertically from the other. Upon the stembetween the lotuses two dolphins cross. Two fountains of water (silver to theleft, gold to the right) spring from the top lotus and fall upon the dolphinsthen down into two cups, which in turn overflow and flood the bottom of thecard.Queen Scale for Chokmah: Grey.The Four Scales for Venus: Emerald Green; Sky Blue; Early Spring Green; BrightRose or cerise, rayed Pale Green.The Four Scales for Cancer: Amber; Maroon; Rich bright Russet; Dark GreenishBrown.Formula: 2 (Chokmah) of Cups (Briah) + Venus in Cancer = LOVE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Two of Cups is perhaps the most beautiful of the small cards of the ThothTarot. While Harris doesn't completely ignore the color scales, she does giveherself room for innovation. The calm green sea, the rose-colored lotuses, andthe amber dolphins (or are they Koi?) conform nicely, but she breaks rank a bitby giving us a violet sky. The card is magnificently beautiful and a fittingrepresentative of the first manifestation of the element water. It is the energyof water in its best and highest form.Harris shows her appreciation of the card by sharing a perhaps apochryphal eventinvolving the card: “Also [at the exhibition] a little person aged 2, scuttling& crawling, was asked which picture: Straight she went to No. 2 Cups, Love. Ithought she would forget &asked her again 10 minutes later &she toddled off tothe same Picture. “That” she said again.269 [notes.xhtml#f2t269]Because the number two (Chokmah on the Tree of Life) is particularly expressiveof Will, Crowley wrote:This card might really be renamed the Lord of Love under Will for that is itsfull and true meaning. It shows the harmony of the male and the female:interpreted in the largest sense. It is perfect and placid harmony, radiating anintensity of joy and ecstasy.270 [notes.xhtml#f2t270]See chapter 20 [chap20.xhtml] for the general divinatory meanings of this card.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------THREE OF CUPS ABUNDANCEimages [images/226.jpg](Mercury in Cancer)10° to 20° CancerJuly 2 to July 11Original Title: Lord of Abundance.Golden Dawn Model: A hand appears from clouds at the bottom of the card, andgrasps the stems of four lotuses or water lilies. Two flowers rise to the rightand left and overhang two cups. The third and fourth flowers arise between thelower two and overhang and pour water into a single cup at the top of the card.The top cup overflows in two streams that fill and overflow the lower two cups.Queen Scale for Binah: Black.The Four Scales for Mercury: Yellow; Purple; Grey; Indigo, rayed Violet.The Four Scales for Cancer: Amber; Maroon; Rich bright Russet; Dark GreenishBrown.Formula: 3 (Binah) of Cups (Briah) + Mercury in Cancer = ABUNDANCE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The three factors of our formula conspire to create a marriage made in heaven.“Mercury is the Will or Word of the All-Father,” Crowley states. “Here itsinfluence descends upon the most receptive of the Signs.”271[notes.xhtml#f2t271]In an exuberant interpretation of the Golden Dawn model, Harris fills thesurface of the Three of Cups to overflowing. The images crowd to the very edgesof the card. Her choice of colors is drawn directly from the dictated scaleswith one stunning exception—the bright red pomegranate cups. They are elevatedabove a tranquil sea by lotuses and filled with living water by otheroverhanging lotus blossoms. Crowley calls this the card of Demeter andPersephone and “the fulfillment of the Will of Love in abounding joy. It is thespiritual basis of fertility.”272 [notes.xhtml#f2t272]One could not ask for a more perfect picture of sensuous pleasure and plenty.The imagery of the pomegranates, however, carries a subtle warning. Abundancehas its price. Because she swallowed a few seeds of the pomegranate, Persephonewas obliged to spend part of every year in the dark realms of her husband,Pluto, the Lord of the Dead. None of the Gods of Olympus, not even great Zeus,could break the spell. Crowley interprets it thus: “The lesson seems to be thatthe good things of Life, although enjoyed, should be distrusted.”273[notes.xhtml#f2t273]See chapter 20 [chap20.xhtml] for the general divinatory meanings of this card.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------FOUR OF CUPS LUXURYimages [images/228.jpg](Moon in Cancer)20° to 30° CancerJuly 12 to July 21Original Title: Lord of Blended Pleasure.Golden Dawn Model: A hand appears from clouds at the bottom of the card graspingthree stems of a lotus. Two green leaves grow from the right and left stems,forming a cross between four cups arranged as a square. The center stem flowersat the top of the card. Two streams of water flow right and left from theflower, filling the top two cups, which overflow and fill the two lower cups.Queen Scale for Chesed: Blue.The Four Scales for Moon: Blue; Silver; Cold Pale Blue; Silver, rayed Sky Blue.The Four Scales for Cancer: Amber; Maroon; Rich bright Russet; Dark GreenishBrown.Formula: 4 (Chesed) of Cups (Briah) + Moon in Cancer = LUXURY--------------------------------------------------------------------------------This card is really loaded. As a matter of fact, it borders on being too much ofa good thing. Just look at the formula: four is Chesed, the sphere of generous,expansive, and beneficent Jupiter. Jupiter is exalted in Cancer, and Cancer isruled by the Moon. Can the components of one card get any cozier? No, but, inthis case, familiarity is starting to breed contempt and eventually enough willbe enough. When this card appears in a reading, enjoy the moment, but don'texpect it to last forever.The sea that was so still in the Three of Cups is now restless. The Cups havebecome heavy, the bottom two have sunk to the water's surface and are restingprecariously on the lotus stems themselves; the upper two cups have actuallyflattened out the lotus blossoms and are threatening to collapse the entireplant. The source of the water, the single blossom at the top of the card, iswilted and has lost several petals. It gives the appearance that it is about torun out of juice. I believe it is.Like the Demiurge itself, the Four of Cups, in its self-absorbed arrogance,thinks Luxury is the god of the suit of Cups—all the while never dreaming thatit owes its very existence to the sublime true gods of the supernal triad, theAce, Two, and Three of Cups.See chapter 20 [chap20.xhtml] for the general divinatory meanings of this card.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------FIVE OF CUPS DISAPPOINTMENTimages [images/229.jpg](Mars in Scorpio)0° to 10° ScorpioOctober 23 to November 1Original Title: Lord of Loss in Pleasure.Golden Dawn Model: A hand appears from clouds at the bottom of the card holdinglotuses or water lilies. Flowers fall right and left and overhang five cupsarranged as a square with one in the center. The lotus stem ascends between thecups as a fountain. No water comes from the flowers. All the cups are empty.Queen Scale for Geburah: Scarlet Red.The Four Scales for Mars: Scarlet; Red; Venetian Red; Bright Red, rayed Azure orEmerald.The Four Scales for Scorpio: Green Blue; Dull Brown; Very dark Brown; LividIndigo Brown.Formula: 5 (Geburah) of Cups (Briah) + Mars in Scorpio = DISAPPOINTMENT--------------------------------------------------------------------------------With this card, the suit of Cups takes a dramatic and sinister turn. This isvery disappointing, because the Five of Cups had so much going for it.Discarding the configuration of the Golden Dawn model that displays five emptycups arranged as a square with one cup in the center, Crowley has Harris arrangeher cups as an inverted pentagram, symbol (in this place) of the triumph ofmatter over spirit.What is it that turns this card sour? Mars rules Scorpio and is very happy to bethere. Not only that: all this is in Geburah, the hometown, the sphere of Mars.So where's the problem?The problem stems from the fact that Mars is too happy to be here. He getshimself too excited to indulge in foreplay. This makes Scorpio nervous. He endsup prematurely blowing such a fiery blast upon the relationship that it retardswhat might have otherwise been the slow processes of passionate decay thatScorpio uses to devour and liberate her lovers. Who among us cannot understandthis?Water no longer pours into the cups; the lotus blossoms have been completelyblown away by the hot martial wind that has turned the sky red. The sea is now astagnating pool. Now we can see where the earlier small cards in this suit weretaking us. Love leads to Abundance, which (left uncontrolled) leads to Luxury,which (left uncontrolled) leads to decadence, boredom, frustrationand—Disappointment.See chapter 20 [chap20.xhtml] for the general divinatory meanings of this card.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------SIX OF CUPS PLEASUREimages [images/231.jpg](Sol in Scorpio)10° to 20° ScorpioNovember 2 to November 12Original Title: Lord of Pleasure.Golden Dawn Model: A hand appears from clouds at the bottom of the card andholds a group of stems of lotuses or water lilies, from which six flowers bend,one over each cup. Water flows from these flowers into the cups as if from afountain. The cups are not yet fall.Queen Scale for Tiphareth: Yellow (gold).The Four Scales for Sol: Orange; Gold Yellow; Rich Amber; Amber, rayed Red.The Four Scales for Scorpio: Green Blue; Dull Brown; Very dark Brown; Lividindigo Brown.Formula: 6 (Tiphareth) of Cups (Briah) + Sun in Scorpio = PLEASURE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Balance returns to the suit as the Six of Cups, Pleasure, finds a mostdelightful home in Tiphareth, the sphere of the Sun. The Four and Five of Cupsseem like bad dreams (probably brought on by consuming too much rich food andwine), and we now awaken to the giddy realization that we are the card that isthe direct reflection of the Ace of Cups on the Tree of Life. The Sun isoutrageously happy to be in Tiphareth and shines with double warmth andpleasantness on the sensuous and fun-loving side of Scorpio. If this is thefirst card you draw in a tarot reading, you may want to stop right there andquit while you're ahead. This is a terrific card. Crowley agrees:Pleasure, in the title of this card, must be understood in its highest sense: itimplies well-being, harmony of natural forces without effort or strain, ease,satisfaction. Foreign to the idea of the card is the gratification of natural orartificial desires. Yet it does represent emphatically the fulfillment of thesexual Will, as shown by the ruling Sephira, planet, element, and sign.274[notes.xhtml#f2t274]The sea is alive with broad gentle waves, and the lotuses actually dance,leaving stem trails of perfectly symmetrical patterns and arcs. Water is againpouring into the cups from lotus blossoms, but, as yet, the cups are not filled.Four of the cups are tilted and appear ready to fall, but they are pressedsecurely against the stems by the generous water pressure from above.See chapter 20 [chap20.xhtml] for the general divinatory meanings of this card.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------SEVEN OF CUPS DEBAUCHimages [images/233.jpg](Venus in Scorpio)20° to 30° ScorpioNovember 13 to November 22Original Title: Lord of Illusionary Success.Golden Dawn Model: The cups are arranged as two descending triangles above apoint: a hand holds lotus stems, which arise from a central lower cup. The handis above this cup and below the middle one. With the exception of the centrallower cup, each is overhung by a lotus flower, but no water falls from any ofthe flowers. All the cups are empty.Queen Scale for Netzach: Emerald.The Four Scales for Venus: Emerald Green; Sky Blue; Early Spring Green; BrightRose or Cerise, rayed Pale Green.The Four Scales for Scorpio: Green Blue; Dull Brown; Very dark Brown; LividIndigo Brown.Formula: 7 (Netzach) of Cups (Briah) + Venus in Scorpio = DEBAUCH--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Crowley is definitely not a fan of the Seven of Cups:This is one of the worst ideas that one can have; its mode is poison, its goalmadness. It represents the delusion of Delirium Tremens and drug addiction; itrepresents the sinking into the mire of false pleasure. There is somethingalmost suicidal in this card.275 [notes.xhtml#f2t275]Just look at this card—if you can. Yuck! What happened to all that great Cupstuff higher up on the Tree of Life? Doesn't sexy Venus like to show off in sexyScorpio? She does. She likes to show off everywhere! Venus, however, is not welldignified in Scorpio and often embarrasses herself when she visits.You ask, shouldn't she be happy in Netzach, the sphere of Venus? Sure she is!She's so happy she's making herself sick. This is much-too-much of what was oncea good thing and, this low on the tree and this far off balance, there isn't asingle influencing factor left to remind her the party's over.This card seems like the next logical step in the Abundance, Luxury,Disappointment sequence. Three martinis is abundantly enough; four is just theluxury of showing off; five is disappointing because you're not getting high anymore, you're just getting smashed. But after seven—oh dear! The Seven of Cups isa stumbling dash to the lavatory just moments after you thought you were beingirresistible to an attractive stranger.See chapter 20 [chap20.xhtml] for the general divinatory meanings of this card.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------EIGHT OF CUPS INDOLENCEimages [images/235.jpg](Saturn in Pisces)0° to 10° PiscesFebruary 19 to February 28Original Title: Lord of Abandoned Success.Golden Dawn Model: From clouds at the bottom of the card a hand appears, holdingthe stems of lotuses or water lilies. There are only two flowers that bend overand fill to overflowing the two central cups. The overflow pours into (but doesnot fill) the three lowest cups. There are three cups above the two centralcups, which remain empty.Queen Scale for Hod: Orange.The Four Scales for Saturn: Indigo; Black; Blue-black; Black, rayed Blue.The Four Sales for Pisces: Crimson (ultra Violet); Buff, flecked silver White;Light Translucent pinkish Brown; Stone color.Formula: 8 (Hod) of Cups (Briah) + Saturn in Pisces = INDOLENCE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Much to my wife's disappointment (this is her birthday card), Crowley didn'thave much nice to say about the Eight of Cups. In fact, he called it “the GermanMeasles of Christian Mysticism.”276 [notes.xhtml#f2t276] and “the very apex ofunpleasantness.”277 [notes.xhtml#f2t277]Is it any wonder? This card has a bad attitude (Sorry, Dear). Saturn is a heavyand hard-nosed downer and, this far down the Tree of Life, delicate Piscesdoesn't have enough juice left to put up any kind of fight. This card will haveyou “playin' solitaire till dawn, with a deck of 51.”278 [notes.xhtml#f2t278]Crowley's description of this unfortunate blending of forces is priceless:This card represents a party for which all preparations have been made; but thehost has forgotten to invite the guests; or the caterers have not delivered thegood cheer. There is this difference, though, that it is in some way or otherthe host's own fault.279 [notes.xhtml#f2t279]Harris's interpretation of lndolence is perfect—a stagnant pool, droopingblossoms. The top three cups and one at the bottom of the card are empty; thetwo in the center are spilling half their contents back into the sea.See chapter 20 [chap20.xhtml] for the general divinatory meanings of this card.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------NINE OF CUPS HAPPINESSimages [images/237.jpg](Jupiter in Pisces)10° to 20° PiscesMarch 1 to March 10Original Title: Lord of Material Happiness.Golden Dawn Model: A hand appears from clouds at the bottom of the card holdingthe stem of lotuses or water lilies, one flower of which overhangs each of ninecups arranged in three rows of three.Queen Scale for Yesod: Violet.The Four Scales for Jupiter: Violet; blue; rich Purple; Bright Blue, rayedYellow.The Four Sales for Pisces: Crimson (ultra Violet); Buff, flecked silver White;Light Translucent pinkish Brown; Stone color.Formula: 9 (Yesod) of Cups (Briah) +Jupiter in Pisces = HAPPINESS--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Is everybody happy? Yes!See what happens when we return to the stability of the middle pillar? This isone of the best cards in the deck. Pisces, being the mutable sign of water,tends to stabilize the element. She is most welcome in Yesod, the sphere of thewatery Moon. Yesod is also the Foundation, the sephira that stabilizes theentire Tree of Life. This provides a most cozy and satisfying environment forloveable Jupiter to happily enjoy the good life as only Jupiter and his friendscan.Jupiter also has an affinity to water. Chesed, the sphere of Jupiter, Crowleyaffirms, “represents Water in its highest material manifestation.”280[notes.xhtml#f2t280]Everybody is, literally, happy!Harris follows the color scales and pumps up the Golden Dawn model bystraightening her streams of flowing water as if they were spurting from thelotus flowers and gushing under pressure into large-bowled cups. The whole imageis one of voluptuous, surreal Victorian clutter. There is hardly room for her toinclude the symbols of Jupiter and Pisces at the top and bottom of the card.See chapter 20 [chap20.xhtml] for the general divinatory meanings of this card.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------TEN OF CUPS SATIETYimages [images/238.jpg](Mars in Pisces)20° to 30° PiscesMarch 11 to March 20Original Title: Lord of Perfected Happiness.Golden Dawn Model: A hand appears from clouds at the bottom of the card, holdingthe stem of lotus or water lilies whose flowers pour water into all the cups,which al spill over. The top cup is held sideways by another hand, and pourswater into the left-hand upper cup. A single lotus flower rises above the topcup, and is the source of the water that fills it.Queen Scale for Malkuth: Citrine; Olive; Russet; and Black.The Four Scales for Mars: Scarlet; Red; Venetian Red; Bright Red, rayed azure oremerald.The Four Scales for Pisces: Crimson (ultra Violet); Buff, flecked silver White;Light Translucent pinkish Brown; Stone color.Formula: 10 (Malkuth) of Cups (Briah) + Mars in Pisces = SATIETY--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Crowley advised Harris on the composition of this card, writing:The background; it ought to look menacing. There is something very sinisterabout this card. It suggests the morbid hunger which springs from surfeit. Thecraving of a drug addict is the idea. At the same time, of course, it is thisfinal agony of descent into illusion which renders necessary the completion ofthe circle by awakening the Eld of the All-Father.281 [notes.xhtml#f2t281]—Crowley to Harris, December 19, 1939.Had enough? The Ten of Cups could have been filled with the realization of thepotential of the suit of Cups. Instead, it is just filled with the concept offullness. The cups have runneth over and are staining the carpet.282[notes.xhtml#f2t282] Crowley blames this on Mars in Pisces:Mars is the gross, violent and disruptive force which inevitably attacks everysupposed perfection. His energy displays the greatest possible contrast withthat of Pisces, which is both peaceful and spiritualized.283[notes.xhtml#f2t283]This is the end of the line for the suit of water. Harris ignores the GoldenDawn model and coloring guidelines and creates a Tree of Life from ten ratherdisturbed and tipsy cups.See chapter 20 [chap20.xhtml] for the general divinatory meanings of this card.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------TWO OF SWORDS PEACEimages [images/240.jpg](Moon in Libra)0° to 10° LibraSeptember 23 to October 2Original Title: Lord of Peace Restored.Golden Dawn Model: Two hands appear from clouds at the right and left side ofthe card. They hold two swords like the air dagger of a Zelator Adeptus Minor.The swords cross in the center of the card. A red rose with five petals bloomswhere the swords touch. The rose emits white rays.Prince Scale for Chokmah: Blue pearl gray, like mother of pearl.The Four Scales for Moon: Blue; Silver; Cold Pale Blue; Silver, rayed Sky Blue.The Four Scales for Libra: Emerald Green; Blue; Deep Blue-Green; Pale Green.Formula: 2 (Chokmah) of Swords (Yetzirah) + Moon in Libra = PEACE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Harris has not strayed very far from the basic Golden Dawn model in this card.She has replaced the red rose with a deep blue-green blossom (Libra), and sheforms a stylized Greek cross using the geometrical wings we first encountered onthe Princess of Swords. These wings also festoon the backgrounds of the othercards of this suit.Astrologers tell us that people who were born with Moon in Libra criticize andmake judgments from a position of enviable equilibrium. They weigh every problemand proposition with the utmost fairness. This fortunate union of sign andplanet finds a predictably dignified home in Chokmah. The result is one of thefew cards in the suit of Swords that doesn't evoke groans when it appears in atarot reading.That is not to say that it is all goodness and light. We must remember that thenatural vocation of a sword is to fight, to cut, to pierce, to kill. It is aninstrument of action. Just like the mind, just like the Ruach, the intellectualpart of the soul, it is in constant movement.Eastern mystics tell us that the mind is the great enemy. If we are to achieveprofound levels of consciousness, the mind must be overcome. Fearful that itsexistence and control will end, the mind resists these efforts at all costs.This is why so many cards in the suit of Swords seem so frustrated, anxious,nervous, even tortured.In the case of the Two of Swords, Peace, it seems we've dodged a bullet. We mustalways remember, however, that for the sharp and dangerous sword, peace is justan uncharacteristic and temporary interruption from war.See chapter 20 [chap20.xhtml] for the general divinatory meanings of this card.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------THREE OF SWORDS SORROWimages [images/242.jpg](Saturn in Libra)10° to 20° LibraOctober 3 to October 12Original Title: Lord of Sorrow.Golden Dawn Model: Three hands holding three swords appear from clouds at thebottom of the card. The image is that of the Two of Swords, but the right andleft swords are violently parted by a central third sword. The rose is destroyedand its five petals are dispersed into the air. There are no white rays.Prince Scale for Binah: Dark Brown.The Four Scales for Saturn: Indigo; Black; Blue-black; Black, rayed Blue.The Four Scales for Libra: Emerald Green; Blue; Deep Blue-Green; Pale Green.Formula: 3 (Binah) of Swords (Yetzirah) + Saturn in Libra = SORROW--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Harris is strongly affected by the Three of Swords.Please don't frighten me with the Sword suit. I have obeyed in every way. Ican't see how they can be wrong. The 3 was a fair horror & great suffering.284[notes.xhtml#f2t284]—Harris to Crowley, date uncertain.I wrote earlier that, because they reside in the supernal triad above the Abyss,all the aces, twos, and threes are happy. Obviously Sorrow does not sound like ahappy card. It is very difficult for us to understand the nature ofconsciousness above the Abyss, where the actuality of things does not exist. Inthis abstract atmosphere, there are no things or even forms of things—nothingbut pure potential. The “sorrow” of this card is not the same kind of sorrowevoked by, say, the death of a loved one or the loss of a lover. It is aprofound state of consciousness that, from our below-the-abyss point of view, wecan only attempt to describe. Sorrow falls pitifully short of an accuratedescription, but it is probably the best word the English language can offer us.Ignoring for a moment the astrological aspects of the card, let's consider theunique Qabalistic factors that make the Three of Swords happy to be Sorrow. * Swords represent Yetzirah, the formative world—oh, but sorry! There can be no forms in Binah or anywhere above the Abyss. * Swords also represent Ruach, the human intellect—oh, but sorry! Intellect and reason cannot exist above the Abyss in Binah. Without forms or reason, the mind must give way to a consciousness higher thanitself The Three of Swords represents the wondrous trance of sorrow that firstenlightened the Buddha. We should all be so lucky to draw Sorrow from the deck.See chapter 20 [chap20.xhtml] for the general divinatory meanings of this card.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------FOUR OF SWORDS TRUCEimages [images/244.jpg](Jupiter in Libra)20° to 30° LibraOctober 13 to October 22Original Title: Lord of Rest from Strife.Golden Dawn Model: The Four of Swords is exactly like the Two of Swords(including the rose of five petals and the white rays), except the hands thatappear from clouds at the right and left hold two swords each.Prince Scale for Chesed: Deep Purple.The Four Scales for Jupiter: Violet; Blue; rich Purple; Bright Blue, rayedYellow.The Four Scales for Libra: Emerald Green; Blue; Deep Blue-Green; Pale Green.Formula: 4 (Chesed) of Swords (Yetzirah) +Jupiter in Libra = TRUCE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Four of Swords is perhaps the most beautiful of the small-card Swords.Harris executes a textbook use of the color scales and offers us a portrait ofbalance and order. She writes to Crowley: “I think it would be a good plan ifyou could arrange to come here one day next week & see the Swords. I have asuperstitious horror of bringing them all unbalanced to London.285[notes.xhtml#f2t285]Chesed is the sphere of Jupiter and serves as a gracious but authoritative hostto Jupiter in Libra. Equilibrium and justice are definitely key words for thiscard, but Crowley tells us that it also brings with it the “establishment ofdogma, and the law concerning it.”286 [notes.xhtml#f2t286] Swords are weapons,and weapons discharge their design by virtue of the disciplines of war, not ofpeace. The kind of “truce” the Four of Swords monitors is a peace enforced bythe threat of violence, and as such will be short lived.The four swords are arranged as a St. Andrew's cross, suggesting to Crowley“Fixation and rigidity.”287 [notes.xhtml#f2t287] Their points meet at the centerof a large rose of forty-nine petals that Crowley tells us represents “socialharmony.”288 [notes.xhtml#f2t288] It is the concord of conformity andcompromise, however, that characterizes a culture that would rather blindlysurrender to authority than to face the challenges of liberty.See chapter 20 [chap20.xhtml] for the general divinatory meanings of this card.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------FIVE OF SWORDS DEFEATimages [images/245.jpg](Venus in Aquarius)0° to 10° AquariusJanuary 20 to January 29Original Title: Lord of Defeat.Golden Dawn Model: Three hands appear from clouds at the bottom card. The rightand left hands hold two swords each, the center hand one. The image is that ofthe Three of Swords, but, in this case, the two swords to the right and to theleft are violently parted by a central fifth sword. The rose is destroyed andits five petals are dispersed into the air. There are no white rays.Prince Scale for Geburah: Bright Scarlet.The Four Scales for Venus: Emerald Green; Sky Blue; Early Spring Green; BrightRose or Cerise, rayed Pale Green.The Four Scales for Aquarius: Violet; Sky Blue; Bluish Mauve; White, tingedPurple.Formula: 5 (Geburah) of Swords (Yetzirah) + Venus in Aquarius = DEFEAT--------------------------------------------------------------------------------This card presents five unmatched, bent, and damaged swords forming an aversepentagram. This pentagram of Defeat is projected upon a field of Harris'sgeometric and wildly asymmetric wings, some of which form swastikas. As thiscard was painted at the very height of England's struggle with Nazi Germany, itis easy to speculate that Harris was either consciously or unconsciouslyprojecting magical defeat on this hated enemy. Her concern with the design isclear in her words to Crowley: “I only hope the Swords are alright for I can'tdo them again. I have followed your instructions with meticulous care.”289[notes.xhtml#f2t289]Popular opinion holds that the averse pentagram is an evil symbol. The GoldenDawn even cautioned its initiates never to use it magically. Be that as it may,it is the pinnacle of superstition to believe that any symbol, in and of itself,can be either good or evil. The averse pentagram can be used to symbolize aninfinite number of perfectly innocuous concepts. However, in this card it reallydoes mean trouble.Venus rules Aquarius and, for a moment, she is very happy to have him as herdate. After all, they're both pacifists. They are a friendly, mellow, andsentimental couple. Unfortunately, this sensitive pair has shown up at the wrongparty. A terrible fight has broken out in a very rough and well-armed area ofQabalahville—Geburah, the house of Mars, which is located in Yetzirah (the worldof Swords).Naturally, Venus and Aquarius volunteer to be peacemakers, but they are just toonice, too peaceful, too weak to handle themselves in this violent neighborhood.The inevitable result is Defeat. Sorry kids. I hear things are quieter down inTiphareth.See chapter 20 [chap20.xhtml] for the general divinatory meanings of this card.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------SIX OF SWORDS SCIENCEimages [images/247.jpg](Mercury in Aquarius)10° to 20° AquariusJanuary 30 to February 8Original Title: Lord of Earned Success.Golden Dawn Model: Two hands appear from clouds at the right and left side ofthe card. They each hold three swords like the air dagger of a Zelator AdeptusMinor. The swords cross in the center of the card. A red rose with five petalsblooms where the swords touch. The rose emits white rays.Prince Scale for Tiphareth: Rich Salmon.The Four Scales for Mercury: Yellow; Purple; Grey; Indigo, rayed Violet. TheFour Scales for Aquarius: Violet; Sky Blue; Bluish Mauve; White, tingedPurple.Formula: 6 (Tiphareth) of Swords (Yetzirah) + Mercury in Aquarius = SCIENCE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------In chapter 8 [chap8.xhtml], we were introduced to the small Rose Cross at theheart of the Hermetic Rose Cross. I presumptuously labeled it the Rose Cross ofBeing. In the Six of Disks, this figure is found at the very center of the card,and six matched and balanced swords focus their powers of analysis anddiscrimination upon the mysteries of being. This is Science.The conservative beauty of this card announces that the shining balance ofTiphareth brings a much-needed measure of nobility and clear-headedness to thesuit of Swords. The formula that creates the character of this card couldn't bemore auspicious for the suit of Swords. In the human soul, the counterpart ofYetzirah is the Ruach, or the intellect. On the Tree of Life, the center of theRuach radiates from Tiphareth. Finally, an air planet, Mercury, finds itself inthe fixed air sign of Aquarius.Someone with Mercury in Aquarius in his or her natal horoscope is said to have akeen, analytical mind and an extraordinary ability to concentrate. He or she isalso intensely curious and enjoys examining both sides of a question. Soundslike a scientist, doesn't it?See chapter 20 [chap20.xhtml] for the general divinatory meanings of this card.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------SEVEN OF SWORDS FUTILITYimages [images/248.jpg](Moon in Aquarius)20° to 30° AquariusFebruary 9 to February 18Original Title: Lord of Unstable Effort.Golden Dawn Model: Two hands appear from clouds at the right and left side ofthe card. They each hold three swords like the air dagger of a Zelator AdeptusMinor. A third hand holds up a single sword in the center. The points of all theswords touch each other, the central sword not altogether dividing them. Therose of five petals blooms on the blade of the center sword.Prince Scale for Netzach: Bright Yellow Green.The Four Scales for Moon: Blue; Silver; Cold Pale Blue; Silver, rayed Sky Blue.The Four Scales for Aquarius: Violet; Sky Blue; Bluish Mauve; White, tingedPurple.Formula: 7 (Netzach) of Swords (Yetzirah) + Moon in Aquarius = FUTILITY--------------------------------------------------------------------------------For me, the Seven of Swords is often difficult to interpret in a tarot reading.One would think that a Sword card in Netzach would be absolutely awful. Thereare, however, embedded complexities in our formula that relieve this card ofsome of the more tortuous burdens that afflict the other sevens. For example,the very name of the seventh sephira is Victory. This may seem like grasping atstraws, but Swords resonate well to words like victory. The Moon in Aquariusadds elements of change and the possibility of compromise. Crowley observes: “Itis like a rheumatic boxer trying to “come back'' after being out of the ring foryears.”290 [notes.xhtml#f2t290] Nonetheless, it is well to remember that,sometimes, even old boxers get in a lucky punch.Harris chose to illustrate this as a planetary battle: six planets versus theSun. Look closely at the swords. The hilts of the six small swords arrayed in acrescent near the top of the card carry the symbols of (from left to right) theMoon, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Mercury, and Saturn. The large central sword is theSun itself, outnumbered and battle-scarred. The entire arrangement, however, isorderly and restrained, almost suggestive of a moment when a negotiatedsettlement might be arranged.I wouldn't bet on it.See chapter 20 [chap20.xhtml] for the general divinatory meanings of this card.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------EIGHT OF SWORDS INTERFERENCEimages [images/250.jpg](Jupiter in Gemini)0° to 10° GeminiMay 21 to May 31Original Title: Lord of Shortened Force.Golden Dawn Model: Four hands appear from clouds, each holding two swords,points upward; all the points touch near the top of the card. Hands issue, twoat each bottom angle of the card. The rose is reestablished in the center.Prince Scale for Hod: Red-russet.The Four Scales for Jupiter: Violet; Blue; rich Purple; Bright Blue, rayedYellow.The Four Scales for Gemini: Orange; Pale Mauve; New Yellow leather; Reddish Greyinclined to Mauve.Formula: 8 (Hod) of Swords (Yetzirah) + Jupiter in Gemini = INTERFERENCE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Harris out did herself in strict adherence to the color scales in this card. Onewould not expect a marriage of these colors to appear in art prior to thepsychedelic blacklight styles of the 1960s. The blades of the swords seemactually to glow in the dark. As in most of the small cards of this suit, theswords appear upon of field of stylized wings—here looking almost likepinwheels.Actually, this card is not as bad as it looks or its title implies Jupiter inGemini indicates an element of luck in intellectual pursuits. Hod is the sphereof Mercury, who rules Gemini. As it does to the eights of the other suits,however, Hod's imbalanced and lowly position on the Tree of Life throws a wetblanket on what otherwise might have been a fortunate coupling. There is notenough Mercurial energy left to put up much of a fight, and in the suit ofSwords, fighting is what it is all about. Crowley says, “the Will is constantlythwarted by accidental interference.”291 [notes.xhtml#f2t291]The Eight of Swords does not show us much patience or persistence. If itsinfluence is to be overcome, those qualities will need to be developed andintroduced into the equation. Otherwise, everything will most definitely serveto interfere. See chapter 20 [chap20.xhtml] for the general divinatory meaningsof this card.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------NINE OF SWORDS CRUELTYimages [images/251.jpg](Mars in Gemini)10° to 20° GeminiJune 1 to June 10Original Title: Lord of Despair and Cruelty.Golden Dawn Model: From out of clouds on the left and right, four hands appear,each holding two swords nearly upright but with the points falling away fromeach other. From the bottom of the card, a fifth hand appears holding a ninthsword upright in the center, as if it had struck them apart. No rose at all isshown, seemingly having been utterly destroyed.Prince Scale for Yesod: Very dark Purple.The Four Scales for Mars: Scarlet; Red; Venetian Red; Bright Red, rayed Azure orEmerald.The Four Scales for Gemini: Orange; Pale Mauve; New Yellow leather; Reddish Greyinclined to Mauve.Formula: 9 (Yesod) of Swords (Yetzirah) + Mars in Gemini = CRUELTY--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Oh, dear! Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition! If you have a hangover, don'tlook at the Nine of Swords. You won't be ready to deal with this one. Who knowswhat Harris was doing with the colors, but she succeeded in making themperfectly nauseating. As if to underscore the degeneration of the suit, thepinwheel wings are being washed down the wall of the background by what looklike drops of poison. The whole scene induces dizziness. I can almost taste thedrops of rusty blood dripping from the swords.It is kind of a surprise to find this horrible mess in middle-pillar Yesod.After all, the other nines are perfectly lovely fellows. But even the balanceand stability of Yesod can't come to the rescue of all-action Mars—in all-talkGemini—in the lowest burned-out region of Yetzirah, the world of thought. Watchout! It is, Crowley warns, “agony of mind.”292 [notes.xhtml#f2t292]The only outlet for expression for this card is just ugly meanness. There is noteven enough subtlety of mind left, Crowley points out, to take sadistic pleasurefrom its own cruelty: “Consciousness has fallen into a realm unenlightened byreason. This is the world of the unconscious primitive instincts, of thepsychopath, of the fanatic.”293 [notes.xhtml#f2t293]See chapter 20 [chap20.xhtml] for the general divinatory meanings of this card.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------TEN OF SWORDS RUINimages [images/253.jpg](Sol in Gemini)20° to 30° GeminiJune 11 to June 20Original Title: Lord of Ruin.Golden Dawn Model: Four hands holding eight swords, as in the Nine of Swords,the points falling away from each other. Two hands hold two swords crossed inthe center, as though their junction had disunited the others. No rose, flower,or bud is shown.Prince Scale for Malkuth: Citrine; Olive; Russet; and Black; all with Gold,flecked Black.The Four Scales for Sol: Orange; Gold Yellow; Rich Amber; Amber, rayed Red.The Four Scales for Gemini: Orange; Pale Mauve; New Yellow leather; Reddish Greyinclined to Mauve.Formula: 10 (Malkuth) of Swords (Yetzirah) + Sol in Gemini = RUIN--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Can you find ten swords in the Ten of Swords? It's very difficult. Crowley triesto help us:The hilts of the Swords occupy the positions of the Sephiroth, but points One toFive and Seven to Nine touch and shatter the bright central sword (six) whichrepresents the Sun, the Heart, the child of Chokmah and Binah. The tenth swordis also in splinters.”294 [notes.xhtml#f2t294]There are three swords that form the middle pillar, the lowest having a crescentMoon on the handle. The next sword is placed upon the blade of the first and hasan orb as part of its handle. The blade of the second sword is place upon theheart-shaped pommel of the central sword, whose blade is broken into threepieces.It is difficult to put a good spin on this card. Harris herself reports, “I havedone the 10 of Swords & promptly Russia takes up arms.”295 [notes.xhtml#f2t295]Along with the other tens, the Ten of Swords can't degenerate any lower withoutcompletely changing suits. Sol in Mercury-ruled Gemini brings a completeidentification with the mind and the intellect, which, in this card, are in thevery process of being destroyed. “It is the ruin of the Intellect,” Crowleyintones, “and even of all mental and moral qualities.”296 [notes.xhtml#f2t296]Ouch!See chapter 20 [chap20.xhtml] for the general divinatory meanings of this card.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------TWO OF DISKS CHANGEimages [images/255.jpg](Jupiter in Capricorn)0° to 10° CapricornDecember 22 to December 30Original Title: Lord of Harmonious Change.Golden Dawn Model: In the center, a green and gold serpent with its tail in itsmouth forms a figure 8 [chap8.xhtml#fig8]. A hand appears from clouds on theleft side of card and grasps the serpent where the two loops intersect. Withineach loop is a disk, similar to that of the ace. There are no roses in thiscard.images [images/255_1.jpg]Princess Scale for Chokmah: White-flecked red, Blue and Yellow.The Four Scales for Jupiter: Violet; Blue; rich Purple; Bright Blue, rayedyellow.The Four Scales for Capricorn: Indigo; Black; Blue-black; Cold Dark Grey,nearing Black.Formula: 2 (Chokmah) of Disks (Assiah) +Jupiter in Capricorn = CHANGE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Even though Jupiter and Capricorn are not usually happy with each other, thishigh up on the Tree of Life, their differences are more or less forgiven.Crowley calls this card “the picture of the complete manifested Universe, inrespect of its dynamics.”297 [notes.xhtml#f2t297]Like the twos of the other suits, this card, not the ace, represents the firstmanifestation of its element. Disks being earth and, as we recall, earth beingthe throne of spirit, we have in a very real sense completed a great cosmiccircuit. “[H]aving got to the bottom, Crowley explains, “one immediately comesout again at the top. Hence, the card manifests the symbolism of the serpent ofthe endless band.”298 [notes.xhtml#f2t298] Crowley sings in his Liber LXV:Then I beheld myself compassed about with the In finite Circle of Emerald thatencloseth the Universe.299 [notes.xhtml#f2t299]As if to suggest the nuclei of the first dividing cells of what soon be thematerial universe, two yin-yangs whirl in the center of the two coils of theserpent; the top rotates to the left and contains within itself the symbols offire and water; the bottom one rotates to the right and contains within itselfthe symbols of air and earth. Harris tells Crowley that she paid particularattention to the colors:No 2 Disks is on the stocks, is the serpent's eye to be red? It is a bit awkwardas there are several colours introduced in the card which do not belong toJupiter and Capricorn, I mean the 4 elements colours and they make inharmoniouspatches. Did you say anything about jewels on the serpent? I think you will likehim.”300 [notes.xhtml#f2t300]See chapter 20 [chap20.xhtml] for the general divinatory meanings of this card.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------THREE OF DISKS WORKimages [images/257.jpg](Mars in Capricorn)10° to 20° CapricornDecember 31 to January 9Original Title: Lord of Material Works.Golden Dawn Model: From clouds at the bottom of the card, a hand appears holdinga branch of a rose tree. Three disks are arranged as an upright equilateraltriangle. Crowning the top disk are two white rosebuds. The two lower disksappear right and left at the tips of green leaves.images [images/257_1.jpg]Princess Scale for Binah: Grey, flecked Pink.The Four Scales for Mars: Scarlet; Red; Venetian Red; Bright Red, rayed Azure orEmerald.The Four Scales for Capricorn: Indigo; Black; Blue-black; Cold Dark Grey,nearing Black.Formula: 3 (Binah) of Disks (Assiah) + Mars in Capricorn = WORK--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Although in The Book of Thoth Crowley consistently refers to this card as Work,the title that appears on Lady Harris's painting (and consequently the publishededitions of the Thoth Tarot) is Works. In either case, the factors thatdetermine its character (Binah of Assiah, Mars in Capricorn) make this card,among all the abstract supernal triad small cards, the most un-abstract. In avery real way, the Three of Disks is the material heart of the three-strokeengine that drives the universe that we discussed in Atu X. Crowley says it is“the material establishment of the idea of the Universe, the determination ofits basic form.”301 [notes.xhtml#f2t301]The image is an aerial view of a pyramid or tetrahedron firmly fixed on adesolate desert representing the great sea of Binah. The gray sand dunes seem tohave been formed by blasts of energy emanating from the structure, which itselfis supported by three great wheels. Although they are very small and difficultto see, the symbols of the alchemical elements mercury, sulfur, and salt appearin the hubs of the three wheels, suggesting the eternal universe-sustainingcompetition of the three gunas of the Hindu system.302 [notes.xhtml#f2t302]See chapter 20 [chap20.xhtml] for the general divinatory meanings of this card.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------FOUR OF DISKS POWERimages [images/259.jpg](Sol in Capricorn)20° to 30° CapricornJanuary 10 to January 19Original Title: Lord of Earthly Power.Golden Dawn Model: From clouds at the bottom of the card, a hand appears holdinga branch of a rose tree. There are no flowers or buds other than one white rosein the center in full bloom. Disks are arranged as if on the points of a square.images [images/259_1.jpg]Princess Scale for Chesed: Deep Azure, flecked Yellow.The Four Scales for Sol: Orange; Gold Yellow; Rich Amber; Amber, rayed Red.The Four Scales for Capricorn: Indigo; Black; Blue-black; Cold Dark Grey,nearing Black.Formula: 4 (Chesed) of Disks (Assiah) + Sol in Capricorn = POWER--------------------------------------------------------------------------------This card is well named. It is Sol in Capricorn, and to the ancients, thegreatest display of celestial power occurred each year when the Sun enteredCapricorn and conquered death by reversing its southward plunge into darkness.In The Book of Thoth, Crowleys describes how “Chesed shows the establishment ofthe Universe in three dimensions, that is, below the Abyss.”303[notes.xhtml#f2t303] In “The Rite of Saturn,” he calls it “The Fortress that isupon the Frontier of the Abyss.”304 [notes.xhtml#f2t304] This is a perfectdescription of the Four of Disks.To properly view this card, we must imagine ourselves hovering hundreds of feetabove a foursquare walled citadel surrounded by a wide moat. We are approachingfrom the bottom of the card and are not yet above dead center. Four tallwatch-towers crowned with battlements displaying the symbols of the elementsrise from the corners and tower far above the walls. The main entrance to thefortress is seen at the bottom of the card; a fortified bridge crosses the moat.From this angle, we can only see one other entrance, a tiny opening (that doesnot lead to a bridge) in the opposite wall. Similar openings may exist in thewalls on the right and left, but, from our aerial position, it is impossible totell. However, we are tantalized by what appear to be roads leading up to themoat from the three other quarters, possibly an indication of other openings.The imagery of this card certainly leaves us with many mysteries unsolved.See chapter 20 [chap20.xhtml] for the general divinatory meanings of this card.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------FIVE OF DISKS WORRYimages [images/261.jpg](Mercury in Taurus)0° to 10° TaurusApril 21 to April 30Original Title: Lord of Material Trouble.Golden Dawn Model: From clouds at the bottom of the card, a hand appears holdinga branch of a white rose tree. The roses are falling, leaving no buds on thetree. Four disks similar to the ace are arranged in the form of a square with afifth disk in the center.images [images/261_1.jpg]Princess Scale for Geburah: Red, flecked Black.The Four Scales for Mercury: Yellow; Purple; Grey; Indigo, rayed Violet.The Four Scales for Taurus: Red Orange; Deep Indigo; Deep warm Olive; RichBrown.Formula: 5 (Geburah) of Disks (Assiah) + Mercury in Taurus = WORRY--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Despite Mercury's active nature and Taurus's tendency to be a bit sluggish, thisis not an overly difficult match. People with this aspect in their natalhoroscopes are often very patient, practical, and conservative. However, Geburahthrows a disturbing and stressful monkeywrench into the mechanism of thisotherwise stable device. The natural result is worry, the kind of worry that hasyou asking, “Am I being pulled into a predicament I can't get out of? Am I inover my head? Will I be crushed by the blind momentum of this situation?The surface of this card cannot contain the full images of five ponderous gearwheels laid one upon another like the inner workings of a huge and grotesqueclock. What appear as five disks in the center of the card are actually only thehubs of these massive wheels. The five hubs are arranged as an averse pentagram,each containing one of the five Hindu tattva symbols of the elements: redtriangle of fire, silver crescent of water, blue circle of air, yellow square ofearth, and the black egg of spirit. If we look closely, we see that the blackegg of spirit is upon the downward point of the pentagram. It is clear that theFive of Disks is pointing to the more nasty meaning of the averse pentagram,that of the triumph of matter over spirit.305 [notes.xhtml#f2t305]See chapter 20 [chap20.xhtml] for the general divinatory meanings of this card.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------SIX OF DISKS SUCCESSimages [images/263.jpg](Moon in Taurus)10° to 20° TaurusMay 1 to May 10Original Title: Lord of Material Success.Golden Dawn Model: From clouds at the bottom of the card, a hand appears holdinga rose branch with white roses and buds, each of which touches a disk. Disks arearranged in two columns of three each, thus:images [images/263_1.jpg]Princess Scale for Tiphareth: Gold Amber.The Four Scales for Moon: Blue; Silver; Cold Pale Blue; Silver, rayed Sky Blue.The Four Scales for Taurus: Red Orange; Deep Indigo; Deep warm Olive; RichBrown.Formula: 6 (Tiphareth) of Disks (Assiah) + Moon in Taurus = SUCCESS--------------------------------------------------------------------------------All things considered, things don't get any better than this in the suit ofDisks. The Moon is exalted in Taurus and eminently happy to be there. As changeis the Moon's primary characteristic, however, we may not have much time toenjoy our success. On the other hand, Tiphareth, as always, comes to the rescue:It represents consciousness in its most harmonized and balanced form; definitelyin form, not only in idea, as in the case of the number Two. In other words, theSon is an interpretation of the Father in terms of the mind.306[notes.xhtml#f2t306]For this reason, it is interesting to compare this card with the Ace of Disks,because, in a very real sense, the Six of Disks is an interpretation of the Aceof Disks in terms of the mind. In this, the most earthy and material suit, six(Tiphareth) applies its noble and stable influence toward practical ends—it is abrief reward for the tireless (if somewhat mindless) hands-on labor of theentrepreneur.The basic image is that of the hexagram we found on the white section of thelower arm of the Hermetic Rose Cross (see chapter 8 [chap8.xhtml])—the Sunsurrounded by the other six planets of the ancients. Here the Sun of Tipharethis represented by the rose of forty-nine petals crucified upon a cross of fivesquares. This device, long associated with the Sun in magical and Masonicsymbolism, is surrounded by three concentric rings of golden yellow,salmon-pink, and amber, which, in some reproductions, are hard to see.In a tarot reading, this card acts somewhat like a Midas touch—bringing toneighboring cards the prospect of actually manifesting their qualities on thematerial plane.See chapter 20 [chap20.xhtml] for the general divinatory meanings of this card.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------SEVEN OF DISKS FAILUREimages [images/265.jpg](Saturn in Taurus)20° to 30° TaurusMay 11 to May 20Original Title: Lord of Success Unfulfilled.Golden Dawn Model: From clouds at the bottom of the card, a hand appears holdinga rose branch. There are only five buds, which overhang, but do not touch thefive uppermost disks. The disks are arranged thus:images [images/265_1.jpg]Princess Scale for Netzach: Olive, flecked Gold.The Four Scales for Saturn: Indigo; Black; Blue-black; Black, rayed Blue.The Four Scales for Taurus: Red Orange; Deep Indigo; Deep warm Olive; RichBrown.Formula: 7 (Netzach) of Disks (Assiah) + Saturn in Taurus = FAILURE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------This card presents an image of cold, stark beauty. That, I'm afraid, is the bestthing that can be said about it. Try as I may, I can't find one kind word fromCrowley concerning Failure. But honestly, have any of the sevens really thrilledus? We have to hand it to Lady Harris, though. She did a marvelous job ofsetting seven leaden coins (“They suggest bad money,” Crowleys explains.307[notes.xhtml#f2t307]) struck with the symbols of Saturn and Taurus in a world ofdead and blackened vegetation. They form the geomantic figure Rubeus, whichCrowley describes as “the most ugly and menacing of the Sixteen.”308[notes.xhtml#f2t308]One look at our formula tells us we are in for trouble. Netzach, the sphere ofdreamy-eyed prima donna Venus has, as Crowley puts it, “its customary enfeeblingeffect.”309 [notes.xhtml#f2t309] And cold, heavy Saturn, in slow, earthy Taurusadds jack-booted insult to unimaginative injury. Crowley summarizes the darkimagery of the card:There is no effort here; not even dream; the stake has been thrown down, and itis lost. That is all Labour itself is abandoned; everything is sunk in sloth.310[notes.xhtml#f2t310]When the Seven of Disks shows up in a tarot reading, you better hope yourquestion was “What's going to happen to my worst enemy?”See chapter 20 [chap20.xhtml] for the general divinatory meanings of this card.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------EIGHT OF DISKS PRUDENCEimages [images/267.jpg](Sol in Virgo)0° to 10° VirgoAugust 23 to September 1Original Title: Lord of Prudence.Golden Dawn Model: From clouds at the bottom of the card, a hand appearsgrasping a branch of a rose tree with four white roses on it. They touch onlythe four lowermost disks. Leaves touch the four uppermost disks. The disks arearranged thus:images [images/267_1.jpg]Princess Scale for Hod: Yellowish-Brown, flecked White.The Four Scales for Sol: Orange; Gold Yellow; Rich Amber; Amber, rayed Red.The Four Scales for Virgo: Green (yellowish); Slate Grey; Green Grey; Plumcolor.Formula: 8 (Hod) of Disks (Assiah) + Sol in Virgo = PRUDENCE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Why is the Eight of Disks, Prudence, so inoffensive, while the Seven of Disks,Failure, is so perfectly awful? Both cards are low on the Tree of Life, and offthe middle pillar. The formula explains it all.Hod is the sphere of Mercury. Mercury both rules and is exalted in Virgo. Virgois the mutable zodiac sign (and therefore the stabilizing influence) of Earth.Earth is the element of Assiah and the suit of Disks. (Isn't this cozy?) Andfinally, the Sun radiates its life-giving rays upon all this mental (Mercury)fertility (Virgo/earth).Of course, everything isn't perfect. The number eight position is stillunbalanced and weak. There are enough mitigating factors, however, to makeCrowley comment that this card “signifies intelligence lovingly applied tomaterial matters, especially those of the agriculturist, the artificer and theengineer.”311 [notes.xhtml#f2t311]The disks are plum-colored blossoms of a thick-stalked tree firmly planted inthe earth. Like the disks in the Golden Dawn model, they are arranged to suggestthe figure Populus, which is one of two geomantic symbols representing the Moon.In all candor, I am unsure why this is so. Perhaps because of the Moon'sassociation with the planting of crops.This card is well named, for prudence is a passive activity. It is calculating.Plant and wait. Wait and see. Bet—but only if you've fixed the game.See chapter 20 [chap20.xhtml] for the general divinatory meanings of this card.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------NINE OF DISKS GAINimages [images/269.jpg](Venus in Virgo)10° to 20° VirgoSeptember 2 to September 11Original Title: Lord of Material Gain.Golden Dawn Model: From clouds at the bottom of the card, a hand appears holdinga rose branch with nine white roses, each of which touches a disk. The disks arearranged thus:images [images/269_1.jpg]Princess Scale for Yesod: Citrine, flecked azure.The Four Scales for Venus: Emerald Green; Sky Blue; Early Spring Green; BrightRose or Cerise, rayed Pale Green.The Four Scales for Virgo: Green (yellowish); Slate Grey; Green Grey; Plumcolor.Formula: 9 (Yesod) of Disks (Assiah) + Venus in Virgo = GAIN--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Oh, how happy I am to see this card when the question concerns material matters!I don't care how unspiritual it sounds, I love this card! Six small coins,stamped with remarkably detailed and imaginative personifications of theplanets, surround a large unmarked solar orb that is interlaced with twocompanion disks of the same size. Few cards of the Thoth Tarot bear lessresemblance to Crowley's description in The Book of Thoth than this one. I haveto conclude that his words were part of his original instructions to Harris andnot an account of the finished product.Be that as it may, the Nine of Disks is a balanced and beautiful interpretationof what most people on this planet think of as good luck. Crowley even uses thewords “good luck” twice in his comments:This card is ruled by Venus in Virgo. It shows good luck attending materialaffairs, favour and popularity…the mingling of “good luck and goodmanagement.”312 [notes.xhtml#f2t312]Yesod of Assiah is such a low position in the lowest of the four Qabalisticworlds that its lowness is actually an asset. We are talking big-time payoff onthe material plane, and we are blissfully insensitive to concerns and anxietiesthat plagued us throughout the cards of the other suits. “The suit of Disks,”Crowley observes, “is much too dull to care; it reckons up its winnings; it doesnot worry its head about whether anything is won when al is won.”313[notes.xhtml#f2t313]See chapter 20 [chap20.xhtml] for the general divinatory meanings of this card.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------TEN OF DISKS WEALTHimages [images/271.jpg](Mercury in Virgo)20° to 30° VirgoSeptember 12 to September 22Original Title: Lord of Wealth.Golden Dawn Model: From clouds at the bottom of the card, a hand appears holdingthe branch of a rose tree whose roses touch all the disks. No buds, however, areshown. The disks are arranged thus:images [images/271_1.jpg]Princess Scale for Malkuth: Black, rayed with Yellow.The Four Scales for Mercury: Yellow; Purple; Grey; Indigo, rayed Violet.The Four Scales for Virgo: Green (yellowish); Slate Grey; Green Grey; Plumcolor.Formula: 10 (Malkuth) of Disks (Assiah) + Mercury in Virgo = WEALTH--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Ten of Disks represents the climax of the descent of matter and is thesignal for the redintegration by spirit. Crowley calls this card “a hieroglyphof the cycle of regeneration.”314 [notes.xhtml#f2t314] It is, after all, thelast tarot card. It represents the lowest sphere (Malkuth-Earth) of the lowestQabalistic world (Assiah-the material plane). The tens of the other suits havesomewhere to go. They simply cooperate with gravity and degenerate into the nextlower suit. For the Ten of Disks, there is no place to descend, no place togrow, no place to go. The Ten of Disks is forced to do something that no othersmall card is called upon to do. From its position at the bottom of the cosmos,it has somehow to form a link with the secret of creation, then actuallyreincarnate fresh and new at the very top of the tarot cycle.In other words, it must regenerate the world. That's some trick, and it's goingto take the biggest trickster in the universe to help pull it off. But let'sfirst take a look at the card.Lady Harris's interpretation is almost comically poignant: a Tree of Life madeentirely of massive and heavy coins, its Malkuth bulging at the bottom as if theforces and energies of all the tarot cards, all the sephiroth and paths, all theQabalistic worlds have settled into it like the tired sediment of the entireuniverse. For lack of a more gentile allusion, this card is the portrait ofcosmic constipation. A magical laxative will need to be administered to preventthis stagnant wealth of energy, experience, and matter from putrefying andpoisoning the body.Is there a doctor in the house?Yes! The best doctor in the universe—the god of physicians and magicians, thegod who, tradition informs us, invented the tarot—Thoth-Hermes-Mercury!This is perfect! For a job like this, his credentials are amazing. First of all,as Mercury, the Magus, he knows his way around the supernal triad. (Rememberthat the path of Mercury is above the Abyss and joins Kether to Binah.) AsHermes, he descended to the lowest region of the Land of the Dead and returnedto Olympus with Persephone to regenerate the cycle of seasons. If he could dothat, jump-starting the Ten of Disks is going to be a piece of cake! Hisgreatest credential is that he is Thoth—the inventor and sustainer of thisentire tarot universe.315 [notes.xhtml#f2t315]As if to attract Mercury's attention so that he may perform this most necessarymagick, Harris painted this card as a veritable invocation of Material. All thesephiroth but one bear an image or word sacred to Mercury: * Kether—we find the most common symbol of the planet Mercury; * Chokmah—the symbol of Mercury as the Magus (Note that the right-angled positions of the arms are identical to the gesture made by the Magus in Atu I.); * Binah—the symbol of alchemical Mercury; * Chesed—the letter Pa, the Enochian equivalent of the letter “B” (Harris associated this with the Hebrew letter Beth which is assigned to Mercury); * Geburah—the Hebrew letter Beth; * Tiphareth—the name of Raphael (written in Hebrew), the ruling angel of Mercury; * Netzach—the eight-pointed star of Mercury; * Hod—the hexagram within the hexagon, symbol of the Sun (see below); * Yesod—the Pythagorean Tetractys; * Malkuth—the Mercurial caduceus made from the three mother letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Why do all the sephiroth contain an image of Mercury except Hod, the sphere ofMercury itself? That is a very good question. Crowley mentions it as being thekey to this remarkable regenerative process:These disks are inscribed with various symbols of mercurial character, exceptthat the coin in the place of Hod (Mercury) on the Tree is marked with thecipher of the Sun. This indicates the only possibility of issue from the impasseproduced by the exhaustion of all the elemental forces.316 [notes.xhtml#f2t316]I take this to mean that, at this stage of the game, Mercury needs inspirationand direction. Crowley said it most succinctly:When wealth accumulates beyond a certain point, it must either become completelyinert and cease to be wealth, or call in the aid of intelligence to use itrightly.…In this way, Carnegie establishes a Library, Rockefeller endowsResearch, simply because there is nothing else to do.317 [notes.xhtml#f2t317]By plugging in the Sun in the sphere of Mercury, in a Tree of Life otherwiseloaded with Mercury, Harris is calling in the aid of intelligence to give thiscard the spiritual integrity necessary to regenerate the world and become theultimate cosmic philanthropist.See chapter 20 [chap20.xhtml] for the general divinatory meanings of this card.images [images/273.jpg]How I should like to do them all again.318 [notes.xhtml#f2t318]—Harris to Crowley, date uncertain."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTYimages [images/im.jpg]METHOD OF DIVINATION AND THE MEANINGS OF THE CARDSAll divination resembles an attempt by a man born blind to obtain sight bygetting blind drunk.319 [notes.xhtml#f2t319]The cards are not to be sold without the book. If the book can be printedwithout illustrations it need not cost more than £300. If Lady Harris likes, shecan give it away with the cards, I do not want any money out of it: and she cansay she wrote it, I don't care. But I will not allow the cards to be issued sothat they can be used only for gambling or fortune-telling.320[notes.xhtml#f2t320]—Crowley, Legal memorandum regarding “Stipend,” date uncertain.You may think it odd (after I have written so much about things like projectivegeometry, the Golden Dawn, changing Aeons, desert visions, the Hermetic RoseCross, the Tree of Life, color scales, guardian angels, and the magical,alchemical, and Qabalistic intricacies of the Thoth Tarot) that I appear to havesuch precious little to say about the use of the cards in divination. I assureyou this is not because I wish to denigrate the tarot's potential as adivinatory device or discourage its use as such. On the contrary, I use thecards for divination, Crowley used the cards for divination, and many of themost gifted tarot readers in the world use the Thoth Tarot for divination.Throughout this book, I have tried to remain true to the promise of its title. Iknow. I probably slipped in a few places here and there and stuck in a littletoo much DuQuette. But, for the most part, I believe I've been a faithfulCrowley delivery system, and I do not intend to spoil that now by introducingLon Milo DuQuette's subjective thoughts on tarot spreads and the divinatorymeanings of the Thoth Tarot.Any adept reader of tarot cards will tell you that if you wish to use the tarotas a divinatory tool, it is best to choose a spread and to develop a personalglossary of meanings based upon your own familiarity with the qualities andcharacteristics of each card and the knowledge and experience you gather inactually working with the cards.To develop that experience, you need to start somewhere—and for most people thatsomewhere usually entails reading the cards for yourself or others and lookingup the meaning of the cards in a book. If that is what you intend to do withthis book, then I am going to stay completely out of the way. The method ofdivination and meanings you will find in this chapter have been culledexclusively from Crowley's own writings and from the tarot material found in TheEquinox, Volume I.321 [notes.xhtml#f2t321]You will see that Crowley's method of divination is extremely complex andincorporates many of the astrological and Qabalistic principles I've discussedthrough out the book. If you are just beginning your tarot career, you will mostlikely want to start with a simpler method, such as the three-cardPast-Present-Future spread, or others you can find in other tarot texts.A METHOD OF DIVINATION BY THE TAROT O. M. (ALEISTER CROWLEY)322[notes.xhtml#f2t322][This method is that given to students of the grade Adept Adeptus Minor in theR. R. et A. C. But it has been revised and improved, while certain safeguardshave been introduced in order to make its abuse impossible.—O.M.] 1. THE SIGNIFICATOR Choose a card to represent the Querent, using your knowledge or judgment of his character rather than dwelling on his physical characteristics. 2. Take the cards in your left hand. In the right hand hold the wand over them, and say: I invoke thee, I A 0, that thou wilt send H R U, the great Angel that is set over the operations of this Secret Wisdom, to lay his hand invisibly upon these consecrated cards of art, that thereby we may obtain true knowledge of hidden things, to the glory of thine ineffable Name. Amen. 3. Hand the cards to Querent, and bid him think of the question attentively, and cut. 4. Take the cards as cut, and hold as for dealing.First OperationThis shows the situation of the Querent at the time when he consults you. 1. The pack being in front of you, cut, and place the top half to the left. 2. Cut each pack again to the left. 3. These four stacks represent I H V H, from right to left. 4. Find the Significator. If it be in the Yod pack, the question refers to work, business, etc.; if in the Hé pack, to love, marriage, or pleasure; if in the Vau pack, to trouble, loss, scandal, quarrelling, etc.; if in the Hé final pack, to money, goods, and such purely material matters. 5. Tell the Querent what he has come for: if wrong, abandon the divination. 6. If right, spread out the pack containing the Significator, face upwards. Count the cards from him, in the direction in which he faces.323 [notes.xhtml#f2t323] The counting should include the card from which you count. For Knights, Queens and Princes, count 4. For Princesses, count 7. For Aces, count 11. For small cards, count according to the number. For trumps, count 3 for the elemental trumps; 9 for the planetary trumps; 12 for the Zodiacal trumps. Make a “story” of these cards. This story is that of the beginning of the affair. 7. Pair the cards on either side of the Significator, then those outside them, and so on. Make another “story,” which should fill in the details omitted in the first. 8. If this story is not quite accurate, do not be discouraged. Perhaps the Querent himself does not know everything. But the main lines ought to be laid down firmly, with correctness, or the divination should be abandoned. Second OperationDEVELOPMENT OF THE QUESTION 1. Shuffle, invoke suitably, and let Querent cut as before. 2. Deal cards into twelve stacks, for the twelve astrological houses of heaven. 3. Make up your mind in which stack you ought to find the Significator, “e.g.” in the seventh house if the question concerns marriage, and so on. 4. Examine this chosen stack. If the Significator is not there, try some cognate house. On a second failure, abandon the divination. 5. Read the stack counting and pairing as before.Third OperationFURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE QUESTION 1. Shuffle, etc., as before. 2. Deal cards into twelve stacks for the twelve signs of the Zodiac. 3. Divine the proper stack and proceed as before.Fourth OperationPENULTIMATE ASPECTS OF THE QUESTIONS 1. Shuffle, etc., as before. 2. Find the Significator: set him upon the table; let the thirty-six cards following form a ring round him. 3. Count and pair as before.[Note that the nature of each Decan is shewn by the small card attributed to it,and by the symbols given in Liber DCCLXXVII, cols. 149–151.]Fifth OperationFINAL RESULT 1. Shuffle, etc., as before. 2. Deal into ten packs in the form of the Tree of Life. 3. Make up your mind where the Significator should be, as before; but failure does not here necessarily imply that the divination has gone astray. 4. Count and pair as before.[Note that one cannot tell at what part of the divination the present timeoccurs. Usually Op. 1 seems to indicate the past history of the question; butnot always so. Experience will teach. Sometimes a new current of high help mayshow the moment of consultation.I may add that in material matters this method is extremely valuable. I havebeen able to work out the most complex problems in minute detail. O.M.]It is quite impossible to obtain satisfactory results from this or any othersystem of divination unless the Art is perfectly required. It is the mostsensitive, difficult and perilous branch of Magick. The necessary conditions,with a comprehensive comparative review of all important methods in use, arefully described and discussed in “Magick,” Chapter XVII [chap17.xhtml].The abuse of divination has been responsible, more than any other cause, for thediscredit into which the whole subject of Magick had fallen when the MasterTherion undertook the task of its rehabilitation. Those who neglect his warningsand profane the Sanctuary of Transcendental Art have no other than themselves toblame for the formidable and irremediable disasters which infallibly willdestroy them. Prospero is Shakespeare's reply to Dr. Faustus.DIVINATORY MEANINGS OF THE TWENTY-TWO ATUS OF THE MAJOR ARCANA324[notes.xhtml#f2t324]THE FOOLIn spiritual matters, the Fool means idea, thought, spirituality, that whichendeavours to transcend earth. In material matters, it may, if badly dignified,mean folly, eccentricity, or even mania.

In this grade, one attains the knowledge and conversation of the HolyGuardian Angel. Adjustment: Atu VIII of the Thoth Tarot. The traditional name ofthis card is Justice. See Lamed.Aeon: Atu XX of the Thoth Tarot. The traditional name of this card is Judgmentor The Last Judgment. The Aeon represents the birth of the Aeon of Horus, whichsignaled the last judgment (end of the world) of the previous Age, the Aeon ofOsiris. See Aeon of Horus; Aeon of Isis; Aeon of Osiris; Shin; Fire; Spirit.Aeon of Horus: The present magical age of human development. According toCrowley, it began at the Equinox of the Gods, March 20, 1904. Inspired by theknowledge that the Sun is perpetually shining (and not killed and reborn witheach daily and yearly cycle), enlightened worshipers of the Aeon of Horus viewlife as a process of continual growth and strife by which one eventuallydevelops the death-conquering consciousness of the continuity of existence. Inthe Aeon of Horus, it is the individual, not the tribe, family or nation, thatis the basic unit of society.Aeon of Isis: Magical age of human development at which time the pursuit ofbasic nourishment was the dominant theme in human consciousness and endeavor.The Earth and the powers of woman were deified as the source of all life andnourishment. This matriarchal age was characterized by the mysteries of thehunt, goddess worship, and cannibalism.Aeon of Osiris: Magical age of human development at which time the mysteries oflife and death were the dominant theme in human consciousness and endeavor. TheSun and powers of man were deified as the supreme source of all life. Thispatriarchal age was obsessed with overcoming death and was characterized by themysteries of agriculture, human sacrifice, and the worship of male gods who aremurdered and resurrected.Ain—Nothing: Profound negativity, precluding even the concept of negativeexistence. First of the three negative veils from which Kether (One) emerges.See Fool.Ain-Soph—Nothing without Limit: Second of the three negative veils from whichKether (One) emerges.

Hebrew equivalent to English letter A and thenumber 1. On the Tree of Life, it is path 11, joining the first sephira, Kether,with the second sephira, Chokmah. Represents the element air. Tarot trump—theFool.Angel: Traditionally, the man or angel is the Kerubic emblem of Aquarius.However, in the New Aeon (and as represented in the Thoth Tarot), the angel isthe Kerubic emblem of Scorpio. See Kerubic Emblems.Ankh-af-na Khonsu: Twenty-fifth dynasty Egyptian priest of Mentu and politicalfigure. His self-painted funeral stèle was on display at Cairo's Boulak museumin the spring of 1904 and served as the magical talisman that triggered thepsychic events leading up to the Equinox of the Gods and Crowley's reception ofThe Book of the Law.Art: Atu XIV of the Thoth Tarot. The traditional name of this card isTemperance. See Samekh, Sagittarius.Assiah: See Qabalistic Worlds.Astrological Age: By observing the relative position of the Sun against thebackdrop of the zodiacal band at the vernal equinox, ancient observersdiscovered that the Sun seemed to fall a bit short of its starting position ofthe previous year, resulting in the loss of approximately one full degree everyseventy-two years. This makes the Sun appear to move backward across the belt ofthe zodiac at the approximate rate of one zodiac sign every two thousand onehundred sixty years. The ancients called this process the precession of theequinoxes. The time it takes to move from one sign to another is known as anastrological age. This phenomenon is actually caused by an extremely slow wobbleof Earth's axis, which, like a spinning top, traces circles in space with itsnorth and south poles. Astrologers generally agree we have recently entered orare about to enter the astrological Age of Aquarius.Atu: The trumps of the Thoth Tarot are numbered by roman numerals and designatedAtus. “Some Etymologists of a singularly idle disposition have tried to derivethe French word “atout” from the ATU meaning House. It may seem simpler tosuggest that ‘atout’ is short for ‘bon a tout’, meaning ‘good for anything’,because a trump will take any card of any suit.”329 [notes.xhtml#f2t329]Atziluth: See Qabalistic WorldsAyin—images [images/293.jpg]: Eye. Hebrew equivalent to English letters A, Au,or O, and the number seventy. On the Tree of Life, it is path 26, joining thesixth sephira, Tiphareth, with the eighth sephira, Hod. Represents the zodiacsign Capricorn. tarot trump—the Devil.Babalon: In the Thelemic pantheon, Babalon is one of two major aspects of femaledeity, Nuit being the other. Just as Nuit is paired with Hadit, her malecounterpart, Babalon, joins with the Therion, the Beast. The following isexcerpted from The Magick of Thelema.Therion/Babalon as Chokmah/Binah—To the student of the Qabalah the easiest wayto begin to understand Therion and Babalon is to conceptualize them aspersonifications of the second and third Sephiroth of the Tree of Life, Chokmahand Binah, respectively.The second Sephira, Chokmah represents the original concept of duality, and assuch is the chaotic despoiler of the perfect unity of the first Sephira, Kether.Chaos is another title of Chokmah and in certain Thelemic rituals is identifiedwith Therion. Chokmah is also the Divine Will, the Logos, the Word whosevibration is the creative essence of the universe. As the supernal Father,Chokmah/Therion is the archetype of the lingam, the universal Male.The third Sephira, Binah represents the original reconciliation and balance ofthe Divine Self (Kether) and the reflected Not Self (Chokmah). She is viewed asthe all-receptive mate of Chokmah and when they are united the primal unity ofKether is realized. As Binah/Babalon resides just above the Abyss, Sheeventually receives unto Herself the totality of the life of the evolvinguniverse. This universal life is symbolized as the “blood of the Saints” whichShe gathers up into her great cup (the Holy Grail). This she shares with theBeast, and they unite in drunken ecstasy. Thus she is called the Great Whore forin her “shamelessness” she receives all and refuses none.”330[notes.xhtml#f2t330]Beast: In the Thelemic pantheon, the Beast is one of two major aspects of maledeity, Hadit being the other. On the Tree of Life, the Beast is associated withthe second sephira, Chokmah. See Babalon.Beth—images [images/293_1.jpg]: House. Hebrew equivalent to English letter B andthe number two. On the Tree of Life, it is path 12, joining the first sephira,Kether, with the third sephira, Binah. Represents the planet Mercury; Tarottrump—the Magus.Binah—Understanding: The third sephira of the Tree of Life; the sphere ofSaturn. Binah is also sephirotic home to the great mother, Babalon, and Nuit. Intarot, it is the home of the four court-card Queens, and the small-card threes.Blood of the Martyrs (Saints): The consciousness and the essence of all evolvinglife. See the Chariot, Holy Grail, Babalon.The Book of the Law: Liber AL vel Legis, The Book of the Law, was dictated toCrowley on April 8, 9, and 10, 1904, in Cairo by a præter human intelligencecalling itself Aiwass. It is the primary holy book of Thelema and the source ofdoctrines relating to the Thoth Tarot, especially the concept of the Hebrewletter Tzaddi not being attributed to the Star trump.Briah: See Qebalistic Worlds.Bull—Taurus: See Kerubic Emblems.Chariot: Atu VII of the Thoth Tarot. See Cheth.Charioteer: Conveyor of the Holy Grail. Alternate title for Atu VII, theChariot.Chesed—Mercy: The fourth sephira on the Tree of Life; the sphere of Jupiter. Asthe first sephira below the Abyss, Chesed is the highest manifestation of theuniverse in actuality (the supernal triad above it being the inscrutable andunmanifest ideal). Consequently, Chesed is the perfect environment for theDemiurge (Demiourgos), the creator god who, because it seemingly created theuniverse, mistakenly thinks and acts as if it were the supreme being. Because itis not really the supreme being, the Demiurge has a real blind spot concerningits omnipotence, and, like a spoiled child, is constantly trying to prove itsdivinity. This leaves us with a creator who is violently insecure and paranoid.The jealous and psychotic behavior of the mythological composite gods associatedwith Chesed—Zeus/Jupiter/Jove/Jehovah—are frightfully consistent with thissyndrome. In tarot, Chesed is the home of the small-card fours.Cheth—images [images/294.jpg]: Fence. Hebrew equivalent to English letters Chand the number eight. On the Tree of Life, it is path 18, joining the thirdsephira, Binah, with the fifth sephira, Geburah. Represents the zodiac signCancer. Tarot trump—the Chariot.Chiah: See Parts of the Soul.Chokmah—Wisdom: The second sephira of the Tree of Life; the sphere of thezodiac. Chokmah is also sephirotic home to the All-Father, the Beast, and Hadit.In tarot, Chokmah is the home of the four court-card Knights and the small-cardtwos.Choronzon: See Daath.Color Scales: The pure divine consciousness becomes obscured as it descends theten sephiroth of each of the four Qabalistic worlds. The Qabalists imagine thisdescent of spirit into matter as a pure light broken into progressively lowervibrations. The four scales of color are, in descending order: The King, Queen,Prince, and Princess scales. See chapter 10 [chap10.xhtml].Crowley, Edward Alexander (Aleister): 1875-1947. A very interesting andcontroversial person.Crowley, Rose Edith: 1874-1932. Aleister Crowley's first wife. Older sister ofSir Gerald Festus Kelly (1879-1972), later president of the Royal Art Academy inEngland. Rose was very instrumental in the psychic events leading up to andincluding the reception of The Book of the Law. Crowley considered her his firstScarlet Woman (Shakti).Cup: Magical weapon representing the magician's understanding. The cuprepresents the Neshamah (soul intuition) part of the soul, and the Qabalisticworld of Briah (creative world).Cup of Babalon: Binah personified as the vessel that receives the totality ofthe essence of al evolving life (blood of the Saints) and receives the Master ofthe Temple (8° = 3▫) after he or she has crossed the Abyss (the pathless area onthe Tree of Life between the fourth sephira, Chesed, and the third sephira,Binah). See Atu XI, Lust; Atu VII, the Chariot; Atu XII, the Universe; Babalon;Binah; Master of the Temple; Nuit; and Holy Grail.Cup of Fornication: See Holy Grail.Cups: See Suits. In tarot readings, Cups often indicate matters of the heart,romance, love, creativity, art, and emotions.Daath—Knowledge: A phantom or false sephira of the Tree of Life positioned inthe Abyss separating the supernal triad from the rest of the Tree. Whileknowledge is a vital and necessary tool in one's initiatory journey, thereasoning faculties have their limits and must eventually be overcome before thehighest levels of consciousness can be achieved. Daath is the false crown ofreason, and the Abyss is the abode of Choronzon, archdemon of dispersion.

Crowley's visions of the thrity Aethyrs are chronicled in TheVision and The Voice,331 [notes.xhtml#f2t331] and directly influence the imageryfound on several trumps, especially the Magus, the Lovers, the Chariot, Lust,Art, and the Universe.Equinox of the Gods: See Aeon of Horus.Etz Ha-Chayim : See Tree of Life.Fool: Atu 0 of the Thoth Tarot.

Many of the cards of the ThothTarot are based on the Golden Dawn model. Aleister Crowley joined in 1898 andwould later become the catalyst in the events that would bring about the Order'sdestruction. Nevertheless, the basic degree structure of the Golden Dawn wouldserve as the model for Crowley's Order of images [images/ch.jpg].Gunas: “All the qualities that can be predicated of anything may be ascribed toone or more of these Gunas: Tamas is darkness, inertia, sloth, ignorance, deathand the like; Rajas is energy, excitement, fire, brilliance, restlessness;Sattvas is calm, intelligence, lucidity and balance.”332 [notes.xhtml#f2t332]Hadit (alternate spelling “Hadith”): “The Second Deity of the Thelemic Trinity.Lover of Nuit.

Each of these four elementalcategories is in turn divided into three modes (cardinal, fixed, and mutable)that represent three fundamental ways the energy of the element develops andmanifests. The three modes are as follows:Cardinal represents “the first keen onrush of that element.”336[notes.xhtml#f2t336] Cardinal signs burst into their element at the equinoxesand solstices and say, “Here I am!”Fixed signs define and concentrate the element. The energy of the element isfocused upon being what it is. Fixed signs don't say, “Here I am,” they say,“This is what I am.” The fixed signs are represented in the Thoth Tarot by theKerubic emblems found on the Hierophant and the Universe.Mutable signs are more subtle. They do not express the energy of the cardinal orthe stability of the fixed, and by comparison seem weak. But the mutable signsare not weak; they're just sensitive and willing to give of themselves. They areflexible and can adapt the element to the adventures of an ever-changinguniverse.Moon: Atu XVIII of the Thoth Tarot.

One very simple mode of division is by four (corresponding to the fourletters of the Tetragrammaton, images [images/303.jpg], Yod Hé Vau Hé). Thetarot is, in many ways, an expression of this fourfold division. The four partsof the soul and some of their correspondences are as follows:Nephesh—The Animal Soul: The first and lowest of the four parts of the soul;corresponds to the final Hé of the Tetragrammaton, the element of earth, thesuit of Disks in the tarot, and to Assiah, the material world, the first andlowest of the four Qabalistic worlds.Ruach—The IntellectThe second of the four parts of the soul; corresponds to the Vau of theTetragrammaton, the element of air, the suit of Swords in the tarot, and toYetzirah, the formative world.Neshamah—The Soul IntuitionThe third and second highest of the four parts of the soul; corresponds to thefrst Hé of the Tetragrammaton, the element of water, the suit of Cups in thetarot, and to Briah, the creative world.Chiah—The Life ForceThe fourth and highest of the four parts of the soul; corresponds to the Yod ofthe Tetragrammaton, the element of fre, the suit of Wands in the tarot, and toAtziluth, the archetypal world.Pé—images [images/297.jpg]: Mouth.

This is the orderin which the planetary spheres (sephiroth 3 through 9) are arranged on the Treeof Life. These seven planets are also allotted (in this same repeating order) tothe thirty-six small cards of the Thoth Tarot, starting with Saturn on the Fiveof Wands (at 0° Leo) and changing every decan (10°), until every decan of theyear has been assigned a planet. (The last decan of Pisces and the first decanof Aries are both assigned the planet Mars.)Precession of the Equinox: See Astrological Age.Prince: In the Thoth Tarot, the Prince is the secondary male figure of the courtcards.

Her position on the Tree of Life is the tenth sephira, Malkuth. (See YodHé Vau Hé.) She is the daughter of the Knight and Queen and sister/lover of thePrince. (In certain ways, she is also viewed as the daughter of the Prince.) Sheis the earthy aspect of her suit and is shown standing. In the WesternMysteries, the quest for spiritual liberation is characterized in the story of asleeping Princess (each of us) who is awakened by a Prince (our Holy GuardianAngel), who marries the Princess and makes her Queen (God the Mother), which atthe same time makes him the King (God the Father). Unlike the Knight, Queen, andPrince, the Princess does not rule a 30° period of the year. Instead, she isconsidered the throne of the aces and rules, with her ace, one quarter of thesurface of the Earth. See chapter 11 [chap11.xhtml].Princess Scale of Color: The Princess scale represents the lowest, most mixedand polluted levels of light.

Thesefour worlds reflect on a macrocosmic level the four microcosmic aspects of thehuman soul. The tarot is, in many ways, an expression of this four-folddivision. The four Qabalistic worlds and some of their correspondences are asfollows:Assiah—The Material World.The lowest of the four Qabalistic worlds; corresponds to the final Hé of theTetragrammaton, the element of earth, and the suit of Disks in the tarot. InAssiah, the impurities produced by the degeneration of the light as it passesthrough the worlds above it (Atziluth, Briah, and Yetzirah) are crystallized toform the material world and human existence. Assiah's corresponding part in thehuman soul is the Nephesh—the animal soul.Yetzirah—The Formative WorldThe second to the lowest of the four Qabalistic worlds; corresponds to the Vauof the Tetragrammaton, the element of air, and the suit of Swords in the tarot.In Yetzirah, the universal organization of Briah becomes specific, and ahierarchy of angels with individual duties is established. This world is themind and the mind's eye of the deity. Yetzirah's corresponding part in the humansoul is the Ruach—the intellect.Briah—The Creative WorldThe third and second highest of the four Qabalistic worlds; corresponds to thefirst Hé of the Tetragrammaton, the element water; and the suit of Cups in thetarot. In Briah, the pure light of Atziluth begins to become organized. This isthe throne and abode of the highest archangels and could be viewed as the heartof the deity. Briah's corresponding part in the human soul is the Neshamah—thedivine soul intuition.Atziluth—The Archetypal WorldThe highest of the four Qabalistic worlds; corresponds to the Yod in theTetragrammaton, the element fire, and the suit of Wands in the tarot. InAtziluth, the male and female aspects of the deity are united in bliss. Theremaining three worlds (Briah, Yetzirah, and Assiah) are the product of thisunion, and continue to diminish in purity. Atziluth could be considered the willof the deity in its purest aspect. Atzuluth's corresponding part in the humansoul it is the Chiah—the life force.Qoph—images [images/306.jpg]: Back of Head.

The Crowned andConquering Child of the union of Nuit and Hadit. As Nuit's expansion and Hadit'scontraction are both infinite, so too must be their points of contact. Thisinfinite contact creates a field of operation in which the universe canmanifest. ‘He is, however, known under his special name, Heru-ra-ha. A doublegod; his extroverted form is Ra-hoor-khuit; and his passive or introverted formHoor-pa-kraat.'”339 [notes.xhtml#f2t339]“Qabalists may wish to consider the similarities to the Third Veil of theNegative proceeding Kether, AIN SOPH AUR (Limitless Light); also Kether itself.In one respect He is the fundamental archetype of the God-Man, and the HolyGuardian Angel.”340 [notes.xhtml#f2t340]Rajas: See Gunas.Resh—images [images/307.jpg]: Head or Face.

The angel names are created by adding (to the end ofeach of the three letter names) the letters IH (for an angel of mercy) or theletters AL (for an angel of judgment).

Engraved above theentrance to the Abbey was the Abbey's motto, Fay çe que vouldras, “Do what thouwilt.” In that work, it was the watchword of individual freedom.

This, for lack of a better word, is our will. If eachperson properly understands and executes this will, his or her life will be inharmony with the forces and energies of the entire universe and we will fulfillour full potential as cosmic citizens.Thelemite: One who attempts to discover, then execute, his or her will.

By 1920, Crowley still held the world's record for anumber of mountaineering feats, including the greatest pace uphill (4, 000 feetin 83 minutes) at over 16,000 feet on Mexico's Iztaccihuatl in 1900; the firstascent of the Nevado de Toluca by a solitary climber 1901; and his 1902 assaulton K2, where he spent 65 days on the Baltoro glacier.11 [chap1.xhtml#fn11]. Ghostwriting for Evangeline Adams, Crowley wrote the bulkof the material first published under her name, including her classic texts,Astrology: Your Place in the Sun (1927) and Astrology: Your Place Among theStars (1930). These works made astrology a household word in America and Europeand catapulted Adams to celebrated status as “Astrologer to Wall Street andWashington.” Recently, Crowley's co-authorship has been graciously acknowledgedby the Adams estate and has resulted in the release of Aleister Crowley andEvangeline Adams, The General Principles of Astrology (York Beach, ME: Red Wheel/ Weiser, 2001).12 [chap1.xhtml#fn12]. It is often forgotten that the United States was veryclose to entering the First World War on Germany's side. Much to the horror ofthe German Foreign Ministry, Crowley's editorials made it appear that it wasGermany's intention (in fact, its foreign policy) to engage in unrestrictedsubmarine warfare against civilian shipping. Even though this was, at the time,an outrageous falsehood, Crowley's editorials were used to create an anti-Germanhysteria that would eventually sweep the United States into the conflict onEngland's side. In a very real way, Aleister Crowley saved his beloved Englandusing only his pen as a magical wand.13 [chap1.xhtml#fn13].

I believe the basis of the feelingis that there should be a special prerogative to understand spiritual matters, afeeling of heirship. The fact remains that you do not employ such arrogantimpertinence with regard to such subjects as logic and mathematics.

To induce the visions of The Vision and The Voice Crowleyutilized Enochian magick, a powerful technique of ceremonial skrying (ortraveling the spirit vision) frst used by Edward Kelley and Dr. John Dee, thefamous English mathematician and counselor to Elizabeth I.
