And, like all the previous writers on Crowley, I owe a majordebt to my friend John Symonds; there is a tendency among modern Crowleydisciples to denigrate The Great Beast for its attitude of genial scepticism;yet it is hard to imagine how it could ever be replaced as the standardbiography. I also owe many insights to the books of Kenneth Grant, particularlyto his Typhonian trilogy.

Afriend who had asked the Finchley public library to obtain the book for him wastold indignantly that nothing would induce them to spend the ratepayer's moneyon such vicious rubbish; the library even declined to try and borrow a copythrough the inter-loan system. I was intrigued; what had Crowley done that heshould be regarded as an untouchable by a London librarian? So when I found acopy in the Holborn library, I read it straight through in a weekend. On thewhole, I must admit, I found Crowley irritating; he made me think of Shaw'scomment about Mrs Patrick Campbell: ‘an ego like a raging tooth’. His life readlike a moral fable on the dangers of exhibitionism.One thing puzzled me: the attitude of the biographer to his subject. Symondsseems to take the sensible view that Crowley's magic was a lot of self-deceivingnonsense. How then should one understand the following passage:Conjuring up Abra-Melin demons is a ticklish business. Crowley successfullyraised them—‘the lodge and the terrace’, [he wrote], ‘soon became peopled withshadowy shapes,’—but he was unable to control them, for Oriens, Paimon, Ariton,Amaimon and their hundred and eleven servitors escaped from the lodge, enteredthe house and wrought the following havoc: his coachman, hitherto a teetotaler,fell into delirium tremens; a clairvoyant whom he had brought from Londonreturned there and became a prostitute; his housekeeper, unable to bear theeeriness of the place, vanished, and a madness settled upon one of the workmenemployed on the estate and he tried to kill the noble Lord Boleskine [one ofCrowley's aliases.] Even the butcher down in the village came in for his quotaof bad luck through Crowley's casually jotting down on one of his bills thenames of two demons, viz. Elerion and Mabakiel, which mean respectively laughterand lamentation. Conjointly these two words signify ‘unlooked for sorrowsuddenly descending upon happiness’. In the butcher's case, alas, it was onlytoo true, for while cutting up a joint for a customer he accidentally severedthe femoral artery and promptly died.Symonds’ tone of light irony implies that he thinks this was all Crowley'simagination; in which case, what really did happen? And what really happened inthat Cairo Hotel room on 8 April 1904, when a voice began to speak out of theair, and dictated to Crowley The Book of the Law? Symonds avoids the questionwith the comment: ‘To enter, however, into the theological side of Crowleyanityis beyond the scope of this biography’.Two or three years later, not long after the publication of my first book TheOutsider, I came upon Charles Richard Cammell's book Aleister Crowley, The Man,the Mage, the Poet and, as I read this, I found it hard to believe that he andSymonds were talking about the same man. Cammell came across Crowley's poetry inthe early 1930s, and immediately became convinced that Crowley was a poet ofgenius. When he read Crowley's autobiography, The Confessions, he had no doubtthat it deserved to rank with Cellini, Rousseau, and Casanova. In London,Cammell was introduced to Crowley—who was now sixty—and they became friends. Thefriendship was cemented when Cammell went to dinner and ate one of Crowley'shottest curries—washed down with vodka—without turning a hair. Crowley had asadistic sense of humour, and loved nothing more than to see his guests rush tothe bathroom to wash down a mouthful of his curry with pints of cold water; whenCammell asked for a second helping and a refill of vodka, ‘Crowley wasconquered…He owned later that I had defeated him over that curry.’Yet Cammell also seems to beg the question of Crowley's magical powers.Describing Crowley's conjuration of the Abra-Melin demons, he also quotesCrowley's own statement that the house became filled with shadowy shapes. ButCammell adds the interesting comment that he believes Crowley's later badluck—his lifetime of near-poverty and literary failure—was due to his breakingof the sacred oath he took in the Abra-Melin ritual—an oath to use his powersonly for good and to submit himself to the divine will. ‘To me Crowley appearsthenceforth to have been a man accursed: he lost all sense of good and evil, helost his love, his fortune, his honour, his magical powers, even in large parthis poetic genius…’Not long after reading Cammell's book I met him at the opening of a paintingexhibition in Chelsea—a gentle, bearded man who was startled when I told himthat I had recently acquired my own copy of his book from New York; he wasunaware that it had been pirated. As we stood in the crowd, with glasses inhand, it was difficult to speak seriously about Crowley; but Cammell confirmedthat he regarded Crowley as a great misunderstood genius, an ‘outsider’, andthat he thought Symonds’ book was little more than a gross libel. Cammell diednot long after our meeting, so I had no chance to learn more about Crowley fromhim at first hand.In the late 1960s, I wrote my own account of Crowley in a book called TheOccult, and a year or two later, entered into correspondence with anotherCrowley disciple, Francis Israel Regardie. Regardie—who made himself a badreputation among ‘occultists’ by publishing the secret rituals of the GoldenDawn society—also detested the Symonds biography and was not greatly pleasedwith my own chapter on Crowley. But when I read Regardie's book on Crowley, TheEye in the Triangle, I found it hard to understand his loyalty. Regardie hadbecome a Crowley enthusiast in 1926, at the age of 19, when he read Crowley'sclassic on yoga Book Four, and wrote to Crowley; the result was an invitation tojoin Crowley in Paris as his secretary. Within a few months—as a result of theintervention of Regardie's sister—they were officially expelled from thecountry. Regardie finally drifted to London and joined the magical society ofthe Golden Dawn. After Crowley, he found this insipid and resigned, thenhastened the collapse of the society by publishing their rituals. He began towrite his own books on magic, heavily influenced by Jung. And when he sent oneof these to Crowley, the master replied to the disciple with some sharpcriticisms. Regardie admitted later that he should have accepted the rebukes;instead, he wrote Crowley a silly letter beginning:Darling Alice [an insulting diminutive of Crowley's Christian name, and a slyreference to his bisexuality]. You really are a contemptible bitch…Crowley made no reply, but circulated an anonymous letter about Regardie thatseethed with venom:Israel Regudy was born in the neighbourhood of Mile End Road, in one of thevilest slums in London…Apart from his inferiority complex, he was found to besuffering from severe chronic constipation and measures were taken to cure himof this, and also his ingrained habit of onanism. The cure in the latter casewas successful, but Regudy abused his freedom by going under some railway archesand acquiring an intractable gonorrhoea…Regardie actually prints this letter in full in The Eye in the Triangle, andadds:It took me a long time to forgive him for this disgusting bit ofself-projection. It is only within the last few years that my admiration for himas a great mystic has triumphed over my resentment and bitterness, enabling meto put aside my contempt for the nasty, petty, vicious louse that occasionallyhe was on the level of practical human relations…So it seemed that, in spite of his indignation about Symonds’ ‘libel’, Regardiewas in basic agreement with its view of Crowley's character. And I have toconfess that I found myself wondering whether Regardie's decision to ‘forgive’Crowley was not simply a piece of opportunism. After all, there had been aCrowley revival in the 1960s; the Beatles had even included his portrait amongtheir culture-heroes on the cover of their Sergeant Pepper record. Regardie sethimself up as Crowley's chief American disciple, and republished many of hisbooks, no doubt (since Crowley left no family) greatly to his own profit.Now, as I began to read the Crowley works that were now being republished, Icame to understand why Regardie and Cammell admired him so much. Crowley has aclear, logical intellect and he can write with Shavian clarity. The EightLectures on Yoga, for example, have a breezy vitality, and reveal a mind ofremarkable range; he is as comfortable talking about science and mathematics asabout mysticism and poetry. When he was in a ‘magical retirement’ in a cottagein New Hampshire in 1916, he had with him a copy of Shaw's Androcles and theLion, whose long introduction on Christianity is one of Shaw's most importantworks. Crowley found he disagreed with much of it, and wrote a commentary on itcalled The Gospel According to St Bernard Shaw.1 [part0005.html#fnr1] He wroteit without thought of publication, and it is one of the best commentaries onShaw ever written. It has remarkable penetration—its criticisms of Shaw'ssocialism are practically unanswerable—and is full of Crowley's typical humour:There is no such thing as self-denial. Self-denial is merely the self-indulgenceof self-denying people. There is an old, old story of an old, old woman, verybenighted, who had not heard of Christianity till the Scripture reader came andread her the story of the Crucifixion, at which she wept copiously; but she soondried her tears, remarking, ‘After all, it was ‘is ‘obby.’Works like these soon convinced me that Crowley was far more than aself-advertiser. But that still left the major question unanswered: What aboutthe magic? Surely that had to be total nonsense?On this matter I also found myself changing my opinion. In The Occult, I hadtaken it for granted that witchcraft was basically an absurd superstition. So,for example, when I presented the case of the North Berwick witches, executed in1591 for raising a storm in which they tried to drown James I, I had no doubtthat this was basically a case of hysteria and superstitious credulity. Yetelsewhere in the book, I accept evidence that African witch doctors can performauthentic ‘magic’. My friend Negley Farson had described to me how he had seenwitch doctors conjure rain out of a clear sky. Another friend, Martin Delany,described how the local Nigerian witch doctor assured his company that thetorrential rain, which had lasted for five weeks, would stop for two hours for agarden party. The rain stopped immediately before the party was due to start,and the sun blazed out of a clear sky; it started again immediately after theparty finished.Why should I have taken it for granted that Scottish witches would be unable toexercise control over the weather? In fact, there was strong evidence that theBerwick witches possessed real powers. There was a point during the examinationwhen the king himself decided it was all superstitious nonsense; whereupon oneof the chief accused, Agnes Sampson, whispered in his ear something he had saidto his bride on her wedding night; no one but the king and his bride could haveknown about it. The king changed his mind about the witches. Another of theaccused, John Fian, had been secretary to the Earl of Bothwell, who had areputation as a dabbler in black magic; and Bothwell had good reason to intrigueagainst his cousin the king. When the king was sailing back from Norway with hisbride, a tremendous storm had almost sunk the ship, and it was this storm thatthe witches had confessed to raising, with Fian's help. One writer on the caseasserts that Fian's confession was forced upon him by the horrible torture ofthe boot, which crushed his leg; yet twenty-four hours later, Fian escaped andmade his way home; clearly, he was not so badly injured…When I re-read the case,I had to admit that, if we once allow the supposition that the Berwick witchespossessed the same powers as African witch doctors, then it was conceivable thatthey were guilty as charged—and as, indeed, they confessed.But how could a ‘witch’ influence the weather? My own supposition—which, I haveto admit, left me vaguely unsatisfied—was that it was some form of ‘mind overmatter.’ Dr Rolf Alexander's book The Power of the Mind, has a series ofphotographs that purport to show how, on 12 September 1964, at Orillia, Ontario,Alexander concentrated on a group of clouds, and dissipated them within eightminutes; other clouds around remain unaffected. He used ‘psychokinesis’—‘mindover matter.’ But that, admittedly, is a long way from causing a full-scalestorm.Stories of Crowley's own powers suggest that his magic was also some hidden‘mind force.’ His friend Oliver Marlow Wilkinson described how, when Crowley wasin the room, a man began behaving like a dog—begged, barked, whined, andscratched at the door. Wilkinson's mother had seen Crowley cause another man toact like a dog. This, of course, sounds like some form of hypnosis. But theAmerican writer William Seabrook has a story of how Crowley demonstrated hismagical powers on Fifth Avenue. On a deserted stretch of pavement, Crowley fellinto step behind a man and imitated his walk. Then, suddenly, Crowley buckled atthe knees and squatted for a moment on his haunches; the man collapsed on to thepavement. As they helped him to his feet, he looked around in a puzzled mannerfor the banana skin.This is clearly not hypnosis, but it sounds like some curious form oftelepathy—of the establishment of a ‘sympathy’ between Crowley and his victim.In the 19th century, hypnotists were much intrigued by a phenomenon they called‘community of sensation.’ When a good hypnotic subject was placed in a trance,he would wince if the hypnotist stuck a pin in his own hand, and snatch his handaway if the hypnotist held his own hand above a candle flame; he would smile ifthe hypnotist tasted sugar, and grimace if he tasted salt. It sounded as ifCrowley was using some variant of this principle.It can be seen that, like most members of the Society for Psychical Research, Iwas inclined to look for explanations of the ‘paranormal’ in terms of scientificprinciples that we do not yet understand. And one of my best efforts in thisdirection concerned that strange phenomenon known as the poltergeist, orrattling ghost. Poltergeists are one of the best-attested phenomena in the wholerange of psychical research. Hundreds—probably thousands—of cases have beenobserved by trained observers. But the Society for Psychical Research soonnoticed that in nearly every case, there is a child or an adolescent in thehouse, and that when this person is not present, the phenomena—dancingfurniture, banging noises, objects flying through the air—stop happening. AndFreud's theory of the unconscious mind provided a more-or-less scientific theoryto explain the phenomena: that they are not the work of disembodied spirits, butof violent tensions in this unknown region of the mind. Jung coined the term‘extériorisation phenomena’ to describe it, and tells the story of how, when hewas arguing with Freud about the ‘occult’, and Freud was being contemptuouslysceptical, he—Jung—experienced a burning sensation in his diaphragm, and therewas a sudden loud bang from the bookcase. Jung said: ‘That is an example ofexteriorization phenomena.’ ‘Bosh!’ said Freud. ‘It is not bosh, and to proveit, there will be another bang in a moment.’ And a second loud detonationsounded in the bookcase. Freud was rather shaken. If Jung was correct inbelieving that he somehow caused the bangs, this seems to be a fairly conclusiveproof that poltergeists are actually a mischievous aspect of the unconsciousmind.But that still fails to explain how the unconscious mind causes objects to flythrough the air—or how the ‘ghosts’ can converse in a code of raps, or eventhrough human-sounding voices. Parapsychologists refer to poltergeist phenomenaas ‘spontaneous psychokinesis’, but this also begs the question. There is strongevidence that some gifted subjects can move tiny objects—such as postage stampsand compass needles—by concentrating on them, but they are hardly in the sameclass as the poltergeist, which has been known to move a Landrover for severalhundred yards.It was not until I began researching a book on the poltergeist that I engaged ina systematic study of poltergeist phenomena through the ages. One thingimmediately became obvious: that when communication has been established withthe ‘entity’, it invariably claims to be some kind of spirit. And Guy Playfair,who had spent many years studying poltergeists at first hand in Brazil, told methat he had no doubt that most poltergeists are spirits. On the day afterspeaking to him, I went to interview a family in Pontefract who had been‘haunted’ by a highly destructive poltergeist—it had smashed every breakableobject in the house—which claimed to be the ghost of a monk who had been hangedon a gallows at the spot. The more I studied this case, and others like it, themore I became convinced that Playfair was right. By the time I began to writePoltergeist! there was not a shred of doubt in my mind: poltergeists are exactlywhat they claim to be, disembodied spirits. I found this conclusion thoroughlyembarrassing; I would far rather have clung to the more respectable ‘spontaneouspsychokinesis’ theory. But honesty compelled me to admit that it simply fails toexplain the facts as completely as the spirit theory.Playfair's book about his researches in Brazil—The Flying Cow—brought anotherstartling insight: that there is a connection between poltergeist phenomena andmagic. In the first case he investigated, in Sao Paulo, a Portuguese family wasbeing subjected to continual persecution by a poltergeist: oddly enough, it hadfollowed them from house to house. There were no children in the family: the sonand daughter were both adults. The poltergeist kept them awake at night, setbedding on fire, and soaked it with water. There was some evidence of blackmagic: a photograph stitched with thread had been found in the house. Playfairheard the bangs, and witnessed other phenomena—at one point, a wardrobe full ofclothes was set on fire and would have burned the house down if it had not beendiscovered.The family finally decided to call in a candomblé specialist (candomblé is aform of voodoo). This man told the family that they were being persecuted byblack magic—the troubles were connected with the son's marriage. And after theperformance of various magical rites, the poltergeist left.Playfair learned that ‘voodoo’ magicians or witch doctors can summonpoltergeists, and direct them to cause trouble to certain people, and his bookcontains many other examples of this practice. Witches have always, of courseclaimed to make use of spirits. If Playfair was right, then this was quiteliterally true.I must admit that all this left me feeling rather shaken. I had been studying‘the occult’ for more than ten years, and had never doubted for a moment thatmost of its mysteries can be explained in terms of the unknown powers of thehuman mind—telepathy, clairvoyance, psychokinesis, and so on. It was startlingto suddenly be confronted with evidence for the existence of ‘spirits.’ I hadnever actually taken the position that there are no such things as spirits; butI had always assumed that, if they exist, they play only a small part inparanormal phenomena. Now I found myself obliged to recognize that they play acentral part.It was also at about this time that I discovered Max Freedom Long's book TheSecret Science Behind Miracles—an off-putting title that does no justice to thecontents of the book. During his years in Hawaii after the first world war, Longdevoted himself to the study of the ancient native religion of the kahunas, the‘keepers of the secret’. He soon learned that stories about the ‘death prayer’were not the superstitious absurdity he had at first assumed, and that evenEuropean doctors admitted that when a patient was brought into hospitalsuffering from the ‘death prayer’, there was very little they could do for them.Long's researches left him in no doubt that the kahuna magicians made use of aform of voodoo which involved making use of ‘spirits’ to drain victims of theirvital energies until they died. Long's chief mentor, Dr Brigham, had oncesucceeded in saving one of these intended victims, and in directing the ‘deathprayer’ back at the witch doctor who was responsible; the result was the deathof the witch doctor.It sounded preposterous, yet the evidence was overwhelming. It all pointed inthe same direction: that poltergeists are ‘spirits’ who are able to manifestthemselves only by making use of the energy of human beings—usually those whoare emotionally disturbed. They appear to be of extremely low intelligence andto behave like bored juvenile delinquents. And they seem perfectly happy toassist ‘magicians’ in creating mischief, since this is the kind of thing theyenjoy anyway.Not long after the book came out, I encountered an interesting case thatconfirmed my findings. A young married woman wrote to ask my advice about adisturbing series of events that had happened to her in Brazil. She began tosuspect that her husband was being unfaithful to her with a native woman. And awoman who claimed to be a clairvoyant stopped her spontaneously in a street andtold her that she had been bewitched. Life seemed to turn into a series of minorproblems and obstacles. The relationship with her husband became worse andworse. One day, as she sat in the bath, her wedding ring began to slip from herfinger. She watched it with astonishment. It was a fairly tight fit, yet itslipped down her finger as if it had suddenly become loose. Then it fell intothe water. When she got out of the bath, she decided not to pull out the plug,in case she lost the ring; instead, she carefully bailed out the water with asaucepan. But when the bath was empty, there was no ring.A few weeks later, convinced that her marriage was about to break up, she obeyeda sudden urge to go and see her husband at his place of work and make one finalplea. It worked; their differences dissolved and they made up. Back at home, shefelt exhausted and decided to have a bath, and while she was in the bath, shedecided to wash her knickers. As she picked them up to squeeze out the soapywater, her wedding ring fell out of them. Her story, far more detailed than Ihave reported, left me in no doubt that she was another victim of voodoo, andthat her rival was probably responsible for the ‘spell’. It was an interestingexample of what can be accomplished by magic.This recognition may have placed me beyond the pale of respectable scientificinvestigators, but it had the advantage of unifying my own views on theparanormal. Modern shamans or witch doctors declare that their power comes fromthe dead, from spirits, and that they perform their ‘magic’ with the aid ofspirits. Their only power is that of mediumship, the ability to place themselvesin contact with spirits. Shamans and witches have made the same claim throughoutthe ages, although they often insist that the ‘spirits’ are not only those ofthe dead; there are also nature spirits, or elementals.In 1926, Montague Summers—whom Richard Cammell introduced to Crowley—achievedovernight fame with a book called The History of Witchcraft and Demonology. Itwas an extremely scholarly book, part of a series on the history ofcivilization. What startled the reviewers was that Summers seemed to believeevery word he wrote about the ‘enormous wickedness’ of witches and warlocks.H.G. Wells launched a vituperative attack on it in the Sunday Express. He couldunderstand how a Catholic could believe in the reality of evil; but the notionthat human beings could have intercourse with demonic forces evidently struckhim as sheer intellectual perversity; he obviously thought Summers was either acharlatan or an idiot. When I first read the book, in my teens, I thoughtSummers had his tongue in his cheek. Now, as I re-read it, I could see howSummers could believe in witchcraft without in any way compromising hisintellectual integrity. I could also see that when Summers wrote: ‘Modernspiritualism is merely witchcraft revived’, he was not all that far from thetruth. Throughout the ages, shamans and witches have established contact with‘spirits’, and tried to use them for their own purposes; the Elizabethanmagician John Dee had no such talents himself, and used a ‘scryer’ (descryer, orone who sees), another name for a medium. During the age of reason, belief inwitchcraft finally evaporated; by the mid-19th century, scientists were totallyconvinced that all forms of ‘occultism’ were a relic of the bad old days ofsuperstition. Then the curious poltergeist phenomena in the home of the Foxsisters in New York state caused a nationwide sensation. All over America,people began holding seances and discovered that it was easy to get ‘phenomena’.The ‘spirits’ ordered the Fox sisters to found a new religion calledSpiritualism, and prophesied its success. Within a few years, it had establisheditself all over the world, and the scientists raged and uttered denunciations asthis new wave of ‘superstition’ made thousands of converts. In fact, thependulum was simply swinging back in the opposite direction, and the world wasrediscovering the most ancient of religions: shamanism.In Russia, a lively overweight girl named Helena Hahn began to see ‘spirits’ atan early age, and realised she was a natural medium. She made an unwise marriageat sixteen to a middle-aged man named Blavatsky, and left him almostimmediately. As she wandered around Europe as a travelling companion to variousladies, the tidal wave of spiritualism came rolling across the Atlantic. HelenaBlavatsky became a friend of one of the most remarkable mediums of all time, theyoung American Daniel Dunglas Home, who could cause tables to float up to theceiling and wash his face in red hot coals. Helena realised that her own psychicpowers could probably be used to her advantage in America, and landed in NewYork in 1873, at the age of forty-two. Success was slow to come, but four yearslater, she achieved overnight fame with a book called Isis Unveiled, whichbecame a bestseller. She explained to her disciples that she had acquired heresoteric knowledge in Tibet, where she had been taught by ‘secret masters’.These masters of wisdom were in charge of human evolution on earth, and theycommunicated with her nightly, and sometimes during the day, by causing notes todrop from the air. The society that Helena Blavatsky formed with the aid of heradmirer, Colonel Olcott, was called the Theosophical Society, and was devoted todisseminating the wisdom of the Masters. The year after Isis Unveiled, MadameBlavatsky decided to move the Society to India, where it achieved considerablesuccess. A book about her teachings—or rather, those of the Masters—calledEsoteric Buddhism by A.P. Sinnett also became a bestseller, and spread thedoctrine far and wide; there were soon branches of the Theosophical Society inevery capital in Europe.Madame Blavatsky's downfall came in 1884, when the newly-formed Society forPsychical Research sent a young investigator to India to study her claims. ButMadame Blavatsky was absent when Richard Hodgson arrived, and he fell into thehands of her disaffected ex-housekeepers, the Coulombs, who soon convinced himthat she was a fraud. To some extent, they may have been telling the truth; yetno one who studies the evidence can doubt that she was a genuine and verypowerful medium. Hodgson's report denounced her. Many followers remainedfaithful, but thousands of others left the movement. Madame Blavatsky moved toLondon, where she spent the last few years of her life writing a vast workcalled The Secret Doctrine; she died at the age of sixty. Yet in spite of hertribulations, and the general view that she was an old charlatan, HelenaBlavatsky exercised an enormous influence on her time. Theosophy arrived atexactly the right moment. By the second half of the 19th century, there was adeep and powerful craving for some new form of religion. Darwinism had caused amajor spiritual crisis. Many clergymen were beset by ‘doubts’ and felt obligedto resign their livings. In In Memoriam Tennyson expresses the despair of thesensitive intellectual when faced with an apparently meaningless and Godlessuniverse. There was a general feeling that science had deprived man of all hope,and that it was time for a backswing of the pendulum. So when, in 1883, A.P.Sinnett assured readers of Esoteric Buddhism that there really were ‘secretmasters’ in Tibet, and that they possessed the wisdom of the ages, heaccidentally touched that spring of almost morbid craving for new spiritualvalues. Moreover, Sinnett was no crank; he was the respectable editor of India'smost respectable newspaper, the voice of the establishment. Esoteric Buddism waslike the falling rock that starts a landslide. The poet W.B. Yeats read it, andwas wildly excited. He handed it to his friend Charles Johnston, who immediatelyrushed to London to get permission to set up a Dublin branch of the TheosophicalSociety. And the same thing was happening in Paris, Berlin, Rome, Vienna. (InVienna, a young man named Rudolf Steiner, who was also striving to create hisown revolt against materialism, was impressed by the book although he thoughtthe talk of ‘secret masters’ too materialistic.) For all her faults, and for allthe chaotic obscurity of her major works, Madame Blavatsky provided somethingthat thousands were searching for.Four years after the publication of Esoteric Buddhism a London coroner named DrWynn Westcott somehow came into possession of an ancient-looking manuscriptwritten in a cipher that looked like a mixture of ancient Greek and astrologicalsymbols. Westcott was interested in Freemasonry and occultism. He cracked thecipher, and discovered that the manuscript contained five magical rituals. Heasked his friend Samuel Liddell Mathers, an eccentric scholar, to help himexpand the material so the rituals could be performed. He also, he claimed,found among the manuscript pages the address of a certain Fraulein Sprengel inStuttgart. He wrote to her, and learned that the rituals were the property of aGerman occult group called Die Goldene Dämmerung—the Golden Dawn—and sheauthorised him to set up a London branch of this magical order. So, in 1888, theHermetic Order of the Golden Dawn came into being in London. Its purpose was thetraditional purpose of magic: to establish contact with ‘higher spiritualrealms’ by means of magical ritual and disciplines. Like the TheosophicalSociety, it touched some chord of intellectual craving, and soon had branches inEdinburgh, Weston-super-Mare and Bradford. The influence of Madame Blavatsky maybe gauged from its complete title: the Isis-Urania Temple of the Golden Dawn.But there was another influence that was equally powerful: the magician of whomCrowley later believed he was a reincarnation: Eliphas Lévi, the author of Dogmaand Ritual of High Magic. Lévi, whose real name was Alphonse Louis Constant, wasa failed priest who became a left-wing journalist. Then Constant became thedisciple of a strange Polish nobleman named Wronski who believed that he haddiscovered the ultimate secret of life: how to use the sense-impressions of alifetime to create ultimate reality inside one's own head. Wronski's wifethought he was a god, and so must have been surprised when he died in 1853. ButConstant had met him in the year before his death, and after cataloguingWronski's manuscripts, he plunged into the study of occultism. And in 1855 and1856 he published his two-volume work on ‘high magic’. Like Esoteric Buddism,this also began with an assertion of a mysterious secret doctrine that had beenpassed down the ages, which is ‘everywhere the same and everywhere carefullyconcealed.’ In that romantic era, the book achieved a wide influence. TheEnglish novelist Bulwer Lytton was greatly impressed by Lévi, and portrayed himas the magician in his most famous story The Haunted and the Haunters. He wasalso fascinated by Levi's claim to have conjured up the shade of the magicianApollonius of Tyana through magic rituals. Lévi claimed that the spirit answeredhis questions telepathically, and caused his arm to become numb by touching it.Lévi died in 1875, two years before Madame Blavatsky was launched to fame byIsis Unveiled, but he was regarded as a kind of saint of the new occultmovement. Modern readers of his books on magic will find them disappointing. Hisknowledge of magic was obviously far smaller than he would like us to believe;for example, he sets himself up as an expert on the Hebrew Kabbalah withoutknowing a word of Hebrew. In short, Lévi was a mixture of poet and charlatan,and his books owe more to imagination than to scholarship.The reader who based his ideas of magic on Lévi's books might feel justified inassuming that it is all self-deception and wishful thinking. This would bepremature. In fact, many anthropological works contain accounts of shamanisticmagic that make it clear that it can and does work. There are, for example,innumerable accounts of fire-walking. In 1899, a New Zealand magistrate, ColonelGudgeon, went to watch a Maori fire-walking ceremony, and felt apprehension whenhe was invited to join in. But the words ‘I hand my mana, my power, over to you’had the effect of making his feet immune to the red hot cinders, and heexperienced only a tingling sensation. Max Freedom Long's mentor Dr Brigham hadless faith, and declined to walk on the hot lava in a volcano without wearinghis heavy boots. In the few seconds it took him to run across the lava, theboots were burnt off his feet, the soles flapping loose. Yet the kahunasstrolled across with only a few leaves on their feet.The trick, it seems, lies in the mental preparation. George and Helen Sandwith,who described the fire-walking ceremony in Fiji, noted that the essentialfeature was that the fire-walkers’ were charged with some unknown type ofenergy.. and ten days of ritual preparation were devoted to this.’ This enabledthem to walk across a fire-pit so hot that it could cause scorching at adistance of twelve feet. In the mid-1980s, fire-walking spiritual cults spreadfrom America to Great Britain, and were featured on television; perfectlyordinary people demonstrated that it was possible to walk on hot coals. But hereagain, it was clear that the essential feature was the mental preparationbeforehand—the meditation, and the creation of a mood of total self-confidence.All this would seem to indicate that the human mind has unsuspected powers overthe body, but that these powers must be aroused from the depths of the mind.Lévi prepared himself for his invocation of Apollonius of Tyana by observing avegetarian diet for three weeks beforehand, and fasting completely for the lastweek; during this time he meditated constantly on Apollonius and held imaginaryconversations with him. The result of such preparation and concentration is toarouse some deep, unified will-force in the unconscious mind: what Crowley wasto call ‘the true will’. One of Shaw's Ancients in Back to Methuselah says: ‘Thebrain shall not fail when the will is in earnest.’ It would seem that Shaw hadstumbled upon one of the basic principles of ritual magic. Aleister Crowleywould devote his life to the exploration and analysis of this secret.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0005.html#fn1]. Published in 1974 as Crowley on Christ, edited by FrancisKing."},{"pageContent":"TwoThe Reluctant ChristianTHROUGHOUT his life, Crowley had serious public relations problems; he waswidely regarded as a warped and depraved exhibitionist. And this was not due, asin the case of so many ‘outsiders’, to the incomprehension of the generalpublic. It was due to a silly, schoolboyish desire to cock a snook at Victorianmorality. So, for example, the marginal notes to a 1906 essay containharmless-looking Latin phrases like ‘Adest Rosa Secreta Eros’ and ‘Quid UmbraturIn Mari’, the sole point of which is that their initial letters spell ‘arse’ and‘quim’; the initials of another sentence spell ‘piss’ and ‘cunt.’ But when thiswas read out in court in a libel case four years later—when a friend ofCrowley's named Jones was trying to defend himself against a particularly nastyjournalistic attack—it had the unfortunate effect of causing the verdict to goagainst Jones. The defence argument was that anyone who was a friend ofCrowley's had no reputation to lose, and the jury agreed.This lifelong craving to shock and outrage the respectable stemmed from thehidebound pietism of Crowley's family background. His mother and father werefanatical members of the sect of Plymouth Brethren, and the cornerstone of theirreligious convictions was a belief in hellfire. They believed that every word ofthe Bible was divinely inspired, and that the Day of Judgement would arrive inthe fairly near future, destroying everyone but members of their own sect.Crowley later described his mother as ‘a brainless bigot of the most narrow,logical and inhuman type’. The same seems to have applied to his father, EdwardCrowley, except that he possessed a high degree of dominance and vitality, sothat his son hero-worshipped him. Crowley's own opinion about his early yearscan be gathered from the title of the preface to his book The World's Tragedy:‘A Boyhood in Hell’.The elder Crowley was a ‘gentleman of leisure’, having inherited a flourishingbrewing business from his own father, also named Edward; the latter had set up aseries of ‘alehouses’ for the sale of his own beer, as well as ham and cheesesandwiches, and they became immensely popular with city clerks in the 1850s. Thefamily wealth is almost as important as the family bigotry in explainingCrowley's own rebellious and autocratic temperament. In spite of the pietism ofhis background he was thoroughly spoilt. ‘I was taught to expect every possibleluxury. Nothing was too good for me…When I came into my fortune [at twenty-one],I was utterly unprepared to use it with the most ordinary prudence, and all theinherent vices of my training had a perfect field day for their development.’The result, of course, was that he spent most of his later life in a povertythat he furiously resented; it accounts for the note of self-pity that runsthrough the nine hundred pages of his autobiography.Edward Alexander Crowley—who later coined the name Aleister—was born on 12October 1875, in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire. He comments typically: ‘It hasbeen remarked a strange coincidence that one small county should have givenEngland her two greatest poets—for one must not forget Shakespeare.’ And just incase the reader has never heard of Shakespeare, he adds his dates (1550–1616) inbrackets, getting his birth date wrong for good measure.When Crowley was six, the family moved from Leamington to Redhill, in Surrey.His comments about this period suggest that he was something of a snob andsomething of a bully. ‘Aristocratic feelings were extremely strong’, and he andhis playmates, who played games in which they were aristocrats, used to lie inwait for what they called ‘cads’—children from the local school—and bombard themwith peas and arrows. He was so convinced of his privileged position as one ofthe ‘masters’ that he one day charged a navvy working in a pit and knocked himdown, then bolted home. On another occasion he attacked an errand boy with anAlpenstock, and was alarmed when the boy pursued him back home, ‘when, ofcourse, the elders intervened’.Crowley's father was also something of a bully. When a lady called at the housefor a subscription in aid of soldiers, ‘he browbeat and bullied her into tears’.But he seems to have had a redeeming sense of humour. He told one of hiscongregations that he would prefer to preach to drunkards rather thanteetotalers, because abstainers might fail to recognize their need for Jesus.When someone pointed out that this opinion might have some connection with thefact that his money came from beer, he replied that he had been an abstainer fornineteen years, during which time he had shares in a brewery; now he drankalcohol, but his money was invested in a waterworks.Crowley's father died when the boy was eleven. It was partly his own fault;cancer of the tongue was diagnosed, but for religious reasons, Crowley seniordecided to treat the illness with some quack-form of electro-therapy. Away atboarding school, Crowley dreamed that his father had died, and later recalledsome peculiar quality in the dream that made him take it seriously; years later,he had a similar dream on the death of his mother. It seems clear that, in spiteof his aggressive ‘normality’, Crowley was basically psychic. Crowley's reactionto his father's death was to cease to be a model schoolboy, and to begin tomisbehave at school.His mother moved to London, to be near her brother, Tom Bond Bishop, ‘aprominent figure in religious and philanthropic circles’. He seems to have beenmuch the same kind of ‘brainless bigot’ as Crowley's mother, and inspired in theeleven year old boy a paroxysm of loathing which does much to explain his laterattitude towards Christians and Christianity. He devotes a page to castigatinghim in the autobiography, a passage that tells us as much about Crowley'sability to hold grudges as about his uncle's stupidity. ‘Perfidious andhypocritical…he was unctuous as Uriah Heep, and for the rest possessed the vicesof Joseph Surface and Tartuffe; yet, being without the human weakness which makethem possible, he was a more virtuous, and therefore a more odious villain.’What really enraged Crowley was that this uncle was a ‘right man’: ‘He wasinaccessible to doubt; he knew he was right on every point.’ Crowley later askedhim what a climber should do if his companion should fall, and the only way ofsaving his own life was to cut the rope. His uncle replied: ‘God would neverallow a man to be placed in such a position.’Uncle Tom started the process of turning Crowley into a rebel. A taste ofinjustice at school acted as a further catalyst. The school—in Cambridge—was runby Plymouth Brethren, and the headmaster encouraged tale-bearing. Some fellowpupil ‘with insane taint’ (Crowley always foams at the mouth when speaking ofthose who have done him down) told the headmaster that he had visited Crowley athome and found him drunk at the bottom of the stairs. Neither Crowley nor hismother was asked about this; the headmaster merely issued orders that Crowleywas to be ‘sent to Coventry’—that no master or boy should speak to him. For aterm and a half he became totally solitary, with no idea of what he had done.Finally his health broke down and he had to be removed. Crowley's account of theschool—of ‘trials’ of wrongdoers that began with long prayers, and of pupilsbeing half-flogged to death—make it clear why he became such a good hater ofevangelical Christians.His health was so poor that it was predicted that he would never reach the ageof twenty-one; so a doctor recommended a course of travelling around the countrywith a tutor. Crowley learned to climb mountains and fish for trout. The onlydrawback was that most of the tutors were chosen by Uncle Tom, and were of the‘sawny [Scottish], anaemic, priggish type.’ ‘Of course, I considered it my dutyto outwit them in every possible way and hunt up some kind of sin.’ One of them,the Rev. Fothergill, even tried to drown him after Crowley had thrown him out ofa boat. And it seems to have been immediately after this that Crowley succeededin hunting up his favourite kind of sin. ‘That night the gods still furtherfavoured me, for a village girl named Belle McKay found herself with nothingbetter to do than to roam with me amid the heather. We returned together quiteopenly and Fothergill threw up the sponge. He took me back to London the nextmorning. Breaking the journey at Carlisle, I repeated my victory with a buxomchambermaid.’Crowley's next tutor, the brother of the Dean of Westminster, did his best toseduce him. Crowley resisted—not, he admits, out of lack of inclination, butbecause he thought it was a trap to betray him to his family. The tutor laterapologised to Crowley, explaining that he had been led into evil ways by hiselder brother, a missionary. Crowley loves to tell this kind of story—the readercan almost hear him chortling and rubbing his hands. Like de Sade, he would loveto believe that every clergyman is a secret pervert.Subsequently, Uncle Tom made one of his rare mistakes with respect to tutors,and appointed a Bible salesman named Archibald Douglas who proved to be quitenormally human, and who introduced Crowley to drinking, smoking, racing,billiards, cards and women. ‘The nightmare world of Christianity vanished at thedawn. I fell in with a girl of the theatre in the first ten days at Torquay, andat that touch of human love the detestable mysteries of sex were transformedinto joy and beauty. The obsession of sin fell from my shoulders…I found thatthe world was, after all, full of delightful damned souls…’ As soon as Uncle Tomfound out he got rid of Archibald Douglas, but it was too late.Crowley's next achievement was to seduce the parlourmaid on his mother's bed. Heexplains that the girl ‘took it into her head to better herself by getting astranglehold on the young master’. On Sunday morning he made an excuse to stayaway from the prayer meeting, ‘got the girl into my mother's bedroom and made mymagical affirmation’. For some reason, the girl decided to tell on him.Confronted by Uncle Tom, Crowley denied everything, and hit upon an ingeniousmethod of allaying his uncle's suspicions. Pressed to reveal where he had beenwhen the girl alleged they were together, Crowley pretended to be nervous andworried, then finally confessed that he had been buying tobacco. He had alreadytaken the precaution of getting the tobacconist to back up his story. Crowleyshed tears and pleaded that he had been led astray by bad companions, and feltdoubly triumphant at having got the better of both his uncle and theparlourmaid.In his book on Crowley, Israel Regardie argues that Crowley had incestuousfeelings towards his mother, and that the consummation on her bed proves that hewanted to violate her. This seems to be an unnecessarily Freudian interpretationof Crowley's perfectly straightforward sexual obsession. Sex itself became forhim another way of cocking a snook at authority, and if he could combine it withan act of defiance, the pleasure became ten times as great. The key tounderstanding Crowley is the same as the key to understanding the Marquis deSade. Both wasted an immense amount of energy screaming defiance at theauthority they resented so much, and lacked the insight to see that they wereshaking their fists at an abstraction.The problem with this kind of anti-authoritarianism is that it has the effect oftainting sex with violence and vice versa. The two become associated as gesturesof revolt, and it is difficult thereafter to separate them. ‘My sexual life wasvery intense. My relations with women were entirely satisfactory. They gave methe maximum of bodily enjoyment and at the same time symbolized my theologicalnotions of sin. Love was a challenge to Christianity. It was a degradation and adamnation…’ But he still insists that, sexually speaking, he is perfectlynormal, quite free of ‘morbid sexual symptoms’, which he regards as a symptom ofself-division. But, having explained his theory at some length (‘The completeman, harmonized, flows freely towards his natural goal’), he then goes on torelate how, at the age of fourteen, he decided to kill a cat to see whether itreally had nine lives. ‘I therefore caught a cat, and having administered alarge dose of arsenic, I chloroformed it, hanged it above the gas jet, stabbedit, cut its throat, smashed its skull and, when it had been pretty thoroughlyburnt, drowned it and threw it out of the window that the fall might remove itsninth life…I remember that all the time I was genuinely sorry for the animal; Isimply forced myself to carry out the experiment in the interest of purescience.’ But it is obviously unlikely that even the stupidest fourteen year oldcould really believe that it is impossible to kill a cat except with ninedifferent forms of violence applied simultaneously; the incident merelyillustrates a form of moral imbecility to which Crowley had become prone throughsheer hatred of authority.The anti-authoritarianism developed further when, at the age of sixteen, he wassent to Malvern public school, which he found as ‘brutal and imbecile’ as theprevious one at Cambridge. ‘The prefects were hulking louts, shirking both workand play, and concentrating on obscenity and petty tyranny.’ And when one ofthem sought the housemaster's permission to flog Crowley for ‘some minor breachof discipline’, he found Crowley already there, pouring out his own accusations.‘I got my licking’, Crowley reports gleefully, ‘but there was a fine series ofexpulsions to balance it.’ Then, aware that what he has just admitted places himin a thoroughly bad light, he hastens to add: ‘Of course, my action wastechnically indefensible; but after all, I had held my tongue uncomplaininglyfor months and it was only when they appealed to the housemaster to fight theirbattles that I appealed to him to fight mine.’ Crowley is an expert atself-justification; but it takes very little penetration to see through thisone—that when he says ‘technically indefensible’ he means ‘morallyindefensible’, but deliberately chooses the less accurate word, and that when hesays ‘they’ appealed to the housemaster he is trying to gloss over the fact thatonly one prefect was concerned, and that he chose to inform on them all.The orgy of tale-telling presumably made him unpopular, and this may have beenwhy he persuaded his mother to take him away from Malvern, which he did withcharacteristic duplicity. ‘I…drew such a picture of the abominations which wenton, though I knew nothing about them or even what they were, that my motherrefused to let me go back. I told her…that if Mr Huntingdon [the housemaster]knew what was going on in the house, it would break his heart.’ She decided tosend him to another public school, Tonbridge, and he records complacently: ‘Ihad developed a kind of natural aristocracy. People were already beginning to beafraid of me.’Yet here we encounter the essence of the strange paradox that was AleisterCrowley. In page after page of the Confessions he emerges as a liar, a sneak, abully and a hypocrite; we can understand what Regardie meant when he spoke of‘the nasty, petty, vicious louse that occasionally he was on the level ofpractical human relationships.’ Yet a few pages later, dealing with thesuggestion that Crowley was a schizophrene (he means a psychopath), Regardiesays: ‘I do not believe that a schizophrene is capable of the tremendousself-discipline and mental training that Crowley embarked upon.’ It would beinaccurate to characterize Crowley as a schizophrene (employing the word in itsusual incorrect sense of split-personality) because the split in Crowley was notin the area of the personality. Personality is the aspect of us that copes withthe world around us. But the aspect that becomes absorbed in ideas or in work orin beauty is a kind of impersonality. Impersonality is what Socrates andMichelangelo and Beethoven and Einstein have in common. As a personality,Crowley was inclined to take moral shortcuts; yet another aspect of him couldbecome totally absorbed in work and self-discipline. He loved to be alone, andit is characteristic that his original title for his Confessions was The Spiritof Solitude (which he borrowed from Shelley). He writes:The problem of life was not how to satanise, as Huysmans would have called it;it was simply to escape from oppressors and to enjoy the world without anyinterference of spiritual life of any sort. My happiest moments were when I wasalone on the mountains; but there is no evidence that this pleasure in any wayderived from mysticism. The beauty of form and colour, the physical exhilarationof exercise, and the mental stimulation of finding one's way in difficultcountry, formed the sole elements of my rapture.[And he adds an interesting piece of self-revelation:]So far as I indulged in daydreams, they were exclusively of a normal sexualtype. There was no need to create phantasms of a perverse or unrealizablesatisfaction. It is important to emphasise this point, because I have alwaysappeared to my contemporaries as a very extraordinary individual obsessed byfantastic passions. But such were not in any way natural to me. The moment thepressure was relieved every touch of the abnormal was shed off instantly. Theimpulse to write poetry disappeared almost completely at such periods…It is an interesting thought that a Crowley who had been brought up in anon-repressive atmosphere might never have experienced the slightest desire towrite poetry, perform ritual magic, or acquire himself the reputation of ‘thewickedest man in the world.’ On the other hand, he might well have made his markas an explorer, a scholar or a scientist. As it was, the oversexed schoolboycontinued his single-minded pursuit of sin and depravity, and was forced toleave Tonbridge when he caught gonorrhoea from a Glasgow prostitute. His motherfelt that he again required the supervision of a Plymouth Brother, and sent himto lodge with one at Eastbourne. He began to attend Eastbourne College and,unexpectedly, discovered an enthusiasm for science. This event—in some ways oneof the most important of his life—is dismissed in the Confessions in twosentences: ‘During the day I worked at Eastbourne College in the chemicallaboratory under Professor Hughes, and was privileged to assist the great man inseveral researches which go to prove that no two substances can combine in theabsence of a third. It seems strange that I should have seen the bearings ofthis upon philosophy.’ References to science and mathematics can be foundscattered throughout his work, emphasising that they remained lifelonginterests. The science writer J.W.N. Sullivan is one of the dedicatees of theConfessions, and it is typical that although he seduced Sullivan's wife, Crowleyalways placed a high value on his friendship.It was also during the Eastbourne period that Crowley taught himself to playchess and soon discovered that he was the best player in the town. Thechess-playing mentality requires the same combination of intuition and logic asthe scientist and mathematician; on the other hand, few of the great chessmasters have shown remarkable artistic ability. Crowley's powers as a chessplayer, as well as his natural ability to learn languages, reveal that his castof mind was objective and scientific rather than artistic. Under differentcircumstances, he would have made an excellent engineer or city planner.But the urge to cast off his Christian background had become a neuroticobsession that dominated his life. When his chemistry professor at Eastbournedenounced the Bible, ‘it almost took my breath away to hear a man in authorityspeak so openly.’ It never struck Crowley that it might be possible to dismissChristianity as superstitious nonsense, and then get on with more importantthings. Crowley's sense of guilt was so strong that defiance of religion had tobe a moral crusade. Shaw once remarked of Wagner's obsession with incest that itwas all very well, but what sensible person wanted to sleep with his sister?Crowley would have been incapable of this kind of detachment. He records that,on his first stolen visit to the theatre, he looked around at the audience andwondered: ‘Aren't all these people afraid of being found out?’ So instead oftrying to make use of his natural talent for science or languages, he continuedto look around for a career that would ‘shock the bourgeoisie’ and outrage theirmoral standards.Writing poetry seemed a step in the right direction. At Malvern he had written apoem in honour of Florence Maybrick, sentenced to death (later commuted to lifeimprisonment) for poisoning her husband, who objected to her affair with acertain Mr Brierly.Poor lady! whom a wicked jury's hateIn face of facts as iron as the graveTo which they would have doomed thee – bitter fate!Thee guiltless to the cruel hangman gave.Crowley admitted that his sympathy for Mrs Maybrick ‘nowise argues my belief inher innocence. She was admittedly an adulteress. I asked no further questions.The mere fact thrilled me to the marrow. Adultery being the summit ofwickedness, its commision excused everything.’The earliest influence on Crowley's poetry was Swinburne:Are the roses dead to-day?Is the wine spilt? Is the fluteBroken? Is thy lover fled?Has the dancer danced away?Is the voice of ocean mute?Is the hour of dreamland dead?Nay, the slumbers of thine headShall be until thy lures,Love shall gird thee as a garmentwhile thy very life endures.But it can be seen that he lacks Swinburne's natural talent for verbal music;his poetry never seems to flow freely for more than a line or two. Then he seemsto get himself tangled up in language:Ere the grape of joy is goldenWith the summer and the sunEre the maidens unbeholdenGather one by one,To the vineyard comes the shower,No sweet rain to fresh the flower,But the thunder rain that cleaves,Rends and ruins tender leaves.‘Fresh the flower’ sounds awkward, and the last three lines have to be readseveral times to grasp their meaning.Even in the nature poetry, where there is a more obvious sincerity, there isthis same odd clumsiness:Blind the iron pinnacles edge the twilight;Blind and black the gills of the mountain clefted,Crag and snow-clad slope in a distant visionRise as before me.At the age of twenty, Crowley was trying to build a career on a completemisconception of his natural talents. This was, in fact, the year he went up toCambridge. The Eastbourne period had ended in an unusually violent eruption. Helived with his tutor's family, and sympathised strongly with the middledaughter, a ‘beautiful, voluptuous and normal’ girl who was engaged to anequally normal young man. But the family insisted that they could only marry oncondition he became a Plymouth Brother. When the young man decided against it,he was thrown out of the house, and the girl was subjected to continuous abuseand ill-treatment. ‘Meals were a poisoned whirlwind…’ ‘One morning at breakfastI said about a millionth part of what I thought and the family startedscreaming. It was as if they had been attacked by a collective mania. Everythingwas thrown at me; they went for me with claws and fists. They were too blindwith rage to know what they were doing. I simply knocked their heads togetherand walked out of the house. When I thought the atmosphere had had time todissipate I returned with the intention of carrying out a rescue for thedistressed damsel. They were too much scared to oppose me, and I begged her tocome away at once and go to her ex-fiancé's family. But she could not summon upcourage to do it…later in the afternoon my Uncle Tom, summoned by telegram, cameto fetch me away from the accursed spot…’Crowley's language, as on so many other occasions, obscures what actuallyhappened. Did they physically attack him? Did he physically attack them? At allevents, it seems to have confirmed Crowley's feeling that people were afraid ofhim. ‘The incident had a wholesome effect upon my own family. They had failed tobreak my spirit and begun to realize that I had reached the stage when I couldmake as much trouble for them as they could for me. The best thing they could dowas to let me go my own way. I had won the fight; and the evidence was my seasonin the Bernese Oberland on my own responsibility. I was recalled by telegram.They had decided to let me go to Trinity.’It was the beginning of a new epoch in his life. ‘I had the sensation of drawinga long deep breath as one does after swimming under water…’ He was intoxicatedwith freedom, and took advantage of it to read all kinds of books he had neverbeen allowed to read—Carlyle, Swift, Coleridge, Fielding, Gibbon—and to have asmany sexual liaisons as possible.’…at Cambridge I discovered that I was of anintensely passionate nature, physiologically speaking. My poetic instincts,further, transformed the most sordid liaisons into romance, so that theimpossibility of contracting a suitable and serious relation did not worry me.’There was no prostitution in Cambridge, ‘but nearly all the younger women of thedistrict are eager to co-operate in the proper spirit.’ Even so, he found thetime he had to devote to pursuing them a continual irritation. He records in theautobiography that he resents the system that makes it necessary to waste somuch time pursuing something that ought to be delivered with the milk. And whileCrowley found women necessary to satisfy his physical needs, he found themunsatisfying as human beings. ‘Intellectually…they did not exist. Even the fewwhose minds were not completely blank had them furnished with Wardour StreetChippendale. Their attainments were those of the ape and the parrot. These factsdid not deter me. On the contrary, it was highly convenient that one's sexualrelations should be with an animal…’ Crowley was devoid of the element ofprotectiveness on which most successful male-female partnerships are based, soit is unsurprising that most of his longterm sexual relationships ended indisaster.He decided to enter the diplomatic service because ‘it seemed to afford thegreatest opportunities for worldly enjoyment.’ The court that appealed to himmost was that of Imperial Russia, and he went to St Petersburg in the longvacation of 1897. It was on his way back from Russia that he attended a chesscongress in Berlin, and suddenly decided that he no longer wanted to be worldchampion. Watching these shabby nonentities ‘I perceived with preternaturallucidity that I had not alighted on this planet with the object of playingchess.’But what had he alighted on it for? On the last day of the previous year, he hadhad a strange mystical experience in Stockholm that seemd to give him a glimpseof his way forward:I was awakened to the knowledge that I possessed a magical means of becomingconscious of and satisfying a part of my nature which had up to that momentconcealed itself from me. It was an experience of horror and pain, combined witha certain ghostly terror, yet at the same time it was the key to the purest andholiest spiritual ecstasy that exists. At the time, I was not aware of thesupreme importance of the matter. It seemed to me little more than a developmentof certain magical processes with which I was already familiar…It is obvious that Crowley is quite determined to speak in riddles. In The GreatBeast, Symonds suggests that ‘he had an illumination that he could controlreality by magical thinking.’ If so, why did he not say so? When Crowley isreticent in the Confessions, it is usually on account of the censor (forexample, he fails to mention that he left Tonbridge school because he caughtgonorrhoea). Moreover, the comment that it seemed to be a ‘development ofcertain magical processes already known to me’ also seems to afford a clue, forin 1896, when he was only twenty-one, Crowley still knew nothing aboutmagic—that only came about two years later, when he met an alchemist calledJulian Baker. The only ‘magic’ he refers to in the Confessions before that dateis sex magic, as, for example, when he says that he made his ‘magicalaffirmation’ with the parlour maid on his mother's bed. We should also take noteof the words ‘I possessed a magical means of becoming conscious of andsatisfying a part of my nature which had up to that moment concealed itself fromme.’ What part of his nature had so far concealed itself from him? The obviousanswer is surely: his homosexuality. So far, Crowley's sexuality had been, as henever tires of emphasising, completely normal—so that he remarks about his earlyperiod at Cambridge: ‘My skill in avoiding corporal punishment and my lack ofopportunity for inflicting it had saved me from developing the sadistic ormasochistic sides to my character.’ It therefore seems probable that therevelation that came to Crowley in Stockholm was of his homosexual tendencies,or perhaps his inherent masochism and the possibility of satisfying it bybecoming the passive partner in acts of sodomy.Symonds’ mistake probably arises from the fact that Crowley says that therevelation took place at midnight on 31 December 1896, and that he was‘awakened’ to the magical knowledge; it sounds as if Crowley woke up from sleep.But 31 December is New Year's Eve, and it is more likely that Crowley wasenjoying the New Year's Eve celebrations when some homosexual encounter made himaware of this element in his own nature.This matter is connected with another curious minor mystery about Crowley'sdevelopment. 1895, the year he went up to Cambridge, was also the year of thetrial of Oscar Wilde. Wilde and Crowley had a great deal in common; in fact,Wilde's attitude to sin and to Christian morality is so close to Crowley's ownthat Crowley often sounds as if he is echoing Wilde. We know that Crowley wasswept off his feet by the poetry of Swinburne; it seems unbelievable that he wasnot equally enraptured by Wilde's Sphinx and Picture of Dorian Grey. Yet theonly lengthy passage about Wilde in the Confessions takes a patronising tone,and implies that Wilde became a homosexual simply as a method of getting to know‘the right people’ at Oxford. This negative attitude towards a man Crowley mighthave been expected to admire wholeheartedly arouses the inevitable suspicionthat Crowley was influenced by Wilde, but for some reason preferred not toacknowledge it. The last thing he wanted was to be labelled a kind ofimitation-Oscar. And this, in turn, gives rise to another suspicion: thatCrowley's homosexual experiment may have been inspired by Wilde, and by acertain romanticism about the ‘love that dare not speak its name.’ This, at allevents, is a suspicion that seems consistent with the facts.In 1897, the year he went to Russia, Crowley experienced another ‘dark night ofthe soul’ that was to profoundly affect his whole mental outlook. It was duringan illness, a few months after his return from St Petersburg, that he wentthrough a period of deep depression, during which he found himself ‘forced tomeditate upon the fact of mortality.’ ‘I was appalled by the futility of allhuman endeavour.’ Suddenly, all life seemed pointless. What if he becameEngland's ambassador to Paris? His name would be forgotten in a hundred years.What if he became a great poet? He was in one of England's two greatuniversities, yet hardly anyone knew anything about Aeschylus. Suppose he becamea Homer or Shakespeare, a Caesar or Napoleon: what would it all matter when theearth finally disappeared?Instead of concluding that this gloomy view was simply the outcome of illnessand too many hangovers, Crowley allowed himself to be convinced that he wascontemplating some profound universal truth—in fact, the first of the Buddha'sfour noble truths: the recognition that life is nothing but suffering. This ledhim to decide: ‘I must find a material in which to work which is immune from theforces of change.’ ‘Brain and body were valueless except as instruments of thesoul’. ‘The ordinary materialist usually fails to recognize that only spiritualaffairs count for anything, even in the grossest concerns of life…Materialwelfare is only important as assisting men towards a consciousness ofsatisfaction.’ This is obviously a profoundly important recognition, and revealsthat, for all his faults, Crowley was capable of thinking his way through toimportant insights. The businessman strives for wealth as if wealth in itselfcould provide a means of satisfaction; other men strive for fame, for power, forsexual conquest, for the same reason. But most of these things turn out to becuriously disappointing. This is because our real aim is to achieve power overthe mind itself, and without this power, all ‘achievement’ is futile.But having achieved this important insight, which sounds like the beginning ofwisdom, Crowley proceeded to subject it to his own peculiarly twisted logic.‘From the nature of things, therefore, life is a sacrament; in other words, allour acts are magical acts. Our spiritual consciousness acts through the will andits instruments upon material objects, in order to produce changes which willresult in the establishment of the new conditions of consciousness which wewish. That is the definition of Magick.’ (Crowley preferred to spell it with a‘k’ to distinguish it from the common use of ‘magic’.) He then goes on to admit:But I was so far from perceiving that every act is magical, whether one likes itor not, that I supposed the escape from matter to involve a definite invasion ofthe spiritual world. Indeed, I was so far from understanding that matter was inits nature secondary and symbolic, that my principal preoccupation was to obtainfirst-hand sensory evidence of spiritual beings. In other words, I wanted toevoke the denizens of other planes to visible and audible appearance.But which denizens? For Crowley, there were two sides: angels and devils:On the Christian hypothesis the reality of evil makes the devil equal to God.[And if I had to take sides, then] it was not difficult to make up my mind. Theforces of good were those which had constantly oppressed me. I saw them dailydestroying the happiness of my fellow men. Since, therefore it was my businessto experience the spiritual world, my first step must be to get into personalcommunication with the devil.In order to understand this Alice in Wonderland logic, which will strike mostpeople as unintentionally funny, we have to grasp that Crowley had suffered somuch from religious idiots that the very word ‘goodness’ aroused a Pavlovianreaction of fury. He possessed a powerful, logical mind; it should have beeneasy enough to see that real goodness is another name for human decency, and hasnothing to do with religious bigotry. But while his mother and Uncle Tom were,figuratively speaking, breathing down his neck, he was unable to exercise normallogic. So, like some latter-day Faust, Crowley decided that the correct responseto his Vision of Universal Suffering was to try and raise demons. He went to thenearest bookseller and asked for a work on ritual magic. He was handed acompilation called The Book of Black Magic and Pacts by A. E. Waite, a member ofthe Golden Dawn. Crowley found this thoroughly disappointing; it seemed to befull of spells for preventing a huntsman from killing game or bewitching aneighbour's cows. This was not the real stuff of diabolism, as revealed inHuysmans’ novel Là-Bas, with its Black Masses and sexual orgies. But a passagein the book seemed to hint that Waite knew of some Hidden Church which preservedthe mysteries of true initiation. Crowley wrote to Waite, who replied with aletter advising him to read a book called The Cloud upon the Sanctuary by Karlvon Eckartshausen, an eighteenth century German mystic who wrote about preciselysuch a secret religious order. Crowley read it again and again, and becameobsessed by the idea of reaching this secret order:The sublimity of the idea enthralled me; it satisfied my craving for romance andpoetry. I determined with my whole heart to make myself worthy to attract thenotice of this mysterious brotherhood. I yearned passionately for illumination.I could imagine nothing more exquisite than to enter into communion with theseholy men and to acquire the power of communicating with the angelic and divineintelligence of the universe.All this was at least a little more satisfying than the Celtic Church, a curiouscommunion of which he had become a member, and which ‘moved in an atmosphere offairies, seal women and magical operations’. The Celtic Church had made Crowleydream of going in quest of the Holy Grail; while membership of another movement,the Spanish Legitimists (which wished to place Don Carlos on the throne ofSpain) led him to dream of becoming a man of action; but Don Carlos changed hismind and the conspiracy collapsed. Crowley was in a state of spiritual flux,possessed by contradictory yearnings to become a member of a secret order ofsaints and a devil worshipper.Mountain climbing continued to obsess him; he was an excellent climber, who hadtaught himself by scrambling up Cumberland fells and Beachy Head, then began tospend every holiday in the Alps or Bernese Oberland. He found an opportunity toexpress some of his innate inclination to hero worship when he met anexperienced mountaineer called Oscar Eckenstein in the Lake District. Eckensteinwas a scientist, and he set out to teach Crowley all about the techniques ofclimbing; it seems clear that he became the father figure Crowley had seensearching for ever since the death of his father.A completely different kind of friendship sprang up between Crowley and a femaleimpersonator named Herbert Pollitt, ten years Crowley's senior, who came toCambridge to take part in the Footlights revue. Pollitt had long, pale-goldhair, and tragic eyes, and ‘his outlook on life was desperate.’ Crowley admitsthat ‘the relation between us was that ideal intimacy which the Greeksconsidered the greatest glory of manhood’, but then deliberately sets out tomislead when he adds that the English connect such ideas with physical passion.There can be little doubt that the relationship with Pollitt was Crowley's firstfully-fledged homosexual affair. Pollitt was a friend of Aubrey Beardsley, andintroduced Crowley to the work of other ‘decadent’ writers and artists. (This iswhy it seems incomprehensible that Crowley makes no mention of having readWilde.) ‘In his heart was a hunger for beauty which I can only call hideous andcruel, because it was so hopeless.’ But Pollitt felt that Crowley's ‘spiritualaspirations’—the yearning to join some secret brotherhood—were futile andpointless, and Crowley finally decided to break with him. In spite of his owntendency to pessimism, there was an instinct for health in Crowley that led himto turn his back on the feeble and the defeated.Nevertheless, the twenty-two-year-old Crowley was a thoroughly mixed-up youngman, a poor little rich boy, a snob who was not quite certain of his own socialposition, an incorrigible exhibitionist who was unsure of his own identity, abully with a craving to be loved, a diabolist with a paradoxical desire to be asaint. The autobiography, written in his fifties, still reveals a festering ego,brooding on the humiliations of more than thirty years ago, and descending to asilly kind of abuse that suggests that his mental age is still that of anadolescent:[A.E. Waite] is not only the most ponderously platitudinous and priggishlyprosaic of pretentiously pompous pork butchers of the language, but the mostvoluminously voluble. I cannot dig over the dreary deserts of his drivel insearch of the passage which made me write to him…He devotes a full page to reviling the English Alpine Club, insisting that itwas ‘bitterly opposed to mountaineering—its members were incompetent, insanelyjealous of their vested interest and unthinkably unsportsmanlike.’ The reasonfor this abuse, it emerges, is that the Club had turned down his own admissionfor membership. Why? Because ‘the record of climbs I put in for admission wasmuch too good.’ And we have to read between the lines, and call upon ourknowledge of Crowley's character, to realise that they must have found himintolerably cocky and boastful. If Crowley had been alive half a centuryearlier, we might suspect that he was the model for Flashman in Tom Brown'sSchooldays.But the boastful exhibitionist also had a genuine desire to find some cause towhich he could devote his life. Literature seemed to be the obvious choice—sincehis poetry flowed freely and naturally—but even here he could not make up hismind where the poet ended and the poseur began. John Symonds began the originaledition of The Great Beast with this quotation from Crowley's first publishedpoem Aceldama, which is an apt illustration of the problem:It was a windy night, that memorable seventh night of December, when thisphilosophy was born in me. How the grave old professor wondered at my ravings! Ihad called at his house, for he was a valued friend of mine, and I felt strangethoughts and emotions shake within me. Ah! how I raved! I called on him totrample me, he would not. We passed together into the stormy night I was onhorseback, how I galloped round him in my phrensy, till he became the prey ofreal physical fear! How I shrieked out I know not what strange words! And thepoor good old man tried all he could to calm me; he thought I was mad! The fool!I was in the death struggle with self; God and Satan fought for my soul thosethree long hours. God conquered—now I have only one doubt left—which of thetwain was God?Even the title of the poem (Aceldama was the field bought with Judas's thirtypieces of silver) brings to mind W.S. Gilbert's parody of Swinburne fromPatience:Oh! to be wafted awayFrom this black Aceldama of sorrow,Where the earth of a dusty todayIs the dust of an earthy tomorrow!In the Confessions Crowley writes: ‘But in Aceldama…I attained, at a bound, thesummit of Parnassus. In a sense, I have never written anything better.’ Butwhen, in 1910, he issued a selection of his poems ‘in response to awidely-spread lack of interest in my writings…’ he took care not to includeanything from Aceldama. It is, in fact, a typical Crowleyan rhapsody to sin,whoredom and degradation.Aceldama was the first of a series of poems and dramas that he printed at hisown expense; in 1898 alone he published, in addition to Aceldama: The Tale ofArchais, Songs of the Spirit, The Poem, Jephthah, Jezebel and White Stains. Thelast is a collection of obscene poems which professes to be the literary remainsof a ‘neuropath of the Second Empire.’ In the Confessions he claims, typically,that the book proves his’ essential spirituality.. and preternatural innocence.’He explains that he had been reading Krafft-Ebing's Psychopathia Sexualis, anddisagreed that sexual perversions are the result of disease. They are, aysCrowley, ‘merely magical affirmations of perfectly intelligible points of view’.Crowley thought that since his pervert ended in madness and murder, he hadwritten a highly moral book that was suitable for Sunday schools.But poetry can be an unsatisfactory means of expression, particularly when noone buys it or reads it. Crowley was still obsessed with thoughts of magic. AtWastdale Head, he had ‘appealed with the whole force of my will to the adepts ofthe Hidden Church to prepare me as a postulant for that august company. As willbe seen later, acts of will, performed by the proper person, never fall to theground…’ This seemed to have no immediate effect. But he continued to read‘occult’ texts in a desultory kind of way, struggling through Knorr vonRosenroth's Kabbalah Unveiled, translated by S.L. MacGregor Mathers, and throughvarious works on alchemy. In Zermatt in 1898, he found himself among a group ofEnglishmen in a beer hall, and began to ‘lay down the law on alchemy.’ ‘I trustI impressed the group of men with my vast learning.’ But one of the party provedto be a real alchemist—a chemist named Julian L. Baker. He walked back withCrowley to his hotel, and revealed that he himself had succeeded in ‘fixing’mercury—turning the liquid into a solid. Crowley was immediately convinced thatthis was the Master for whom he had sent out his SOS signal the previous Easterat Wastdale. But the next day, Baker had left the hotel. Frantically, Crowleytelegraphed all over the valley, and finally caught up with Baker ten milesbelow Zermatt. ‘I told him of my search for the Secret Sanctuary of the Saintsand convinced him of my desperate earnestness. He hinted that he knew of anAssembly which might be that for which I was looking.’Back in London, Baker met Crowley, and introduced him to a man whom he describedas ‘much more of a Magician than I am.’ This man proved to be George CecilJones, an analytical chemist who looked like Jesus Christ, and who had a fieryand unstable temper. It was Jones who finally told Crowley about the HermeticOrder of the Golden Dawn, founded ten years earlier, and introduced him toMacGregor Mathers. Crowley paid his ten shillings membership fee, and onNovember 18, 1898, attended the Mark Masons’ Hall in Great Queen Street and wasgiven the magical name Perdurabo (I will endure), then he went through thesolemn, if rather absurd, magical ceremony that made him a member of the GoldenDawn. His SOS had been answered."},{"pageContent":"ThreeRaising HellTHE CHIEF of the Golden Dawn, Samuel Liddell Mathers, was quite as extraordinarya character as Crowley himself. The poet Yeats, who met Mathers in the BritishMuseum Reading Room around the beginning of the 1890s, noticed:…a man of thirty-six or thirty-seven, in a brown velveteen coat, with a gauntresolute face and an athletic body, who seemed…to be a figure of romance…Ibelieve that his mind in those early days did not belie his face and body—thoughin later years it became unhinged as Don Quixote's was unhinged—for he kept aproud head amid great poverty. One that boxed with him nightly has told me thatfor many weeks he could knock him down, though Mathers was the stronger man, andonly knew long after that during those weeks Mathers starved.It would be possible for a hostile biographer to see Mathers as almost a figureof fun. Born in Hackney, East London, in 1854, Mathers was the son of a clerk,and became a clerk himself when he left school. He joined the Hampshire InfantryVolunteers in his twenties, and there is a photograph of him in lieutenant'suniform. But he does not figure in the regiment's list of officers, so we mustassume that he was a private or, at most, an NCO. The officer's rank seems to bea sign of his extremely active fantasy life, like the titles ‘MacGregor ofGlenstrae’ and ‘Count of Glenstrae’ that he later awarded himself. At the age oftwenty-three he became a Mason; it was through the Masons that he met the Londoncoroner Dr Wynn Westcott, and Dr William Woodman, who introduced him to theEnglish branch of the Rosicrucians. Mathers became their protegé, and theycommissioned him to translate The Kabbalah Unveiled. Then the famous ‘cyphermanuscripts’ turned up—according to the most popular version, on a second-handbookstall in the Farringdon Road—and the Golden Dawn was founded. In theprevious year, 1887, Mathers had met a beautiful French art student in theBritish Museum, Moina Bergson, sister of the philosopher, and eventuallypersuaded her to marry him and share his poverty. She had strong psychic gifts,and Mathers used her as a ‘seeress’. By now, Mathers was calling himself‘MacGregor’ and allowing it to be understood that he was the chief of the clan.He liked to be photographed in highland regalia.It sounds then, as if he was an incorrigible fantasist, a dreamer who found thedull reality of his life as Samuel Mathers, underpaid clerk, impossible to bear,and who promoted himself to the rank which he felt to be more in accord with hisnobility of spirit. But this would undoubtedly be a mistake. Whatever hispretensions, his ‘magical powers’ were real enough. Mathers handed Yeats various‘tattwa symbols’ (yellow squares, blue discs, red triangles, etc), and whenYeats pressed them against his forehead, he began to see images that he couldnot control: a desert, with a black giant rising up among ancient ruins. Matherstold him he had seen a being of the order of the salamanders—fireelementals—because he had used the fire symbol. Yeats was at first inclined tothink that these odd tricks were the result of imagination or telepathy, untilconstant experience convinced him that the symbols actually conjured up theappropriate image, and that when he accidentally gave someone the wrong symbol,it still conjured up the correct image. The same symbol—a star—evoked in onesubject a vision of a rough stone house with the skull of a horse in it, and inanother, a rough stone house with a golden skeleton it it. The similarity wastoo great to be accidental. At another session with Mathers and his wife, allthree participated in lengthy hallucinations, Yeats seeing in brief flashes whatMrs Mathers was describing, and often seeing things before she described them.Even if these visions were merely form of imagination, it still seems obviousthat some peculiar power was at work. So whether or not we can accept that thesephenomena were ‘magical’ or merely psychological, there can be no doubt thatMathers had stumbled on some interesting secrets, and that he was not a fraud inthe ordinary sense of the word.What seems altogether more dubious is his apparently sincere belief that he wasin touch with ‘Secret Masters.’ In 1892, Mathers became convinced that he hadcontacted these Masters, and that this confirmed his position as head of theGolden Dawn. In a manifesto issued four years later, Mathers declared that theSecret Chiefs were human and living on earth, but possessed of terriblesuperhuman powers. He claimed that contact with these chiefs was a frighteningexperience:I can only compare it to the continued effect of that usually experiencedmomentarily by any person close to whom a flash of lightning passes during aviolent storm; coupled with a difficulty in respiration similar to thehalf-strangling effect produced by ether.We are naturally inclined to dismiss this kind of thing as pure imagination,that is, a deliberate lie. But before doing so, it is important to bear in mindthat this ‘occult tradition’ of secret masters is not a modern invention, datingfrom Madame Blavatsky. It is genuinely a part of an ancient tradition, and itcan be found in many religions of the world. The composer Cyril Scott expressedits essence when he wrote in An Outline of Modern Occultism (1935):Firstly, the occultist holds that Man is in process of evolving from comparativeimperfection to much higher states of physical and spiritual evolution.Secondly, that the evolutionary process in all its phases is directed by a GreatHierarchy of Intelligences who have themselves reached these higher states.One of the best modern expositions of this notion is to be found in The Peopleof the Secret by Edward Campbell (writing under the pseudonym Ernest Scott), whostarts from the notion of a ‘Hidden Directorate’, referred to in Sufictradition; Campbell identifies this directorate with a concept to be found inThe Dramatic Universe by J.G. Bennett, a follower of Gurdjieff: of ‘a class ofcosmic essences called Demiurges that is responsible for maintaining theuniversal order.’ The People of the Secret is an interpretation of westernhistory in terms of this notion: of deliberate intervention in human history bythese ‘Demiurgic Intelligences’. He sees the concept of these Intelligences aspart of an occult tradition that can be traced from the Sufis, which enteredEurope through the Arab invasion of Spain, and which also finds expression inthe Tarot, the Kabbalah and alchemy.It should be mentioned at this point that the Hebrew ‘magical’ system known asthe Kabbalah is the foundation stone of western occultism. Its basic notion isthat there are ten levels of reality, of which the one on which we live—theearthly plane—is the lowest. A kind of magical tree, the tree of life, connectsthese planes, rather like the beanstalk in the fairy tale. But they must also beseen as inner worlds, or planes of consciousness, which man can explore if hehas enough mental discipline.This ‘exploration’ has much in common with a technique devised by Carl Jung,which he called ‘active imagination.’ At a period of mental crisis before theFirst World War, Jung discovered that he could enter into states which might bedescribed as waking dreams, and in these states, he held conversations withbeings he was convinced were real, that is, who existed independently of his ownmind. Jung's belief that there are realms of the mind that are common to usall—like some inner country—is closely related to the ideas of the Kabbalists.It may also be significant that Jung came to feel that alchemical texts offer akind of symbolic guide to these inner realms.It is possible to see then, that although Mathers sounds like a self-deceivingcrank, he was actually working within a well-established tradition, and wasconvinced that he had simply been fortunate enough (with the help of the SecretChiefs) to gain access to an ancient knowledge system virtually forgotten bywestern man. He believed that he had been influenced and guided by the Chiefsfrom an early point in his life.So we may regard Mathers as an extremely fascinating psychological case, aromantic dreamer who wove around himself an extraordinarily complete web ofself-delusion. Or we may regard him as a remarkable ‘outsider’, like so many ofthe great poets and artists of the nineteenth century, who chose to walk his ownlonely path, sustained by a certainty that came from ‘inner vision.’ This is theway that Crowley saw him when he met him in 1898. At the time of the meeting,Mathers had been living in Paris for the past six years. He was partly supportedby another Golden Dawn member, Annie Horniman—the tea heiress—but eventuallyquarrelled with her, and suspended her membership. So life in Paris was aspoverty-stricken as in London. And it was hard to maintain his authority as headof the Golden Dawn from Paris. (Mathers was the sort of person to whommaintaining his authority was of major importance.) So when Crowley, with hiscapacity for hero-worship and his craving for father-figures, presented himselfin Paris, Mathers immediately accepted him as a friend and ally. They had muchin common: both were egoists; both were proud and dictatorial; both wereinclined to make a fetish of physical fitness and athleticism; both were snobs,and liked to fantasize about belonging to the aristocracy. When Crowley turnedon his Libran charm, he was hard to resist. Mathers was completely won over.Other members of the Golden Dawn were less enthusiastic. To the romantic Yeats,Crowley must have seemed insufferably bouncy and conceited. Crowley thoughtYeat's work ‘lacked virility.’ When he called on Yeats, he took with him theproofs of his play Jephthah, of which the following is a typical extract:Oh the time of dule and teen!Oh the dove the hawk has snared!Would to God we had not been,We, who see our maiden queen,Love has slain whom hate has spared.Yeats probably thought it was derivative rubbish, but was too polite to say so.‘He forced himself to utter a few polite conventionalities.’ But Crowley felt hecould see through to the ‘black, bilious rage that shook him to the soul’,because he instantly recognized Crowley's incomparable superiority as a poet.Crowley adds charitably that he saw this as proof that Yeats was a genuine poet,because no charlatan would have felt such fear of a greater poet than himself…Meanwhile, Crowley had taken himself a flat in Chancery Lane, and dedicated amirror-lined room as a temple for white magic. There was also a black temple,whose altar was supported by a statue of a negro standing on his hands. It alsocontained a skeleton, which Crowley ‘fed’ with blood, and to which he sacrificedsmall birds—the idea being to give it life. Crowley shared the flat with anotherGolden Dawn member named Alan Bennett, one of the few members who took a likingto him. Bennett seems to have been a man of extremely strong personality, and heintroduced himself to Crowley by looking into his eyes and saying in almostmenacing tones: ‘Little brother, you have been meddling with the Goetia’ (blackmagic). When Crowley denied it, Bennett said: ‘Then the Goetia has been meddlingwith you. ‘In fact, Crowley was convinced that Yeats was trying to put a spellon him, out of jealousy of his poetry, so he was much impressed. As he got toknow Bennett better, he must also have been impressed by his way of life.Bennett suffered from asthma, to alleviate which he took opium; then, after amonth, he would find himself becoming accustomed to it, and instead ofincreasing the dose, would switch to morphine, then to cocaine, then tochloroform. When he was weak enough, the asthma would go away, and return as hebecame stronger. He seems to have had a Swiftian loathing for human physicalfunctions, including sex and childbirth. Crowley became deeply attached to him.By now, Crowley was calling himself Count Vladimir Svareff, and no doubtspeaking with an appropriate Russian accent. He explains in the Confessions thatit was a psychological experiment, to see how people would treat a Russiannobleman. In fact, he was probably influenced by Mathers—‘MacGregor ofGlenstrae’—and by his own incorrigible egoism.But the desire to be a magician was undoubtedly genuine. In his Chancery Lanetemple, he was practising the magic of Abra-Melin the Mage, a forgotten magicianMathers had discovered in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, and translatedinto English. Abra-Melin's rituals differ markedly from those of othergrimoires, for example, the Key of Solomon or Sword of Moses, with their solemninvocation of demons—all performed from within a magic circle; by comparison,Abra-Melin is quiet and almost mystical in tone, and the invocations sound likeprayers. No magic circle or pentacle is required—merely a ‘holy place, such asan altar constructed in a wood. For six months, the magician must ‘inflamehimself with prayer’. If he is successful, his Holy Guardian Angel will manifesthimself, and he will instruct the magician in good and evil spirits.Crowley began practising Abra-Melin magic in his Chancery Lane temple, with thehelp of Bennett and his friend Jones. And he seems to have obtained almostimmediate results. There is no need to disbelieve him when he says ‘during thistime, magical phenomena were of constant occurrence’, although we may suspectthat all Crowley was doing was to involve himself in some form of ‘spiritualism’not unlike table-turning or playing with an Ouija board. Anyone who sits aroundin the dark, trying to invoke spirits for long enough, will probably obtain someunusual results. The classic experiment—performed many years after Crowley'sdeath—was devised by the Toronto Society for Psychical Research, who decided to‘conjure up’ a spirit they had invented themselves, an English nobleman calledPhilip who had committed suicide after his mistress was burned as a witch. Aftera while, raps sounded from a table, and the entity identified itself—by means ofa code—as Philip, and told his life story in some detail. Later on, the‘possessed’ table appeared on television and walked up on to the platform byrocking back and forth up the steps. The Toronto group was convinced that theyhad proved that ‘spirits’ are the creation of the unconscious mind; but anequally plausible hypothesis is that they succeeded in invoking the kind ofdubious entity that often manifests at seances.1 [part0007.html#fnr1]At all events, Crowley found that ‘demons’ came unsought, and that semi-solidshadows were appearing on the stairs. He locked the temple door before leavingfor dinner with Jones; when he came back, it was open, and the furniture hadbeen disarranged and symbols flung on the floor—typical poltergeist activity.Crowley and Jones decided that Bennett would die unless he could be sent to awarmer climate. The problem was that Bennett was Crowley's teacher, and Crowleyfelt strongly that it is a violation of the laws of magic to accept money. Heand Jones invoked the spirit Buer, the healer of the sick, and he claims thatthey saw a helmeted head and a solid left leg, although the rest was cloudy. Theoperation had to be accounted a failure.Then Crowley had an idea. He was having a love affair with the wife of acolonel—Crowley rejected the idea that the aspiring magician must be strictlychaste—and had been trying to get rid of her. The woman begged Crowley to seeher at her hotel. Crowley went, and told her he would offer her the opportunityof doing a completely unselfish act—to give him a hundred pounds for a friend.She handed over the money, and Bennett was able to sail for Ceylon, where hebecame a Buddhist monk. John Symonds makes the not implausible suggestion thatthe real reason Crowley decided not to give Bennett the money himself was thathe was less rich than he pretended to be, and was running through hisinheritance at an alarming speed.It was obvious that London was no place to carry out the full ritual prescribedby Abra-Melin the Mage—to begin with, it takes six months to complete. Crowleyrequired a house with a door opening to the north, outside which there had to bea terrace that he could cover with fine river sand, and a ‘lodge’ where thespirits could congregate. He searched throughout most of 1899, and finally foundwhat he wanted on the southern shore of Loch Ness, near Foyers—it was calledBoleskine House, and its owner was willing to rent it. Crowley decided to followMathers’ practice and award himself a title: he called himself the Laird ofBoleskine and Abertarff, and purchased the appropriate tartan. Then FraterPerdurabo—the magical name given him by the Golden Dawn—began preparing thetalismans he would need for the Abra-Melin ritual. The immediate result was astrange shadow that made it necessary to use artificial light, even on thebrightest day. After that, the house ‘became peopled with shadowy shapes’, and afriend who had come to stay with him was suddenly seized with panic, and leftwithout saying goodbye. Then, as mentioned earlier in this book, his coachmanbecame an alcoholic, his housekeeper vanished, and a workman went mad and triedto kill Crowley. Still the Laird persisted with his invocations, and practisedkabbalistic techniques of astral travel, seeing visions of fire angels, earthspirits and other elementals.But Crowley was not the kind of person to persist in fasting, prayer andmeditation for six months—not to mention abstinence from sex. He became boredwith trying to ‘uplift the standard of Sacrifice and Sorrow’, and began to broodvengefully on his fellow magicians of the Golden Dawn. They were definitelyhostile. Mathers had initiated Crowley into a higher grade in Paris, and theyfelt it should have been done in consultation with the London Lodge. So whenCrowley applied for the documents to which he believed he was entitled, he wasrefused. Julian Baker admitted that he thought Mathers was behaving badly. Theactress Florence Farr, who was nominally in charge of the London group, feltthat she could no longer be Mather's representative and sent him a letteroffering her resignation. Mathers scented defiance, and sent her an angry letterin the course of which he denounced Wynn Westcott, the original founder of theGolden Dawn, and accused him of forging the original ‘Sprengel’ documents. Thismeant that, in effect, the London Lodge was based on a lie. But this did notapply to the Paris Lodge, for Mathers himself had been in contact with theSecret Chiefs since 1892, and had founded a ‘Second Order’ under theirdirection. All this aroused rage and consternation in London.Crowley immediately wrote to Mathers, offering his full support, and his fortuneas well. Then he rushed off to Paris, where he had no difficulty persuadingMathers to appoint him his representative in dealing with the London Lodge.Crowley had no doubt that Mathers had every right to be as high-handed as hepleased. He writes typically: ‘My own attitude was unhampered by any ethicalconsiderations…Ordinary morality is only for ordinary people.’ The London‘rebels’ deserved to be squashed like beetles. (Crowley also seems to have takenthe colonel's wife with him on this trip to Paris, as a reward for givingBennett the £100.) Then he hurried back to London, chortling at the idea ofgetting his own back on the people who had snubbed him. His chief task was tointerrogate all the ‘rebels’ and force them to sign a pledge of loyalty toMathers. His immediate purpose was to seize the temple—or vault—in which memberswere initiated into the Second Order (it was supposed to be a replica of thevault in which the body of the legendary Christian Rosenkreuz, founder of theRosicrucians, had been found in 1604). Crowley engaged a chucker-out from a pubin Leicester Square, then went, together with his latest mistress, ElaineSimpson, to the rooms in Blythe Road, Hammersmith. The lady who was there sent afrantic telegram to another Golden Dawn member named Hunter; he and FlorenceFarr arrived to find Crowley asserting that he was now in possession of thevault. A constable was sent for, who persuaded Crowley to leave. The next day,he was back wearing Highland dress, with a black mask over his face and a daggerat his side. This time, Yeats was there with Hunter, and refused Crowleyadmittance. Again a policeman was sent for, and again Crowley and his mistresswere ordered to leave. The chucker-out finally arrived—having got lost enroute—too late to support Crowley. In a letter to Lady Gregory, Yeats explainedthat they had been forced to throw Mathers out of the Order, after he had sentone ‘Crowley, a quite unspeakable person’, to try to seize the headquarters. Heexplained that they had refured to admit Crowley into the Second Order ‘becausewe did not think a mystical society was intended to be a reformatory.’Next Crowley tried the law, but the case was dismissed, and Crowley had to paycosts. Crowley went back to Paris to report to Mathers, and declaredtriumphantly that ‘the rebel camp’ had broken up in anarchy. Crowley wrote inthe Confessions: ‘They issued various hysterical manifestos, distinguished byconfusion of thought, inaccuracy of statement, personal malice, empty bombastand ignorance of English.’ To justify the latter jibe he quotes the rebels assaying ‘nothing shall effect our connection’, and explains condescendingly: ‘Thepoor dears meant affect.’ It can be seen that Crowley was not yet ready toundertake six months of purification and prayer.The Abra-Melin ritual has to be started after Easter, and since Crowley had amonth or so to spare, he decided to leave the scene of past humiliations and goabroad. At Mathers’ home he met two Golden Dawn members who had just returnedfrom Mexico. They made it sound an interesting place; so he sailed for New York.By the time he reached there, Easter was behind him, and another chance ofmeeting his Holy Guardian Angel had been lost.After three days of sweating in a heat wave, Crowley took a train to MexicoCity. At first he loathed the place—it seemed totally inefficient, and it wasalmost impossible to find anything appetising to eat or drink. But when he hadrented a house overlooking the Alameda park, and hired an Indian girl to providefor his domestic and sexual needs, he began to like the laissez faire attitudeof the Mexicans. He obtained an introduction to a local magical order, presidedover by an old man called Don Jesus Medina, who was sufficiently impressed byCrowley's knowledge of the Kabbalah to initiate him through all its thirty-threegrades in a matter of weeks. Crowley also established his own magical order, theLamp of the Invisible Light, and initiated Don Jesus. His Ritual of SelfInitiation involved ‘the working up of spiritual enthusiasm by means of amagical dance’ which induced giddiness. Crowley claimed:I used to set my will against the tendency to giddiness and thus postpone aslong as possible the final physical intoxication. In this way I lostconsciousness at a moment when I was wholly absorbed in aspiration. Thus,instead of falling into a dull darkness, I emerged into a lucid state, in whichI was purged of personality and all sensory or intellectual impressions. Ibecame the vehicle of the divine forces invoked, and so experienced Godhead.But he admits that his results did not aid his personal progress ‘since I hadnot formulated any intellectual link between the divine and humanconsciousness.’All this makes it clear that, in spite of his instability of character, Crowleyhad a genuinely deep interest in magic. Sixty years later, he would haveundoubtedly been an enthusiastic experimenter with psychedelic drugs. As it was,he was fascinated by other means of ‘altering consciousness.’ He had learnedenough from Mathers to know how to produce certain strange effects, and heindulged himself with enthusiasm. He claimed to have learned the trick of makinghimself invisible, although it was only partially successful, and his physicalimage in a mirror became blurry and faint instead of disappearing. But he wasconvinced that the real secret of invisibility is a form of telepathy whichsomehow prevents other people from noticing you. (The playwright Strindberg heldthe same belief.) ‘For example, I was able to take a walk in the street in agolden crown and a scarlet robe without attracting attention.’Even Crowley was aware that his real problem was that he lacked the personaldedication necessary to be a true magician—that is, an explorer of the outerlimits of consciousness. ‘I felt instinctively that my pious predecessors werewrong in demanding the suppression of manhood…’ His solution was to wear overhis heart ‘a certain jewelled ornament of gold’ (presumably amagically-consecrated talisman) whose purpose was to prevent him from thinkingthoughts that might hinder his magical operations. When he took it off, he wasallowed to think, and do, whatever he liked. It turned him, he admits, into akind of Jekyll and Hyde. He was rather in the position of a person who wished tobecome a Catholic priest while at the same time keeping several mistresses. Itnever seems to have struck him that there was a fundamental self-deceptioninvolved.Symonds has a penetrating comment about Crowley at this period of his life, andit goes to the heart of Crowley's personality problem:He needed some strong or horrific experience to get ‘turned on.’ Most people are‘turned on’ by sitting at home with a book, listening to music, or looking at apainting. Crowley needed his Mexican whore with the worn face before he couldwrite his verses about Tannhauser. In this sense, then, I say that he lackedimagination. As the course of his life shows, he went to great lengths to bestimulated; he could never get enough of fantastic adventures; the messagedidn't come through otherwise.The result is that Crowley's life produces on most readers the effect of anendless breathless gabble like a recorded tape accelerated to several times itsproper speed. The effect of the next four or five chapters of his Confessions iscertainly that of a vertiginous travelogue. Eckenstein arrived in Mexico, andthey went mountaineering together, climbing Popacatapetl at a gallop, with anunhappy newspaper reporter—who had expressed his doubts about their climbingabilities—hitched between them. He went through Texas, which he found barbarousand horribly commercial. He travelled from San Francisco to Hawaii, and onWaikiki beach met a married woman with whom he had a love affair, celebrated ina sequence of poems called Alice, An Adultery. In spite of its title, itcontains some moving love poetry. And a long poem called The Argonauts is themost ambitious he ever attempted, ‘a lyric poem in which everything in the worldshould be celebrated in detail.’ He admits that it was inspired by the Americanpassion for tall buildings and vast processions. It contains some of Crowley'sbest verse:I hear the waters faint and farAnd look to where the Polar Star,Half hidden in the haze, dividesThe double chanting of the tides;But, where the harbour's gloomy mouthWelcomes the stranger to the south,The water shakes, and all the seaGrows silver suddenly.It may sound more like Robert Service than Swinburne or Wilde, but it has anirresistable forward rhythm.Crowley paused in Hong Kong to renew acquaintance with the mistress who hadhelped him defy the London rebels, but was shocked to find that she had used hermagical robes to win first prize at a fancy dress ball. Disillusioned, he wenton to Ceylon via Singapore and Penang. In Colombo, he found Alan Bennett sittingat the feet of a Hindu guru, to whom Crowley took an instant dislike. Hepersuaded Bennett to leave with him for the healthier climate of Kandy, where herented a bungalow. And here, at last, he was to settle down to the study of asubject to which he could respond with wholehearted enthusiasm: yoga, which hedefined as ‘a scientific system for attaining a definite psychological state.’The problem with magic was that Crowley was never quite free of the desire toattain his own ends and, in this respect, his ‘guru’ Mathers set a thoroughlybad example. But Alan Bennett—‘the noblest and gentlest soul I have everknown’—was a different matter. Towards Bennett, Crowley felt none of thatpersistent rivalry that characterised his relationship with other males (andmade it practically impossible for him to maintain a friendship). So for thenext few weeks he studied the techniques of yoga under Bennett's instructionsand, according to his own account, succeeded in attaining the first state oftrance, known as Dhyana, a state in which the percipient and the perceived havebecome one. Crowley had another motive for persisting in his yogic studies—hebelieved it could be used ‘to produce genius at will.’ The chapter in which hedescribes these ideas (twenty-nine) is one of the most interesting in TheConfessions, and demonstrates clearly that, whatever his faults as a humanbeing, Crowley was undoubtedly no fraud as a student of techniques fortransforming consciousness.By this time, Bennett had made up his mind to become a Buddhist monk. He andCrowley took leave of one another, and Crowley went on to India, where heintended to join Eckenstein for an attempt to climb K2, also known as Chogo-Ri.He hated Calcutta as much as Texas, and his comments about it reveal that hecontinued to regard himself as a simple-souled idealist:My cynical disgust with the corrupt pettiness of humanity, far from beingassuaged by the consciousness of my ability to outmanoeuvre it, saddened me. Iloved mankind; I wanted everybody to be an enthusiastic aspirant to theabsolute. I expected everyone to be as sensitive about honour as I was myself.My disillusionment drove me more and more to determine that the only thing worthdoing was to save humanity from its own ignorant heartlessness.But apart from his disillusionment with the crowds in the cities, the cravingfor adventure was stirring again. Bennett was in a monastery on the south coastof Burma, and Crowley heard that the journey across the Arakan hills was‘reputedly so deadly that it has only been accomplished by very few men.’ He anda companion sailed for Rangoon, then took a steamer up the Irrawaddy River toMindon. But when the headman told him that the coolies refused to go because thejourney was too dangerous, he and his companion hired a dugout canoe and wentdownriver. Crowley was in a fever from malaria, and felt that the jungle wasspeaking to him of the world beyond material manifestations, and sleeping undera tree, he felt himself embraced by its elemental spirit—‘a woman vigorous andintense’—who kept him awake all night in ‘a continuous sublimity of love.’ Asthey continued downstrean, the nature mystic spent the day shooting at everybird he saw. A duck that seemed unkillable so enraged him that he insisted ongoing ashore to stalk it; his shot missed and it flew downstream. Then the birdmade the mistake of flying overhead, and Crowley shot it from below so that itfell with a flop into the river. The episode reveals that manic persistence thatmade him such a bad enemy.He eventually located Bennett in his monastery, and spent some time therewriting a sequel to Jezebel. He also wrote an invocation to Hecate, the goddessof the underworld, and claims that when he recited it, the goddess appeared tohim in the form of Bhavani, the Hindu goddess who wears a necklace of skulls. Hesays the vision made him aware of the basic identity of all religions. Afterthis, he sailed for India, where he wrote an essay called ‘Crowleymas Day’,explaining that the universe is basically Nothing; he adds modestly that it maybe regarded as a fair sample of his genius.In Delhi, in March 1902, he joined Eckenstein and four other climbers for theassault on Chogo-Ri; this is the world's second highest mountain, less than athousand feet lower than Everest. (Crowley would no doubt have preferred toattempt Everest, but it was then forbidden to Europeans.) It was a riskyventure, for Chogo-Ri was generally regarded as unclimbable. Crowley devotesmore than fifty pages of the Confessions to describing the expedition, and thereader soon senses that he regarded it as far more than a mountaineeringchallenge. Crowley's lifelong problem was a failure to feel himself a fullyfledged member of the adult community; the doctrinaire religion of his childhoodhad left him with a kind of permanent inferiority complex. This was the realpurpose behind his travels, his adulteries, his persistent attempts to outragethe bourgeoisie: he was trying to escape his old personality, to shed it as asnake sheds its skin. The world's second highest mountain was a symbol ofachievement. The conqueror of Chogo-Ri would become an international celebrity,and his sense of his own value would be permanently secure.Regrettably, the attempt was a failure. The party began the ascent on 8 June1902, and eight days later, they were at the foot of the glacier that led upinto the mountain. The sheer size and majesty of the peak overwhelmed them.Crowley began to suffer from snow blindness and exhaustion, to counteract whichhe drank champagne. Before they could begin the final ascent, the weather broke.And although two other members of the expedition finally reached a point twohundred feet beyond that of any previous expedition, the mountain finally drovethem back. One of the party began to suffer hallucinations and had to be sentback. The man who accompanied him stole the emergency rations. As Crowley lay inhis tent, suffering from malaria and listening to the howling of the storm, aninstinct told him that the weather had broken for good. In any case, they wereexhausted. So, with the storm still raging, they packed and retreated down themountain. Two months after they had set out, they were again down on the plain.In mountaineering terms it was Crowley's first recorded defeat. And in personalterms, it might also be regarded as the point at which Crowley's life began totake a downward turn.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0007.html#fn1]. See Conjuring up Philip, An Adventure in Psychokinesis byIris M. Owen and Margaret Sparrow. Fitz Henry and Whiteside, Toronto."},{"pageContent":"FourThe Chosen of the GodsIT WAS winter when Crowley arrived back in Paris. He stayed at the apartment ofa Cambridge friend, Gerald Kelly, who admired Crowley's poetry, and who haddecided to become a painter. (He ended up as a president of the Royal Academy.)In a restaurant called Le Chat Blanc, where Kelly dined every evening, he madethe acquaintance of a young novelist named Somerset Maugham, who took an instantdislike to him, but who, five years later, used Crowley as the central characterin a novel called The Magician. This is how he descibes him:[Oliver Haddo] was a man of great size, two or three inches more than six feethigh; but the most noticable thing about him was a vast obesity. His paunch wasof imposing dimensions. His face was large and fleshy…And in his preface to the novel, Maugham notes:In early youth, I was told, he was extremely handsome, but when I knew him hehad put on weight and his hair was thinning. He had fine eyes and a way…of sofocusing them that, when he looked at you, he seemed to look behind you. He wasa fake, but not entirely a fake. At Cambridge he had won his chess blue and wasesteemed the best whist player of his time. He was a liar and unbecominglyboastful, but the odd thing was that he has actually done some of the things heboasted of.Maugham also tells how, many years later, Crowley sent him a telegram saying:‘Please send twenty-five pounds. Mother of God [Crowley's latest ‘scarletwoman’] and I are starving.’ Maugham, who was notorious for his meanness,ignored it.Inevitably, Crowley hastened to call on Mathers. But the autobiography is oddlyreticent about what occurred, except to record that Mathers failed to return abag and a fifty guinea dressing case that Crowley had left with him before heset out on his round-the-world voyage—the impecunious Mathers had obviouslypawned them. Symonds is probably not far from the truth when he suggests thatCrowley was hoping to be received as an equal, and looking forward to showingoff his newly acquired knowledge of yoga and Buddhism, while Mathers was not inthe least interested in talking to ‘equals.’ Two such outsized egos were boundto clash sooner or later.In the Confessions there follows one of those typically weird stories thatleaves the reader baffled and irritated; moreover, Crowley quotes it in thewords of his first biographer, Captain J.F.C. Fuller, as if to avoid theresponsibility for personally vouching for its truth. Kelly is alleged to havetold Crowley that a girl of his acquaintance—he calls her Miss Q—had fallen intothe power of a ‘vampire.’ Crowley was asked to tea with Miss Q and the vampire—amiddle aged lady he calls Mrs M. Left alone with her, he sat by the fire lookingat a bust of Balzac. An odd dreamy feeling began to steal over him, andsomething ‘soothing and lecherous’ moved across his hand; the vampire wasbending over him and touching his hand with the tips of her fingers. Moreover,she had been transformed into a twenty-year old girl ‘of bewitching beauty.’Recognizing that he was almost in her power Crowley casually replaced the buston the shelf and began making small talk. Suddenly, the woman leapt at him andtried to kiss him; Crowley held her at arm's length and re-directed her own evilcurrent back against her. The fair skin wrinkled; the flaxen hair turned thecolour of muddy snow, and the vampire, now a hag of sixty, hobbled from theroom.But there were stranger things to come. Crowley was convinced that the vampirewas a puppet in the hands of far stronger masters. Kelly's girlfriend happenedto be a powerful clairvoyant, and she obligingly went into a trance, anddescribed a house which Crowley recognized as that of Mathers. But theinhabitants were not Mathers and his wife Moina, but a sinister pair called Mrand Mrs Horos, two dubious ‘messiahs’ who had been sentenced to long terms inprison the previous year. Now it dawned on Crowley why Mathers showed nogratitude to his former disciple. His body had been taken over by the evil MrsHoros, while Moina was possessed by the husband, who was at present servingfifteen years for multiple rape. And as Crowley agonised about whether to try tosave Mathers, the clairvoyant warned him to leave things as they were…This is the kind of story that makes the reader suspect that Crowley wasbasically a total fraud. In The Great Beast, Symonds tells many such storieswithout any kind of commentary, and so produces the overall impression that thebook is written tongue-in-cheek.Now the truth is that, although Crowley was capable of outrageous invention, histales were—as Maugham points out—usually based on fact. We have to remember that‘magick’ is basically the development of a ‘psychic faculty’ which enables aperson to see below the surface of the normal reality. If pressed to be quitespecific, Crowley would probably have admitted that he ‘saw’ Mrs M transformedinto a twenty-year old girl in the same sense that he ‘saw’ the Hindu goddessBhavani when he recited his invocation to Hecate: that is, he saw it with his‘mind's eye.’ We should also understand that when he speaks of vampires, he isnot speaking of the bloodsucking variety described by Bram Stoker. It isundoubtedly true that some people have the power to drain others of vitalenergy; we have all encountered those irritating people who seem to leave usabsolutely exhausted. Crowley would have described these as unconsciousvampires. He also implies that there are certain people who can exercise thesame power consciously, like Mrs M.Now it so happens that, where Mr and Mrs Horos were concerned, Crowley was notentirely wide of the mark. Their story is one of the strangest in the annals ofpsychical research, and is worth retelling briefly here. The ‘evil’ Mrs Horoswas actually a rather talented American adventuress named Editha Salomon, whoclaimed to be the illegitimate daughter of Lola Montez and Ludwig the Second ofBavaria. She had been described as a Madame Blavatsky without the intellect, andshe certainly seems to have been a woman of commanding personality andconsiderable charm. Like Madame Blavatsky, she was probably a mixture oftrickster and genuine clairvoyant. Like many mediums, she was a vast woman,whose eyes were totally compelling. Her career, like that of Madame Blavatsky,had many ups and downs, including a couple of brief periods in jail. In 1897,when she was forty-eight, she met a man fifteen years her junior, Frank DuttonJackson, a failed priest, and the two married and went into partnership in themessiah business. Their disciples (sceptics said their dupes) adored them. Butwould-be messiahs always arouse hostility, and the Horoses, as they calledthemselves, were often driven to move on. To do them justice it must be saidthat even if they did have more than a touch of charlatanism, they were oftentreated with undue harshness by the authorities. In New Orleans, for example,the police could find nothing worse to charge them with than being ‘dangerousand suspicious characters.’ Later, charged with fortune telling, they weresentenced to thirty days in jail.Early in 1900, the Horoses arrived on Mathers’ doorstep in Paris; they had takena large furnished flat, and said they had come to help him with his movement.Mathers was greatly impressed by the knowledge of magic shown by Mrs Horos, andsince Mathers was himself a considerable scholar, we may conclude that Mrs Horoswas not entirely a fraud. Mathers later told Yeats:She is probably the most powerful medium living…At times she has been controlledby very great and high forces, but much more frequently by evil spirits.She had convinced him of her genuineness by relating to him details of a privateconversation he had had with Madame Blavatsky. And he believed he had spoken toFräulein Anna Sprengel (the original founder of the Golden Dawn) through hermediumship. But when the Horoses left Paris, for Cape Town, they took with themsome Golden Dawn rituals and books on magic that Mathers had lent them, whichled the paranoid Mathers to decide they were common swindlers.One year later they reappeared in London and set up a magical movement whichthey called The Order of the Golden Dawn the Outer, presumably making use of the‘stolen’ rituals. They also rented a house at 99 Gower Street (where theSpectator later had its offices), and announced the formation of The College ofLife and Occult Sciences, whose subjects included ‘mental and magnetictherapeutics, psychology, clairvoyance, clairaudience, mediumship, materialism,thaumaturgic power and Divine Healing.’ They had various teachers and healers onthe staff, and gave courses of lectures at a reasonable fee of from six totwelve shillings a course.They were also—as the subsequent court case made clear—practitioners of someform of tantrism or sex magic. They had inserted in various newspapersadvertisements in which ‘an educated, attractive foreign gentlemen’ wanted tomeet a lady with a view to matrimony. Many applied, and the Horoses selected,among others, three attractive girls called Vera Croysdale, Olga Rowson andLaura Faulkner. Olga Rowson—a twenty-six year old housemaid—was to tell how sheanswered the advertisement, and was taken out to tea by the dapper andattractive Theo Horos, who flattered her and tried to fondle her. Back at thehouse, she felt ‘quite helpless’, and allowed herself to be persuaded into bedwith Mr and Mrs Horos (the latter posed as his mother), where she yielded up herperson. But, like the other female neophytes, she seems to have had no regrets,and formed a strong attachment to the Horoses. So did sixteen year old DaisyAdams, who had accompanied the Horoses to London from Birkenhead (where they hadstayed with her mother), and who seems to have lost her virginity in a peculiarmanner, probably through the ritual use of a phallic object. But the loss ofvirginity was—it became clear in the court case—all part of the initiationritual, as in certain modern witchcraft cults. Vera Croysdale and Laura Faulknertold similar stories.It was Vera Croysdale who set the machinery of justice in motion by complainingthat the Horoses had borrowed money and jewellery from her and seemed to have nointention of returning it. Two detectives called at Gower Street to makeenquiries. What they saw there made them persistent, and they questioned thegirls, who innocently divulged that they regularly took part in sexual rites.The Horoses scented danger and fled back to stay with Daisy's mother inBirkenhead, where they were tracked down and arrested.The case caused a sensation. The Horoses seem to have had no real sense of theirdanger. After all, they were able to produce letters in court in which the girlstestified to their warm affection for the Horoses. Although Horos was accused ofrape, there can be no doubt that he was technically innocent; the girls were allperfectly willing, both before and after. The Horoses were shattered andincredulous when they were found guilty. Horos was sentenced to fifteen years inprison, Mrs Horos to seven. It was undoubtedly a major miscarriage of justice;the Horoses were really being imprisoned for immorality. And Crowley, who mighthave been expected to be on their side, was totally unsympathetic. He states inthe Confessions that Mrs Horos had ‘bolted with such property of [Mathers] asshe could lay her hands on’ (which was untrue), then goes on primly: ‘In thefollowing year she was sentenced to seven years penal servitude for outrages onyoung girls. She had in some way used the rituals of the Order which she hadstolen from Mathers to entice them to their doom.’ And in due course Crowley wasable to combine his distaste for the Horoses with his resentment of Mathers inhis extraordinary tale about Mathers being ‘possessed’ by the spirit of MadameHoros. It is another illustration of the ‘nasty, petty, vicious louse’ aspect ofCrowley of which Regardie speaks. Confined in the Female Convict Prison inAylesbury, Editha Horos was in no position to ‘possess’ anyone.In the Confessions, Crowley himself shows some awareness of the deterioration ofhis character at the time, writing:…my spiritual state was in reality very enfeebled. I am beginning to suspectmyself of swelled head with all its cohort of ills. I'm afraid I thought myselfrather a little lion on the strength of my journey, and the big people in theartistic world in France accepted me quite naturally as a colleague.By ‘the artistic world’ Crowley means Auguste Rodin, who was impressed by asonnet Crowley wrote about his controversial bust of Balzac, and who invitedCrowley to come and stay at Meudon ‘to give a poetic interpretation of all hismasterpieces.’ The result was Rodin in Rime, which contains such lines as:The veil o’ th’ mist of the quiet wood is lifted to the seer's gaze; He burnsathwart the murky maze beyond into beatitude.Crowley published the book privately and, well pleased with himself, returned toLondon. Reading between the lines of the Confessions, it looks as if he may havedecided to leave Paris to escape from an artist's model to whom he had allowedhimself to become engaged ‘out of sheer lack of moral energy.’ Then, stillsuffering from moral lassitude, he returned to Scotland. Boleskine, hediscovered, had acquired a bad reputation in his absence, and locals refused topass the house after dark, preferring to make long detours. Crowley plunged intoboredom. He tried to dispel it with one of his juvenile practical jokes, writingto a society for the suppression of vice in London to complain that prostitutionwas unpleasanly conspicuous in the neighbourhood. The society sent aninvestigator, and in due course reported to Crowley that he could find no signof vice in Foyers; Crowley replied on a postcard: ‘Conspicuous by its absence,you fools!’Still bored, he went to Edinburgh to look for a companion-housekeeper, and founda suitable woman whom he calls ‘Red-headed Arabella.’ But she was not able tocome immediately. So when Gerald Kelly wrote from Strathpeffer suggesting thatCrowley should join him, Crowley accepted with relief. Kelly's sister Rose wasalso present. She was a woman of some experience, which must have appealed toCrowley, who had no use for innocent virgins. She had been married and widowed,and had scandalised her family by subsequently getting engaged to two men at thesame time and having an affair with a married man; to extract money from herfamily, she told them she was pregnant, and they gave her forty pounds for anabortion, which she spent on dresses. The family retaliated by putting pressureon her to marry one of the suitors. Rose felt herself thoroughly ill-done-by,and poured out her heart to Crowley. It aroused his ‘Shelleyan indignation’, andhe immediately proposed to rescue her by offering her his name in matrimony. Hisintentions were not romantic; he explained that after the marriage, they couldseparate, and she need never see him again. But it would prevent her family fromforcing her into marriage. Rose was delighted with the idea. The next morningthey fled by train to Dingwall, found themselves a lawyer, and were marriedbefore breakfast. At that moment, Gerald Kelly burst into the office and, onlearning that they were already married, tried unsuccessfully to hit Crowley.When he calmed down, it was decided that Rose should return to Strathpeffer andCrowley should go back to Boleskine, which is what he had intended anyway. (Headds complacently: ‘I have frequently noticed that interference with my plansensures their being carried out with exactitude.’)Partly to silence local scandal, Rose and he decided that they would take atrain to some remote hotel together and pretend to be on honeymoon. The journeywas passed in embarrassed silence; Crowley was feeling trapped, and wasuncharacteristically at a loss for words. Unable to face the clerk at the hotel,he left Rose to register while he went off to contemplate the sea and brood onsuicide; when he returned, he found that she had unsportingly booked a doubleroom instead of two singles. It began to dawn on him that she was in love withhim, overcome by his generosity in trying to save her. It would have been a pityto turn down a girl who was willing to give herself to him. ‘I was willing topropitiate physiology…’ So he did. And the next morning, he arrived at theastonishing conclusion that he was also in love. From then on, ‘the honeymoonwas uninterrupted beatitude.’ Rose turned out to be exactly what he wanted: arather masochistic female who liked to be dominated:Once, in the first three weeks or so, Rose took some trifling liberty; Irecognised the symptoms and turned her up and spanked her. She henceforth addedthe qualities of a perfect wife to those of a perfect mistress. Women, like allmoral inferiors, behave well only when treated with firmness…All the same, ‘love filled the universe; there was no room for anything else.’They went on to Paris, where they met Moina Mathers on a bridge; Crowley insiststhat she had become a prostitute, but this sounds unlikely. After that, theywent on to Cairo where, to impress his wife, Crowley suggested spending a nightin the King's Chamber of the Great Pyramid. Servants escorted them to the footof the Grand Gallery; then they went on alone. In the King's Chamber, Crowleylit a candle, and began to read the preliminary invocation of the Goetia. Soonhe realised that it was not necessary to peer at the page at close quarters; thechamber was full of a pale lilac glow—the ‘astral light.’ Crowley put out thecandle and read on by the magical glow. Then they composed themselves to sleepon the hard floor, and spent an uncomfortable night. When they woke up, thelight had vanished.After this, they sailed for Ceylon, and Crowley noted with satisfaction thatRose fascinated every man who met her, ‘a Helen of Troy or a Cleopatra.’ Hewrote a series of love poems to her, Rosa Mundi, and felt relieved that hispoetic genius was returning (he was afraid that domestic happiness had stifledit forever). He also tramped around the jungle, blasting off at anything thatmoved and leaving a trail of slaughtered birds and animals behind. On the shoresof a lake, he decided to shoot enough furry bats to make himself a waistcoat.His first shot filled the air with flapping wings. But one of the bats landed onRose, and he had some trouble detaching its claws. That night, he was awakenedby the noise of a squealing bat. When he looked up he saw Rose, completelynaked, clinging with her arms and legs to the wooden frame that supported themosquito net. When he pulled her down, she bit and spat and squealed; Crowleyhad to shake her awake. ‘It was the finest case of obsession that I had ever hadthe good fortune to observe.’When Rose discovered she was pregnant, they decided it was time to turn theirfootsteps towards home. In Cairo, Crowley decided to change his identity yetagain. He admits this with some embarrassment in the Confessions, blaming ‘theintoxicated infatuation of my hymeneal happiness’ for his decision to ‘play apuerile part on the world's stage.’ Lord Boleskine (as he had been callinghimself since his marriage) proceeded to don Persian garb and pretend to be anoriental prince, Chioi Khan, ‘being Hebrew for the Beast’. (It is at this pointin the autobiography that Crowley informs us that his mother believed he was theBeast—number 666—in Apocalypse; this sounds like one of his spontaneousinventions.) Crowley also wrote to Rose's parents informing them that in futureall correspondence must be addressed to ‘Princess Chioi Khan’, and when MrsKelly added an exclamation mark after the title, Crowley returned her letterunopened.Now, at last, Crowley returned to the study of magic; a ‘sheik’ who taught himArabic also—‘on discovering that I was an initiate’—provided him with books andmanuscripts on the Arabic Cabbala, and taught him how to eat live scorpions,lick a red hot sword, and run a stiletto through his cheek without drawingblood.Chapter forty-nine of the Confessions begins: ‘This chapter is the climax ofthis book.’ He also regarded it as the climax of his life. It describes how hereceived the curious ‘scripture’ known as The Book of the Law.The Crowleys took a flat in Cairo, and Crowley tried to conjure up sylphs(spirits of the air) by repeating the invocation that had produced such anextraordinary effect in the Great Pyramid. Rose failed to see them, but sankinto a curious state of mind in which she kept on repeating: ‘You have offendedHorus’, which puzzled Crowley, since her knowledge of Egyptian mythology wasalmost non-existent. He was baffled and rather annoyed when she proceeded totell him how to invoke Horus, by methods that struck him as ‘pure rubbish.’ Butwhen she took him into the Boulak Museum next door, and showed him a stelecontaining the image of Horus, in a form known as Ra-Hoor-Khuit, he began to beconvinced. It began to look as if the Secret Chiefs of the Golden Dawn weretrying to contact him—presumably with a view to making him their intermediaryinstead of Mathers. On 19 March, 1904, at midnight, he made the invocationaccording to his wife's instructions (he was now calling her Ouarda the Seeress)and was told through her that ‘the equinox of the gods had come, that a newepoch in human history had begun, and that he was to form a link betweensolar-spiritual forces and mankind.’ In other words, Crowley had been chosen asthe new Messiah.Rose told him that the messages came from an entity who identified himself asAiwas, Crowley's Holy Guardian Angel—the spirit Crowley had been trying toinvoke with the unfinished ritual of Abra-Melin the Mage. Now Aiwas told Crowley(through Rose) that he was to go into his workroom at precisely midday on 8, 9and 10 April and to write down what he heard for the next hour. What Crowleyheard, or so he claims, was a ‘musical and expressive’ voice dictating a messagefor mankind. The message began, somewhat obscurely: ‘Had! The manifestation ofNuit.’ According to Crowley, this meant ‘Motion, the manifestation of matter.’It went on: ‘The unveiling of the company of heaven. Every man and woman is astar. Every number is infinite; there is no difference.’ ‘Every man and woman isa star’ means, according to Crowley, that every man and woman is unique andremarkable, while ‘Every number is infinite’ means that every individual is theUltimate God. But this spirit of tolerance towards all mankind is contradictedby much of the text that follows, which is élitist—in fact, Nietzschean, intone. ‘These are dead, these fellows; they feel not. We are not for the poor andsad: the lords of the earth are our kinsfolk…Beauty and strength, leapinglaughter and delicious languor, force and fire, are of us.’ It sounds like anextract from Thus Spake Zarathustra, except for the Swinburnian phrase aboutdelicious languor.Crowley argues that The Book of the Law supplants all previous religions, andthat, unlike other holy scriptures, it contains the proofs of its ownauthenticity within itself. This is a claim that is impossible to takeseriously. Passage after passage sounds exactly like the Crowley of The Tale ofArchais and Rosa Mundi:I am the blue-lidded daughter of Sunset; I am the naked brilliance of thevoluptuous night-sky. To me! To me! Thou art exhaust in the voluptuous fullnessof the inspiration; the expiration is sweeter than death, more rapid andlaughterful than a caress of Hell's own worm. I am in secret fourfold word, theblasphemy against all gods of men. Curse them! Curse them! Curse them! With myHawk's head I peck at the eyes of Jesus as he hangs upon the cross…Let Maryinviolate be torn upon wheels: for her sake let all chaste women be despisedamong you!Bahlasti! Omnedha! I spit on your crapulous creeds.All this sounds too much Crowley in his best Marquis de Sade vein to be acceptedas a communication from an extraterrestrial intelligence. In a comment addedlater, Crowley makes the ‘priest of the princes Ankh-f-n-Khonsu’ declare thatthe study of this book is forbidden, and suggesting that it should be burnedafter a first reading. Charles Cammell took this so seriously that he burned thecopy inscribed to him by Crowley. But it is hard to see why Aiwas bothered todictate it if its study was forbidden; it sounds like another attempt by Crowleyto stake its claim as a supernaturally-conceived scripture. And as a piece ofsacred scripture, it often makes an unfortunate impression, like some parody offin de siècle prose by Max Beerbohm:Hold! Hold! Bear up in thy rapture; fall not in a swoon of the excellent kisses.Harder! Hold up thyself! Lift thine head! Breathe not so deep—die! Ah! Ah! Whatdo I feel? Is the word exhausted?His guardian angel also advised Crowley to ‘take wine and strange drugs…and bedrunk thereof’, promising that ‘thy death shall be lovely—whoso seeth it shallbe glad.’ In fact, following this advice was to be Crowley's ruination, so thathis death was anything but lovely. But the suggestion is certainly in conformitywith the central doctrine of The Book of the Law: ‘There is no law beyond Dowhat thou wilt.’ This seems to be an echo of Rabelais's Gargantua, in whichthere is an abbey that has inscribed above its door ‘Do what you will’ (Fay ceque vouldras), and this seems to be confirmed by the fact that the abbey iscalled Thélème, and The Book of the Law states: ‘The word of the law isThelema.’ Crowley's guardian angel may also have had in mind Blake's lines fromThe Everlasting Gospel:Do what you will, this life's a fictionAnd is made up of contradiction—an attitude which is certainly consistent with Crowley's moral philosophy. Yetechoes of Rabelais's sixteenth century anticlericalism sound as much out ofplace in this ‘sacred scripture’ as the reminders of Swinburne and Nietzsche.Symonds hits the nail squarely on the head when he writes:The Book of the Law lacks the numinosity or authority of prophetic writings; andits rebellious sentiments exude an atmosphere incompatible with the‘praeter-human intelligence’ which Aiwas was supposed to be.All this may seem to suggest that Crowley concocted The Book of the Law to stakehis claim as Mathers’ successor and the founder of Crowleyanity. Yet no one whoreads Crowley's endless essays and commentaries on it can maintain such a view.Nothing is more obvious than that Crowley believed totally in The Book of theLaw as some kind of supernatural inspiration, and as his chief claim to beremembered by future generations. The main problem for the averagereader—particularly of The Great Beast—is that Crowley seems such an intolerableshow-off that it is hard to believe anything he says. But then, a biography likeSymonds’ leaves out a whole dimension of Crowley's life. (He makes a moreconsistent attempt at understanding in its sequel, The Magic of AleisterCrowley.) It is impossible to understand Crowley unless we grasp that, likeMadame Blavatsky and Mathers and Yeats and Florence Farr, he took magic asseriously as Lord Rutherford took atomic physics. Literary commentators oftenmake the same mistake about Yeats: that he regarded magic as a romantic exercisein suspension of disbelief. Yeat's magical notebooks reveal this to have beenuntrue; they go into overwhelming detail about magical procedures and symbols,and show that he continued to be obsessed by it long after he ceased to be amember of the Golden Dawn.Crowley, for all his inclination to embroider the truth, undoubtedly obtainedcertain results—both at Boleskine and in Cairo—that convinced him that he hadthe makings of a great magician. It may be that these results were not at allwhat he supposed them to be; that when he thought he was communicating with hisguardian angel or some ancient Egyptian god, he was only establishing contactwith some loquacious disembodied intelligence whose only talent was tellingCrowley what he wanted to hear. Those who find the idea of disembodiedintelligences impossible to accept may prefer to believe that Aiwas, Horus andthe rest were projections of Crowley's unconscious mind. Nevertheless the onething that seems relatively certain is that they were not pure invention.The most sensible hypothesis about The Book of the Law is that it was largely aproduct of Crowley's own mind, but that he received it in a way that convincedhim that he was only the amanuensis. His central claim about the work is that itopens up communication with discarnate intelligences. But when he goes on toquote it on the subject of food, drink and lovemaking (‘eat rich foods and drinksweet wines and wines that foam! Also, take your fill of love as ye will, when,where and with whom ye will!’) and to explain that ‘the emancipation of mankindfrom all limitations whatever is one of the main precepts of the Book’, thereader recognises that Crowley really means ‘emancipation from the Victorianlimitations that made my childhood so miserable’, and that this was the onelimitation that Crowley never succeeded in escaping from. Because of thisobsession with the Plymouth Brothers and their intellectual and morallimitations, Crowley based his personal religion on a premise that would nottake in an averagely intelligent schoolboy: that since there is no such thing assin, everyone should feel free to indulge himself as much as he likes. Thismight work if all human beings were highly intelligent and self-disciplined, butat our present stage of social evolution, it would obviously be a disaster. Andthe fact that Aiwas—or whoever dictated The Book of the Law—shared thisdisastrous misconception seems to indicate that his intelligence fell well shortof the superhuman.Crowley admits that he also had his misgivings. But these were not about thephilosophical implications of The Book of the Law, but about his own adequacy tocarry out ‘a mission of such importance that the last event in the world'shistory of importance even approaching it was Mohammed's…’ All the same, he lostno time, when he arrived in Paris, in writing to Mathers to inform him thatsecret chiefs had now appointed him as the head of the order. Mathers ignoredit, and Crowley says ‘I declared war on Mathers accordingly.’Back in Boleskine, ‘life passed like an ecstatic dream’—at least, until Mathersbegan to mount a magical attack. He succeeded in killing most of Crowley's packof bloodhounds, and in making the servants ill. One of the servants suddenlybecame ‘maniacal’ and attacked Rose; Crowley drove him into the cellar with asalmon gaff and sent for the police. When Crowley finally evoked Beelzebub, the‘magical attacks’ suddenly ceased. In July, Rose gave birth to a girl whomCrowley named Nuit Ma Athanoor Hecate Sappho Jezebel Lilith. To amuse Roseduring her convalescence, he wrote an obscene novel, Snowdrops from a Curate'sGarden. He also began to publish his many volumes of poetry in collectedvolumes, whose title page bore the imprint of the Society for Religious Truth.For Crowley, the real joke was that his jest contained more than a grain oftruth.One of Crowley's former companions on Chogo-Ri came to stay—a Swiss named JacotGuillarmod. Crowley amused himself by spinning an absurd yarn about a dangerousbreed of wild sheep called the haggis, and when, one morning, his ghillie burstinto the room crying ‘There's a haggis on the hill’, they all rushed out intothe rain and spent an hour crawling uphill through the heather with their gunsat the ready. The joke was finally on Crowley when Guillarmod blasted away intothe mist and shot the local farmer's prize ram. Guillarmod had the ram's headstuffed and mounted.Guillarmod's purpose in coming to Boleskine was to persuade Crowley to go onanother Himalayan expedition: this time to the world's third highest mountain,Kanchenjunga, merely a hundred feet lower than Chogo-Ri. Crowley agreed, butonly on condition that he should be the leader of the expedition. According toCrowley Eckenstein declined to join them ‘for various reasons’, but according toSymonds, because Eckenstein declined to accept Crowley as a leader. No twoaccounts of the expedition could be more different than Crowley's and Symonds’;yet the weight of evidence seems to indicate that Symonds’ is more accurate.According to Crowley's version, the ascent of Kanchenjunga would have been aperfectly straightforward matter if Guillarmod had not broken his agreement toregard Crowley as the leader. Once Guillarmod became a rebel, and began todisaffect the others, everything began to go wrong.Symonds describes Crowley's view of Kanchenjunga as ‘optimistic to the point ofblindness.’ The approach is barred by precipices down which swept continualavalanches. When Guillarmod studied the route Crowley proposed to take, hebecame convinced that it was impossible. He also claimed to be appalled by thebrutal way Crowley treated the porters (over two hundred of them when theexpedition started), and was convinced that this was the cause of the failure ofthe expedition.Crowley had left Boleskine in early May and arrived in Bombay a month later.Guillarmod had found two more alpinists willing to join them and pay their shareof the costs: two Swiss officers named Alexis Pache and Charles Reymond. Crowleyhad enlisted a young Italian hotel manager named Righi, who could speakHindustani and Tibetan. After a two-week march through the valleys of Nepal,they began the ascent on 22 August 1905. Three days later, differences ofopinion had already developed, when Guillarmod found that Crowley had failed toprovide the porters with suitable footwear, and that some of them were expectedto walk barefoot on the glacier. Guillarmod felt that the steps Crowley cut inthe ice were dangerous; in fact, two days later, one of the porters lost hisfoothold on one of them, and fell to his death. Porters were now deserting indroves.On 31 August, a number of porters descended from Crowley's camp and toldGuillarmod they were tired of being beaten by Crowley and were leaving;Guillarmod succeeded in persuading them to stay by promising them thathenceforth Crowley would not lay a finger on them. (Crowley himself flatlydenies striking any porter.) Guillarmod and Righi decided that the only solutionwas to depose Crowley from the leadership of the expedition. When they arrivedat Crowley's camp the next day, there was a furious argument. In his ownaccount, Crowley falls back on his usual explanation that Guillarmod had becomementally unstable, and suggests that the rebellion was nothing more than theresentment of foreigners being led by an Englishman. Unfortunately, this was thebeginning of the end. Guillarmod declared that he was withdrawing from hisagreement to regard Crowley as the leader, and said he was taking his contingentback down the mountain to the lower camp—in any case, there was not sufficientroom for everyone to sleep at Crowley's camp. Crowley claims he warned the‘mutineers’ that they would be killed if they went down that night. Pachedecided to join them, his excuse being that the porter had failed to bring hisbed; it seems more likely that he was also anxious to escape from Crowley.Crowley warned him that he would be dead within ten minutes.The accident happened as Crowley had foretold. There were six men on therope—three Europeans and three coolies. A barefoot coolie slipped, dragging thenext man with him. Pache and another coolie also slipped. Guillarmod and Righitried to hold them, but it was impossible. Snow slipped from under their feet,causing an avalanche and soon they were also hurtling down the slope. Guillarmodwas thrown into a crevasse, and succeeded in pulling the unconscious Righi fromunder the snow that covered him. But it proved impossible to dig the other menout of the snow. The other officer, Reymond, who was in Crowley's camp, heardtheir shouts and came to help with the rescue work. According to Crowley,Reymond told him he would call him if he needed help, which is hard tobelieve—surely it was obvious that they needed help if they were screaming? ButCrowley, undoubtedly seething with resentment at the mutineers, turned over andwent to sleep, no doubt muttering ‘Serves them right.’And now the two stories of the expedition diverge completely. According toCrowley, Guillarmod now recognized that his leader had been right all along, andbecame very friendly. Then Crowley gave orders to Righi about bringing down hisbelongings, and sent for more porters to dig out the corpses. Then he went offto Darjeeling. Guillarmod's story, as reported by Symonds, is that Crowleydescended the mountain at dawn the next day, passing straight by them as if hefailed to see them. Crowley says he heard voices, and shouted in reply, butreceived no answer. So he left the expedition. In fact, it seems fairly clearthat Crowley simply deserted the expedition, leaving the mutineers to ‘stew intheir own juice.’ He cabled an inaccurate account of the expedition to the DailyMail in London, using to release his bile against the Alpine Club. Symondscomments: ‘If it was Crowley's intention to make himself odious in the eyes ofall mountaineers, he succeeded completely.’What is so astounding here is the incredibly bad judgement that Crowley showed.As far as mountaineers were concerned, to fail to go to the rescue of colleaguesin danger was the unforgiveable sin. But Crowley might have got away with it ifhe had pleaded—as he actually did—that it was some kind of misunderstanding,then hurried down the mountain at dawn to help in the rescue. By simply walkingoff the mountain he was guilty of dereliction of duty, and no excuse could thensave him from being regarded as a ‘cad.’ Worse still, he then returned toDarjeeling, and withdrew most of the expedition's funds from the bank (they hadbeen mostly supplied by the others) then wrote a series of self-justifyingarticles in an Indian newspaper.The matter is important because it was symptomatic of Crowley's most fundamentalweakness: his laziness. He admits in the Confessions that ‘it is part of mycharacter to rest on my oars when a spurt would take me past the post’, but hemanages to make it sound like some kind of modesty, the British gentleman'sindifference to winning the game. In fact, it was a childish tendency to abandonany responsibility the moment he felt the first sign of boredom. He simplyrefused to do anything he didn't like doing, no matter how much inconvenience itcaused to others. In a word, he was utterly spoilt. And in the long run, Crowleyhimself was the chief sufferer, for he acquired himself such a bad reputationthat it surrounded him like an unpleasant smell. It was the Chogo-Ri episodethat first revealed this fundamental weakness—his tendency to quarrel with mostother members of the expedition. But it was the Kanchenjunga expedition thatbrought it into the open, and placed Crowley's feet on the downhill slope thatwould end with complete social ostracism.In Darjeeling, Crowley had a ‘brief but intense liaison’ with a Nepali girlnamed Tenguft, and proceeded to study the Persian language, since he intended tovisit Persia on his way back to England. After that, he spent some time as theguest of the Maharajah of Moharbhanj and spent some time shooting bears andtigers—he was disappointed that he was not allowed to shoot elephants. He thenwrote a pornographic treatise on mysticism called The Scented Garden, which hedescribes modestly in the Confessions as ‘this spurt of genius’. All this, headmits, was in open defiance of the Secret Chiefs, who were anxious for him toget on with his major task: to bring the new religion to birth. When they pickedhim to do their work, ‘they meant me to get busy and do it’; they wanted him totackle the problem of his relation with the universe ‘as seriously as the Buddhahad done twenty-five centuries ago.’ So they arranged to administer a sharpreminder. One evening in Calcutta, Crowley set out by himself to find a bazaar,and in a dark street, was attacked by a band of robbers in white robes.Fortunately, Crowley's hand was on his loaded revolver, so even as they pinionedhis arms, he was able to pull the trigger. The men let go, and Crowley foundhimself free. Hurrying away from the dark alley, he recollected his earlierexperiments in making himself invisible, and decided to try again. According toCrowley, it worked, and he was able to pass through the excited crowds withoutbeing noticed. In The Great Beast, Symonds quotes from the Calcutta Standard,whose headline read: ‘Alleged Assault on European—Two Men Shot.’ A reward of ahundred rupees was offered for the arrest of the European. Crowley only admitsto firing one shot, but it seems more likely that, as was his custom, he blastedaway wildly until the gun was empty.The next day, 29 October 1905, his wife and daughter arrived; Crowley informedher that they were leaving immediately; offered a choice of China or Persia, shechose China, on the grounds that she was fed up with Omar Khayam. So theyengaged a nurse for the baby, and fled.They sailed for Rangoon, where Crowley left his wife and daughter in a hotelwhile he went to stay with Alan Bennett, with whom he discussed his spiritualquest. Then he and Rose sailed up the Irrawaddy to Mandalay. At Bhamo, anofficial kept him waiting for seventeen days for his passport, until Crowleywent over his head and obtained the permission he required; in the Confessionshe prints a long, sarcastic letter he wrote to the official, which reveals againthat Crowley was inclined to nurse his grudges. Finally they crossed thefrontier into China. It was a country that brought out some of Crowley's worstqualities. He explains that ‘one cannot fraternise with the Chinese of the lowerorders—one must treat them with absolute contempt and callousness.’ And sincethese contemptible creatures respected a traveller insofar as he wasoverbearing, haughty and avaricous, Crowley had an excuse for behaving at hisworst.In Tengyueh, Crowley found another father figure—the British Consul, Litton,whom Crowley compares to Sir Richard Burton, and acknowledges that he learnedmore from Litton about China than he had learned in the whole of his previouslife. But the relationship was brief—Litton soon died of some mysteriousdisease, possibly poisoned, and Crowley had the pleasure of flogging a Bengalidoctor—‘a burly nigger of the most loathesome type’—with a rawhide whip to forcehim to examine the body. They were able to reach no decision about the cause ofLitton's death, and Crowley and Rose set off, surrounded by ominous rumours ofnative uprisings (it was the time of the Boxer rebellion) and murderedEuropeans, for the Chinese interior. By this time the baby's nurse had run awaywith one of the muleteers, and Crowley had engaged a drunken Chineseinterpreter.Crowley's account of the ‘walk across China’ is a pleasant travelogue (‘Wecrossed the Salween by means of a bridge ornamented with shrines and adelightful and romantically beautiful house for the toll keeper’) punctuated byCrowley's opinions on aesthetics, Chinese cooking, opium and the stupidity ofEuropeans. He concluded that opium was a harmless and much maligned drug. ‘Thepictures drawn as to its effects are evidently coloured by the bias of theobserver.’ So he ‘purchased the necessary apparatus’ and learned to smoke it. Onthe day after New Year they crossed the Mekong into what is now Vietnam. Foodwas often scarce and they were occasionally forced to live for days on rice,Worcester sauce and dried milk. Crowley was disappointed that he had noopportunity to shoot a peacock. There was increasing friction between Crowleyand his servants, which Crowley fails to explain, but which was no doubt due tohis tendency to treat the Chinese with ‘absolute contempt and callousness.’ Theinterpreter, a Chinese named Johnny White, registered his own protest by ridingoff on Crowley's pony, which was considerable better than his own ‘sorry screw.’It was the wrong thing to do to a man as touchy and vengeful as Crowley, whomanaged to catch up with him unperceived, while he was crossing a thornyhillside. Crowley jerked him into a large thorn bush, and left him strugglingthere while his own coolies rode past, administering a blow from his whip aseach man passed. ‘I had no more trouble of any kind for the rest of the journeyto Yunnanfu’, he records with malignant satisfaction.By the time they reached Manhao, where Crowley was due to pay off his coolies,they were becoming ‘mutinous’; he accordingly worked out a scheme to get his ownback. Once he and Rose and their servant were installed in the boat, Crowley‘proceeded to pay the head man the exact sum due to him, less certain fines.’The coolies were enraged and called on the villagers to support them. As theyfaced ‘thirty or forty yelling maniacs’, Crowley ordered the Hindu servant tocast off the boat; understandably he was reluctant, so Crowley threatened toshoot him unless he obeyed. A few minutes later, Crowley looked back withsatisfaction as the current carried him away from the infuriated coolies; it wasthe kind of triumph he relished.En route to Hong Kong, Crowley decided that he and Rose would return to Englandin opposite directions; he would go via Shangai and America, while Rose couldreturn via Calcutta and pick up their luggage. He mentions this decision in theConfessions in the most casual way, as if it was perfectly normal to leave one'swife and child in the middle of Asia. What he takes care not to mention at thispoint is that he was going via Shanghai to call on his ex-mistress ElaineSimpson—the one who had worn her ceremonial robes to a fancy dress party. As itturned out, Elaine, whose magical name was Sister Fidelis, lived up to her nameand refused to be unfaithful to her husband. His guardian angel Aiwas, invokedby magical ceremonies, warned Crowley that Elaine would give him a great deal oftrouble, and that he ought to break with her. Yet, paradoxically, Aiwas alsoadvised him to make love to her, which seems to suggest that he was expressingCrowley's own desires. Frustrated and suffering from a bad cold, Crowley took aboat for Japan and Canada. He arrived back in England in early June, 1906, wherehe found letters awaiting him telling him that his daughter had died of typhoidin Rangoon."},{"pageContent":"FiveThe Master and the DisciplesFOR CROWLEY, 1906 was a year of disasters. Soon after his return, he had to havean operation to remove an infected gland in his groin. Then he picked up a chillin his right eye, which required more operations, all unsuccessful. This wasfollowed by neuralgia that continued for months. Finally, an ulcerated throatlaid him low for the rest of the year.He had also discovered, rather too late, that his wife was a dipsomaniac—whichenabled him to achieve the recognition that she was entirely to blame for thebaby's death, having failed to sterilize the feeding bottle when drunk. He alsoreached the curious conclusion that Rose's mother was to blame for havingallowed her children to drink champagne in childhood. So he ‘took the hag by theshoulders’ and kicked her downstairs. Symonds has the interesting remark:1907…was the year that he ‘went wrong’—or so he said during the 1920s in ananxious and melancholy period of his life. I think he meant that in 1907 therewas still time for him to turn back. Rose had given birth to a daughter, LolaZaza. He was thirty-two years of age. His roving boisterous past could be setaside as the Sturm und Drang period of his life. He had still a chance ofsettling down and getting on with the business of ordinary living; but he kickedhis mother-in-law downstairs instead…and strode on, into the Waste Land,praising the immortal gods.There is considerable penetration in this comment. Crowley's money was runningout, so there were good practical reasons for settling down and thinkingseriously about the future. But Crowley had become an addict, not to drugs oralcohol, but to magic. He had experienced strange mental states andextraordinary visions. He was convinced that he was aware of a whole dimensionof existence of which ordinary people are ignorant and, on the whole, he wasprobably right. Moreover, since his experience in Cairo in 1904, he was alsoconvinced that he was the Chosen One who was due to inaugurate a new era in thehistory of mankind. And since he was to be the new saviour, he had to become akind of symbolic Everyman, and fling himself whole-heartedly into theexperiences of this world:…the mission, in order to carry out for which I was incarnated, was a mission tomankind; and this must explain why, pari passu [at an equal rate] with mypersonal progress, I walked continually in the way of the world. My spirituallife was now therefore definitely duplex, and this fact must be kept in mind ifmy subsequent actions are to be properly understood.This vision of his destiny had been confirmed in Shanghai, when he had invokedhis Holy Guardian Angel. Aiwas ordered him to return to Egypt with Ouarda(Rose). ‘There I will give thee signs…Thus you shall get real power, that ofGod, the only one worth having. Illumination shall come by means of power, paripassu.’Another commentator on Crowley, Jean Overton Fuller, suggests that Aiwas wasactually some demonic entity sent to tempt Crowley, and points out that thevoice came from over Crowley's left shoulder—the left-hand path being the pathof black magic. But it seems just as likely that Aiwas was the voice ofCrowley's own unconscious mind (a suspicion reinforced by Aiwas's use of ‘paripassu’—not a phrase one would expect from an ancient Sumerian deity).At least this enables us to understand why Crowley found the idea of domesticfelicity intolerable. The avatar of the future religion, the chosen one of theSecret Masters, was treading the path of ‘real power’, the power of the gods.And in spite of lack of general recognition, he had no doubt whatever about hisown stature; in fact, lack of general recognition only led him to praise himselfmore vigorously:I had become so accustomed to columns of eloquent praise from the most importantpeople in the world of letters, which had not sold a dozen copies; to longcontroversial criticism from such men as G.K. Chesterton…People acquiesced in meas the only living poet of any magnitude…Yet hardly anyone had read any of mywork and the intrigues of my enemies had made it impossible for me to makemyself heard…So as his fortunes seemed to be in decline, he became more determined than everto batter the world into a recognition of his genius. And it was at this pointthat Crowley received a visit from a soldier who had served in the Boer War,Captain John Frederick Charles Fuller who—amazingly enough—had read some ofCrowley's work and decided he was a poet of genius. By way of publicising hiswork, Crowley had offered a prize of £100 for the best essay on it. Fuller wasthe only person who decided to compete. When the two men met at a hotel in theStrand, they found themselves immediately in tune. Fuller had been a member ofthe Rationalist Association, and took a Nietzschean view of the harmfulness ofChristianity. Yet he and Crowley were united in detesting the Marxists andothers who wanted social revolution. ‘We felt ourselves to be leaders…’But these views were still a long way from Crowley's notion of himself as thefounder of a new religion. How Crowley persuaded Fuller to regard him as thesuccesssor to Jesus Christ and Mohammed, as well as the greatest poet in theEnglish language, is still a matter of mystery. We can only assume that Fullerwas another example of that unique phenomenon, the English eccentric, whodoesn't give a damn about the opinions of his fellow Englishmen. It was, in anycase, a fair bet that none of his fellow Indian army officers would ever readThe Star in the West, ‘A Critical Essay upon the Works of Aleister Crowley’,which appeared in 1907. Crowley remarks: ‘The style of The Star in the West istrenchant and picturesque. Its only fault is a tendency to overloading.’ This isan understatement. Here is the opening paragraph of the introduction:At first sight it may appear to the casual reader of this essay, that thesuperscription on its cover [i.e. the title] is both froward and perverse, andcontrary to the sum of human experience. This however I trust he will find isnot the case and, as Ianthe, will discover that after the mystic union has beenconsummated, the beautiful daughter of Ligdus and Telethusa was as acceptable ayoung husband as ever wooed nymph on the shaded slopes of Ida.This was clearly not a work that would produce a revolution in the currentestimates of Crowley. Crowley accordingly failed to pay Fuller the promised£100.Much of 1907 was spent wandering around the Mediterranean with a dementednobleman whom he calls the Earl of Coke and Crankum, and whom Symonds identifiesas the Earl of Tankerville. The earl was suffering from paranoia, and believedthat his wife was trying to murder him by witchcraft; he was introduced toCrowley in a chemist's shop where Crowley bought his alchemical supplies. ‘Myplan in such cases is not to undeceive the patient’ says Crowley smoothly, andhe proposed to teach the earl how to perform magic to defend himself. It seemsclear that Crowley saw him as a heavensent answer to his own lack of funds; hesuggested a ‘magical retirement’, and they crossed the channel to Paris, thenwent to Tangiers by way of Marseilles and Gibraltar. Crowley devotes a chapterof the Confessions to describing their adventures in Morocco. They returned viaGranada, where Crowley had a passionate affair with a gypsy; the poem he wroteabout it contains the memorable lines:For your hair was full of roses, and my flesh was full of thorns. And themidnight came upon us worth a million crazy morns.Inevitably, the earl's paranoia turned against Crowley; but in theautobiography, Crowley forgets to mention this, as the description of his gypsylove affair leads him to speak of other loves who provided inspiration for hispoetry. It was left for Symonds to unearth a revealing comment made by LordTankerville to Crowley before they parted on bad terms: I'm sick of yourteaching—teaching—teaching—as if you were God Almighty and I were a poor bloodyshit in the street.’What is interesting about this comment is that it makes it clear that Crowleyhad a powerful compulsion to teach. This is something that is easy to forget aswe read about his life, with its scandals and broken friendships and seductions.In fact, this is the trap into which most of Crowley's biographers have fallen,from Symonds onwards. Crowley's life becomes merely an outrageous story, a kindof moral fable about selfishness and depravity, like Bunyan's Mr Badman. And, asthe present writer can testify, it is practically impossible to avoid beingsucked into this particular whirlpool, if only because Crowley's life presentssuch an ideal opportunity for telling a good story. Yet the moment the readerturns to one of Crowley's own books—like his dictionary of ceremonial magic 777,written at about this time—it is to realise that, whatever Crowley's faults as ahuman being, he was undoubtedly totally serious about magic and mysticism. Andthat moreover, from his own point of view, there was a great deal ofjustification for some of his more ‘disgraceful’ actions. He writes:Fortunately we have learnt to combine these ideas [of mysticism and magic], notin the mutual toleration of subcontraries, but in the affirmation of contraries,that transcending of the laws of intellect which is madness in the ordinary man,genius in the Overman who had arrived to strike off more fetters from ourunderstanding…And quite suddenly, in a flash, it becomes possible to grasp Crowley's ownvision of the world, and to see what he was aiming at. He felt that he had seen,and directly experienced, a Dionysian vision of ‘beyond good and evil.’Nietzsche had seen the same vision, and horrified his contemporaries bydenouncing Christianity and writing in praise of war. Nietzsche had once beenovertaken by a storm in a mountain hut where a shepherd was slaughtering a goat,and the smell of blood and the bleating of the goat had combined with the crashof the thunder and the beating of the rain, so that he had written: ‘Will, purewill, without the troubles and perplexities of intellect—how happy! how free!’But when such a vision is expressed logically, in a work like A Genealogy ofMorals, with its denunciation of the weak, it becomes ugly and frightening.Crowley saw himself as Nietzsche's true heir—after all, Nietzsche had only diedin 1900—and was determined not to be driven insane by that paradoxical vision.He found himself surrounded by people who did not even begin to understand thevision, in whose eyes he was merely a rather vulgar and unpleasantexhibitionist. So kicking his mother-in-law downstairs was more than a burst ofbad temper; it was a symbolic gesture, like Rastignac shaking his fist in Parisand exclaiming: ‘It's between the two of us now.’While Crowley was quite determined to live out his life according to hisNietzschean vision, he also recognized that it would probably involve a lifetimeof misunderstanding and hostility. In his own eyes, this made him a kind ofmartyr. And this is precisely how Charles Cammell and Israel Regardie andKenneth Grant have seen him. Admittedly, they manage to present Crowley in thislight by concentrating upon his magical aims and glossing over the scandal. Butit at least has the effect of presenting the other side of the picture, andshowing Crowley as he saw himself. The reader who really wants to understandCrowley will have to practise the difficult exercise of switching from one pointof view to the other.Crowley himself was determined to master this art. This is why, on his returnfrom Morocco, he wrote a series of hymns to the Virgin Mary. He explains:I simply tried to see the world through the eyes of a devout Catholic, very muchas I had done with the decadent poet in White Stains…And the comment that follows gives us a glimpse of the real calibre of Crowley'smind:I did not see why I should be confined to one life. How can one hope tounderstand the world if one persists in regarding it from the conning tower ofone's own personality? One can increase one's knowledge and nature by travellingand reading: but that does not tell one how things look to other people. It isall very well to visit St Peter's and the Vatican, but what would be reallyinteresting would be to know how they look to the Pope. The greatness of a poetconsists, to a considerable extent, in his ability to see the world throughanother man's eyes…If Crowley had developed this aspect of himself, he would certainly have becomeone of the great writers of the twentieth century; it was precisely this kind ofrestless intellectual exploration that turned Yeats into one of the greaterpoets of the age. Crowley, unfortunately, lacked this passionate obsession withideas for their own sake.It was also in 1907 that Crowley decided that, since the Golden Dawn refused toaccept him as its natural leader, he would form his own magical order tosupersede it. He called it the Silver Star—the Argenteum Astrum, or A.A. In theearly days there were only two other members: the ‘alchemist’ George CecilJones, and Captain Fuller. Crowley proceeded to write a series of ‘scriptures’for his order, such as the Liber Cordis Cincti Serpente (Book of the Heartgirdled by a Serpent) and Liber vel Lapidus Lazuli. They were not, he explained,dictated by his guardian angel, nor of his composition, but somewhere betweenthe two.Speaking of his decision to restore magic to its original purity, Crowley againhas a passage that allows us a glimpse into his basic insights. He is speakingof the ‘ordeals’ that the neophyte has to pass through to become an adept, andhis determination to re-establish their essence:I was at first ignorant enough of Magick to imagine that this could be done bythe simple process of replacing sham formalities by real ones. I proposed, forexample, to test people's courage by putting them in actual contact with thefour elements, and so on, as was apparently done in ancient Egypt; butexperience soon taught me that an ordeal, however severe, is not much use ingenuine initiation. A man can always more or less brace himself to meet asituation when he knows that he is on trial…But Crowley reached the interesting conclusion that all this was unnecessary;once a probationer had taken the oath ‘to perform the Great Work, which is toobtain the knowledge of the nature and powers of my own being’, he seemed to‘rouse automatically the supreme hostility of every force, internal or external,in his sphere’—in other words, that he would set into motion certain forces thatwould subject him to the ‘ordeals.’ This is a passage of central importance, forit reveals that Crowley's interest in magic was based upon an intuitiveconviction that there are certain unknown laws of being which shape humanexistence, and that these laws cannot be cheated. (Jung's idea of‘synchronicity’ is based upon the same intuitive insight.) Crowley's ownultimate failure seems to suggest that, in spite of this knowledge, he wasunable to resist the temptation to cheat—that is, to take ‘short cuts.’Soon the Silver Star acquired another neophyte, a strange-looking youth namedVictor Benjamin Neuburg. Jean Overton Fuller describes him as he was some yearslater:He was all head, the body being a slight affair as to its skeletalstructure…Rich brown locks grew from above a broad forehead surmounting finelychiselled, aristocratic Jewish features. But it was his eyes that wereeverything. They were in shadow from his brows and additonally screened bydeeply hooded lids, but opened to disclose an astonishing quality offorget-me-not or celestial blue…Crowley heard about him through Captain Fuller, and called on him in his roomsat Trinity when he happened to be in Cambridge. Crowley describes him as a massof neuroses with ‘lips that were three times too large for him.’ But Neuburg wasfull of ‘exquisitely subtle humour’, well read, and ‘one of the best naturedpeople that ever trod the planet.’ Neuburg had tried practising mediumship, andCrowley instantly divined that he had an extraordinary capacity for Magick.Neuburg was captivated by Crowley, and an unsuccessful attempt by the Dean ofTrinity to ban Crowley from the college only strengthened his loyalty. WhenCrowley, tired of trying to keep Rose off the bottle, retreated to Paris,Neuburg went with him. Crowley made him the butt of a number of cruel practicaljokes, including getting him paralytically drunk on Pernod, and persuading himto get engaged to an artist's model who was Crowley's own mistress. (Neuburg wasshattered and miserable when Crowley told him the truth.) Then, in an attempt toforce Neuburg into some kind of contact with the real world, Crowley dragged himon a walking tour through Spain where, because they were so badly dressed, theywere mistaken for brigands.Crowley also invited Neuburg up to Boleskine for a ‘magical retirement.’ Infact, Neuburg soon learned the Kabbalistic technique of ‘rising on the planes’,imagining one's astral body to be rising into the air and entering the astralrealms. Neuburg attained remarkable proficiency in a fairly short time,confirming Crowley's suspicion that he was naturally gifted in Magick. In one ofhis earliest experiences, he encountered the angel Gabriel, clad in white, withgreen spots on his wings, and with a Maltese cross on his head. On anotheroccasion he had a ‘bad trip’ and encountered a red giant against whom he waspowerless, and who cut Neuburg to pieces and chased him back to his body.Crowley taught him the ‘Harpocrates formula’, through which he slew the redgiant.It must not be assumed that these descriptions are lies or fantasies;innumerable practitioners of magic have experienced them, and there is such abasic similarity in all their descriptions that it must be assumed that there isan objective component in the experience. If we assume that what happens isentirely ‘psychological’, and has nothing to do with spiritual entities, then atleast the experience is some kind of exploration of an inner landscape which iscommon to all of us. The easy assumption—that Crowley and other Golden Dawnmembers were simply playing a game of self-deception—is ultimately untenable.When we realise that Crowley was responsible for introducing Neuburg to theseamazing realms of self-exploration, it becomes possible to understand whyNeuburg regarded his guru with a kind of adoration. But there was clearlyanother bond: that Crowley was inclined to sadism, while Neuburg had masochistictendencies. One evening, Crowley accused Neuburg of lingering among the Qlipoth,the harlots of the astral plane, and ‘corrected’ him by giving him thirty-twostrokes with a gorse switch, drawing blood. ‘He is apparently a homosexualsadist’, wrote Neuburg in his magical diary1 [part0009.html#fnr1] ‘for…heperformed the ceremony with obvious satisfaction.’Crowley also beat Neuburg on the buttocks with stinging nettles; and since allthis seemed to fail to make Neuburg suffer, he began to make coarse anti-semiticremarks. This upset Neuburg. ‘It is the very limit of meanness to grouse at aman because of his race.’ He describes Crowley as ‘a cad of the lowest type.’And at the end of the ten day retirement, Crowley made Neuburg sleep for thenext ten nights on a bed of prickly furze (another name for gorse), in afreezing cold room—Jean Overton Fuller believes that this is how Neuburgcontracted the tuberculosis that finally killed him in 1940, at the age offifty-seven. At the end of this twenty day ordeal, Crowley told Neuburg he hadpassed his probation, and would be admitted to the lowest neophyte grade (knownas 10 = 1.) During this period at Boleskine, Neuburg met Rose, who was obviouslyfar gone in dipsomania—Crowley claims she was drinking a minimum of a bottle ofwhisky a day. Crowley goes to some length in the autobiography to insist that hewas still deeply in love with her (he described their marriage as one longsexual debauch), and that their divorce in 1909—to achieve which he supplied herwith evidence of adultery—was really for her benefit.After the magical retirement, Neuberg accompanied Crowley back to London, andhelped him prepare the second volume of The Equinox, a ‘review of scientificilluminism’, a ‘periodical’ (actually, a series of bulky volumes running to overfour hundred pages each) which Crowley proposed to publish twice a year, at thespring and autumn equinoxes. They contain a mixture of verse, plays and,‘magical scriptures’, and are generally regarded as Crowley's major literary(and magical) legacy. Volume two appeared a few days after the autumn equinox of1909. After this, Crowley and Neuburg went off to North Africa for yet anothermagical retirement.The retirement was to be devoted to ‘Enochian magic’—a form of magic revealed tothe Elizabethan occultist Dr John Dee through the mediumship of his ‘scryer’ (orseer) Edward Kelley. A series of invocations, or ‘calls’, were dictated to Deeand Kelley in an unknown language called Enochian, which sounds like gibberish:‘Madariatza das perifa Liil cabisa micaolazoda saanire caosago…’; their purposewas to summon up demons. Nineteen of these Calls or Keyes were dictated, and thenineteenth is designed to allow the magician access to thirty ‘Aires’ oraethyrs—these being spiritual planes or dimensions of consciousness. In Mexicoin 1900, Crowley had explored the last two of these Aires through the use of thenineteenth invocation; now he set out to explore the remaining twenty-eight. Ifwe can believe Crowley's own account of this ‘magical working’, contained in adocument called The Vision and the Voice, he achieved a series of strangevisions of angels, demons and other spirit entities. In the fifteenth Aire,Crowley was told that he had now been promoted to the grade of a Master of theTemple—the experience he had longed for ever since reading The Cloud Upon theSanctuary; it meant that he himself was now one of the Secret Chiefs.Most of these explorations had been conducted during the periods of rest betweentramps across the desert of Morocco. Neuburg, who had now received the nameOmnia Vincam (‘I shall conquer all’) had been made to shave his head, except fortwo tufts of hair on his forehead, dyed red and twisted into the shape ofdemonic horns. On December 3, 1909, Crowley and Neuburg climbed Mount Dal'lehAddin, near the village of Bou-Saada, and Crowley tried to enter the fourteenthplane or Aire. But there was some obstruction—he only encountered layer afterlayer of blackness. Crowley decided to call it a day, and they proceeded todescend the mountain. Then Crowley was seized by a sudden inspiration. He andNeuburg went back to the mountain top, and proceeded to practise an act ofbuggery, in which Crowley was the passive partner; they dedicated it to the godPan. (In the autobiography, Crowley only says euphemistically that he‘sacrificed himself’.) After this, Crowley staggered back to Bou-Saada in asemi-mystical state in which ‘all impressions were indistinguishable.’ When hecame to himself, on his bed, he found himself changed. ‘I did not merely admitthat I did not exist, and that all my ideas were illusions, inane and insane. Ifelt these facts as facts.’ And when, later that evening, he tried theinvocation again, the veils of blackness were drawn aside, and he was admittedinto a circle of stones, which he soon recognized to be veiled Masters. Theangel told him that he had spent his life trying to achieve fame, power andpleasure, and that now he had become one of these Masters, who were as lifelessas stones. In a sense, Crowley had died. (Jean Overton Fuller comments that whenCrowley decided he had transcended the condition of ordinary men, he ‘ceased tobe completely sane.’)The next three Aires brought more revelations about the nature and duty of aMaster. On 6 December, it was time for a magical task involving some difficultyand danger. Crowley had to cross a symbolic abyss between ordinary men and theSecret Chiefs and, in order to do this, he had to invoke the demon of the Abyss,Choronzon. For this purpose they wandered around Bou-Saada until they found avalley floored with fine sand. They constructed a circle of rocks, and nearbydrew a triangle, killing a pigeon at each angle and sprinkling its blood.Protective ‘names of power’ were traced in the sand. Neuburg sat within theinner circle, while Crowley, who was to act as a kind of ‘medium’ for Choronzon,sat outside, within the triangle. According to Francis King, such an act isunique in the history of magic. Then Crowley repeated the invocation, andNeuburg repeated a magical oath. Things then quickly began to happen, althoughthe various accounts leave some doubt about precisely what it was. A voice thatsounded like Crowley's cried: ‘Zazas, zasas. Nasatanda zazas!’, the words withwhich Adam is supposed to have opened the gates of Hell. Then Choronzonappeared, and began to utter blasphemies. After this, Neuburg beganhallucinating, and thought Crowley had changed into a beautiful woman he hadknown in Paris. She proceeded to tempt Neuburg, who resisted. Meanwhile Crowley,who was wearing a black robe and a kind of Ku Klux Klan hood, called out: ‘Ithink that's all there is.’ He was mistaken. The courtesan offered to lay herhead at Neuburg's feet in token of submission, an offer he again refused. Thenshe turned into an old man, then into a snake. After this, Neuburg saw Crowleyhimself crawling towards him, begging for water; knowing this was anotherdelusion caused by Choronzon, he refused. Neuburg then conjured the demon, inthe name of the most high, to declare his nature; Choronzon replied that hedidn't give a damn for the most high, but admitted that he was Master of theTriangle. Neuburg, becoming nervous, asked protection from Aiwas, but Choronzonreplied that he knew Aiwas, and that ‘all their dealings with him are but acloak for thy filthy sorceries.’ Neuburg was trying to write all this down—forCrowley was apparently in a trance—but as he did so, the demon succeeded inblotting out a small part of the magic circle with sand, and suddenly leaptinside, in the form of a naked man (presumably Crowley was still sitting in hisyoga position within the triangle) and grappled with Neuburg. It tried to bitehis throat, and Neuburg tried to stab it with a magical dagger. Eventually, hedrove Choronzon out of the circle, and repaired the break with his dagger. Thecourtesan returned, but was again rejected. Choronzon begged to leave thetriangle to get his clothes, but was refused. After trying unsuccessfully tomake Neuburg admit that magic was all nonsense, the demon gave up, and ‘was nomore manifest.’ Finally, Crowley wrote the word ‘Babalon’ in the sand with hisring. The tenth invocation was over. He and Neuburg then lit a huge fire topurify the place, and destroyed the circle and the triangle.Crowley's note to the account states that he ‘spoke…in spite of himself,remembering afterwards scarcely a word of his speeches’, which seems to make itquite clear that Choronzon spoke through his mouth. This would seem to suggestthat the naked man who wrestled with Neuburg was again Crowley himself. But thisfails to explain Neuburg's other hallucinations. It seems fairly clear thatsomething extraordinary took place on that afternoon of 6 December 1909.Crowley and Neuburg resumed their march the next day, this time walking acrossopen desert (so far there had been roads), ignoring warnings from officialsabout brigands. As they marched towards Biskra, they continued to ‘call’ theaethyrs. At the Royal Hotel in Biskra, too exhausted to write, Crowley dictateda letter to Captain Fuller, referring several times to ‘dear, kind Victor’, butalso mentioning that he was having an awful job keeping Neuburg away from Arabboys for whose brown bottoms he had a ‘frightful lust.’ This is one of the fewindications that Neuburg, like Crowley, was bisexual.The episode of the fourteenth call had brought Crowley a profound insight, whichwas to dominate the rest of his life: the recognition that sex was one of themost effective ways of ‘focusing the mind’, and that therefore it could be usedas an aid to magic. It may have been this insight that decided Crowley to breakhis vow to the Golden Dawn, and publish their secret rituals in the third issueof The Equinox. This was too much for Mathers, who hurried to London and filedan injunction to prevent publication. To Crowley's rage, a judge confirmed theinjunction. Crowley promptly appealed, and also consecrated an Abra-Melintalisman to aquire the affection of a judge. It seems to have worked; at least,the appeal was successful, and the third volume of The Equinox contained theforbidden material.But all this cost money, and Crowley was beginning to run out—even his chiefdisciple Neuburg was not a bottomless well. In May 1910, he was struck by aninteresting idea. At the home of a Commander Marston in Dorset (the commanderwas obsessed with tom-toms, which he believed had an aphrodisiac effect onwomen) Victor Neuburg went into a trance, in the course of which he performed aritual dance. (He also correctly prophesied that there would be two wars overthe next few years, one involving Turkey, one involving Germany, and that thewars would bring about the ruination of both countries.) Marston suggested thatthe dances deserved to be performed publicly, and Crowley scented the idea ofmaking money. A few weeks later, a performance was given at Crowley's flat inVictoria Street—this was to be a ‘dummy run.’ Crowley had recently acquiredhimself a new mistress, a half-Maori violinist named Leila Waddell, whoseplaying, according to Crowley, was ‘coarse, crude, with no touch of sublety.’She was to play while Neuburg danced, and Crowley read his own poetry. Crowleyhad devised seven ‘rites.’ A young woman named Ethel Archer, whose verse hadbeen submitted to The Equinox, later described that evening to Jean OvertonFuller. She and the rest of the audience sat on cushions on the floor, and weregiven a ‘loving cup’ that tasted like rotten apples, but which contained somedrug which soon made them ‘high’ (the effect lasted for a week). Then Neuburgdanced, while Leila played; Crowley claims she played like a master, andastounded the critics. After an impressive dance in which he whirled like adervish, Neuburg collapsed on the polished floor. A highly favourable reviewappeared in the Sketch.Now convinced that this was a paying proposition, Crowley decided to hire CaxtonHall, and charge five guineas for a series of ‘Rites of Eleusis’ that would takeplace on seven consecutive Wednesdays. Each evening would be dedicated to a ritebased on one of the seven planets.Crowley's description of the rite of Saturn sounds highly impressive, withsymbolic dances taking place behind veils, while a voice recites verses fromJames Thomson's City of Dreadful Night complaining about the meaninglessness oflife and advocating suicide. But this time the press was lessfavourable—notably, Horatio Bottomley's John Bull and a scandal sheet called TheLooking Glass. The critic of The Looking Glass described how he was admitted bya ‘rather dirty looking person attired in a sort of imitation Eastern robe’(probably Neuburg, who was notoriously averse to washing.) Then ghostly figuresappeared on the stage, and a man who looked as if he had come out of a Turkishbath. The figure of ‘the Master’ appears, and the ghostly figures beg him totell them if there is a God. The stage is plunged in darkness, and after awhile, the Master returns and declares that there is no God, and that everyoneshould do as they like and make the most of this life. The writer then went onto hint that sexual irregularities probably took place in the darkness, andbacked up his speculation by offering a potted history of Crowley. It referredto his association with a ‘rascally Buddhist monk’ named Alan Bennett, with whomCrowley had indulged in ‘unmentionable immoralities’, then went on to mentionGeorge Cecil Jones, and to imply that he had also had homosexual relations withCrowley. It seems likely that this scandalous gossip originated with Mathers.Captain Fuller was thoroughly upset—after all, he had written a book aboutCrowley, and would now have to live down the imputation of being anotherhomosexual. It was true that he was married, but then, so were Crowley andJones. To Fuller's annoyance, Crowley declined to sue The Looking Glass. ButJones decided to go ahead on his own. The result was disaster, The Looking Glassinsisted that it had not claimed that Jones was a homosexual, but argued thatanyone who was closely associated with Crowley had no reputation to lose. Acertain Dr Berridge, a friend of Mathers, appeared as a witness, and claimedthat he had once asked Crowley if he knew that people thought he was a sodomite,and that Crowley had failed to deny it. Evidence of Crowley's indecent sense ofhumour was produced in court—such as the Latin marginal notes to an essay whoseinitial letters spelt piss, cunt, arse and quim. This finally convinced the jurythat Jones had no case; they found that the allegation that he was a homosexualwas true in substance and in fact. Captain Fuller was so upset that he broke offhis friendship with Crowley. Recruitment to the Silver Star, which had beenprogressing healthily, now began to fall off. For the first time, the generalpublic became aware of Crowley as a man of sinister reputation. For yearsCrowley had been out to shock and outrage the English, with absolutely noeffect. One senses from his poetry and short stories that he often felt that anykind of notoriety was preferable to total lack of recognition. It must have beena startling experience to realise that his message was suddenly getting across,and that the notoriety was not an unmixed blessing. From now on for the rest ofhis life, Crowley would be unable to escape a reputation for wickedness.For the moment, however, he was unaware of the disadvantages of being regardedas unspeakable. When he heard that Epstein's monument to Oscar Wilde inPère-Lachaise had been covered over with a tarpaulin because the statue's penisoffended the guardian of the cemetery, he launched a campaign to defy thepuritans. Having distributed pamplets asking the public to come and support himat midday on 5 November, he hid in the cemetery until the gates were closed,then sawed through the cords holding the tarpaulin, and attached thin wires sothat a good tug from behind a nearby tree would unveil the statue. In duecourse, the crowds arrived, but the soldiers Crowley had been expecting to findon guard were absent. The French authorities had decided not to exposethemselves to ridicule, and Crowley's unveiling of the statue was an anticlimax.Later, when he discovered that the penis had again been hidden from sight (thistime by a bronze butterfly) he sneaked into the cemetery and stole it, thenwalked into the Café Royal in London wearing it as a codpiece, ‘to the delightof the assembled multitude.’ His craving for publicity was like an unquenchablethirst.After this episode, Crowley and Neuburg returned to his ‘beloved Sahara.’ It wastheir intention to practise more Enochian magic and gain visions of the sixteensub-elements, but Crowley found that, magically speaking, he was simply not onform, and gave up. He concluded that magic depends not on the conscious will,but on the ‘true will’, which may or may not be favourably disposed.On 11 October 1911, Crowley attended a party at the Savoy given by the dancerIsadora Duncan for the birthday of her close friend Mary d'Esté Sturges, ‘amagnificent specimen of mingled Irish and Italian blood’, exactly the sort ofextraordinary woman who always attracted Crowley. Crowley had recently learnedthat his ex-wife had been certified insane from ‘alcoholic dementia’, and wasready for a fresh adventure. Mary seems to have put up a certain tokenresistance, but when Crowley turned up at her Paris flat a few weeks later, shesurrendered and accompanied him to Switzerland. Mary Sturges knew nothingwhatever of magic. Retiring to bed one night after heavy drinking and somevigorous sex, Crowley was awakened by Mary, who seemed to be hysterical, andraved about some vision she had just experienced. She had seen a man calledAb-ul-Diz, who had spoken to her of matters she did not understand. Crowleyfinally recognized that Ab-ul-Diz was speaking in the language of magicsymbolism, and that he knew Crowley's occult name, Perdurabo. (Crowley insiststhat Mary had never heard it.) Finally, Ab-ul-Diz announced that he wouldreappear in precisely one week, and took his leave. A week later, in the PalaceHotel in St Moritz, Ab-ul-Diz again appeared to Mary, and another magicalconversation ensued. Mary was told that her magical name was Virakam; butotherwise, the exchange was frustrating and disappointing. But at least itseemed clear that, like Rose and Victor Neuburg, she was a natural ‘scryer.’Subsequent encounters with Ab-ul-Diz led Crowley to believe that he was beingordered to go to Italy, and there write a book on magic. When he asked how hewould recognize the place, a message flashed into his consciousness: ‘You willrecognize it beyond the possibility of doubt or error’, and he saw a picture ofa house on a hillside, with two Persian nut trees outside. And many days later,as they passed an overgrown lane in the car, Mary suddenly ordered the chauffeurto drive down it. When it seemed they could go no further, they found the villawith the nut trees. It was under repair, and the foreman told them it was not tolet. But he proved to be mistaken; the owner allowed them to rent it for a smallsum, and they moved in. And there Crowley dictated and Mary transcribed the workknown as Book Four, one of Crowley's best and clearest expositions of theprinciples of yoga and his magical ideas.One midnight, as he finished dictating, Mary was astonished when Crowley's facebegan to change, as if he was becoming a number of different persons insuccession. Then the room filled with golden light, and Crowley's chair seemedto float off the ground and become a throne. Moreover, Crowley seemed to bedead. Mary fainted.Book Four was intended to be in four parts; but after the second part, theyquarelled—Mary seems to have possessed a violent temper—and rushed back toParis. There she relented and telegraphed Crowley to join her, which he did. Butthere were more quarrels, and soon she showed unmistakable signs of becoming analcoholic. According to Crowley, she then married a Turkish adventurer, who beather, then deserted her. Crowley felt, in any case, that a magical partnershipwas out of the question. ‘Her own masterless passions could hardly have allowedher to pass unscathed through the ordeals which are always imposed upon thosewho undertake tasks of this importance.’ Crowley seems to have been a remarkablyacute judge of other people's characters; it seems strange that he displayed solittle insight into his own.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0009.html#fn1]. Quoted extensively by Jean Overton Fuller in The MagicalDilemma of Victor Neuburg (1965); the episode is also described at length in TheMagical World of Aleister Crowley by Francis King (1977)"},{"pageContent":"SixThe Magic WandEVER SINCE his vision of the fourteenth aethyr at Bou-Saada, Crowley had beendimly aware that there was some unfathomed connection between the two majorinterests of his life: sex and magic. The insight that was trying to breakthrough into his awareness was that if sex is to be more than a merely physicalactivity, it demands precisely the same kind of mental disciplines as magic. Atthe time Crowley was attempting to form his own magical society to supplant theGolden Dawn, a Russian man of genius was organizing his first groups offollowers in Tiflis and Moscow. His name was George Gurdjieff, and his centralrealization was that the human mind is appallingly feeble and undevelopedcompared to the human body. We think that our lives have purpose and continuity,but this is only because the body is relatively durable. The mind that controlsit changes from moment to moment. Our only chance of achieving any kind of realcontinuity is to make tremendous and sustained efforts of will. Gurdjieff's workconsisted of various disciplines to make this effort possible.By comparison, Crowley lacked profound insight into human nature; he wasted fartoo much time and moral energy fighting a rearguard action against the religionof his parents and grandparents. He never rid himself of the simplistic ideathat the real aim of life is to enjoy oneself. Yet Crowley recognizedinstinctively that magic could offer some of the disciplines that his schoolinghad failed to instill. The way of the Kabbalah demands a high level ofconcentration and discipline of the imagination. Yet Crowley freely admits thathe was too easily bored, and was always neglecting his magical disciplines. Likemost of us, Crowley greatly preferred play to work. Tom Sawyer points out thatwork is what one is obliged to do and play is what one is not obliged to do. Soas soon as Crowley committed himself to a discipline, the law of reverse effortimpelled him to abandon it.Now if there was one thing that Crowley preferred above all others, it was sex.And sex, by definition, was play. Yet that experience on Mount Del'leh Addinoffered Crowley a glimpse of an amazing truth. Sex is also a discipline of theimagination. A man who makes love while thinking of something else will notreally enjoy it. Conversely, a man who has spent a long time pursuing the girlof his dreams will treat lovemaking as a sacred rite; he will concentrate so asnot to lose a single drop of the experience. Sexual pleasure depends upon acertain vital energy, but the mind is the funnel through which this energy ispoured. Again, when a man is in bed with a girl in the dark, he has lost most ofthe visual aids that enabled him to appreciate her; the ‘funnelling process’must include a certain capacity for visualisation—again, the same capacityrequired by a student of the Kabbalah.What was slowly dawning on Crowley in the year 1911 was that sex could providean easy and pleasant method of achieving ‘magical concentration.’ But at thisstage it remained, as it were, in suspension, waiting for some event tocrystallize it.This event occurred in the following year, when Crowley received an unexpectedvisit from a German named Theodore Reuss, who introduced himself as ahigh-ranking German Freemason and the head of a magical order called the OTO—theOrdo Templi Orientis, or Order of the Temple of the East. And, to Crowley'sastonishment, Reuss accused him of betraying the secrets of the ninth grade ofthis order. Now it so happened that Crowley was a member of the OTO—he hadjoined it in the previous year. But then, Crowley was a kind of collector ofsecret societies, and he had joined it thinking it was simply another order ofFreemasons (otherwise, why did it call itself a temple?). Crowley hastened topoint out that he had not reached the ninth grade, and so could not betray itssecrets. Reuss then reached out and took from Crowley's shelf his recent workThe Book of Lies, and pointed to a section that opened: ‘Let the adept be armedwith his magic rood and provided with his mystic rose.’ Reuss was obviouslyunaware that although ‘rood’ means rod in old English, it is generally used of acrucifix, and that this is what Crowley meant by it.1 [part0010.html#fnr1]Crowley had a flash of intuition, and realized that the ‘secrets’ of the ninthdegree were sexual in nature. He and Reuss had a long conversation about magicand sex, and found themselves in close sympathy. And when Reuss left, he hadallowed Crowley to found an English branch of the OTO. Crowley had to go toBerlin to be initiated; typically, he chose for himself that magical nameBaphomet—the name of the demonic idol that the Knight Templars were accused ofworshipping.The rituals of the OTO were not simply an excuse for sexual orgies. The orderhad been founded around the turn of the century by a rich German named KarlKellner, and Reuss was his successor. (He seems to have been rather an oddcharacter: a member of the German secret service, a journalist, a music hallsinger, and a political agitator who tried to infiltrate the London Marxistorganization.) Kellner had been heavily influenced by the branch of Hinduismknown as Tantra, an attempt to achieve mystical union with the universe byregarding it as a continuous process of creation. This was blended with orthodoxwestern magic, which is based upon the belief that the mind can exercise adirect influence on nature. One of the most widespread forms of magic, forexample, is the charging of talismans with magical power—a talisman is a ‘charm’designed to help its owner to achieve a certain end, such as wealth or sexualconquest or fame. A talisman would normally be ‘charged’ by the performance of aritual of ceremonial magic. In the OTO, two ‘initiates’ would perform a ceremonyculminating in a sexual act, concentrating on the aim of the magical operation,and end by anointing the talisman with a mixture of sperm and the secretions ofthe vagina, known as the ‘elixir’, or amrita.Crowley's discovery of sex magic was indisputably the major turning point of hislife. It united his two central aims: to be a magician and to be a sexualathlete. There was undoubtedly another aspect of Tantrism that attracted him. InTantric legends, most of its saints are initiated by a woman who is the ‘powerholder.’ She might be a prostitute or a temple dancer, or some other form of‘untouchable’, and one of the aims of uniting with her is to lose caste, tobreak all bonds with the everyday world. Crowley, with his strong masochistictendencies, loved this idea of a female power holder, and it explains why,sexually speaking, his preference was for thoroughly experienced women likeRose, Leila Waddell and Mary Sturges.Crowley must have deeply impressed Reuss, for Reuss not only agreed to allowCrowley to set up an English branch of the OTO, but seems to have accepted thebasic tenets of The Book of the Law. (After losing this for several years,Crowley had rediscovered it in his attic in 1909, and had since becomeincreasingly convinced that it was the Bible of the new religion that wouldreplace Christianity.) Crowley's first act on becoming head of the London OTOwas to rewrite all its rituals in his own inimitable style.2[part0010.html#fnr2] They are, of course, full of quotations from The Book ofthe Law, and laced with Crowleyan blasphemies, such as a section on the BlackMass in which Crowley attacks Roman Catholicism as ‘that base and materialisticcult’, and praises practitioners of the Black Mass because ‘at least they set upMan against the foul demon of Christians.’ When published in the German organ ofthe OTO, the Oriflame, Crowley's rituals caused some scandal among Germanmembers, and Reuss was heavily criticized. Even Reuss must have recognized bythis time that Crowley was a man whose egocentricity knew no limits, and whowould never be contented until he he had turned the OTO into an organization forthe propagation of Crowleyanity. But before this could happen the First WorldWar had broken out, and the problem was temporarily shelved.But in 1913, it began to look as if Crowley had finally solved his financialproblems with the help of magic and the OTO. He was charging a fairly high sumfor initiation into ‘its nine grades (£103.10s) and thirty-three guineas a yearmembership fee. He had also succeeded in finding a theatre to present hismagical rites (the Old Tivoli) and under the name of the ‘Ragged Ragtime Girls’,they were a considerable success. There were seven girls, including LeilaWaddell, and Crowley said they were three dipsomaniacs and four nymphomaniacs.In the summer of 1913, the girls were engaged by a Moscow theatre, and Crowleyaccompanied them. In a café he met a Hungarian girl named Anny Ringler, ‘tall,tense, lean as a starving leopardess, with wild insatiable eyes’, who had passedbeyond the region where pleasure had meaning for her—Crowley means she was amasochist. Since he had a strong sadistic streak, they seemed made for oneanother, and they spent many idyllic hours in flogging and being flogged. It wasCrowley's first experience of such a relationship, and for the next six weeks hewrote poems, plays, stories and magic rituals in a state of creative ecstasy.Back in England, Crowley decided it was time to make full use of his newlyacquired knowledge of sex magic. For this purpose, he and Neuburg went to Paris,and prepared to begin a long series of sex-magic rituals that Crowley wouldlater call ‘The Paris Working.’ The ‘working’ began on the last day of 1913,when Crowley ‘received the sacrament’ (performed an act of sodomy) from ‘thepriest A.B.’—probably a journalist named Walter Duranty, foreign correspondentof the New York Times. Then Crowley painted a pentacle, a symbol of the godMercury, whom they were trying to invoke, and Neuburg danced the ‘banishingritual’, after which they invoked Thoth-Hermes (Mercury), and Crowley scourgedNeuburg on the buttocks, cut a cross on the flesh over his heart, and bound achain round his forehead. Forty minutes later, at midnight, the ceremony wasconcluded with an act of buggery, in which Crowley was the passive partner.Crowley records in his magical diary that he thought the room was full ofsnakes—symbols of Mercury, who has them entwined around his staff—while Neuburgwas convinced that he was possessed by the spirit of the god. But Neuburg foundit hard work, and failed to reach orgasm.The following day, the ritual was repeated at the same time, and this timeNeuburg succeeded in achieving an orgasm, and was so completely possessed by thegod that Crowley was able to ask Mercury questions about how the rite could beimproved. The rituals went on until 12 February and have been described atlength by Symonds and Francis King.3 [part0010.html#fnr3] At one point the godsuggested that Crowley still suffered from sexual shame, and Crowley performedan act of sodomy in front of his friends at the house of his mistress JaneCheron; his partner was Walter Duranty. One day, Neuburg became possessed by thegod, and they were told that the supreme act of sex magic would consist ofraping and murdering a young girl, dissecting her body into nine pieces, andoffering them as sacrifices to various Greek gods. This was too much even forCrowley, and they decided to ignore it. During the thirteenth rite, themagicians had an insight into a previous life in which they had been together inancient Crete—Crowley as a temple dancing girl and Neuburg as a young candidatefor initiation; as a result of his failure to perform ritual rape on the dancinggirl, both Neuburg and Crowley were sold into slavery. This revelation ledCrowley to realize that he was unlucky for Neuburg; he might have gone furtherand reflected that he was unlucky for just about everybody he knew.One of the aims of the Paris Working was to obtain money for Neuburg. In this itwas apparently successful—a kindly aunt provided funds; but to Crowley'sdisgust, Neuburg bestowed the money on ‘unworthy guests.’ In fact, Neuburg wasgetting sick of Crowley. Jean Overton Fuller comments in her book on Neuburg:He [Crowley] did physical things, homosexual practices apart, of so revolting anorder that I have thought it preferable not to repeat the examples I have beengiven.4 [part0010.html#fnr4] [She adds:] He exploited others upon every plane,material, emotional and psychic.And, it seems, back in London ‘Victor was brave enough to see [Crowley]…and tellhim he could go no further, and disavowed the oath he had taken at his receptioninto the Argentinum Astrum. Then Crowley ritually cursed him.’Neuburg seems to have had another reason for breaking with Crowley; he believedthat Crowley had murdered his (Neuburg's) mistress, Joan Hayes. She had beenrecruited by Crowley in 1910 to dance in his ‘Rites of Eleusis’ at Caxton Hall,having answered an advertisement in The Stage. Rebecca West, who knew her atthis period, described her as an innocent girl, ‘nice, stupid, very affected,good natured…with a tragedy ahead of her because of her ambition and her quiteevident lack of gifts.’ She was the type Crowley found completely unattractive,being anything but a ‘scarlet woman.’ But she was undoubtedly Neuburg's type,and Crowley seems to have been relieved when she married a friend of Neuburg's,Wilfred Merton. But the marriage did not last; six months later, Joan Hayes—nowcalling herself Ione de Forest—moved into a Chelsea studio and became Neuburg'smistress. Crowley was furious; he referred to Joan as ‘Circe’, and expressed theapprehension that she would seduce Neuburg away from the magical path. Neuburgand Joan Hayes took a cottage in Essex for weekends in the summer of 1912; twomonths later, she shot herself. In Magick in Theory and Practice, Crowley statesthat he ‘once found it necessary to slay a Circe who was bewitching brethren. Hemerely walked to the door of her room and drew an astral T (‘traditore’) and thesymbol of Saturn with an astral dagger. Within forty-eight hours she shotherself.’ So it seems reasonably clear that, whether or not Crowley wasresponsible for her death, he certainly intended to be.Crowley was in Switzerland when the Great War broke out, training for anotherattempt on Kanchenjunga; with some difficulty he succeeded in getting back toLondon via Paris. There, he claims, he tried hard to get some work serving theBritish government—phlebitis in his left leg made it impossible to join theforces. He was told he had no qualifications, even for the censor's office, sohe decided to go to America, arriving in November, 1914. The war had put an endto his income from the ‘Rites of Eleusis’, and he was soon so hard up that hewas forced to send back to England for some of his rare books and manuscripts tosell to an American collector, John Quinn. In the event, Quinn bought far lessthan Crowley had hoped. With no friends from whom he could borrow, no faithfuldisciples—like Neuburg—to exploit, Crowley found himself facing real poverty.Before leaving England, he had started to keep a magical diary, with details ofhis operations of sex magic. On 3 September, he records that he possessed ‘MarieMaddingley—respectable married woman’ and adds: ‘The girl was very weak,feminine, easily excitable and very keen, it being the first time she hadcommitted adultery.’ He records that the elixir—the mixture of male and femalesecretions, presumably drunk in an act of cunnilingus—was ‘first rate.’ Threedays later, the partner was Peggy Marchmont, a Piccadilly prostitute, ‘a sturdybitch of 26 or so’. It seems clear that Crowley's powers of sexual endurancewere considerable, for he records that the ‘orgie’ lasted from eleven in themorning to ten at night. ‘I was not at all exhausted and could have gone on allnight.’ Oddly enough, the girl refused payment. On 14 October, ten days beforehe sailed, he performed a sexual ‘operation’ with a chorus girl, Violet Duval,assisted by Leila Waddell, though he does not explain what part Leila played.In New York on 7 November, he was reduced to performing the sexual ceremony onhis own, with his left hand, imagining Babalon (as he spelled it fornumerological reasons), the Scarlet Whore. A week later, having sold themanuscripts to John Quinn, he was able to afford Elsie Edwards, an obese Irishprostitute who charged $3, but the ‘unattractiveness of the assistant’ made theoperation difficult. On 21 November, the assistant was Florence Galy, the‘lowest type of prostitute, very negroid in type.’ (Later, he adds that she isnow in prison for theft.) After three weeks of solitary operations ‘in manibus’(in the hand), he performed an ‘orgiastic operation’ with a Dutch prostitute,‘the muscular wolf type’, who inspired him to magnificent efforts, although hecomplained that her secretions were not very plentiful and his semen was notproperly dissolved therein. Crowley was becoming something of a connoisseur—heeven refers to his sperm as being ‘of excellent vintage’. But in a subsequentoperation with the same girl, Crowley had diarrhoea, and had a prematureejaculation, and the elixir was of an acrid and aromatic type. He continued toperform operations with this partner through most of December and the first twoweeks of January, although on 16 January 1915 he records an encounter with‘Margaret Pitcher, a young, pretty-stupid, wide-mouthed flat-faced slim bodiedharlotry’ with fair hair and a ‘fine fat juicy Yoni’—this time the elixir was‘of pleasing quality’.On 26 January Crowley met a widow, Lola Auguste Grumbacher, a Brazilian with aprofile like Dante, admitting to thirty-seven years of age, and found her‘astoundingly passionate’. On the 26th she ‘received the seed into her mouth’and so did Crowley. An hour later, she became so sexually excited that she wasviolently and repeatedly sick, which Crowley took to be evidence that she waspossessed by the god Pan.On 22 May, in the dimly-lighted steam room of a Turkish bath, Crowley was twicesodomised by strangers, and performed fellatio on another. A few days later,Crowley picked up another stranger called Finch, and was the passive partner inanother magical act of sodomy. Finch invited Crowley to dinner with his wife (ormother it is not clear which) and Crowley seems to have attached greatimportance to this occasion, hoping that it might be some kind of breakthroughin his so-far disastrous American career. On the morning of the dinner, he evenperformed a special sexual operation with a young mulatto prostitute namedMamie, dedicating it to making ‘a good impression on Mrs Finch and Co’. But theoperation itself was a total failure. And, inevitably, the dinner wascancelled—perhaps because Mrs Finch discovered the nature of Crowley's relationswith Mr Finch.Crowley's account of all these magical operations make one thing perfectlyclear: that the magic was not some kind of excuse for sex. For Crowley, magicwas a religion, and he meditated on Hermes or Thoth as a Christian monk mighthave meditated on Christ or the Virgin. The man who had found the magic of theGolden Dawn rather boring and tiresome had now become a single-minded magicianwho thought and practised magic every hour of his life.But on the day after the Finch fiasco, Crowley's period of frustration came toan end. A journalist friend invited him to dinner to meet two women, a poetessand an actress. The poetess was called Jane Foster, and she and Crowley wereviolently attracted to one another. The actress, Helen Hollis, ‘glittered withthe loveliness of lust’, and was also apparently attracted to Crowley; but hemuch preferred Jane. The next day, at her club, Jane proposed to divorce herhusband and marry Crowley. But she had to leave New York for a month, duringwhich time Crowley continued to perform magic with prostitutes. When shereturned, they became lovers; but she proceeded to torment Crowley by tellinghim that she detested the physical side of love (perhaps because he had insistedon sodomising her). Then she left New York again. In a state of misery, Crowleyinvited her rival, Helen Hollis, out to lunch, then took her back to hisapartment, and without further ado, gave her a lengthy ‘serpent kiss’ with twoteeth he had had specially filed for that purpose.5 [part0010.html#fnr5] Theresult was a mutual ‘surge of amorous frenzy’, and after a twelve hour orgy, hewoke up ‘purged of iniquity’ and in a mystical state of love. This experiencesomehow convinced him that he should now produce a son who would also be hismagical heir, and on her return, he and Jane Foster laboured to this end,apparently without success. What became of Helen Hollis is not clear, shevanishes from the autobiography.By now, Crowley had found himself employment—of a sort. One day, sitting on topof an omnibus reading an English newspaper, he was asked by an Irishman whetherhe believed in a ‘square deal for Germany and Austria.’ When he replied in theaffirmative, he was invited to come to the office of a newspaper called TheFatherland, edited by a man Crowley had met in London: George Sylvester Viereck,a German-American poet. Crowley, scenting employment, turned on all his charm,and even threw in the falsehood that he was Irish; Viereck promply hired him towrite anti-British propaganda for The Fatherland, directed at German-Americans.Crowley's version of this discreditable episode is contained in a lengthychapter of the Confessions, in which he prints a justification that he wrote afew years later. This justification is that he was actually attempting todiscredit German propaganda by making claims so preposterous that no sane readercould swallow them. The Fatherland, Crowley said, was learned and logical; hewould make it stupid and absurd. ‘I worked up Viereck gradually from relativelyreasonable attacks on England to extravagances which achieved my object ofrevolting every comparatively sane human being on earth.’ But, he says, he didit with such cunning that the Germans never suspected he had his tongue in hischeek. It was a brave and noble sacrifice on Crowley's part—to allow his fellowcountrymen to think him a traitor when he was actually working for the benefitof his country. He would have been saddened but not surprised by the lack ofunderstanding of his motives. Years later, John Symonds wrote to Crowley's‘friend’ Commodore Sir Guy Gaunt, director of British Intelligence in America,to ask if it was really true that Crowley was working for British interests inAmerica. Gaunt replied:I think you describe him exactly when you refer to him as a ‘small timetraitor.’ As regards his activities, I think they were largely due to a franticdesire for advertisement—he was very anxious to keep his name before the publicsomehow or other.But he revealed that the British government was sufficiently worried aboutCrowley's activities to recall Gaunt from America to discuss what could be done;Gaunt urged that Crowley and The Fatherland were too unimportant to be worthworrying about. This view seems to be confirmed by the lack of impact ofCrowley's other Fatherland publicity stunt: he and Leila Waddell (who had joinedhim in New York) took a motorboat out to the Statue of Liberty one morning, andCrowley made a speech renouncing England, proclaiming his willingness to fightto the last drop of his blood for Irish freedom, then tore up an envelope which(he declared) contained his British passport. Then Leila played ‘The Wearing ofthe Green’ on her violin. Crowley then sent a report of his gesture to variousnewspapers, but only the New York Times printed it. This gesture, Crowleyexplains in his Confesssions, was designed to win the trust of the Germans. TheHon. Everard Feilding saw the item in the New York Times and wrote Crowley apained letter, but when Crowley replied explaining his true motives (to hoodwinkthe enemy) Feilding apparently ‘understood and approved.’ At least, so Crowleyassures us; Feilding's view of the matter has not survived.Presumably as a result of his writings for The Fatherland, Crowley had now madeenough money to travel, and he proceeded to rush from New York to Detroit,Chicago, Vancouver—where one of his former disciples had set up a magicalgroup—then to Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles. There he attempted to seeKatherine Tingley, head of the American Theosophical Society, intending topropose an alliance, but his reputation had preceded him, and she declined tosee him. He returned east via the Grand Canyon, which he found inferior to theHimalayas. Somewhere along the road back to New York he discarded Jane Foster,having decided that she was unworthy after all—he had come close to marryingher.In New York he met the Indian writer on religion, Ananda K. Koomaraswamy, andlost no time in seducing his wife, a Yorkshire woman, who moved in with Crowleyand became pregnant. Koomaraswamy apparently agreed to a divorce until his wifesuddenly made a success as a singer (Crowley claims all the credit) and decidedhe wanted her back after all. But after a great deal more to-ing and fro-ing,she returned to England to have the baby, and had a miscarriage on the boat.Crowley was not too concerned about all this, for he was now in a state ofimmense excitement about a more important matter. The disciple in Vancouver—aman named Jones, known as ‘Frater Achad’—had written to say that he had had amystical vision, and that the Secret Chiefs had informed him that he was nowready to become a Master of the Temple, the same grade as Crowley himself.Crowley calculated that this happened precisely nine months after he and JaneFoster had tried so hard to beget a son. The conclusion was obvious. Although heand his mistress had failed, a son had been begotten in the magical sphere, andwas therefore (presumably) ready to begin promulgating the doctrines ofCrowleyanity, as prophesied in The Book of the Law. This also meant, of course,that Crowley had to move up another grade if he was to retain his superiorposition. In fact, Crowley had already awarded himself the supreme grade ofMagus in the previous year (1915) and he now only had to ratify it with thecorrect magical ceremonies. This involved catching a frog, baptising it as Jesusof Nazareth, then crucifying it on a cross and stabbing it with a dagger. Allthis he did in the summer of 1916 near Bristol, New Hampshire and, havingsymbolically set himself up in the place of Christ, he gave himself a newmagical name, Master Therion, or The Beast. Crowley might be unsuccessful in theworldly sense, but in the spiritual sense he was rising like a rocket.In December 1916, Crowley went on a ‘General Strike’ against the Secret Chiefs,demanding some sign from them. Presumably this was successful, for by the end ofJanuary 1917 he was back in full swing with his sex magic, his ‘assistants’including Sister, a ‘big black muscular negro whore’, Titusville Maddy, aprostitute, Anna Grey, and a man called Howard, on whom Crowley performedfellatio. In August he lived for a while with another Scarlet Woman, AnnaMiller, a Dutch woman whom he called the Dog. Increasingly, the list of magicaloperations include the letters ‘p.v.n’, meaning per vas nefendum (‘by theunmentionable vessel’)—sodomy. When she became an alcoholic (a fate that seemedto overtake most of Crowley's mistresses) he got rid of her and began an affairwith Roddie Minor, a ‘big muscular sensual’ matron, with whom the operationswere also p.v.n. He called her the Camel. After her name, Crowley added the word‘Aphrodite’—meaning, as the editors of the Magical Record point out, that themuscular, sensual type was Crowley's ideal of feminine beauty.Perhaps because Crowley encouraged her to take cocaine and opium, the Camel soonbegan having visions. She saw an egg full of convolutions of some flesh-likesubstance in a strange landscape, with a camel in the foreground. Then sheencountered a wizard, an old man with a grey beard, dressed in a long blackgown, who was infinitely wise. There was also a king who reminded her of aprofessor of her acquaintance. Crowley told the Camel to introduce herself as‘Eve’, and ask the wizard's name. Instead of replying, he indicated that she hadto build a fire of sticks. When she had done this, she saw a vision of a lionand a naked child. The wizard finally put his arm round her and told her: ‘It'sall in the egg.’ So the vision ended.More visions followed. Crowley was excited because the wizard (his name provedto be Amalantrah) was able to answer a ‘test question’ on the exact spelling andmeaning of Crowley's magical name Baphomet; he said it was Bafometh, and meantFather Mithras. Moreover, the Camel's visions always seemed to involve the samelandscape. ‘There was,’ says Crowley, ‘what I may call a permanent background tothe vision. He lived in a place as definite as an address in New York, and inthis place were a number of symbolic images representing myself and severalother adepts.’ Jung had made a similar observation about his own curious visionsof an ‘underground world’ in 1913,6 [part0010.html#fnr6] and of an old mancalled Philemon. Jung had written: ‘Philemon and other figures of my fantasiesbrought home to me the crucial insight that there are things in the psyche whichI do not produce, but which produce themselves and have their own life.’ In hisconversations with Philemon, the old man said things which Jung had notconsciously thought. Jung also observed that these ‘visions’ were accompanied bycurious ‘synchronicities’, meaningful coincidences, and Crowley made the sameobservations. When he asked the wizard whether he could transpose his magicaltitle ‘Therion’ into Hebrew letters, he was told that it was possible; he triedhard, but had no success in making the Hebrew equal the number of the Beast,666. Two days later, he received a letter from some unknown Hebrew scholar whichsolved the problem—a letter which had been written at just about the time he wastrying to solve it himself.The Camel had a series of interesting visions, which are described in detail inan unpublished record, The Amalantrah Working. (Symonds gives a condensedversion in later editions of The Great Beast.) They produce a strong impressionthat Crowley had discovered the key to the same mental ‘underworld’ as Jung, andthat his excitement was justified. At the very least, Crowley's magicalexperiments may be regarded as an interesting development of what Jung called‘active imagination.’Relations with the Camel began to deteriorate when Crowley met an attractiveRussian woman called Marie Lavroff, whose resistance to his advances led him tocall upon all his techniques of seduction. She held out for more than afortnight, but finally, at midnight on 22 March 1918, joined Crowley and theCamel in an act of sex magic, designed to help Marie to transcend her ‘sincomplex’ and to help the Camel to transcend her understandable jealousy. But twodays later, after masturbating Crowley [which was apparently as far as she waswilling to go] she fled, and the following operations of sex magic wereconducted with the Camel alone. That summer, Crowley decided to go into anothermagical retirement, this time on Oesopus Island in the Hudson river. A writerfriend, William Seabrook, managed to raise the money for Crowley's trip, as wellas a canoe and a tent. When they went to see him off, they discovered thatCrowley had spent every penny on tins of red paint and ropes—he told them that,like Elijah, he would be fed by the Ravens. Crowley used the ropes and red paintto print EVERY MAN AND WOMAN IS A STAR, and DO WHAT THOU WILT SHALL BE THE WHOLEOF THE LAW on cliff faces on either side of the river, where they could be seenfrom passing steamers. In fact, he was fed by neighbouring farmers. The Camelmade a habit of coming to join him for weekends.Crowley tells an amusing story that illustrates that, in spite of hisincreasingly bloated appearance and pointed teeth, he was still attractive towomen. An artist friend in New York told him that he knew of a girl who was justCrowley's type, a redhead named Madelaine George. Crowley left a note at herhotel, inviting her to drop in for lunch on his island. To his surprise, hereceived a telegram a few days later asking him to meet her at the station.Crowley was disconcerted when she arrived with a huge trunk, and she wasdisconcerted to find that she was being taken to lunch in a canoe, and thatinstead of a mansion full of servants, Crowley possessed only a tent. She hadhysterics and declared that she had to leave after lunch to see an imaginarybrother. Crowley persuaded her to go for a row round the island, in the courseof which the canoe sprang a leak and almost sank. After more hysterics anddemands to be taken to the mainland, she decided to make the best of it andswooned into Crowley's embraces. She stayed for a long weekend.Crowley was already involved with another ‘scarlet woman’ who would becomesomething of a permanent fixture. One evening in the spring of 1918, a womannamed Alma Hirsig—whom Crowley had met after one of his lectures—called at hisWashington Square studio, together with her younger sister Leah. The latter wastall and thin, with luminous eyes, a wedge-like face, and a totally flat chest.‘She radiated an indefinable sweetness. Without wasting time on words, I beganto kiss her. It was sheer instinct.’ Leah seemed to enjoy it, and they continuedkissing for the rest of the evening, occasionally coming up for air to makepolite replies to the sister. Leah stayed the night. The next time the twocalled, Crowley punctuated the conversation by removing Leah's clothes, andasked her to come and pose for him—Crowley had started to paint while he was inAmerica. In due course, he painted her as a ‘dead soul’, with a ghastly greenface, surrounded by monsters. And she became his latest Scarlet Woman.A subsequent ‘magical retirement’ on Long Island convinced him that his magicalcurrent was temporarily exhausted and that it was time to leave America. Hestayed only long enough to supervise the publication of an eleventh and, it wasto prove final volume to The Equinox, then, after a final night in the arms ofthe Camel, set sail for England.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0010.html#fn1]. Symonds and Francis King point out that the Book of Liesbears the date 1913, but King argues convincingly that it was actually publishedin the previous year.2 [part0010.html#fn2].

See my Lord of the Underworld, pp. 74–6."},{"pageContent":"SevenThe Abbey of Do-What-You-WillFOR A PENNILESS exile, London in the December of 1919 was not a particularlywelcoming place. According to Frank Harris (quoted by Symonds) Crowley leftbehind him in New York a string of dud cheques. He was hoping that the OTO wouldhave money in the kitty, but soon discovered that the treasurer had embezzledit. He went to stay with an aunt in Croydon while he brooded on the future. Hismind turned to Victor Neuburg, but his ex-disciple was nowhere to be found—infact, he had read of Crowley's return in a newspaper, and was determined toavoid him. (He was living in Steyning and going through an ‘Elizabethan period’,dressing in breeches and leggings.) Crowley's health was poor; he was sufferingfrom asthma and bronchitis, and the heroin and cocaine to which he had becomeaddicted in America had lowered his resistance. A meeting with George CecilJones—the man who had introduced him to magic—was a disappointment; Jones hadbecome a respectable bourgeois. After less than two weeks in England, Crowleyleft for Paris. There, a week later, Leah Hirsig joined him; she was pregnantwith his child.On 1 February 1920, he was cheered by what he took to be a sign from the gods.He called on an ex-mistress, Jane Chéron, hoping to smoke opium and make love toher. There was no opium and she refused to make love; but as he was leaving, sheasked him to close his eyes, then presented him with a large square of cloth onwhich she had embroidered in silk the stele of Ankh-f-n-Khonsu, which he hadseen so many years before in Cairo when The Book of the Law was dictated to him.She had made a drawing of it (from The Equinox) during a sleepless night, thendecided to embroider it for him. Crowley was overwhelmed and he later referredto the event as a ‘miracle’. It confirmed his belief that his steps were beingguided by the gods. After anal sex with Leah, he noted in his diary: ‘I amwaiting without the least anxiety or eagerness for a new Current or a Word.’He had installed Leah and her three year old son Hansi—by a former lover1[part0011.html#fnr1]—in a rented house at Fontainebleau. Now she told him that,on the boat from New York, she had met a French girl named Ninette Shumway, awidow who also had a three year old son and who was looking for a position as agoverness. Crowley proposed that she should join them; his imagination wasalready toying with the idea of a ménage à trois. In fact, he was even dreamingof a ménage à quatre, for he was in correspondence with an American film starnamed Jane Wolfe, who had declared her passion for him by post, and with whom hewas convinced he would fall in love at first sight—Crowley had a powerful streakof old fashioned romanticism. He went to Paris to meet Ninette Shumway, whoproved to be a pale, tired-looking girl with a miserable child. She wasobviously the type who could be dominated, so Crowley lost no time in sweepingher off to Fontainebleau. In his autobiography he tells how, on a May afternoon,they had lunch in a restaurant, then made love in the woods. But his magicaldiary shows that he was already performing sex magic with her within a few daysof her arrival in mid-February. Shortly thereafter, he dreamed that he wasinside a cave which he recognized as her vagina—a dream possibly inspired by thefact that she was trying hard to take him away from Leah. A few days later, Leahgave birth to a daughter, whom Crowley called Poupée.Money was short, but Crowley was awaiting a cheque from his lawyer—probably aninheritance.2 [part0011.html#fnr2] He was thinking about setting up an abbeymodelled on Rabelais's Thélème, and spent some time looking at houses. He wasprobably grateful to get out of the house; having two wives was proving lessdelightful than expected, and he had to call upon every ounce of his pedagogicauthority to convince them that jealousy was a childish emotion. The childrenwere also a strain (‘I am ready to bolt to some country where children areunknown’), but Crowley was unexpectedly patient with them. He tried asking the IChing—the ancient Chinese oracle—where he ought to go. It was distinctivelynegative about Marseilles and Capri, but positive about Cefalu, the little portin northern Sicily. The I Ching also advised him to do nothing about an articlein the magazine John Bull attacking him for his traitorous activities during thewar; the oracle was undoubtedly correct. (Crowley relieved his indignation bywriting the long apologia that appears in the Confessions, Chapter 76.) On 22March 1920, he set out for Marseilles with Ninette and the ‘brats’, havingdespatched Leah to London to try to sort out his financial affairs. In Naples afew days later, Ninette was giving him trouble. ‘A long, miserable night due toBeauty's sexual insanities.’ Apparently Ninette had been something of a prude,and was shocked by Crowley's sexual demands. But she seems to have given way,for the following afternoon he records that she had taken part in an operation‘by the unmentionable vessel’, and that it was orgiastic and prolonged. But hecomplains about being interupted by children. The following day, the moneyfinally arrived, and he was able to go on to Cefalu.The local hotel was so dirty that he swore he would not spend a second nightthere. At that moment, a man arrived who told them he had a villa to let. It wasup a narrow path that wound its way up a mountain outside the town. The ‘VillaSanta Barbara’ resembled a run-down farm, but for Crowley it looked like a havenof peace: ‘a well of delicious water…a vast studio opening northwards’. Andthere were two tall Persian nut trees outside the house, just as there had beenin the earlier haven he shared with Mary Sturges. There was a magnificent viewas far as Palermo and a garden full of flowers and fruit. The next day heclambered over the mighty rock of Cefalu, and visited temples of Jupiter andDiana; for dinner he ate thigh of kid and local sausage. It seemed a paradise.With his two wives and three children, the Master Therion felt he had at lastcome into his own.The central hall was sanctified as a temple, in the centre of which stood analtar. Crowley soon covered the walls with pornographic paintings, one showing aman being sodomised by Pan, while his gushing seed covers a naked woman. But hisaim, as he never tired of explaining, was to persuade people to take sex forgranted, and stop regarding it as something thrillingly indecent—a notion thatseems paradoxical, since this is obviously why Crowley enjoyed it so much. Butit is a fact that visitors to the abbey were surprised that sex played so smalla part in their lives.Symonds makes the penetrating comment that Crowley was as serious about hismagical religion as his parents had been about the Plymouth Brethren. In asense, he was reverting to type. Life in the Abbey of Thelema was conducted onmonastic lines, starting with a kabbalistic prayer and a ritual procession,followed by an adoration of the sun. This was all repeated at noon, in theevening and again at midnight. The children—who had ceased to snivel and becomehealthy, outdoor types—probably found it all rather like being at a Baptistschool. The chief difference was that Crowley left piles of heroin and cocainearound, from which guests could help themselves. (He even tried practising sexmagic under ether, and found that it heightened his consciousness of the wholeoperation.) On great occasions they performed the lengthy Gnostic Mass whichCrowley had written for the OTO in 1913. The Communion involved ‘cakes oflight’, whose recipe included menstrual blood. But life was not quite idyllic.Leah and Ninette were inclined to quarrel, and to Crowley's disgust, a quarrelbroke out in the middle of a sex ritual to celebrate the entry of the sun intoTaurus, and Ninette, practically naked, rushed out into the rainy darkness, soCrowley had to search for her. When he got her back, Leah was drunk and startedanother fight.Crowley spent a great deal of time daydreaming about Jane Wolfe, who was now onher way to meet him. He had suggested that they should meet in Bou-Saada, sceneof his vision of Choronzon, then changed his mind and telegraphed her to go toTunis instead. He went there to meet her, but was unable to find her—she hadfailed to receive his telegram and gone to Bou-Saada. In his magical diary,Crowley frequently mentions his love for her. ‘I adore her name. I hope she ishungry and cruel as a wolf.’ On 18 June there is a long entry in which he vowstotal obedience to her. ‘I am hers…I die that She may live…I drown in delight atthe thought that I who have been Master of the Universe should lie beneath Herfeet, Her slave, Her victim, eager to be abased…’ But this thought reminds himof his greatness:I am aflame with the brandy of the thought that I am the sublimest Mystic in allhistory, that I am the Word of an Aeon, that I am the Beast, the Man Six HundredSixty and Six, the self-crowned God whom men shall worship and blaspheme forcenturies that are not yet wound on Time's spool…His imagination was further inflamed by the cocaine which he was taking inincreasingly large doses. He was now an addict, and spends pages writing aboutthe effects of cocaine in his magical diary. Sniffing it causes his nose tobleed. Cocaine seems to have intensified his masochistic feelings, and on 22July he swore to take Leah as his high-priestess and to act accordingly. AndLeah, also half-insane with drugs, was perfectly willing to assume the role; sheordered him to lick her dirty feet, and Crowley obeyed. The following day, whilehe was asleep, Jane Wolfe arrived at the Abbey of Thelema. She was a shatteringdisappointment. Crowley seems to have assumed that, because she had been a filmstar, she would be beautiful; in fact, she was a battered, tough-looking lady ofabout his own age. He compared himself to a girl who was told she would meet adark distinguished gentleman, and found he was a one-eyed nigger. She had beenattending spiritualist seances and had received messages from various ‘Masters’;Crowley read their messages, and was disgusted by their asininity. ‘During herfirst few weeks at the abbey, every day was one long battle. I hacked throughher barbed wire of aggressive axioms. I forced her to confess the incongruity ofher assertions. I drilled holes in her vanity and self-satisfaction.’ Moreover,she was a highly moral lady, who was shocked by the decor and the goings-on inthe abbey. Crowley decided that she either had to be subdued or ejected. He toldher that she should begin her training with a long period of meditation—in fact,a month of it, in a tent on top of the promontory, looking down on the sea.According to Seabrook (whose account is based on her diary) ‘she told the MasterTherion he was crazy. He told her there was a boat touching next day atPalermo…and there was the open door.’So, she accepted. During the next month she lived in the tent, wearing only awoollen robe, eating bread and grapes brought to her by a boy. During the firstfew days she was nervous and uncomfortable, angry and resentful. Then she became‘calm but bored’. Then, after the nineteenth day, she suddenly plunged into amood of ‘perfect calm, deep joy, renewal of strength and courage’. Suddenly, sheunderstood what Crowley had meant when he told her that she had the sun, moon,stars, sky, sea and the universe to read and play with.Seabrook's explanation is that she had ‘let go of herself’ in New York, and‘gotten hold of herself’ in solitude. But the truth is almost certainly thereverse. In New York she had become accustomed to stress, tension, endlesshurry, until she had lost contact with her instincts, the ‘forces of the rightbrain.’ She had forgotten how to relax. In the tent, it gradually dawned on herunconscious mind that there was no need to hurry. Quite suddenly, her mindrelaxed and her tensions dissolved away. It was a trick Crowley had firstlearned years ago on a long train journey from New York to Mexico City. Headmits that he has always found journeys of more than half an hour tedious, andthat even travelling from Edinburgh to Inverness he often felt on the verge ofinsanity. But after two or three days on the train, the boredom had vanished andhe felt completely relaxed.Since Jane was unsuitable (either for sexual or masochistic purposes) Crowleyhad to fall back on Leah. Two days after Jane's arrival, the diary contains along entry in which Crowley bares his breast and admits his shortcomings. Itseemed that:…the first hour of my vow of Holy Obedience to Alostrael [Leah] proved Her to bethe Scarlet Woman; she could have used her power in trivial ways; but She spranginstantly to Goddess-stature…First, She discovered the physical cowardice anddread of pain which I had sunk [i.e. buried] so deep by means of daringdeath-mountains…She held a lighted cigarette against my breast. I shrank andmoaned. She spat her scorn and puffed at it and put it back. I shrank andmoaned. She made me fold my arms, sucked at the paper until the tobacco crackledwith the fierceness of its burning; she put it back for the third time. I bracedmyself; I tightened lip and thrust my breast against it.Leah apparently saw through all his bluffs—saw that his erudition was a fake,that ‘my worship was half pose, my miracle half craft’. She called his bluff anddemanded the ‘Eucharist’—that Crowley should eat her excrement, which lay on theconsecrated plate on the altar. Crowley finally obeyed:My mouth burned; my throat choked; my belly retched, my blood fled whither whoknows, and my skin sweated. She stood above me, hideous in contempt…’ [And headmits]: Simple enough, all this: in a word, I'm a Coward and a Liar.The next morning, his tongue and throat were still sore.The warm season was, on the whole, pleasant and peaceful, although drugs wereweakening Crowley's health—he even had bronchitis in the middle of summer. Lifewith his concubines alternated between orgies of love and orgies of screaming—onone occasion Ninette threatened him with a revolver. The baby Poupée wassick—she had never been strong since birth. Oddly enough, Crowley had turnedinto a doting father. When the baby died in mid-October, he was shattered, andLeah, who was six months pregnant, had a miscarriage a few days later. ‘I canonly say that my brain was benumbed. It was dead except in one part where slowlyrevolved a senseless wheel of pain.’ It was Leah who revived his courage andconvinced him that he must live in the present, ‘wholly absorbed in the GreatWork’. He decided to go to Paris for a magical retirement. There he was overcomewith grief, which became acute when he passed the hospital where Poupée had beenborn. But in the forest of Fontainebleau, ‘the universal sorrow of natureflooded me and I broke out into strong sobbing.’ Finally, the misery exorcised,he went back to Paris.It was there that he met the mathematician and music critic J. W. N. Sullivan,who was travelling with a beautiful girl called Sylvia, a talented musician.Sullivan had acquired her from a literary critic, who had warned him that shesuffered from one curious drawback; some lack of self-confidence that made herincapable of being happy. Sullivan had already discovered that this was true,and that it made their lives together oddly pointless. Predictably, Sylvia wasfascinated by Crowley's powerful presence. He and Sullivan played chesstogether, talked all night, and discussed the law of Thelema; Sullivan ended bypledging himself to discover his True Will and to do it. Crowley then advisedhim to go off on his own to try and discover it, and rushed Sylvia off to hisbed. He claims in the autobiography that Sullivan asked him ‘point blank to takeher off his hands for a time’. At all events, Sylvia became pregnant. As theymade their way back to Cefalu, Sullivan demanded that Crowley return her, andCrowley, probably greatly relieved, promptly handed her over—to Sylvia's fury.Sylvia was to die shortly afterwards of typhoid, and Sullivan was to begin hiswriting career with a book in which he attempted to understand the meaning ofthe tragedy—the autobiography But for the Grace of God, which was to become aminor classic. He makes no mention of Sylvia's affair with Crowley.Back in the abbey, Crowley's health continued to deteriorate and he sufferedfrom boredom. He made an effort to break the heroin habit, and experiencedconstipation, sleeplessness and a return of his asthma.The abbey now had a new recruit, a young American named Cecil Frederick Russell,who had read Crowley's articles for an American magazine and introduced himselfto him in New York. Russell had been thrown out of the navy after taking fortygrains of cocaine and trying to set a piece of glass on fire with will power. Hehad arrived just before Crowley left for Paris, and although Crowley welcomedhim, hoping to seduce him—or rather, persuade Russell to seduce him—the newrecruit proved to be more trouble than he was worth. Like Crowley, he had apathological hatred of authority, and reacted with rage to anything that soundedlike an order; he had attacked Leah twice in Crowley's absence. When anothermember of the OTO (Frank Bennett) was due to arrive, and Crowley asked Russellto give up his room, he met with a flat refusal. He finally had to order Russellto give up his room or leave the abbey—a sad expedient for a born anarchist likeCrowley. When Russell's moods became a nuisance, Crowley suggested a magicalretirement, and Russell hurried off to the top of the great rock of Cefalu andtook a vow to starve for eight days. While there, he became convinced that hehad been initiated into a higher grade than Crowley's, and came down moreunstable than ever. They all heaved a sigh of relief when he finally left forAustralia, even though Crowley reproached himself for his failure to cureRussell of his ‘complex.’By contrast, the case of Sir Frank Bennett was a triumph. Bennett was aLancashire bricklayer who had joined the A.A. and the OTO, then emigrated toAustralia. Now—like Sullivan's mistress Sylvia—he felt that he was totallyunable to discover his True Will. The failure had profoundly depressed him. Oneday, as Crowley, Bennett and Leah were walking down to the beach, Crowleyproceeded to expound his own Thelemite psychology. ‘I want to explain to youwhat the Real Self is.’ What he said was basically a variation on Freud. Thesubconscious mind is our true self, the Holy Guardian Angel, which experiencesall that happens to us. It then does its best to persuade consciousness to actin accordance with its desires and needs; but consciousness, under the influenceof society, is inclined to ignore or repress this advice. Sex is mankind'sstrongest need, and no amount of repression can prevent it from expressingitself. Freedom, said Crowley, consists in learning to stop suppressing thesubconscious mind, and instead, learning to do its will.For some reason, this simplistic and Freudian view electrified Bennett, whorushed downhill and plunged into the sea. After the swim, he asked in an awedvoice: ‘Please tell me again what you said just now.’ Crowley had somedifficulty in remembering, but finally succeeded. Bennett listened in silence,and when they came back to the abbey, went into a trance that lasted for threedays. (This is Crowley's account; according to Bennett, he wandered about themountain in a state of delirious torment before his mind grew calm.) Then hecame to Crowley looking like ‘an incarnation of pure joy’, and told him that hehad given him the key to the inmost treasury of his soul. What Crowley had done,said Bennett, was to teach him that doing his true will merely consisted inlistening to the voice of his subconscious mind and doing what it directs. So,Bennett concluded triumphantly, Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the lawis true.The reason for Bennett's excitement may not be immediately obvious; after all,Crowley had merely repeated the standard Freudian theory on sex, and had—ineffect—told Bennett to ‘let it all hang out.’ But he had also grasped thatBennett's central problem was a confusion about the nature of his ‘true will.’Bennett was a self-made man, a man who was used to taking conscious decisionsand carrying them out. But he was also a deeply dissatisfied man, driven by afeeling that there had to be more in life than mere ‘success’—hence hismembership of the A.A. and the OTO. Yet the conscious will that had brought himmaterial success seemed incapable of fulfilling his deepest needs. In tellinghim to listen to the voice of the subconscious, Crowley had shown him anotherway out: to stop willing and relax. It is unlikely that Bennett really went intoa trance for three days. What is far more probable is that he was doingprecisely what Crowley told him to do: sinking into a state of quiescence—likeJane Wolfe—and listening to an inner voice, of whose existence he had suddenlybecome aware.So one man, at least, saw Crowley as he saw himself: as the great teacher andliberator. Bennett wrote in his journal:Twelve years ago I first saw the Beast, then I decided, half-heartedly, tofollow him. But since I have seen him, and lived in the Abbey with him I haveseen something. If his inner life; and his great disappointment, not with hiswork, but with those who ought to be carrying out his work…I am determined heshall not be disappointed in me; for I will spend the rest of my life inspreading his teaching. I may not be able to do much. But by the help of him,the Beast, and of my own Real Self, which he had given me an insight of—I may domuch. For he alone led me to the knowledge of my real subconscious self…3[part0011.html#fnr3]It is too easy to see Crowley as an overgrown juvenile delinquent with a passionfor self-advertisement. But there was another Crowley, the Crowley recognizedand admired by Frank Bennett. Unless we understand this, we totally fail tograsp the extraordinary influence that Crowley could exert on women like Roseand Leah, and on men like Neuburg, Sullivan and Bennett. They came to believethat Crowley was exactly what he claimed to be: a great teacher, the messiah ofa new age. And this was not the gullibility of born dupes; Sullivan, at least,was one of the most intelligent men of his age (as his book on Beethovenreveals). Crowley was, in part, a great teacher, a man of profound insights.Mencius says: ‘Those who follow the part of themselves that is great will becomegreat men; those who follow the part of themselves that is small will becomesmall men.’ But Crowley was a strange mixture who devoted about equal time tofollowing both parts of himself, and so became a curious combination ofgreatness and smallness. A summary of his life, and his extraordinary goings-on,makes us aware of the smallness; but it would be sheer short-sightedness tooverlook the element of greatness that so impressed Bennett.Other visitors to the abbey were Ninette's two sisters, Mimi (her twin) andHelen, as well as the novelist Mary Butts, and her lover Cecil Maitland. Crowleywas impressed by Maitland's intelligence, but made the penetrating observation:The great value of such men as Maitland and Neuburg to me has been to strengthenmy conviction that in the absence of willpower the most complete collection ofvirtues and talents is wholly worthless. You must have a fulcrum, not only tomove the world, but to move a feather.Mimi was deeply impressed by Crowley, and only prevented from joining the abbeyby her middle class upbringing. Helen, on the other hand, loathed Crowley andall he stood for, without having the strength of personality to tell him so tohis face. She tried to influence the children—or ‘corrupt’ them, as Crowley sawit—and when Crowley found out, he ordered her to leave. Helen then went to theBritish consul in Palermo and ‘swore to a long list of lies.’ But, claimsCrowley, she could only think of one thing that was actually illegal—Crowleydoes not specify what it was—and the police called at the abbey and could findno evidence. Possibly Helen had complained about an act of intercourse betweenthe Scarlet Woman and a billy goat, which had culminated in Crowley cutting theanimal's throat—possibly because it had shown an insulting lack of enthusiasmfor the operation. Whatever it was, it had the unfortunate effect of drawing theattention of the law to the Abbey of Do-What-You-Will.Crowley had spent the legacy that had enabled him to move to Cefalu; now it wasnecessary to think of ways of earning money. This would obviously be impossiblein Cefalu; so in January 1922, he went back to Fontainebleau. Drugs hadundermined his health, and the magical diary is full of accounts of hismiseries. A disciple named Augustine Booth-Clibborn seemed to hold out a promiseof renewed fortune, but he declined to sign Crowley's solemn pledge to undertakethe Great Work—perhaps alarmed by Crowley's demands for money—and vanished.Crowley found Paris oddly disappointing. ‘All the old enchantments had somehowvanished.’ So he recovered some clothes he had left at the cleaners in 1914,donned highland costume, and set out with Leah for London. He had only £10 inhis pocket, and was greatly amused when he was mistaken for a financier wantedfor embezzlement and arrested near Boulogne; he was able to prove his identityby showing the police his photograph in Guillarmod's book on the Chogo-Riexpedition.In London, his luck took a turn for the better. The novelist J. D. Beresford,the literary adviser of the publisher William Collins, succeeded in gettingCrowley a contract for a novel to be called The Diary of a Drug Fiend. It wasCrowley's first venture into commercial authorship, all his earlier books havingbeen published at his own expense. He dictated the novel to Leah, who took itdown in longhand, in twenty-seven and a half days, at a rate of just under fivethousand words per day.For a month's labour, Diary of a Drug Fiend is rather an impressive piece ofwork: the story of an ex-airman named Sir Peter Pendragon who becomes a heroinaddict, and is saved by a meeting with ‘Mr King Lamus’ (Crowley) who invites himto his Abbey of Thelema at Telepylus, and cures him. It is unashamedly a roman àclef, and John Symonds’ edition4 [part0011.html#fnr4] has footnotes identifyingalmost all the characters. Pendragon is based on Cecil Maitland, and in theopening chapter, which takes place in the Café Royal, we meet Frank Harris, LordAlfred Douglas, Augustus John, Jacob Epstein and many others, including Crowley,who introduces himself to Pendragon with the words ‘Do what thou wilt shall bethe whole of the law’—one of Crowley's more tiresome habits. Each of thecharacters is introduced with a thumbnail sketch. Mary Butts is a ‘fat, bold redheaded slut’ who reminds the hero of a white maggot. Lord Alfred Douglas givesan impression ‘of some filthy creature of the darkness—a raider from anotherworld looking about him for something to despoil’, while the journalist T. W. H.Crosland is ‘a huge bloated, verminous creature like a cockroach…his facebloated and pimpled, a horrible evil leer on his dripping mouth, with itsfurniture like a bombed graveyard.’This acidulous way of descibing his characters is strongly reminiscent ofFrederick Rolfe, ‘Baron Corvo’, the virulent, frustrated homosexual who wroteHadrian the Seventh; it also has much in common with the method of Wyndham Lewisin novels like The Apes of God. And these comparisons are highly revealing. BothRolfe and Lewis were bad novelists because they were so self-absorbed that theytotally lacked the kind of objectivity that comes naturally to a born novelist;they were simply unable to get outside their own skins. Shaw once said that ourinterest in the world is the overflow of our interest in ourselves, and thatuntil our interest in ourselves has been satisfied, we find it hard to payattention to the world. Most people outgrow this stage in childhood oradolescence; but Crowley, like Rolfe and Lewis, never succeeded in satisfyingthe appetite, and remained in this state of self-absorption all his life.Equally striking is the unselfconscious way in which Crowley can paint animmensely self-magnified portrait of himself in King Lamus (in fact, a characterin Homer's Odyssey who rules over the cannibal giants, the Laestrygonians).Inevitably, Crowley produces the impression that, since nobody else is willingto blow his trumpet, he will do it himself. Diary of a Drug Fiend is an accuratemeasure of the immense, unsatisfied craving for recognition that dogged Crowleyfrom youth to old age. It also explains why the British, when they finallybecame aware of Crowley, rejected him with such finality; his temperament wasthe reverse of everything the British admire. But for Crowley, the commissioningof the Diary of a Drug Fiend seemed a turning point in his life, the reward fromthe gods foretold by his guardian angel. And, to some extent, this view seemedto be justified. Collins accepted it immediately, and went on to commissionCrowley's autobiography for an advance of £120—twice as much as they had paid onDrug Fiend. When Drug Fiend appeared, in November 1922—complete with a noteexplaining that the Abbey of Thelema really existed, and that the author wouldbe glad to hear from prospective disciples—it was not greeted with the howls ofderision that Crowley's smug self-portrait might have provoked. Critics found ita little too verbose, but gave Crowley high marks for good intentions indenouncing the use of heroin. When Crowley returned to Cefalu later that month,it looked as if he might anticipate a modest but continuous income from the useof his pen—he had also contracted with Collins to publish a series of storiesabout a detective called Simon Iff, and with another publisher to translate TheKey to the Mysteries by Crowley's earlier incarnation, Eliphas Lévi.Then the Sunday Express launched an attack on Drug Fiend; the author was JamesDouglas, the weekly columnist whom Lord Beaverbrook paid to be a kind ofguardian of morality. He had already attacked Joyce's Ulysses and AldousHuxley's Antic Hay, thereby greatly increasing their circulation (just as hissuccessor, John Gordon, launched Nabokov to fame by denouncing Lolita). Crowleywas not quite so lucky. The Express realized he was good copy, and the followingSunday followed up the attack with an interview with Mary Butts, describing‘profligacy and vice’ in the Abbey of Thelema—she was presumably getting her ownback for Crowley's attack on her Drug Fiend. The Express smacked its lips overstories of ‘bestial orgies’, and another friend of Crowley's, a woman namedBetty Bickers—with whom he had stayed in London—revealed that he had borrowedmoney from her. Collins (Crowley's publisher) had been delighted with the JamesDouglas article, which could only increase sales. But the ‘exposure’ of theorgies and depravities was another matter; Collins published the Bible and otherimproving works, and to go on selling Drug Fiend after these attacks would betantamount to profiting by the wages of sin. So they quietly allowed Drug Fiendto drop out of print.Crowley's reaction to all this, in the final chapter of his autobiography, istypical; he finds the attitude of his publisher, ‘inexcusable’, and argues thatthe principles of fair play should be applied to ‘cases which involve thesuspicion of sexual irregularity.’ The implication is clearly that he had beenunjustly accused; Leah's copulation with the billy goat, and other similarepisodes of sex magic, are conveniently forgotten.In retrospect, it certainly looks as if Crowley had become the victim of amalign fate. He was correct to believe that Drug Fiend would mark a turningpoint in his life; but in his worst nightmares, could hardly have imagined itwould be quite such a disastrous one. It is true that he might have takenwarning from that earlier episode in 1910 when George Cecil Jones sued TheLooking Glass, and the whole thing blew up in his face. But on that occasion, hehad at least been more or less innocent. On the present occasion, he hadprovoked the attack by writing a vainglorious novel, and by using it as anopportunity to work off his malice against ‘friends’ like Mary Butts and CecilMaitland. Mary Butts—actually a writer of considerable merit—may or may not haveintended to ruin Crowley when she gave the Sunday Express interview; butCrowley's sketch of her as ‘pompous, pretentious and stupid’ and the author of‘the most deplorably dreary drivel’ certainly gave her the right to aim a blowin return. As it happened, it went home with devastating accuracy.Back in the Abbey, Crowley was not yet aware of the extent of the disaster. Hewas looking forward to the arrival of a new disciple, Raoul Loveday, a brilliantyoung Oxford man, to whom he had been introduced by Betty Bickers. Loveday hadbeen studying The Equinox for two years before he met Crowley in the summer of1922. Like Crowley, Loveday was a born anti-authoritarian. At Oxford, clamberingover a wall to escape the proctors, he had transfixed his thigh on a spike andalmost died. The same rebelliousness may explain his marriage to a Soho artist'smodel named Betty May, who had already been married twice before—Crowley saysshe was an alcoholic, a drug-addict and a prostitute (‘an artist's model of themost vicious kind’) as well as being brain-damaged; but then, Crowley had goodreason to hate her. When Loveday was taken (alone) to meet Crowley, he stayedaway for three days, and returned—by climbing a drain pipe—stinking of ether.For Crowley, it seemed that this was the disciple he had been seeking since thedefection of Neuburg—intelligent, handsome (in a weak kind of way) and alreadydevoted to the Beast. He lost no time in inviting the Lovedays to join him inCefalu.Betty May, who later described the whole episode in her autobiography TigerWoman, was dismayed to find that the Abbey of Thelema was a grubby farmhousewithout sanitation or running water, and most of whose inhabitants seemed tohave an objection to washing. (Jane Wolfe had already described Leah as ‘filthpersonified.’) Loveday, on the other hand, was delighted with everything he saw;he described in his diary waking the first morning to the throb of a tom-tom,and joining the others on the olive-green hill for their invocation to therising sun. ‘I cannot express my feeling of exaltation as I stood there inhalingthe sweet morning air…’ Then he and Crowley wrote all morning, and had a lunchof meat, fruit and sharp Sicilian wine. In the afternoon they climbed the greatrock. When they returned, there was high tea and a magic ritual, followed by areading from Crowley. Then talk, chess and mandolin playing until bedtime atnine. For Loveday it was literally a magical idyll.His wife found it all strange and nasty. She used to wash naked at the pump inthe early morning until she discovered Crowley leering at her from round acorner. Observation of the children soon convinced her they were spoiltbrats—the five year old smoked incessantly, and told her that he was BeastNumber Two and could ‘shatter her.’ Crowley allowed them to witness the sexrites, believing it would keep them free from repressions. No one in the abbeywas allowed to use the word ‘I’—they had to say ‘one’. For every transgressionthey had to slash their forearms with a razor (there exists an earlierphotograph of Neuburg's slashed forearms). And when Crowley did his dance ofdionysian frenzy, Betty found it impressive, but funny.But Crowley and Loveday were ill of some liver complaint much of the time(probably hepatitis) and medical attention was less thorough than it ought tohave been due to Crowley's failure to pay the doctor. The climax came afterthree months in an episode involving the sacrifice of a cat. The animal hadscratched Crowley when he tried to throw it out of the room, and when he againfound it in the scullery he made the sign of the pentagram over it with hismagic staff and ordered it to remain there until the hour of sacrifice. The catdid just that; it refused food, and when Betty May carried it outside, it cameback to the same place. Finally, the ceremony was performed. Loveday, as a highpriest, had to kill the cat. Invocations went on for two hours, then Raoul tooka kukri—a big Gurka knife—and went towards the squirming sack on the altar. Whenhe slashed the cat's throat, it escaped and ran round the room howling. It hadto be anaesthetised before Loveday could complete the sacrifice. Then Leah helda bowl under the throat to catch the blood. Crowley dipped his finger in theblood and traced the pentagram on Loveday's forehead, after which he handedLoveday a silver cup of the blood, which the high priest drained to the lastdrop. Loveday's enteritis later became worse, and he took to his bed. Crowleycast his horoscope and looked grim; he announced that it was possible thatLoveday might die on 16 February, at 4 o'clock. Two days later, when he foundBetty May reading a newspaper as she sat by her husband's bedside, Crowleysnatched it from her—newspapers were forbidden in the abbey, on the grounds that‘having a library of first class books we should not spoil our appetites byeating between meals, especially the filth of the streets’. Betty began smashingthings and threw glasses and jugs at Crowley's head; the sick Loveday had tostagger out of bed to defend his master. After that Betty left and went to ahotel; she had to be persuaded to return—after a promise of future good conduct.But Raoul's condition suddenly took a turn for the worst. At exactly the timeforecast by Crowley, he died.There was an impressive burial ceremony. Then Betty May left. Jane Wolfe alsowent to London, to try and raise funds and more disciples. And only nine daysafter Loveday's death, the Sunday Express carried a headline: NEW SINISTERREVELATIONS OF ALEISTER CROWLEY. Betty May described in details scenes of‘drugs, magic and vile practices’. John Bull followed up the attack, evenaccusing Crowley of cannibalism when in Kashmir. Crowley was ill in bed at thetime—he had collapsed after the funeral. Now, perhaps feeling himself in need ofmoral support, he wrote off to another disciple, Norman Mudd, a youngmathematical student who had unsuccessfully defied the Dean of Trinity onCrowley's behalf in 1909. At that time, Mudd had finally caved in to thepressure of the authorities, and had reproached himself for being a coward eversince. According to Crowley, ‘shame dogged him by day and haunted him by night’,and ten years after moving to South Africa, he had returned to England to searchfor the man who had impressed him so deeply. Hearing that Crowley was inAmerica, Mudd had gone to Chicago, and succeeded in contacting Crowley's‘magical son’ Jones, who had initiated him into the A.A. Now, at the summons ofthe Master, Mudd hurried to Cefalu eager to take over where Loveday had leftoff. He arrived on 20 April 1923.A few days later, Crowley was summoned to the police station in Cefalu, and toldthat he had been ordered by Italy's new ruler, Mussolini, to leave Italianterritory immediately. On 1 May, shadowed by a detective, Crowley and hisScarlet Woman left the Abbey of Thelema for Tunis.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0011.html#fn1].

Ever since he had been a teenager, Crowley had believed that he was agreat poet, an original thinker, a ‘man of power’. The world had never shown theslightest sign of agreeing with him, so as time went by, Crowley's claims togenius became increasingly strident. He tried seriousness, he tried humour, hetried irony, he tried sarcasm, he even tried obscenity; the world continued toact as if he didn't exist. He published his collected works; he even published abook declaring himself the greatest man of his generation. That should havebrought some response; in fact, it was hardly noticed. Yet writers like Shaw,Wells, Chesterton, and Yeats, seem to have had no difficulty whatever makingthemselves heard. There must have been times when Crowley felt like theinvisible man. Even his most outrageous behaviour was ignored.Then, all at once, the world noticed his existence—and reacted with a cry ofdisgust, as if it had trodden on a slug. It was like one of those fairy taleswhere the bad fairy grants a wish—but in a manner guaranteed to cause disaster.His craving to become known was granted in full measure—but at the cost ofuniversal loathing. He was not even a ‘figure of controversy’—like Ibsen orZola—for he had no defenders. John Bull ran headlines like THE KING OFDEPRAVITY, A HUMAN BEAST and A MAN WE'D LIKE TO HANG, and the British publicagreed with every word. It was also John Bull that coined the title that Crowleywas to drag around like a ball and chain for the rest of his life: the wickedestman in the world. With a soubriquet like that, his chances of being takenseriously as a poet, a thinker, or even an anti-establishment rebel, werenon-existent.To say that Crowley had no defenders is not, perhaps, quite accurate: he hadone, Norman Mudd. Mudd was a short, ugly, snub-nosed man who had lost an eyethrough a venereal infection, and he had been devoted to Crowley—in a doglike,adoring way—ever since that meeting at Cambridge in 1909. He and Ninette stayedon at the abbey and Mudd wrote off letters to newspapers defending Crowley. Inone of these, published in the Oxford student magazine Isis he asserts thatCrowley's ‘ideals are noble his honour stainless, and his life devoted wholly tothe service of mankind’. He also calls Crowley England's ‘greatest poet’. But hefails to explain why, if all the accusations against Crowley are ‘baselessfalsehoods’, they came to be made in the first place.Crowley had settled in a cheap hotel in the Arab quarter of Tunis. He had stillnot grasped the extent of his unpopularity. In any case, his attention wascompletely occupied by the problems posed by his addiction to heroin andcocaine; he was sleeping badly and vomiting, and had bad attacks ofdyspnoea—difficulty in breathing. The magical diary lacks the usual entries onsex magic—presumably his health was too poor—and he was angry with Leah forrefusing to wake him in the morning by getting into his bed and caressing him.He seems to be suffering from odd illusions about himself: ‘If a man fucks awoman he admires her aesthetically…When a man fucks me I want to know it is formy beauty.’ But he confesses to having lost interest in sex.In June he made a remarkable attempt to break himself of the heroinhabit—admittedly with the help of ether. He admits to having taken an averagedose of three grains a day for more than two years. His ‘cold turkey’ treatmentcaused diarrhoea, vomiting, shortness of breath and delirium, but withimpressive will power he persisted for three days, until on the fourth day he‘woke fresh, strong and well’ and felt ten years younger. But two days later, hewas back on heroin and cocaine. Much of the ‘autohagiography’—as he liked tocall the Confessions (a hagiography being the life of a saint)—was written underthe influence of drugs.Mudd arrived on 20 June 1923, and Crowley left him with Leah in the cheap hotelwhile he himself went off for a ‘magical retirement’ to the best hotel in Tunis,probably with money borrowed from Mudd. While he was there, the unexpectedhappened and Mudd and Leah fell in love. They told Crowley when he returned;Mudd even suggested marrying Leah, on the curious grounds that if she was hiswife, she could then live up to her name of the Whore of Babylon by sleepingwith Crowley. Crowley disagreed, and packed Mudd off to a ‘magical retirement’in a nearby village. Crowley's sex desires were now reviving—perhaps because hehad acquired himself a negro boy named Mohammed—and soon, he and Leah, withMohammed in attendance, went off on their own magical retirement into thedesert—hiring a camel for that purpose. Crowley and Mohammed performed sexmagic; but when Crowley fell ill, Mohammed and Leah practised sex magic withouthis help. Finally, Mohammed and Leah fell ill too, and all three returned toTunis. Crowley felt that his magical current was exhausted, for the time being.He wrote to the proprietor of a hotel in Paris where he had stayed before thewar, assuring him that The Diary of a Drug Fiend had been an immense success,and that he would soon be able to pay the bill he had left owing in 1914; theproprietor agreed to allow him to come and stay on credit. So Crowley tookwhatever money was available—leaving Mudd and Leah penniless—and sailed off toMarseilles; he stayed in Nice with Frank Harris, who managed to borrow fivehundred francs for Crowley's train fare, and then went on to Paris. There hestayed in the Hotel de Blois, and did his best to convince himself that allthese adversities were part of the plan of the Secret Chiefs.Mudd and Leah eventually managed to rejoin him in Paris by pawning Crowley'smagic ring. When Frank Harris wrote to ask for a return on his five hundredfrancs, Crowley wrote him a long letter explaining why repayment was impossible,and then put before him ‘the deepest conviction of his soul’ that, rotten as hewas in a thousand ways, he had nevertheless been chosen by the gods toinaugurate the new post-Christian era on earth. Capitalism, he said, was doomed,but Bolshevism was no real alternative. (Crowley had written to Trotsky fromTunis, asking to be put in charge of the extirpation of Christianity on earth,but had no reply.) The true answer lay in Crowleyanity, and if only Harris wouldbecome a Believer, his own troubles would be over…Meanwhile, a new proprietor of his lodgings had decided to evict him; Crowleypronounced a solemn curse, and soon after, the hotel went bankrupt. An effort toput a magical curse on Lord Beaverbrook and the Sunday Express seems to havebeen less successful. Mudd wrote a long open letter to Beaverbrook, and wasdespatched to London to distribute it. There he was forced to seek shelter inthe Metropolitan Asylum for the Homeless Poor. Crowley, who always managed tofall on his feet, had meanwhile succeeded in borrowing money from friends likeSullivan and Jones, and was living fairly well in Paris. He and Leah moved to ahotel at Chellessur-Marne, and there he was sought out by yet anotherself-divided female in search of a Master: Dorothy Olsen, an American. Crowleylost no time in accepting her as a probationer of the A.A, under the name ofSister Astrid. It then struck Crowley that a Scarlet Woman with a bank accountwas a more logical companion for the future Messiah than a Scarlet Woman who wasa financial burden. So he explained to Leah that the Secret Chiefs had ordaineda magical retirement in North Africa, during which he should be accompanied onlyby Dorothy Olsen. When Norman Mudd returned from his unsuccessful attempt torehabilitate Crowley in London, he found Leah penniless and half-starved. Thetwo declared themselves married as a result of a private magical ceremony, andLeah became a prostitute to support her new husband.Crowley was now on a three months magical retirement in North Africa with hisnew scarlet woman—who was presumably paying the bills. At one point a sheikrecognized Crowley as a Secret Master and entertained him to a feast. But thestrain of being a Whore of Babylon became too much for Dorothy, who began toexhibit the same signs of neurosis as Leah and other previous holders of theoffice—for example, abusing Crowley as a scoundrel. Yet when Dorothy foundherself pregnant, Leah gave up her job as a potato-peeler in a restaurant andhurried to Tunis to help with the confinement; the journey proved unnecessary,for Dorothy miscarried.And now, once again, Crowley's luck turned. His guardian angel had prophesiedthe arrival of a rich man from the west who would pour his gold upon Crowley.Now Crowley heard that Theodore Reuss, German head of the OTO, had resigned hisposition after a stroke. The acting head, Heinrich Tränker, had had a vision inwhich he saw Crowley as the head of a group of Secret Chiefs. He therefore wroteto Crowley, inviting him to a conference of the OTO in Germany. The fares wouldbe paid by a wealthy member named Karl Germer. The result was that Crowley,Leah, Mudd and Dorothy Olsen set out for Thuringia, Crowley having sent a copyof The Book of the Law ahead of him. This was a rash move; when Tränker read itsjuvenile blasphemies, he was appalled; he thought the book was demoniacallyinspired. Fortunately, Tränker then had another vision that changed his mind; henow declared that the book could be summarized in one word, civilization.Crowley's reaction to this curious assessment is unknown.The German OTO was by no means unanimous in accepting Crowley as its new head.In fact, it finally split into three groups. One, led by Tränker, totallyrejected Crowley. Another, led by a man named Eugen Grosche, accepted Crowley asan important teacher, but declined to regard him as a Secret Chief. The third,whose most important member was Karl Germer, swallowed Crowleyanity lock, stockand barrel. And for the next ten years or so, Germer continued to be Crowley'smain financial support. As usual, the Beast had fallen on his feet.Norman Mudd and Leah Hirsig now vanish from the story. When writing The GreatBeast in 1949, John Symonds took the trouble to find out what had happened tothem. Leah, he learned, had tried to live up to the doctrines of The Book of theLaw—which she regarded as more important than Crowley—but was finally disownedby Crowley, who informed other members of the OTO to refuse all contact withher. She returned to America—whence her son had already been taken by sisterAlma—and became a school teacher again. For this reason, Symonds disguised heridentity under the name Leah Faesi in The Great Beast. She died in 1951. NormanMudd also turned against Crowley, whom he believed to have betrayed the SecretMasters, and at one stage announced himself to be the new World Teacher.Symonds’ enquiries elicited the fact that he had committed suicide on thechannel island of Guernsey in June 1934, walking into the sea with bicycle clipson the bottoms of his trousers and the legs and pockets filled with stones.Now once again solvent—thanks to Germer—Crowley installed himself once more inParis. Symonds confesses with a sigh: ‘A list of Crowley's mistresses at thistime will get us nowhere.’ But he quotes a letter from Karl Germer's wife toCrowley in which she complains: ‘The $15,000 I have given you were spent not inreal constructive work but in expensive cigars, cognac, cocktails, taxi's,dinners, wives and sweethearts, or anything you desired at the moment…GodAlmighty himself would not be as arrogant as you have been, and that is one ofthe causes of all your troubles.’ It was a perceptive comment.Like Norman Mudd, Crowley's ‘magical son’ Jones (Frater Achad) also began tosuffer from delusions. He returned to England and became a Catholic convert—notbecause he had abandoned the doctrines of Aiwas, but because he hoped to convertthe Catholic Church to the Book of the Law. Failing in this endeavour, hereturned to Vancouver and was arrested for flinging off a raincoat and revealinghimself naked underneath. Crowley expelled him from the Order.In 1926, Crowley began to store up more trouble for himself by entering intocorrespondence with a young man from Philadelphia, Francis Israel Regardie, whohad read Crowley's classic on yoga Book Four. Crowley advised Regardie tocontact Karl Germer, who was now living in New York, and Germer sold Regardie aset of the Equinox. In October 1928, Regardie sailed for France to becomeCrowley's secretary. But his sister had meanwhile looked into the Equinox, beenhorrified by its attitude to sex, and begged the French consul to deny herbrother a visa. This was impossible—it had already been granted—but the consulreferred the matter to Paris for investigation. Meanwhile, Regardie arrived inParis and was met by Crowley; he moved into a flat at 55 Avenue de Suffren withCrowley and his latest Scarlet Woman, a flamboyant Nicaraguan lady named Mariade Miramar. Crowley had also acquired another well-off disciple, Gerald Yorke;Regardie confesses that both he and Yorke were nervous in case Crowley tried‘some homosexual monkey tricks’, but apparently neither had any reason foralarm. The French police, alerted by the New York consul, proceeded toinvestigate Crowley, and learned of his expulsion from Cefalu and of hisdrug-taking; in March 1929, Crowley, Regardie and Maria de Miramar were orderedto leave France forthwith. Crowley managed to delay his expulsion by pleadingillness, but Regardie and the Scarlet Woman had to leave. They were not allowedto land in England—although Regardie had been born there—but had to awaitCrowley in Brussels. Crowley himself left France in a blaze of publicity in thefollowing month; since his expulsion from Sicily, he had been a subject ofintense interest to the world's press. He managed to secure a British passportfor Maria by the simple expedient of marrying her. Then he and Regardie wereable to resume their work, this time at Knockholt, in Kent. Regardie recordsthat when Gerald Yorke came to visit, Crowley would play them both simultaneoulyat blindfold chess, sitting with his back to them in an armchair, and callingout the moves; he would always beat them both. The story reveals how much skillin ‘visualization’ Crowley had achieved through his studies of magic.Crowley had now completed what many regard as his major work, Magick in Theoryand Practice, basically a sequel to the earlier Book Four. Gerald Yorke and KarlGermer paid for its publication in Paris—no English publisher would touch it,perhaps because Crowley recommended sacrificing a male child to achieve the bestmagical results, and added a footnote to the effect that he himself had done soabout a hundred and fifty times a year between 1912 and 1928. And even in this,his major work, Crowley was unable to resist the temptation to indulge insadistic practical joking; a practising magician explained to the present writerthat the book was ‘booby trapped’—that is, that certain ‘deliberate mistakes’have been included in its magic rituals. To the non-occultist this may soundharmless enough. But it is a basic part of the magical tradition that demonicentities are sticklers for precision and accuracy, and that the smallest slipcan bring disaster. Crowley obviously liked the idea of some neophyte magicianpronouncing magic spells in a graveyard by moonlight, and being possessed bysome sinister entity from ‘beyond the threshold’.It is a measure of Crowley's total lack of realism that he believed that Magickwould finally establish his reputation with the general public (he explains thathe has written it ‘to help the banker, the pugilist…the grocer, the factorygirl…’ etc.). In fact, it was not even noticed by reviewers.Things looked slightly more promising for the ‘auto-hagiography.’ He discovereda small press in Museum Street, Mandrake Press, run by Edward Goldston. Collinshad, of course, lost interest in the book after the Sunday Express attacks; inJune 1929, Crowley signed a contract with Mandrake Press, with an advance of£50. Goldston's partner, an Australian named P. R. Stephenson, was a greatadmirer of Crowley, and was engaged in writing a defense of the much-malignedmagician—although this was not so much a labour of love as a businessprecaution, designed to break down sales resistance to Crowley's Confessions andto his witchcraft novel Moonchild (written in New Orleans in 1917). Regrettably,Crowley's reputation was so unsavoury that none of these books made any impact.Moonchild appeared later in 1929, accompanied by a note that begins:This entrancing story, by one of the most mysterious and brilliant of livingwriters, describes the magickal operation by which a spirit of the moon wasinvoked into the being of an expectant mother despite the machinations of theBlack Lodge of rival magicians…[And it ends, significantly]: Aleister Crowley'sfirst novel, The Diary of a Drug Fiend, was withdrawn from circulation after anattack in the sensational press.It is utterly typical of Crowley that when, in 1933, he saw a copy of Moonchildin a bookshop in Praed Street, with a card that stated: ‘Aleister Crowley'sfirst novel The Diary of a Drug Fiend was withdrawn from circulation after anattack in the sensational press’, he instantly sued the bookshop for libel,pointing out that the book had simply gone out of print, and won £50 damageswith costs. It seems a pity that the bookshop owner (a Mr Gray) did not have thepresence of mind to point out to the judge that he was quoting Crowley's ownwords from the blurb of Moonchild.When the first two volumes of the Confessions appeared in 1930 (it was designedto be published in six) the Mandrake salesman tried in vain to persuadebookshops to offer it for sale. The man who had committed ‘unutterableobscenities’ at his abbey in Sicily was too hot to handle. As far as the Britishpublic was concerned, he should have been in prison, not openly trying to peddlehis disgusting life story. The cover design, with its ‘idealized self-portrait’and signature whose initial letter was obviously an erect penis, must have putoff anyone who thought that ‘confessions’ implied some kind of repentance.images [../images/00002.gif]With regard to the Confessions and Moonchild, it must be admitted that, foronce, Crowley's attitude of injured innocence was justified. The Confessions maynot be comparable to Cellini, as Cammell suggests, but it is a fascinating book,and not even remotely obscene. Moonchild is a highly readable novel; two orthree decades later, it might have achieved a success like that of The Exorcistor Rosemary's Baby. The other small book published by Mandrake—The Stratagem andOther Stories—reads at times like a mixture of Borges and Lovecraft, andconfirms that Crowley was a born writer. These books were ignored simply becauseCrowley was Crowley—the ‘wickedest man in the world.’ And while his reputationwas certainly his own fault, it seems a pity that their very real merits wereignored. In any case, Crowley soon quarrelled with Gerald Yorke and KarlGermer—though in neither case was the break a permanent one—and Mandrake Pressceased to exist.Early in 1930, Crowley was asked to lecture at the Poetry Society at Oxford, andproposed to talk about Gilles de Rais, the fifteenth century child murderer,whom Crowley rightly described as a practitioner of black magic; the authoritiesbanned the lecture, and Crowley countered by having it printed as a pamphlet.When he tried to arrange an exhibition of his paintings, London art galleriesdeclined the honour; when he proposed to show them at another address, where hewas negotiating for the lease of a flat, the agent cancelled the lease. Soonafter this, he abandoned his wife Maria, went off to Berlin, and found himself anineteen year old mistress named Hanni Jaegar, whom he called the Monster. Laterthat year he went off to Spain with Hanni, and performed some spectacularoperations of sexual magic with her; but she grew sick of magic, and after aviolent quarrel, they were ordered to leave their hotel. After this, Hanni lefthim and fled back to Germany. Crowley decided to ‘annoy’ her by pretending tocommit suicide; so at a steep cliff called Hell's Mouth, near Cintra, he left asuicide note under his cigarette case. Then he hastened off in pursuit of Hanni.Impressed by his devotion, she again gave herself to him in Berlin. While theworld press speculated about his suicide, Crowley persuaded her to lodge aformal complaint—implying sexual harassment—against an American consul who hadbefriended her in Lisbon and advised her to go home. He was (as Regardie hadobserved) a man who could nurse a grudge for a long time. The speculation abouthim ceased when he appeared at the opening of an exhibition of his paintings inBerlin. But this piece of pointless exhibitionism only deepened the generalimpression that he was a man who would do anything for self-advertisement.In England, his wife Maria had become an alcoholic, then went insane and had tobe committed to Colney Hatch asylum. Crowley's plans to divorce her and marryHanni Jaegar were shelved when he met another Scarlet Woman named Billy Busch;Symonds’ account makes it clear that his relationship with her was astempestuous as the one with Leah had been. Gerald Hamilton—ChristopherIsherwood's ‘Mr Norris’—came back to the flat he was sharing with them one dayto find her drugged and tied up with ropes, while a note from Crowley orderedhim not to release her on any account.It was in May, 1933, that Crowley—as already mentioned—had sued a Praed Streetbookseller for advertising Moonchild with a note stating that Crowley's previousnovel had been withdrawn from circulation. When the judge awarded Crowley £50,his taste for litigation was whetted. Earlier in life he had wisely steeredclear of lawyers; now in perpetual need of money, he bitterly regretted notsuing Beaverbrook for the Sunday Express ‘libels.’ So when he came upon apassage in the autobiography of his old Soho friend Nina Hamnett, mentioningthat he was accused of practising black magic, Crowley saw another opportunityto raise the wind. He approached her and explained that they could both benefitfinancially if he won a case against her publisher, Constable and Co (of whomBernard Shaw was a main shareholder). How far she agreed to participate in thisunpleasant charade is not clear. At all events, Crowley began to look around forfriends to support him in court. J. W. N. Sullivan declined; so did Captain [nowMajor General] Fuller; so did the novelist J. D. Beresford, who had recommendedDrug Fiend for publication.Memories of the law case of 1910 should have warned Crowley that he was temptingthe fates. Even without the reputation of the wickedest man in the world, hecould not have expected heavy damages for the statement that ‘he was supposed tohave practised Black Magic’ in Cefalu. As it was, his decision to sue NinaHamnett was as rash as Wilde's decision to sue the Marquis of Queensberry forimplying he was a homosexual.When the trial opened, on 10 April 1934, Crowley soon made a bad impression withhis flippancy. Asked whether ‘Master Therion’—‘the Great Wild Beast’—was a fairexpression of his outlook on life, Crowley replied that it meant sunlight, andthat they could call him Little Sunshine. He denied that he had been defying allmoral conventions since his youth—a statement that may have been expedient butwas certainly a lie, and a denial of all his basic principles. Readings fromCrowley's erotic poetry shocked the court just as much as the prosecutingcounsel knew they would, and even Crowley's comment: ‘As you read it, it ismagnificent’ failed to lighten the atmosphere. When Betty May gave evidenceabout the death of her husband, Crowley's last hope of winning the caseevaporated. (He had taken the precaution of having some of her letters stolenfrom her, but they did him no good in court.) Finally, the judge could containhimself no longer; he interupted to say that in forty years in the legalprofession, he thought he had seen every form of wickedness, but now realized hecould always learn something new. ‘I have never heard such dreadful, horrible,blasphemous and abominable stuff as that which has been produced by the man whodescribes himself to you as the greatest living poet.’ When he asked the jury ifthey wanted the case to go on, they lost no time in returning a verdict againstCrowley.John Symonds makes the interesting observation that in spite of his defeat,Crowley felt elated. ‘The newspaper sellers had shouted out his name in thestreets of London and elsewhere. The world had stopped and stared and wondered.’Nothing could reveal more plainly that strange lack of realism that preventedCrowley from getting to grips with the world of actuality. The truth is that allCrowley's hopes, all his ambitions, had collapsed when Betty May and Mary Buttsdenounced him in the Sunday Express. He had always wanted to be recognized as agreat poet, as a prophet, as a messiah; after the Sunday Express revelations, hehad no more chance of achieving these ambitions than of becoming Archbishop ofCanterbury. Yet his understanding of his own situation was so poor that he feltthat being called horrible, blasphemous and abominable was a step in thedirection of the recognition he craved. Perhaps it was just as well. Some menare improved by facing total failure and learning to draw on their innerresources; but Crowley had never been of this type. Self-discipline could onlycarry him so far; then he had to turn for support to drugs, women and disciples.An accurate assessment of his situation in 1934 would probably have destroyedhim.As it was, the gods sent him immediate solace. As he left the court, anineteen-year-old girl rushed up to him, and told him she thought the verdictwas ‘the wickedest thing since the crucifixion.’ She went on to explain that shewould like to become the mother of his child. This was just what Crowley needed.He rushed her off to his bed, and forgot the defeat in acts of sex magic. Yethis diary for that day reveals a total inability to grasp what had happened: hewrote ‘Case violated by Swift [the judge] and Nina. General joy—theconsternation of Constable and Co.’—which seems to indicate a state ofself-delusion not far from insanity.Later that year, he again appeared in court, this time to answer the charge ofbeing in possession of Betty May's stolen letters. The man who was responsiblefor persuading Betty May to bring the case was a friend of Raoul Loveday'scalled Charles May who, according to Symonds, had also been responsible forhaving Crowley expelled from Cefalu. He told Symonds: ‘I am not at all ashamedof my share in this “Persecution.”’ Crowley was bound over and ordered to payfifty guineas costs.Crowley was to live on for another thirteen years, and yet there is a sense inwhich the Nina Hamnett law case marked the end of his career as a magician.There are no more major events in Crowley's life to record, and no more majorworks to discuss—although many regard his work on the tarot—The Book of Thoth(1944)—as a classic in its field.Crowley was bankrupted by the Hamnett case (although this was less serious thanit sounds, since he had no assets anyway). Friends like Germer continued to sendhim remittances, but certainly not enough to live in the style to which he wasaccustomed. The actor Oliver Wilkinson, son of Crowley's old friend Louis(Marlow) Wilkinson, mentions that there was a period in the 1930s when Crowleywas forced to live in slum lodgings in Paddington Green, and that LouisWilkinson asked his son not to give Crowley his address if he happened to runinto him—when Crowley was broke, he was in the habit of sending frantictelegrams to his friends, some of whom ran themselves deeply into debt torespond to his appeals. But Oliver Wilkinson adds that Crowley soon had money toturn his back on Paddington and return to Piccadilly and Jermyn Street. This mayhave been due to the sale of Crowley's Elixir of Life pills, which costtwenty-five guineas for enough to last a week, and which were supposed torestore sexual potency and generally increase vitality; his satisfied customerswere unaware that the chief ingredient in these pills was Crowley's own sperm.Or it may have been as a result of remittances from a new OTO Lodge in Pasadena,California, the Agape Lodge, which was part of the Church of Thelema. Founded bya Crowley disciple named Wilfred Smith, whom Crowley had met through his‘magical son’ Jones in 1915, it was soon taken over by a rocket engineer calledJack Parsons, who later became closely associated with another aspiring youngmagician named L. Ron Hubbard, later the founder of Scientology, who soon stoleParson's wife. Hubbard was later to claim that he was actually trying to breakup this ‘evil black magic group’, and that he actually succeeded; but theletters Parsons wrote to Crowley in the 1940s—which are quoted in The GreatBeast—leave no doubt that Parsons regarded Hubbard as a genuine magicalneophyte. Parsons later blew himself up in an experiment with rocket fuel.Oliver Wilkinson mentions that when he knew Crowley in the 1940s, Crowley's rentwas paid by the Pasadena sect.Oliver Wilkinson also leaves no doubt that Crowley's influence could be highlydestructive. His father and mother met Crowley in New York towards the end ofthe First World War; his mother, Frances, was an American poetess. (LouisWilkinson, who was, at that time, a well known man of letters, is now rememberedmainly as a friend of the Powys brothers.) Frances took an instant dislike toCrowley from the first time they went to have dinner with him in his skyscraperapartment in New York. Wilkinson, who was normally a self-controlled man,behaved extravagantly and foolishly at dinner, and Frances seems to havesuspected that Crowley was exercising some kind of sinister hypnotic influenceover him. Later, Crowley turned Wilkinson so thoroughly against her that hepersuaded him to have her certified insane; Frances got wind of the plot andsucceeded in escaping. But when she returned home later, in a state of physicalweakness and psychological shock, she found Crowley at the top of the stair,holding her three year old son Oliver by the hand. Crowley murmured:I met a silly woman yesterday…She had not approved of my friendship with herhusband…She returned home to find her two lovely babes on the mat in front ofthe fire in extraordinary positions [she said] without their heads. This womancould imagine her babies’ heads rolling on the carpet—rolling!…cut off in theirinfancy. Poor mad woman—she imagined I had done it.This was clearly an attempt by Crowley to drive Frances Wilkinson mad by a formof hypnotic suggestion. It did not work; Frances managed to persuade one of thedoctors—who was supposed to certify her—to tell her about Crowley's libellousallegations. Crowley was sufficiently alarmed—perhaps at the thought of anothercourt case—to drop his threats. He apparently ceased to visit the Wilkinsonsbecause he knew that Frances was aware he wore a wig (for some reason, he flatlydenied this) and was awaiting a chance to tear it off. (Many commentators haveremarked on Crowley's immense vanity.) But he warned her that he would followher wherever she went. Later, after she and Louis Wilkinson had divorced, shefound ‘tramp's signs’ outside the gate of her cottage in Essex, and recognisedthem as Crowley's magical symbols. Oliver Wilkinson comments: ‘None of us everfelt before or since such intensity of terror as then descended on us.’ It is aninteresting example of that odd malevolence, the tendency to nurse grudges, thatprevented Crowley achieving the kind of greatness he used to dream about. Heremained essentially a petty human being.Like so many of Crowley's ‘Scarlet Women’, the nineteen-year-old girl who hadapproached him after the Nina Hamnett trial ended up in a mental home. DorothyOlsen, the American woman who had stolen Crowley from Leah, drank herself todeath. Hanni Jaegar, the German girl with whom he had gone to Spain, committedsuicide soon after their separation. Symonds quotes Kenneth Grant to the effectthat Crowley chose these borderline women because of ‘their aptitude for gettingon the Astral Plane more easily than the average, better integrated person.’ Butit is difficult not to feel that Crowley went through life trailing some cloakof death and insanity behind him.Crowley remained in London throughout the war, at 93 Jermyn Street, until, in1944, he moved down to Aston Clinton, in Buckinghamshire, where he lodged at theBell Inn. It was the flying bombs that led to the move. He soon found it toolonely, and asked Louis Wilkinson to try and find him somewhere else. Wilkinsonasked his son Oliver, and when Oliver mentioned it in the dressing room of theHastings theatre where he was acting, one of the actors said he was opening an‘intellectual guest house.’ On 17 January 1945, Crowley moved into Netherwood,the Ridge, Hastings. Oliver Wilkinson, who had not seen Crowley since he wasthree, was surprised when he met him again. ‘I had expected a pretentiouswarlock, a dangerous clown, and I found an intelligent man…He was intelligent,with an intelligence that dried the air.’ Crowley sent Oliver a box of ‘the mostexpensive cigars in the world.’ Unaware until too late of how good they were,Oliver smoked them all, then confessed to Crowley that he had smoked themwithout appreciating them. Crowley thought he was asking for more, and sentanother lot—a typical example of the generosity that was part of Crowley'scharm.This last decade was not entirely unfruitful. In 1939 he delivered in London aseries of Eight Lectures on Yoga, which show Crowley at his best—witty,combative, almost Shavian in tone, although the tendency to make schoolboy jokesremains: ‘In highly civilized communitites like our own (loud laughter)…’ Butits eighty pages reveal that, in spite of the heroin and cocaine, Crowley'sintelligence was as dry and sharp as ever.In 1943, Crowley met a woman who asked his advice on ‘occult, spiritual andpractical matters’, and Crowley wrote her a series of letters beginning ‘CaraSoror’. He was back in his element again—the master giving advice to thedisciple. In fact, he so enjoyed writing her letters that he asked otherdisciples to ask him questions. He intended to publish the result under thetitle Aleister Explains Everything, but never got around to it. The letters(eighty of them) were finally published by Karl Germer, in 1954, as MagickWithout Tears, and they are probably the best introduction to Crowley's ideas inexistence. The tone is casual and light hearted, but he throws in some of hiskeenest insights: for example, after a letter devoted mainly to debunkingastrology, he admits that, for some odd reason, it seems to work, and adds: ‘Isee no objection at all to postulating that certain “rays” or other means oftransmitting some peculiar form or forms of energy, may reach us from otherparts of the solar system…’ What is so remarkable about Crowley the ‘magician’is that he remains Crowley the scientist, and always applies the same probingintellectual curiosity to every field he surveys. This is ultimately the mostimpressive quality about his mind, and the one that might—if he had concentratedon developing it to the full—have brought him the fame he craved. Crowley'stragedy was that he never concentrated for long enough to develop anything tothe full.The other major impression to emerge from Magick Without Tears is that—as odd asit sounds—one of Crowley's chief drawbacks was his sense of humour. This is adisability he shares with Bernard Shaw: both were driven by a strange compulsionto be flippant. But when he becomes absorbed in ideas, Shaw can remain seriousfor a sufficiently long time to convince the reader of his intellectual stature.In Crowley, the flippancy has the tone of a schoolmaster trying to be funny forthe benefit of the sixth form, or a muscular Christian trying to convince youthat he isn't really religious. ‘How can a yogi ever be worried?…That question Ihave been expecting for a very long time!’ (Crowley has never learned thatexclamation marks give the impression of a gushing schoolgirl.) ‘And what youexpect is to see my middle stump break the wicket-keeper's nose, with the ballssmartly fielded by Third Man and Short Leg!’ It makes us aware that there wassomething wrong with Crowley's ‘self image.’ He is one of those people who, nomatter how hard they try, never feel quite grown up.The best description of Crowley in this late period can be found in The Magickof Aleister Crowley by John Symonds.1 [part0012.html#fnr1] In the early 1940s,Symonds moved into a flat at 84 Boundary Road, Hampstead, where Victor Neuburghad died in 1940. He became curious about the man who had ‘cursed’ Neuburg, andsent Crowley a telegram asking him if he would write an article on magic for aliterary magazine. Crowley asked him down to Hastings for lunch. Symonds wasaccompanied by the astrologer Rupert Gleadow. ‘Netherwood’ was in a countrylane, and stood in private grounds. As they stood waiting, a slow, feeble stepsounded on the stairs, and an old man in plus fours, with a goatee beard and abald head, intoned querulously: ‘Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of thelaw.’ When Gleadow was introduced as an astrologer, Crowley remarked that hethought there was less than one per cent truth in astrology. Crowley had an oddstare; his eyes were ‘unusually wide as if he were prepared to hypnotise us.’ ‘Ibegan to feel that there was something a little strange about Crowley. It wasdifficult to say what, exactly, it was. Apart form the ring and the brooch, andhis peculiar sweetish smell (due to the holy oil of Abra-Melin the Mage) hemight be considered, I thought, an ordinary old man; and yet there was a qualityof remoteness about him…I can best describe this quality by saying that itsuggested that he cared very little for the usual occupations and considerationsof mankind. He had, however, one common failing: he was ambitious, and did notwant to depart hence without leaving as great a mark upon the earth aspossible.’After lunch they drank brandy and Crowley talked about prophecies of the end ofthe world, a matter in which he was evidently well versed. He mentionedNostradamus's prediction that Doomsday would occur in 1999, but was evidentlyunimpressed by it. So this thin, dessicated old man, whose daily doses of heroinwould kill a normal man, was the formidable Great Beast, now old, bored andrather pathetic. His subsequent correspondence with Symonds occasionally has aquerulous tone, as if he felt he was being neglected, and he sometimes signedhis letters ‘Aleister.’ (In earlier days, acquaintances had always addressed himas Crowley, or A.C, or Beast.) Symonds often had to hold him steady as heinjected himself in the armpit. And Symonds was responsible for the publicationof Crowley's final volume of verse, Olla—which, as usual, was almost totallyignored by reviewers.The juvenile sense of humour remained in evidence. He told Symonds of a visitfrom a military man, who had pulled such a face when Crowley prepared to injecthimself that Crowley went into the bathroom. There he placed his mouth near thekeyhole and proceeded to squeal like a stuck pig. When he came out, the militaryman looked sick and shaken.Symonds saw the news of his death on the front pages of the newspapers, togetherwith photographs of the ‘wickedest man in the world.’ Crowley would have beenflattered. He had died of myocardial degeneration and chronic bronchitis on thenight of 1 December, 1947. On Friday 5 December, Crowley was cremated atBrighton. Various ex-disciples and ex-mistresses were present, as well asSymonds and Gerald Yorke. Louis Wilkinson then read aloud Crowley's Hymn to Pan,beginning:Thrill with lissome lust of the light,O man! My Man!Come careering out of the nightOf Pan! Io Pan!Crowley had also requested that the whole Book of the Law should be read aloudbut—perhaps because this would have taken at least an hour—Wilkinson read onlyshort extracts. The Brighton Council was shocked to hear what had gone on intheir chapel, and a spokesman announced they would take steps to make sure itnever occurred again. Since there was only one Aleister Crowley, this was afairly safe promise to make.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0012.html#fn1]. Much of this was incorporated into the revised edition ofThe Great Beast, but the earlier book deserves to be read for its own sake."},{"pageContent":"EpilogueWHEN John Symonds first took his wife Margaret to meet Crowley, she received apowerful impression of evil. ‘Yes, evil haunted that face, but the years haddiluted its strength.’ And after Crowley had talked to her at some length abouthis trek across China, she felt that the room had become small and oppressive,‘and he flooded me again with a sense of evil, so that I visibly shivered.’ Butwas Crowley really ‘evil’ or was this largely her imagination? If evil isdefined as a pleasure in cruelty or destruction, then Crowley most certainlyfails to qualify. He was self-centred, and he did a great number of ‘caddish’things; but his worst behaviour was usually like that of a spoilt child.The argument that Crowley was evil depends upon some of his nastier writings.Oliver Wilkinson mentions that among Crowley's papers, there is a description oftying a negro to a tree, cutting a hole in his stomach, then inserting hispenis. If Crowley had ever done such a thing, it would certainly qualify him asgenuinely evil. But it is fairly certain that he was not, in the pathologicalsense, a sadist. The early Snowdrops from a Curate's Garden is an attempt torival Sade. But the very fact that Crowley never returned to sadistic fantasyindicates that it was merely another experiment in shocking the bourgeoisie. Itis worth bearing in mind that even Sade himself, who spent his whole life toyingwith such fantasies, never actually practised them; on one occasion when he hada chance to revenge himself on the mother-in-law who had caused him to beimprisoned for years, he showed Chrisitan forbearance.The chief impression left by a study of Crowley's life and works is that hewasted an immense amount of time and energy trying to shock everyone he cameinto contact with, and that his dislike of orthodoxy turned him into anunconsciously comic figure, like Don Quixote. Everyone has experienced a feelingof blind rage against authority—if only when a traffic warden hands them aticket. And we have all known people in whom some early clash with authority hascreated a lifelong neurosis, a conditioned reflex of hatred against some groupof people—homosexuals, Jews, blacks, policemen…Such people strike us as stupidas well as rather dangerous, because they have become victims of a purelymechanical reaction. Crowley's early contact with religious bigots made him thelifelong victim of such a reaction; the lightest touch on his anti-authoritybutton made him swing into action like a mechanical toy.The chief problem of this reflex is that it is self-perpetuating. It arousesviolent hostility, and the hostility reinforces the original resentment. Caughtin this vicious circle, many ‘rebels’ turn into criminals, and a percentage ofsuch criminals into mass murderers. (The annals of modern crime contain dozensof such cases—Manson, the Moors murderers, the Yorkshire Ripper…) The outragedego, shaking its fist at authority, becomes trapped in its own resentment untilit becomes—in theory at least—capable of destroying all mankind. Sensible peopledraw back long before they reach this point, and Crowley was restrained by aninstinct of self-preservation. But it was this ‘criminal’ element in him thatwas sensed by people who felt he was evil.It is interesting to note Crowley's habit of relieving his bowels on people'scarpets. In the twentieth century, this has become an increasingly frequentfeature of burglaries, and criminologists recognize it as a gesture ofrebellion. The burglar is not merely in someone's apartment for the practicalpurpose of taking money, but to commit a kind of symbolic rape, to express theresentment of the have-not for the haves. Crowley was expressing a differentkind of resentment, but it undoubtedly has the same ‘criminal’ origin. It hasbecome generally recognized—so much so that it has become a boringcommonplace—that this type of pathology is usually associated with a lack oflove in childhood. Animal ethologists have observed that creatures who havereceived no love in the early, formative period of their lives becomepermanently incapable of feeling affection. Crowley's parents, with their narrowreligious obsession, seem to have been the type who were incapable of expressingspontaneous affection. In turn, he became incapable of showing affection forwives or children. Although he occasionally declares in the magical journalsthat he has ‘fallen in love’, none of his relationships with women involved whatwould normally be described as love. Women aroused in him a crude desire toassert his masculinity by penetrating them, which brought a triumphant sense ofviolation. He wanted them to behave like nymphomaniacs. He wrote of onemistress: ‘we went crazy…we tore off our clothes and fucked and fucked andfucked. And suddenly she got a jealous fit about three cheap whores…and Istrangled her…Woke up early and finished the fuck.’ His relations with womenwere devoid of the normal element of solicitude or protectiveness.Sex is certainly the main key to Crowley's mentality; but so is the fact that hewas a late Victorian. (The early Victorians were far less prudish than theirchildren; nude mixed bathing was common until the 1860s at seaside resorts.) TheVictorians became so embarrassed about sex that they covered up table legs, andinvented a special kind of straitjacket for babies to prevent them from touchingtheir genitals in bed. So for Crowley, sex was always something deliciously‘dirty’ and wicked. In many ways, his development parallels that of Freud. When,in the 1880s, Freud first began to suspect that sexual frustration might be thekey to mental illness, the idea so frightened and shocked him that he hardlydared to put it into words; he felt that it would mean professional disgrace andruin. And the very fact that the idea created such inner turmoil convinced himthat it must be true. If he had lived in a less prudish society, he might simplyhave concluded that sexual problems can lead to neuroses, and left it at that.But the fact that the idea struck him as too awful to utter led him to go muchfurther, and to assert that all neurosis, without exception, has a sexualorigin, and to exaggerate the sexual element out of all proportion. Crowleyreacted in exactly the same manner. The idea of prostitution, of seduction, ofadultery, aroused in him a kind of feverish, panting excitement, and he wasquick to suspect anyone with a touch of puritanism of the same violent response.‘I cannot omit to mention one atrocity at Agra. Some prurient English curatorhad indulged his foul instincts by whitewashing a magnificent fresco in thepalace because it was “improper”. In other words, he was so leprously lasciviousthat anything which reminded him of reproduction produced a frenzied spasm ofsensuality in his soul…’ In fact, the unfortunate curator was probably thinkingof the officers’ wives and daughters who would be shown around the palace, andtrying to spare their blushes. So Crowley's overreaction to authority wascompounded with an equally unrealistic overreaction to sex, which led him tobelieve he was being iconoclastic when he was only sticking out his tongue atlong-dead Victorians. His sexual rebellion, like his social rebellion, tends tostrike us as much ado about nothing.It might seem that, for a man handicapped by these paranoid obsessions, chancesof real personal development were minimal. But there was a third component inCrowley's peculiar make-up: a kind of romantic mysticism, a feeling that Yeatsexpressed in the lines:…what the world's million lips are searching forMust be substantial somewhereand a consequent longing for the ‘horns of elfland’.This is why Eckartshausen's Cloud Upon the Sanctuary exercised upon Crowley aspowerful an influence as Sinnett's Esoteric Buddhism (with its talk of ‘SecretMasters’) had upon Yeats. Unfortunately, the mystical order described inEckarthausen was non-existent. But a chance meeting with George Cecil Jones ledCrowley into what seemed to be the next best thing, the Golden Dawn, andestablished his course for the rest of his life.This is admittedly the point at which the modern reader tends to lose touch withCrowley and his motivations. The idea of dressing up in ceremonial robes andmarching around in circles chanting ‘Adonai ha-Aretz, Malkuth, Geburah, Gedulah’sounds rather absurd. Magic seems to be pure self-delusion. But, as I havesuggested in the opening chapter, such a view may be superficial. For somestrange reason, magic can work. And this, as Crowley recognized, is because itis based on a recognition of unknown powers of the human mind. For most of us,the word ‘magician’ conjures up a picture of a Walt Disney character in aconical hat waving a magic wand. Yet the things that take place at ‘spiritualistseances’ every day are a kind of magic, and would have been recognized as suchby our ancestors. So is the kind of telepathy that takes place between mostmarried couples. So is one of the most commonplace forms of paranormal phenomenaknown as the ‘projection of the double’. In 1881, a student named S. H. Beardtold his girlfriend, Miss Verity, that he was going to try to ‘appear’ to herlater that evening, and in due course, Miss Verity and her sister were terrifiedto see Beard standing in their bedroom, then vanishing into thin air. Beard saidhe did it by a peculiar ‘effort of volition’ which he could not describe. TheSociety for Psychical Research recorded hundreds of such cases in its earlydays. This is one of the simplest and most straightforward forms of ‘magic.’1[part0013.html#fnr1]This is obviously the major question raised by the study of Crowley's life andworks. Did he possess magical powers? If so, what were their nature? In theearly days, when Crowley was performing magic in his ‘temple’ in London or atBoleskine House, it seems fairly clear that what he was doing was closelyrelated to what happens in the seance room, (although Crowley always professed agreat contempt for seances). And the same is probably true of the strange eventsdescribed in ‘The Visions and the Voice.’ But this was not the kind of magic inwhich Crowley was really interested. Crowley wanted to be a magician because hewanted power—power over other people. (One of his female admirers, MarthaKuntzel, was quite right to see a close resemblance between Crowley and Hitler.)And it seems clear that, in this department, he succeeded. Seabrook'sstory—related in the first chapter—of how Crowley walked down Fifth Avenuebehind a businessman, and caused him to stumble and fall, is a typical example.So is a story related by Oliver Wilkinson, of a house party that took placeafter the Second World War, when Crowley was ‘old and harmless.’ Crowley wassitting on his haunches by the fire as two other men talked. One man suddenlyfell sideways, his head close to the floor, and stayed there. The other droppedon all fours and began to behave like a dog, barking, whining, scratching thedoor. Then the other man got up and rushed out of the French windows; hereturned the next day, his clothes torn and his face bleeding. Oliver's motherFrances had seen Crowley do something similar in New York—caused a man to actlike a dog; when the man recovered, he tried to pass it off as a joke. FrancesWilkinson obviously suspected Crowley of exercising a similar influence on herhusband that first evening when they went to dine with Crowley, and LouisWilkinson began to talk ‘extravagantly, in a manner quite unlike his usualself.’Oliver Wilkinson suggests that Crowley may have achieved these effects by drugsor hypnosis. Neither seems likely, unless we are willing to recognize that thereis another form of hypnosis that operates directly from will to will. I havecited elsewhere2 [part0013.html#fnr2] a number of cases in which hypnotists wereapparently able to achieve power over someone by a form of telepathic hypnosis.In the celebrated Heidelberg case, a criminal was able to achieve total powerover a woman—even to the point of persuading her to murder her husband—by merelytouching her hand. Crowley seems to have had a similar power over certain women.John Symonds tells a story of a titled lady who was looking into the window ofFortnum and Mason when she felt an ominous presence beside her. In the window,she saw Crowley's reflection staring at her. Crowley introduced himself; theyvanished into the Ritz [where she was staying] and emerged ten days later. Soonafter, her marriage collapsed.3 [part0013.html#fnr3] Crowley obviously sensedthis same susceptibility to his power when he first met Leah Hirsig, andimmediately began to kiss her. Leah was not, in fact, Crowley's usual type—heliked well-built, large-breasted women, and Leah was thin and flat chested. ButCrowley sensed that she could be entirely dominated by his will. In A Voyage toArcturus, David Lindsay mentions that this kind of domination ‘satisfies thehunger of the will exactly as food satisfies the hunger of the body.’ Crowleyknew all about the hunger of the will.Another twentieth century ‘magician’, Gurdjieff, also seemed to know about thesestrange powers of the will, although he never used them as Crowley did, purelyfor his own satisfaction. Gurdjieff's chief disciple Ouspensky has described howGurdjieff was able to communicate with him telepathically by causing a voice tospeak inside his chest—even when they were in different rooms. Another follower,Fritz Peters, has described how Gurdjieff was able to cause a girl to faint bymerely telling the pianist to play a certain musical chord when she was in theroom.4 [part0013.html#fnr4] Gurdjieff also obviously knew some of the basictricks of ‘magic.’ According to Rom Landau, he was also able to exercise adirect sexual influence upon women—one woman felt she had been suddenly ‘struckthrough the sexual centre’, and turned to find Gurdjieff's hypnotic gaze fixedupon her. Gurdjieff and Crowley seem to have met only once, when Crowley went totea at Gurdjieff's priory at Fontainebleau; Gurdjieff apparently kept a watchfuleye on Crowley, and C. S. Nott said of this meeting: ‘I got a strong impressionof two magicians, the white and the black—the one strong, powerful, full oflight: the other also powerful, but heavy, dull, ignorant.’5[part0013.html#fnr5]This, then, was the kind of magic Crowley knew how to exercise. He also seems tohave possessed, to a high degree, the power that Jung called ‘activeimagination’—the power to descend into the unconscious and see ‘visions.’ Thisis—as we have already noted—the power that the Kabbalist quite deliberately setsout to cultivate, and accounts of it can be found in most books on magic.6[part0013.html#fnr6] We have seen that Crowley understood one of the basicsecrets of the human mind: how to side-step the everyday personality and descendinto the deeper levels of the mind; he showed Jane Wolfe how to call upon thispower when he forced her to make a ‘magical retirement’ in a tent near the abbeyof Thelema. And Crowley himself learned to call upon these powers of theunconscious mind—or the right brain—in his own magical retirements: for example,in the sixth of his Eight Lectures on Yoga, he describes a vision he experiencedduring a magical retirement near Lake Pasquaney in New Hampshire, when he saw arepresentation of the universe in which he saw that the stars were actuallyideas and souls, and that the rays connecting them were—paradoxically—alsostars.All this offers us one of the clearest clues to the nature of magic. Humanbeings find it very hard to realize that the experience of boredom and futilityis an experience of feeling trapped in the external world, and that theexperience of freedom consists of a descent into oneself. It may seem selfevident, for example, that when a man is involved in lovemaking, hisconsciousness is focused upon the other person. In fact, a little introspectionreveals that this is not so. The more deeply he is involved in lovemaking, themore deeply his centre of consciousness is ‘inside’ himself—just as, forexample, when he is listening to music. It is as if he takes the girl (or themusic) inside himself. The more we feel trapped in the external universe, themore we feel helpless and ‘contingent.’ The more we can descend ‘inside’ourselves, the more we feel a curious certainty that no unexpected catastropheswill occur—and this seems to be borne out by experience.Jung noted that it is in these ‘inward’ states in which we experience strange‘synchronicities’—oddly significant coincidences. When, for example, I amworking well, and am absorbed in what I am doing, I often seem to ‘stumble’ uponexactly the piece of information that I shall need for the next page or so, andI have described elsewhere7 [part0013.html#fnr7] how, when I was writing anarticle about synchronicity, absurd synchronicities began to occur in startlingprofusion, as if to reinforce my conviction that I was on the right track.‘Magic’ seems to be, to some extent, inducing these states of mind in whichsynchronicities will occur. And since we can induce these states of mind—albeitrather haphazardly—this means that there is an element of natural magic abouteveryday living. We are all apprentice magicians.So we can see that Crowley—in spite of that lifelong element of delinquency—waspursuing the basic ‘romantic quest’ in his own special way. This is why hecould, even in his worst moments, feel a certain self-justification. In spite ofhis faults, he was engaged in his own rather bumbling, incompetent quest for theabsolute. When he wrote poetry, when he climbed mountains, when he practised hismagical incantations, he experienced the sudden glow of meaning, of immenseaffirmation. This is why he never ceased to insist that he was a mystic. This iswhy, even when he had just indulged in some appallingly selfish piece ofbehaviour, he could assure himself that he had never betrayed his ideals.Crowley's problem is summarized in the comment of Mencius—already quoted: ‘Thosewho follow the part of themselves that is great will become great men; those whofollow the part of themselves that is small will become small men.’ We allconsist of many possible selves, and our experience and our behaviour nourishesdifferent aspects of ourselves. Every one of us contains a bit of Saint Francisof Assisi and a bit of Jack the Ripper, as well as assorted fragments ofCasanova, John Knox, Einstein, Scrooge, Plato, W. C. Fields and a hundredothers. The personality that finally becomes dominant depends partly uponchance, but much more upon individual choice. Acts of free will determine theultimate balance. Crowley, for all his geniune idealism, leaned heavily towardsself-indulgence. So when it became a choice between his own convenience and thatof somebody else, he invariably chose himself. Every time the Shelley inside himstarted to gain the ascendancy, it was outmanoevred by the Flashman.One of the most puzzling things about Crowley is that he was so lacking incritical insight into himself. He could always manage to find somejustification, even for his worst pieces of behaviour. Oddly enough, hepossessed a highly developed sense of ‘karma’ or destiny, the feeling that lifeis full of hidden meanings, and that our conduct determines our fate. Yet as heleft a trail of destruction and betrayals behind him, it never seemed to strikehim that this same ‘law’ would sooner or later involve him in retribution.Reading about Crowley produces the same sensation as reading about Al Capone orLucky Luciano or Bonnie and Clyde: that his downfall was somehow inevitable.There is a feeling that a man who deserts his wife and child and sacrifices acat and forces his mistress to submit to intercourse with a goat is somehowcreating his own bad luck.How, then, do we explain the currrent Crowley revival, which has led to all hismajor works (and many of the minor ones) being reprinted? This is partly becauseCrowley symbolizes a kind of mindless rebellion against authority. He hasbecome—as Symonds points out—the ‘unsung hero of the hippies’; his ‘Do what thouwilt’ appeals to the feelings that produced the pot-smoking, flower-powerrebellion of the 60s, as well as to the hatred of authority that led Hell'sAngels to smear themselves in excrement. If Crowley had been alive in the era ofCharles Manson and later of the Sex Pistols, he would have found a host ofenthusiastic followers.But there is also a more discriminating response to Crowley's message. After theSecond World War, there was a strong revival of interest in ‘occultism.’ The lawthat made witchcraft illegal in England was repealed in 1951, and three yearslater, a ‘witch’ called Gerald Gardner published Witchcraft Today, alleging thatthere are still dozens of covens—groups of witches—practising all over England.He explained that they were followers of a nature-religion called wicca. Gardnerwas a friend of Crowley's, and an initiate of the OTO, and Crowley authorisedhim to set up his own magical group. Gardner liked being flagellated, and hisversion of wicca laid heavy emphasis on sex rites in which everyone was nude.Understandably, it quickly gained hordes of disciples. Crowley's version of‘magick’ was, naturally, much in evidence in these covens. Many members of suchgroups lost interest as they got older; others developed a wider interest inmagic, and studied seriously the Enochian system of John Dee, the magic of theGolden Dawn, and Crowley's own sex-orientated system. For readers wishing tolearn more of the modern magical revival, there are excellent books by writerslike Francis King, Stephen Skinner and Robert Turner. These make it clear thatthere is a strong connection between magic and Jung's concepts of activeimagination and synchronicity.After Crowley's death, Karl Germer became the active head of the OTO, althoughthere continued to be splinter groups, particularly in Germany. (This hasgreatly confused the question of Crowley copyright, for Crowley left copyrightin his works to the OTO, and several groups can therefore claim to own them.) Itwas Germer who gave a charter to an occultist named Kenneth Grant to set up hisown OTO group in England. Germer later regretted his decision, and told Grant hewas expelled, but Grant has continued to regard himself as head of the Britishorganization of the OTO. In this capacity, he has written a number of remarkableand fascinating books on magic, with titles like The Magical Revival andAleister Crowley and the Hidden God, the first of which is probably the besthistory of modern magic in existence. Grant is less interested in Crowley'sdefects as a human being than in his insights as a magician, and he takes TheBook of the Law as seriously as Crowley took it himself. Being, in general, afar clearer writer than Crowley, and lacking Crowley's tendency to drag in hisown personality, he is a far better exponent of Crowleyan ‘magick’ than Crowleyhimself.Yet in spite of Grant's skilful advocacy, it is difficult to take Crowleyseriously, even as a student of magic. The hatred of religion and the convictionthat he himself was the new messiah taints all his serious work with a kind ofsilliness, just as The Book of the Law is tainted by his Swinburnian tendency tochildish blasphemy. The anti-authoritarianism which originated in his dislike ofthe Plymouth Brethren led to an emphasis on the pleasures of the senses thatstrikes us as absurdly exaggerated; all the talk about lissom lusts and scarletsins seems as old fashioned as the Yellow Book and Wilde's ‘love that dare notspeak its name.’ Again and again, his ideas are marred by a kind of crudity thatmakes them seem too obvious, so the reader has an impulse to murmur ‘Elementary,my dear Crowley.’This can be seen clearly in his psychological system, as expounded to FrankBennett at the Abbey of Thelema. The subconscious mind (Freud would have saidthe unconscious) is our true self, and we should not try to repress its desires.This is where the Plymouth Brethren went wrong—trying to weaken their sexualdesires until they had become seething masses of repression. Freedom consists inceasing to repress the subconscious mind, and instead, learning to do its will…This may be good Freudianism, but it is bad ‘occultism.’ Traditional occultismhas always been based upon the view that man possesses a ‘higher will’, and thathis problem is to learn to act in accordance with it. Aldous Huxley oncesummarized this view as the notion that the human mind possesses an unconsciousbasement, full of black beetles and vermin, but that it also possesses asuperconscious attic, which is as much ‘above’ ordinary consciousness as thebasement is below it. Huxley suggests that it is this ‘attic’ which isresponsible for paranormal powers like telepathy, second sight and precognition.Crowley's psychological theories were so limited by his anti-authoritarianismand his sexual obsession that such a notion would have been completely beyondhim. He often stated that ‘Do what thou wilt’ did not mean ‘Do whatever youlike’ but ‘Do your true will.’ But this simple Freudian plan of themind—bungalow-with-basement—meant that, like Freud, he felt that the basicanswer lay in freedom from repression—in ‘letting it all hang out.’ And this is,in fact, what he practised, and encouraged his followers to practise—withresults that could be seen in the cigarette-addicted five year old at the Abbey,and in Crowley's own slavery to heroin. Crowley, like Freud, ‘sold human natureshort’, and his ideas—as expressed, for example, in The Confessions—seem oddlycrude and simplistic, as if there was a whole dimension of meaning that hecompletely overlooked. The same applies to his poetry, where the use ofovercoloured adjectives cannot disguise the lack of genuinely poetic dimension,a sense of ‘unknown modes of being’. And since Crowley himself failed to seethis, the final impression he leaves behind is that his ultimate defect was lackof judgement.Yet when all this has been said, it has to be admitted that there is still anelement in Crowley that commands respect. In moods of depression, he himselfoften recognized the defects of his character. Yet he insisted that these wereunimportant compared to the doctrines for which he was the chosen vessel. Thisis why he wanted the complete Book of the Law read aloud at his funeral service.He believed he had been the recipient of an important message, and that it washis task to convey it to the rest of the human race. He was being perfectlyserious when he compared himself to Mohammed, and he believed that the Book ofthe Law would one day be recognized as the new Koran. ‘I, the Beast, the ManAleister Crowley, whose number is 666, help to show forth this truth to men.’And what precisely is this truth? It can be summarized in four propositions: (1)Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law, (2) Love is the law, love underwill, (3) Every man and woman is a star, and (4) Magick is the Science and Artof causing Change to occur in conformity with the Will. The first twopropositions are not, in fact, to be found in The Book of the Law; they areCrowley's own formulation of its central message. The fourth proposition (fromMagick in Theory and Practice) is Crowley's central definition of magic. TheBook of the Law states: ‘The word of the law is thelema.’ On this, Crowleycommented: ‘Compare Rabelais. Also it may be translated, “Let Will and Action bein harmony.” He then adds: ‘But thelema also means Will in the higher sense ofMagical One-pointedness, and in the sense used by Schopenhauer and Fichte.’ Butwe can cut through all the confusions about its meaning if we simply recognizethat Crowley had spent his childhood listening to statements about ‘the will ofGod.’ His parents were the kind of people who would preface any statement ofintention with ‘God willing’ or ‘If it be the will of God.’ The state of mindinduced by such a continual affirmation is that the universe is, for allpractical purposes, predetermined, and that man possesses no free will.It is interesting to note that when Crowley began to study magic and mysticism,he still found himself haunted by the Christian God; the name can be found onevery page of The Cloud Upon the Sanctuary, as well as in the Book of Abra-Melinthe Mage and in the rituals of the Golden Dawn. Crowley must have felt he hadescaped one insidious form of Christianity only to fall victim to another. Atestimony to his exasperation can be found on the title page of one of hisearliest works, The High History of Good Sir Palomedes, where the date is givenas ‘Anno Pseudo Christi MCMXII’. Crowley could not feel free until he hadcreated his own religion without the Christian God or its ‘pseudo saviour.’Once we can grasp that acceptance of human free will is the core of Crowley'sreligion, then it can be seen that ‘Do what thou wilt’ is more than arestatement of Rabelais's motto; it represents a major philosophicalaffirmation. That he thought of it in this way is clear from his mention ofSchopenhauer and Fichte. In Schopenhauer, the Will is the truth behind the worldof illusions and appearances. And the most important recognition of thephilosopher Fichte is that as soon as man launches himself into action, hebecomes conscious of his freedom—a freedom that eludes him while he contentshimself with mere thinking. One of Rudolf Steiner's earliest and most importantbooks was called The Philosophy of Freedom, and was an attack on scientificmaterialism and an assertion of the reality of the human will. If Crowley hadstarted his career with a similar book, it would be a great deal easier tounderstand his significance as a thinker. The discovery that man possesses a‘controlling ego’, which presides over consciousness, is the foundation stone ofhis magical philosophy. This is why, while agreeing that ‘love is the law’, heinsists: ‘Love under will’. According to Christianity, love is the essence ofthe created universe; God is love, and the basic teaching of Christianity isthat men should love one another. Crowley agrees, but he cannot accept that loveis the be-all and end-all of the universe: so he adds the all-importantpostscript: ‘Love under will’. Free will is the foundation stone, not love.When man stops thinking of himself as a mere passive ‘creature’, and grasps thathe is free, he at last ceases to be a mediocrity; he grasps that he is, in fact,a ‘star’. In 1922, Crowley told Sullivan:Every man and woman is a star. You, being a man, are therefore a star. The soulof a star is what we call genius. You are a genius. This fact is obscured eitherby moral complexes which enmesh it, or lack of adequate machinery to express it…Sullivan took Crowley's words to heart, wrote his perplexities and frustrationsout of his system in an excellent autobiography, then went on to become thefirst rate writer that Crowley knew him to be. He is a good advertisement forCrowley's conviction that every man and woman is a star.But perhaps the most interesting of all the propositions that Crowley deducedfrom his recognition of free will was his belief that magic is the science andart of causing changes to occur in conformity with the will. Other modernthinkers have asserted that the essence of human existence is freedom—notablythe ‘existentialists’. But most of them feel that, although man is free, he istrapped in a world of matter which always has the last word. Man is free, buthis freedom is purely a mental attribute, the ‘eternal spirit of the chainlessmind.’ It cannot save him from suffering and dying miserably. Crowley's deepestinstincts revolted against this poor-spirited view. He was convinced that, oncea man has grasped his own freedom, he ceases to be the helpless victim ofcircumstance; he can somehow cause changes to occur in conformity with his will.Man's mind has exactly the same power as his hands: not merely to grasp theworld, but to change it.But if the man is free, what can he do with his freedom? How can he express it?Crowley's first solution to this problem was to travel round the world and sailup crocodile-infested rivers and climb mountains: in short, to become anadventurer. This failed because, as Chesterton rightly observes, an adventure isonly an inconvenience rightly considered, and inconvenience is not particularlyuplifting to the soul. Crowley's next venture was to award himself varioushonorary titles, publish books at his own expense, and try to become acelebrity. This was also a failure, largely due to lack of public interest.Finally as a last resort, Crowley returned to magic—and instantly achievedremarkable success. Crowley discovered, to his astonishment, that the Enochian‘calls’ really worked. And when Reuss initiated him into the secrets of sexualmagic, he felt he had finally solved the problem of expressing his ‘true will’.The Book of the Law says: ‘Take your fill and will of love as ye will, when,where and with whom ye will! But always unto me.’ That is, have as much sex asyou like, but dedicate each sexual act to the Holy Guardian Angel. Crowleycarried out these instructions to the letter, and apparently achieved magicalvisions, like the one at Lake Pasquaney. Convinced that he was at last on theright track, he devoted the rest of his life to the study of magic and The Bookof the Law. And disciples like Bennett, Loveday, Mudd, Regardie and Cammellbecame convinced that Crowley's claim to be the founder of the new religion wasfactually true. They grasped that the essence of this new religion was humanfree will, and recognized that, in this basic respect, it differed fundamentallyfrom Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, Islam and the rest.There was, however, another basic difference between these earlier religions andthe faith of thelema. They had been founded by avatars or prophets whoidentified themselves totally with their teachings. Crowley admitted freely thathe had done his best to evade his responsibility as the custodian of The Book ofthe Law. Disciples like Norman Mudd and Leah Hirsig recognized this when theydenounced Crowley for ceasing to be faithful to The Book of the Law, anddeclared themselves the new custodians. The religion of thelema claimed to bethe direct word of some superhuman entity, who announced the coming of the newage, and its basic teaching was the reality of free will. Crowley regardedhimself as an extremely imperfect mouthpiece of this teaching. But he alsobelieved that any final merit he possessed was the result of having been chosento propagate the religion of Ra-Hoor-Khuit.The priest of Ra-Hoor-Khuit was a failure as a human being, as he himself wasinclined to acknowledge in moments of honesty. But he thought that unimportantcompared to the religion of thelema, the philosophy of human free will thatwould enable man to evolve to a higher stage. If we ignore Crowley andconcentrate on the philosophy, it seems highly probable that he was right.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0013.html#fn1].
