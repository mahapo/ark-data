Though we are all guided, if we so choose, by the Supreme Creator, still it is one's Earthly helpers that must be counted first, even before oneself-for without their aid, where would one be? First and foremost of my Earthly helpers whom I wish to acknowledge is my wife and faithful companion of twenty-one years, Lloydine Bolon Ik, my constant helper and chief inspiration of all I do. The faith and trust she put in me at times when all we had was blind faith are a touching memorial to a soul who has always believed that love is the greatest truth. Assisting us greatly during the time since we arrived in Oregon and have contin- ued to dedicate our lives to the fulfillment of the prophecy of Pacal Votan and the Great Calendar Change is our devoted helper and assistant Stephanie South, the Red Queen, Red Electric Serpent, who conscientiously read and edited this text in its final form, helped in numerous details, and so kept me from ever bogging down. Of equal trust and value is that one from the immemorial rainbow to whom I owe so much, Kin 19, David Rinck, \"the stalwart,\" whose enhancements of my art- work are ingenious and awesome. All three of these people share one thing in com- mon: absolute belief in and dedication to the Law of Time as a living reality that gives breath to all we do. I must also thank the incomparable Spectral Skywalker, Mark Comings, whose mind has been of inestimable value to me through our many memorable background discussions on time in modern physics in relation to the Law of Time. In this regard,"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"I would also like to mention Irina Eganova of the Sobolev Institute of Mathematics of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Novosibirsk, for her rigorous approach to N. A. Kozyrev-may she smile well when she reads this book. For their unconditional support I would also like to honor and thank Brian and Deborah Haight of the Foundation for the Law of Time, and all the many friends and beloved kin of the Planet Art Network everywhere, but especially to the Russian kin who so ably understood the Law of Time and opened up gold mines of knowledge and friend- ship in the Russian Academy of Sciences in Novosibirsk, as well as the great pristine valleys of Altai, where the shamans await the next installment of The Mayan Factor. Spirituality is at the core of the biosphere-noosphere transition, and in this re- gard the beings I have to thank are without number, yet some especially stand out and deserve mention: my Tibetan teacher, the Sakyong Dorje Dradul Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche, through whose cremation he entrusted me with all; my son, Josh, who opened the doors of the fourth dimension for me so that I would never be satisfied with less; and Mother Tynetta Muhammad, who showed me the way of the Holy Quran with the guidance of the mystic master FM, and who introduced me to the great work of Dr. Rashad Khalifa, whose breaking of the Quranic nineteen code led to his martyrdom, leaving me to fulfill what he revealed. The creation of a book, the coming into manifestation of an artistic conception, is a complex process involving numerous other eyes and minds in order to bring the effort into its final published form. In this process two people have stood out deserv- ing of mention. First of all, there is Michael Moynihan, White Galactic WIzard, who very patiently and carefully copyedited the book-always with an eye on maintaining and enhancing the original artistic vision-and who stood by the integrity of its vision through the entire editorial process. His work was complemented by the efforts of project editor Lee Awbrey, Blue Lunar Eagle, who took on an increasingly engaging role and personality as we brought this book to its final stages. I am especially appreciative for her inspiration to rework the Preface and Chapter One, which I gladly did, and which I feel speak more immediately to the reader of this book. Thank you both, and may the success of this book redound to your consummate care for the truth. Finally I would like to honor and thank my children: Tara, the golden one, my grandson, SamuelJoshua Sheps, andJeff of Engine Company Number Nine in Phoe- nix; also Paul Mecklenburg, who has always held the faith in our work, and Heidi Mecklenburg, that her dream of the Unicorn Princess may become true once again. x . Acknowledgments"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Time and the Technosphere: The Law of Time in Human Affairs is essentially a pro- longed set of meditatipns occasioned by the one most powerful and overwhelming , ~ event of our time, the 9-11, the Inevitable Event of September 11,2001. Subsequent events may overshadow this one in horro r a nd magnitude, b ut it was this event i n particular, the destruction of the World Trade Center towers, that sent a signal that something very profound had occurred to change the way we think of ourselves and our future. In presenting these meditations and reflections in the form of a book, I am pain- fully aware of the limitations of this medium in the information age. Keeping in mind that the volume of information has increased five times in the past century- with much of that increase occurring only in the past decade-I am very reluctant to put anything down to be published in the form of a book. I was raised well on the writings of Marshall McLuhan and his definitions of media and how they affect our senses. It is altogether obvious that a book in your hand is not the same as reading a text on a computer screen. A book is actually something made to last. Of course, the computer has made it possible and easy for virtually anybody and everybody to write a book, and so we encounter one of the great hazards of the information age: the decline in discrimination and the criteria of excellence. Who can now tell what is worth read- ing or not? These reflections, too, are very much to the point of the grand theme of this text. If a book is meant to last, how long will this book last? It should last until the New Time has established a new order of reality on this now anguished Earth. Whether or not destruction and the total collapse of civilization will occur first, we do not really know. That is a matter left to the Divine Mind of God alone. Nonetheless, it is with faith that we continue on this Earth at this time. A pressing Preface. xi"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"voice told me to go ahead and to write this book, regardless-but then, this is how I have always done it. Those who are at all familiar with any of my earlier books, will find that Time and the Technosphere is but a continuation of themes that have pro- voked me since I first considered literature as a medium of communication. It is important to know where the author is coming from, and how he got to this particu- lar point of reflection. In this regard, Time and the Technosphere is the organic result of a lifelong pursuit of a study of the nature of art, time, and history. This study has been woven together by a dialectical process that defines the evolving nature of consciousness. So, for those who are interested, herewith follows a brief literary autobiography, the better to understand my point of view. My earliest book, Charles Henry and the Formation of a Psychophysical Aesthetic (1972), states the grand theme of a holistic science that unifies body and mind, sense and nature, the harmonic pursuit of which has been at the root of all my endeavors. This pursuit was amply demonstrated in my second book, Mandala (1972), which, as a root text of the counterculture, was an artistic, philosophical, and cosmic plea for a harmonic resolu- tion to the process of history. It is a sign of the times that Mandala is no longer in print, but instead a book bearing the same title, but which does not even include the original Mandala in its bibliography, is in print with the same publisher. Amnesia is one of the side-effects resulting from information overflow with no discrimination. Unfortunately, cultural amnesia is always accompanied by an increase in trivialization, and thus we arrive at the mediocrity and sensationalism of the present moment. My next book, The Transformative Vision: Reflections on the Nature and History of Human Expression (1975, 1991), took the aesthetic and unitive themes of the first two books to the next stage of my visionary analytical process, elaborating on the mean- ing of time, history, and cosmos. In rereading the later chapters of The Transforma- tive Vision, I am struck by their prophetic accuracy, as well as their sense of impend- ing tragedy. It is hard to believe that only 26 years have gone by since that book was first published and now we are plunged into the maelstrom of what was then thought to be the worst scenario possible. The Transformative Vision also defined human con- sciousness as the cerebral-neurological dialectic of psyche (aboriginal, primal intui- tive art) and techne (civilizational, rational science), emphasizing that only in their absolute synthesis would there be a harmonic resolution to the problem of history. Seen in this light, the technosphere represents the extreme, one-sided triumph of techne, while terrorism is the expression of the absolute repression of psyche. The crucial question then arises: how will we ever attain a balance or harmony? Investigation of the ongoing dialectic of consciousness was continued in my next effort, the philosophically synthesizing work entitled The Feminine, Spacious as the xii. Preface"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Sky (1977), which was written and artistically produced with my previous partner and wife, Miriam Tarcov, who also co-authored Mandala with me. The feminine aspect represents a deepening reflection of the psychic, intuitive side of human na- ture. Expressed through a whole range of images, symbols, and philosophies that describe both the aboriginal root and the final flowering of human consciousness, it is this feminine aspect that has been smothered by the historical process, resulting in the technosphere. Why and how did this occur? These questions drove me to the next stages of my visionary investigations. From the beginning of my pursuits I have been moved by my intuitive awareness of our intrinsic wholeness as humans, and the knowledge that this wholeness is a reflection of the wholeness of Earth, the solar system, and the cosmos itself. Al- though this perception of reality is nowhere within the domain of the shibboleths of Western scientific thought as it has developed since Descartes, I have also come to understand that Western scientific thought is highly provincial, racially biased, and- because it is not informed by a perception of wholeness-incapable of solving the actual problems of life. In fact, Western scientific thought has been one of the key factors leading the human race onward to its great act of self-destruction-a self- destruction employed through the instrument of technology. In my next book Earth Ascending: An Illustrated Treatise on the Law Governing Whole Systems (1984, 1988, 1996), I was able to make a profoundly radical break with the restraints of the Western scientific and academic modes of thought. Combining the artistic and aesthetic qualities of Mandala and The Feminine, Spacious as the Sky with the philosophical and scientific concerns of The Psychophysical Aesthetic and The Transformative Vision, I define and describe the human situation as a function of the geology, or biogeology, of Earth understood as a whole system. Without knowing it, I had defined the human presence in Earth's geology in a way very similar to that of the Russian biospheric scientist V. I. Vernadsky in his analysis of the biosphere. Cul- ture, civilization, and even technology are seen as features and functions of the larger evolving biogeological process of the whole system Earth, while time and conscious- ness are defined as functions of a larger planetary regulating system called the psi bank. In the analysis of Earth Ascending, the feminine psychic side of consciousness is referred to as the AC, Aboriginal Continuity, while the male, rational techne side is defined as the CA, Civilizational Advance. The historical process represents the in- creasing dominance of the CA to the final exclusion of the AC-the triumph of industrial man over the indigenous peoples. The most critical moment in history was the atomic destruction of Hiroshima, August 6, 1945, when through its technology the impact of human thought permanently Preface. xiii"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"affected the geological makeup of the Earth. The events before Hiroshima are chro- nologically defined as P.A., pre-atomic, and those after as A.H., After Hiroshima. But more than defining the process of history within the context of Earth's cosmogeology, Earth Ascending also describes the post-historic future as a condition of harmonic syna- esthesia-harmony of the senses-defined by a new scientific system called radiosonics. The key to this new system of scientific endeavor is synchronicity or synchronization of our mind and senses in time. The problem left open by Earth Ascending was the precise nature of time and the timing of the radical break in the historic continuum, now known as the Inevitable Event-the culmination and dramatic conclusion of a process begun at Hiroshima. After the Inevitable Event we are liberated into post- history and the possibility of the radiosonic science of the future. In The Mayan Factor: Path Beyond Technology (1987), I was able to supply the basic ingredients for an understanding of time and the timing of the radiosonic future. Go- ing beyond the parochial limitations of Western science and the self-inflated progres- sivist thinking of the Western mind in general (that states \"anything that advances technology is an absolute advance over anything that was thought of or occurred in the past\") I was able to finally bring to light the synthesis of many years of study of the time science of the ancient Maya. Here, in the mathematical calculations of the Maya with their unique vigesimal mathematics-counting by twenty and not by decimal ten-lay the basis of a vast and grand science of time. So grand is this science that its conceptions of time dwarf anything the Western imagination could conceive. While the Western concept of time is linear and predicates an unceasing ascent into a progressively technological and mechanistic future, Mayan time science is predicated on the knowledge of time as the universal factor of synchronization. The Western conception of time is not in accord with the actual cyclical and synchronis- tic nature of time, and so the whole apparatus of Western civilization is doomed to reach its own breaking point: the Inevitable Event. Mayan time science posits a pre- cise measure of the historical cycle, the most recent and climactic stage of Earth's evolution, as a time fractal of thirteen baktun cycles, each 144,000 days in length, spanning the JulianiGregorian years 3113 B.C.-A.D. 2012. According to Mayan time science, the efforts based on an erroneous time conceptualization are bound to fail prior to the cyclic end-point of 2012. Thus, the Inevitable Event is also a conse- quence of the failure to understand or to even acknowledge the actual nature of time due to a totally false and mechanistic timing sensibility. In this lies the cause of the apocalypse of Western thought and theology. The problem left unresolved by The Mayan Factor was the precise methodology for changing tracks, for switching Western dominated global civilization away from xiv. Preface"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"the track of an erroneous, mechanistic time-based technology and toward the natu- ral order of time-the path beyond technology. Here my efforts took me to a point beyond reason. Why or how? Let me explain. As an exposition of Mayan time sci- ence, in preparation for the 2012 ending of the thirteen baktun cycle of history, The Mayan Factor is predicated on the occurrence of a real time event, the Harmonic Convergence \"global peace meditation\" of August 16-17, 1987. The timing of the Harmonic Convergence was prophetic. It augured the fulfillment of the prophecy of Quetzalcoatl (947-999) known as the Thirteen Heavens and Nine Hells. The Har- monic Convergence completed the ninth and last Hell cycle, and ushered in the final twenty-five years of the thirteen baktun cycle. The Harmonic Convergence was a Mayan wake-up call answered by millions of earthlings. Exactly forty-two years and ten days after Hiroshima, and fourteen years and twenty-six days before the Inevitable Event, the Harmonic Convergence was lo- cated by time to occur precisely when it did. Prophecy transcends reason because it is totally of time, which is of the fourth dimension; prophecy nevertheless affirms with unerring logic that which has been, and that which will be brought about, as being of the same karmic cause and effect stream. It was this matter of prophecy in the aftermath of The Mayan Factor that brought my literary efforts and my own life journey to another stage of development. Proph- ecy comes with a mantle-if not, then you are classified as a madman. The prophecy of the Harmonic Convergence, as well as of the entire text of The Mayan Factor, bore the mantle of the prophetic stream of the Chilam Balam, the jaguar priests, the wizard knowers of the \"night script.\" By correctly fulfilling the prophecy of the Thirteen Heaven and Nine Hell cycles, 843-1987, and by writing and putting to- gether the mathematical codes of The Mayan Factor, and before it, of Earth Ascending, I, Jose Argiielles, had assumed the mantle of the prophetic tradition of the Chilam Balam. Mind you, this was nothing overt nor the least bit conscious, for little did I then know that my next life task was to decode the essence of the Chilam Balam proph- ecies and to define the time science of which these prophecies are a manifestation.! The Harmonic Convergence affirmed the karmic repercussions of Hiroshima by bringing forward the ancient Mayan prophetic tradition of the Chilam Balam. By precisely locating this prophetic tradition in a contemporary moment -a media event, no less-the unlocking of its final prophecies was triggered for the purpose of com- pleting the cycle of history: 2012 and beyond. Like any major media event, the Harmonic Convergence was an enactment within the noospheric unconscious of humanity-the telepathic whole that resides in Earth's mental envelope. So it was that on June 23, 1987, the Wall Street Journal ran the Preface. xv"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"front page story on the Harmonic Convergence. Yet due to the mental obscuration accompanying the final stage of global industrialization, the Harmonic Convergence was an event that the WillI Street Journal and the rest of American media conve- niently forgot when it came to their review of the century in the year 2000. Today, just weeks after the Inevitable Event, the collapse of the World Trade Center towers, the words of that article are most prophetic: \"Mr. Argiielles says the choice between a 'new age' and all-out destruction is ours, and we had better decide.\"2 Though the prophecy was discounted, true to form, the words of the messenger remain to haunt those who spurned the message. The prophets and sages of the Maya, and of the New World in general, are a complement to those of the Old World, a further manifestation of the planetary dialectic of poles and hemispheres. If the judgment day apocalypse is the focus of the Old World prophecies, especially those ofIslam and Christianity, those of the New World similarly pinpoint an end time whose denouement is chronicled as the date 2012. It was the prophecies of the sage and culture hero, Quetzalcoatl (947-999), that brought about the Harmonic Convergence, while it was the wisdom of Pacal Votan (603-683) that informed the actual text and scientific time mappings of The Mayan Factor, and the image of his tomb adorns the cover of the original book. In a similar manner, it was the tradition of the Chilam Balam that created the prophetic vision of the synchronic order to be realized as the Law of Time. I was hardly aware of the personally transformative factors at work within me after the Harmonic Convergence media swell began to subside, when two events occurred that augured a major change in my perceptions, activities, and literary output: the Wall Street stock market crash of October 19, 1987, and the death of my eighteen-year-old son,]osh, ten days later, on October 29,1987. In analyzing why the 1987 stockmarket crash happened, the lead story in USA Today about this event concluded by posing the question: Was it the Harmonic Convergence that somehow caused the stock market to crash? As I pondered why the answer to this question must be in the affirmative, as well as the implications of this analysis-remembering full well that the breaking story on the Harmonic Convergence first appeared in the TVtlll Street Journal-news came of my son's sudden death in an automobile accident. Synchronically, the stock market crash and my son's death were part of one event continuum. As tragic as the circumstances of his death were, my son had liberated me from any further compunction to lead a normal life, and to pursue, instead, this matter of Mayan time science and its calendars of harmony. In homage to my son, I completed what I first thought would be a popularization of The Mayan Factor, a book entitled Suifers of the Zuvuya (1988). Instead of being a popularization or even xvi. Preface"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"a sequel to The Mayan Factor, Surfers turned out to be a series of autobiographical tales of interdimensional travel-zuvuya surfing in the fourth dimension. This \"flight of fantasy,\" was my literary farewell to the limitations of reason and a life of comfort. Inner destiny pushed me to the next stage in my pursuit of the unitive science-the discovery of the Law of Time. This journey of discovery, the findings of which are the underpinnings of the present work Time and the Technosphere, took me and my wife and partner, Lloydine, to physi- cal and mental places that were far from anything we had once deemed conventional. Because of this, I had ample opportunity to write and to create, and I did so, freely and without any restraints. I no longer sought any conventional means to communicate. I was now operating prophetically, on behalf of the noosphere-Earth's mental envelope. There is a consistency to the stream of prophetic revelation, summarized as the codes of the Law of Time. This revelatory stream begins with Earth Ascending and The Mayan Factor, comes to flower with The Dreamspell: Journey of Times hip Earth 2013 (with Lloydine Arguelles, 1991), and is completed by all aspects of the Telektonon Prophecy, including the Thirteen Moon/28-Day calendar (1993-2000). This prophetic stream is emphatically a galactic revelation of the same base of know 1- edge that produced the Mayan civilization of ancient Mesoamerica. The new revela- tory stream is known as the Wizard's Count, or \"reformulated Chilam Balam.\" It was this prophetic stream and its year-bearer count that established the validity of a fifty-two year cycle correlated to the Gregorian July 26. The purpose of the Chilam Balam year-bearer count was to establish a basis for understanding that there exists a synchronic order of time, completely apart from what is usually referred to as the Long Count, the linear count of days of the thirteen baktuns of the cycle of history, 3113 B.C.-A.D. 2012. After a long break in the tradi- tion of the Chilam Balam, the year-bearer count was prophetically reformulated to prepare for the Harmonic Convergence and the subsequent revelation of the Telektonon prophecy of Pacal Votan. As the new Wizard's Count, this count was intuitively recalibrated precisely so that July 26, 1987, would be White Galactic Wizard; July 26. According to The Mayan Factor, July 26, 1987: White Galactic Wiz- ard, marks the first of the twenty-six years of the Harmonic Convergence. This date marks the conscious ascendance of the prophecy of galactic culture and the coming of the Earth Wizards-the race of galactic wizards on Earth. In 1988, the year following the Harmonic Convergence, in attempting to create an everyday \"Mayan calendar,\" I came upon the next stage of the discovery of the synchronic order. On the Gregorian calendar, 1988 is a leap year. I perceived that to accommodate February 29 would throw the year-bearer count off by one day, ruining Preface. xvii"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"the harmony of the system. Reviewing the Chilam Balam texts, it was clear that leap year was never considered, much less counted in the year-bearer count. Without an intercalary leap year date, the four year-bearers-Seed, Moon, Wizard, and Storm- coded by the numbers 1-13, remained in sequence, maintaining and assuring the harmony of the system, where every fifty-two years equals seventy-three 260-day spins, no two days are the same, and the entire 18,980 days of the cycle repeat every fifty-two years in an upward moving spiral of time. For the first time in my work, the issue of the Gregorian calendar as a system came into question. Following this observation came the discovery of the mathematical codes gov- erning the synchronization of the 260-day cycle with the 365-day cycle, the conse- quent discovery of the artificial 12:60 and the natural 13 :20 timing frequencies, the recognition and resurrection of the Thirteen Moon/28-Day calendar, and the full exposition of the Dreamspell codes of fourth-dimensional time. I presented these discoveries in Dreamspell: Journey of Time sh ip Earth 2013. The Dreamspell, being the manifestation of the knowledge base of galactic culture, completely encodes the Wizard's Count. Dreamspell: Journey of Times h ip Earth 2013, the presentation of the codes of fourth-dimensional time as a \"tool kit\" with an accompanying \"script\" and guidebook, is a break of such radical form from the prevailing paradigm that, as of today, it is still unfathomable to many people. The galactic Dreamspell tool kit is a primary tool for the galactic culture that is just now beginning to unfold in the wake and shadow of the collapse of the Twin World Trade Center towers. This text prompted me to write two more books. The first, Arcturus Probe: Tales and Reports of an Ongoing Investigation (1 992, 1 996), is a deep reverie that picks up where Suifers of the Zuvuya left off and documents the interstellar, interplanetary psycho-cosmological roots of the Dreamspell of fourth-dimensional time. The second book was written as A Treatise on Time Viewed from its Own Dimen- sion, but first published in English as the Call ofPacal Votan: Time is the Fourth Dimen- sion (1992, 1996). In this highly scientific, mathematical treatise I was able to accommodate the Dreamspell codes of the Law of Time to an analysis of the biosphere and the biosphere-noosphere transition. This work also represents my first integration of the actual thought and principles o f V. I . Vernadsky. Through the efforts that constituted the discovery of the Law of Time, much of which was assisted by my partner and wife, Lloydine, I was finally able to begin to understand the methodology for accomplishing the paradigm shift-or psychic pole shift-of which humanity was so in need, at least from the perspective of the bio- sphere. By providing the mathematical basis for establishing the \"biomass constant,\" Seventy-three 5 day subcycles correlated to the measure of the solar year, I had xviii. Preface"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"found a way of grounding the fourth-dimensional mental order of time, the synchronic order, in the actual third-dimensional biogeochemical cycles of the biosphere. This was like casting a harpoon of time from the noosphere and landing it in a precisely measured form in the annual turning of Earth's biospheric mantle. And this was accomplished precisely because of the intrinsic harmonic cycles and patterns of the DreamspelllWizard's Count. For this reason, by 1993, it was incumbent upon me to test the hypothesis of the Law of Time that the human race was destroying its biosphere due to operating according to an error in time, and that only a shift in its experience of and perception of time would save it from such destruction. This shift in time is defined as the calendar change. The Law of Time presents such a radical critique of Western sci- ence, of its concepts of time, and of the civilization which it supports, that I could not tackle the problem from its center, but from its periphery, moving inward to the point of the Inevitable Event. Beginning in Latin America, then spreading to Japan, Western Europe, Russia, and finally North America, we established a movement to change the everyday perception of time, instilling profound meaning behind the effort to reform the calendar. In this way, we took on the responsibility of organizing the World Thirteen Moon Calendar Change Peace Movement. Part and parcel of this, beginning in 1993, was the decoding of the prophecy of Pacal Votan, the inspiration of The Mayan Factor. Known as the Telektonon, Earth Spirit Speaking Tube, this prophecy is the full realization of the Law of Time and the synchronic order. As much science as it is prophecy, the Telektonon defines the Tower of Babel as the root of the error in time, and the Inevitable Event as the necessary result of not relinquishing false time. At the same time, the Telektonon provides codes and tools of analysis which are in complete accord with an understanding of the technosphere- noosphere as an evolutionary continuum in which the Inevitable Event is an act of moral consequence and natural law revealing the basis of a new cycle of harmonic order. I would also be remiss at this point if! did not inform the reader that, by prophecy's prerogative, this text is also literally punctuated by a perspective that can only be described as \"Quranic.\" Late in 1993, my immersion in the prophecy ofPacal Votan became sychronically linked to my immersion in a study of the Quran, or Holy Quran as it is sometimes called. I have taken seriously the claim that the Quran is the final revealed text (A.D. 610-632) for humanity. I have studied it following the dic- tum: \"Quran, the whole Quran, and nothing but the Quran,\"3 as the basis of genu- ine Islam-submission to the will of God. I have found it more than sufficiently true that the Quran is a scientific text, and contains nothing that contradicts science. More profoundly, my study has given rise to my own personal ethic: duty to God is Preface. xix"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"the highest cause. It is the cultivation of this attitude, combined with many years of practice of Buddhist meditation, that have brought me to my present point of view, which is visionary and spiritual throughout-and, as a result, has endowed me with my own view on the current global dialectic. That the new, and final, global dialectic is found in the tension between the forces of globalization (materialism) on the one hand, and that of the civilization of Islam (spirituality) on the other, is now a well-documented fact.4 Of course, gener- ally speaking, in the West, we see it only from the materialist side of the dialectic. The perspective which informs me, and consequently this book, is definitely from the other side of the dialectic. Though in no way condoning terrorism- I am a non- violent pacifist by persuasion-the motives of the terrorists stem from a philosophy and worldview with which I am in sympathy. Yes, the Inevitable Event was also a profound theological moment, and what we are witnessing in the present World War is the battle between the religion of choice and the religion of submission. We cannot necessarily assume that the religion of choice will prevail. In fact, from the perspective of the biosphere-noosphere transition, it is the religion of submission that is most in accord with the spiritually-beckoning future. As a preface to this book, I have found it mandatory to write this brief literary autobiography, often couched in a terminology that jumps ahead of the story, solely to demonstrate that the actualization of the noosphere corresponds to the stages of attainment and transcendence of one human's life journey in pursuit of the truth. Only in this way could I cultivate the noospheric perspective, voice, and point of view that was necessary for the writing of this text. In this perspective, the noosphere is a condition of non-anthropocentric consciousness. My journey, thus documented, is merely one way the noosphere has found to become conscious, asserting the Law of Time's purposive axiom: to make conscious what had been unconscious. The voice and method of the noospheric perspective are inseparable from the topic of this book, Time and the Technosphere. By analyzing the timing and structure of the technosphere, the noospheric point of view becomes conscious.

There is a good reason for that, too: The destruction of the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center and the attack on the Pentagon marked a point beyond the comprehension of the current belief system in every way. To say that the event was mind-blowing is an understatement. But if it was mind-blowing-which it truly was-that means that a whole belief system was knocked off of its foundations, and only a new belief system can supply the answer. A higher, more all-encompassing belief system-a new paradigm-is what is needed if we are to really understand what happened on 9-11. Belief systems, believe it or not, are functions of time. What you believe defines the time you are living in. Any belief system is held in place by the calendar and sense of time in which it is encoded. 9-11 means September II-it also means 911 emergency, planetary emergency in this case. \"9-11 we will never forget\" was a com- mon slogan appearing on bumper stickers and store windows after the event. The words or concepts \"Tuesday, September 11,\" \"9-11\" and even \"911\" are all functions of the same belief system. So is \"2001,\" the first year of the highly touted \"third millennium.\" But the third millennium of what? The third millennium since the birth of Christ. This means that the belief system whose mind was blown was the Christian millennial belief system encoded in the Christian calendar, the Gregorian as it is properly called. Does this mean that the foundations of 2000 years of belief were blown away, shattered with the terrifying collapse of those Twin Towers? Eas- ily that many years, maybe as many as 5,000 years, or perhaps even the entire history of civilization as we know it came unhinged that fateful day, the day of the 9-11, the day of the Inevitable Event, to borrow a phrase from the Holy Quran, the day the Apocalypse announced itself, showed up on the morning television, quite without warning. (See plate 1, The Invevitable Event and the End of History.) In meditating upon the meaning of the Inevitable Event, it is natural to ask: What made this event so inevitable? It is not just from the perspective of American Foreign Policy, or that of its economic free market monetary politics, that this event was inevitable. More profoundly, this event was so inevitable because it seemed to smack of some form of retribution for the breaking of fundamental laws of nature, or even of Divine Law. And isn't the retribution for transgressing Divine Law a form of apocalypse, a standing naked, a revelation, an evocation of the fall of the Tower of Babel, no less? Yes, that is why it was so shocking-it was the Inevitable Event because the apoca- lypse is as inevitable as it is without warning. But apocalypse- a word no one wanted 2 . 9-11, The Inevitable Event"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"to use to describe the event, because to use it would be to admit that it was all over- is only one side of the coin. There is another side to the coin of the Inevitable Event- and that is what this book is about. There is something beyond the Apocalypse, there is something larger going on, and that also scares people. Things are out of their control. Isn't this why, instead of looking at it, or contemplating the event, a policy of war was immediately instated as a principle of revenge-for what and against whom? What is going on is time-time is always going on, or time is always coming together. Or time is always changing. The apocalypse, too, is about time-the end of time- which is even more frightening to most people. But the end of whose time? The new paradigm we need to explain 9-11 should be a paradigm that is all about time. I who speak know, because I have spent most of my life studying time, and the effects of human time which you call history. For many years now I have been living an experiment in time, but a time most of you do not know. So I have some answers that will put 9-11 in perspective for you. I am the stranger from the other side of the wall of mechanized time. I have come back to make you familiar with the time your clock and your calendar shield you from. Because I know about the other time, the larger time, the cosmic time that governs the cycles of all that exists, I can tell you that 9-11 was the Inevitable Event. It had to happen precisely when it did, not be- cause nineteen terrorists planned it that way, but because the terrorists themselves were unconsciously programmed by the timing of Earth itself. Earth's timing pro- cess represents evolutionary forces as well as effects irreversibly set in motion by the human's own unconscious programs, programs governed by the human misperception of time and of its role in the cosmic order. Yes, Earth has its program of which our human history and all of its endeavors are only a part. This larger meta-program of Earth is called the biosphere, the scien- tific designation given to what is commonly and inadequately referred to as \"the environment.\" As such, the biosphere is a whole system composite of the sum of life and its organic and inorganic support systems spread out over the surface of Earth, hence bio = \"life\" + sphere = \"having the form of a globe.\" In a word the biosphere is a vast but fragile process which has been evolving itself for some two billion years on this little planet as it spins around its local star, the sun. But we humans, who only in 1969 first saw ourselves as a planetary being-the whole Earth beamed back at us via television by a rocket hurtling toward the moon-we humans have been generally so self-involved in our own interpretation of things that we have missed seeing the larger picture of which we are a part. This larger picture is the entirety of the bio- sphere which encompasses the evolution of life on Earth as a whole system process. The amazing thing is that most of us have never even heard of the biosphere much 9-11, The Inevitable Event. 3"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"less even know that we are a part of this whole system governed by laws and principles which we, in our self-made arrogance and ignorance, have but little understood. From my experiment in time, seeing and studying the human as part of the larger self-evolving fabric of the biosphere, I came to the conclusion that the human is living in a time apart from the rest of the biosphere-an artificial time whose climax and termination is inevitable, for nothing artificial can withstand the force of truth. If the human is living in artificial time, the clock is an artifact whose system of measure has nothing to do with natural cycles but is a totally abstract standard, then there must be something called natural time. I will go even farther and state that not only is there natural time, but that there is a law governing natural time, and that is the Law ofTime.]ust as Newton only discovered gravity some 300 years ago, though gravity has always existed, so the Law of Time has always been in operation, even though it was just recently discovered. It is the Law of Time that governs the en- tirety of the biosphere and everything else in the universe according to principles which are only dimly known to us, principles like synchronicity and telepathic in- stantaneity. Yes, to understand what really happened on 9-11 you have to understand the Law of Time and how it governs the biosphere-of which our rampant human civilization is inescapably a part. The Law of Time is formulated very simply, and in some people's way of think - ing, rather unscientifically as T(E) = Art, \"energy f actored b y time equals art.\" All phenomena in the material world represent some state of energy, and every state of energy is governed by time, the resultant product of which is always something beau- tiful or elegant. Have you ever seen an ugly sunset? A hideous flower? Even if you examine a scorpion with some objectivity you will be amazed at the flawless and elegant manner in which its parts are organized. Yes, all of nature is organized by time to produce in you the sensation of beauty. And time itself, well, believe it or not, time is a frequency, and a frequency is not measurable by a clock. The Law of Time states that time is the universal frequency of synchronization. It is the nature of time to synchronize and to maintain all things in a condition of synchronization. Synchronicity, then, is the experience of real time. When we say that time is a frequency, we can be more precise and say that time is a universal constant ex- pressible by the mathematical ratio 13 :20. That is, the 13 :20 ratio is the frequency of synchronization. Of course, most people have never even heard of the Law of Time much less comprehend what the 13:20 ratio might mean. But then, that again gets to the root of the problem, or rather, the dilemma: If humans are living in their own time apart from the rest of the biosphere which is governed by the natural timing frequency, 4 . 9-11, The Inevitable Event"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"how could they ever know about the Law of Time? The humans are all a little like Mrs. Malaprop in the play by Moliere who learns to her surprise that she has been using grammar all of her life-though it is much more serious than that. So we humans are with the Law of Time-it has been operating throughout history with- out our awareness of it. Because of this, its way of making itself known to us was the infamous 9-11. Yes, in the analysis of the Law of Time, the 9-11 marked the end of artificial time. Living in ignorance of the Law of Time and of the true nature of time, the human species constructed its own concept of time which is based on the clock with its 60-minute hour and the Gregorian calendar with its maddening array of un- evenly numbered months. Hence, the paradigm of the artificial timing frequency is defined by the ratio 12:60 (twelve-month calendar, 60-minute hour) -in contrast to the 13 :20 ratio of natural time. If the artificial mechanistic and irregularly measured time sets the human race apart from true or natural time, does this not also establish the fact that the human race is living an error in time? Only by living such an uncon- sciously assumed error could the human race arrive at such an apocalyptic moment as the Inevitable Event-inevitable because any deviation from the truth has an in- evitable moment when the truth rebounds in some dramatic or even apocalyptic way. Is it possible that the entire construct of modern civilization, so devastating to the biosphere, is a function of this error in time? Is modern civilization like a time warp, a bubble of artificial time that suddenly got popped on the 9-11? Back in the 1990s, now seemingly so long ago, I was traveling around the planet on behalf of the Law of Time and the biosphere, and making my observations re- garding the effects of artificial time from a planetary whole systems point of view. I saw that even though the human species had evolved - or devolved, as the case may be-into a cultural hybrid which I call the planetary human, the object of the much touted \"globalization,\" I saw that the consciousness of this cultural hybrid was any- thing but planetary. This schism between the propaganda of globalization and the actual sectarian and fragmented state of consciousness of the hybrid human was fur- ther exacerbated, I observed, by the potently unconscious effects ofliving an error in time. Ironically, if the Inevitable Event left many of us in the dark, it has brought the Law of Time into the light. To elucidate let me quote here from a text I wrote in 1996, and which I think will give us a point to expand upon in order to bring the Inevitable Event into sharper focus, while allowing me to define some of my terms: \"Through an error in time, the human species transforms its artificial construct, civilization, into a global technosphere: the sum product of industrial mechanization of its biological functions. Because of human adaptation to the irregular mechanized 12:60 9-11, The Inevitable Event. 5 - -----------------"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"riming frequency, the technosphere runs counter to the laws of the biosphere, crearing a magneric instability between the primal crystalline and vital organic processes.\"2 The current explosion of the world crisis, stemming from the destrucrion of The World Trade Center Twin Towers, demonstrates the hypothesis of the Law of Time that states: operaring on arrificial and mechanisric timing standards will cause the human to deviate from natural rime to the point of its self-destrucrion, the end result of the magneric instability referred to in this reference. But here we have some further definirions to make. Let us start with a definirion of the technosphere, since that word is featured so prominently in the ritle of this book, Time and the Technosphere: The Law of Time in Human Affairs. While the term biosphere defines the enrirety of life as a single coherent unity, inclusive of its inorganic or semi-inert support systems such as the atmosphere and the hydrosphere, technosphere defines an artificial sheathe or membrane held to- gether by industrial technology as a whole system. This technological mantle is the sum of the processes devised by humans resulring from the application of certain scienrific and economic principles, especially during the last half century. The ef- fects of the technosphere are to supplant the organic processes of the biosphere with totally industrialized ones, resulring in a severe imbalance in the biosphere. This imbalance, the \"magneric instability between the primal crystalline and vital organic processes\" refers to the disruption of the delicate interacrion between the inert (crys- talline) and biological processes and structures which consritute the vibrant mecha- nisms and interacrive cycles of the biosphere. Phenomena such as global warming and over-popularion are symptomatic of the technospheric disruption of the natural order of the biosphere. The term technosphere, however, is actually just the middle term of a larger process defined as the biosphere-noosphere transirion. According to the principle figure behind the elaborarion of the laws of the biosphere, V. I. Vemadsky (1863- 1945), as an evolving structure, the biosphere is inevitably being transformed into a new geological and evolurionary condirion, the noosphere-Earth's mental enve- lope. In Vemadsky's analysis, the enrirety of the biospheric process can be described as a single biogeochemical unity. According to Vemadsky, due to man's transforma- rion of nature since the industrial revolurion, this biogeochemical unity has entered a state of combustion-an accelerated process of transformarion. It is this rapidly acceleraring geochemical combusrion-the net effect of industrializarion and its waste -that accompanies an evolurionary shift, the transformarion of the biosphere into the noosphere. But between the biosphere and the noosphere there is the technosphere, the intervening medium of transformation. 6 . 9-11, The Inevitable Event"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"So when we speak of the biosphere and the noosphere we must take into ac- count the technosphere. In actuality we must speak of the biosphere-technosphere- noosphere transition. In this context, the noosphere is the condition of the human mind purified of the error of time. And if the noosphere is the Earth's mental enve- lope, it could only be so because of a unified state of mind, the transformation of the hybrid planetary human into a genuinely spiritualized planetary being, the mind of the Earth no less-something that seems phenomenally utopian from the perspec- tive of today's evening news. How could this come about, this noosphere of a tele- pathically unified human consciousness? Again, the Law of Time supplies genuine answers. To begin with, it says, change your calendar, get back to living in harmony with the natural cycles of the rest of the biosphere-and the universe. If you don't, well, the destruction of the Twin Towers was just the first stage of the Apocalypse. But we still have a choice. The other side of the coin of the Apocalypse shown to humanity on prime time television on the 9-11 is entry into the noosphere. But we must first understand what is really going on, and then act intelligently. The mental climate in America is particularly difficult and strained now. In or- der to maintain a positive and constructive attitude of mind during this terrible time, I decided to write this book. As you can see, this book takes for its point of departure an analysis of the destruction of the World Trade Center (the actual hub of the technosphere) as the Inevitable Event defining the dynamic of the biosphere in its process of transforming into the noosphere. The analysis of the event in this light will give ample opportunity for presenting the key ideas of V. I. Vernadsky, in par- ticular the concept of the biosphere which he so single-handedly amplified and de- fined, as well as the cosmic ideas of other Russian thinkers which are little known in the West. I have already written about and given much thought to this matter in general, summarized in part in the First Planetary Congress of Biospheric Rights, held in Brasilia, Brazil in 1996, but nowhere have I written for a wider public audi- ence concerning the nature of the biosphere-noosphere transition. I feel it is especially important at this time to present an analysis of this event in a scientific context that is beyond nationalism and ideology, so that human beings can begin to understand that they are a function of the biosphere, but not necessarily its controlling mechanism. Of course, the Law of Time is the key factor involved in this analysis, and understanding the biosphere in the context of the Law of Time is absolutely critical for establishing the basis of an entirely new worldview and hierar- chy of values-the much awaited new paradigm. Like my thoughts on the biosphere-noosphere transition, my investigations of the Law of Time have also not as yet been presented to the general public. In fact, 9-11, The Inevitable Event. 7"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"you will find scarcely anyone who has even heard of the \"Law of Time.\" This is because my researches and investigations over the past decade which resulted in the discovery of the Law of Time were not conducted in any formal academic way, nor through any corporate or government sponsored grant or officially recognized research institution. The discovery of the Law of Time has been, nonetheless, a rigor- ous, life-consuming pursuit. The laboratory for its study was to be found in a phenomenological and anthropological investigation of the effects of mechanized time on various population groups absorbed in what is called \"modern civilization.\" The premise of this investigation is simple: it is an undeniable fact that the time of human civilization, governed by the clock and the Gregorian calendar, is not the same as the time of the rest of the biosphere. Artificial time is not the same as natural time. Or rather, artificial time establishes a frequency which governs the human species totally apart from the timing frequency of the rest of life. What are the ef- fects of artificial time and how do they define the nature of modern civilization? The answers to these questions open a perspective that has been scarcely considered. Yet this perspective is so clearly an essential factor in the description and definition of the human condition, that, in the wake of the tragic events and their ominous after- math, it now begs to be presented in a proper manner. Hence this book. Suffice it to say that the Law of Time in every respect answers the question posed by my previ- ous books and summarized in the single query: how will modern man escape the fatal consequences of the one-sided mechanization of his biological operations and the imminent destruction of his life-support system? Defining a planetary whole systems approach to the analysis of time in human affairs, the first postulate of my book A T reatise on Time (1996) concerning the prin- ciples and nature of time as the fourth dimension is worth quoting here, since it introduces the fundamental problem informing the investigation of Time and the Technosphere: Just as air is the atmosphere of the body, so time is the atmosphere of the mind. If the time in which we live consists of uneven months and days regulated by mecha- nized minutes and hours, that is what becomes of our mind: a mechanized irregular- ity. Since everything follows from mind, it is no wonder that the atmosphere in which we live daily becomes more polluted, and the greatest complaint is: \"I just don't have enough time!\" Who owns your time, owns your mind. Own your own time and you will know your own mind.3 It must be understood that the events of 9-11 were so historically unprecedented, so mind-bogglingly dramatic, that they require a large lens through which to fully 8 . 9-11, The Inevitable Event"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"interpret their meaning. The Law of Time is such a lens. Quite simply, the destruc- tion of the Twin Towers defines the limit of artificial time. If this is so, what can be expected following this world-shattering event? Because the Law of Time began with the premise of defining the difference between artificial time and the time of nature, the larger context of the biosphere was resorted to almost immediately. Be- ing the study of an ongoing and evolving phenomenon, the investigation of the bio- sphere by its principle researcher, V. 1. Vernadsky, pointed to another imminent evolutionary stage: the noosphere, the \"mental envelope of the planet.\" However, an intermediate stage was also perceived by researchers who followed Vernadsky, and it came to be called the technosphere, \"the technological envelope of the planet.\" The end or limits of the technosphere define the birth or beginning of the noosphere. With the events of 9-11, this is no longer just a theoretical concept but a vivid reality. As a species we are now undergoing this dramatic evolutionary moment, otherwise known as the biosphere-noosphere transition. It is for this reason that this book also presents novel definitions of time and pragmatic conclusions that can be employed by anyone if they so choose. If the root of the technosphere is artificial time and its proliferating mechanized constructs, then in the collapse of the technosphere, an event ordained by the laws of nature, there must be an orderly path or means for establishing the noosphere, also ordained by natural law. The Law of Time defines this orderly path as a conscious shift in the human timing frequency, away from artificial time and into universal natural time. This can only be accom- plished by a universal reform of time, known as the calendar change. If there were no such path, the conclusion to the collapse of the technosphere would be an un- bearable barbarism. By its nature, the topic of the book is cross-disciplinary and provocative-it is visionary history. I have been described as a \"spirituality historian\" and \"cosmic har- mony researcher.\"4 I believe this description also characterizes Time and the Technosphere, which does present a solution, a new world paradigm, if you will. A new paradigm has been awaiting humanity ever since the notion of paradigms was first raised by Thomas Kuhn in 1964, in his book The Nature of Scientific Revolutions, or even earlier by Vernadsky and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin in their invocation of the noosphere. To be truly new, such a paradigm could hardly be expected to arise from traditional fields of thought or methods of research, be they quantum physics or microbiology. In fact, as I have often said, most people wouldn't recognize the new paradigm if it ran into them on the street. This is because people's consciousness and perceptions are basically very set and unexamined-as unexamined as the effects of the watch on their wrist or the calendar on their wall. In fact, one of the consequences 9-11, The Inevitable Event. 9"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"of the technosphere is the limiting nature of consciousness which remains un- changed despite the fact that technology is changing all of the time. But with the occurrence of the Inevitable Event, history has been punctured. Perhaps now the new paradigm can be perceived: the paradigm of natural time as the universal factor of synchronization. Although prompted by the stunning terrorist attack upon and consequent apoca- lyptic collapse of the World Trade Center Twin towers, these reflections are actually a synthesis of thoughts and explorations in the domain of time that I now find neces- sary to communicate in a coherent and organic form. The grand theme of this study is to understand how and why the collapse of the twin World Trade Center Towers was a biospheric event. Even so, the study of the Inevitable Event within the context of the evolution of the biosphere requires and leads us to still grander domains of thought-the historical, the theological, and the cosmological. The reason that these reflections and meditations spiral into ever grander domains of thought is due to the principle of analysis and the guiding factor employed in this study. This is the Law of Time, which is the fruit of a life-long research and pursuit of knowledge. It is the Law of Time that brings the biosphere into timely focus. The biosphere is scarcely known even to most educated people. As a bio- geochemical whole system in which the human is but one of the functioning compo- nents, the biosphere is an intricate unity with its own governing laws and principles. Without becoming conscious of how the human organism participates in the laws and principles of the biosphere, the human will continue to remain ignorant of the biosphere's existence and therefore will sooner than later reach a termination of its own evolutionary possibility. A demonstration of how the laws and principles of the biosphere, crystallized into a temporary and intermediate sheath called the technosphere, reached a climactic evolutionary point in the collapse of the World Trade Center towers will provide the means of educating in general concerning the biosphere. It will also allow us to elaborate on the meaning and nature of the technosphere, and the imminent transformation of the biosphere into the noosphere, the Earth's \"mental envelope.\" A fundamental purpose of the Law of Time is to expand upon the meaning and significance of the Inevitable Event, as well as upon the biosphere, technosphere, and noosphere in relation to the evolution of life and consciousness in the universe. To speak of an event being \"inevitable\" is to bring about a reflection on the nature of time, and even of the laws of cause-and-effect and karma. It is time that governs both cause-and-effect as well as the actions of karma. And it is time that dominates inevi- tability, because any such inevitable event is located in a very precise moment in 10 . 9-11, The Inevitable Event"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"time. But what actually is time? How does time \"locate\" events? And, once again, what is the Law of Time? As the criterion of natural time in which synchronicity is the norm, the Law of Time is the key that unlocks the reason why the Inevitable Event occurred when it did. By precisely locating it within the evolutionary continuum of the biosphere and in relation to its point of mutational shift, the Inevitable Event is placed into a greater context of cosmic comprehension by the Law of Time. Through the lens of the Law of Time we will be able to understand the relationship between the biosphere, the intermediate state of the technosphere, and the imminent stage of the noosphere. Defining the Law of Time as the factor of universal synchronization, the law by which all events in the universe are maintained in synchronic relation to each other, we approach the domain of a hitherto undefined realm, that of the synchronic order. As the unifying fourth-dimensional order of time in the universe, the synchronic order is measured and gauged by the 13:20 matrix. The mathematical coding of the Law of Time is entirely locked into this 13:20 matrix, otherwise known as the Har- monic Module or T zolkin, the basis of the sacred count of the ancient Maya. When we examine the Harmonic Module, a 13 x 20 matrix, we may well ask what does that have to do with time? It is obviously as different from a clock, as a tree is from a flagpole! When we examine the matrix carefully we see that there is a repetition of thirteen notations, the numbers 1-13, that occurs 20 times yielding 260 (13 x 20) units. Holding the 13:20 matrix together is a pattern which I identified in my book Earth Ascending (1984) as the binary triplet configuration, and in the Mayan Factor (1987) as the Loom of Maya. This pattern consists of 52 units, 26 on either side of the central or seventh vertical column. If you contemplate this 52-unit pattern you will see it is characterized by binary radial symmetry. This quality characterizes the entire matrix and defines the quality of fourth-dimensional time as radial and instan- taneous distinct from the current third-dimensional paradigm which defines time as being linear and sequential. The radial quality of fourth-dimensional time is what accounts for its being the factor of universal synchronization. This is very different from the sensation of the second hand as it sweeps around the clock, indicating the inexorability, not of time but of the mechanization of time! The 13:20 matrix be- comes potently useful as the means of establishing the synchronic order when it is coordinated with a genuinely harmonic timing standard, the Thirteen Moon/28- Day calendar. \"Time is the fourth dimension,\" is the famous adage attributed to Einstein. This statement notwithstanding, the modern notion of time is bogged down in the minutiae 9-11, The Inevitable Event. 1 1"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"of quantum mechanics and cessium clocks, in a hair-splitting myopia that cannot see the forest for the trees. The fact is that only time governs the whole order of the universe in a manner that transcends all spatial limitations, even those of the relativ- istic MinkowskilEinstein four-dimensional universe, which is confined by the speed of light. As the universal factor of synchronization, time is instantaneous and tran- scends light. This novel perception of time defines a new reality, the synchronic, of which our experiences of synchronicity are but a foretaste. The synchronic order described by the Law of Time poses the order of an entirely new science of time. To be realized and then applied, the science of time is dependent on two factors: a sudden and radical disruption of the historical continuum; and a genuine global- ization or planetarization of consciousness. The break in historical continuity is nec- essary to jolt the human consciousness from its stagnant and entropic state-defined by the Law of Time as the delimiting 12:60 frequency consciousness of artificial, mechanistic time-while the globalization of consciousness, intimately connected with this sudden discontinuity, is necessary for the application of this law at a plan- etary whole systems level. Of course, the radical disruption of the historical con- tinuum was provided by the collapse of the Twin Towers, and can actually be mapped in a description of the dialectical process of human evolution. If one studies Earth Ascending, Map 19, \"Binary Pulse of Psycho cultural Devel- opment,\" [shown on page 14] one can pinpoint the \"Inevitable Event\" of the radical historical discontinuity as the point at which the AC and CA currents cross over one another and switch polarity at the very top of the graphic depicting the \"historical\" process. What does it indicate, this point of psychic polarity switching currents? The historical dialectic is understood as the interplay of two \"currents\" of con- sciousness, AC \"Aboriginal Continuity\" and CA, \"Civilizational Advance.\" In the prehistoric phase, the consciousness is dominated by the Aboriginal Continuity or AC. This refers to the primary experience of the original human nature- life lived as a ritual or ceremonial round within the perimeter of the timeless present. But as the human enters the historical cycle, about which we will have more to say in later chapters, the CA becomes more predominant. As Civilizational Advance, the CA represents the tendency toward exclusive reliance on reason, logic and written means of communication. The Law of Time further defines the CA as being motivated increasingly by the artificial timing frequency of the 12:60 which gains in promi- nence until the final phase of the historical cycle, industrial globalization, when the CA has gained complete dominance of the biosphere. During this final stage, the global mental condition is defined as the involve- ment in secondary or artificial means of experience, furthered by the planetary 9-11, The Inevitable Event. 13"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"technosphere. The sum effect on consciousness of the advanced CA stage is defined as Psychosensory Elaboration or PSE, which in turn creates a psychoatmospheric density (PAD)-literally a mental cloud which obscures altogether the organic biopsychic reality of the human within the biosphere. From the point of view of a planetary pathology, this massive collective obscuring (CA) of the original nature (AC) defines a \"suicidal crisis point,\" a moment at which the subconscious instinct of the human being programs its own self-defeat in order to ultimately return to the organic reality of the biosphere and the simultaneous advent of the noosphere. Hence, the Inevitable Event: the radical break in the continuum of history. This moment of radical historical discontinuity occurred with the September 11,2001, terrorist attack on the twin towers of the World Trade Center-the very nerve center of late global industrialization-and the Pentagon, the supreme mili- tary fortress that defends globalization. If the fall of the towers symbolically augured the fall of Babylon and the Tower of Babel itself, the penetration of the Pentagon was no less symbolic. The fact that there was not one but two towers of Babel and a separation of some twenty minutes between the attack on each tower allowed the second attack to be viewed live on global television by about as many people on Earth as had ever witnessed anything at one simultaneous moment. By the end of the day, the scene had been repeated multiple times on virtually every television network on the planet. The unbelievable shock of the moment and its simultaneous perception, coupled with the symbolism of what was actually occurring, effectively rendered the break in the historical continuum as a profound mental event-a rupture of 5,000 years of history from the first Babylon to the last. The witnessing of the event on television meant that it was received immediately into the nervous system of virtually the en- tire species. This in itself is a noospheric moment-the mental envelope of the Earth made collectively and globally conscious in one instant of history-shattering signifi- cance, and hence, the genuine entry into post-history. Archetypally, the images of the towers collapsing with people flying or jumping off the upper stories, is a pure reflection of the Sixteenth Major Arcana card of the traditional Tarot which shows a tower being shattered by lightning, with bodies falling down from it. While the negative powers and forces grapple with their shattered dreams in the aftermath of the event, it is the time for the powerful luminescence of the noosphere to begin to activate the receptive cells of the human system within the now catalyzed biosphere. Fifty-six years after Hiroshima, the fall of the World Trade Center Tow- ers is the fatal puncture in the technosphere which is intended to reorient the human within the biosphere. ESP (extrasensory perception)-the opposite of PSE (psycho- 9-11, The Inevitable Event. 15"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"sensory elaboration)-is released in the instantaneity of the information reaching virtually every human being on Earth. This is the collective reactivation of the Ab- original Continuity current that has been disengaged and disempowered for so long by the Civilizational Advance. Civilization has finally been checkmated. Now the Revolution of Time must be completed in order to stabilize the biosphere, anchor the noosphere, and de-structure the technosphere. According to the Law of Time, the Inevitable Event was already embedded in the moment in which it actually occurred, like a flaw in a piece of glass that, upon concussion at the right pressure point, shatters all at once. In the case of the World Trade Center Towers and the Pentagon, we are also dealing with symbolic constel- lations of such potency that the very act of their shattering redefines the reality of human consciousness. In fact, the nature and problem of human consciousness as it has evolved historically is also at the root of this astonishing event. While it will take time for the collective human consciousness to fully grasp just how much its reality is being redefined, a vacuum now exists within the technosphere itself-a vacuum which awaits being filled by a new paradigm. Since the collapse of the Twin Towers actually represents the limits of artificial time, the new paradigm must rest on a redefinition of time altogether. This is the definition supplied by the Law of Time, the pragmatic application of which is the replacement of the irregular measure of the Gregorian calendar by the harmonic measure of the Thirteen Moon/ 28 - Day calendar. Because of its harmonic measure, the Thirteen Moon/28-Day calendar coordi- nated by the Harmonic Module is the new dispensation of time-reckoning for the human race. Rooted in the four recurring year-bearers of the Wizard's Count--:- which is not the same as the Mayan long count, nor the Julian count of modern science-the Thirteen Moon calendar exists for the establishment of the reality of the synchronic order as an entirely new method of knowledge and being for the entire human race as a cosmic medium operating within the biosphere.

Without such a basis in a lived mathematics of time correlated to the actual cycles of Earth, the noosphere could not be experienced nor fully realized. The successful completion of the bio- sphere-noosphere transition, then, is the triumph of the synchronic order, the con- scious elevation of Earth into the cosmic frequency of fourth-dimensional time. 16 . 9-11, The Inevitable Event"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"For all of this to come to be, however, is yet dependent on an analysis of the role of time in the creation of the technosphere and the subsequent comprehension of its limits and the potential for its de-structuring.

Seeing the Inevitable Event and, in fact, the entire human drama from the perspective of the biosphere, we are actually lifting the cruel trag- edies of contemporary reality above conflict and into a state where genuine laws of peace and harmony may shed their light of wisdom, illuminating the human drama with a higher understanding. One thing is certain: Unless we rise above our own humanity and cultivate a non-anthropocentric view-the view represented by the noosphere-there will be no release from the calamity that is now engulfing us. The point is not of maintaining the global economy, but of saving the biosphere. For the multilayered task of bringing a new understanding to light, defining the technosphere, and then the Law of Time, we shall begin with the former: defining the technosphere in the context of the evolutionary continuum of biosphere- technosphere-noosphere. 18 . Preliminary Definitions"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"VERNADSKY AND THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE BIOSPHERE It is amazing that the name V. I. Vernadsky (1863-1945) is so little known in the West, and that the word biosphere, as well as the laws and principles pertaining to it, are scarcely more known. To a large degree, this ignorance is due to the great cleav- age in human relations experienced as the Cold War. The biosphere, which was profoundly studied and scientifically articulated by the master Russian scientist V. I. Vernadsky, is actually the precise word for what in the West is vaguely referred to as the environment. But even more than being a precise and scientific description for what is meant by the use of the word environment, biosphere defines a whole system model of life on Earth, and because of that, also presupposes a whole system meth- odology and point of view. You cannot speak about the biosphere without entering into a world of discourse that is holistic or holonomic to the core. If one looks for Vernadsky's work in English, one will find precious little avail- able. His key work, The Biosphere, exists in two very different translations; the one published by Synergetic Press in 1986 is easier to read, while the other, the \"com- plete annotated edition\" published by the Far West Institute in 1998, is far more erudite, with a major bibliography and much supplementary information. The ear- lier translation was published in conjunction with the opening of the Biosphere II Project outside Tucson, Arizona. It is now a tourist site, with a bookstore that carries nothing by Vernadsky! Several other hard-to-find English-language books on the biosphere include the excellently informative Traces of Bygone Biospheres by Andrey Lapo (Synergetic Press and Mir Publishers, 1987), the flashy Biosphere Catalog (Syn- ergetic Press, 1985), and the much more specialized Energies: An Illustrated Guide to the Biosphere and Civilization by Vaclav Smil (MIT, 1999). Of these books, only Traces of Bygone Biospheres contains significant information about Vernadsky and his ideas. This scant list of available texts in English is hardly proportionate to the vast reality of the biosphere as a complex terrestrial dynamic in the throes of evolutionary change. The place and role of Vernadsky in Russian science is virtually equal to that of Einstein in Western science. A consideration of the achievement of each of these scientists also presents us with a dramatic contrast in perspectives, areas of interest, and consequent modes of analysis. The physicalist relativism of Einstein's legacy and its pursuit of the Big Bang is radically different in almost every way from the legacy of Vernadsky's work, which presents a biogeological worldview that is organically integrative and the basis of what in Russian science has come to be called cosmism. While the physicalist fascination of Western science has supported the materialism of modern Western thought and its way of life (which is actually an accelerating function of the biosphere's own internal processes), the whole system thinking of Preliminary Definitions. 19"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Vernadsky-characterized by the conception of a \"biogeochemical process\"- ironically supports a cosmic rather than materialistic worldview. To illustrate the Russian perspective and the influence of Vernadsky's work, we present the concluding thoughts of a book by another Russian scientist and philoso- pher, 1. Laptev: Each one of us requires the whole earth-today this is quite clear. But surely each one of us is required by the whole earth! And when these two mutually penetrating requirements, so distinctly revealed and intensified by the leap out into space, are satisfied, the new historical epoch will begin \"in which mankind itself, and with mankind all branches of its activity, . . . will experience an advance that will put everything preceding it in the deepest shade.\" (Fr. Engels, Dialectics of Nature) And people, no longer burdened by the thirst for money, will remember something that many of our contemporaries have forgotten: The only important things in life are such intangible qualities as beauty and wisdom, laughter and love. Nothing remains for us, members of a society the ideals of which are in unison with elemental geological processes and the laws of nature, but to wish that people the world over would recognize this as soon as possible.! Laptev's words-written twenty-eight years ago and precisely at the midpoint between Hiroshima and the Inevitable Event, as well as during the year in which the World Trade Center in New York City was finally completed and inaugurated (April 4, 1973)-simply and elegantly state the theme and point of view that we are pursu- ing. In fact, it is the Inevitable Event that prepares us for the new historical epoch. But first we must realize how we are organized by the biosphere in order that the technosphere may be transformed into the noosphere. The root of Laptev's cosmic vision lies in Vernadsky's succinct definition of the biosphere: \"The biosphere is the region on Earth for the transformation of cosmic energies.\" Although the word biosphere had been coined in the late nineteenth cen- tury, it was really only with Vernadsky's efforts that the biosphere became a viable description of the totality of life on Earth inclusive of its organic and inorganic sup- port processes. Vernadsky was trained as a geologist with a specialization in crystallography. He immediately absorbed the implications of Curies discovery of radioactivity (1896), and devoted many studies to the purpose of uranium and naturally occurring radio- activity within the Earth's geology. By the time of the First World War, Vernadsky had already written important texts such as Fundamentals of Crystallog;raphy and De- scriptive Mineralogy, and, along with Madame Curie, proposed an \"international ra- 20 . Preliminary Definitions"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"diography of Earth's crust.\" This was in advance of Alfred Wegener's definitive work on plate tectonics. During the time of the First World War and Russian Revolution, Vernadsky's attention turned toward the problem of living matter and its relation to the geochemistry of the Earth. From this was born Vernadsky's perception of the unitive biogeochemical process by which the biosphere maintains itself. In 1923 he published a \"plea for the establishment of a biogeochemical laboratory.\" In Paris, Vernadsky worked at the Insititut de Radium (Marie Curie) and became acquainted with Henri Bergson, who was then president of the International Com- mission of Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations. Through Bergson's circles, Vernadsky met often with the biologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (1881- 1955) and the philosopher Edouard Ie Roy (1870-1954), with whom Vernadskyjointly coined the word and concept of the noosphere. Although Pierre Teilhard de Chardin is credited in the West with the concept of the noosphere, defined by him as the \"men- tal envelope of the planet above and discontinuous with the biosphere,\" de Chardin's approach to the evolution of the noosphere as a natural consequence of vertebrate biology differs from Vernadsky's understanding in which it is the entirety of the biosphere that evokes the noosphere. The chief fruit of this fertile time in Vernadsky's life was the publication of the little book titled The Biosphere (1926). Demonstrating the synchronic ordering prin- ciple of the noosphere, it is interesting that the same year that saw the publication of The Biosphere also witnessed the appearance of J an Smuts noted book Holism and Evolution. Through most of the rest of his sometimes turbulent career (he often came under attack from hard-line bolsheviks), Vernadsky was to elaborate on the laws and principles of the biosphere, often expressed simply as problems in bio- geochemistry. At the same time, his influence as a holistic thinker began to spread through the Soviet Academy of Sciences. A list of a few of his later publications gives some idea of the breadth of his thought, and includes: Geochemistry, Problems in Bio- geochemistry I and II, On the Boundaries of the Biosphere, Goethe as Naturalist, Scientific Thought as a Planetary Phenomenon, Some Words on the Noosphere, and his never com- pleted work, The Chemical Structure of the Earth's Biosphere. Following the death of his wife in 1944, Vernadsky expressed the opinion that after the Second World War, American and Russian scientists should work more closely together. Early in 1945 a anuary 6), Vernadsky followed his wife to the grave. The Second World War ended, only to be followed by the Cold War (1947-1990). The critical collaboration between American and Russian scientists longed for by Vernadsky was soon to be buried in the ideological wasteland over which the super- structure of the technosphere would be constructed, a fact that in itself hastened the Preliminary Definitions. 21"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"acceleration of the biogeochemical processes bringing about the climax of the technosphere. Vernadsky did not live to witness the birth of the atomic era, which began only months after he died. But like Einstein in America, in 1940 Vernadsky-along with several other scientists, and mindful of the possible military applications-had prompted the Russian government to begin investigations into the possibility of deriving energy from nuclear fission. Yet it is most remarkable that by the time of his death, Vernadsky had almost single-handedly defined virtually every aspect of the laws and principles of the biosphere. This he always did with an eye to an imminent moment in the not-too-distant future when there would be a dramatic biogeochemical mutation or combustion, out of which the biosphere would somehow trigger the noosphere: Not at a crisis of nervousness do we stand now, not at a time for the vacillation of flabby souls; but at a great turning point in the history of scientific thought, at a crisis such as occurs but once in a thousand years, such as has not been witnessed for many generations. Standing at this point, with the vista of future achievements be- fore us, we should be happy that it is our lot to live at this time and to participate in the creation of tomorrow.2 Undoubtedly his sense of the great moment of transition came from the very fact that during the span of his life from 1863 to 1945, some eighty-two years, Vernadsky was able to witness firsthand the accelerating effects of man's thought- in the form of industrial technology and the machine-and its turbulent and trans- formative impact on the terrestrial biosphere. After all, as a geologist, Vernadsky was familiar with the long history of the Earth, and the impact of human technology on the biosphere was inescapably the most significant aspect of any study of the bio- sphere to the present time. So wrote Vernadsky: \"Only man transgresses the estab- lished order. . . upsets the equilibrium, though whether he materially cripples the transforming mechanism, or merely redistributes it, we cannot at the moment be sure.\"3 The \"transforming mechanism\" referred to is the biosphere itself, which Vernadsky had already defined as the medium or region for the transformation of cosmic energy on Earth. At its simplest level, the unity of the whole of living matter of the biosphere is the sum of its living organisms. These living organisms either directly or indirectly are continuously processing solar and cosmic radiation, trans- forming it into various chemical cycles that establish the atmosphere, most notably through photosynthesis and the oxygen and carbon dioxide cycles. The important point, however, in any consideration of the biosphere is the principle of unity: the 22 . Preliminary Definitions"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"biosphere is a unitive complex of cycles summarized as a single continuously trans- forming and slowly mutating biogeochemical process. In this single complex cyclical process, all of life-all of living matter-is a unity, a singular dynamic by which the biosphere can be considered as a living whole. From the plankton of the oceans to the trees in the forest and the human peering from his cave at the rising sun-all of this is a single unity. It is the interaction of the living matter with the inert matter that creates and establishes the attributes and dynamics of the biosphere as a whole, all of which are now in a heightened state of acceleration and transformation, for as Vernadsky put it in the conclusion to The Biosphere: \"The thought of the human species is a new fact which is turning the structure of the biosphere upside down after myriads of centu- ries.\" The structures and principles of the biosphere that man is now upsetting in- clude: the continuity and invariance of life on Earth; vegetation as a transformer of the energy of the sun; multiplication as a manifestation of transformed solar energy; propagation of life and the forces resisting propagation; and the unique relations of life to the inert matter of the biosphere, including the composition of living matter into two orders, plant life and the various biological animal species, inclusive of man. The first order of plants and bacteria constitute the mechanism for capturing the solar radiation and introducing the energy of the sun into the biosphere. The second order of biological life is a manifestation of the process of the transmission of energy through the vegetable world; that is, at a primary and fundamental level, animal life is dependent upon plant life for its existence. (See plate 2, Life Is the Transformation of Solar Energy.) All these principles for maintaining the equilibrium of the biosphere are func- tions of the dynamic of the different biochemical and geochemical cycles that main- tain life both on land and in the ocean, all of which are subjected to processes that we refer to as evolution, both geological and biological. The evolutionary mechanisms of life include the principle of the biomass constant and the biogenic migration of atoms. Both of these mechanisms refer to and define the continuity and invariance of life on Earth. That is, the quantity of living matter has remained roughly un- changed since the origin of life on Earth-the biomass constant. Furthermore, the amount of oxygen in the biosphere is equal to the amount of biomass. It is the pres- sure of the different species on each other with the resultant interactions and changes that checks the infinite propagation of anyone species at the expense of the rest, and causes the mutation and evolution of the different life forms. It is through the inter- mediate structure of the technosphere that the human is wreaking the greatest havoc on these principles that are intended to maintain the biosphere as a stable dynamic, Preliminary Definitions. 23"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"and by which the human constitutes a biomutation of unparalleled significance. The different stages of the mutation of life account for the biogenic migration of atoms: \"The evolution of different forms of life throughout geological time increases the biogenic migration of elements in the biosphere.\"4 The metamorphosis of dinosaurs into fossil fuel is an example of the biogenic migration of atoms-and of the intro- duction of \"free energy\" (the term for industrial waste and by-products such as carbon monoxide) into the biosphere, while at a more mundane level, it refers to processes such as metabolism, circulation, breathing, and so forth. To summarize, there are two biogeochemical principles. The first states: \"The biogenic migration of chemical elements in the biosphere tends towards a maximum of manifestation\"; this refers to the presence of life everywhere on Earth, as well as the principle of the pressure of living matter upon itself. The second biogeochemi- cal principle states: \"The evolution of species, in tending towards the creation of new forms of life, always move in the direction of increasing biogenic migration of the atoms in the biosphere. . . . The second biogeochemical principle regulates the course of evolution. A newly evolved species will survive in the biosphere only if it is sufficiently able and sufficiently active in furthering the migration of atoms. The organism cannot be considered apart from its medium. It is a part of the complex mechanism of the biosphere.\" Here Vernadsky concludes his study of the biosphere with a consideration of the laws regulating evolution that, for him, are to be sought in the mechanism of the biosphere and not in accidental circumstances. For this reason \"evolution must proceed, namely, in the direction of increasing consciousness and thought, and of forms having greater and greater influence on their surround- ings.\"5 This consideration leads Vernadsky to domains of philosophical or religious thought. Why? \"We are confronted with a new form of biogenic migration resulting from the activity of human reason. Human thought has changed in a brisk and radical manner the trend of natural processes and has even modified what we call natural laws. Con- sciousness and thought, despite the efforts of generations of thinkers, have never been defined, have never been given a physical basis, in terms of matter and en- ergy.\"6 And here Vernadsky poses a question that remained unanswered for him but that also leads to a consideration of the noosphere: \"How can processes which seem purely physical be affected by consciousness?\"7 Although The Biosphere is the initial statement and underlying basis of all Vernadsky's later thought and work, his final major study, Problems in Biogeochemistry II, translated and published by his son, George Vernadsky, at Yale University in 1944, states the final conclusions of Vernadsky on the intriguing relation of human con- 24 . Preliminary Definitions"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"sciousness-via its thought and projected dynamic, the machine-on the biosphere. These reflections provide us with a means for defining more precisely the nature of the technosphere and noosphere. FROM THE CREATION OF THE TECHNOSPHERE TO THE ADVENT OF THE NOOSPHERE Vernadsky developed the biosphere into a full scientific description of the sum oflife and its support systems on Earth, and was a co-originator of the concept of the noosphere, yet he seems never to have used the word or concept of the technosphere. In some of Vernadsky's descriptions of the relation of man and his thought on the biosphere, however, the technosphere is absolutely implied. In reading the follow- ing chain ofVernadsky's thought, we can discern what we refer to as the biosphere- technosphere-noosphere continuum: Man by his work and his conscious attitude toward life is remaking a terrestrial envelope, the geological domain of life, the biosphere. He is transforming it into a new geological state, the noosphere. He creates within the biosphere new biogeochemical processes that did not exist before. A planetary phenomenon, the biogeochemical history of the chemical ele- ments is notably changed. An immense new form of biogeochemical energy is represented by the technologi- cal work of man, complexly guided by his thought. It is interesting that the increase, in the course of time, of machinery in the structure of human society also proceeds in geometrical progression, just like the reproduction of any kind of living matter, man included. Statesmen should be aware of the present elemental process of transition of the biosphere into the noosphere. The fundamental property of biogeochemical energy is clearly revealed in the growth of free energy of the biosphere with the progress of geological time, especially of its transition into the noosphere.8 In this sequence of thoughts, we understand that Vernadsky, in his precise loca- tion in time, was himself the necessary voice of the biosphere giving rise to the noosphere. Put in another way, the very process that Vernadsky is describing-the transition of the biosphere to a new geological state, the noosphere-necessitated a coming into consciousness of itself, a self-reflective medium and voice. This self- reflective medium and voice of the biosphere-noosphere transition was Vernadsky Preliminary Definitions. 25"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"himself. In this observation we may understand that, although unconscious until it was made precipitant by the accelerated biogeochemical combustion itself, the or- der of the noosphere is none other than what the Law of Time defines as the synchronic order. As the structure of fourth-dimensional time, the synchronic order is a fluid, radial chronomantic structure in which time, telepathy, and consciousness are united in ways unpredictable to even the most advanced Western systems of mathematics. For Vernadsky the sum properties of the elements of the biosphere are the func- tions both of mathematics and of different kinds of geometries. It is of note that in the summation of the differences between inert and living bodies according to three factors, the first being energy and the second chemical manifestations, Vernadsky defines the third factor as \"differences in regard to space-time.\" Of this factor, Vernadsky writes: In considering space-time, however, the situation becomes rather involved. Here we enter, on the one hand, a domain not studied scientifically, and on the other hand, that substratum of all natural phenomena, namely their geometry, which the natu- ralist in his scientific work is wont to dismiss without attention. This substratum, the geometrical state of physical space, underlies all physiochemical phenomena and perhaps has an even deeper reality than that of the phenomena themselves.9 This deeper reality is the phenomenon of time itself, expressed through various geometries or geometrical principles, which informs the manifest phenomena of life. This is an obviously aesthetic factor as well as a cosm.Qlogical principle. The Dynamics of Time fully substantiates Vernadsky's perception of the geometrical ordering principle of the deeper reality of time: All geometric forms are radiative and derive from the fourth-dimensional radial matrix. All fourth-dimensional functions are radial in nature and imply a principle of center from which the structure is projected. . . Geometry is how fourth-dimensional time incorporates as third-dimensional form. The incorporation of time as geometrical form informs all of the inorganic and or- ganic orders of the realm of instinct. Time incorporated as the geometry of form is the principle example ofT(E) = Art. All forms and species participate in varying orders of geometry of form, both in their bodily structure and their forms of process.1o If the question is asked, Where is this deeper reality of fourth-dimensional time from whence the projective geometries are generated? then we must answer that it is here in the noosphere, the medium on Earth for the transformation of cosmic thought. Preliminary Definitions. 27"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"It is the noosphere that informs all of the forms of the biosphere, inert and living, as well as producing in all genuine thought a structure and an order that are continu- ously moving in the direction of greater consciousness. To even think about the noosphere is to be a reflection of it. As a noospheric medium, Vernadsky's life span was precisely timed to end when the global structure of the technosphere was about to be unconsciously constructed. The ingredients of the technosphere are indicated in the above-quoted passages as the planetary phenomena altering the biogeochemical history of the chemical ele- ments, transforming them into an \"immense new form of biogeochemical energy represented by the technological work of man, complexly guided by his thought.\" It is the increase, over the course of time, of machinery in the structure of human society that proceeds in geometrical progression-just like the reproduction of any kind of living matter, man included-and that constitutes the general nature of the technosphere. The growth of \"free energy,\" the often toxic by-products of the industrial transformation of raw goods into consumer products, becomes the hallmark of the technosphere, the transitional stage between the biosphere and the noosphere. It is this very point of the elemental process of the production of \"free energy\" and what it signifies in terms of the transformation of the biosphere into the noosphere that causes Vernadsky to call statesmen to attention. Why? As we know today, fifty- six years after Hiroshima, \"free energy\" in various manifestations has been causing danger signals to go off throughout the biosphere-from ozone depletion to global warming to nuclear radioactivity. What these danger signals have been telling us is that the techno sphere is coming to a point of its own exponentially accelerating biogeochemical combustion. Statesmen and politicians are advised by Vernadsky because the domain of their political rulership actually encompasses the everyday governing of the technosphere. But, alas, most people, statesmen included, are still unconscious of the existence of the technosphere, much less its role in relation to the biosphere and the forthcoming geological state, the noosphere. Hence, the Inevi- table Event. During much of Vernadsky's life, the geochemical combustion and release of \"free energy\" was just coming into its own. At his birth in the middle of the nine- teenth century, the world was not yet globally industrialized, and without a totally globalized industrial base there can be no technosphere. The critical span of the two world wars, 1914-1945, was for the purpose of establishing the world market-a total industrialized market and communications base for the expansion of technology and the creation of the unifying global structure of the technosphere. The inaugura- tion of the atomic age at Hiroshima, August 6, 1945, marks the precise beginning of 28 . Preliminary Definitions"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"the dual factors: the commencement of biogeochemical transmutation and combus- tion of the biosphere by the impact of human thought, the atomic bomb and release of nuclear radioactivity into the terrestrial atmosphere; and simultaneously, the be- ginning construction of the technosphere. The bomb created a point of critical self-awareness within the human organism as well as producing in that organism an unprecedented sense of its own power. It was this sense of power that necessitated the unconscious impulse toward putting into place the structure of the technosphere. Of course, at the outset the species was only responding to a new, uncharted world situation, fundamentally unaware both of what it was creating as well as of the fact that it was actually constructing some- thing in the nature of a transition between two geological conditions, the biosphere and the noosphere. It could be said that Hiroshima lit the fuse of the final stage of biogeochemical combustion, the technosphere being the inevitable structure needed for the fuse to detonate at just the right moment. In this regard the synchronic order of the Law of Time ordained a precise 56-year cycle for the existence of the technosphere: 1945- 2001. It is important to grasp that in this 56-year cycle the human population qua- drupled, expanding from 1.5 to more than 6 billion. The 56-year cycle divides into precise subcycles of twenty-eight years each. The first twenty-eight years, 1945-1973, begins with Hiroshima and ends with the completion of the World Trade Center towers in New York City. This marks the accomplishment of the creation of the \"World Market,\" the actual transformation of the biosphere into the technosphere. The sec- ond 28-year cycle, 1973-2001, spans from the dedication of the World Trade Center towers to their destruction by an act of suicidal planetary terror, and marks the phase of \"globalization\" -the absolute dominance of the materialist market economics, in- clusive of the dramatic end of the Cold War in 1990. The very midpoint of the second 28-year cycle is the Harmonic Convergence of August 16-17, 1987, exactly fourteen years after the dedication of the World Trade Center and fourteen years before the inevitable moment of their destruction. A profound statement of the way in which the Law of Time governs the entire biosphere, inclusive of the artificial and transitional structure of the technosphere, lies in the fact that the Gregorian calendar-an otherwise irregular and confusing pseudostandard of measure-is nonetheless coordinated by the Law of Time to repeat its cycle precisely every twenty-eight years. What this means is that the days of the week and months for the Gregorian calendar year 1945 repeated again in 1973, and yet a third time in 2001. The program prefiguring the Inevitable Event was already tested at Trinity Site (July 16, 1945), and established as the atomic destruction of Preliminary Definitions. 29"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Hiroshima (August 6, 1945) and Nagasaki (August 9, 1945).

We shall return to this point later in our discussion on the Law of Time and the role of calendars as macro-organizing, pro- gramming factors that control the functioning of the human in the biosphere. It is of special note that the very last work published before Vernadsky's death was the essay \"Some Words about the Noosphere.\" In his vision, Vernadsky could hardly have conceived of what was to occur first as the technosphere. Yet, he wrote in this last essay, published 1944: The historical process is being radically changed under our very eyes. For the first time in the history of mankind the interest of the masses on the one hand, and the free thought of individuals on the other, determine the course of life of mankind and provide standards for men's ideas of justice. Mankind taken as a whole is becoming a mighty geological force. There arises the problem of the reconstruction of the bio- sphere in the interests offreely thinking humanity as a single totality. This new state of the biosphere which we approach without our noticing it is the noosphereY By contrast, Teilhard de Chardin, in his most famous book, The Phenomenon of Man (1959), defined the noosphere as a \"new canopy,\" a \"thinking stratum\" that has been unfolding since the end of the Tertiary period, and has since been unfolding discontinuous with and above the biospheric world of plants and animals. Teilhard de Chardin also speaks of \"planets with noosphere,\" those worlds where the enlight- enment of humanity has become synonymous with the life of the planet as a whole system. The one path to the noosphere defined by a scientist in Marxist Russia and the other by a Catholic biologist both point to the same radically positive end vision of the evolution of humanity, a fact that in itself is a dissolution of any kind of contra- dictory dialectic. Only history is governed by the merciless dialectical movement of matter and thought, rich and poor, material and spiritual. Clearly, therefore, the noosphere is beyond or after history. In this regard then, the technosphere is the concluding stage of history, to be followed by the post-historical noosphere. The establishment of the techno sphere after his death notwithstanding, it is still important to listen to Vernadsky's idealism with regard to the noosphere: \"The prob- lem of planned, consistent activities which will aid us in mastering nature and ac- complishing the correct distribution of wealth, connected with the comprehension of the unity and equality of all people, of the unity of the noosphere, is now on the 30 .

It has become clear, and is more deeply penetrating the consciousness of mankind, that we now have a real opportunity to obliterate malnutrition, starvation, and poverty, to greatly diminish the incidence of diseases, and prolong human life to the maximum.\"12 Other thinkers like R. Buckminster Fuller have uttered similar state- ments, that we have all that is needed to adequately take care of everyone on the planet. It is important to understand why this optimism has yet failed to be substantiated. If anything, the inequality in wealth between that of the several hundred billionaires in the world and that of the poorest one-third of humanity, two billion humans, was never historically more disproportionate than it was at the moment of the Inevitable Event. This inequality of wealth, too, is a situation endemic to the very processes of the technosphere, otherwise known as the military-industrial complex. In 1970 an American scientist, G. E. Hutchinson, wrote in the Scientific Ameri- can, \"By noosphere Vernadsky meant the envelope of the mind that was to supersede the biosphere, the envelope of life. Unfortunately the quarter century since those words were written has demonstrated how mindless most of the changes wrought by man on the biosphere have been. Nonetheless, Vernadsky's transition in this deepest sense is the only alternative to mankind shortening its lifetime by millions of years.\"13 A similar assessment was put forward in 1979 by the Belgian ecologist P. Duvigneaud in his presentation \"Noosphere and the Future of the Vegetation of the Globe.\" In his address regarding the extermination of natural ecosystems made to the Twelfth International Botanical Congress, Duvigneaud makes one of the earliest and most prescient uses of the word technosphere: \"Thus, the noosphere, so dear to Vernadsky . . . is running the risk in reality of turning into the technosphere, or rather into 'the sphere of avidity,' governed by the spirit of fortune-hunting, by me- diocrity, by the absence of social consciousness, by the ideal of destruction and by the egotistic doctrine of 'after me, the deluge.\"'14 To be precise, it was in 1973, the same year of the Club of Rome's landmark publication The Limits of Growth, and of the establishment of the World Trade Cen- ter in New York, that the technosphere became a coherent structure smothering the biosphere, co-opting the noosphere, and coordinating the very processes of greed and destructive fortune-hunting abhorred by the ecologist Duvigneaud. Like it or not, the techno sphere was the inevitable result of the unloosing of the machine into the biosphere. It may be asked: if the machine is a projection of human biology, then what purpose does it actually serve in the biosphere, and what is it that actually produced it and keeps it going? Before turning our attention to the answers to these questions, let us first define the technosphere as being the artificial structure replacing the human civilization, Preliminary Definitions. 31"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"located mentally and physically in time as a force intermediate to and between the biosphere and noosphere. Defined by the Biosphere Catalogue (1985, p. 103), the artificial structure of the technosphere con- sists of five interlocking, coordinated systems that comprise an integral whole, both as a belief system and as an actual complex tech- nological dynamic and its coordinating apparatus. The five components, which we shall discuss at length in later chapters, are: 1) com- modity production, 2) the city, 3) energy, 4) transport, and 5) communication. And, according to the Biosphere Catalogue, the plan- etary core of this interlocking set of systems was none other than the World Trade Center's Twin Towers.ls As a planetary sphere, the technosphere takes its place with the other spheres or mantles comprising the structure of the Earth as a whole system. Beginning at the outermost etheric realm and proceeding inward, these spheres or mantles include: the electromagnetic field with its radiation belts, then the ionosphere, stratosphere, tro- posphere, atmosphere, technosphere, biosphere, land-ocean crust, tectonic plates, litho- sphere, outer and inner mantles, and finally the core, now known to consist of an outer tympanum, and within it a large octahedral iron crystal afloat in a sea of magma. As a planetary sphere, the technosphere negates time and consciousness as organic realities and replaces them instead with mechanization and marketing. Yet the technosphere is a product of mankind, and mankind is a function of the biosphere. The organization of life into biomes, large macro-ecosystems, is still evident, though in diminishing and withering proportion to the conquest of the technosphere. With the Final War now upon us, the question we must ask is: will the technosphere collapse before the biosphere or not? As catastrophic as it might seem, the collapse of the 32 . Preliminary Definitions"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"technosphere would actually be a blessing in disguise from which the noosphere could finally be realized. But if the biosphere collapses first as the result of the Final War on Earth, then the technosphere will be futile, pointless, and dead as well. These are most dire thoughts in these most dire of times. Yet if we can now finally understand and accept our role within and subordinate to the biosphere as a whole, then our chances for survival will be greatly improved. Let us consider again what Vernadsky has to say about the human's place in the biosphere: 1. Man, as observed in nature, like all living organisms, like any living matter, is a specific function of the biosphere, within its specific definite space-time. 2. Man in all his manifestations constitutes a regular part of the structure of the biosphere. 3. The explosion of scientific thought in the twentieth century has been prepared for by the entire history of the biosphere and has its deepest roots in the struc- ture of the latter. The civilization of \"cultured mankind,\" insofar as it is a form of organization of the new geological force which has formed in the biosphere, cannot be interrupted or destroyed, since it is a great natural phe- nomenon, historically, or rather, geologically corresponding to the estab- lished orderliness of the biosphere.16 If Vernadsky is correct, then the war we are witnessing is the inevitable conclu- sion of the biogeochemical combustion that consumes the technosphere and estab- lishes the pristine reality of the noosphere. This is especially true if we understand this war to actually be a geopolitical struggle for the control of the oil reserves of the Persian Gulf, or even more broadly, as the war between matter (globalization) and spirit (Islam), or more grimly, as Oswald Spengler put it, the final war between blood and money. This being the case, it is more important than ever to answer the two unresolved questions in Vernadsky's definition of the biosphere, the question of con- sciousness and the question of time. According to the Law of Time, the answers to the questions posed by Vernadsky are actually one and the same thing. \"How can processes which seem purely physical be affected by consciousness?\" The question asked by Vernadsky at the conclusion to The Biosphere is equaled by the unresolved issue of time discussed at the conclusion to Problems of Biogeochemistry JI.1n essence, Vernadsky declared, we know everything about the biosphere, its governing laws, principles, and functions, with the exception of the mysterious relation of time to the biosphere. Virtually alone among modern scientists, Preliminary Definitions. 33"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Vernadsky perceived that time actually has nothing to do with the metrics of space, and that \"time is not a dimension of metric geometry.\" This means that time is not only its own dimension-the fourth dimension-but that time must also have its own metrics and system of measure totally apart from the metrics of space. Minkovsky's and his predecessors' concept of time as the fourth dimension of space is a mathematical abstraction having logically no ground in scientific reality. Time is not a dimension of metric geometry. In geometry, time may be expressed vectorially, but it is obvious that such an expression does not embrace all of its properties in natural phenomena studied by the naturalist. . . The time of the naturalist is not the geometrical time of Minkovsky, nor is it the time of mechanics and theoretical physics. I? In Vernadsky's perception of time, there is a profound critique of the approach that has been established toward the measure-and hence understanding-of time in physicalist science. For Vernadsky, time is a function of an as-yet-unrealized geometry: \"This geometry would reduce all space to a point supplied by an infini- tesimal vector.\" Clearly time is a factor in all the functions of the biosphere, most evident in the biological life processes. Hence the Law of Time has been a regulating factor, the true nature of which we have been profoundly unconscious. Now here is an interesting reflection. If the biosphere as a whole system is tending toward a total whole system transformation into a state known as the noosphere, a fact perceived by Vemadsky during his lifetime, and the two unresolved issues are the issues of time and consciousness, both materially intangible dimensions, does it not seem correct that the resolution to these two issues will actually foster the manifestation of the noosphere, which is, after all, the mental envelope of Earth? And does it not also seem that as long as the two issues of time and consciousness remain in a state of ignorance or confusion within the mental functioning of the human order, that the vehicle of geochemical combustion, the technosphere, will tend toward its own dissolution until the issue of time and consciousness is resolved and clarified once and for all? The perilous passage, the biosphere-noosphere transition, may actually be de- fined as the consequence of operating in ignorance of the actual nature of time and consciousness. In this way, the techno sphere may be defined as the artificial com- promise in place of the true understanding of time and consciousness of the human order in the biosphere. Hence, the technosphere is the responsible intermediary agent creating the crisis of the noosphere. The solution to the questions of time and consciousness is thus the solution to the noospheric crisis, and the commencement of the grand new era, the true golden age of the whole Earth. 34 . Preliminary Definitions"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"HAVING DEFINED the technosphere as the intennediarystage in the biogeological continuum of the biosphere's evolution into the noosphere, we may now turn our attention to the unresolved issues of time and consciousness in the biosphere. These issues must not be seen as just the problems of humanity. Since humanity is a func- tion of the biosphere, the issues therefore relate to the biosphere becoming more conscious. It is the conscious aspect of matter that directs the biosphere toward its transfonnation into the noosphere. It is the discovery of the Law of Time that comple- ments and resolves the issues that were left unresolved in Vernadsky's definition of the biosphere and of its transformation into the noosphere. The question then arises: what is the Law of Time, and how does it define time and consciousness as mutually coordinating factors of the same cosmic dimension intersecting with the biosphere? To say the least, time is such a vast and important topic in the orientation of human consciousness within the biosphere that we may declare that it is paramount in all human affairs. Indeed the cosmic order, of which the biosphere is the dynamic regulatory mechanism on planet Earth, is itself the expression of time as the medium of universal manifestation. Yet, as Vernadsky perceived in 1944, while we have de- fined space by its own systems of metrics and geometries, by applying these same standards to time we have not defined or known time at all. The cause for this quan- dary seems to lie in the fact that while space is perceptible as a sensory medium-we can see it, touch it, hear through it-and hence, it is evidently measurable, the same is Time and Human Consciousness. 35"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"not the case with time. Time is of the mind, and in this regard, time is inseparable from the issue of consciousness. In fact, you cannot know or experience time with- out becoming conscious. Yet, as we shall see, there is a great confusion when we speak about time, which is actually at the root of the problem of the biosphere, and that is the matter of the clock. In human consciousness, the clock has become so second nature that very few people in industrial society can think of time without immediately associating it somehow with the clock, whether as an instrument or as a metaphor. This, as we shall see, is a major factor causing the general state of consciousness to remain static, especially in relation to the machine, which is continuously increasing in speed, as well as accelerating in the propagation and multiplication of itself. This factor of the clock-in other words, of mechanized time-is also at the root of the confusion concerning the nature of time in much of modern scientific thought. As we shall see, there is a stream of Russian thought after Vernadsky that represents a notable excep- tion to the established view of time in modern thought and science. Suffice it to say that the evolution of modern Western thought and science has been programmed and predisposed to limit its consciousness of time to such a degree that it cannot even perceive of time outside its inherently mechanized perceptions about it. In this obviously also lies the problem of the delimitation of consciousness in the technosphere. \"The deepening crisis of the world outlook is rooted in the permanence of the dominating scientific paradigm,\" writes Russian scientist Maria Maroushkina. \"Un- derlying the materialistic technocratic civilization is the Newtonian-Cartesian para- digm, formed in the Middle Ages, its nucleus being the laws of gravitation and move- ment, as well as the logical principles of proof, laid down by Descartes.\"! This \"per- manent\" stratum of belief, a cultural metaprogram, locks every field of human en- deavor into a conquest by mechanization. It is this metaprogram rooted in the simple unexamined device of the clock, and orchestrated by the equally unexamined effects of an irregular calendar, that keeps human consciousness unchanged and without any real solutions to its problems. As the problems worsen, the confusion of con- sciousness-which is really in a state of crisis-only deepens. To illustrate the current state of confusion regarding time in Western thought, we have the report of the prestigious Seven Pines Symposium on Time held in Stillwater, Minnesota in June, 2001. The New York Times article regarding the Seven Pines Symposium is entitled \"Physics' Big Puzzle Has Big Question: What Is Time?\"2 First of all, the assumption that time is basically a topic of physics in itself is a prob- lem, since time, as we have demonstrated, is actually mental in nature, and if any- 36 . Time and Human Consciousness"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"thing is most visibly manifest in the domain of biology or biogeology. But this head- line is also reflective of the paramount role that physics plays in the Western intel- lectual hierarchy: if physics can't solve it, than what can? Despite the prominence of physics and physicists, the Seven Pines Symposium included historians and philosophers as well. The hope of the symposium was to arrive at a unified theory that encompasses the effects of gravity as described by Einstein's general theory of relativity and the \"fuzziness that occurs in the realm of tiny particles according to quantum physics.\"3 Here we have the problem of time as delimited by the self-imposed spectrum of modern physics. What then could we expect? Certainly no one here had considered the point made by Vernadsky that time is not a function of the metrics of space, which is the realm of physics. So it is not surprising that the symposium ended in a muddle, with the most prominent approach being that time could merely be a \"psychological illusion\" important to humans but not a fundamental part of any unified theory. It is also clear that few, if any, had considered that their views on time might be absolutely conditioned by the mundane and ordinary everyday micro- and macro-organizing factors: the mechani- cal clock and the Gregorian calendar with its second cousin, the Julian count of linear time. From the point of view of the noosphere, of course, this grand Symposium on Time was reflective of very little of the entire human organism, much less of the biosphere itself. The symposium was a representation of the elite intellectual class of the dominant economic, military, and political power of the planet, and hence of the Time and Human Consciousness. 37"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"governing force of the technosphere, the United States of America. But if a realiza- tion that we are a function of the biosphere is critical to our success in launching the noosphere, and the issue of understanding the correct relation of time to the bio- sphere is crucial even to the ability to launch the noosphere, then the Seven Pines Symposium did not even approach the actuality of the current biospheric situation or the nature of time. In this regard it was only a contribution to further the psychoatmospheric density-clouded thought without clarity of purpose-and one more reason why the Inevitable Event was on the biosphere's agenda. If one does not apply certain biospheric yardsticks to the analysis of what is reported as truth, then we will be sunk in a chaotic morass of half-truths that are really obscurations or even lies. The elite American nation, for instance, constitutes only 5 percent of the world's population, yet consumes 40 percent of its natural resources, and therefore has the wealth and power to maintain the military force (allotted a $318 billion budget for 2001-2002) to protect and even further as its right this disproportionate ratio, which is actually a violation of the dynamic balance of the biospheric processes. For this reason, through its official organs of propaganda such as the New York Times, America is able to muster the \"influence\" of whatever occurs within its confines as somehow having more merit than what might be gener- ated in some other nation or country. So a human may read the story in the New York Times on the \"Big Puzzle of Time,\" and most likely they will complacently accept its premise as absolute truth. Yet this social construct of symposium-and-newspaper-story is nothing but an aberrant mental form that obscures the actual nature of time and keeps the mental level at a constant state of \"industrial dull-normal,\" far removed from-or at best, little more than a highly distorted reflection of-the reality of the noosphere. Leaving aside this example of the mental confusion over time, it is necessary to understand from the investigations regarding the biosphere and according to Vernadsky's own judgment, that the biosphere in all its intricate and interlocking processes possesses and is guided by a great order and even a structural dynamic that, being manifestations of the laws of nature, can be given exact mathematical formulation. Why should we not expect that the nature of time in the biosphere should also be characterized by the same orderly quality? In fact, given that the biosphere is actually a life process, like all living matter it too must be governed by timing cycles. Thus the larger order of time that governs the cycles of the biosphere and of the noosphere must also exhibit a grand ordering principle. For if the three dimensions of space govern the domain of the physical world, then the fourth di- mension of time-which governs the life not only of the biosphere but of planets, 38 . Time and Human Consciousness"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"star systems, whole galaxies, and indeed the entire universe-must also consist of a simple, orderly formulation totally apart from the perception of time that governs the stunted consciousness of the technosphere. Such is the Law of Time. THE FOURTH-DIMENSIONAL NATURE OF TIME \"Even though you do not measure the hours of the day as long or short, far or near, you still call it twelve hours. Because the signs of time's coming and going are obvious, people do not doubt it. Although they do not doubt it, they do not understand it. Or when sentient beings doubt what they do not understand, their doubt is not firmly fixed. Because of that, their past doubts do not necessarily coincide with their present doubt. Yet doubt itself is nothing but time. \" -DOGEN, \"THE TIME-BEING\"4 These prescient words of a thirteenth century Japanese Zen master are more true today than they were when he wrote them. Comprehensive studies like the Eranos Yearbook III: Man and Time (1957), which included Carl G. Jung's ground breaking essay on synchronicity, or James T. Frazier's fascinating and monumental Voices of Time (1966), only expand the multidisciplinary breadth of the confusion about time. In the 1970s Frazier helped found the International Society for the Study of Time. The Society is still meeting annually but has yet to reach a definitive agreement on or understanding of the question of time. It is in the context of the enduring confu- sion over time that the Law of Time was discovered. To say that the Law of Time has been \"discovered\" only means that a principle and fundamental law that has always guided the order of the universe has finally been made conscious and articulated in a precise way that is recognizable to the present condition of the human mental na- ture, which is still dominated by the physicalist model. In the whole of modern physics, Minkowski's fourth dimension of time has been misunderstood and treated as if it were a minor dimension, one that is just added on, but not really significant to the level of the three dimensions of space. This is due to the already space-oriented consciousness deriving from certain sets of perceptions established early in the history of civilization and standardized through certain pro- gramming models that are based on the metrics of space and not time, a topic to Time and Human Consciousness. 39"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"which we shall soon turn. It is for this reason that in the formulations of modern physics time is symbolized by a small t that runs in a horizontal line running from left to right at the bottom of any graphing of space with its x and y coordinates. This graphing of small t time gives rise to the notion of the \"arrow of time,\" which is virtually a bedrock dogma of much of modern Western physics. This is the much-touted notion of linear time that supports doctrines of economic inexorabil- ity, material progress, and the like. Of course to anyone versed in the ways of nature, linear time and the arrow of time can be seen as nothing more than artificial con- structs, for the biological nature of time is perceptible at the very least through the great interlocking cycles of nature. Nor is there anything linear about the Earth's rotations around the sun, or of the moon around the Earth, all of which give lie to the physicalist and materially progressivist notion of linear time. Only the technosphere, sustained in its structure by the limited consciousness of time, is driven by this linear principle and for this reason is doomed to run aground on the shoals of its own artificiality. TIME AS THE UNIVERSAL FACTOR OF SYNCHRONIZATION The nature of time is grasped poetically in the form of cycles: \"To every season there is a time. . .\" Biorhythms can even be mapped and the cycles of the biological order of reality can be demonstrated as functions of a chronobiology. But the biological cycles only demonstrate the manifestation of time in the space ofliving matter. If the whole of nature is observed, then one can begin to grasp the masterful orderliness by which every least detail occurs in relation to all the other details in their various cycles-yes, one can grasp in this phenomenal order another deeper aspect of time, and that is time as the universal factor of synchronization. This is the synchronic order of time, the order by which everything in the universe occurs simultaneously in a masterful synchronization from moment to moment in an ever-changing kalei- doscope of infinite varieties of order and harmony. Only historical man deviates from this masterful symphony of time, the synchronic order. Nonetheless, we speak of being \"on time,\" \"in sync,\" \"in tune,\" \"in reso- nance,\" \"in harmony,\" or of being \"tuned-in.\" All of these expressions refer to the attunement of time and the nature of consciousness as awareness in the present moment, in the here and now. This is possible because the same law governs both time and the relation of consciousness to the moment. To answer Vernadsky's ques- tion, \"How can processes which seem purely physical be affected by consciousness?\"- the physical is affected by consciousness, because consciousness is actually a 40 . Time and Human Consciousness"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"function of time. When someone \"discovers\" a law of nature, it is because their consciousness is attuned to the natural process in time, and the law therefore \"re- veals\" itself. But this consciousness can be and most often is of a profoundly unconscious nature. Time is actually the governing principle of a higher self-existing conscious- ness that regulates the order of the universe, both in regard to its living and non- living matter. Because time continuously synchronizes everything into a single coherent whole from the micro to the macro levels, time accounts for the har- mony of the universe. Only man deviates from the universal harmony, and the technosphere, a projection of the human mechanization of time, intrudes upon the intrinsic harmony to the point of its own demise, but man deviates for a purpose. The harmony manifested by time as cosmos-which literally means \"order\" -gives rise to the great and simple formulation of the Law of Time: T(E) = Art; Energy factored by Time equals Art. This means that energy, any manifestation of the physical three-dimensional world, possesses order and is in harmony with its environment because it is factored by time. In the conception of the Law of Time, however, capital T refers to time as the universal factor of synchronization. As the universal factor of synchronization, time is defined by the self-existing and intrinsi- cally perfect mathematical ratio 13:20. Derived from the mathematics of the ancient Maya, this ratio is a universal constant of time that organizes all of the universe as a radial sequence of synchronous moments reflecting different evolutionary phases simultaneously. Because everything perceived is an aspect of instantaneous univer- sal synchronization, time is also the medium of instantaneous information transmis- sion throughout the universe. The noted Russian astrophysicist N. A. Kozyrev (1908-1983), whose work be- gan half a century ago with the theory of the internal structure of stars, later con- ducted a famous series of experiments using telescopes, mirrors, and aluminum, in which he was able to confirm a receipt of information from distant galaxies prior to the time it took the information to arrive via light as a physical medium. In Kozyrev's own words: \"The tests proved the existence of the effects through time of one mate- rial system upon another. This effect does not transmit a pulse (momentum), mean- ing it does not propagate but appears simultaneously in any material system. In this manner, in principle it proves possible to have a momentary relationship and a mo- mentary transmission of information. Time accomplishes a relationship between all phenomena of nature and participates actively in them. . . . Time contains the entire universe of still unexplored phenomena.\"5 The results of these experiments led Kozyrev to various conclusions, among them that time and duration are not the Time and Human Consciousness. 41"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"same thing, and that the velocity of time is instantaneously infinite, formulated as This being so, time must also be the factor or medium that accounts for the experiences of telepathy or other paranormal phenomena. A second, most provoca- tive conclusion derived from his experiments is that time is actually generated as an instantaneous and even simultaneously radial transmission of information from the core of stars, a fact confirmed by the Law of Time's description of the synchronic order of time as being radial in nature. FURTHER EXPANSES OF FOURTH-DIMENSIONAL TIME: THE EVOLUTION OF TIME AS CONSCIOUSNESS Leaving aside for the moment further discussion of Kozyrev's seminal work and its conclusions, at this point let us summarize the two chief qualities of time as defined by the Law of Time: 1) time is the factor of universal synchronization, and 2) time possesses an infinite instantaneity of velocity that is faster than the speed of light, and hence is correlated with telepathy. From these two determining features of the nature of time, two other corollary conclusions may be drawn: 3) the cyclic nature of third-dimensional biological phenomena is a function of the factor of universal syn- chronization which establishes harmonic ratios that determine the different life pro- cesses of different organisms, while 4) the ability of any species or organic whole to maintain its unity with itself and all of its members or parts is an instantaneous func- tion of time as telepathy. To better understand the Law of Time and its radical non-linear definition of time-which is actually the noospheric description of time-we may say that time, being synchronically instantaneous, is both \"vertical\" in relation to space (which is \"horizontal\"), and \"radial\" from the perspective of its own dimension, the fourth. Rather than being the small t line or arrow at the bottom of the physicist's graph, time as the fourth dimension is greater than and inclusive of the third dimension, much as the etheric atmosphere includes and surrounds the physical Earth in a ra- dial \"all-at-onceness.\" To try to measure this phenomenon with the metrics of space and its essentially linear yardsticks is to constrain time into definitions and descrip- tions that are totally alien to its nature. In fact, from the point of view of the dynamics of time, it is space that is the moving line, or rather a set of points in a moving vector that can be described as 42 . Time and Human Consciousness"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"line. Let us extrapolate from the important observation made by Vernadsky at the conclusion to Problems in Biogeochemistry II: if the geometry of time reduces space to a point supplied by an infinitesimal vector, then from the point of view of time, space is an infinitely locatable point. What is this point? It is the point of awareness at which an individual body becomes aware of time. Here, the \"subjective\" description or experience of time cannot be separated from the issue of consciousness. (See plate 3, Model of \"Vertical Time\" in Relation to Horizontal Space.) In the description of time as vertical in relation to horizontal space, this point of awareness of a body in time is defined as the Locus of Consciousness, or L of C. In the flow of moment-to-moment instantaneity that is synchronous with the flow of space, the Locus of Consciousness is that point at which time vector and space per- ception connect. From this defining point of consciousness in the here and now, the flow of space creates a horizontal sensation: one direction flows to the \"past,\" the other to the \"future.\" This is what is normally defined as the sensation of time or the arrow of time. It is actually the definition of the horizontal flow of space in relation to vertical time. What is usually not considered is the vertical dimension of time that connects awareness to space at any given moment, creating sequences of Awareness Units, or AUs. From the defining point of the Locus of Consciousness, there are essentially two spaces and two times: near space and far space, and low time and high time. Near space corresponds to low time and far space corresponds to high time. Near space is essen- tially defined by the perimeter of sense experience, inclusive of the extension of the senses through technological apparatus such as telescopes, microscopes, and the like. This is the domain oflow time. Far space is defined as that space beyond the perim- eter of the sense perceptions, and is characterized by subliminal sensory percep- tions. This is the domain of high time and the atemporality of space. In near space, low time is characterized by what appear to be \"random events.\" The lower the time, the greater the increase of random events. Low time and near space define the qualities of the experience that are properly and purely third-dimensional. High time and far space are purely and properly the domain of the fourth dimension char- acterized by the dominance of the synchronic order of time. The distinction between low time and near space and high time and far space is defined as the threshold of synchronicity. In high time, synchronicity (s) predomi- nates and is greater than random events (re), or (s»(re). In low time, random events predominate and are greater than synchronicity, or (re»(s). Note that the realm of quantum physics occurs in the microrealm of far space. It is this factor that accounts for the \"fuzziness\" of the behavior of subatomic particles, quarks, tachyons, and so Time and Human Consciousness. 4 3"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"forth, which defy the limitations of linear time. These phenomena occur in the subliminal realm of the synchronic order. It is the human mind that is not accus- tomed to behavior in the pure realm of synchronicity that cannot grasp that these particles are moving according to radial laws of fourth-dimensional time, and so appear highly irregular and random to the sense perceptions of the observers that are totally conditioned by third-dimensional space perceptions. Similarly, the high time of the macro threshold of the synchronic order represents the \"other side,\" the \"hereafter,\" the realm of pure vision, which is also governed by strict laws of radial time, and which, to the conditioned experience of a perceiver on this side of the threshold, may appear as something from a distant future or past reality, or even as in a dream. The orderly explication of the Law of Time provides complete math- ematical descriptions and principles that account for the radial order of time, even as it coordinates the near space and low time of random events. In any case, the horizontal line of space in relation to the vertical line of time defining any given Locus of Consciousness describes the macroworld above and the microworld below. As we have noted, the higher threshold of synchronicity above the horizon of space defines the realm of higher consciousness; the lower threshold of synchronicity below the horizon of space defines the realm of quantum physics. Con- necting the macro realm of atemporality and high time, and the lower or micro realm of atemporality and high time, is the vertical time vertice of the ever-present now. At the two far ends of this time vertice of the ever-present now is the Locus of God, the selfsame in each direction. These extreme points of the vertice of time return far space to the Locus of Consciousness through a process of toroidal sub- limation. We are not really dealing with a description of a two-dimensional plane, but a dynamic four-dimensional model held together by a toroidal motion that is continuously returning the farthest space and the highest time, whether from above or below the threshold of synchronicity-\" God\" -to the Locus of Consciousness. Depending on the clarity of mind at any given moment, the vertice of time con- stantly and instantaneously transmits information to the Locus of Consciousness. The discrete units of information thus transmitted are referred to as celestial harmon- ics. A celestial harmonic is described as the index of synchronic incidence defining different levels of co-occurrence. I can be in the present moment sitting in a room, and at the same time, by being fully present in the here and now, I can spontaneously experience any number of telepathic thoughts, memories, feelings of deja vu, and so forth. These experiences are the different levels of co-occurrence that define the index of synchronic incidence and are categorizable as celestial harmonics. The higher the time, the greater the density of celestial harmonics per AU (Awareness Unit). It 4 4 .

It is the mathematics of the Law of Time that provides the \"mapping\" that explains, identifies, and even increases these different harmonic incidences of the synchronic order. Because the vertice of time connects ultimately to the \"Locus of God\" -the mutually defining points that become One at the far ends of the toroidal motion of the vertex of time-this accounts for the existence of the perennial philosophy, the unitive nature of the most revelatory or ecstatic experiences of the great mystics and seers. It is also the relation of awareness in the Locus of Consciousness at any present moment that allows any random event of low time to trigger telepathic ascent into high time depending on the clarity of and duration of the Awareness Unit (AU). From this point of view, the random quality of events in near space is only relative in relation to the absolute nature of the synchronic order, and merely a function of the third-dimensional biological space orientation. For those accustomed to the actual nature of fourth-dimensional time, which includes and controls the third-dimensional order of near space, the random events constituting low time are actually \"signs\" that may be read as message bearing signals of the synchronic order of high time. Brief reflection on this description of vertical time in relation to horizontal space will demonstrate the value of what is referred to as meditation without an object such as that cultivated in the Buddhist traditions, as well as affirm the One Divine Source of the purely monotheistic traditions. Without a clear mind of awareness in the present moment there can be no clear seeing of reality, nor can there be the realization that all of what our senses report to us is constructed in our own mind to conform to what we think is a universe outside of us. At the same time, if we can extend the duration of our awareness in the Locus of Consciousness indefinitely in the vertical direction of time, we come upon the ineffable experience that is an emanation of the Locus of God, however or in whatever \"language\" our senses may later report or define such experiences. Thus we return to the paradox of the definition of space as an infinitely locatable point-this point is none other than our own minds, in which the construct of space is created and dissolved from moment to moment. Such is the subjective description of time from the point of view of the Law of Time, a descrip- tion that begs each one of us to take absolute responsibility for our own experience. But there is an \"objective\" description as well, in which time is also defined as in- separable from consciousness. Implicit in the subjective here-and-now description of the experience of time is the radial matrix of time. At the experiential level it is the now-centered point in the Space-Locus of Consciousness which defines the center of a radial order of time. Time and Human Consciousness. 45"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"46 . Time and Human Consciousness Time radiates out from each here-and-now awareness moment. But the Law of Time also supplies an objective description in which the radial nature of time has two points of determining order: the point of infinite lucidity and cosmogenesis, which is the Locus of God; and the receptive locus of the infinitely locatable point, which is space as constructed by each individual consciousness. Intermediate be- tween the two points-Locus of God and Locus of (individual) Consciousness-is the determining radial matrix of fourth-dimensional time, the universal frequency of synchronization. Mathematically defined as the ratio 13:20 and described by the 13 x 20 matrix of the Harmonic Module, in this mathematical model of fourth-dimensional time we perceive the root of the Law of Time and its basis in the mathematics of the Mayan time science. It is important to understand very clearly that the 13:20 frequency and the mathematical matrix that defines the operations of this frequency of synchroni- zation are the pure mathematics of time totally apart from the metrics and geom- etries of third-dimensional space. This is a point of profound significance to which we shall later return. In the model of objective time, the dynamics of the Law of Time are demon- strated as the evolution of time as consciousness. Here the two unresolved issues of Vernadky's description of the biosphere are unified, the answers to which are the determining factors that allow the triggering of the noosphere: The evolution of time is inseparable from consciousness. Conversely, the evolution of consciousness is inseparable from time. Both time and consciousness are nonphysical fourth- dimensional factors coordinating the third dimension. Because consciousness is synchronized with or by time, it can affect physical third-dimensional processes, in whatever way, whether the acting agent is aware of this or not. Consciousness of the Law of Time, however, is only possible through a profound act of self-reflection. Once it has been made conscious, the discovery of the Law of Time affects the entire medium of planetary consciousness, the noosphere, at first imperceptibly, but then building to a great point of climax coinciding with the climax of the biogeochemical combustion. (See plate 4, The Dynamics of Time: Showing the Evolution of Time as Consciousness.) This dramatic moment of the discovery of the Law of Time is evident in the graphic description of the dynamics of time, showing the evolution of time as con- sciousness. The dynamic of the universal, cosmically intelligent, and intelligible whole-the galactic brain-is depicted as a circle encompassing the evolutionary spec- trum, showing the index of energy-mind progression from the atomic cellular and biological levels to purely mental conditions of being, all of which are functions of"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"the formulation T(E) = Art. From the point of God-Galactic Ordering Dynamic- the circle, or rather, sphere, is divided vertically and horizontally into four quad- rants. The movement of the evolution of time as consciousness travels out of the God center, from right to left, and thence describes, in counterclockwise circular motion, the movement of time as consciousness passing through, or rather defining, the four quadrants, until it returns to the Source again as hyperdimensional time, or \"pure mind.\" The left-hand side describes both the primary prelife, lower left-hand quadrant, and the primary post-life, upper left-hand quadrant. The right-hand side describes the secondary reflex life, the lower right-hand quadrant being the purely third-dimensional life (biosphere), and the upper right-hand quadrant being the evolved fourth-dimensional life (noosphere). The lower half of the sphere beneath the horizontal line running through the God center refers to the Domain of Potentiality, the upper half to the Dominion of Time. The prelife quadrant of the Domain of Potentiality refers to the preconscious quantum dimensional space of pure energy. The lower right-hand quadrant refers to third-dimensional space, the locus of space travel and the realm of the cosmic un- conscious. Within the Dominion of Time, the upper right-hand quadrant refers to the fourth-dimension time, the locus of time travel, and the realm of cosmic consciousness. Finally, the upper left-hand quadrant is the realm of hyperdimen- sional time, or \"pure mind.\" By studying this graphic description, one can grasp the movement of time as consciousness from inorganic preconscious, where duration in time is virtually infinite, to the secondary reflex life, or living organic matter in the third dimension. Here time is unconscious and life builds on the cosmic unconscious as the slowly mutating and evolving biosphere. The cosmic unconscious comes to a climax in the creation of the 12:60 artificial civilization, which is really not true civilization, but rather the technosphere itself. At this point there are moments of consciousness, but only moments. True sustained consciousness is possible only in conditions removed from the technosphere. In the evolution of time as consciousness, the discovery of the Law of Time is a product of the crisis of consciousness unable to sustain itself in the technospheric medium. That is because this medium is a pure function of artificial 12:60 time. Even though the extensions of the senses and the capacity of technology provide the human within the biosphere a holistic perspective of seeing the whole Earth from space, the consciousness is continuously subordinated to the care and maintenance of the machine (or its lifeblood, money), and so cannot remain in a sustained state of heightened awareness or continuing consciousness. Continuing consciousness is only possible with the discovery of the Law of Time, which the crises of the technosphere Time and Human Consciousness. 4 7"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"and of consciousness have themselves brought about. In this regard, the discovery of the Law of Time is the great point of human self-reflection that defines the advance from an exclusive third-dimensional operation and aberrant timing factor to a purely fourth-dimensional and conscious natural timing factor. It is the difference between the cosmic unconscious and cosmic consciousness, the biosphere and the noosphere- in other words, the very topic of this book. DE CHARDIN AND THE PLANETIZATION OF CONSCIOUSNESS The discovery of the Law of Time defines the point between the two stages of the noosphere as described by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin: \"The first stage was the elabo- ration oflower organisms, up to and including man, by the use and irrational combi- nation of elementary sources of energy received or released by the planet. The sec- ond stage is the super-evolution of man, individually and collectively, by the use of refined forms of energy scientifically harnessed and applied in the bosom of the Noosphere, thanks to the coordinated efforts of all men working reflectively and unanimously upon themselves. . . In becoming planetised humanity is acquiring new physical powers that will enable it to super-organize matter. And, even more important, is it not possible that by the direct converging of its members it will be able, as though by resonance, to release psychic powers whose existence is still un- suspected?\"6 The identification of telepathy with the velocity of time emphatically underscores de Chardin's final point. On the other side of the discovery of the Law of Time, civilization, having reached its climax as the technosphere, is replaced by an entirely new noospheric order of human organization defined as PAN: Planet Art Network. This is a structural defi- nition of what Teilhard de Chardin refers to as the \"planetization of consciousness.\" This organization (bionoospheric and not institutional) is \"planet\" because the hu- man organism is self-realized as a planetary organism. It is \"art\" because functioning again in the natural timing frequency, the human is governed by the Law of Time, T(E) = Art, and hence t he reality and the activities o f everyday l ife are defined a s art. And it is a \"network\" because the city, defined by civilization (literally living in cities) and which was a sustaining component of the technosphere, is no longer necessary or viable. Rather, the human becomes redistributed throughout the biosphere-what Teilhard de Chardin refers to as the \"radiation of man \"--connected by a telepathic network that greatly diminishes the reliance on much of the technology that charac- terized the technosphere. Hence Planet Art Network: the replacement of civilization with the fourth-dimensional social organization of the human functioning as the tele- 48 . Time and Human Consciousness"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"pathically coordinating species of the noosphere. In this condition life evolves toward a hyperorganic stage, attaining a state of superconscious activity and self-reflection where time travel replaces the space travel of the phase known as civilization. This evolutionary mode, coinciding with the evolving needs of the local star, conduces at some distant point in the future to the subliminal consciousness and the postorganic postlife that is necessitated by stars as they advance to the stage of super- nova. According to the Law of Time, the nature of consciousness is actually a func- tion of stellar evolution, planets being but harmonic nodes in greater heliospheric fields of resonance. Since time is inseparable from consciousness, this understanding would seem to affirm Kozyrev's hypothesis that time is generated from the stellar core. \"Stars absorb energy from the motion of time,\" declares Kozyrev, \"a star seems to be a time machine.\"7 The Mayan Factor further places the coordinating medium of time as emanating from the core of the galaxy, Hunab Ku, One Giver of Movement and Measure. In the Chilam Balam prophetic tradition, Hunab Ku is also the name given to the final religion of the One God that appears after the religion of the conquistadors has finally passed. Seen from the perspective of the Galactic Brain, the crisis through which we are now passing is but the final stage before consciousness bursts into a new radiance of biosolar-telepathic wonder where negative emotions and thought forms no longer have any place to cling or hide. The Law of Time purposively points to this great end. The whole of the spectrum of the Galactic Brain is mediated by the universal frequency of synchronization, mathematically modeled as the 13:20 matrix, the or- ganizing factor of the synchronic order. The technicalities of this evolutionary spec- trum of the Galactic Brain have been defined in The Dynamics of Time: 260 Postulates (1996) so that the process of the evolution of time as consciousness may be studied and its coming stages prepared for. The mathematical model of this 13 :20 matrix is a description of the fourth-dimensional timing frequency and is both the source of the time vector potentialities and the mathematical tool for mapping the order of synchronicity. Through the discovery of the Law of Time, the 13 :20 matrix is realiz- able through tools that are in accord with its mathematics, and thereby it becomes useful to the everyday consciousness of the human. This too becomes a factor ac- counting for the noosphere's becoming conscious. The fourth-dimensional \"tools\" made accessible through the Law of Time in- clude the Thirteen Moon/2 8- Day calendar, the Dreamspell, and the Telektonon. They will be described more fully in Chapter 8, \"Making the Transition to the New Time.\" With these tools one can begin to construct a map of the time vector potenti- alities contained in the synchronic order as it manifests on a day-to-day basis. Once Time and Human Consciousness. 49"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"the construct is made conscious and correlated to a point in third-dimensional time, then the body in time-the infinitely locatable point that is space-may be coordi- nated by the same common structure of fourth-dimensional time. Following this procedure the individual human consciousness begins to participate in the larger unfolding of the noosphere, and slowly but surely is realized as yet another manifes- tation of the formulation of the Law of Time, T(E) = Art. It is the human being itself that incorporates time, or rather wakes up within itself the order of time. Time is art, while art is actually a function of consciousness expressing itself. THE MAYAN UNDERSTANDING OF THE LAW OF TIME While we will have cause to turn our attention later in this book to the \"how-to\" of fourth-dimensional time, we may consider further the nature and meaning of the mathematics of the Law of Time and their origin with the mysterious civilization of the ancient Maya. The template or matrix of the 13:20 frequency, a 13 x 20 (260) unit structure, was the means for accommodating the base \"calendar\" used by both the ancient and present day Maya: the Tzolkin, or sacred calendar, a set of thirteen numbers and twenty signs that repeat their sequences of permutations every 260 days. While this 13 x 20 matrix accommodates the Tzolkin, it is not confined to being a calendar, as I amply demonstrated in The Mayan Factor. The 13:20 frequency is the universal constant of time from whose mathematics the Tzolkin is derived. Based on the permutation table, called the buk xok in the Chilam Balam tradition, this matrix is a Harmonic Module, a fractal yardstick of radial time with multiple applications, something analogous to the periodic table of elements, but of the synchronic order. It is still a profound challenge to all modern Western scientific thought that the Maya would have possessed such mathematics, apparently inherited from the earlier and even more mysterious Olmec people, and that with this mathematics they would have evolved such a profound perception of time. This was most certainly a factor in the destructive attitude taken toward the Maya by the religious zealotry of the conquer- ors of Mexico. It is also astonishing that the mathematics in which the Harmonic Module is embedded is a vigesimal (20) count, utilizing a zero and a positional order- ing system that accounts for larger or greater values that advance by binary exponentiality rather than a decimal sequentiality. But, quite simply, this system exists in this manner because it is the mathematics appropriate to time. This mathematics is a factor to which any disinterested researcher on the topic of time must now be- come accustomed. 50 .

More appropriately described as synchronization devices or synchronometers, the Maya used at least seventeen of these timing instruments si- multaneously during the great age of their civilization, A.D. 435-830. This fact in itself tells us that the Maya understood time so radically differently from the percep- tion that has evolved in the techno sphere that we must stand in awe that such a knowledge would have developed by a people whose technological development was so minimal, but whose artistic accomplishment was inseparable from their scientific achievement. Time and Human Consciousness. 51"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Yes, the Maya most definitely knew that time is the universal factor of synchro- nization, so their synchronometers must have been for the purpose of attaining a master synchronization with the cosmos. This presupposes such a different state of mind that all the values of the present day must be challenged. The mystery of it is that this mathematics and time science developed in the New World, remote from the saga of civilization in the Old World. The fact that the later Maya practiced ceremonies and blood rituals, the fascination of so many present-day archeologists, should not detract from the understanding that these ceremonial practices stem from a totally different perception of life-and death. Before we judge, we must consider the inescapable truth that nothing in history matches the terror of the different kinds of war and weapons of mass destruction that characterize the fifty-six-year cycle of the technosphere, 1945-2001. Who then is the more barbaric-the Maya, or mod- ern man, \"Homo technosphericus\"? It is the study of this vigesimal mathematics and its 13:20 Harmonic Module that has led to the discovery of the Law of Time. In this regard the Law of Time is a universal law independent of any culture or civilization, even that of the Maya, much like the law of gravity is also a universal law. However, if it had not been for the Maya, who evolved their understanding of the 13 :20 frequency of synchronization to such a high degree, there would never have been a pursuit that led to the discov- 52 . Time and Human Consciousness"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"ery of the law underlying their knowledge of time. If with this law we may categorize the time vector potentialities in six stages of consciousness-preconscious, uncon- scious, and conscious, continuing conscious, superconscious, and subliminal con- scious-then we may be certain that the ancient Maya were also familiar with the time science associated with the higher states of consciousness revealed by the Law of Time. With this time science and mathematics of higher consciousness, the Maya were able to bequeath a prophetic tradition mathematically coded in the Harmonic Module, which, among other matters, led to the discovery or making conscious of the Law of Time itself. Once we appreciate the radically different perception of time and knowledge that is embodied in the Harmonic Module, the mathematical modeling of the 13:20 universal frequency of synchronization, then we may turn to its uses as the fractal radial measure of time applied to many levels of thought and knowledge. For in- stance, using the 13:20 matrix we may turn to an understanding of the Law of Time in human history, as is necessitated by these reflections. With the Mayan time knowl- edge and the placement of their civilization in the New World, we have a gauge and an alternative base of knowledge upon which to evolve a planetary perspective and an objective means of critique of the mainstream development of civilization in the Old World. We may then ask the questions: How did we become what we are now, and how was it that our civilization evolved into the technospheric medium? Time and Human Consciousness. 53"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"THE KEY to The Mayan Factor is the application of the Harmonic Module as a fractal measure that is descriptive of the cycle of thirteen baktuns, the Mayan mea- sure of history. This measure of thirteen baktuns, a cycle extending from 3113 B.C. to A.D. 2012, had been deduced from the stone inscriptions of the Mayan monuments of the Classic period, most of which bear a date within the tenth baktun cycle, A.D. 435-830, or, in the transliterated vigesimal notation of the Mayan Long Count, 9.0.0.0.0-10.0.0.0.0. However, one of the principle discoveries of The Mayan Factor demonstrated that the thirteen baktun cycle was also a function of the Harmonic Module and identical with its mathematical mapping as the 13:20 matrix. There are very profound implications to this correlation of the cycle of history having a one- to-one identity with the 13:20 frequency matrix. For this reason the cycle of history is referred to as a Wave Harmonic of the galactic order of time. Even though history may appear to be a random, haphazard, and checkered advance of humanity from living in small agricultural communities to the present-day technosphere, this pro- cess has actually been an orderly program of the biosphere, the region for the trans- formation of cosmic energy on Earth. The same principle of the analysis of the Law of Time applies here. That is, by analogy, the historical events analyzed from a political or economic perspective rep- resent the perception of the random events of near space and low time, while the analysis of the thirteen baktun cycle Wave Harmonic of history represents the 54 . The Law of Time in Human Affairs"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"perspective of far space and high time. In this Wave Harmonic, the program of history is mathematically defined by 13 baktuns-each baktun consists of 20 katuns- 13 baktuns x 20 katuns = 260 katuns = 13 x 20 matrix of the 13:20 frequency of synchronization. In the 13 x 20 matrix of the Harmonic Module each unit equals one kin, the base unit of fractal measure. By fractal equivalence, in the mapping of his- tory one kin = one katun, one katun = 7,200 days; therefore one baktun = 144,000 (7,200 x 20) days. The mathematical perfection of the cycle of history matching the 260-unit model of the harmonic matrix means that history is a factor of syn- chronization of the higher order of time coordinating the human organism within the biosphere. By means of the thirteen baktun Wave Harmonic of history, the incidence of human Civilizational Advance (CA) may be plotted in a very precise way as a progression going from a very dispersed and scattered state to the point of attaining its exponen- tial climax in the final saga of geochemical combustion, the fifty-six-year cycle of the technosphere. In this regard we must ask: What do we mean by \"history\" from the Wave Harmonic point of view? As an organism that is a function of the biosphere, history defines that stage when that organism, humankind, enters a process of altering its biomes through increasingly artificial means or extensions of itself that exhibit a compulsive reordering of society into denser and denser clusters of habitations known as cities, hence civilization, \"city-life.\" In the stage before history, the human had created certain tools and had begun experiments in agriculture and horticulture, but the mental order remained in an aboriginal condition. Unconsciously absorbed as an integral mechanism within the cycles of the biosphere, the human wrapped his understanding of these cycles and of his place in them in the garb of myth and ritual. But with history, something differ- ent occurs. The artificial means or extensions of the senses are ordered by a different form of mentality. Those projections of thought and consciousness, though immate- rial, affect the material surroundings, and take on an aggressive dynamic. The ag- gregate effects of these artificial extensions are maintained by a new mental dynamic that is contained and then conditioned by a new kind of macro-organizing thought structure, independent of the actual cycles of the biosphere. What is this new men- tality? How can we most precisely define it? Here are some points to ponder. The Mayan reckoning of the beginning of history is precisely dated to August 13, 3113 B.C., Long Count 13.0.0.0.0. The Hindu reckoning of the beginning of the Kali Yuga is dated to February 19, 3102 B.C. These dates are only eleven years apart. What cosmic event occurred at that time to initiate the Wave Harmonic of history? As we have seen, there is a perfect identity of the The Law of Time in Human Affairs. 55"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Wave Harmonic of history, as a fractal equivalence, with the Harmonic Module, itself a description of the universal 13:20 frequency of synchronization. This being so, both the calculation of the beginning of history as well as the duration of its entire cycle are functions of the Law of Time. This means that something within the Earth's noosphere occurred that triggered the Wave Harmonic, itself a manifesta- tion of the Law of Time. Also, by most judgments and standards, history began at a very precise place as well-Sumeria, in the Mesopotamian basin of what is now called the Middle East. Why? And what relation is there between the precise event that triggered the Wave Harmonic of history and Sumeria, the site of the first city, Uruk? What event could have established a macro-organizing principle to propel the dy- namic of human thought and technology into the trajectory concluded by the technosphere? THE ORIGINS OF THE 12:60 FREQUENCY In the recently published book The History of the World-A 6,000 Year Chronicle of Time, we find the point that establishes the definite artificiality of a new kind of macro-organizing principle, driving humankind toward the Inevitable Event; here we find the genesis of artificial time: \"Ca. 3000 B.C. Sumerians divide day into 24 hours, 60 minutes, 60 seconds and circle into 360 degrees.\"! While this is a fact we may take for granted because it is the basis of mechanized time in the form of the clock, for precisely that reason it should give us pause. For one thing, this means that the measuring system of the clock was already established at the beginning of his- tory, some 4,500 years before the clock as we know it was actually invented! This is quite an astonishing fact. It means that mechanization was implicit in the first intel- lectual act of history. Why or how would it have occurred at the precise point of the beginning of history in Sumeria? The Law of Time defines this mechanistic organizing principle as the basis of the 12:60 artificial timing frequency (irregular twelve-month calendar combined with mechanical sixty-minute hour). Therefore, it was at this point at the beginning of history that artificial time and its progeny, mechanization, were actually registered as a thought form and thus became embedded in the as-yet-unconscious noosphere. Or, was it already embedded in the noosphere to be triggered at this precise point- and if so, why and how? The point is that history, as it has evolved as the mainstream of civilization from Sumeria to the World Trade Center, has always been driven by the organizing principle of artificial time. It is artificial time that separates history from prehistory-and, as we shall see, from post-history as well.

In the higher knowledge of the Mayan understanding, it provided the perfect measure of the cycle of artificial time. From the perspective of the actual noospheric timing, which operates according to the natural 13 :20 cosmic timing frequency, history is none other than a manifestation of artificial time. Civi- lization becomes organized by the principle of artificial time. But because it is artifi- cial, it cannot endure. If the mathematical basis of mechanized time, and hence of mechanization, was already established at the beginning of history, then the end of history is the end of artificial, mechanized 12:60 time.

What is important to grasp is that the entire cycle of artificial time was already perceived by the Mayans as a phenomenon that could not endure more than the length of the cycle of thirteen baktuns. It is necessary for the reader to understand how this perspective was discovered. It was the result of a phenomenological experiment of living according to the synchronic cycles of the Mayan time science. After the death of my son in 1987, my wife and I began in earnest to follow the cycles encoded in the Mayan calendar: 13- day, 20-day, 52-day and 260-day cycles. Our life changed dramatically. At the same time, I endeavored to define the mathematical basis of these cycles. Once I resigned my academic position in early 1989, we were swept by a wave of time that took us from the Rocky Mountains to Southern California to the Hawaiian Islands in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. There, in relative isolation from the rest of the world, we plunged into our experiment. Before we had truly settled in, the time wave took us to Switzerland, where on December 10, 1989, in the Museum of Time in Geneva, we were able to put our phenomenological experiment to the test-although we did not consciously realize at the time that we were doing so. There in the Museum of Time, essentially surrounded by examples of the his- tory of the clock and mechanization, and because our perceptions had been altered by our living so completely by the various timing cycles encoded in the Mayan cal- endar system, we were able to spontaneously perceive the existence of two timing frequencies. The natural frequency-the one we had been living-we understood instinctively to be the 13:20 timing frequency. The other frequency-the one en- shrined in this Museum of Time-we understood to be the artificial 12:60 timing frequency. This realization of artificial time was rooted in the evident proof that the clock is based on the twelve-part division of a flat circle, a spatial plane that clearly has nothing to do with the dynamics of time. It is a manifest error, but one that humanity has taken for granted and endowed with all of the characteristics of \"truth.\" We also immediately saw that the error of mistaking the division of a two- dimensional plane in space for a measure of time was transmitted not only through the clock, but through the twelve-month Gregorian calendar as well. With brief reflection upon what a gross error this was-substituting a twelve-part division of space as a measure of time, and then elevating this mistake as the truth of the mea- sure of time-we understood how it could have actually led humanity away from the natural time of the universe. In making this observation, we immediately and intu- itively grasped the necessary solution: replace the erroneously measured twelve-month Gregorian calendar with the perfect measure of the Thirteen Moon/2 8- Day calendar.

It was now also clear why the Mayan time science was so superior. It was based on the reality of time as a factor of synchronization. By contrast, the concept of time as it had developed in the main- stream of civilization was limited, linear, and totally third-dimensional, a fact that confirmed Vernadsky's analysis, as well, that our notions of time are a function of the metrics of space.

The complete structure of the mathematical codes of time, as well as the psychomythic description of the causes and effects of the error in time, is known as the Dreamspell, which is defined as follows: \"DreamspeH: function of fifth-dimensional galactic-solar planetary regulation; 26,000-year renewable cycle and planetary castle genesis; any consensus reality; in disregard of interdimensional reality creates entropic spell of history; cure for loss of galactic memory.\"2 The planetary castle genesis refers to the five castles of time (each 5,200 years in length), divided into three geneses-the Dragon, the Monkey, and the Moon-that constitute the entire fractal panorama of the 26,000-year cycle of his- tory that ends in 2012, and is meant to be renewed in 2013 (an obvious synchronic reference to the 13:20 timing frequency). In the Dreamspell analysis, the beginning of history occurs almost 5,200 years ago between the Monkey and the Moon gen- eses, and is marked by the imposition of the false 12:60 timing ratio. In light of this analysis and definition it is worth quoting certain passages from the Dreamspell text that describe this precise moment at the beginning of history and that the Law of Time defines as the root error of civilization. First we quote from the \"Dreamspell Genesis,\" and then from the descriptions of the \"Dreamspell Journey and Mission of Timeship Earth 2013.\" The purpose of quoting these pas- sages here is to establish a psychomythic context to explain the profound nature of what we refer to as the error in time compounded over 5,000 years of history: Imposters, male priests and warriors usurped the power of the thirteen moons. They hid the thirteen among themselves and attempted to banish all memory of the matrix dreamspell of magic. . . The planetary kin had imposed upon them the diminishing power ratio of 12:60. No longer the magic of thirteen moons but a twelve month calendar of uncertain meaning. No longer the timeless gyre of magical flight, but a sixty-minute hour to earn one's bread. Time was compressed into a flat circle. . . The 13:20 ratio is the base operating ratio of timeship Earth. . . In that vital moment during the magic flight. . . Toward the moon genesis, another spell was cast. Instead of the 13:260 ratio already stored deep within the crystal core of timeship Earth, the planetary kin received the 12:60 ratio, the dark dreamspell of history. . .

It takes twelve years for Jupiter to orbit once around the sun. It takes sixty years for Jupiter and Saturn to be conjunct. Twelve times five equals sixty, one sixth of the flat three hundred sixty degree circle. The difference between twelve and five is seven. While the priests of the calendar of ancient Babylon banished the power of the thirteen moons, they replaced that power with the power of seven. While the twelve diminished the power of thirteen by one, the sixty raised the power of twenty by three. A seeming increase in power occurred, but an increase only on the flat plane of the third-dimensional time to which the planetary kin were now consigned. With the banishment of the thirteen moons, the fourth-dimensional time magic. . . became the property of the priest class. Setting up religions and governments to maintain the kin within the third dimension, the priests were assured that anyone having fourth-dimensional experiences either be appropriated or destroyed.J So much for the psychomythic impression of the genesis of artificial time, the flat time of an exclusive third-dimensional reality called history. A few further quo- tations from the Dreamspell emphasize both the interplanetary and mathematical root of false time: At -3187 Dreamspell years the time bandits on the sixth and seventh orbits pulsed their beam. The 12:60 frequency of the memory virus took immediate effect on the third-dimensional space suits. . . The Dreamspell of history was cast. Imposter priests on Earth substitute the 12:60 ratio. . . Instead of the magic of following thirteen moons, a non-circulating twelve-month calendar is substituted; instead of the beauty and power of magical flight, the sixty-minute hour. The result is disastrous. The twelve-month calendar is the consequence of the 12:60 ratio imposed at -3187 Dreamspell years (3113 B.C., Julian/Gregorian). With no basis in or capacity for measuring galactic time, the twelve-month calendar is actually a third-dimensional prison keeping the four root races separate and at war with each other.4 These descriptive explanations of the error in time define such a profoundly radical point of view that we must flesh out the implications and description of the 62 . The Law of Time in Human Affairs"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"course of artificial time according to the analysis of the Law of Time. From the outset of civilization in Sumeria, artificial time captures the human mentality in the order oflow time and near space (third dimension), separating it from high time and far space (fourth dimension). The registration of artificial time within the uncon- scious structure of the noosphere, which is intrinsically governed by the universal 13:20 frequency of synchronization, creates a conflict and a pressure in the noosphere, a time warp or taint that affects the entire biosphere. Civilization-living in cities-increasingly becomes the human norm within the biosphere. Where there had been no civilization, at a few key places around the planet civilization now arises-a process that goes from the crystalline structures at the origin to the later phases of imperialism and empire building. This cycle is re- peated again and again. Even in the New World where the 13:20 natural timing frequency prevailed, the later stages of civilization succumbed to the effects of the 12:60 already seeded in the noosphere. Ultimately, all humanity and the biosphere were to be governed by the artificial timing frequency that ends with the construc- tion of the technosphere, the final and supreme expression of artificial time. Indeed, the technosphere is the absolute conclusion of what can rightly be called an artificial time warp in the biosphere. Concerning the mathematical basis of the 12:60 frequency, V. A. Ponko of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Novosibirsk, has conducted extensive research and wave analysis on the mathematical properties of the cycles of history. He has con- cluded that as a mental coordinate, the number 12 is a strict construct of the angles of space. Since it does not correspond to the sinusoidal curvature of the cycles of time and the plotting of all organic phenomena, when used as a time factor the number 12 offers no \"protection\" from bombardment by any number of cosmic forces. The mathematical plotting of the 13:28 frequency that characterizes the Thirteen Moon calendar, on the other hand, is in alignment with the sinusoidal curve properties of organic phenomena, and therefore functions as an \"umbrella\" maintaining the organism in resonance with the biosphere.s Here let us make a more precise definition of timing frequencies and the nature of calendars as the macro-organizing programming systems of the human in the biosphere. By defining time as the universal frequency of synchronization, we are saying that synchronization is the fundamental program to which everything ad- heres and which makes everything perceptibly coherent, hence synchronic order. Therefore, the natural timing frequency that is a universal phenomenon both regu- lates the phenomenal order of the cosmos, and in the human is absorbed as a mental frequency that unconsciously synchronizes the mind and senses with the natural The Law of Time in Human Affairs . 6 3"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"order. The result is the normal sensation and experience of the harmony of reality. This defines both a fundamentally prehistoric perception of reality as well as the spiritual experience that is common when we are confronted with the awesomeness of nature-usually far away, it should be noted, from city life. This universal factor of synchronization we have identified as the mathematically precise ratio 13:20, a ratio constant embedded in the structure and order of the calendrical and astro- nomical system of the ancient Maya. If we understand that this frequency of synchronization is a genuinely universal constant, then we may comprehend how not only the entire biosphere, but solar system and galaxy are also governed by the same frequency. This is how the Kozyrev experiments could show that there is instantaneous transmission of information throughout the universe, which in its entirety is a function of the formulation velocity of time is instantaneously infinite. Synchronization and infinite instantaneity of trans- mission are mutually defining-everything is always instantaneously synchronized. We can further say that synchronization \"syntropizes\" while dissynchronization \"entropizes.\" There is no lag time in synchronization. This being the case, we can then begin to understand how the acceptance and institutionalization of the artificial 24-hour, 60-minute, 60-second division of the 360 degree circle as the basis for defining time could be such a singular and ulti- mately disastrous deviation from the universal frequency of synchronization. Thus when we speak of the artificial 12:60 timing frequency, we are referring to the men- tal effect of the feedback program of the use of artificial and erroneous instruments of measure. Rather than allowing the mind to remain in the natural harmony of synchronization with nature, the artificial 12:60 standard and its instruments estab- lish a feedback effect in the mind that accustoms it to the deviation from nature. This habituation results in the creation of an unconscious timing frequency that is accepted by the consensus reality as the actual norm. Separation of human order from the biosphere becomes accepted and acceptable, making civilization not only possible, but setting it up, as it were, as a parallel rival to \"nature.\" In fact, it is the unconscious mental frequency of 12:60 artificial time that coordinates and main- tains civilization as a belief system. When we speak of the instruments of measure of artificial time, we are specifi- cally referring to the Gregorian calendar as the macro-organizing principle and the watch or mechanical clock as the micro-organizing principle. The macro-organizing principle organizes our life into days, weeks, months, and years. The micro-organizing principle organizes our life into seconds, minutes, and hours. These two instru- ments have their common root in the error in time that occurred 5,000 years ago at 64 . TheLawof TimeinHuman Affairs"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"the beginning of history. Try to think of life without these instruments and you will quickly realize how second nature they are-and yet there was a time when such instruments and their terminology did not exist. Before turning our attention to an analysis of these two instruments and their effects on human consciousness, we must view the entire cycle of the Wave Harmonic of history as a function of the macro- organizing principles of time that the human in the biosphere adopted for its uses and that, in turn, condition at a most profound level the worldview of the culture or civilization that uses it. HISTORICAL CALENDARS AS INSTRUMENTS OF ASTRONOMICAL MEASURE It may be rightly asked, What does a calendar measure? At a minimum, a calendar is or should be the measure of the Earth in its rotation around its local star, the sun. This rotation takes 365 days. The Earth's satellite, the moon, is the obvious synchronizing factor between the Earth and the sun. But here we encounter a difficulty. The moon can be measured by various cycles. The synodical cycle, from new moon to new moon, is 29.5 days. The sidereal cycle, the measure taken from where the moon appears at the same place in the sky, is just over 27 days. There is an apsidal cycle, however, taken from the measure of when the moon's axis is tilted farthest from the Earth, which is 28 days. This variance of measures is due to the fact that until the rise of rocketry, we could not really see the moon from space. In actuality the moon rotates around the Earth thirteen times during the time it takes the Earth to orbit the sun once. If one were objectively seeking the proper measure of the Earth's orbit using the moon as the measuring device, we would therefore construct an instrument for time reckoning that consists of an even harmonic measure of thirteen cycles of twenty- eight days each. The 28-day cycle conforms, of course, to the female menstruation cycle, an obvious human biological cycle, and it also divides perfectly into four 7 -day subcycles or weeks. Also, 13 x 28 = 364, the same number of days as thirteen moons multiplied by four 7 -day weeks (a total of fifty-two weeks), with the 365th day being a free day, or Day Out of Time, no day of the week or month at all. We shall deal with the perceived extra quarter-day later in our discussion. The point is this: If time is a factor of synchronization, then a calendar-as an instrument for measuring the count of time-should also be constructed so that it maximizes the factor of synchronization. This can only be done if the instrument of time reckoning is constructed on harmonic principles in conformity with the objec- tive data of nature. Such an instrument would also conform to the orderly processes The Law of Time in Human Affairs. 6 5"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"of the biosphere taken as a whole, and be a great assistance in bringing into con- sciousness the cosmic programs that organize the biosphere and noosphere. The Thirteen Moon/28-Day calendar is the perfect instrument for such a simple regis- tration of harmony and synchronization. It should also be noted that in its math- ematics the Thirteen Moon/28-Day calendar is a function of the 13:20 timing fre- quency. This in itself establishes the Thirteen Moon/28-Day calendar as a perfect instrument of the Law of Time and as a function of the synchronic order of reality. Since the process of civilization represents a break from a long cycle generally undistinguished by the kind of perturbations that characterize history, the analysis of the Law of Time assumes that in prehistory humans lived in relative harmony, and therefore that the humans tended to use harmonic instruments of time reckon- ing. The humans living in greater harmony with the biospheric cycles would be disposed to be in greater unconscious or aboriginal attunement with the noosphere. Since the noosphere is regulated by the synchronic order of the universal 13:20 timing frequency, the humans would be more naturally disposed to devise, adopt, or intuitively utilize the time measure in greatest accord with this instinctual 13:20 noospheric timing ratio. This instrument of time measure would, of course, be the Thirteen Moon/2 8-Day calendar. It should also be noted that this calendar is a perfect solar-lunar measure; that is, it uses the even, regular lunar cycle of28 days as the standard of measuring the 365-day solar cycle of the Earth. The balance of solar and lunar may also be taken as"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"symbolic of human psychological characteristics and their balance or imbalance. A solar-lunar calendar will represent and reflect a balance of the solar-lunar, masculine and feminine qualities within the human being. It is important to bear in mind these considerations of calendars and their effect on shaping the human historical conscious- ness and its psychological makeup. From this perspective, history is, in fact, a process of falling away from the perfection of harmonic standards. Evidence exists that the Thirteen Moon/28-Day measure was widely known in prehistory. We find evidence of its use as a prehistoric synchronic measure in the remote past of China, in Polynesia, and scattered across late neolithic Europe and the Middle East. Among the Maya it was known as the Tun Uc, literally \"moon count\" or count of seven, while the living tradition of the Thirteen Moon/28-Day calendar is still continued in South America and in the British Isles, where it is known as the Druid Tree calendar. While the Druid calendar has no year count attached to it that would definitively testify to its prehistoric ancestry, the South American cal- endar does. Known as the Pachacuti, the South American Thirteen Moon/28-Day calendar is currently in the year 5509, which places its origins at 3308 B.C., toward the middle of the fourth millennium before Christ, and several hundred years before the beginning of the thirteen baktun Wave Harmonic of history. If we understand that calendars are genuine time-measuring devices meant to synchronize us with the cosmic order within the biosphere, and that calendars are thereby programming devices, we may then say that a calendar of perfect harmony can have no history. In other words, by its harmony such a calendar is always in tune with the cosmos, which is beyond history. History can only be a function of a dishar- monic programming, not in sync or even at odds with the laws of natural time. From the point of view of timing devices, there are two factors in the establish- ment of history. The first is the 12:60 program established 5,000 years ago with the division of the day into 24 hours, 60 minutes, 60 seconds, based on the 360-degree division of the circle. The other factor is the use of a purely lunar calendar that is difficult to reconcile with the actual measure of the solar year. The purpose of the 12:60 measure was to establish a timing standard that was actually a pseudosolar calendar to assert male intellectual dominance. The Babylonian (and later, Egyp- tian) calendar consisted of twelve 30-day cycles = 360 days = 360 degrees, plus an extra 5-day cycle. The 30-day measure is not actually a natural one, being a half day more than the synodic lunar measure, but one that conforms to the hexagisimal (6-based) mathematics of the circle. For this reason, this instrument of time reckon- ing is defined as pseudosolar. Its ultimate descendent, as we shall see, is the twelve- month Julian/Gregorian system. The Law of Time in Human Affairs. 6 7"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"By contrast, the Maya also had a 365-day solar calendar, the Haab. Its measure, however, is that of eighteen 20-day cycles (18 x 20 = 360) plus the 5-day cycle (uayeb), the 20-day cycle (vinal) being a mathematical function of the 13 :20 frequency. In addi- tion, the Maya had the measure of the tun, the 360-day count of which is precisely the same as that of the degrees of the circle. It was the tun that the Maya used to measure the thirteen baktun count, which actually consists of5,200 tun (5,125 solar years). The purpose of this measure was to provide an exact harmonic standard for the measure of history that, we may recall, is the duration of artificial time. It is very relevant that the harmonic standard of the thirteen baktun Wave Harmonic of history is the 360-day tun, the actual temporal equivalent of the degrees of a circle in space. The precise measurement of the cycle of artificial time, which turned out to be anything but har- monic, could yet be measured with a harmonic unit that reflects both the circle and the mathematical perfection of the Law of Time. How better to coordinate the entire cycle of artificial time than by the tun, a unit of measure that reflects the 360-degree circle, the basis of the original error in artificial time? As we will later observe, the fact that the Law of Time coordinates even the cycles of artificial time is also evident in the analysis of the timing of the fatal flaw of the Twin Towers apocalypse. While the Babylonians began to apply a hexagisimal time-reckoning device based on spatial metrics of the circle, another factor became predominant in the Old World: the rise of the synodical lunar calendar as the exclusive measure of time. The synodi- callunar calendar is purely lunar in that it is not evidently or perfectly harmonized with the 365-day measure of the solar cycle-a fact of great consequence for the development of mainstream civilization. The Babylonian calendar, with its abroga- tion of the thirteen perfect 28-day months, established the pseudosolar twelve-month measure. This twelve-month measure conformed to the lunar measure of twelve synodic lunations per lunar year. However, twelve lunations are only 354 days, eleven days short of the solar year. This required an intricate set of calculations to make the lunar calendar keep up with the measure of the Earth's solar orbit. And in reality, although we tend to think of the moon as feminine, the knowledge of the synodic measure, the cycle from new moon to new moon, became the exclusive province of a male priest class that used the lunar calendars to capture and control the feminine principle, and to oppress women in general. Whereas the Babylonian and Egyptian solar calendars fell into disuse over time, the lunar calendar persisted. Since there is only one moon orbiting Earth, it should be kept in mind that all lunar calendars are essentially the same. One and the same moon in all its phases is apparent to all humans on Earth. So when we speak of different lunar calendars- most notably the Hebrew, the Islamic, and the Chinese-the measure is basically the 68 . The Law of Time in Human Affairs"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"same, from new moon to new moon, but New Year's Day falls differently in each of them, thus accounting in part for the various calendrical traditions. Within each of these lunar calendars, a different set of holidays is programmed. It is the program- ming of the different holidays and festivals of the calendars, along with the dating of their new year, that makes each lunar calendar tradition distinct and that also dem- onstrates how a calendar is a programming device. For instance, if one were to take out the different holidays programmed into the Hebrew lunar calendar, there really would be no such thing as Judaism. This demonstrates that the cultural conditioning of a people is totally dependent on the programming of the calendar they use. This also shows how a calendar is a feedback mechanism that maintains a group of people within the confines of its own self-established belief system. Of the three lunar calendars we have mentioned, the oldest count of years is accorded to the Hebrew calendar. This year Rosh Hashanah, or Jewish New Year, occurred on the new moon, September 17, 2001, and marked the beginning of year 5762. This places the origin date for the Hebrew calendar in the year 3761 B.C., some 453 years prior to the commencement of the Pachacuti count. The Hebrew calendar (like the Chinese calendar, which we will discuss below) makes up for the slippage of eleven days per solar year by intercalating a thirteenth lunation cycle approximately every three years, or exactly seven such thirteenth moons every nine- teen years. These numbers too-13, 7, and 19-are key harmonic factors of the synchronic order of time. This demonstrates that, at the very least, the synodical lunation calendars are calibrated in their larger cycles by the Law of Time. But the effect of being a purely lunar measure, at variance with the actual 365 -day measure of the solar year, creates an interesting and one-sided approach. There is no question that the lunar calendar civilizations are the tool of powerfully patriarchal societies, the tables of the moons and the years being the possession of a dominant male priest class. The Chinese lunar calendar differs from the Hebrew in one important distinc- tion: from the most ancient times it has been embedded in a system known as the five elements, and is coordinated with a very elaborate mathematical system that bears some resemblance to the 60-60, 24-360 basis of the SumerianiBabylonian 12:60 frequency. This synchronizing system accounts for the Chinese cycles of years that are counted by the twelve zodiacal animals in combination with the five elements: earth, fire, wood, water, and metal, thus giving rise to 60 (12 x 5) year cycles. Three of these sixty-year cycles create a \"group\" or cycle of 180 years. We are now (in 2001) in the eighteenth year of the twenty-seventh group, or year 4,698 of the Chinese lunar calendar. So embedded is Chinese culture and civilization in this calendar, with its elaborate system, that to take away this calendar would virtually eliminate The Law of Time in Human Affairs. 6 9"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Chinese culture altogether. Perhaps more than any other factor, this highly involved calendar also accounts for the longevity and tenacity of Chinese civilization as one continuous tradition for the duration of its history, which according to the reckon- ing of its calendar began in 2697 B.C., a date, interestingly enough, that coincides with the dedication of the Great Pyramid of Egypt. Despite its marvelous system, the Chinese lunar calendar is still just that: a lunar calendar. The problem with this, from the point of view of the Law of Time, is that when it is not regulated by a proper solar count or measure, the lunar calendar leads people into one-sided developments of one kind or another, if only to the extent to which these calendars foster such profoundly patriarchal societies, of which the Chi- nese is certainly no exception. The influence and use of the Chinese lunar calendar system extends into southeast Asia, Tibet, Mongolia, Korea, and Japan. As a field of thought within the noosphere, the Chinese system is the equal in power base to the Babylonian and Indian systems, at least up to the time of the dominance of the Gregorian. Even today, the Chinese New Year exerts a powerful attraction worldwide. While the Chinese and Hebrew lunar calendar systems maintain a powerful con- servative strain of human society, the intercalation of the thirteenth moon, seven times every nineteen years, creates a kind of circulation within the system. Thirteen is the number of circulation, whereas twelve is that of a static, non-circulating spatial order. The taboo on the number thirteen-epitomized by the superstition about Friday the thirteenth-must certainly be related to the suppression of the solar- lunar Thirteen Moon/28-Day calendars in virtually all historical societies. This ir- rational repulsion of the number 13 serves psychologically in defense of the \"ratio- nality\" of the number 12, a number that does not circulate time and is at the root of the linear conception of time. The illogical and irrational decisions that are made and then institutionalized into the human social fabric must at one point be dis- counted. Any illusion or error pursued for too long will always end in disaster. The Islamic lunar calendar, used by some 1.3 billion humans, is distinguished by two factors: It is based on a known historical incident, the Hegira or flight of the prophet Muhammad from Mecca to Medina, dated to the new moon or Muharram 1, Julian, July 16, 622 (Gregorian, July 26). It is a pure twelve-month lunar calendar running on a cycle of pure lunar years of 354 days, with no intercalary lunations, and in this regard does not annually harmonize with the 365-day solar cycle. 70 .

But if we are to count the solar years since the Hegira, correlated to Gregorian July 26, then it is solar year A.H. 1379. We see here a discrepancy of some some forty-three years between the solar count and the lunar count. The lunar count continuously retrocedes so that it takes thirty-two years for one Muharram to occur at the same place in the cycle of the solar year. In essence, the Islamic lunar calendar creates a hermetic, retrocessing time bubble with no circulation of the power of the thirteenth moon, and that accounts for the highly conservative and patriarchal nature of much oflslamic society. Again, while there may be a virtue to maintaining a strict lunar calendar count, if it is not correlated to a harmonic solar or solar-lunar standard, the effects will be precisely of the nature that we see occurring in today's world, a point to which we shall later return. Finally, in this brief consideration of calendars as the principle macro-organizing system for the programming of human society, a word should be said about the system of calendars in the predominant part of the Indian subcontinent. Long be- fore they adopted the Babylonian solar zodiac and hexagisimal spatial principles for reckoning time, the Hindus also had a type of 28-day count, but one based on the course of the moon in relation to a set of stars called Nakhsastras; this created a kind of 2 8-part lunar zodiac. In this system, however, the Hindus divided the 360-degree lunar ecliptic into twenty-seven equal parts (27 days = sidereal cycle of the moon) each part equal to 13 degrees, 20 minutes of are, the precise measure of the 13:20 timing frequency. A complex variety of lunar calendars were developed early on, but were gradually displaced by what we call the pseudosolar Babylonian division of the Earth's ecliptic into twelve 30-degree segments, a fact that reflects the adoption to the unconscious 12 :60 frequency program. The Hindu (pseudo) solar calendars are all based on the same division into 30- degree arcs-a circle or plane in space! While the base count of the present era is taken from February 18,3102, the beginning of the Kali Yuga-the last and darkest age-exactly 5,104 years ago (dated from Gregorian year 2002), today there are at least six different calendars in use throughout the subcontintent, each essentially the same as the other, but characterized by different dynastic starting points. These dif- fering counts, coupled with the distinct profusion of religious holidays, accounts for the jarringly conservative and colorful confusion that characterizes present-day Indian society-a neo-Babylonian time warp, its populace locked into place by com- plex systems of pseudo-solar calendars set in the context of earlier Hindu astronomi- cal cycles of a vast and overwhelmingly cosmic nature.

While we can generally see how the Babylonian and lunar calendar systems shaped the mainstream civilizational orders of the Old World, in our time map we must also take into account the workings of the 12:60 artificial timing frequency within the unconscious noosphere. In this sense, the 12:60 fre- quency refers to the principle programs of control adopted and maintained through use of the twelve-month calendar systems in the Old World. (See plate 5, Noospheric Time Map-Wave Harmonic of History.) Plotting the incidence of these calendrical streams on the time map, we must keep in mind that the calendar systems are the chief instruments for establishing and maintaining the human mind and social order within very specific programs of be- havior. These programs, at least in the Old World, were characterized by the intro- duction of artificial systems of exchange called money, and accompanying programs of taxation. These systems were adopted to a greater or lesser degree by all the Old World societies. In this we find the root of the slogan, \"time is money,\" where money is the artificial medium to negotiate artificial time. The end of history is the end of money and the end of artificial time. The word \"calendar\" itself is derived from a Latin word meaning \"account book,\" the first day of every month being calends or the date of payment of debts. Now, let us return to a consideration of the two principal and resultant 12:60 instruments dominating the end of historical time: the Gregorian calendar and the mechanical clock. We may note that toward the conclusion of the twelfth baktun cycle (A.D. 1618), the clock reaches its perfection at the very moment of the imple- mentation of the Gregorian calendar reform (A.D. 1582), just after the act of global circumnavigation had been accomplished. Within the entire thirteenth baktun cycle, 1618-2012, the coincidence of these three factors-clock, calendar, and European global circumnavigation-induced what amounts to a 12:60 frequency capture of planetary time in the biosphere. What are the implications of this takeover of time by an irregular and irrationally measured Gregorian calendar and its accompanying micro-organizing device, the mechanical clock? Plotting the growth curves of human population, machine, and money, we see that the complete infusion of the 12:60 artificial timing frequency creates an unprec- edented acceleration, the exponential peak of which occurs at the moment of the Inevitable Event.

The Law of Time in Human Affairs"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"comprehend even more deeply the nature of calendars and their effect, especially with regard to the current global standard. Because the calendar is a macro-organizing principle, when accepted over time it establishes in the mind, individually and collectively, a set of perceptions that are automatically taken for granted as being \"real\" and \"indisputable.\" These sets of perceptions define the paradigm by which a people, culture, or even an entire civili- zation operates. The Gregorian calendar, the current global civil standard, is the paradigmatic macro-organizing principle in which are embedded all the laws, cus- toms, institutions, and scientific principles governing the present global civilization- not to mention all the holidays of the Vatican-ordained Catholic Church. According to the Law of Time, the current calendar is an irregular standard of measure; its units of measure do not correspond. This calendar represents, therefore, the institu- tionalization of disorder and entropy. Because it has existed for a sufficiently long duration in the human historical cycle-2,OOO years, including its predecessor, the Julian calendar-the perceptions fostered by the unconscious acceptance of the Gregorian calendar are taken as the unshakable bedrock of nature and reality.

THE NEED FOR A TRULY \"NEW MILLENNIUM\" As the global civil standard, the artificial, irregularly measured Gregorian calendar is a self-reinforcing feedback loop. As such, it furthers and maintains all linear time concepts, thereby establishing a host of entropic, disordered value concepts such as the violent universe, the degradation of matter, quantum physics, the arrow oflinear time, the doctrine of techno-economic inexorability, and an attendant host of unresolvable problems-crime, drug abuse, terrorism, environmental deterioration, and so forth. Why? Because as an irregular standard of measure, the Gregorian cal- endar is incapable of producing harmony. Only harmony can unify. The Gregorian calendar is not a unifying harmonic standard. Lack of a unifying global standard exacerbates all current conflicts. Condition the mind to an irregular standard and the mind will adjust to disorder and chaos as normal conditions of existence. The world's racial, tribal, historical, and religious conflicts are embedded in and a function of different timing systems (calendars), all now coordinated within a master The Law of Time in Human Affairs. 73"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"irregular timing standard and macro-organizing principle, the Gregorian calendar. In this calendar's irregularity is embedded the view that the world of the inevitable degradation of matter is the exclusive object of all present-day science, and hence is also reflected in the entropic nature of global civilization and its deteriorating social processes. The Gregorian calendar conditions the mind to hopelessness of resolu- tion. Without a unifying harmonic standard humanity is incapable of finding long- term resolutions for any of its problems. Disharmony can never produce harmony. Only harmony can produce harmony. All conflict can only be resolved by the appli- cation and within the context of a harmonic timing standard. Now, following the attack on the Twin Towers and the Pentagon, we can say that the Gregorian calendar is bringing history to an end. The Inevitable Event was pro- grammed into the Gregorian calendar, and the Gregorian calendar usurped the power of all calendars in the thirteenth and final baktun cycle of history. When the third millennium officially opened at the dawn of the year 2001, the pride of industrial man was at an all-time high. Would it be a millennium of peace or one of war? If the last century of the second millennium was the century of total war, was the third millennium going to do anything but inherit the unfinished programs of the old millennium? Could the Earth and the biosphere withstand a millennium of total war? Hardly. The Vatican \"jubilee year,\" which ended with the beginning of the third millennium, turned sour with the Twin Towers apocalypse, as is vividly re- flected in a photo of Pope John Paul II taken just after the Inevitable Event. The Gregorian calendar marks its inception with the birth of Christ, a date and moment that was never historically noted, and so is shrouded in speculation and conjecture. Now the twisted civilization of Gregorian time is locked in mortal combat against a terroristic specter that it alone could have projected into manifestation. Soon, by biospheric standards, the world of artificial time will be over and gone. And then the millennium will be truly new. The very word millennium conjures possibilities of Earth-shattering events and cosmic prospects. If the inception of the Kali Yuga, 3102 B.C., can be said to be the point where the historical process became irreversible, eleven years after history began in 3113 B.C., then in counterbalance, the Inevitable Event, 2001, which had to occur eleven years before the end of the cycle of history, A.D. 2012, was more than just millennial. It was the termination of more than 5,000 years of the irreversible motion of artificial time. Such symmetry-eleven years after the beginning and eleven years before the end of history-is the hallmark of the synchronic order. For 5,100 years the count of days has numbered the long and increasingly perilous saga of human civilization. How bright was the beginning and how grim will be the end? 7 4 . .

It was only in the thirteenth and final baktun that humans became organized by a single timing standard. However, it was not a timing standard in accord with the synchronic order of the Law of Time, but the artificial 12:60 timing frequency as represented by its two organizing instruments, the Gregorian calendar and the mechanical clock. The seeds of this moment had already been planted in the noosphere at the beginning of history. From both Sumeria and Babylonia the taint of the 12:60 fre- quency then spread through the noosphere and, by means of historical dissemina- tion and conquest, throughout the Old World. By the time the historic moment arrived to ripen the 12:60 frequency into its full fruition-A.D. 1618, the beginning of the scientific revolution and the thirteenth baktun-there were virtually no longer any cultural traditions governed by the natural 13 :20 timing frequency. The civiliza- tions and peoples of the New World were now under the subjugation of the prevail- ing world order of European global imperialism. The stage was set for the brief but final phase of mechanization, of which the technosphere itself is the climax. 7 6 . The Climax of History"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"What the Noospheric Time Map also delineates is that the 13:20 frequency was the unconscious organizing factor of prehistory, and that, undoubtedly, a key timing system intuitively evolved among many prehistoric peoples independently of one another. This was the universal, harmonic solar-lunar standard of the Thir- teen Moon/2 8- Day calendar. The defining point of history arrives with the estab- lishment of a 12:60 timing standard within the noospheric unconscious. This fre- quency predominates in the development of twelve-month pseudosolar calendars, as well as the twelve-month synodicallunation calendars that are not the measure of a solar year. These two commingled systems are entwined throughout the an- cient history of the Old World as the central thread of development shaping the conception of time and resulting in what were to become the two dominant instru- ments of human time reckoning, the Julian/Gregorian calendar and the mechani- cal clock. Julius Caesar himself instituted the famous \"calendar reform\" that created the 446-day year of confusion in 45-44 B.C., and established a calendar that was just as patently confusing. Julius Caesar's was not the only calendar reform in the ancient world. The Essene movement, founded by someone known simply as the Teacher of Righteousness and of which Christ was supposedly a member, began as a revolt against the Hebrew lunar calendar. The issue was the need for fixed holidays within the solar cycle, something that is virtually impossible in a lunar calendar that retrocedes eleven days every solar year. There is strong reason to believe that among other calendars, the Essenes favored the Thirteen Moon/2 8- Day calendar. This even leads to the question: did Christ himself follow a thirteen moon calendar? In any case, it is the 12:60 frequency transmitted through the irrational disorder of the Julian/ Gregorian calendar that captures the mind of the human race and the biosphere during the final years of the cycle of history. And it is precisely for this reason that the pace of human civilization becomes exponentially and entropically accelerated during the last few centuries of its development. Shocked into higher consciousness by its own barbarism masquerading as civili- zation, at the end point of history the human has the opportunity to return to the natural 13:20 frequency of synchronization. This return would mark the emergence of humanity from the unconscious mechanistic compulsion of artificial time into the conscious field of post-history. The only possible option to unify humanity-once the yoke of the Gregorian calendar is removed-is the true solar-lunar calendar of Thirteen Moon/28 Days. With the possibility of this positive end in sight, we may turn to a more descriptive and definitive analysis of the technosphere. In this way understanding the modalities of the technosphere as a distinct and entire process, we The Climax of History. 77"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"might then develop a deeper insight into where we have just been and why we need to go somewhere else. The technosphere defines a 56-year cycle, 1945-2001, coordinated by two com- plete Gregorian 28-year cycles. For any Gregorian calendar year, the days of the weeks in their irregular monthly succession and in relation to the permutation cycle of leap years repeat precisely every twenty-eight years, during which time there are always exactly seven leap years. This means that Gregorian calendar years 1945, 1973, and 2001 possess the same exact annual arrangement of the days of the week in their monthly succession. If today is Sunday, November 11, 2001, so it was in 1973, and likewise in 1945. In this regard the Law of Time frames the cyclic recurrence of the otherwise irregular 12:60 Gregorian calendar by the intrinsic formulation 28:7. That is, just as the 19:7 factor coordinates the lunar calendars every nineteen years, there being seven intercalations of the thirteenth moon during that cycle, so in the Gregorian calendar every twenty-eight years there are always exactly seven leap days and years. Understanding a calendar as the instrument that locks the conditioned programs of a given culture or people into place, we can now understand how the unconscious metaprogram of the macro-organizing principle of the Gregorian calendar cumula- tively recycles all its millennial programs every twenty-eight years. Since its incep- tion in 1582, the Gregorian calendar has been dragging forward a host of condi- tioned thought forms and perceptions, including those inherited from 1,500 years of the Julian calendar that it had reformed. At points of dramatic break in the continu- ity of human consciousness, a new set of cycles is set to recur. Such was the case in the year 1945, with the awesome blast of Hiroshima. The entirety of the mind field conditioned and held in place by the Gregorian calendar then reaches its full frui- tion during the two subsequent 28-year cycles, fifty-six years in all-thus bringing forward two millennia of conditionings, conflicts, and unconscious death wishes or apocalyptic programs. The first cycle was initiated in the year 1945, the year in which Vernadsky died, the atomic bomb was tested once and used twice, and the Second World War came to an end. That year, 1945, marks the beginning of the technospheric bubble. It is most telling that the Second World War was concluded at the beginning of this 56-year cycle of the technosphere, for it was a war concluded not with peace but with instruments of mass destruction and terror. Thus began the 56-year era of Atomic Terror. The technosphere has its origins with the full capture of the human mental field by the 12:60 frequency in 1618. From 1618 onward, the noosphere is increasingly obscured by a mental field known as the technospheric sheath. Slowly but surely, the The Climax of History. 79"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"technospheric sheath replaces civilization. This is first done by the introduction of mechanistic linear time. It is important to note that the Julian count, the basis of all modern scientific calculations, is a scale created by Thomas Scaliger in 1583, twenty- one years after the 1562 Mayan book burning. This linear time scale, like the Gregorian calendar reform itself, was intended to co-opt the Mayan thirteen baktun Long Count by setting a count of days that begins the first of January, 4713 B.C., or some 1,600 years prior to 13.0.0.0.0, the beginning of the thirteen baktun count in 3113 B.C. This deliberate historical act, the Julian count, along with the Gregorian calendar and the mechanical clock, established the paradigmatic notion of the linearity of time in the ripening field of scientific thought. Reflected in the noosphere, this linear, irreversible time concept levels and stunts the realization of human mass consciousness. In fact, during the technospheric cycle, especially after 1754, the ceiling of human conscious- ness is maintained by a preoccupation with mechanistic third-dimensional operations while becoming increasingly alienated from the organic order of reality. This creates the 12:60 consciousness constant, a mental ceiling that actually diminishes in propor- tion to the increasing rates of multiplication, propagation, and intrinsic velocity of the machine. With the actual rise of the Industrial Revolution, dated in the noosphere to A.D. 1754, the synchronic point at which mechanization becomes an irreversible factor of the biosphere, the technospheric sheath, henceforth enters its next stage, going from a purely mental sheath to the industrial sheath, the prelude to the proto-technosphere itself. The industrial sheath spreads throughout the biosphere between 1754 and 1901, the official beginning of the twentieth century. At this point we enter the forty-four years of the proto-technosphere, 1901-1945. During this critical stage of the proto-technosphere, the actions of human behavior interacting with machine technology make the expression of true culture increasingly difficult, if not impos- sible. Civilization becomes a set of symbols purveyed through museums, galleries, and theaters, and recorded and reproduced in ever more advanced technological forms. But what of culture, which is not the same as civilization-what becomes of culture? To begin to answer that question, some further definitions are in order. The technosphere is defined by and based upon one key term: technology. According to the common dictionary definition, which already reflects the mass mind, technology is \"the totality of the means employed to provide objects necessary for human suste- nance and comfort.\"l Today virtually all the means employed are themselves me- chanical in nature. In common parlance, therefore, technology refers to the complex apparatus of mechanization. In fact, technology is mechanization; it is the ability to 80 . The Climax of History"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"convert human labor into processes carried out purely by machine-oriented or me- chanical means. This is also inclusive of the entirety of computer technology, which represents the mechanization of the more purely mental processes of thought and communication. Mechanization, we must remember, originated in the clock, in the mechanization of time. It is the mechanization of time that presupposes the tendency toward mecha- nization as a state of mind within the noosphere. Since artificial time is characterized by the illusion of an inexorable and irreversible linearity, the compulsion toward materialism is also experienced in the same way, an inexorable motion spearheaded by the advance of ever more improved machines. The machines themselves are the products and means of industrialization-the technological transformation of raw goods into consumer goods, a process accounting for much of the free energy intro- duced into the biogeochemical combustion of the biosphere. Inseparable from mechanized technology, too, are materialism and the con- cept of the World Market and, more recently, of globalization. Materialism is im- plicit in the dictionary definition of technology as the means employed not only for human sustenance but also for human comfort. This comfort can only be of a material form or nature, hence the pursuit of comfort through mechanized tech- nology can only be for the furtherance of a philosophy and exaggerated lifestyle of materialism-the belief that only the material things of this world have any value. Of course, the value of material goods and comforts increases when the value of money is put into the technospheric equation. The first stock market opened early in the eighteenth century, providing a place where money could be used as specu- lative capital to promote the advance of commodities and machine products. The entire sphere involving commodity production and its conversion into consumer products eventually came to be known as the World Market. Integral to the suc- cess of the World Market was the creation of the modern banking system, based on the institutionalization of interest rates and the principle of lending money to companies for the purpose of furthering the transformation of the biosphere into the technosphere. While the concept of the World Market prevailed for a long time as the defini- tion of the system for exploiting and extracting natural resources from the biosphere, and then converting them into industrial goods to be consumed by the human popu- lace worldwide, globalization is far more recent. Globalization represents the abso- lute triumph of capitalism as the dominant economic doctrine of the human species in the biosphere, and the absolute basis of the technosphere in its final phase of development. As such, globalization is the economic system of neoliberal market The Climax of History. 81"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"economics that treats the whole world as the proper sphere of its policies and practices. It is a specialized form of monetary imperialism that gives rise to and is supported by the doctrine of monetary politics, the use of money as a means of coercion or even for the buying out of whole governments. Of course, the principle practitioner of monetary politics is the nation with the most money, the United States of America, home of the World Trade Center. Fostering corporate multinationalism, globalization is inseparable from the con- sumer philosophy it promotes. Consumerism is the devaluation of the human into a link in the chain of the cycle of industrial production, the object of globalization being to inspire and promote a massive and wide-scale consumerism worldwide. This is what is meant by such phrases as \"increasing consumer purchasing power\" and \"opening new markets.\" To promote and defend its interests, the all-pervading system of globalization first developed the World Trade Center, and in the last de- cade, following the end of the Cold War, the GAIT and the WTO, the global \"Chamber of Commerce.\" As a political hegemony, globalization is managed by the G-7 group of the seven most industrialized nations (the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Germany, and Japan-now, with Russia, sometimes referred to as the G-8). This organization, headed by the finance ministers of these seven countries-like the seven wise men of Uruk at the beginning of history-was secretly formed in 1974 by the CIA, one year after the completion of the World Trade Center Towers and the formation of OPEC. The first public meeting of the G-7 occurred in the summer of 1990, just prior to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The doctrine and system of globalization-now overtly controlled by the G-7 and its chief ally, the Euromarket nations-is inseparable from industrial technology as the means employed to pro- vide objects necessary for human sustenance and comfort. Implicit in the philosophy of globalization is the right of the G-7 to promote and defend its way of life, regard- less of its ultimate effects on the biosphere and at the expense of ideologies and beliefs not consistent with it. To defend itself, globalization has at its disposal the U.S. military, the command of which is housed by the Pentagon, and the new technospheric multinational military cartel, NATO. In a word, globalization is the triumph of the military-industrial complex. From the point of view of the biosphere, globalization is the cancer of the hu- man species consuming non-renewable resources and, through the release of free energy, effecting the final critical increase in biogeochemical combustion. The plan- etary instrument for furthering the entire process and philosophy of globalization is the technosphere. The technosphere may be defined as the entire apparatus of 82 . The Climax of History"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"mechanized technology and its support philosophy (globalization), understood as an artificial sphere encompassing the globe. As such, the techno sphere is discontinu- ously interspersed within the biosphere. More precisely, the technosphere is located physically and mentally between the biosphere and the noosphere, in other words, between the Earth's vital sphere and its mental envelope. Being the description of an evolutionary stage, the technosphere is governed by the Law of Time as a 56-year event continuum along the lines of an artificial plan- etary cocoon. Insofar as it is the projection of human thought, the technosphere is the materialization of the sum mental processes denoted and conditioned by mecha- nization in all its aspects, and that have their primary root in the mechanization of time. It is the mechanization of time that essentially establishes the artificial timing frequency as the capacity to engender the machine and, consequently, an artificial structure, the technosphere. Because it is artificial, however, its duration is highly limited and is subject to the inherent inconsistencies and contradictions in human thought and social structures because of the aberrant effects of adapting to artificial time in the first place. The effect of adaptation to artificial mechanized time creates a social-political hierarchy known as the technocracy-rule according to the needs of technology. It is the effect of maintaining the technocracy and the technosphere itself that establishes the inability of human consciousness to do anything more than remain in a constant, servile, and unchanging state of machine dominance. All the while, by contrast to the unchanging condition of consciousness, the machines evolve exponentially in number and complexity. As Marshall McLuhan so correctly put it, the humans are the bees of the machine. To be fully understood, the technosphere cannot be seen apart from its place in the biosphere-noosphere continuum. The technosphere represents the absolute control of the biosphere by artificial 12:60 time. Artificial time generates the artifi- cial medium of money, hence the operating philosophy of the technosphere: \"time is money.\" Money is the lifeblood of the technosphere. Servitude to money draws hu- mans away from the biosphere in order to be devoured by Mammon-the technosphere as an all-consuming entity. In this process the humans get money in return for selling their bodies and souls to artificial time, usually eight hours a day, often to produce artificial goods or for service in maintaining the artificial system of money itself. This money gained from servitude is used to buy consumer goods, including more machines of every kind, and thus the human participates as a vital link in the cycle of biogeochemical combustion. In this way the mechanized lifestyle converts the human-the consumer-into the biomass necessary for maintaining the technosphere. The Climax of History. 83"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"As an operating planetary structure, the technosphere consists of five interactive components. 1. COMMODITY PRODUCTION Commodity Production, the basis of the entire World Market as a biospheric system, refers to the transformation of natural resources through industrial means into consumer products. Commodity production alone accounts for the complex of in- dustrialization that brings the World Market and the technosphere into existence. According to The Biosphere Catalogue, the post-World War II growth of the World Market necessitated the establishment of the World Trade Center, a global complex (114 such centers in 1985), but with its principle coordinating unit being the Twin Towers in New York City, home of the World Trade Institute and the corporate offices of the New York Stock Exchange, the key to the world money and commodi- ties market. 2. CITIES Cities, the second technospheric component, represent the human social organism or marketplace for accommodating the production and consumption of industrial goods. Civilization is city life as it has evolved from Uruk to New York (= New Uruk). While prior to industrialization the city depended on a healthy agrarian economy for its support, industrialization pushed the city to new heights of artifici- ality, not the least of which were round-the-clock lighting systems that allowed for 24-hour consumer markets. As such, the city is the nucleus of the technospheric system, the hub of its commodity production, of its energy consumption, and of its transport and communication empires. The growth of the cities around the world is exponential in the second half of the twentieth century, reflecting the triumph of the technosphere. It should be noted that in the fifty-six years of the technosphere, the human population almost tripled-from 2.2 to 6.2 billion, a growth demonstrated in the vast expansion of the large urban centers. 3. ENERGY Energy is the third component of the technospheric complex. The tremendous needs of industrial production have transformed the natural energy processes of the bio- sphere into gigantic artificial complexes for the production of energy to maintain factory and city alike. The impact of the different artificial energy systems upon the biosphere has been enormous. These systems include coal, oil, and fossil fuels in general, as well as hydropower and nuclear energy. The whole syndrome of artificial The Climax of History. 85"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"time, artificial means, acceleration of the machine, and expansion of human popula- tion has required and created the enormous output of artificial energy into the bio- sphere and contributed greatly to the destabilization and loss of natural resources and atmospheric and hydrospheric contamination through the release of toxic \"free energy\" by-products. 4. TRANSPORT Transport. Without the highly industrialized transport systems, the commodity pro- duction, the vitality of the cities, and the access to provisions of fuel required for the energy systems would collapse. No sooner had industrial production begun early in the eighteenth century than the first artificial transport systems came into being: the steam- or coal-driven locomotive, and the great transoceanic shipping lines. By the twentieth century, the railroad system and worldwide shipping industry were supple- mented by the invention of the combustion engine, which made the trucking indus- try possible. Following World War II, rocketry and jet propulsion established the transportation might of the great airline companies of the second half of the twenti- eth century. It is no coincidence that commercial airplanes, the symbol of the technosphere's advanced transport systems, were used to bring down the Twin Tow- ers and to penetrate the Pentagon. 5. COMMUNICATION Communication is the fifth component that unifies the technosphere into one whole system in touch with itself everywhere. From telegraph to telephone, radio, televi- sion, and then finally fax, cell phone, and the Internet, the industrial-era technolo- gies, with their electronic instantaneity, have created the vast communication net- works and media empires that keep the world humming and promote globalization above all. When considering modern communication we must also bring into focus the chief method of globalization, which is marketing-propaganda on behalf of consumerism. Marketing is the use of means of mass communication to control the mind of the consumer. In the final stage of globalization, marketing replaces con- sciousness, or rather, marketing is the manipulation of consciousness-the latter already having been reduced to a stunted level-for purposes of consumerism, or for ideological needs such as patriotism and fear campaigns. The Internet, the marriage of computer and telephone technologies, represents the final stage of the Tower of Babel, and the completion of the process of globalization. The only place to go after the Internet is technology-free telepathy. 8 6 . The Climax of History"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"From the biospheric perspective, this five-tiered complex of the technosphere is a whole unit. All the subsystems evolved together to establish the structure and operat- ing procedures of the technosphere. When the technosphere goes, the entire system folds. This is what is now beginning to occur. Following the Inevitable Event, the whole technospheric system will be coming down slowly over the next few years, like a giant circus tent that has lost its central prop. How gracefully or gracelessly this happens is dependent on the response of the Pentagon-or the will of humanity to rouse itself in the face of even worse barbarisms. Because it consists of five interactive components, the techno sphere can be graphi- cally depicted as a pentagon, a five-sided figure. At the center of this pentagon of the technosphere are the World Trade Center Twin Towers. The actual Pentagon, which was attacked along with the Twin Towers, was designed in the late 1930s to house the U.S. Department of War. Its construction occurred in the years 1941-1943, in an old neighborhood of pawnshops and bars called Hell's Bottom.2 When it was built it was the world's largest office building in terms of actual space. Of course, when they were built, the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center were the world's tallest office buildings.

The Pentagon was the impregnable fortress of the American war machine, protecting American in- terests and globalization around the world. If there were two central points-actual and symbolic-to what is known as the military-industrial complex, it was the Pen- tagon and the World Trade Center, and this is undoubtedly the reason why they were both targets of the Inevitable Event. What is architecturally noteworthy about the Pentagon is that it is designed with five inner pentagonal corridors and office slabs, and that it is constructed with its odd point to the south. Since a pentagon is actually a pentagram, a five-pointed star with its points connected, the Pentagon represents an inverted pentagram, as its odd point faces south rather than north. In the traditional Tarot deck it is interesting that the Fifteenth Major Arcana, The Devil, contains an inverted pentagram between the horns of the Beast. Paul Foster Case writes, \"This is a key to the whole meaning of the figure [of the devil]. For the Penta- gram is the symbol of man, and an inverted Pentagram suggests the reversal of true understanding of man's place in the cosmos.\"3 While the Fifteenth Major Arcana con- tains the pentagon as the inverted pentagram, the next card, the Sixteenth Arcana, is The Tower, which shows the tower being struck and broken apart by lightning (fire of heaven), with humans falling or jumping out of the windows to their death-as accurate a symbolic depiction of the collapse of the Twin Towers as could be found. VYhat the startling conjunction of these symbolic correspondences points to is the profoundly archetypal nature of the Inevi- table Event. It has been prefigured and prophesied, and has now come to pass. No matter how much America and its allies, many of them bought for a price, may strike back, the deed has been done.

As we have shown, the technosphere is a structure totally brought about by the 12:60 timing frequency, and thus is purely a function of the latter. As such, the technosphere is embedded in the global macro-organizing principle of the 12:60 fre- quency, the Gregorian calendar. Two 28-year cycles, each one divided into four 7-year subcycles, define the duration of the technosphere. Remember that the Gregorian calendar repeats every twenty-eight years. As we have pointed out, the 56-year cycle of the technosphere, 1945-2001, is preceded by the 44-year cycle of the proto- technosphere. The two World Wars were a function of the proto-technosphere, the final major act being the construction of the Pentagon, specifically for consolidating the American war machine-the world's largest office building means that the world's largest business is war, with a $318 billion budget for the year 2001-2002 alone! The fifty-six years between Hiroshima and the Inevitable Event were the age of terror, for it was atomic terror that initiated the technosphere in a baptism of nuclear fire, and in the end, it was an unimaginable suicidal terror that brought down not just one, but both of the Twin Towers of Babel. The final collapse of the technosphere is also the final war between blood and money. Artificial time has run out.

The UN now has the task of keeping World War III from happening by providing a forum where the \"superpowers\" can keep their cold war from heating up, and that will contain and manage the spread of nuclear power. Nonetheless, the terror of the Bomb as the ultimate deterrent engenders the arms race. Soon Russia, the United Kingdom, France, and eventually China get the Bomb. War in Indochina, the establishment of the Israeli state in Palestine (1948) at the expense of the sover- eignty of the Palestinian people, and the completion of the Chinese Marxist Revolu- tion under Chairman Mao are the highlights of 1949, followed by the Korean War in 1950. All this demonstrates the instability of the world. At the same time, 1949, commercial television production begins in the United States; the age of radio is replaced by the \"tube.\" Americans also begin building freeways and the new system ofInterstate highways marking the triumph of \"automobile culture,\" and the begin- ning of the suburban consumer lifestyle. 2. 1952-1958. CYCLE OF THE OPENING OF THE TOMB AND THE BEGINNING OF THE SPACE AGE. In the summer of 1952 a Cuban archaeologist discovers the tomb of the Mayan sage, Pacal Votan. This unprecedented archaeological event marks the beginning of the final sixty years-three katun cycles-of the Mayan thirteen baktun cycle of history. In the following year, 1953, the superlethal H-bomb is tested. The DNA code is discovered, as are the Earth's radiation belts. The United States and Russia conduct numerous nuclear weapons tests in Nevada, Siberia, and the Pacific Ocean. Wars for independence occur in various African states, and in general the era of European imperialism is at an end, followed by the neo-colonialist (Third World) era of guer- rilla warfare, poverty, and social instability. In 1956, the year the Russians launch the first sputnik and begin the space age, the United Nations tables the issue of calendar reform indefinitely, thus closing the chapter begun when the League of Nations proposed global calendar reform in 1931. The year 1956 also marks the beginning of the electronic pop culture of the technosphere, rock and roll. By the end of this cycle, the \"space race\" joins the arms race as a force in promoting the advance of the technosphere. Commercial airlines adapt to jet propulsion, and the great age of air 90 .

A small fast-food franchise named McDonald's opens in the United States. 3. 1959-1965. CYCLE OF THE ATOMIC MIND EXPLOSION. The July 26 Cuban Revolution of Fidel Castro, triumphant in 1959, establishes a communist state in the Americas and heightens the Cold War. That same year the Chinese communists bring to a definitive end the rule of the Dalai Lama in Tibet. In the Congo, the popular hero Patrice Lumumba is assassinated after only two months in office. Also in 1960, the human population hits three billion, an increase of one billion since 1930. In 1961 the Institute of Mathematics of the Siberian Branch of the Soviet Academy of Sciences begins the monumental mathematical analysis of Mayan hieroglyphic texts. The attempted 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba is fol- lowed in 1963 with the assassination ofJohn F. Kennedy, an act that reflects a rising level of cultural turmoil in the United States. Martin Luther King Jr. emerges as a popular hero of nonviolence and civil rights, an issue that points to a more radical discontent in America, culminating in 1965 with the Watts race riots. Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring (1963) signals the rise of ecological awareness. The Beatles transform rock and roll into a world-class cultural phenomenon that foments a widespread countercultural movement and atomic mind explosion, fueled by Timothy Leary, LSD, hippies, and the new antiwar movement against the conflict in Vietnam. In 1961 Yuri Gagarin is the first man in space, and the Vatican II Ecumenical Council comes to the conclusion that the best way the Church will survive in the next cen- tury is through a strong Pope. The Vatican II document also includes an appendix on calendar reform, the wording of which makes it difficult for there to be any alter- native but a watered-down version of the Gregorian calendar. This act seals the technosphere within the unquestioned confines of Gregorian time, ultimately turn- ing the atomic mind explosion in on itself. 4. 1966-1972. FROM THE WHOLE EARTH TO THE WORLD TRADE CENTER: THE TRIUMPH OF THE WORLD MARKET. In 1966 construction begins on the World Trade Center Twin Towers, while in 1968 World Trade Centers are independently established in Houston, New Orleans, and Tokyo. That same year, UNESCO hosts the first and only conference on the bio- sphere ever sponsored by the United Nations, \"Man and the Biosphere\" (MAE), but the program slowly dies on the vine.

This ferment includes: race riots, antiwar riots, a march on the Pentagon, the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy, and riots in major capitals around the world and on both sides of the iron curtain, as well as the Maoist cultural revolution in China. The excitement of the '60s climaxes in 1969 with the success of the Apollo XIII manned mission to the moon and the consequent feedback factor of the human race seeing itself instantaneously on television as the whole Earth beamed from space, an opening to the noosphere. Apollo XIII initiates the next phase of the space race, travel to other planets. Also in 1969, the Woodstock concert marks the apex of the early rock-and-roll culture and the visionary climax of the cultural revolution. The 1971 Concert for Bangladesh establishes rock and roll with a conscience. In 1970 the vision of the whole Earth is translated into the first Earth Day and the birth of the ecology movement. The United Nations follows two years later with the Stockholm Conference on the Environment. The revolutionary fervor of the previ- ous years turns more violent, and repressive governmental police powers win the day. The first 28-year cycle ends with a whimper, the dynamic destabilization of consciousness reaches a plateau of normalcy-a normalcy to be increasingly punctu- ated by terrorist activity, as in the Palestinian takeover of the Olympic Village in September 1972. Both apart from as well as in reaction to such activity, the technosphere has now become all-dominant and all-powerful in human affairs. SUMMARY, GREGORIAN A: 1945-1972 During this cycle, the dynamic of the accelerated geochemical combustion destabi- lizes the human consciousness while increasing the curve of the machine in human affairs. By 1973 the machine curve meets and surpasses the human population curve; this stabilizes human consciousness at a level of machine normalcy (MN). Human consciousness will remain stabilized at MN, largely through varying forms of terror and fear programming, for the duration of the second and final 28-year cycle. This normalization of human consciousness allows the diverse and rapidly evolving tech- nological components of the technosphere to reach a point of consolidation. This stabilization of the World Market fosters its next and concluding phase: globalization and the triumph of marketing over human culture. It should be kept in mind that the instruments and weapons of mass destruction, of which there were none on January 1, 1945, have now proliferated to five different countries and provide the ultimate backdrop to these first twenty-eight years.

The dedication of the World Trade Center Twin Towers on April 4, 1973 (a repeat of the calendar year of the Bomb, 1945) is the counterpart to the construction of the Pentagon (1940-1941), which sponsored the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Simultaneous to the dedication of the Twin Towers is the formation of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). With the exception of Venezuela, OPEC is largely an Arabic (Islamic) eco- nomic alliance that, for the first time in the history of the technosphere, brings a Third World influence into planetary politics. The subsequent \"oil shortage\" demonstrates the technosphere's vulnerability, which in turn causes a further \"hardening of the ar- teries\" of its consciousness-the covert formation by the CIA of the G-7. Also in 1973, after five years of study the Club of Rome issues The Limits of Growth, which in its analysis of trends foresees a major environmental (biospheric) crisis within one hundred years, yet nonetheless establishes and promotes the standard world model, a setting of production quotas at the 1973 level, to foster sustainable growth at least until 2020. The \"standard world model\" corresponds to the \"normalization\" of con- sciousness. The third war (previous ones having occurred in 1967 and 1949) between Israel and its neighbors occurs this year. By 1975, the world population is at four billion, up a billion since 1960. In 1976 Voyager II reaches Mars. In 1978 Karol Wojtyla becomes Pope John Paul II, the first global Pope, fulfilling the Vatican Council's re- quirements of a popular Pope to assure the survival of the Church into the next cen- tury. With Gregorian civilization triumphant, Mexico, home of the Maya, is the first country visited by the new Pope. In the same period, between 1978 and 1979, the Iranian Islamic revolution occurs, toppling the pro-Western Shah, signaling a height- ened conservative Islamic resistance to Westernization and the technosphere. Japa- nese technology and corporate capitalist economy flourish, capped by the construc- tion in Tokyo of the \"New City\" Shinjuku and, despite many environmental protests, the Narita airport. The mainstream global consciousness is now \"comfortably numb\" and on course to unprecedented materialism. 2. 1980-1986. CYCLE OF THE TRIUMPH OF THE TECHNO SPHERE. The first cycle of the stabilized new normalcy establishes the triumph of market- ing-the election of a second-rate American movie star for President, and the birth of the yuppie (young urban professional) generation of America. The rise of MTV signals the standardization of rock style as global culture; while the Live Aid global television concert on July 13, 1985, to raise awareness of AIDS in Africa, is the largest ever of its kind. The September 17, 1985 Mexico City earthquake, the worst in modern times to hit the world's largest city, demonstrates the continuing vulner- ability of the techno sphere to natural catastrophe. The early 1980s witness the Intifadah uprising of Palestinians against Israel. The War on Drugs, an aggressive 9 4 . .

In 1986 President Reagan attacks Kadafy of Libya and invades Grenada, testing American ability to commit lim- ited acts of aggression without inciting world censure. The construction of Biosphere II in Arizona, an effort to test the possibility of establishing an artificial biosphere on other planets, ends inconclusively. In 1985 in Bhophal, India, the worst modern indus- trial toxic chemical disaster occurs with more than 2,000 deaths, followed on April 26, 1986 by the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster, the worst since the beginning of the nuclear age. In America the suburban automobile culture gives rise to the super shopping malls. The personal computer (PC) is introduced, while electronic game arcades flourish. Sunday football becomes the major American television pastime, while television itself makes world soccer the number one competitive global sport; the broad- cast of professional sports assumes the role of a primary noospheric diversion. 3. 1987-1993. CYCLE OF THE END OF THE COLD WAR AND TRIUMPH OF THE G-7. On January 24, 1987 Voyager II sends back photos from Uranus; four days later, January 28, 1987, seven American astronauts die in a shuttle launch explosion. On August 16-17, 1987 the Harmonic Convergence peace meditation attracts hundreds of thousands who gather at sacred and natural sites around the world; later that year, October 19, 1987, the New York StockMarket crash occurs, the biggest point drop ever, and Russian Prime Minister Gorbachev initiates disarmament accord, or glasnost. By the end of 1987 the population is at five billion, up one billion since 1975. During 1988-1989, a rolling wave oflargely peaceful revolutions and civil uprisings through- out most of the Warsaw pact nations culminates on December 31, 1989 with the tearing down of the Berlin Wall-the end of the Cold War. At the same time, Presi- dent Bush invades Panama to continue testing Drug Wars and limited-aggression capability. In the summer of 1990 an international bankers' reunion is followed by the first public meeting of the G-7. Every year henceforth, the G-7 meets publicly to set policy for globalization. Within a month of the first public G-7 meeting, Au- gust 1990, Saddam Hussein invades Kuwait, and Bush retaliates with the Gulf War, January-February 1991. In August 1991 Gorbachev is ousted in a putsch, marking the end of the Russian Marxist era. Destabilization, war, and genocide afflict the Balkans.

Meanwhile, with the absence of Marxist Russian economic influence, the neoliberal capitalist economics of America flourish as full-blown globalization, multinational cor- porations, and the prominence of the IMF and World Bank foment a uniform global corporate culture of cheap consumer services and franchised retail outlets for brand- name goods. This period also sees the rise of East Asian capitalist economies, although the Japanese economic bubble bursts in 1991. Early in 1993 a terrorist bomb explodes in the underground garage of the World Trade Center Twin Towers. The period 1989- 1993 marks the beginning of the discovery of the Law of Time-the definition of the artificial 12:60 and natural 13:20 timing frequencies, the Dreamspell codes, and the decoding of the Telektonon Prophecy of Pacal Votan in 1993. 4. 1994-2000. CYCLE OF THE CLIMAX OF GLOBALIZATION. In 1994, the GAIT Treaty is signed, the Levy-Shoemaker comet hits Jupiter, and a million Mricans die in the Rwanda massacre. The indigenous uprising in Chiapas, Mexico on January 1, 1994 provides a counterpoint to the triumph of globalization that is manifest through worldwide airport expansions, and an aggressive form of tourism that feeds the airline industry. Israel and Palestine enter the \"peace process,\" while Yeltsin consolidates his power in Russia. This is the era of United Nations peace- keeping missions, mostly in the Balkans and Africa. Following the FBI/BATF -inflicted firestorm on a fundamentalist compound in Waco, Texas, a year later, in 1995, a ter- rorist bomb destroys the Oklahoma City Federal Building. The United States and the United Kingdom inaugurate control ofIraqi no-fly zones, enforced by regular bomb- ing raids; the United States also conducts military actions in Somalia, as well as more successful ones in Haiti. This is the era of rapid expansion of computer and biotech- nologies, exponential rise of New York Stock Exchange and the new specialized tech- nologies exchange, the NASDAQ. Bill Gates of Microsoft typifies the rise of the new self-made billionaires of the Clinton era. In January 1995 the Kyoto earthquake oc- curs, followed by the Tokyo subway nerve-gas terrorist attack, while the Internet, the \"information superhighway,\" is fully up and running.

On Rosh Hashanah, September 28,2000, Hebrew year 5761, Israeli leader Ariel Sharon's presence at Temple of the Mount, Jerusalem, sparks a new Intifadah of Palestinians, which continues un- abated through 2001, the official first year of the new millennium. 5. 2001-? GOTTERDAMMERUNG OF THE TECHNO SPHERE: FIRST YEAR OF THE THIRD MILLENNIUM, REPEAT OF GREGORIAN CALENDAR YEARS 1945 AND 1973. In July 2001, G-7 meets in Genoa, Italy, as more than 100,000 anti-globalization protesters riot. In early September the United States and Israel walk out of the United Nations Conference on Racism in South Africa. Then, within ten days occurs the Inevitable Event, Gregorian 9-11, 2001, the cumulative synchronic pressure point where the technospheric bubble-the artificial time warp in the noosphere-bursts open, spawning in its wake the full-scale War on Terrorism-another name for World War III. The Inevitable Event exemplifies the built-in failure of the Gregorian calen- dar to commence another 28-year cycle as was done in 1945 and 1973. If the 1945 cycle began with the end of one world war, the 2001 cycle begins with the start of one. Since 2001 is also first year of the third millennium, the Gregorian calendar has cre- ated its own apocalypse, opening a noospheric fissure-the climax of the biogeochemical combustion of the biosphere. Now it is only a matter of time before the technosphere experiences total collapse. The nature and extent of the damage sustained during the collapse is in proportion to the intelligence that responds to the knowledge of its col- lapsing. If this 2 8-year Gregorian calendar cycle were to go unimpeded until 2029, it is not certain what would be left of the biosphere. But there is one thing of which we may be certain: artificial, linear time has run out. An American newspaper editorial at the end of 2001 sums up the crash of the dominant linear time paradigm: \"History seems to have slammed into reverse gear around a world that was widely assumed a year ago to be moving in a straight line toward a more prosperous and secular future, one that would be shaped by stock markets and the Internet, not by turbaned zealots or theocra- cies that have or want nuclear trigger fingers.\"4 The Climax of History. 97"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"SUMMARY, GREGORIAN B: 1973-2001 With destabilization normalized, the technosphere replaces civilization and marks the end of culture-the new barbarism prevails, culminating in total war. The 9-11 is what actually completes the technospheric cycle. Henceforth it will be the advent of the noosphere, but not in the way predicted by the authors of The Biosphere Cata- log: \"The Noosphere as an active force consists in the harmonious synthesis of the Biosphere and the Technosphere by intelligence.\"5 By the analysis of the Law of Time, the intelligence is nowhere evident because there is no harmony of intelli- gence possible under the present timing standards that dominate all the major play- ers in the present global conflict. Since the technosphere is totally a function of the artificial timing frequency, and since artificial time is now short-circuiting itself, there will be no techno sphere to harmonize when natural time is restored to the entire biosphere. Then the noosphere will commence, but only if there is world harmony. Only a harmonic standard will bring harmony to the world. The failure of the Gregorian calendar and its civilization, crystallized in the now-collapsing technosphere, must be quickly acknowledged. By adopting a harmonic standard as soon as possible, the shift to the noosphere can commence, rising and building itself up from the shards and ashes of the toppled technosphere. 98 .

Instead of operating as a planetary organism in absolute synchronization with a knowledge of being coordinated by a common har- monic standard, humans race toward the end of history, dissynchronously operating under a plethora of calendars of differing measures enshrining competing belief sys- tems, all globally coordinated by an instrument of irregular measure and obscure nomenclature-the Gregorian calendar. Dissynchronized and at odds with itself ev- erywhere, humanity is broken apart into splintered mind fields, each controlled by a different timing standard, a fact about which the human race is virtually ignorant- to its own detriment.

India has the Bomb, Pakistan has the Bomb, China has the Bomb. The United States has the Bomb, the United Kingdom has the Bomb. France has the Bomb. Russia, the Ukraine, and other former Soviet nations have the Bomb. It is commonly assumed that Israel also possesses the Bomb. Does Iraq have the Bomb? Can a terrorist get access to materials to create the Bomb as well? The nuclear clock is ticking again. The number of weapons and technologies of mass destruction has increased several thousandfold since 1945 when, at the time ofVernadsky's death, there were virtually none. This is not to mention the biological weapons of mass destruction, more ambiguous, more lethal, more hidden-none of which really existed in 1945 either. With the fallout from the Inevitable Event an anarchic planetary free-for-all is taking shape. From the noospheric point of view, the humans have run out of (artificial) time, and are now committing their last egoistic act of desperation to hold what they perceive to be their dominant place in the scheme of things. The fact is, however, that the planet belongs to the biosphere and not to the humans. The inability of the Gregorian calendar to sustain another 28-year cycle, much less another millennium, means that an anarchy of time and a time of anarchy is loosed upon the planet. At the present rate, what would the world look like in 2029? One does not want to imagine. The anarchy of time is exemplified by the different competing powers that are unconsciously driven and motivated by programs stored in their differing calendar systems. This failure of artificial time to contain itself is truly the apocalypse. The apocalypse could occur only when the time program had become saturated. The two 28-year cycles, 1945-2001, carried forward not only the exponential advance of machine time, but the accrued karmic baggage of two mil- lennia of the invented religion of Christ. Throughout the last millennium, the pro- tagonists of this religion waged a type of holy war against an embattled world-a war waged by missionaries and conquistadors alike, down to this very day. The week before the Inevitable Event, the Taliban was deporting Christian missionaries from Mghanistan, while other Christian missionaries scour the jungles looking for one more indigenous soul to convert.

I 0 I"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"THE AGE OF THE TIME WARS The Time Wars began with the application of the error in time at Uruk: the 24- hour, 60-minute, 60-second timing frequency derived from a 12-part division of the circle, a two-dimensional plane in space. Since this measure does not correspond to the reality of time as the universal (13 :20) frequency of synchronization, it creates a mental dissynchronization that manifests as the battle of the mind against itself, and against nature. The dynam'ic of the \"progress\" of civilization is really the dynamic of dissynchronization inherited by the human mind. The gradual encroachment of civi- lization into all aspects of human society and the biosphere increases the incidence of dissynchronization. The resulting aphasic mental states lead to belligerence and various attitudes of dominance over others and nature-but never to any satisfaction. Viewed by the Law of Time, civilization is the institutionalization and embodi- ment of the dissynchronous artificial timing frequency. The dynamic of dis- synchronization results in increasingly artificial technological means and reliance on the artificial medium of money to replace the biological or organic functions of our nature and of the biosphere in general. Not only does this process tend toward an \"improvement\" in the accuracy of the means of war, but also in the capacity of the latter for greater mass destruction. Set apart from the natural cycles by the dissynchronous frequency of mechanization, the Time Wars are also waged against the biosphere, which is viewed as a hostile force to be overwhelmed and plundered. Everywhere on Earth, nature is on the run. Everywhere on Earth, the human looks at his watch-what will he do next? Catch another plane? Fire another bullet? Press another button and let loose another bomb? The 56-year cycle of the technosphere witnessed the greatest creation and stock- piling of lethal weapons, more than in all the previous history put together, enough to destroy the Earth many times over. The 56-year cycle of the techno sphere also witnessed the greatest plundering thus far of the biosphere, more than in all the previous cycles of history put together. Continued at the current rate, the biospheric plunder would bring extinction to virtually all life within another generation. These two facets of self-destruction-technospheric and biospheric-point again to the Inevitable Event. It is the Pentagon that has led in military spending and strategizing, just as it was the activity within the World Trade Center Twin Towers that domi- nated and coordinated from afar the plunder of the biosphere-both precedents for the consequent construction and expansion of the technosphere. But now time has run out on the technosphere. The world has gone flat and valueless with no future vision beyond war. All the money in the world will not put it I 02 .

Who are the enemies of the technosphere, and what would cause thereto be enemies against the technosphere? And who or what is there that speaks for the biosphere? For if the biosphere is to become the noosphere, it must come about from an under- standing of the intelligence of harmony. Clearly, such understanding of harmonic intelligence has not been nor will it be forthcoming from the technosphere-or from the Gregorian calendar that programs it. Only the Law of Time can supply the harmony necessary to complete this great movement from biogeochemical combus- tion to noospheric mind. The Law of Time replaces all that is artificial, while con- firming all that is true, whether in human history or the universe. Let us return to the analysis of the Time Wars and the clash of timing programs. The Twin Towers were the absolute triumph of the artificial 12:60 timing frequency, whose program is embedded in the Gregorian calendar and paced by the mechanical clock. Who steered the hijacked planes into their Gregorian targets? Nineteen mili- tant Muslims, we are told. Why nineteen? And what are the religious backgrounds of the twenty-two most-wanted terrorists in the world? They are twenty-two Mus- lims. Why that number, and why are all the terrorists Muslims? In the noospheric analysis, the Inevitable Event was the suicide of the technosphere unable to sustain two clashing time programs. It was a program of the strict Islamic twelve-month lunar calendar that drove its belief system into the Twin Towers and the Pentagon, the two supreme monuments of the program of the twelve unevenly measured months of the Gregorian pseudosolar calendar. Is it Islam that is the enemy of the technosphere? Is it Islam that is the champion of the biosphere? Indeed what is Islam? Why is Islam the most resistant force against globalization and the technosphere? We know where the Vatican, the bastion of Christendom, is and who ordained the Gregorian calendar, but what do we know about Islam? If we strip history away from the force known as Islam (1.3 billion Muslims in the world), and reduce it to its most essential point, then Islam is the teaching of the Holy Quran. What is the Holy Quran? It is the last whole revealed text for all hu- manity, received and recorded over a 23-year period by a single human being, Muhammad the prophet (570-632). While militant Muslims and terrorists have dominated the mass media image ofIslam for the past few decades, what is the Quran and what does it actually teach? It is also a function of the Gregorian program that scarcely anyone in the West really knows or is familiar with the Quran, since the West has been at odds with Islam since the time of Muhammad. As the supreme text of monotheism, the Quran is actually a psychoactive book that upholds Islam as the final religion for humanity. \"He is the one who sent His messenger with the The Solution of the Law of Time.

Within the vast system of intricate, mathematically based logic that constitutes the Quran-which is a profoundly ahistorical text as well- one feature stands out: the description and definition of nature and the natural order as the chief proof of God's design and guiding wisdom. From the Quranic point of view, the biosphere, inclusive of the creation of the human, is the overwhelming single proof of God's wisdom in establishing a life-support system for our indwelling con- sciousness to evolve our bodies on this Earth. The biosphere is Islam, or \"peace, which is submission to the will of God,\" understood as the divine law of nature. In the creation of the heavens and the earth, the alternation of night and day, the ships that roam the ocean for the benefit of the people, the water that God sends down from the sky to revive dead land and to spread in it all kinds of creatures, the manipulation of the winds, and the clouds that are placed between the sky and the earth, there are sufficient proofs for people who understand. (2:164) He created you from one person, then created from him a mate. He sent down to you eight kinds of livestock. He creates you in your mother's bellies, creation after creation, in trimesters of darkness. Such is God your Lord. To Him belongs all sovereignty. There is no other god beside Him. How could you deviate? (39:6) Among His proofs is that you see the land still, then as soon as we shower it with water, it vibrates with life. Surely the One who revived it can revive the dead. He is Omnipotent. (41:39) He created the human from a tiny drop, then he turns into an ardent opponent. And he created the livestock for you, to provide you with warmth and many other ben- efits as well as food. They also provide you with luxury during your leisure, and when you travel. And they carry your loads to lands that you could not reach with- out a great hardship. Surely your Lord is Compassionate, most Merciful. (16:4-7) He sends down from the sky water for your drink and to grow trees for your benefit. With it, He grows for you crops, olives, date palms, grapes, and all kinds of fruits. This is sufficient proof for people who think. (16: 10-11) And He committed the sea to serve you; you eat from it tender meat, and extract jewelry which you wear. And you see the ships roaming it for your commercial ben- efits, as you seek His bounties, that you may be appreciative. And He placed stabiliz- I O 4 . .

And landmarks, as well as the stars to be used in navigation. Is One who creates like one who does not create? Would you now take heed? (16: 14-17) As for the Earth, we constructed it, and placed on it stabilizers (mountains) and we grew on it a perfect balance of everything. We made it habitable for you, and for creatures you do not provide for. There is nothing that we do not own infinite amounts thereof. But we send it down in precise measure. And we send the winds as pollina- tors, and cause water to come down from the sky for you to drink. Otherwise you could not keep it palatable. (15: 19-22)2 Viewed from its own context, the Quran is the criterion for evaluating the spiri- tual progress of human existence on this Earth inclusive of man's ability to read the proofs of nature as manifestations of God's wisdom and to comport himself within this nature, the biospheric life-support system, in a manner consistent with the truth. From the Quranic perspective, human freedom of choice is at the root of the bio- spheric destruction. Choosing anything but to be submissive to God, the human is in rebellion against nature-both his own and that of the biosphere. \"We have of- fered the responsibility [freedom of choice] to the heavens, and the earth, and the mountains, but they refused to bear it, and were afraid of it. But the human being accepted it; he was transgressing, ignorant.\" (33:72) The result of this ignorance on behalf of his own aims and intentions rather than that of a respect for the divine plan (biosphere) of the Creator, accounts for the human situation today, at odds with and surrounded by an increasingly out-of-control biospheric degradation and corruption of natural time: \"Disasters have spread throughout the land and sea, because of what the people have committed. He [God] thus lets them taste the consequences of some of their works, that they may return [to the right works].\" (30:41) Thus, the current techno spheric destruction actually points toward a return of humans to the path of right works. The forces that created the phenomenon of historical Islam are the enclosing of the Holy Quran within the rigid system of a twelve-month, non-circulating lunar calendar, compounded and supported by the development of the hadith and sunna (non-Quranic) traditions. A profoundly conservative social order, Islam is nonethe- less activated and motivated by a holy scripture that enunciates an attitude toward nature that is the direct opposite of the 12:60 system that produced the technosphere. In this regard, the precepts of the Holy Quran-as of many another holy scripture- make it the \"enemy\" of the technosphere.

In this way, the Quran was the noosphere's weapon used to bring about the circum- stances that would lead to the resurrection of the biosphere-the noosphere itself. But only if man consciously chooses the right return path: synchronized harmony in time. The problem is not so much the rigid lunar calendar ofIslam, but the irregular global standard of the Gregorian calendar, which, instead of standardizing all mea- sures and perceptions of time, fosters a human social disharmony and an incessant antagonism against nature-and against Islam. So then, how are we to return to the right works? Read and study the Quran, yes-but also make a fundamental change in the world. The solution of the Law of Time is: Get a new calendar! Humanity must take a long, hard look at its own timing systems and scrap what needs to be scrapped, no matter what kind of temporary inconveniences this may cause. Calendar reform is an issue that upsets many apple carts. Yet it is the only method that has not been commonly tried and the only step that has not yet been collectively taken. It is a characteristic of the dominant mind- set that it writes history in the way that suits its own needs and supports its philoso- phy. In any of the reviews of the century carried by the mass media during the past year, you will find no mention of the World Calendar Reform Movement; nor will you find, for instance, any mention of the Roerich Peace Pact (1935); nor of the Harmonic Convergence-all buried by the marketing of history to suit the needs of globalization. What do these three phenomena have in common? A concern for peace based on an understanding that without harmony, the human cultural situa- tion will only worsen. If humankind suffers from an excess of disharmony, in the noospheric analysis the only solution is a harmonic standard of time to synchronize all humanity simultaneously-the Law of Time refers to this as the Thirteen Moon! 28- Day frequency shift.

If you want to know that something has really changed, change the calendar! This is the meaning of the replacement of the Gregorian calendar by the Thirteen Moon calendar. The calendar change is necessary because, as the pragmatic application of the discovery of the Law of Time, it brings into focus the essence of this discovery: Time is a frequency, the frequency of synchronization. If a calendar does not in- crease synchronization, it is not performing its highest function. This is the funda- mental critique of the Gregorian calendar-and of all concepts of time based solely on physical, third-dimensional astronomical measurements. This discovery is so new and startling that it affects all human thought and is a matter to which all belief systems, religions, and methods of science must be cognizant. Yet nothing, it seems, is more difficult for humanity than to make this change from a manifest disharmony to a manifest harmony. Historical man recoils at the prospect of actual harmony-harmony in natural time. This is because historical man defines his existence and thrives upon the dis- harmonies of his own invented time. The Gregorian calendar keeps the human mind entrained in a diabolical disorder of meaninglessly named months of uneven mea- sure, while every day is tracked and driven by a relentless mechanism called a clock. This immersion of the mind of historical man in the frequency of his own artificial time, more than any other factor, condemns him to a world of inescapable horrors: traffic jams, poverty, terrorism, unresolvable historical and territorial disputes, glo- bal warming, environmental degradation, social disorder, insanity, and drug abuse. The problem of historical human-Homo historicus-is compounded by the uncon- scious nature of his acceptance of this timing sensibility, believing it to be the actual nature of time. Hence, all his public and economic policies are driven by and deter- mined by the relentlessness of this perception that time is an arrow blindly pulling him into a future in which his only defense is the creation of more technology, the technosphere itself being a pure expression of the application of the mechanization of time. THE SECRET HISTORY OF CALENDAR REFORM When you went to bed on October 5,1582 you woke up on October 16. In this way Pope Gregory XIII promulgated his reform of the Julian calendar, from which the Gregorian calendar differs not one whit, except for the precise working out of the formula for leap year. When this \"reform\" occurred, the time sensibility of historical man was already crippled and disabled. The Gregorian calendar, by its moment of The Solution of the Law of Time. 107"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"historicity, bound that crippled time disorder into its final institutional form, assur- ing that not only European man, but eventually all cultures and races dominated by European thought and conventions would assume and accept this deformed and deforming standard of time. The mechanical clock, though evolved over many centuries, was perfected just after the Gregorian Calendar Reform of 1582 and promoted by Europeans as an example of the human triumph over nature. So it was that the human mind assumed as second nature its own invented time, encoded as a frequency that we have identi- fied as the 12 :60, an unconscious mental ratio determined by the irregular twelve- month calendar and artificial sixty-minute hour. The combination of these two fac- tors in this one timing frequency have consigned historical man to a hopelessly de- bilitating mental disorder that is referred to as modern civilization, or nowadays, postmodern. But postmodern is not yet post-historical. Postmodernism is just the final convulsion of the time disorder that afflicts the human race as a virulent mental disease and encapsulates man in the technospheric cocoon of his own making. The only cure for such a profound and pervasive disorder is absolute harmony, the very harmony from which historical man so recoils. In this light, it is well to know that through the first half of the twentieth century a vigorous and well-organized calendar reform movement flourished. Such was the character of this movement to reform the Gregorian calendar that in 1923 the League of Nations called for proposals for reform. More than 500 proposals were received; by 1931, these were narrowed to three: The International Calendar Organization, represented by Mr. Broughton Richmond, promoted a perpetual calendar based on the principle of five- five 73-day cycles = 365 days-and the year divided into twelve months of five 6-day weeks each plus a 5-day cycle [The Thirteen Moon calendar also includes the program of seventy-three 5-day periods-overtone chromat- ics-integrated with the fifty-two 7-day weeks: 52 x 7(+1) = 5 x 73.] The International Fixed Calendar League, represented by Mr. Moses Cotsworth, also supported by Eastman Kodak and the International Cham- ber of Commerce, promoted a perpetual Thirteen Month/28-day calendar, which was first presented by Auguste Comte (1842-1849), inclusive of the \"day out of time.\" Though it was not backed by a more thorough math- ematical science, which has now been supplied by the discovery of the Law of Time, this was by far the favored calendar, as it is the one that possesses a perfect structural harmony and obvious regularity of all its parts.

This group turned out to be the longest-lived and the most vocal, and was responsible for the publication of The Journal Of Calendar Reform (1931-32).4 It is instructive to read some of the early texts on the topic of calendar reform to see how the same issue of harmony and order brought up by the Law of Time was at the root of the call for the establishment of a perpetual, harmonic calendar. The base argument, as presented in Alexander Philip's The Reform of the Calendar (1914), is stated as follows: Suppose, for example, that by some strange convention the meaning of the figures we employ in numerical notation were to change every year; suppose the figure which this year represents 2 were next year to mean 3, next year 4, and so on; sup- pose again that our weights and measures were to fluctuate in a similar manner. . . then we affirm, without fear of contradiction, that the whole fabric of science and the mechanical arts could never have been raised at all. . . we should in such circum- stances have been compelled to rest content today with the very simplest and most primitive appliances. Yet, strange as it may sound, such are the conditions under which, in modem society, human action is organized. For what is the framework. . . by which we arrange our actions? It is no other than the scheme under which we arrange our time-in one word, our calendar. . . [thus] the disorganized state of all social arrangements is ascribable to the calendar. . . The dislocation of our calendrical arrangements is due to two distinct causes. . . the incongruity of the week; [and] the irregularity of the lengths of the months. . .5 The argument made is a profound one, and was the motivating basis of the cal- endar reform movement in general, no matter which calendar was being promoted. It is fair to ask: Why do we expect a rigorous standard of uniformity in our measure- ments of space (size, weight, volume, etc.), but spurn or ignore the same require- ment of uniformity in our measurement of time, especially the time that governs our everyday social arrangements and consciousness? How can we think that this would not have a profound underlying effect on the very nature and conduct of our society? Most interestingly, as a movement calendar reform arose strongly during the proto-technosphere, between the two World Wars, only to be swept away by the clouds of war and the contradictory factions of disharmony in which modern The Solution of the Law of Time. 109 3."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"civilization was already immersed. Any effort at altering or changing the direction and motion of modern civilization is treated as a threat or derided as ineffectual activity that is scientifically unprovable or that will cost humanity too many dollars to make the change. Such was the fate of the first great calendar reform movement that arose with such fervor in the late nineteenth century only to find its ignomini- ous end when the final debate on calendar reform was adjourned indefinitely by the United Nations Social and Economics Committee in 1956. No one reads about the calendar reform movement in the history books. Because debate on the matter was effectively adjourned, it is assumed that calendar reform is a dead issue of no rel- evance to the development of postatomic, technospheric man. On the contrary, seen in the dim light of the still-smoking ruin of the Twin Towers, the calendar reform arguments concerning humanity's irrational behavior and its relation to the \"immo- rality\" of a skewed timing measure, the calendar, as well as to an inhuman timing device, the clock, were never more relevant. Not the least import of calendar reform is the opportunity to create a new basis for unifying humanity. As was stated in the \"Resolution Adopted by the Fourth Gen- eral Conference on Communications and Transit of the League of Nations,\" which took up the issue of calendar reform: \"A great number of delegations expressed the opinion that any reform of the calendar could only be put into practice if it came into force simultaneously throughout the world, or at least in a very great majority of States, and it was for this reason that the study of this question had been placed under the auspices of the League of Nations.\"6 The tragedy of the human inability to agree on a matter so obvious to logic and reason is a testament to the already crippling effects of having operated so long under parochial, sectarian, and often disharmonic timing standards. While the In- ternational Chamber of Commerce, the League of Nations, and various interna- tional scientific bodies supported the first effort at reform in 1914-1956, the second movement, 1989-present, arose as a purely populist effort, but with an entirely dif- ferent information base. Recognizing instinctively that the calendar reform issue is more than merely a matter of mathematical order in relation to natural cycles, it is a profoundly theological issue as well, the second reform movement also developed from a non-Western inspiration: the Mayan calendar. While the psychology of the dominator civilization all but blurs out any other considerations of calendar besides the prevailing Gregorian one, an objective study of the matter demonstrates that the latter is a primitive instrument that eschews both natural cyclic order and any mathematical harmony.

This book was published with scarcely any knowledge of the calendar reform movement that had gone into a debilitating coma in 1956. Yet, by pursuing the mathematical base of the Mayan calendar, the essence of the Mayan achievement, the Law of Time was ex- tracted, a discovery that brought on the second calendar reform movement, the World Thirteen Moon Calendar Change Peace Movement. Prompted by a prophetic rev- elation concerning the Thirteen Moon!28-Day calendar decoded from the tomb of Pacal Votan, the premise of the second calendar reform movement was tested world- wide from 1993 to 2000, a time defined as the \"seven years of prophecy.\" By the year 2001, the official beginning of the third Christian millennium, a loose, far-flung calendar reform movement, pioneering in the development of a new science of time and consciousness was promoting the Thirteen Moon!28-Day calendar worldwide. A REVOLUTION IN TIME \"Fire in the lake, the image of revolution. Thus, the superior person sets the calendar in order and makes the seasons clear\" -I CHING, HEXAGRAM 49, \"REVOLUTION\"8 By common consent, a calendar is a system for reckoning time. Virtually all current time-reckoning systems take account only of chronological or, better put, astro- nomical time-the movement of the Earth in relation to celestial bodies, the sun, moon, planets, stars, and constellations. This is a purely third-dimensional, physical consideration of time. The Law of Time affirms a higher order of time-the synchronic order. This is the time of the fourth dimension, which includes the chronological but enfolds it in a higher mental and mathematical order of reality. According to the Law of Time, what you don't know about the calendar you are using could kill you. By operating according to purely third-dimensional chrono- I I 2 .

To correct this situation a radical solution is required-a new calendar embedded in the synchronic order revealed by the discovery of the Law of Time. This is the significance of the Thirteen Moon/2 8- Day calendar-it epitomizes the incorporation of the chrono-astronomical order of time into the synchronic order, and hence pro- vides the vehicle for humanity to escape its otherwise certain plunge into disaster within the next decade. When a dogma is encountered while one is engaged in the pursuit of truth, it must be challenged and abolished. Such a dogma is the calendar in use as the world standard, the Gregorian calendar. That this calendar, originally a system of thought peculiar to one people or religion, should dominate all the peoples and even life of the planet makes it subject to the critique of planetary anthropology. The discovery that time is a frequency mathematically expressed as the ratio 13:20 requires a profound reorganization of all thought about time and the conse- quent reorganization of human society as a planetary organism. As the unified field theory of time, the Law of Time calls for the human synchronization in time predi- cated on the establishment of the Thirteen Moon calendar as the global civil stan- dard replacing the current erroneous timing standard, the Gregorian calendar. This is a matter of the utmost seriousness, since it is also recognized that all belief systems are the function of programs locked up or embedded in the calendars or time-reck- oning systems used by a people. The fate of the species and the biosphere may well depend on whether or not humanity is able to understand this point. What is it about the calendars in use that condemns their users to endless con- flict and inability to unify as a species? What is at the root of their disharmony? It is the pursuit of astronomical time. All people today are bound by calendars based on a pursuit of accuracy of astronomical time-the length of the year being the object of this pursuit. Astronomical time is a losing game of an ever-changing and elusive order that results in an entropic reductionism that has little to do with consciousness or synchronization. The year's length (measure of the orbit of the Earth around the sun) calculated by Pope Gregory XIII at 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 20 seconds, slows at the rate of 112 second per century, while the length of time in the Gregorian calendar is off from the \"true\" solar year by 25.9678 seconds per year! Obsessed with rectifying this discrepancy, in 1972 reductionist science came up with Atomic Time to replace Earth Time, and the atomic cesium clock replaced the measure of the year as 365.241299 days with 290,091,200,500,000,000 oscillations of Cs per year!

In profound contrast to this obsessive reductionism in which there is no place for spirit, mind, or consciousness, fourth-dimensional radial mathematics represents a mental order greater than and encompassing the astronomical order of the third- dimensional universe. According to the Law of Time, in time reckoning, consider- ation should be given to systems of the harmonic order of synchronic time that proceed from the radial mathematical order of the higher mind. The higher mind represents the evolved state of mind-the noosphere-that evolution on Earth tends toward, but that has not yet been attained. As long as the human concept of time is governed by the obsessive pursuit of the impossible to attain perfection of astro- nomical time, this pursuit and the civilization that it propels are doomed to failure. What is known as history is embedded in this pursuit of \"fixing\" astronomical time, which has culminated in the dogma of the Gregorian calendar and the microatomic measure of the cesium clock. When did this pursuit begin, why did it come to domi- nate the human species, and to what effect? As we have seen, the values, customs, and norms of a nation, culture, or civiliza- tion are embedded in the calendar it uses. The Gregorian calendar, the current glo- bal civil standard-indeed, the foundation in time of globalization-is the calendar of the Caesars, of the Roman Empire, of the Catholic Church and the Vatican. To change this calendar is to change history itself. Can it be done? The League ofNa- tions attempted this in the 1930s but failed. The United Nations tabled this effort in 1956. Since the United Nations adjourned the matter of calendar reform indefi- nitely, in 45 years the Earth's population has more than doubled, that is, it has in- creased by more than 3.2 billion people, a factor that is still out of control, and that may have much to do with the fact that humanity is actually in a fog about time. The reasons for wanting to replace the Gregorian calendar are no less valid today. The Gregorian calendar is not a standard of measure. It lacks logic and rea- son. It numbs and befuddles the mind when trying to make calculations by it. It is shrouded in an arcane and medieval obscurantism. The net effect of the use of this calendar is to perpetuate a fundamental level of mental confusion and ignorance concerning the actual nature of time itself-an ignorance that is hardened into dogma by the unwillingness of habit to consider any other possibility, but rather to accept the entire system as second nature. The argument that it encodes the most accurate and scientific measure of the solar orbit of the Earth is irrelevant in relation to the effect of its irregular measure on the mind and its numbing power as the dogma of a conquering people. Indeed, the solar measure of365.241299 days per year has noth- ing intrinsically to do with \"30 days hath September. . . ,\" and vice versa. In fact, the 114 . TheSolution of the Law of Time"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"measure of the Earth's orbit is one matter; the purpose of calendars and time reckon- ing as factors of synchronization is a wholly other matter. But then, since the very nature of a culture or a civilization is determined by the calendar it keeps, the use of a deformed standard can only inhibit and skew even the questions one asks about time. The failure of calendar reform by 1961, the year of the Vatican II Council, only promoted an increasingly complacent acceptance, however cleverly disguised, of a millennial dogma, the Gregorian calendar. In the conclusion to the \"last word\" on the subject, Calendar: Humanity's Epic Struggle to Determine a True and Accurate Year, David Duncan summarizes, \"We take in stride a calendar [the Gregorian] that is flawed but endures, largely because it works just fine for most of us, and it is what we are used to.\"9 It is not at all objective to accept something because we are used to it. This attitude is anything but scientific. Rather, it is the smug basis of nothing more than a self-fulfilling dogma-and yet the civilization that bases itself on this aberrant timing measure prides itself as being the most scientific in all history! THE CONFUSION OF IRREGULAR TIME Due to this flawed time sensibility, it may be concluded that humankind today is little capable of moral reason or logic, which itself is a result of, or at least strongly reinforced by, habituation to a timing standard that is irrational and illogical. Any- time we overlook or dismiss a fault due to habit, or simply because we are accus- tomed to the use, say, of an instrument, even if that instrument is demonstrated to be flawed and irregular, is evidence of a moral laziness that will eventually contaminate the entire consciousness that accepts and accommodates itself to the flaw. The exer- cise of truth is a moral prerogative. The fact of the matter is that the Gregorian calendar is a hodgepodge of flaws and accretions, rationalized into a systematic for- mulization that has no basis in reality. The celebration of Easter is a case in point. Easter is the celebration of the day Christ was resurrected from the dead. It may be logically assumed that this occurred on one and only one particular day, just as the celebration of his birth occurs on Christmas Day (although, similarly, no one really knows that this was the actual date of his birth). By the time the Christian religion had become an established force within the Roman Empire, however, no one knew precisely on what day the Resurrection had taken place. The Council of Nicea, convened by Constantine in A.D. 325, called for a debate on the matter in which various theories were presented. The debate was concluded with the victory of one conjectural system over the other. The winning system stated that Easter The Solution of the Law of Time. 1 15"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"would be celebrated on the first Sunday after the first full moon after the spring equinox, except when the full moon was on a Sunday, in which case it would be celebrated on the following Sunday, and this was so that it would not be celebrated on the same day as Jewish Passover. Over the centuries this conjectural theory regarding the date of Christ's resur- rection was buttressed with a system of elaborate calculations for predicting when Easter would occur. These calculations were all made with regard to establishing an alignment of the synodic lunar cycle of29.5306 days (which resulted in a lunar year of 354.3672 days) and the solar year of 365.241299 days! Being fortified with such elaborate mathematical calculations did not lessen the fact that the system was origi- nally-and still is-a mere speculation of a highly clever but relative nature. Thor- oughly embedded in the Julian-Gregorian calendar, the system of determining Eas- ter is inseparable from the Gregorian calendar itself, and is one of the chief reasons for the resistance to its reform-as witnessed by a reading of the calendar reform arguments of the 1930s. The entire system of this calendar, inherited without ques- tion from the Caesars of the Roman empire, is actually nothing more than a form of self-perpetuation of a priestly hierarchy that includes in its support a host of bank- ers, industrialists, and scientists and the elaborate social system that is under their control-the technosphere of global civilization itself. Take away the calendar and the entire structure loses its foundation. \"If the Julian/Gregorian calendar was to be offered as a new device for measur- ing time, we, with our present knowledge and state ofliving, would reject it as some- thing utterly impracticable, lacking in harmony and order, unbalanced and irregular, too clumsy a calendar to make calculations by, while the various sections are not comparable.\"10 A science or any scientist that unquestioningly follows the Gregorian calendar is, in reality, not worthy of the name. What is science? A concern for logic and precision of measure, we might answer, as well as standards of measure that utilize uniform units of measure in accord with what is being measured. Yes, the year is calculated as being 365.241299 days in length, but if the annual standard of measure that is used is irregular and unscientific, then it avails nothing, and indeed deforms the mind leading it down byways that may only end in self-destruction. Thus the pursuit of a true and accurate year in itself may be an illusory pursuit, blinding us to the actual nature of time, and leading us away from a genuine understanding of ourselves and our role and purpose on this Earth. To change and replace the calendar with the thirteen moon standard is to return us to our original purpose, leading us back to pathways of harmony and natural I 1 6 .

According to the Law of Time, the damage already inflicted in the time humanity last hesitated and lost the chance to alter its timing frequency, forty years ago, has been incalculable. The final opportunity to change the calendar and the timing frequency is now upon us. Because of this we must be very clear and unshak- able in our understanding and determination to expose and eliminate the current civil calendar for once and for all. Even apologist David Duncan's unabashedly pro- Gregorian book Calendar (1999) concludes with its time line on the date 2012, \"Cur- rent Mayan Great Cycle will end.\"ll But will we also end? By 2012, it will be too late to change. We must begin to change now. In reviewing the quirks and twists of history that constitute the Gregorian calen- dar, we must ask: Why do we continue to use such an instrument, and what are its effects? Is a calendar something more than a tool for scheduling the payment of debts (calends), or is it an instrument of synchronization? The harmony or dishar- mony of time is a profound matter rooted in the instrument of time reckoning that we use. There can be little question that we live more in a time of chaos than of harmony. We may also say in regard to the effect of standards of measure on the mind, that the chaos of the time is embedded in the calendar we use. If we are to leave this time of chaos and enter a time of harmony, then we must exchange the instrument in which the chaos is embedded for an instrument that is the very model of harmony-the Thirteen Moon/2 8- Day count. This is the choice humankind must now make. The issue of the nature of time, or of the times in which we are living, cannot be separated from the issue of the calendar. The very nature of the calendar that the world follows has stunted the mind and warped the body's innate timing sensibility, reducing the understanding of time to being merely a matter of chronology. \"Chro- nology is a register or reckoning of successive years, a time scale. It may also be described as a system of registering time massively.\"12 Virtually all time reckoning has proceeded from astronomical indicators, the major exception being the Maya, who actuated from a solely mathematical outlook. Yet with this mathematical out- look the Maya devised a chronological method that has never been surpassed, a fact attested to by many, including the architects of the Kitt Peak Observatory in Tuc- son, Arizona, where a mosaic mural depicting the civilization of the Maya asserts the superiority of their calendar over that of the Europeans. It is significant that the earlier calendar reform movement, while occasionally acknowledging the brilliance of the Maya, made no use of the Mayan knowledge. But this was because the time sensibility was restricted to thinking of time solely in terms of chronology, or at best as a schedule for keeping good accounts, with little The Solution of the Law of Time. I I 7"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"comprehension at all of the synchronic nature or order of time. And since the system of chronology was synonymous with the system of control embedded in the Gregorian calendar system, the earlier reform movement failed altogether to make any impact on the Vatican, much less on the global power structure itself. All the thought, action, and good intention put into the years of calendar reform notwithstanding, the Gregorian calendar prevailed, and, tragically, not one of the proposals or recommendations was ever even considered for adoption by the papal authorities who maintain control over the calendar. In the 1930s, the propaganda of the Church was aimed at limiting any possibility of reform, for it would not give up the succession of the seven-day week. In any perpetual calendar, such as the Thir- teen Moon/2 8- Day calendar, the observance of the Day Out of Time is necessary for maintaining the harmony of the fifty-two weeks that complete themselves in 364 days. The continuous succession of the week does not stand in a constant relation with the other elements of the calendar and is one of the main causes of confusion in the Gregorian calendar. Arguing that such a break as a Day Out of Time, no day of the week at all, would plunge the world more deeply into chaos, barbarism, and war, the Vatican effectively blocked all effort at reform. The completion of the century of total war, capped by the Inevitable Event, roundly refutes this point. It may just as easily be argued that because we did not change the calendar, we are now plunged into the final barbarism and unholy war. When the Vatican II Council in 1961 affirmed in its backward and highly re- strictive language that it was not opposed to reform, so long as such reform did not disrupt the seven-day week and respected the tradition of Easter as a \"movable feast,\" the door to reform slammed shut. By this time all the early reformists had literally died out and the question of calendar reform appeared to have become one of the buried issues of history. What the priests of the Catholic Church thought they had buried through an auto-da-fe in Izamal, Yucatan, 1562, and overcome through the imposition of the Julian-Gregorian calendar over the conquered Maya, returned with the precision of prophetic timing in 1987. The publication of The Mayan Factor not only opened the door to a new look at the Maya, but also to an understanding of time that was anything but chronological. A new dimension of time appeared-radial, fractal time, the synchronic order. And behind the reassessment of the nature of time was the provocative call of Mayan prophecy-the end of the thirteen baktun Long Count, 2012.

With the analysis of the Law of Time, there is an even greater urgency and a more profound certainty. Reform is not only insufficient but also impossible. If the calen- dar is not changed within the next decade, it will be the end of civilization as we know it. There is a genuine and legitimate need to bring the issue of calendar reform into the public eye once again. Yes, to change the calendar involves a frequency shift. The collapse of the technosphere will dispose the human mind to rethink its options. It may even reori- ent the human mind to a consideration of the biosphere as being the greater vehicle in which we, as humans, are being carried. Such a massive change in attitude, a mind shift and a paradigm shift, may arouse in the human breast a spiritual reawakening as well. Harmony is spirituality. By changing the calendar, humanity can know it has turned a page of destiny-an act that may cause it to appreciate what has already been written in a book it had not been inclined to study, the Holy Quran: God is the One who raised the heavens without pillars that you can see, then as- sumed all authority. He committed the sun and the moon, each running in its orbit for a predetermined period. He controls all things, and explains the revelations that you may attain certainty about meeting your Lord. He is the One who constructed the earth and placed on it mountains and rivers. And from the different kinds of fruits, He made them into pairs-males and females. The night overtakes the day. These are solid proofs for people who think. (13:2-3) In this passage we can find ample evidence of the formal order of the Law of Time and the biosphere-solid proofs.

The difference between the new time and the old time is literally like the difference between Heaven and Hell. September 11, 2001: the Twin Towers collapse, creating a rupture in the technosphere. Everything comes to a halt. The New York Stock Exchange is closed for four days-a virtually unprecedented event. All commercial airline traffic in America is halted for two days. Even the United Nations postpones the opening of its fifty-sixth General Assembly by three weeks. Six weeks after September 11 a new, sinister form of war is engulfing the technosphere. The Americans assert the right to mercilessly bomb Mghanistan in self-defense. The response of war is the final self-destructive impulse of the techno sphere to protect itself, but this will only widen the effects of the suicidal blow it has already sustained. The war will only make definite that it is the last climax of the biogeochemical combustion engendered by the pursuit of an error in time. The rupture in the technosphere is the break in artificial time, and therefore amounts to the opening of a noospheric fissure-an inrush of cosmic consciousness and a moment of simultaneously heightened natural time. When the towers col- lapsed, belief systems shattered. Because it was viewed on global television, it was an event witnessed by all humanity and it entered through the optical cortex into the brain, arousing potent images from the subconscious. This is a noospheric act be- cause it is the entire mind of the whole species that receives this single image in one simultaneous moment. In that shattering image, however unconscious, the noosphere immediately entered the field of human consciousness, much as a leak in a boat allows water to come rushing in. From the perspective of the noosphere, the technosphere is a medium of transformation resulting from the pursuit of a dis- torted perception of time. With the destruction of the Twin Towers, the transforma- tion is complete; following the war, the technosphere can be creatively dismantled. THE NOOSPHERE: RAINBOW BRAIN OF TIMESHIP EARTH What is the noosphere? Can we define the noosphere more precisely so that it is a less nebulous term? Can we make the noosphere concrete enough so that it may be understood and accepted as the coming new way of a higher level of everyday nor- malcy? First of all, let us say that the noosphere has existed as long as life has existed on this Earth. In this sense, the noosphere is the sum of the mental interactions of all life. The mental interactions, or field of mind, exist as a great unconscious medium, I 22 . Humans-Noospheric Chips"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"inseparable from the Law of Time. That is, if all life and the phenomenal world of the biospheric medium are synchronized by the Law of Time, then the programs of the organization oflife, from the periodic tables to the DNA code, will also be syn- chronized by and embedded in the mathematics of the Law of Time. Being a func- tion of the whole system of the Earth and integral to the functioning of the bio- sphere as an interplay of cycles in which organic and inorganic interact with a set order of chemical transmutations, the noosphere must also be the mental coordinat- ing field or program of this complex of vital interactions. It must, therefore, be a characteristic of biospheric evolution that the noosphere remains unconscious until a significant moment is reached-the climax of the cycle of biogeochemical com- bustion, the enactment of the biosphere-noosphere transition. As the Earth's mental field, it must be an act of collective self-reflection that arouses the noosphere into functioning consciousness. By its definition as the mental envelope of the Earth, the noosphere can come into conscious manifestation only through an act of collective self-reflection, such as the proposed calendar change. Also, as the mental envelope of the Earth that is above and discontinuous with the biosphere, the noosphere-mind sphere--can mean only one thing: the advent of universal telepathy among the humans. The Internet can be seen as a third-dimensional reflection of the noosphere, a form of electronic proto-telepathy. But, ironically, as long as the humans hold on to the Internet, they cannot experience the true evolutionary potential of genuine universal telepathy. The point is that telepathy can only function in a field of reality that is synchronized by the natural 13 :20 timing frequency. Time and telepathy are mutually defining factors dependent on unity of thought. The humans have cho- sen a path of disunity, so that their calendar programs clash and are at odds with each other and with natural time. This maintains the technosphere, destroys the biosphere, and keeps the noosphere in the unconscious. But now, with the Inevitable Event, the break has occurred and the shattering of the Dreamspell of History has begun. The noosphere's rainbow brain leaks back into human consciousness. The rainbow brain of the noosphere-what is that? As the mental envelope of the Earth, the noosphere possesses a structure ordained by the Law of Time and congruent with the structure of the whole Earth. Within the noosphere are to be found the evolutionary control panel or programs, defined as the psi bank-the me- dium of information storage and retrieval for all the mental programs. The noosphere is the field of planetary consciousness in which humans are intended to participate and complete their evolution. However, operating by artificial time is like looking through a glass darkly. This being so, there is no noosphere to see. Humans gener- ally experience consciousness through the chinks in their sensory prism, conditioned Humans-Noospheric Chips. I 23"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"by separatist beliefs, making it most difficult to attain a perception or experience the field of consciousness as coextensive with the Earth. Indeed, if the biosphere is the region on Earth for the transformation of cosmic energies, the noosphere is that re- gion of the Earth for the reflection of cosmic consciousness and its mental programs. Seen through the lens of universal synchronized time, the humans accommodating to a single instrument of time measurement are inherently sharing a single thought form. It is that act of self-reflective convergence that makes the noosphere conscious and draws it toward the resplendent omega point of2012 and beyond. As with all the other geochemical structures and processes of the Earth that are planetary in nature, the noosphere, the rainbow brain of Earth, actually has a coher- ence and an order that we may define in a precise way. In so doing we shall redefine the nature of human reality and the human being itself. We must enlarge our lens of perception to encompass the whole Earth as a single being. In relation to this single being of the Earth, the individual human is hardly even a speck. The dimensions and proportions by which we commonly measure reality must also expand to accommo- date the vast dimensions of the Earth as a single entity, a planetary geocosm within the solar field, the heliosphere. Since the sun is also a star, the heliosphere is a function and member of the galactic order of being. As the mental \"thinking sphere\" of this planetary being, Earth, the noosphere is above and discontinuous with the biosphere, the hydro- sphere, and the atmosphere. It is contained by and functions within the vast invisible electromagnetic field of the Earth. Though the ionosphere is the lowest level of the electromagnetic field system of the Earth, the main structures of this field are the two radiation belts located 2,000 and 11,000 miles above the Earth. It is within the two radiation belts that the control panels of the noosphere are to be found-the psi bank. KIN: BIPOLAR BASE MEASURE OF THE 13:20 MATRIX ''And He is the One who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon; each floating in its own orbit. \" -QuRAN,21:33 In the simplest aspect of our daily experience of time on Earth we have the full play of the law of alternation-day-night, sun-moon, north-south. Because we know the bi- polar nature of the Earth, dividing it into two geomagnetic fields, north polar and south polar, we can then define the complementary bipolar field of time, which divides the cycle of the Earth as it makes one rotation on its axis into one day and night. This 12 4 . . Humans-Noospheric Chips"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"entire unit, day and night, is defined as a kin, the base unit of synchronic time measure- ment. From the perspective of the noosphere, day and night are a function of the two alternators-day alternator and night alternator-that operate as the phasic motion of the rainbow brain of the noosphere working in tandem with the electromagnetic field. The two phasic alternators regulate the activation of photons (day) and the regenera- tion of photons (night) within the entirety of the life process of the biosphere. THE NOOSPHERIC FOURFOLD/EIGHT-PART STRUCTURE \"He created the heavens and the earth truth- fully. He rolls the night over the day and the day over the night.

We made the night dark and the day lighted, that you may seek provisions from your Lord therein. This also establishes for you a timing system, and the means of calcula- tion. We thus explain everything in detail. \" -17:12 Since the two alternators are also in interplay with the bipolar magnetic fields of the Earth, a four-part process is revealed that is magnetically distributed as an overall eight-part structure. The unit of one kin divides the rotational cycle of the Earth in its orbit into four distinct phases daily and annually. The four daily points are de- fined by: the dawn, when the part of Earth you are in first experiences the solar photonic activation; the high noon (zenith), when the part of Earth you are in is in closest direct relation to the sun; the twilight, when the photonic activation ceases and the sun disappears from view; and midnight (nadir), the point at which the point of Earth you are on has rotated to its farthest distance from the sun, the height of the cycle of photonic regeneration. This daily process is mimicked in the four points of equinox and solstice, where for either hemisphere the equinoxes are the same as the points of dawn and twilight and the solstices correspond either to high noon or to midnight. Because of the magnetic polarity of the Earth, the four-part process is Humans-Noospheric Chips.

The psi bank plates, the \"nervous system\" and control panel of the noosphere, are a complete function of the 13 :20 timing frequency and thus participate in the systematic regularity of the fourth- dimensional synchronic order. This means that the psi bank is the registration within the Earth's magnetic field of the 13 :20 timing matrix by which all life and the planetary evolutionary process as a whole are regulated. Simulating the four-part process of the Earth rotating on its axis in time, four stages per day, four seasons per year, in four-year cycles-not to mention the four phases of the moon-four psi bank plates accommo- dating the bipolar field yield eight 260-unit 13:20 frequency information matrices.

Each plate is divided by mirror symmetry into a 260- unit Northern and a 260-unit Southern hemispheric half, for a total of two bipolar matrices and 520 units per plate, or 2,080 (520 x 4) units in all. These units are referred to as psi chrono units or time-bearing information units. The information for the different sequences of the Earth's biogeochemical evolutionary processes is all regulated by these time-bearing information units. We have to understand that through the medium of universal cosmic time the Earth, the Sun, and every star, constellation, and galaxy is coordinated in this way by the synchronic 13:20 frequency of time. It is the 13:20 frequency that establishes holon- omic consistency in time throughout the universe. The Earth's noosphere is a lens of time. All cosmic information is focused through this lens. It is this noospheric lens of time that makes Earth into a geocosmic thought form. The noospheric lens of time and mind has been operating ceaselessly-but un- consciously-since the beginning of the evolution of the Earth. Since the noosphere is a function of the universal synchronic timing frequency, its conscious activation must also come about through a superior mental coordination with this correct syn- chronizing timing frequency. The psi bank 13:20 frequency is consciously activated and registered at the human level by the mental engagement of the 13 :20 matrix as enacted through the 260-day cycle. The interaction of the 260-day galactic cycle with the 365-day solar biotelepathic cycle defines one noospheric year, or one solar- galactic cycle of fifty-two human years (= fifty-two 365-day solar orbits = seventy- three 260-day galactic cycles). This great noospheric coordination of fifty-two solar orbits with seventy-three galactic cycles is fractally present in a single solar orbit, where fifty-two 7 -day weeks = seventy-three 5-day cycles known as chromatics. What is important in coming to understand the noosphere as Earth's geocosmic time lens and rainbow brain, is that we must change our perspective altogether from anthro- pocentric to noospherocentric, and in this way evolve into Homo noosphericus. THE CYCLES OF NET TIME For the noosphere, the rainbow brain of planet Earth, time is different-it is slower and longer. From the noosphere's point of view, what we call a year is a solar orbit. What we call a day is a single rotation of the Earth on its axis. The cycles of the moon are the lunar phasings that calibrate the synchronization of the Earth in time. The Earth is not a spaceship. The Earth is a Timeship. As a Timeship, the Earth is a function of the master synchronization frequency that coordinates and moves it in I 28 .

Seen through the noospheric lens of time, the technosphere is a highly exaggerated accel- eration of the biogeochemical continuum through highly artificial and resource- depleting means-it is but a smoking bubble whose fragile struts and frets are laced together by transport and communication systems that yield a cacophony rather than a harmony. And for this reason, the disharmony of the bubble ultimately ex- plodes upon itself, releasing Earth from the prison of false time into the fresh air of real time and the advance into the geocosmic splendor of the noosphere. Synchro- nized with the galactic cycles, the noospheric mind of the whole Earth is reckoned far differently from the artificial units of measure that condition the anthropocentric notions of time evolved in the era of Homo historicus. Here is how the fourfold process of Earth in time is reckoned by the noosphere. Please note that in Noospheric Earth Time (NET), time is universal synchroniza- tion. At any given moment, it is always the same noospheric moment in time on Table of Noospheric Earth Time Units 1. One Noospheric Earth minute = 1 day-and-night rotation of Earth on its axis = 1 kin. 2.

Humans-Noospheric Chips. I 29"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Earth. Whether that moment is experienced on the night or day side of the Earth, that moment is simultaneous and encompasses both sides of the Earth at once. This is true not only because time is the factor of synchronization- T(E) = Art, where art is the result of any synchronization-but also because the velocity of time is infi- nitely instantaneous. By thinking that the Earth really does conform to the 24 hours of the clock, the humans have retarded their time sensibility, and consequently their artificial processes have become increasingly artless. In considering the N oospheric Time measurements, remember that as a human you are but a cell in the biospheric organism-or, as we shall see, a chip of the noospheric rainbow brain. As the measure of the mind of the Earth, the N oospheric Earth Time (NET) reckoning units coordinate consciousness as a planetary, or, more accurately, a solar- planetary phenomenon. For instance, if one NET day is a single 365-day solar orbit of the Earth, dawn of the noospheric Earth day is experienced as the spring equinox, but the noosphere is bipolar. So the dawn is also simultaneously the autumn equinox or twilight of the other polar magnetic half of the Earth. To fully engage and grasp such a thought is to expand the limits of consciousness. Like dolphins who never sleep but only rest half of their brain at a time, so it is with the rainbow brain of the noosphere. Such consciousness has nothing to do with the workings of the everyday egoistic human consciousness, which can understand things only according to a lim- ited frame of reference defined by its own limited and highly conditioned ego needs. The geocosmic consciousness of the noosphere can be apprehended only as a single telepathic unity in and by which all members of any given species or organism are organized. To consider that the noosphere itself could become the organizing prin- ciple of the human species as a whole is to engage in conscious mental evolution. Small aboriginal prehistoric bands of humans experience an unconscious level of this geocosmic noospheric mind. Dolphins, other mammals, and all animal species experience this noospheric mind. Even trees and crystals are organized by this noospheric mind of time. Homo historicus, however, slowly but inexorably cut himself off from the noospheric mind of time by substituting erroneous instruments of measure, or instruments of measure that were incomplete in relation to the noospheric time cycles. The result was the exponential surge in biogeochemical combustion that characterized the final baktun cycle, culminating in the fifty-six-year blister of artificial time, the techno- sphere. The fact that the time blister popped eleven years before the end of the cycle of Homo historicus, 2012, means that Homo noosphericus is ready to emerge from the shattered cocoon of false time.

ELECTROMAGNETIC WORKINGS OF THE EARTH'S RAINBOW BRAIN What we call the cycles of time are the thought moments of the Earth. These thought moments coordinate the complex orders of Timeship Earth, understood as a whole system. Because the operating mechanism of the noosphere that governs the Earth's cyclic thought moments is inseparable from the general structure and functions of the electromagnetic field in which it is located, we may refer to a rainbow brain of the noosphere. Why is this so? Let us return to the structure of the noosphere, Earth's mind in time. Consisting of the four bipolar psi bank plates, these four synchronic time plates are located between the two radiation belts, that is to say between 11,000 and 2,000 miles above the biospheric surface of the Earth. With the location of its information time-bearing mechanism between the radiation belts, the noosphere must by necessity operate in tandem with the electromagnetic field as it is regulated by these two master radia- tion belts. What do these belts do? They emanate Earth's electromagnetic aura, and function as a protective shield around the Earth. They do this by trapping solar- cosmic radiation, keeping much of it from hitting the biosphere directly, channeling it instead through the Earth's magnetic poles into the Earth's core. In the polar regions excess cosmic radiation, including electrically charged plas- mas and solar discharges from coronal mass ejections, is released into the atmo- sphere as the auroras-aurora borealis (or northern lights) in the North, and aurora australis (or southern lights) in the South. The increased solar activity during the most recent and current sunspot cycles has enhanced and extended the auroral activ- ity in recent years far beyond the polar zones. In addition, since 1987 great influxes of plasma into the solar system have intensified the incidence of spectral plasmic activity within the atmosphere itself. This amounts to an increase in rainbows, halos around the sun, and brilliantly colored clouds. While these phenomena may be ex- plained to a certain degree as meteorological effects (the angle of the sun's rays, moisture in the atmosphere, and so on), is there more to a rainbow than meteoro- logical side effects? And what relation is there between the noosphere, the electro- magnetic field, and the increased plasmic-rainbow activity? Again, seen from the perspective of whole Earth, the rainbows and spectral plas- I 32 . Humans-Noospheric Chips"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"mic effects, including the auroras, are the free energy released by the noosphere. Rainbows are to the noosphere what toxic waste is to the technosphere. The noosphere itself implies a mental field that is interacting with the electromagnetic field. The Earth's electromagnetic field is actually the strongest of all the planets in the solar system. The only other planet that has a field approaching the strength of the Earth's field is Uranus. If the Earth's electromagnetic field is the strongest, is this an indication of the strength of the noosphere as well? If the rainbows, auroras, and other spectral plasmic activity are a demonstration of the free energy released due to the interac- tion of the noosphere and electromagnetic fields, and the noosphere is the mental envelope of the planet, inclusive of the as-yet-to-be-unified mind of the human spe- cies, what forms of free energy might be released if the human mental field were operating as a single unity in the correct timing frequency? One other mechanism crucial to the entire system of noosphere and electro- magnetic fields is the crystal core at the center of the Earth. In the 1970s Russian scientists put forth the idea that the Earth is crystalline in nature, an idea that ex- tended Plato's notion of the Earth as a dodecahedron, one of the five \"platonic sol- ids.\" The idea was that the Earth's surface was held together by a field of resonance that corresponds to the crystal resonance of certain geometrical solids. R. Buckminster Fuller also gave play to this notion in his description of \"spaceship earth.\" Then in the 1980s American seismologists confirmed that the core of the Earth is actually a gigantic iron crystal structure in the shape of an octahedron, elongated at its ends, which point to the North and South Poles. From the point of view of fourth-dimensional time, the planet Earth is another manifestation of space as an infinitely locatable point, an orbiting body upon which all the vectoral programs of cosmic time may be unfolded. Understood as a Timeship, the Earth's structure is constructed to facilitate its travel in time on a particular route in space in conformity with its relation to the local star, the sun, to the other planets of the solar system or heliosphere, and in synchronization with the universal timing constant 13 :20, which maintains the Earth in the synchronic order. The role of the magnetic octahedral crystal core is to function as the bipolar oscillator and crystal transducer whose purpose is to maintain the Earth in the synchronic order of the 13:20 timing frequency. Thus, if the Earth's noosphere contains the 13:20 timing programs of the psi bank, and the crystal bipolar oscillator is meant to maintain the Earth's space body in the synchronic order, obviously there is a resonant relation be- tween the crystal core and the noospheric-electromagnetic field programs. The transductive properties of the crystal allow it to transform energy from one state to another. The crystal core also stores electronic plasmas that travel to it from the Humans-Noospheric Chips. I 33"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Earth's poles through an electromagnetic flux tube system. Within the crystalline core, the electronic plasmas are transduced into information. This is the information of time understood as cosmically transmitted thought forms. These plasmic thought forms con- form to programs already established in the psi bank of the noosphere. These are the Earth's thought forms, the cycles of the Earth's brain waves, as it were, that allow it to maintain its biospheric programs and to evolve its mental field, the noosphere. The very descriptions of the Noospheric Earth Time (NET), and of time itself as a synchronous instantaneity inseparabJe from telepathy, are examples of the Earth's thought forms trans- duced through a human biocomputer and then transmitted into a form of human lan- guage for the purpose of communication. Keeping this description of the noospheric brain in mind, let us return to our analysis of the biosphere-noosphere transition. MAKING THE NOOSPHERIC LEAP: TRANSFORMATION OF HUMANS INTO NOOSPHERIC CHIPS The transition to the noosphere is experienced by Earth as a crisis because its systems are stressed. Since the Earth functions as a whole system, stress on one component of the system actually stresses the whole order. Let us review the cumulative stress points. Human 12:60 electromagnetic activity has perturbed and distorted the electromag- netic field. The release of free energy due to geochemical combustion adds to this stressful distortion through the depletion of ozone in the ionosphere and global warm- ing. The radioactivity released into the atmosphere adversely affects the resonant field of the DNA, already driven by the 12:60 frequency to accelerate the multiplication and propagation of the human biomass throughout the biosphere. Through its artifi- cial means, the machine, the human further upsets the inherent balance maintained by the pressure that the species exert upon each other, resulting in mass species extinction. Yet all this is according to an evolutionary program that is intended to bring about an ultimate crisis by which the biosphere snaps into becoming the noosphere. Clearly, if the root of this crisis is the deviation of the dominant species operating according to an artificial timing mechanism at odds with the universal timing fre- quency, then the stabilization of the transition to the noosphere will come about through the dominant species consciously \"returning\" to the correct timing fre- quency. This it can only do by adhering to a macro-organizing program that puts the human species completely in the 13 :20 frequency. If the whole system analysis seeks to locate the flaw in the operation of Times hip Earth, then we must finally declare that this flaw is the human civilization in its entirety, as it is maintained by erroneous and artificial timing constructs.

Only by fully manifesting the noosphere will the Timeship Earth be truly put back on course once again. The noosphere is the program of time on Earth. Time is all that the noosphere has to give us. In consideration that the artifi- cial time of the technosphere has fundamentally run out, the noospheric time should be a welcome gift. Science is always absolutely precise. It is not just calendar reform that is the eye of the needle through which to pass into the noosphere-it is the Thirteen Moon/28- Day calendar calibrated by the 260-day Wizard's Count, synchronized to the Gregorian calendar date, July 26, that provides the exact ticket of admission into the noosphere. And then this ticket must be used at just the right moment-when the show is ready to begin. To use another metaphor, there is a lock on the door to the noosphere, and there is only one key that will fit and unlock this noospheric gate. That key is the Thirteen Moon/28-Day calendar, correlated to July 26 on the Gregorian calendar. It is the precisely applied use of this Thirteen Moon/28-Day calendar that will make each human a noospheric chip of the rainbow brain. This is because the Thirteen Moon/28-Day calendar is the key with the precise design for not only opening but also for continuing to operate the noosphere through a matching of the everyday frequency of time with the frequency of the noospheric control panel, the psi bank. It is because the daily program of the Thirteen Moon/28-Day calendar is em- bedded in the 13:20 frequency that the consciousness of the humans will finally change and rise above the stunted level by which it is currently maintained in the artificial world of the technosphere. Time is of the mind, and the natural time regis- tered by the Thirteen Moon/2 8- Day calendar is the opening to the geocosmic mind of the universe, which adherence to artificial time has kept the human from experi- encing. The noosphere is the fractal lens of this geocosmic mind on Earth. Since the geocosmic mind is purely a function of the Law of Time-energy factored by time equals art, where the 13 :20 synchronizing ratio of time is characterized by infinitely instantaneous velocity-then the fundamental nature of this mind is telepathy. The Thirteen Moon/28-Day calendar is, therefore, the perfectly designed in- strument to make the noospheric leap into telepathy, the planetization of conscious- ness that establishes the daily reality of the noospheric mind. Since the noospheric mind interacts with the electromagnetic field, and because the ratios and cycles of the Thirteen Moon/28-Day calendar conform to the fractals and ratios of the NET, by using this calendar the human becomes transformed into a noospheric chip. The Humans-Noospheric Chips. I 35"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"fractals and ratios of NET become the normative operating cycles of the human in its daily reality. This accounts for an increasing noospheric synchronization that allows the noospheric chip to attain its purpose: generating the Earth's rainbow aura. If the free energy of rainbows is to the noosphere what the free energy of toxic waste is to the technosphere, then the generation of the rainbow implies a type of activity on the part of the human to produce such free energy. To understand what this activity might be and how it works, we must first understand the morphic and holonomic relation between the human noospheric chip-Homo noosphericus-and the structure of the noosphere itself as it is programmed into the geocosmic measure of the Thirteen Moon/28-Day calendar. HUMAN BEINGS AS FRACTAL R EFLECTORS O F THE 13:20 MATRIX From the noospheric perspective, the prototype human is an embodiment of the 13:20 synchronization factor. The human has four limbs. Each of the four extremities has five digits, for a total of twenty fingers and toes that distinguish the human's opera- tional capacity. The four limbs conform to the fourfold phasic operation ofNoospheric Earth Time, while the twenty digits conform to the 20 (4 x 5) factor of the 13:20 ratio. The human also has thirteen main joints or articulations: two ankles, two knees, two hips, two wrists, two elbows, and two shoulders; these six pairs coordinate the four extremities with the body, while the thirteenth articulation, the neck and spinal col- umn, coordinates the body proper. These thirteen main articulations plus the twenty digits of the hand and feet conspire to make the human the perfect exemplar of 13:20 timing frequency, that is, a perfect model of synchronization itself. Add to this the fact that the human has a highly evolved and refined brain and nervous system that is maintained and expressed by the skeletal structure of the thirteen joints of the body and limbs, completed by the sensitive mechanism of the twenty digits, and we see that the human is the perfect biocomputer for processing the information of the instantaneously telepathic geocosmic mind. The means to process the geocosmic information, and also the means by which the human is trans- formed into the noospheric chip, is found in matching its factors of daily synchroni- zation and intelligence with those of the psi bank, the noospheric control panel. This is called harmonic arrangement of the synchronic order. Of course, this description of generalized structure, activity, and interaction of the Homo noosphericus with the noosphere as such presupposes an entire reorientation of the goals and methods of being human. Such a reorientation of the human is also a function of making the radical change from the erroneous measure of the twelve- I 36 .

The readiness to make this change depends on the degree of moral revulsion the human experiences during the collapse of the technosphere. This moral revulsion would then correspond to a turning in the deepest seat of consciousness, which would then dispose the human intelligence to a consideration of the untried solution-change the calendar! The Thirteen Moon calendar is the NET instrument for daily synchronization and unification of the human species as a single organism in time. Once adopted to the correct measure of this instrument, the human will de facto trigger the noosphere as an operating system of absolutely higher consciousness and mental order. In fact, the purpose of human evolution is precisely to become the ignition of the noosphere,"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"and thence to become normalized as the noospheric chips that maintain the opera- tions of the noosphere. As a truly planetized being and consciousness, Homo noospher- icus will engage in an order and type of reflective activity undreamed of in the technospheric era that is now passing. First, by adapting to the daily NET timing instrument, the humans will be uti- lizing a \"calendar\" that correlates both a 365-day solar biotelepathic cycle and a 260- day galactic synchronization cycle. When the lunar phases are added to the interac- tion of these two cycles, then the human is able to enjoy the harmonic richness of time-the noosphere. The synchronizing and interactive measures of the counts of the solar and galactic cycles yield multiple levels of harmonic orders of time (Earth's \"thought moments\") that will activate aspects and levels of consciousness hitherto dormant in the human mind. The very mental act of replacing the order of twelve by the order of thirteen is a profound one. How is this so? Could it be that the whole of civilized history itself is based on the fear of the number thirteen-triskaidekaphobia, epitomized in the superstition about Friday the thirteenth-and that, therefore, deal- ing with the true nature of time has been avoided altogether?2 Currently humans operate by a world standard whose measure includes: seven- day weeks, inclusive of the notions of the 5 -day work week and the 2 -day weekend; an irregular distribution of twelve months of either thirty-one, thirty, or, in one instance, twenty-eight days; all set within a longer annual cycle that concludes with its visionless moment of New Year's Eve. Many Gregorian calendars will include the phases of the moon, but because the months differ in length there is no way in these calendars of seeing how the phases of the moon might be synchronized with the measure of Earth's orbit around the sun, nor is there any reason to consider that the uneven measure of twelve months has anything intrinsically to do with the solar orbit. Within the twelve-month structure of the Gregorian calendar, weeks, months, and phases of the moon all appear to be haphazard and arbitrary. Such a disorderly order can only bode an undercurrent of uncertainty and fear for the human mind. By contrast, in the measure of the thirteen moons of twenty-eight days each, the 13 corresponds both to a 13 -day cycle and to the cycle of the number of months (moons) per year. The measure of the 7 -day week (a NET quarter hour) becomes an orderly harmonic: four perfect weeks occurring each moon, fifty-two perfect weeks each year, each week always beginning and ending on the same day of the week, week after week, year after year, while in fact every day of every moon occurs on the same day of the week, year after year. The effect of such a harmonic regularity on the human mind is incalculable. This is what is meant by a perpetual calendar. And to maintain this perfect regularity, the 365th day of every year (solar orbit), is no day of 138 .

Realizing that a day is actually a kin or one NET minute, the measure of one rotation of Earth on its axis, a 4-day cycle of four NET minutes constitutes a har- monic, a 5-day cycle constitutes a chromatic, while the 13-day cycle corresponds to one wavespell, the time constant that accommodates the measure of thirteen. Hence, a wavespell can be either thirteen days, thirteen weeks, thirteen moons, thirteen years, or so forth. The point is that by making the change of calendars the founda- tions of the mind organized in time are irrevocably altered. From the noospheric perspective, there is nothing arbitrary about the laws of nature. The same lack of arbitrariness should be reflected in the instruments that we use to measure time. By adapting to the Thirteen Moon/2 8- Day measure, the humans are adapting to a mea- sure in which there is nothing arbitrary because it is a pure expression of the Law of Time. Thirteen is not at all a harbinger of bad luck, but the gateway to harmony in time! And it is by using this thirteen-based harmonic instrument of measure that the human is realized as a noospheric chip, a fractal of the noospheric mind, the mind of time on Earth. NOOSPHERIC CHIPS: WIZARDS OF GALACTIC TIME In the noospheric construction of the operating mechanism of the Timeship, the human is a vital link, providing the biotelepathic medium for the synchronization of the geocosmic mind on Earth. If we look again at the structure of the noosphere, the components include: the crystal core bipolar oscillator, packed with Technicolor time beams and cosmic thought moments, waiting to be self-reflectively realized; the hu- man noospheric chip, the representative of the biosphere to mentally engage the timing cycles of the NET; the electromagnetic field, which provides the medium of expression between the biospheric order, the human, and the noospheric mind of time; and the noosphere itself, the mind of time on Earth, whose articulation through the psi bank control panels and through the Earth's resonant field structure yields an enlarged measure of Earth consciousness, Noospheric Earth Time itself. In expand- ing our minds into the noosphere we will understand that what lives is the Earth and the Earth lives through us. As a noospheric chip, the human is a fractal reflector of the 13 :20 timing fre- quency. Midway between the bipolar oscillator and the noospheric psi bank plates, the human noospheric chip is designed to receive, transduce, and transmit pro- grams from the crystal core by synchronizing these programs with the psi bank. Humans-Noospheric Chips. I 39"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"This is a process that can occur only within the construct of the regular harmonic sequence provided by the noospheric timing gauge of the Thirteen Moon/28-Day calendar. Interaction with the crystal core can only be through telepathic means, and the human-as the midway point between the core and the electromagnetic fields-is like a sensitive piece of litmus paper. To understand the human in this way is to totally redefine the reality of what it means to be human on Earth. From this perspective, the human is a biocomputer whose information source feeds it programs stored and ema- nated by the crystal core. These programs are then brought into conscious registra- tion through working the corresponding programs of the psi bank. Right now, we don't know what the crystal core is emanating, much less that such a structure exists within the Earth. Like a crystal radio-set, the noosphere is the antenna, the geocosmic programs are transduced and generated at the crystal core, the human is the biocosmic tuner, and the broadcast transmission is provided by the psi bank. The 13 :20 template of the human noospheric chip is defined as the human holon, its twenty digits and thirteen main articulations conforming perfectly to the geocosmic 13:20 synchronization frequency of universal time. It is the intrinsic resonance of this geocosmic structure that allows the human to be in resonance with the planet as a whole system. While the timing programs to be broadcast are all loaded in the psi bank control boards, the actual point in space of the physical Earth is coded by time into a twenty-part icosahedral structure called a planet holon. Being holonomic in nature, the planet holon has a perfect incidence of correspondence with the twenty digits of the human holon. The twenty digits and twenty-part structure of the planet holon are both coded by the twenty icons or solar seals of the 260-day galactic synchronization cycle. The icons or seals are the manifestations of the 20 (4 x 5) factor of the 13 :20 synchroniza- tion ratio. They are coded for human legibility as simple icons that conform to a postliterate alphabet. In time these twenty icons create a fourth-dimensional twenty- day solar cycle which interacts with the 13-day galactic cycle to create the 260 unit synchronization sequence or \"galactic spin.\" The point is that when this galactic spin is synchronized with the 365-day solar-lunar measure of the Thirteen Moon count, there is a daily program for identifying the human with the planet holon, a factor that facilitates the planetary resonance of the noospheric chip. As a noospheric chip, the human is in every way a holonomic reflection of the whole system Earth. As a system of resonators-gravitational, electromagnetic, and biopsychic-the human and the Earth both have bodies with a center of gravity; both exhibit electromagnetic fields; and both share in common a biopsychic reso- nance, the mutual interface of the noosphere or mind of time with the other two Humans-Noospheric Chips.

What will the human do when history has been eliminated from the calendar and the new calendar itself is actually operated as a synchronometer-a measure of synchronicity? First of all, as the necessary prelude to galactic culture, the absolute synchroni- zation of the human in geocosmic time, the technosphere will be dismantled. Reor- ganized by the Law of Time into psychic biomes, the dismantling will naturally phase into the genuine creation of the new culture of solar-galactic consciousness. \"Path beyond technology\" means path of telepathic harmony. With its goals abso- lutely reoriented following the mental pole shift of the calendar change, the hierarchy of human values will also undergo a profound reordering. What if money were no longer the first consideration in human affairs? What if the consideration were in- stead how artful or artistic that action or event might be? What if the diaspora of humanity through industrialization and mass transport came to an end and the hu- mans willingly chose to live in smaller communities organized by gardening and other Earth-related activities, inclusive of the transformative dismantling of the technosphere and the regeneration of the biospheric medium? What if the study of time replaced the study of physics as the dominant mode for determining the nature of reality? And what if, due to the time shift, a spiritual awakening swept through the human race so that a moral orientation of values was organized around the preserva- tion and furtherance of the biosphere, and an acknowledgement that only One Su- preme Creator could have ordained something so perfect as the noospheric mind of time? What kind of world would that be? What kind of art would be practiced in that world and what kind of science would be known? Organized by the NET, human existence would spiral into the collective tele- pathic mind. A type of Earth geomancy would become the science of the noosphere. Or perhaps a more accurate name for this science would be Earth geochronomancy- the study and investigation of Earth in relation to the cycles of cosmic time and telepathy with an end to perfecting the Earth as a work of art. With minds expanded toward accommodating the longer, slower measure of NET, geochronomancy would inspire an entirely new vision of the Earth within the heliosphere (the solar system) and the galactosphere (the galactic order of things). Making the Earth's rainbow brain visible and manifest would be only the beginning of a willingness to explore further untapped psychic energy sources and means, or what is referred to in Earth Ascending as the science of radiosonics.

Would this not make the human species into a race of wizards? In this consideration we may find a reason why the 260-day unit galactic syn- chronization measure-a galactic spin-is the key to what is called the Wizard's Count. The perfect synchronization of the 260-unit galactic spin with the 365 -day Thirteen Moon/28-Day solar orbit establishes the 52-year cycle, or one NET year. A NET year (fifty-two solar orbits) is a \"wizard's measure,\" for on this measure the human can expand its consciousness to encompass the Earth in its greater cycles of develop- ment. The Wizard's Count is also given its name because of the set of the four solar icons or seals that code the July 26 synchronization date in 4-year cycles: year one, Yellow Seed year; year two, Red Moon year; year three, White Wizard year; and year four, Blue Storm year. An entire Seed-Moon- Wizard-Storm sequence of four NET days (four solar orbits) consists of fifty-two moons, or one NET week, the perfect fractal of the fifty-two 7 -day weeks in one NET day and the fifty-two solar orbits in one NET year. This four-part sequence is also called a Seed-Storm year bundle, the harmonic essence of the wizard's measure. Thirteen Seed-Storm year bundles, where each of the four icons is coded by the thirteen galactic tones (4 x 13 = 52), yield one NET year. Please note that even the Gregorian July 26 synchronization date is a func- tion of the synchronic order: July = 7, while 26 is 13 doubled, 7 and 13 being the two principle numbers governing the 13:20 matrix of the Harmonic Module! In the symbolism of the iconic sequence it is the Seed that is planted, it is the Moon that coordinates the growth cycles, it is the Storm that generates the energy, and it is the Wizard who knows and acts upon what is given. It was a White Galactic Wizard that coded the date and coordinated the year beginning July 26, 1987- followed twenty-one days later by the Harmonic Convergence. Thus it was the White Galactic Wizard who opened the gates to the closing of the Mayan baktun cycle of history and the commencement of the coming cycle of galactic culture. And on July 26,2003, the year of the White Spectral Wizard will commence. This year will end with its Day Out of Time, coded by the White Spectral Mirror. The day following, July 26,2004, will begin the year of the Blue Crystal Storm. On the Wizard's Count, which is not a calendar but a synchronometer, these two dates, White Spectral Mir- ror and Blue Crystal Storm, are the point in time when the Gregorian calendar ticket to the old time will be eliminated and the new Thirteen Moon calendar ticket for admission to the new time of the noosphere will be validated.

Its premises are so diametrically opposite to those of the technosphere that, especially in the power bases of America and the G-7, one will find scant men- tion or notice at all of this movement. Yet it is a cultural phenomenon. In Tokyo, San Francisco, Milan, or Moscow one may find signs of the presence of this movement in the underground dance events, the raves or the Earthdance. More and more young people take on the names of their galactic signatures, the 260-day kin code for their date of birth in the synchronic order, names like Lunar Storm or Spectral Night, Galactic Wind or Planetary Dragon. These are all signs of the beginning of galactic culture on Earth, a phenomenon that has only been increasing over the past decade. The point is that the New Calendar Change Movement is a grassroots phenomenon as well as an ideological strategy known as the Campaign for the New Time. These signs are all whispers of the noosphere blowing through the bleak industrial corners of the technosphere. Behind the more populist front of the Natural Time Movement is the science of the Law of Time, a genuinely noospheric science of peace and harmony. This sci- ence is already being studied and put into preliminary practice. As the crisis of the biosphere began to crest in 1987, halfway through the second 28-year phase of the technosphere, the noosphere began to download its measure of time through the Making the Transition to the New Time. 1 4 7"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"discovery of the Law of Time. Invisible to the predominant forces of the technosphere, the science of the Law of Time began to map out an entirely new domain of thought, the synchronic order, a domain that could only be entered and applied through the correct noospheric measure, the Thirteen Moon/28-Day synchronometer. All science throughout history is based on evolutionary advances predicated on both the premises and limitations of its preceding stages. We are at such an evolu- tionary moment now. The issue of the calendar change is only the beginning of the emergence of a new whole system scientific order. Understanding the flaws that are built into the present system of purely materialist science, we can proceed to the establishment of the science of the synchronic order. Like the radical simplicity and perpetual harmony of the Thirteen Moon calendar itself, the noospheric science of the synchronic order is predicated on an equally radical mathematical base reflect- ing and embedded in the 13:20 universal timing frequency itself. And as the under- lying order of a whole system science, this mathematics is reflective of the non dualistic premise of a superior moral order. The deviation from universal synchronic time is a moral deviation as well. It is this moral deviation that most strongly prompts the current calendar change movement. As a profoundly nondualistic, unifying whole system premise, the Law of Time encompasses not only a scientific-mathematical basis of morality, but a theological- eschatological intention that reunifies the various disciplines scattered and separated by the rise and totalitarianism of modern secular science. Because of the historical dominance of the Gregorian calendar, in which modern science is embedded, the dethronement of the calendar-the \"devaticanization\" of the world, as it were-is an apocalyptic moment. As the Law of Time defines it, this is merely the apocalypse of the 12 :60 timing frequency and all its corrupted institutions, much as foretold in the Book of Revela- tions. This apocalyptic moment was stunningly supplied by the terrifying collapse of the Twin Towers. As the nerve center of the financial, commodities, and transport sector of the technosphere, and hence of the city itself, the collapse of the towers in hardly more than an hour's time is perfectly reflected in the vivid descriptions of the eighteenth chapter of the Book of Revelations, \"Fall of Babylon.\" Yet as the Mayan prophecy of Pacal Votan also makes absolutely clear, the apocalypse of the 12:60 is the resurrection into the 13 :20 timing frequency, the return to natural time, all to be accomplished by A.D. 2012, Teilhard de Chardin's \"omega point.\" The advent of the noosphere is preceded by the post-apocalyptic harrowing of hell. In this harrowing of hell, defined as the span of time fromJuly 26, 2000-July 25,2004, humanity must make a crossing from one time to another. This crossing is much like those we hear 1 4 8 .

That's the shock- ing prediction of the man who was responsible for the gathering of hundreds of thousands of people in 1987 to celebrate the Harmonic Convergence. . .\" The ar- ticle makes its point by referring to the end of the 5,125 year cycle in 2012. \"Argiielles said Mayan predictions have always come true. He said their prediction for the year 2012 is that if humanity learns to live in harmony with Nature, a new age of miracles and light will occur. Otherwise plagues, wars, terrorism, and finally, the breakup of the planet into asteroids, will take place.\"4 As for the Inevitable Event, it would appear that humanity has begun the worst of the prediction-plagues, war, terrorism-yet, from the noospheric perspective, two points mitigate the absolute plunge into hell. The first is that the Inevitable Event punctured a hole in the technosphere eleven years prior to 2012. What does this mean? It means that this is the time of hell on Earth. \"Every single one of you must see it [hell]; this is an irrevocable decision of your Lord.\" (Quran, 19:71) This being so, we can potentially emerge from it before the 2012 omega point. The other mitigating factor is the existence of a 13:20 movement dispersed throughout hu- manity. Since the noosphereis the 13:20 mind of Earth, the Thirteen Moon Calen- dar Change Peace Movement is the advance presence heralding the transition from the biosphere to the noosphere. This passage through hell is of a four-year duration, 2000-2004. The exponential implosion of the technosphere has already begun. But to avoid a long, debilitating siege of barbarism, humanity must select a positive di- rection by 2004 so that it can make it to the 2012 deadline as a species returned to living in harmony with nature.

You shall not fear that you may get caught, nor shall you worry. \"Pharaoh pursued them with his troops, but the sea overwhelmed them, as it was destined to overwhelm them. \" -QURAN, 20:77-78 The Thirteen Moon/28-Day calendar is the dry path across the waters of the 12:60 chaos. Holding surely to this path, \"Pharaoh's troops will be overwhelmed,\" as it is destined, for the truth always prevails and when falsehood is exposed, falsehood perishes. The 12:60 frequency enshrined in the Gregorian calendar represents an artificial, hence false notion of time. The Pharaoh's troops are the forces of the technosphere that, embedded in the artificial structure of the Gregorian calendar, are destined to be overwhelmed and overcome by the fury unleashed both by human nature and nature itself in response to decades, if not centuries, of irresponsible despoiling of the Earth. The dry path of the Thirteen Moon/28-Day calendar is the only path broad enough for all humanity to leave the ever increasing ocean of chaos that characterizes human existence bound in the collapsing 12:60 matrix born of Gregorian civilization, the technosphere. Yes, the dry path across the waters of the 12:60 chaos provided by the Thirteen Moon/28-Day calendar truly is for the salva- tion of life on Earth. Ever since 1993, the Thirteen Moon Calendar Change Peace Movement has consciously been drawing from the infinite riches of the noosphere to create not only the mechanism for making a shift in the frequency and hence bring stabiliza- tion to the biosphere, but has been anticipating the biosphere-noosphere transition into the Pax Cultura, Pax Biospherica. Foll{)wing in the footsteps of its predecessor, the new calendar movement has dutifully contacted the United Nations and the Vatican and convened various con- gresses and delivered ultimatums in an effort to draw attention to mankind's time malaise. Now that the Inevitable Event has fully disengaged the human mind from the reality it thought it was pursuing in the new millennium, the second definitive wave of the World Thirteen Moon Calendar Change Peace Movement has also been launched: the Campaign for the New Time. 152 . Making the Transition to the New Time"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"This campaign consists of a preparatory four-year cycle, 2000-2004, the Har- rowing of Hell, which is the duration of the campaign itself, plus a one-year trial period, 2004-2005. The goal of the four-year campaign is universal calendar re- form, the replacement of the Gregorian by the Thirteen Moon Calendar, effective Blue Crystal Storm, July 26,2004. This final year of the Blue Crystal Storm, 2004- 2005, also completes a Seed-Storm year bundle begun in 2001, fateful year of the Yellow Solar Seed, the year of the Inevitable Event. To ensure the success of this unprecedented move on the part of humanity, the calendar reform must include the one-year trial period, during which time the entire species must be operating by a new standard, the harmonic Thirteen Moon/2 8- Day synchronometer. \"If you never try it, you'll never know what it is,\" is the slogan that describes the campaign's target year: July 26, 2004-July 25, 2005, an entire year without the Gregorian \"30 days hath September. . . ,\" but instead, Thirteen Moons of Peace. To realize its ambitious goal of universal calendar reform, the Campaign for the New Time must impress itself on the human consciousness as the all-unifying campaign for peace to overcome the destructive forces unleashed by the technospheric collapse. F qrtunately, much groundwork has already been laid. The codes of the Law of Time have been formulated and compiled. Preliminary practices to engage the synchronic order of the noosphere have already enlisted humans from around the planet. What the Vatican has tried to ignore and what the United Nations has been unable to fully engage must now be brought to the forefront of all humanity as the harmonic solution. The harmonic solution is a set of logical arguments that should be studied and rehearsed by everyone who seriously wishes to even consider the possibility of a Campaign for the New Time. Let us contemplate the following set of logical arguments. Premise Currently all conflict resolution of a global scale is attained through one of two poles: a political solution or a military solution. No other alternatives are recognized. Ac- cording to the Law of Time, there is a third solution, the harmonic solution. Without this third solution, no harmonic resolution is ultimately possible for any conflict on a global scale. The third solution defines the first two solutions as a polarity embedded within a timing standard that is hopelessly irregular and that, therefore, disposes the mind to disharmony. A mind predisposed to irregularity and disharmony is incapable of producing any long-term solution. The basis of the harmonic solution is to change the timing standard from an irregular to a regular one, thereby inducing a timing sensibility that disposes the mind to harmony rather than disharmony. 15 4 . . Making the Transition to the New Time"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Thirteen Moon/28-Day Count and Global Conflict Resolution The inability to attain global peace, much less the resolution of many localized con- flicts that have become endemic, is due to a lack of a globally unifying timing standard-the macro-organizing principle of human sensibility. Present-day con- flict resolution is represented by two poles, political and military. The military solu- tion consists of guerrilla warfare, terrorism, and outright military conflict, all of which are engendered by problems of inequality; injustice; rampant nationalism; tribal, racial, or religious antagonism; and greed for control of natural resources. Underlying the military solution is an aggressive armaments industry that seeks to hold its own as a capitalist venture, always seeking new markets. The political solu- tion is always fostered as the only cure for the military solution, and is administered through varying degrees of coercion, compromise, and the inevitable lure of money- the IMF and the World Bank are never far behind any political solution. Neither the military nor the political represent any kind of morally satisfactory or enduring solution because both are functions of and embedded in a timing stan- dard that has disharmony built into it. Even the local timing systems, themselves feedback loops holding in place various belief systems, are coordinated by the domi- nant disharmonic standard. As long as the current global standard, the Gregorian calendar, is the controlling timing factor, resolution on a global and local level is not only impossible, but increasing disharmony is guaranteed. The harmonic solution calls for the immediate establishment of a globally unifying harmonic standard, the Thirteen Moon/28-Day count. With its absolutely consistent units of measure, this macro-organizing principle is a paragon of harmony and thereby represents the positive, creative, and viable first step to enduring global conflict resolution. Thirteen Moon/28-Day Paradigm Shift The harmonic solution, the alternative to the polarity of the military and political solutions, calls for the immediate replacement of the current irregular measure with the harmonic standard of the Thirteen Moon/28-Day count. This replacement con- stitutes the long-awaited and long-prepared-for paradigm shift in human conscious- ness. The very analysis and concern that engendered the first movement to replace the Gregorian calendar-the effects of an irregular measure on human behavior-is now so dire that the concluding step must be taken. To quote Einstein once again, \"Since the advent of the nuclear age, everything has changed but the way people think; thus we drift toward unparalleled catastrophe.\" With the analysis of the Law Making the Transition to the New Time. 155"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"of Time we know why thinking has not changed-the human mind is the pawn of an aberrant timing mechanism. To change the way people think, make one little change in their everyday lives: Change the calendar. If we could send a man to the moon, we can change the calendar. This change will be the first step-the rest will come easily because with this one change we shall have changed our minds and entered into a New Time. To make this one little change a target date is needed, and the people need to mobilize as a force of synchronization for peace to mandate this change. The target date is July 26, 2004--the mobilization has already begun. New Worldview of the Law of Time The Thirteen Moon/28-Day count is the pragmatic application of the Law of Time. The discovery of the Law of Time was necessitated by evolution as the only way that could offset the deleterious effects of an erroneous timing standard on human con- sciousness. The Law of Time takes the radical view that time is a frequency, the uni- versal frequency of synchronization; that the purpose of time is to synchronize; and that, therefore, a calendar is in harmony with the Law of Time to the degree to which it maximizes opportunities for synchronization. From the perspective of the Law of Time, the current macro-organizing standard is anything but synchronous, and hence contrary to the laws of nature. Synchronization produces harmony, harmony is a func- tion of beauty, and beauty is the natural result of the Law of Time: T(E) = Art, energy factored by time equals art, where art is the entire spectrum of phenomenal reality in which even the most menacing-looking creature is elegantly constructed. National Geographic recently stated: \"Beauty seems to be an intrinsic part of na- ture and perhaps even the organizing principle of reality. Scientists in testing their theories, invariably find that the simplest, most elegant, most beautiful is the correct one. Rainbows, butterflies and the periodic table are some examples of intrinsic beauty. The world will be saved by beauty.\"5 The Law of Time agrees. The world will be saved by beauty, and the proponents of peace through culture will be in the van- guard. The Law of Time formalizes the perception of the intrinsic beauty of na- ture- T(E) = Art-and thereby provides a scientifically solid critique of the ugliness and social disharmony fomented by the irregular and artificial timing standards that control humanity today. By the same formulation, the Law of Time also establishes a vast and comprehensive definition of the fourth dimension, which was wanting until now precisely because of the embedding of all current perceptions in the erro- neous timing standard. The mathematical order underlying the universal frequency of synchronization, 156 . Making the Transition to the New Time"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"13:20, describes a new order of reality, the synchronic order. The synchronic order governs the fourth-dimensional order of reality much as the laws of gravity, thermo- dynamics, and the special theory of relativity govern the third-dimensional order of reality. By taking into account the nature of the synchronic order, humanity's views of the third dimension will inevitably be altered to a greater conformity with the harmony of the fourth dimension. The fourth dimension is defined as the primary mathematical order of time, governed by a syntropic whole number system of ratios and fractals operating in a radial and nonlinear manner. The third dimension is the world of manifestation and matter that inevitably entropizes. Losing sight of the inherent harmony of the synchronic order from which it is actually inseparable, the human fixation on the increasing entropic anomalies of the third dimension produces problems such as how to reckon what appear to be the extra hours, minutes, and seconds that occur every time the Earth orbits the sun. To this seeming dilemma, the Law of Time asserts that number precedes manifestation, harmony precedes materialization, therefore manifestation must accord with num- ber, and materialization must reflect an original harmonic order. Entropy and deg- radation cause manifestation to deviate from number and mathematical law. But for mind to be stable, mind must accord with and conform to mathematical law rather than with entropy and degradation. The timing standard in use causes the mind to conform with entropy and degradation. This is what must be corrected. Harmonic Solution-Harmonic Resolution Harmony can only produce harmony. From order comes order. From disorder you can only expect chaos. From disharmony can only come disaster. Irregular measure entropizes. Harmonic measure syntropizes. These are the contrasting values brought into focus by replacing an irregular macro-organizing principle with a regular one. Implementation of a globally unifying harmonic standard is the only hope for re- solving all conflicts in time. A harmonic standard lifts all conflicts to a higher level dialog of unification in time. The harmonic solution, the World Thirteen Moon Calendar Change Peace Plan, provides: the opportunity to call an immediate and universal cease-fire, as well as a halt to the otherwise inexorable process of entropic degradation of society and environment; and offers the resolution to establish new agreements, to renegotiate old treaties, and to create a new globally binding and unifying covenant for all people in a new time. It must be understood that to change the calendar is to delegitimize all the insti- tutions embedded in it. This radical but peaceful delegitimization of the old order is Making the Transition to the New Time. 157"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"what is needed to break the deadlocks, stalemates, and historically outmoded trea- ties and agreements now binding on humanity. The new globally unifying standard, the Thirteen Moon/28-Day count, will legitimize and institutionalize harmony and thus create the advent of a synergistic order capable of resolving entropic disorder because it is reflective of and rooted in the primordial whole number structure of the synchronic order of reality. In its entirety, this represents a new step and direction for human evolution-a step without which there might not be any creative future for humanity and the planet. How to Accomplish World Peace Now The analysis, the historical precedents, and now the affirming authority of the Law of Time render the harmonic solution as the only way to immediately bring about World Peace. All that is lacking is the will to synchronization among all good-hearted people, groups, and organizations otherwise committed to peace, a better environ- ment, and human spiritual well-being in general. How to accomplish World Peace is to galvanize the human will to synchronization on behalf of the establishment of a genuine time of harmony and peace. This can only come about through the simple but highly radical and paradigm-altering act of exchanging the current macro- organizing system of the Gregorian calendar for the harmonic order of the Thirteen Moon/28-Day count. All other localized calendar systems would be kept intact, but they would be coordinated by a new standard, a standard that promises harmony instead of disaster, order instead of chaos, peace instead of war. Such is the harmonic analysis and solution of the Law of Time, which can be summed up by a simple demonstration of the irregular Gregorian calendar con- trasted with the regular Thirteen Moon calendar, as well as the question: \"Which do you prefer, harmony or disharmony?\" If you answer this question on behalf of harmony, and you agree with the fore- going premises and analyses, you must move into action. You need to get a new calendar, a Thirteen Moon/2 8- Day calendar and find out for yourself: noosphere or necrosphere, the choice is yours. The option opened by the Inevitable Event and the collapse of the technosphere is precisely that: necrosphere, the transformation of ! the biosphere into a sphere of death-a dead planet-or the noosphere, the mental envelope of the Earth, governed on the human plane by the Thirteen Moon/2 8- Day calendar. The difference between the necrosphere and the noosphere is the differ- ence between a machine and the Earth as a whole system. You cannot even really say there is a comparison. But what we can say most emphatically is that the Thirteen 158 .

It is the only antidote to the destructive grip that the 12 :60 timing frequency now has upon the biosphere through its thoroughly artifi- cial instrument, the technosphere. (See plate 7, Necrosphere or Noosphere.) THE FINAL DECISION: NOOSPHERE OR NECROSPHERE? As these lines are being written, seven weeks have passed since the Inevitable Event. The analysis of this event from the perspective of the biosphere, the temporary struc- ture of the technosphere, and the advent of the noosphere was a spontaneous inspi- ration. Each morning, often well before dawn, I would be called to this technospheric device, an iMac, to put the noospheric mandate down into words. In this process, the matter of prophecy kept occurring and could not be avoided. Even the issue of calendar change increasingly takes on the quality of a prophetic enactment. What is prophecy from the noospheric perspective? Prophecy is the release of information according to the psi bank timing program and in relation to degrees or levels of consciousness positioned at different points in time. The points in time are human channels. That is, there are the prophets who declare the prophecies by whatever means or forms, and then there are the decoders of the prophecies, those able to read the signs according to the prophecies with the aid of different symbolic lexicons. Prophecy is always startling to the mass mind, which is ignorant of the true nature of time. A prophetic event may seem totally random, when it is not. Someone may design a plot, such as that of the Inevitable Event, with whatever fantastic notions and motives. Yet the occurrence may go be- yond being merely a matter of human manipulation. The humans were but the in- struments of sets of cause-and-effect chain reactions established within the structure and evolution of the biosphere and the playing out of human karma. According to the psi bank timing program governed by the Law of Time, the technosphere could only have a limited duration. Two perfect 28-year cycles of the Gregorian calendar program, leading to the first year of the third millennium, marked the duration of the technosphere. Because this cycle concluded with the beginning of the third Christian millennium, a singular event was poised in time to attract and catalyze a host of prophetic moments long prepared for and sealed in the psi bank by Christian, Islamic, and even Mayan prophecies. Such was the Inevitable Event. Within the motivations of the perpetrators of the Inevitable Event, the biosphere found its perfect instrument of divine purpose. That there were nineteen hijackers conforms to the Quranic nineteen code expressed in the enigmatic verse, \"Over it is nineteen.\" Making the Transition to the New Time. 159"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"(74:30) The following verse begins, \"We appointed angels to be guardians of Hell, and we assigned their number [19] . . .\" This verse ends by asking, \"What did God mean by this allegory? . . . None knows the soldiers of your Lord except He. This is a reminder for the people.\" (74: 31) Certainly in the success of their mission, whether they were conscious of it or not, the nineteen Muslim hijackers-who organized themselves as four leaders (pi- lots), three logistics people, and twelve \"soldiers\"-fulfilled their function of being the prophetic emissaries of the nineteen guardian angels who watch over Hell. And indeed the gates to Hell have been opened. In the world of the secular mind of the technosphere, no one wanted to talk about the apocalypse or Armageddon, though the jihad was brought up quite often as a factor in the thinking of the Islamic terrorists.6 Whether it is seen as a prophetic or karmic event, as we stated earlier, there is no question that the timing programs of two civilizations, the Gregorian and the Is- lamic, were on a collision course. \"The civilization of Islam is radically so different from that of Western civilization which dominates the world today. The two are different in their description oflife as well as the foundation on which they base such a description. The difference between the two civilizations is so essential that they have developed in ways which are radically contradictory to each other.\"7 So wrote the eloquent Saudi historian, Muhammad Husayn Haykal in his essay \"Islamic Civi- lization,\" as presented in his masterful biography, The Life of Muhammad. And what is at the root of this difference? A separation of church and state, which in the West led to a profound materialism and economic worldview. Haykal continues, \"The victory of materialist thinking was largely due to the establishment of Western civilization primarily upon an economic foundation. This situation led to the rise in the West of a number of worldviews which sought to place everything in the life of man and the world at the mercy of economic forces. . .\" As for the sanctity of its economic beliefs, Haykal concludes that the West has tied its economic activity \"hand and foot by public laws and commanded that every Western state and army prevent any violation of economic laws with all the power and coer- cive means at its disposal.\"8 Given this insightful assertion by an Islamic thinker written a half-century ago, it is not at all surprising that the terrorists concentrated their attacks on the most visible symbols of Western global materialism and economic and military imperialism, the Twin Towers and the Pentagon. It is also of note that one of the logistics men on the team of nineteen hijackers, Majed Moqed, had been a professor of economics at King Saudi University in Riyadh.

Making the Transition to the New Time"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Trade Center towers and the penetration of the Pentagon was the Inevitable Event both from the point of view of the biosphere and from that of prophecy as mandated by at least two major timing programs, the Gregorian and the Islamic. Of course, prophecy is a matter far from the consideration of the technocratic mind, so the immediate aftereffect is a heightened nationalism, patriotism, and commitment to war. But what is going on from the noospheric point of view is not so much the combat of different armed camps defending or attacking competing ideologies, but an end game, the biomass of the technosphere maneuvering against time in a self- destructive process that is really nothing more than the continuing collapse of that which it is defending. How long will this collapse take? With the weapons of mass destruction cur- rently at the disposal of the combatants, it shouldn't take too long before the human race realizes that if it doesn't stop the self-destructive process, it will soon be curtains for all life on Earth. A more significant question, if we wish to make the transition to a new time, is: How will the self-destruction end, and how can it be stopped-or can it? It is easy to see how wars begin, but no one can tell how they will end. THE SOLUTION TO WAR: PEACE THROUGH CULTURE, PEACE OF THE BIOSPHERE At the end of the First World War, the League of Nations was formed to keep the Second World War from happening. The League of Nations was unable to both effect the calendar reform it promoted and keep the Second World War from hap- pening. These are not unrelated events. The Second World War effectively elimi- nated the League of Nations, and toward its end a new organization, the United Nations, was formed. Like the League of Nations, the United Nations was formed to prevent the next world war from happening. Within eleven years, the United Nations tabled the calendar reform begun by the League of Nations. Coincident with the formation of the technosphere, the United Nations has now also completed fifty-six years of existence. With the expanding \"war against terrorism,\" is its pur- pose now over as well? The only way the United Nations can survive is to maintain its humanitarian agencies, for the age of nationalist politics and nation-states is over, succeeded by the politics of terrorism, the last politics of history. What new kind of global organization will we need at the end of the War on Terror, or World War III? What we will need is an entirely new agency, a Planetary Biospheric Assembly that will model and create a sustainable Pax Cultura, Pax Biospherica.

If the United Nations could accept the route of calendar change as the only way to bring all humanity to a new point of discourse, then it could take on a renewed life. But if it cannot rise to this occasion, then another organization must take its place, the Planetary Biospheric Assembly. Even so, when we speak of the Pax Cultura, Pax Biospherica, we are speaking of a new human cov- enant, one in which the biosphere takes precedence over all nationalist corporate interests, and in which peace as a manifestation of culture is the primary value of the new time. Such a covenant would be a biospheric covenant, an agreement and un- derstanding that, first of all, the human is a member of the biosphere, and second, that in consciously accepting the calendar change, the human is also in the process of becoming Homo noosphericus. Henceforth, it will be art and not money, bioregions and not nation-states, that will be the cause of social organization. Only in this way will humanity be guaranteed a true post-historical future. Assuming the calendar change occurs on Blue Crystal Storm 2004, the first step in ~ngendering the full manifestation of the noosphere will be the dismantling of the technosphere. This can only be accomplished if a full reorganization of the human in time, inclusive of an adjudication of inequalities and a redistribution of wealth, begins to occur during the 2004-2005 Crystal Storm year. The following four years, 2005-2009, a genuine First World Peace, would see the constructive transformation of the five-part technospheric system. All the apparatus of heavy industry, energy, and the transport system would be turned like compost, to be replaced by non- polluting technologies and means of transport, while the cities would be transformed into urban gardens with the human race once more becoming decentralized. This process itself, a massive planetary engineering project with an eye on the full devel- opment of geochronomancy, would prove to be the greatest and most thoroughly positive transformation in human history. By 2009 humans reorganized by the Law of Time and having finally arrived at the \"path beyond technology,\" will be enjoying universal telepathy, the noosphere-life beyond the Internet. By 2012 the humans will realize peace through culture as a permanent value, and by 2013 Earth will be galactically synchronized through a fully activated noosphere into the beginning of an entirely new geological era, defined by Vernadsky as the Psychozoic Era. Pax Cultura, Pax Biospherica refers to both the new era of humanity following the devastation of the Final War and the governing body of bioregional councils (not nation-states) comprising the new world \"government,\" the Planetary Biospheric 162 .

CONCISE HOMO NOOSPHERICUS HOW-TO TIME TRAVELER'S GUIDE TO THE BIOSPHERE-NOOSPHERE TRANSITION This analysis of the Inevitable Event could never have occurred if the Law of Time hadn't been discovered and defined. The Inevitable Event simply supplied the Law of Time with precisely the right historical moment to provide a thorough analysis and explanation of time as the whole system in which we humans live and operate, inclusive of the biosphere, the technosphere, and the noosphere. As the chief discov- erer of the Law of Time, assisted by my wife and an increasing number of other humans who have engaged the Law of Time, I have sought only to make a presenta- tion of matters in which we, as a species, are thoroughly immersed, and thus find difficult to comprehend. Such is the technosphere, and such also is the medium of time. Since the publication of The Mayan Factor and my pursuit of the underlying mathematics of the Mayan calendar, I have remained outside the conventional are- nas of discourse and communication, preferring instead to remain more anonymous in order to test the various hypotheses of the Law of Time. In this process over the past twelve years, the Law of Time has precipitated from the noosphere various tools and didactic texts, all for the purpose of enabling us to make the shift from the old paradigm of the time of war to the new paradigm of the time of peace. These tools and principles are actually practiced on a daily basis, and so provide a pragmatic means of applying the Law of Time. Because of my vows and need for scientific \"purity\" of the experiment I have been living, I was involved at all times in doing my utmost to remain in the 13:20 frequency. For this reason, the tools and texts prompted by the noosphere to define the Law of Time were, for the most part, all produced outside the commercial mainstream. Now a great effort must be taken to make these tools and texts available to humanity in order to assist in the transition from Homo historicus to Homo noosphericus. By presenting a catalog of these tools and texts we only mean to suggest and define for the reader the scope and existence of a preliminary science of time and telepathy. .

The Tools: Establishing Noospheric Earth Time (NET) THIRTEEN MOON/28-DAY SYNCHRONOMETER The harmonic standard of noospheric time, the Thirteen Moon/28-Day synchron- ometer, is a perpetual, harmonic calendar. It is called a Moon calendar because it is based on the female 28-day menstruation cycle, which is also the average lunar cycle. In actuality the moon goes around the Earth thirteen times a year. This means that the Thirteen Moon calendar is a genuine solar-lunar calendar that measures the Earth's orbit around the sun by the apsidallunation cycle of twenty-eight days. Thir- teen perfect months of 28 days = 52 perfect weeks of 7 days = 364 days. The 365th day is called the Day Out of Time because it is no day of the week or month at all. This day, which falls on the Gregorian correlate date ofJuly 25, is a day for forgiveness and the artistic celebration of life and freedom. The synchronization or New Year's date of the Thirteen Moon calendar is July 26, and corresponds to the rising of the great star Sirius. This makes the Thirteen Moon calendar a tool for harmonizing our- selves with the galaxy. Of course, the Thirteen Moon calendar also synchronizes the phases of the moon in a pattern that demonstrates its regularity and order. One of the great advantages of the Thirteen Moon synchronometer is that day/ date calculations are amazingly simple. Any day of any week is the same for any Moon, any year. The first day of every Moon is always a Thirteen Moon Sunday (Dali). The last day of every Moon is always a Thirteen Moon Saturday (Silio). In the Thirteen Moon calendar the obscurely named Gregorian months are replaced by names that correspond to a fourth-dimensional cosmology of time. Each Moon also has a totem animal. The traditional names of the days of the week are replaced by galactic names that describe seven primary plasmas-electronically charged par- ticles that activate our magnetic fields. The plasmas and their symbolic seals appear above the days of the week. The Gregorian calendar makes day/date calculations very difficult because the months are of uneven measure so the days and dates of the week vary from month to month and year to year. The Thirteen Moon calendar is truly unique because it is synchronized with the Harmonic Module, the measure of the universal 13:20 timing frequency. THE HARMONIC MODULE The basis of the Tzolkin or sacred 260-day count of the Maya, the Harmonic Mod- ule is the 13:20 synchronization gauge and permutation table that consists of thirteen sequences of twenty icons or solar seals and twenty sequences of thirteen galactic tones, 1-13.

The two cycles-Thirteen Moons/28 days and the 260-day Harmonic Module-perfectly mesh every fifty-two years to complete one NET year. In one NET year of 18,980 kin, no two days are the same! Each of the units in the Harmonic Module is called a kin, the base unit of synchronic measure. Articulating the Harmonic Module is a pattern of fifty-two Galactic Activation Por- tals. See if you can find the radial sequence of thirteen sets of four, counting inward from the corners. Notice that the numbers of each set of four equals 28. Thirteen sets x 28 = 364, the number of days in the Thirteen Moon calendar! (See image containing the Harmonic Module on page 170.) W AVESPELL The thirteen-unit form constant of fourth-dimensional time is the wavespell. It is important to see the Thirteen Moon calendar in this modular format, Planetary Service Wavespell, for then it makes more sense to speak of the calendar as a synchronometer. The wavespell's form describes the motion of time as a fractal fourth- dimensional cosmology. The numbers 1-13 in the dot bar notation that code the thirteen positions are known as tones. The names of the tones in sequence define the cosmology, which is also evident in the very structure of the wavespell. The thirteen tones give their names to the thirteen Moons. The structure consists of two gates, the Magnetic and the Cosmic, the first and the thirteenth moons/tones, which correspond to the two entrance and exit gates or portals. Complementing the two gates are the two towers, the fifth or Overtone tower and the ninth or Solar tower. The two gates and the two towers, tones 1, 5, 9, and 13, articulate the structure of the wavespell. Between the places of articulation are three sets of chambers. The first set, tones 2- 3-4, helps establish the wavespell; the second set, tones 6-7 -8, helps extend the wavespell; and the third set, 10-11-12, serves to convert the wavespell.

Each of these dimensional geometries is known as a pulsar. It is useful to know the pulsars in extending the mind synchronically over different timing sequences. The fourth-dimensional pulsar connects the four points of articulation, 1-5-9-13, or Magnetic, Overtone, Solar, and Cosmic Moon/tones, and is called the fourth-dimensional time pulsar. The first- dimension life pulsar connects the positions 2-6-10, or Lunar-Rhythmic-Planetary Moon/tones.

It is this cosmol- ogy that makes the Dreamspell a psychoactive tool kit for personally engaging you in the fourth-dimensional synchronic order of time. The fundamental premise for making it psychoactive lies in finding your galactic signature, the color, icon, and tone that code your date of birth. This combination of factors-color, tone, and icon-establishes a mathematical code that allows you to use your galactic signature in mapping increasing orders of synchronicity.

The point of engaging the Dreamspell is to learn of the infinite possibilities of fractal synchronic mapping of the events of your life and the lives of your family and friends, as well as current events and human history. The compass and boards describe the radial mathematics of fourth-dimensional time and also pro- vide the means for fully engaging the synchronic order of the noospheric mind. The interactive complex of changing the family and clan relations to which the galactic signature entitles you also provides the basic patterns of social organization in time. The Dreamspell is indispensable for education concerning the radial, fractal nature of fourth-dimensional time and mathematics. TELEKTONON Meaning \"Earth Spirit Speaking Tube,\" Telektonon is the name of the prophecy of Pacal Votan, and the definition of a complex program for establishing universal te- lepathy. It should be noted that the tomb of Pacal Votan was discovered in 1952, after 1,260 years, because of a tile tube, the Earth Spirit Speaking Tube, which ran from the top of the pyramid temple, down the secret stairwell, and into the wall of the elaborate tomb beneath the pyramid. The prophecy itself was decoded from the inscriptions and symbols of the elaborately carved sarcophagus lid of the tomb. Es- sentially defining a period of \"Seven Years of Prophecy,\" (1993-2000), followed by a 13-year Cycle of Creation (2000-2013), the Telektonon is practiced on a daily basis by means of a board and various moving parts. The purpose of the daily play is to learn how to operate by a set of coordinates that define the nature of telepathic consciousness as the interplay of five circuits that con- nect the ten planetary orbits (the Asteroid Belt, remnants of the lost fifth planet Maldek, is included as one of these orbits). The key interplanetary connection is between Earth, the third planet, and Uranus, the eighth planet, which creates the third or biotelepathic circuit. The Earth-Uranus circuit constitutes twenty-eight steps and thus corresponds to the 2 8-day measure of the Thirteen Moon calendar.

THE RINRI PROJECT Described as a \"four-year telepathic biosphere-noosphere transition Circumpolar Rainbow Bridge Experiment,\" the Rinri Project builds on the Telektonon play that establishes the biotelepathic circuit. On this circuit, two towers, days 1 and 6, define a four-day Earth Walk, and two towers, days 23 and 28, define a four-day Heaven Walk. Between the second and the third towers, days 6 and 23, are the sixteen posi- tions of the Cube of the Law, days 7-22. The four towers every Moon correspond to one radial set of four Galactic Activation Portals in the Harmonic Module-thirteen moons x four towers = 52 Galactic Activation Portals (GAPs). Sixteen cube positions each moon x 13 Moons = 208, the remaining number of kin in the Harmonic Mod- ule once the 52 GAPs have been subtracted from the 260 units. Since the Harmonic Module is the basis of the psi bank, this formulation provides a way of coordinating the four psi bank plates of the noosphere to the Thirteen Moon calendar year on a daily and annual basis. Since there are four plates, it takes four years, one year per plate, to open the psi bank. The first opening occurred between 1996-2000. The second opening, 2000- 2004, is now occurring and is programmed by a coordination of the twenty-four runes of the Elder Futhark to the twenty-four psi membranes-6 runes per week every Moon x four weeks = 24. Since each psi plate is a mirror symmetry pair of Harmonic Modules, reflecting the North and South magnetic poles of the Earth, the Rinri project is practiced by telepathically interactive teams in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The Rainbow Bridge refers to making visible the dynamic of Earth's electromagnetic aura and extending it permanently from pole to pole. This is how the noosphere is visibly manifest. Rinri is a Japanese word meaning \"ethical enlightenment,\" and its application includes seventeen moral precepts that are studied during the sixteen-day cube jour- ney, the seventeenth corresponding to the tower day 23. 260 POSTULATES OF THE DYNAMICS OF TIME While the Telektonon is predicated on the fourth-dimensional tool kit, the Dream- spell, the 260 Postulates of the Dynamics of Time elaborate on the nature and theory of the biosphere-noosphere transition by providing a set of twenty systematic Making the Transition to the New Time. 17 1"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"172 thirteen-part logics that describe and define the dynamics of time as the evolution of consciousness.

This daily programming, established by the Telektonon practice is how knowledge is reformatted according to the synchronic order. This in itself precipitates the noosphere. TWENTY TABLETS OF THE LAW OF TIME, SIXTEEN-YEAR CUBE OF THE LAW The Twenty Tablets can be described as a road map of the fourth dimension. By focusing on a sequence between the years 1997-2013, by fractal analogies, the tele- pathic engagement encompasses the 26,000-year cycle as well as the coming cycle of the Psychozoic future. The crux of the daily play of the synchronic order is called cubing the codon. The point is to telepathically reharmonize the DNA that has been adversely affected by the 12:60 timing frequency. There are sixty-four DNA co dons whose six-part binary structure is identical to that of the sixty-four hexagrams of the I Ching when both are written with a simple binary language of broken or unbroken lines. Each of the co dons establishes a precise thirteen-stage permutation sequence. 64 x 13 = 832 codon permutations. The sixteen years from 1997 to 2013 also consti- tute 832 weeks (16 x 52 = 832 = 64 x 13). Therefore, each codon has one-quarter year, thirteen weeks, to run its permutation sequence, one sequence per week. Since each codon consists of six lines, each week the codon is built one line per day for six days, each line adhering to one side of a cube. On the seventh day, the codon is cubed and sealed by one of sixty-four \"UR Runes.\" The UR Runes are the master cosmic runes, each of which governs an entire thirteen-unit codon permutation se- quence. The Twenty Tablets also contain much synchronic information for experi- encing what is referred to as fractal time compression, the expanded mental ability to engage in different planes or levels of time simultaneously. All of this is to establish a mind training for fully engaging the fourth-dimensional synchronic order of real- ity and time travel. 7:7::7:7 TELEKTONON REVELATION While the Twenty Tablets of the Cube of the Law synchronize the DNA Codons in all their permutations on a weekly basis over a sixteen-year cycle, the 7:7::7:7 Telektonon Revelation establishes the 28-day cycle as the basis for synchronizing .

The Peace Plan: Establishing the Pax Cultura, Pax Biospherica From the time of the formation, or rather, the calling into existence of the World Thirteen Moon Calendar Change Peace Movement, there had to be a World Thir- teen Moon Calendar Change Peace Plan. The original of this Plan was submitted to the United Nations in 1995 for its fiftieth anniversary. The crux of the Peace Plan is that to change the world standard calendar is the opportunity for humanity to stop in its tracks and redirect itself. By stopping in its tracks to change its timing frequency, humanity can also use the opportunity to call a universal cease-fire and declare an emergency peace worldwide. Only in this way can the new time be experienced and fully engaged. At the First Planetary Congress of Biospheric Rights (1996), this Peace Plan was extended to include the establishment of a new human covenant that would restore to humanity its intrinsic biospheric rights, the same as enjoyed by the rest oflife in the biosphere: free land, clean air, clean water. The premise of the Biospheric Covenant is that humanity is first and foremost a member of the biosphere, and not of any artificially constituted nation-state. The Biospheric Congress also mandated the revival of the Banner of Peace and Roerich Peace Pact (1935) as one of the emblems to be used to identify the biosphere as a zone of peace. The World Congress on the Law of Time and Judgment Day Tribunal (1997) extended the Biospheric Congress to include an indictment of the Gregorian calen- dar as a crime against the biosphere-\"the crime of the millennium\"-and the es- tablishment of the Law of Time, inclusive of the Twenty Tablets, as the new dispen- sation of knowledge awarded in compensation to humanity, based on the synchronic veracity of the Thirteen Moon Calendar Change Peace Plan. By 1999, the World Summit on Peace and Time provided the Declaration of Calendar Reform and a set of People's Resolutions, which were presented to the United Nations and the Vatican. The Resolutions define a seven-part educational program, which, like the Biospheric Covenant, envisions a radical reorganization of human society. The purpose of these documents and declarations is for the creation of a state of universal unconditional peace so that human society can be rebuilt as a harmonic unity in phase with the biosphere as a whole. The result of the Thirteen Moon Calendar Change Peace Plan would be the creation of a new order oflife on Earth- the Pax Cultura, Pax Biospherica.

If this is the ultimate ruling body of the planet, and the reason why they are the ruling body is their possession of these instruments of death, then why should anyone be surprised at the existence of \"terrorists\" in the rest of the world? And why, we may ask again, are these terrorists mostly, it would seem, from the Islamic world? In addition to the nuclear arsenals, there are the biological and chemical weapons of mass destruction. Those who live by the manufacture of terror must surely die by their own means. If other nations have developed the same sys- tems of terror, it is only in self-defense or in imitation of the masters of terror. Everyday for four weeks now, I have been waking up at this time to continue work on this text, Time and the Technosphere. I had at first thought that the book could be complete with eight chapters. People don't have time to read, and the topic war- rants as brief and pithy an explanation as possible. After all, it is really a time of reflection-and then action. The masters of terror have cloaked themselves as the protectors of civilization and as the moral crusaders who will rid the world of evil. Yet what is civilization today but the resource-consuming cancer of the biosphere? Is this what is being protected-the right to promote the disease upon the biosphere? The terrorists who attacked the Twin Towers and the Pentagon clearly knew the symbolic and actual value of their targets. They also undoubtedly knew the depths of the death-fear of the superpower masters of terror, whose reaction would most likely foment a global war. But in such a war, who would win? In this regard, from the noospheric perspective, the Inevitable Event was the technocide-death by technospheric means-of the technosphere itself. The technosphere was created by and thrived on means of terror, and the means of massive terror as well as the eco- nomic imperialism perpetrated by the superpower managers of the technosphere could only have produced a reaction against itself known as terrorism. The end re- sult is collective suicide. There are no flags in the blood of the dead, nor is there any evident religious belief. There is only human biomass ultimately indistinguishable and anonymous to the biosphere.

Yes, eight chapters were necessary to unfold this analysis and solution. But I knew there had to be a ninth chapter for the testament to be complete. For this is a living testament, and if anything has been learned by living according to the synchronic order of fourth- dimensional time, it is the renewed power of number itself. There is a power and meaning to number understood as a universal, self-existing mental construct. The synchronic order is constructed of number. And as Pythagoras perceived, number is a kind of spiritual entity that can only be aroused by an act of meditative contempla- tion. Each whole number bears its own resonance. You can feel this in the contem- plation of the difference between even and odd numbers. The resonance of 8, an even number, is harmonic order and balance, geometri- cally evident in the octagon or the octahedron. But the resonance of9, an odd num- ber, is quite different. Nine months to give birth, three times three, a rhythmic tri- plicity-that is nine. The Germanic god-hero Odin, or Votan, spent nine nights hanging from a tree in order to gain knowledge of the mys- teries of woman. When the tomb of Pacal Votan was opened on June 15, 1952, it revealed a large vaulted chamber beneath the pyramid of the inscriptions in Palenque, Chiapas, Mexico. Entering the tomb, in the center of which is the famous sarcophagus, one sees on the walls the beautifully sculpted figures of nine personages. Today these sculptures have almost completely worn away. But originally, these low-relief sculptures modeled out oflime- stone, depicted with great elegance, a series of figures commonly known as the Nine Lords of Night, or the Nine Lords of Time. Are the Nine Lords of Time, the Lords of Night who guard Pacal Votan in his tomb, the same as the nine nights of OdinIVotan? And who was Pacal Votan? With what mythic resonance are we dealing?

How ingenious, how uncanny, that it would have been unknown for 1,260 years-a number also known in the thirteenth chapter of the Book of Revelations as the number of days of exile of the woman clothed with the sun, her feet on the moon, and twelve stars around her head. What does this allegory mean? Is it not the same as the exile of the human soul in the deadening world of 12:60 materialism? Sixty years remained from the opening of that mysteri- ous tomb to the closing of the cycle of history, the omega point of 2012. How could the timing of the opening of the tomb have occurred so precisely-1,2 60 years from dedication to discovery, 1,320 years from its dedication to the closing of the cycle? How could those years be such a perfect reflection of the artificial 12:60 and the natural 13:20 timing frequencies? How could a Mayan sage in Central America so long ago be able to see, it would seem, into our future? When we study the globe and consider things synchronically from the perspec- tive of the noosphere, we find some interesting correspondences. Pacal Votan lived in the tenth baktun cycle, between the Christian years 603-683, on the opposite side of the world but at almost the same latitude as Mecca, and just after the time of Muhammad, 570-632. Today the religion that God commanded Muhammad to found, Islam, is at the center of the terrorist storm, while the prophecy of Pacal Votan and of the Mayan calendar in general has placed the end point of history at 2012, a mere eleven years after the Inevitable Event that placed Islam at dead center of the world mind. How could this be, the religion of the prophet Muhammad and the prophetic timing of the Maya so close at hand? Is this some revelation of the Nine Lords of Time, or of God speaking through them-and who are the Nine Lords of Time? Are they destined to return? Could it be that the Nine Lords of Time, like some higher dimensional Lords of the Ring, are a manifestation of time to be released, one by one, in an annual sequence during the last nine years of the Great Cycle, 2004-2013? These Nine Lords of Time are known in Mayan as the Bolontiku; their counter- parts are the Oxlahuntiku-the nine lords and the thirteen lords, respectively. The nine lords govern the underworld, the time of the third dimension, which is why they are depicted in descent to the sarcophagus of Pacal Votan, while the thirteen lords govern the heavenly realms. The nine govern the nine vigesimal orders of number, while the thirteen govern the form of time.

This prophecy refers to the sequence of twenty-two 52- year cycles that began in A.D. 843 and ended in A.D. 1987. Six years later, in 1993, during the first year of the 260th and final katun cycle of history, I began to decode the prophecy ofPacal Votan, some forty-one years after the tomb had been opened. Telektonon, the Prophecy of Pacal Votan, was meant to be decoded precisely and only at the moment of its absolute usefulness, kin 144: Yellow Magnetic Seed, July 26, 1993. This moment defined the Seven Years of Prophecy, 1993-2000. It also established the validity of the Dreamspell or WIzard's Count as the reformulated Year- Bearer Count of the Chilam Balam, the jaguar priests or night seers. That is, the Telektonon Prophecy could only have been triggered when kin 144 occurred as the Year Bearer, Yellow Magnetic Seed, kin 144, correlated to the Gregorian date of July 26, 1993. The precise revelation of this prophecy on kin 144, July 26, 1993, was dependent on and could only have occurred because a prophetic count, the WIzard's Count, de- rived from the prophetic tradition of the Chilam Balam, had already been established. This \"count\" provided the basis of The Mayan Factor and was woven into the conclu- sion of the Prophecy of the Thirteen Heavens and Nine Hells, Harmonic Conver- gence, August 16-17, 1987. And the precise number of kin 144, the revelation date of the prophecy of Pacal Votan was meant to accord with the Book of Revelations num- ber of the elect, 144,000 (Revelations 7 :4). In fact, that very day I discovered that the number 144 transliterated from the vigesimal count into Arabic numbers is written 7.4, which is the same as the chapter and verse number where the 144,000 are first mentioned in the Book of Revelations (7 = 140, or 7 x 20, plus 4 units = 7.4). More uncanny stuff-but not so to the noosphere, the Earth's mind of time. In the noosphere everything is woven of number, and number is intrinsically synchronizing, which is why numerology has held such a fascination for the human mind throughout history. When I first began to decode this \"final prophecy of the Maya,\" or Telektonon, a prophecy that commands the return to natural time through the Thirteen Moon! 28- Day calendar, I was stunned and not a little frightened. I had already taken many steps to remove myself from mainstream society and conventional life. But now I was dealing with a genuine prophecy, and I was to be its messenger. This was not my invention. The world is filled with enough madmen and lunatics spouting their par- ticular visions. How could I ever make the world understand that this vision, this prophecy, was real, that it was the fulfillment of a Mayan who lived and died thirteen 182 . The Advent of the Noosphere"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"centuries ago, and that his tomb was the vehicle of this prophecy, a prophecy meant precisely for this moment in time-the biosphere-noosphere transition? I returned to the texts of the Chilam Balam, whose prophetic stream includes day prophecies, year prophecies, katun (twenty year), and ahau (260-year) cycle proph- ecies, prophecies of Quetzalcoatl, and finally the special prophecies of the mysteri- ous Antonio Martinez and the coming religion of the Hunab Ku, \"One Giver of Movement and Measure.\" I realized that the meaning and fulfillment of this entire prophetic stream was crystallized in the Harmonic Convergence and its 26-year aftermath. Chilam Balam, the jaguar priests, are the wizards of time, inspired by the guidance of the Bolontiku, the Nine Lords of Time, the Lords of Number. By com- mand of the Supreme One (Hunab Ku), the wizards are directed to establish clear paths of rekindled knowledge. The ancient Maya prophesied their own destruction. Therefore, within the prophecies of the Chilam Balam they laid the seeds of their reconstruction-but not simply as Maya. The reconstruction had to be planetary, for their destruction in the sixteenth century was also an act of planetary conse- quence-the plunging of the entire world into the prison of artificial, mechanized time. The fulfillment of the prophecies along with the new dispensation of time had to occur before the end of the cycle, 2012. For this reason, the master synchronic architect of the Mayan prophets, Pacal Votan, prepared the way with the discovery of his tomb in 1952. This phenomenal act of prophetic release meant that now the messenger of his prophecy of time had to be summoned to his task. This was to be my role and responsibility-one that I accepted, for I saw no other choice.

The noosphere had found another chip. After all, if the noosphere is the mind of time on Earth, prophecy is just another way of radializing time, of bringing it around from one point in a cyclic motion to an- other.

Once I had received knowledge of the prophecy of the Thirteen Heavens and Nine Hells from Tony Shearer back around 1970, I prepared myself by study and medita- tion for the moment of the Harmonic Convergence.

First of all, the Harmonic Convergence refers to the entire 26-year cycle from White Galactic WIzard to Yellow Galactic Seed, 1987-2013. The conclusion of the Ninth Hell refers to the release of humanity into the 26-year time zone of free will, choice, and decision in preparation for the completion of the cycle, omega point 2012, and the Galactic Synchronization, 2013. The full and true Harmonic Convergence will not be complete until the Earth itself becomes the Galactic Seed, 2013. If the twenty-six years are the free will zone of choice and decision, what are we to choose and decide? The choice is, as I was quoted in the TVtlll Street Journal in 1987, \" between a 'new age' and all-out destruction.\" The decision is to accept the knowledge of the error in time (12:60) and the choice is to return to natural time (13:20) by means of the Thirteen Moon!28-Day calendar. This the prophecy ofPacal Votan fully affirms. In principle, the Harmonic Convergence refers to the converging of all aspects of reality in a great, all-unifying harmony. The initial moment of the Harmonic Convergence that witnessed hundreds of thousands of humans congregated at sa- cred sites worldwide at the dawn of August 16, 1987, Blue Electric Eagle, was a pure prophetic enactment of humanity being harmonically converged with the natural order of time. This visionary moment demonstrated that, indeed, Harmonic Con- vergence was possible. The wave of unconscious energy released through the collec- tive psyche of the species as a result of this moment of prophetic purity reached a climax with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War. Early 1990, the role of the Harmonic Convergence in this process was echoed in the mass media as the question, \"Did the Harmonic Convergence bring the world closer to peace?\"l Before the question could be answered, the next phase of the prophetic end time began to unfold. Rather than determine how to make the choice to enter a genuine new age, the human race defaulted to an absolute materialism. It was this collective turn taken by the planetary leadership, now known as the G-7, that engendered the apoca- lypse we are now witnessing. In this turn, the Harmonic Convergence was forgotten, deleted as it were from the official public texts of contemporary history. The stage was thus set for the next revelation, the Telektonon of Pacal Votan. In distinguishing the Seven Years of Prophecy, 1993-2000, Magnetic Seed- Resonant WIzard years, the Telektonon of Pacal Votan makes an absolutely clear analysis of the human condition at this time: unless the human race forsakes the false time governed by the instruments of the Gregorian calendar and the mechanical clock by the year 2000, then it will face its own destruction, biospheric collapse, and Hell on Earth. But ifby the year 2000 it can make the decision to reject the calendar of the false 18 4 . .

For the new age, so longed for, is actually only realizable as a new time. A new time can only come about by the rejection of the instrument that holds in place the hallucination of the old time, replacing it instead with an instru- ment of such perfect harmony that it has no history, but is truly post-historical. For this, the messengers of time, myself and my wife, embarked on a course of being galactic gypsies, with no visible means of support, in order to warn the world of the meaning of the time and to offer to the world the opportunity of changing its course by changing its calendar. When the year 2000 rolled around, humanity re- mained unmoved. The Gregorian calendar, the Vatican, and the G-7 appeared to be as strong as ever. The prophecy did not fail, but humanity did fail to heed the mes- sage regarding artificial and natural time. In this process, as \"messengers\" my wife and I were only playing out an archetypal role. So beginning with the Blue Galactic Storm year, July 26,2000, thirteen years after the White Galactic WIzard year, hu- manity was placed in judgment. This is merely a matter of natural karmic law. The four-year cycle, 2000-2004, became known as the prophetic cycle of the Har- rowing of Hell. Just as Jesus was crucified and then experienced the Harrowing of Hell before his resurrection, so too humanity has been crucified on the technospheric cross of false time, and is now in the Harrowing of Hell awaiting the resurrection in natural time. For having failed to take seriously all its messengers and all its prophets of all times, humanity was now to pass en masse through hell. Since the Galactic Storm year, 2000-2001, completed a Seed-Storm Year bundle begun in the fifth year of proph- ecy (1997-1998), the 2000-2001 Blue Galactic Storm year was the year of evaluation. The full judgment was withheld until the Solar Seed Year, 2001-2002. The Solar Seed year is the second year of the Harrowing of Hell, but the first year of the next four-year Seed-Storm Year bundle. The first half of the Yellow Solar Seed occurs during the second half of the first official year of the third millennium, 2001. The moment was now ripe for the Inevitable Event, for it was also the same Gregorian calendar year as 1945 and 1973. In the Telektonon Prophecy, verse 120, section 19, it is declared, \"When the Lunar Moon has overflowed its banks, the G-7 will be no more.\" So it was on the twentieth day of the Lunar Moon (Blue Self- existing Monkey, galactic signature of Karl Marx), that the Tower of Babel, the World Trade Center, was struck a fatal blow, while the Pentagon, magical structure of the priests of the Dark Lords of Matter, built in \"Hell's Bottom,\" Arlington, Virginia, during the Ninth Hell cycle, was mortally penetrated. It is still the time of the Harmonic Convergence. The Harrowing of Hell The Advent of the Noosphere . 185"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"represents the last cycle of respite for humanity. By July 26,2004, Blue Crystal Storm, humanity must make the \"choice between a 'new age' and all-out destruction\" when it will have the last opportunity to make the decision of rejecting the old time and calendar and replacing it altogether with the instrument of perfect harmony, the Thirteen Moon!28-Day synchronometer. Only such a harmonic organizing prin- ciple, universally accepted and applied, can ensure a time of harmony and the fulfill- ment of the Harmonic Convergence. Is it possible that within the noosphere the Harmonic Convergence is awaiting its next climax on the Day Out of Time and the Thirteen Moon Synchronization date of the year 2004, that is, on Gregorian July 25 and 26, 2004? One reads through the Journal of Calendar Reform and the many texts and arguments for calendar re- form that were put forth in the 1930s and feels the missed opportunity. Even Gandhi was in favor of a new universal timing standard as a principle means of unifying humanity in peace. Did World War II occur because the League of Nations failed to enact the calendar reform on January 1, 1933, as it had fully proposed? The League of Nations had promoted calendar reform as one of its major agendas since the 1920s. This world organization failed at calendar reform and at preventing World War II. Who or what prevented that reform from happening, and why? Let us look at the matter again. In order to remain constant, any perpetual cal- endar ordered by the seven-day week requires the principle of a null day, a Day Out of Time that is no day of the week at all. This was a feature of the preferred Thirteen Moon!28-Day calendar proposed by the International Chamber of Commerce, as well as the other modified calendars of twelve months. Reading through archives and literature, pro and con, it is clear that what defeated the calendar reform was the conservative, Vatican-inspired objection to the null day, the Day Out of Time. To observe such a day, which is no day of the week at all, it was argued, would break the weekly succession of days set in motion by God at the beginning of creation-such a break would plunge the world into barbarism, chaos, and war. \"The adoption of the weekly cycle was a triumph of Christianity to the detriment of paganism. The cult of Christianity is inextricably connected to the week whose origin reaches to the dawn of history. \"2 Therefore, it was contended, to interrupt this weekly succession would destroy Christianity itself. As a result of such propaganda, the League of Nations faltered, no calendar reform occurred at all, and the world was plunged into war-a war that ended with the beginning of the age of terror. This terror is now running its course, like a fever sweeping through the biosphere. WIll it be possible to consider again what the League of Nations faltered on and what the United Nations simply chose to ignore? 186 . The Advent of the Noosphere"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Who really lost out when the calendar reform issue was tabled in 1956 at the United Nations? It was not God who invented the week as we know it, but more likely the Babylonians. Behind the week is the mystery of the whole number seven, recalled in the Epic of Gilgamesh as the seven wise men ofU ruk. But the Babylonians clothed the seven-day cycle in the raiment of the sun, moon, and five principle plan- ets-Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn-to which the days of the week have no actual relation. Seen in this way, the seven-day week was intended to be a means on Earth for reenacting some remote mythic reality related to these seven heavenly bodies. What was that mythic reality, on what hidden knowledge is the count of the seven-day week presumed? Borrowing from Babylon, the ancient Hebrews incorpo- rated the seven-day week into their purely lunar calendar. And it was thus from the Hebrews that the seven-day week entered the Julian and then the Gregorian calen- dars. It was not, however, the Romans who adopted the week, but the Christian successor to the Roman empire, the Church of Rome. What truly was the origin of the week? And what relation or meaning does it have in the first place? Even to F. H. Colson, a Christian scholar writing as late as 1926, the seven-day cycle is described as \"that intruder the week, consisting indeed of a fixed number of days, but paying no regard to months or years.\"3 With its fixed number of days, the week makes sense only in a system of time reckoning that is synchronic rather than astronomical in nature. To those whose minds are set on the synodic lunation cycle as the absolute standard, as does the Gregorian calendar, the week is what ensures the greatest disorder in the calendar- and yet it is defended to the death. The week gains its power from the whole number 7, and not from the jumble of names in which the week is clothed. The seven-day cycle is the closest whole number that corresponds to the four phases of the moon, which, as whole numbers, are also seven days each. In fact, the fixed 7-day cycle only makes sense within the context of the Thirteen Moon calendar with its 28-day cycles divisible by four and seven, creating the annual cycle of fifty-two perfect weeks-plus the Day Out of Time, ensuring a perpetual harmony. Was the Babylonian naming of these days-with only one name a reference to the moon-meant to be a cover-up of some earlier knowledge, a knowledge both more purely lunar and harmonic, such as the Thirteen Moon calendar? Is all of history, then, just based on a cover-up of harmonic time? What would really happen if there were a Day Out of Time, no day of the week or month at all? Would old belief systems dissolve? Would there be a psychic release, a sense of freedom?

All the while, the Gregorian world has arrogantly plunged blindly forward, locked into its mechanistically chaotic timing sensibility, only to receive the mortal wound of the Inevitable Event, causing it to fall through the seams of its own making, the technosphere. A Day Out of Time, it seems, might be a relief to a world now consumed by chaos, barbarism, and war. He sends down from the sky water for your drink and to grow trees for your benefit. With it He grows for you crops, olives, date palms, grapes, and all kinds of fruits. This is sufficient proof for people who think. And He commits, in your service, the night and the day, as well as the sun and the moon. Also, the stars are committed by His command. These are sufficient proofs for people who understand. (Quran, 16:10-12) Yes, the biosphere is a set of proofs for people who understand, an immense order that reflects and transforms the cosmos through the very process of life on Earth. Who are the people who understand, and where are those people today? Who will speak for the biosphere? Who will take the message of the advent of the noosphere to the statesmen and the politicians that they may take heed and note that what is occurring is not really in their control at all, but is the climax of a phenom- enal process known as biogeochemical combustion? And who will declare that this climax will inevitably shake all the towers to their foundations and level the moun- tains of industry to a flat plain from which the noosphere will manifest as the equal- ity of telepathy for all? This book, and this ninth chapter in particular, is like a long meditation, a vision, inspired by the dark tragedy of the Inevitable Event. As a vision, these thoughts are both those of one solitary individual, albeit a noospheric chip, and the continuation of the vision of that ancient seer, Pacal Votan. Could it be that Pacal Votan in his time knowledge rehearsed all these words, these thoughts, this entire vision itself? On the sarcophagus lid of Pacal Votan is a cross, not the cross of death as in Chris- tianity, but the cross oflife, a tree, a cosmic tree. Across that tree is a serpentine band with two dragonlike heads, one at each end. This band represents the galaxy. The head at each end represents the galactic vision that sees equally into the past and the future. Sometimes this is called the zuvuya, the reflex of cosmic memory. The entire galaxy, the Milky Way, is this reflex of cosmic memory. What if all of humanity is meant to be opened into this cosmic memory?

Because we are now defining the noosphere does not mean that the noosphere was not known to those ancient Mayan time scientists like Pacal Votan, especially if the noosphere is defined as the mind of time on Earth. To such time scientists a NET year would be no time at all, or rather, it would be but a single, fifty-two solar orbit rehearsal of life. How many such rehearsals would be necessary before some- thing was finally learned? The Prophecy of Thirteen Heavens and Nine Hells, for instance, was actually just the passage of twenty-two NET years. Is this how long was needed to see if the human race would learn anything? And if Pacal Votan and Muhammad were around today, what would they think and do? Knowing the nature of the synchronic order of time, someone like Pacal Votan, obviously one of the most singular of all personalities of the Mayan world, would have possessed a consciousness like the two-headed galactic band, the consciousness of ga- lactic memory. In the zuvuya of galactic consciousness, peering into the deep past is peering at the present from the future. This is possible in the radial time of the fourth dimension freed from the strict linear construct of past-and-future-time. From some higher state of mind, from a mind and consciousness identified completely with the galaxy, this has all been foreseen, this has all been written in a book. Now we who are in this present state of end-time consciousness are being asked to self-reflect. We are being asked if we can manage to hold the noospheric lens steady enough to see that the technosphere had to end, and that the technosphere could only end by the means by which it maintained all of the biosphere in its control, by terror itself. Yes, we are all a bit like the frog at the bottom of the well whose vision and perception of the universe is circumscribed by what the opening of the well allows it to see. The well is the technosphere, both as a planetary apparatus and as a belief system. On the other side of that well is a vast world that we have actually never seen. This vast world is the noosphere and beyond. And what is beyond? Many of the traditional peoples say that we originally came from the stars. If we came from the stars, are the star people still out there? And what do the star people think of all that is happening on Earth today? And what do they think of their lost star children, many of whom now believe it is childish to think that we came from the stars? And if there are star people still out there, wouldn't they be too sophisticated to think they could get anywhere in a rocket ship, or even a UFO, subject to the en tropic degrada- tion of the material plane?

This being so, we could receive telepathic messages from the star people-if we were ready for it and knew precisely why, when, and how such communication occurs. In fact, as we have said earlier, the noosphere is the region on Earth for the receipt and transmission of messages of cosmic consciousness. This being so, the future of human evolution, of Homo noosphericus, would be nothing less than to become a medium of cosmic con- sciousness, adapting to the expanded measure of Noospheric Earth Time, traveling back to the stars but through the superior knowledge of the actual laws of time. In writing this book, I have only a sense of duty, of responsibility to expand the vision of my fellow earthlings from the technosphere to the noosphere. In the Law of Time there are no arbitrary distinctions between reason and art, science and proph- ecy. The universe really is a giant radio transmitter. This book is as much an exposi- tion of matters generally not thought about, as it is a personal testament and vision. In that regard this text is a portion of a broadcast transduced and received by me functioning as a noospheric chip, on behalf of the biosphere-noosphere transition. In the tomb lid ofPacal Votan are impressed all the frequencies of this broadcast transmission called Time and the Technosphere. I know that Pacal Votan took an earthly form for just this purpose. He left his body in that tomb, a jade mask being the actual impression of his face. According to Chinese and ancient Mexican tradition, jade is the stone of immortality. Was Pacal Votan an immortal? Where did his conscious- ness and spirit go once his body was placed in the sarcophagus? Why did he leave the Telektonon, the Earth Spirit Speaking Tube, running from the tomb to the temple floor at the top of the Pyramid of the Inscriptions? Knowing the frequency of the synchronic order governing the psi bank of the mental envelope of the Earth, did he place his thoughts in the noosphere to be released at the precise moments of the opening of his tomb and the decoding of his prophecy? And then where did he go? Beginning in 1980 I became conscious that, from time to time, I had been re- ceiving telepathic transmissions. I soon identified these transmissions as coming from the star Arcturus. In Earth Ascending, originally written in 1983, the nature and pro- gram of the psi bank, the control panel and regulating mechanism of the noosphere, became known to me. This was followed by The Mayan Factor, and then the decod- ing of the Law of Time. At the moment when I had just finished writing The Mayan Factor in 1986, I received the inspiration for what is called the planet holon, the twenty-part structure accommodating the program of the twenty solar seals. When I received this image it was known to me as the program of the Arcturus Protector- ate. As I understood it, the Arcturus Protectorate was established by the \"star people\" as a kind of protective time shield around the Earth. By means of the activation of 190 . The Advent of the Noosphere"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"this time shield, the star people would know that some of the earthlings were waking up to time and beginning the conscious activation of the noosphere. This is exactly what came about through the Dreamspell, beginning in 1990. The Dreamspell is such a radical break from the past, and such a pure statement of the history-less fourth-dimensional future, that in order to comprehend it, in 1992 I wrote two other books, one called the Arcturus Probe: Tales and Reports of an Ongoing Investigation and the other The Call ofPacal Votan: Time is the Fourth Dimen- sion. Some people will say that the Arcturus Probe is an exaggerated fantasy, yet I cannot deny what a purely telepathic process it was to write that book, which fills in many points of the psychomythic cosmology of Dreamspell: The Journey of Timeship Earth 2013. The Call of Pacal Votan was originally titled A Treatise on Time Viewed from its Own Dimension, and is a purely scientific description of the mathematical codes of the Dreamspell in relation to the biosphere-noosphere transition. The one text purely imaginal, the other purely rational, yet both were two sides of the same coin, a rendering of the Law of Time in its cosmological and mathematical compre- hensiveness. Then came the even more abrupt break with my conventional past, the Telektonon Prophecy of Pacal Votan. I bring up all of these personal details because people often ask where it all came from and where I got my ideas. But more importantly, I bring them up because, as I have been indicating, all of this was foreseen and known by a seer in another time, in another world-Pacal Votan. And this process of one person hid- ing a prophecy and another person in another time finding that prophecy, this is also a further revelation of how the noosphere functions. The French mathemati- cian and philosopher Charles Henry (1859-1926) declared, \"As the individual be- comes more collective, the collective becomes more individual.\"4 As individuals, we humans are meant to grow into the collective mind known as the noosphere, while the noosphere, which is the collective, could only be known through its incorporating itself through the individual. I am one such individual, a noospheric chip. The noosphere could not be understood if it did not take on a personality or a number of personalities. Otherwise the noosphere would remain in the purely theoretical state or condition. Now that the Inevitable Event has occurred, the noosphere is recruiting. The program of recruitment is called the Campaign for the New Time. This is a genuine campaign, but a peace campaign and not a military one. As a campaign it must reach its climax by mid-2004, a full eight years before the end of the cycle, northern win- ter/southern summer solstice 2012, the noosphere's omega point. The reason for this is that any later than 2004, the prophecy will be negatively fulfilled.

This is no longer a matter of debate. There is no other solution that hasn't been tried. There is no other way that the noosphere can become collectively conscious than through the human adoption of a timing system of perfect harmony.

Such is the advent of the noosphere. What did the Maya foresee for 2012? What is Pacal Votan's vision? Pacal Votan's vision is the fulfillment of a prayer-a prayer that I have heard through the silence: o Hunab Ku, One Giver of Movement and Measure, be kind to the children of this Earth. We see how every year you give and how every year you take away. This is so the children of Earth can learn to be free and dwell only in your presence. Yet we know that the children of the Earth must undergo their lessons as well. And we know that they must enter the dark time of testing. 0 Hunab Ku, in their time of darkness, in their time of forgetting, do not forget them, spare those who are good, if you can. Prepare for them the Second Creation you have promised to the righ- teous among them. Break for them the spell of false time before they destroy this Earth! And show to them the splendors of the Second Creation, of the New Heaven and the New Earth. Show them these wonders before the Great Cycle is finished, so that they may yet wake up from the sleep of time. And 0 Hunab Ku, may the nine great Lords of Time return to Earth! May they teach the children of the Earth how to become a race of wizards, tilling the noosphere as they have tilled the Earth. 0 bring to these children of the Earth a good Time, a Time of Peace as long, at least, as was their time of history and war, and then let that Time of Peace be multiplied sevenfold! And here is the vision that fulfills the prayer: Planet Earth, Rhythmic Solstice, Blue Resonant Storm year, 2012 Omega Point. The Earth's axis is tilted so that the North Pole is at its farthest from the sun, and the South Pole is at its closest. High above the Earth an iridescent, thin rainbow band 192 .

The Earth slowly rotates beneath these two rainbow bands that remain unchanging, constant in their positions, one of them directly opposite the sun, the other holding a position on the midnight side of the Earth's turning. The band facing the sun is the Earth's day alternator. The other band is the Earth's night alternator. If we glide across the surface of the Earth we see that everywhere there are small encampments, circular and radial in formation. Yurts, tents, adobe, and earthen structures-and gardens. The once-teeming cities are eerily silent, yet still inhabited, though with far fewer people than during the time of the technosphere. And everywhere in the small encampments people are reverentially gathered. This is the moment of the closing of the cycle. It is as if everyone is draw- ing in a single breath at the same time, and exhaling it at the same time. From wherever you are, even though there are clouds, you can see the shimmering irides- cent rainbow alternator, either by day or by night. Clusters of people are gathered in circles of deep meditation. Around them the children laugh and play. \"We are the noosphere,\" a voice is repeating, \"we are the noosphere.\" This sets up a vibration and people everywhere stop in their tracks, they look toward the sky. They listen. \"The galaxy is renewing our thought. The galaxy is renewing our mind. The galaxy is renewing our world, this Earth. Let us go home and learn some more.\" Drums and chanting fade into the twilight in one place and beckon the dawn in another. \"Let us say the prayer again: '0 Hunab Ku, Allah, One Maker, Our Creator, we submit to You.

Thank you for the closing of the cycle! May what we have learned stay with us and become the inherit- ance of our children for seven times seven generations to come, and may you bring us another cycle for all our descendants to live in continuing peace and harmony!'\" This is the vision.

The Law of Time asserts that the actual nature of time is synchronic; hence the purpose of calen- dars is to synchronize us in time according to various cycles whose harmonic num- bers extend from and return us to a higher mental order of reality. It is a fatal error to dismiss a mathematics of harmonic perfection when it is allied with the ordering and comprehension of cycles. The pursuit of a true and accurate year totally subordi- nates the cyclic nature of time to the ceaseless imperfection and change that charac- terize the phenomenal world when it is considered as the sole factor of existence. This defines the thoroughly materialist worldview of the 12:60 consciousness. In order to prepare the ground for a proper consideration of the Law of Time and the evolutionary necessity of the synchronic order of time as the harmonic reor- ganizing factor of humanity in its post-historic phase, it is necessary to expunge from the mind the error known as the Gregorian calendar. To demonstrate and expose the illogical and irrational nature of the Gregorian calendar as a standard of 200 . Summary Critique"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"measure, the following seven points are presented as a simple appeal to the intrinsic logic and intelligence of any human being. 1. We require of a standard of measure that its units of measure are regular and equal with one another. This is not the case with the Gregorian calendar, whose base unit of measure, the month, proceeds in an irregular and uneven manner: 31 days, 28 days, 31 days, 30 days, 31 days, 30 days, 31 days, 31 days, 30 days, 31 days, 30 days, and 31 days. Why would anyone use a standard of measure with irregular units? Do you know what results when a crooked standard of measure is employed consistently for millennia? It might be noted that at the time of Augustus Caesar, August was called Sextile and had thirty days, while February then had twenty-nine days. In order to honor Augustus and make him the equal ofJulius Ouly) which had thirty-one days, the twenty-ninth day was taken from February and added on to Sextile, whose name was then changed to Augustus (August). By harmonic contrast, the Thirteen Moon calendar is per- petual in that all of its units of measure are equal-28 days each. 2. The names of the months are as illogical as their uneven numbering. January is derived from the God of the doorway; February is an obscure word refer- ring to an animal divinatory rite; March refers to Mars, the planet and the god of war; April and May refer to goddesses of the spring; June to the wife of Jupiter; July and August are named after the two most prominent Roman Emperors, Julius and Augustus Caesar. As for the remaining months, September, the ninth month, means seven; Oc- tober, the tenth month, means eight; November, the eleventh month, means nine; and December, the twelfth month, means ten. Of course, having grown habituated to the crooked standard of measure, it is easy to overlook and dismiss as innocuous the irra- tional naming of the months. But is it so innocuous? What do the names of these months have to do with an order of time, or even a cosmology or culture of time, which we assume a calendar might reflect? By blindly accepting this irrational disorder of names, do we not predispose ourselves to accept irrational disorder in common- place things around us, and even within the fabric of our society, thus reinforcing in us a tendency to accept a superficial treatment of the symptoms, while ignoring the roots? 3. Leap year and leap day is the most highly touted aspect of the Gregorian calendar. Structurally, the Gregorian calendar is indistinguishable from the Julian calendar. The only thing that separates the Gregorian from the Julian calendar is the correction Summary Critique. 20 1"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"of the leap year day. Pope Gregory XIII \"corrected the calendar\" by deleting three leap days from the years that begin the centuries, except those divisible by the number four. Leap day is the extra day that accumulates every four years due to the length of the astronomical year being 365.241299 days and not 365. It can be seen that the fraction .241299 is not quite 1/4, which would be .25. The Julian calendar did nottake this into account, hence an error crept in that caused the spring equinox on the calen- dar to fall some ten days behind the solar moment of the spring equinox-a fact noted by the conquistadors when they encountered the Mayan calendar, which had no such discrepancy. Thus, in 1582, Pope Gregory XIII \"improved\" on Julius Caesar's calen- dar, some 1,627 years later, by adopting the rule that there would be no extra day on centuries-OO years-except on those that are multiples of four. Hence, there was no leap day in the year 1900, but in the year 2000, a multiple of four, there was. What is not well known is that the Vatican does not recognize the leap day in its ceremonial calendar. Why is that? In most countries where Latin-derived languages are spoken, leap day and leap year are referred to as bisiesto, or \"bisextile\" day and \"bisextile\" year. If leap year is every four years, why is it referred to by a word that connotes six, sextile? On the official liturgical Church calendar there is no February 29! Instead, there are two February 24s, and the second February 24 is not counted. If there were to be an extra day that was counted, then the system of fixed feast days would be thrown off. Instead, on leap years, February 24, the Day of the Feast of St. Matthew, is counted twice-or extended to be 48 hours. And since in the Church tradition derived from the Romans the days are counted from the first of the next month, the first always being known as the calends, the date February 24 is technically referred to as the \"sixth of the calends of March\" (February 24 = sixth calends of March, February 25 = fifth calends, February 26 = fourth calends, February 27 = third calends, February 28 = second calends, and March 1 = calends of March). For this reason, the leap year is known as bisiesto because the sixth (siesto) calends of March is doubled, hence \"bi.\" Thus, February 29 is not recognized by the official Church cal- endar of the Vatican, and it is also not counted as a day in its liturgical calendar. Febru- ary 29 only arose out of popular tradition in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The nemesis of accounting for the .241299 extra day per year reveals the fixation of astronomical time in seeking a \"true\" year and detracts from the possibility that the issue of an intercalary, or extra, day can logically and synchronically be handled in many other ways. In the end, it is the mystique surrounding leap day that further con- tributes to the numbing of the sensibility of time accumulated in the instrument known as the Gregorian calendar, \"the little grid of boxes that rules so much of our lives.\"l 202 . Summary Critique"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"4. The word we use to describe the instrument for measuring, the Earth's orbit around the sun, calendar, is derived from the word calends. Calends was the Latin name given by the Romans to the first day of every month. What does it mean? Calends is the name of the account book, the book of payments recording the monthly debts and bills to be paid! No wonder we are ruled by the philosophy \"time is money!\" This philosophy is rooted in the very word we use to describe time reckoning, calendar. A more accurate word for time reckoning might be \"chronometer,\" or even better, \"synchronometer.\" But perhaps the word \"count\" is simpler. We might just say, for example, Thirteen Moon!2 8- Day perpetual count. 5. Dominicalletters code the years of the Gregorian calendar. Scarcely known to anyone but Vatican insiders is the system of dominicalletters that is used to code the years according to the day of the week on which the first Sunday of the year falls. Since the week has seven days, there are seven and only seven dominical letters. These are the letters a-g, where a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, d = 4, e= 5, f = 6, and g = 7. Hence, G-7 (the group of the seven most industrial nations), the name given in 1974 by the CIA to the ruling oligarchy of globalization, is totally rooted in the system of the seven dominicalletters, a-g, to which the Gregorian calendar can be reduced. It works as follows: In 2001, the first day of the year was on a Monday, hence in this year all Mondays are coded by the letter a. Counting forward to the first Sunday, January 7, Sundays this year are coded g. The letter of the year, which is always a capital letter, is based on the lower case letter that codes the first Sunday, therefore, the year 2001 is coded as the capital letter G-it is truly a G-7 year! Not only that, but by this system of \"G-7\" dominicalletters, it can be demonstrated that the order of the Gregorian calendar year repeats within a cyclic structure of precisely twenty-eight years, where the days of the week and the month repeat once again. Hence, the cycle 1973-2001 is a repeat of the cycle 1945-1973, which is a repeat of the cycle 1917-1945, and so forth, where the years 1917, 1945, 1973, and 2001 are calendrically indistinguishable from each other. In any twenty-eight-year cycle, there are always exactly seven leap years! Thus, the key code numbers 28 and 7 of the Law of Time and of the perfect Thirteen Moon!2 8- Day calendar are hidden in and even govern the cyclic order of the Gregorian calendar, whose secrets pretend to lie concealed in the Vatican archives! Expose these secrets and show that the true harmony of time is contained in the 13:20 matrix of the Harmonic Module, which is perfectly coded by 28 and 7. Within this matrix, any set of four tones radially opposite each other, an occult quartet, always adds up to 28. There are 65 (x4) such sets that constitute the Harmonic Module, while seven (multiplied by four), is the prime factor of 28, and is the key Summary Critique. 203"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"unit holding the 13 :20 matrix in place, evident in the position of the seventh vertical column on either side of which is a perfect harmony of six columns each. The seven is also the implicit number in the ratio 13:20 (13 + 7 = 20: 20 - 7 =13). But whereas the 13 :20 matrix is a harmony in which the Law of Time is encoded, the Gregorian calendar is a disharmony, but one that is nonetheless governed by the Law of Time. What the Vatican attempted to destroy at the hands of Bishop de Landa in 1562, in the famous book burning at Izamal Yucatan, is redeemed by the Law of Time. Free of the obscuring, illogical irrationality of the inexact measure of the Gregorian cal- endar, the actual truth of the synchronic order of time may be discovered and re- vealed as the 13:20 mathematical code ofthe Harmonic Module, perfectly coordi- nated with the Thirteen Moon!28-Day count. 6. The Gregorian calendar makes day/date calculations difficult. The twelve uneven months of the Gregorian calendar operate by a subsystem of fifty- two 7 -day weeks, plus one day. Because of the irregularity of the numbering of the months, and because there are 365 and not 364 days in a year, it is almost impossible to make easy calculations month to month and year to year, while insistence on the un- broken succession of the week only compounds this issue. For example, if today on the Gregorian calendar it is Friday, May 4, 2001, what day of the week will June 4 be? What day of the week will July 4 be? There is an immediate mental block-a numbing of the mind. You have to stop and think about it. And in this numbing pause in which your cognitive brain has to be engaged, you lose your telepathic awareness, much as when you look at a clock to find out what time it is. Why should it be this way? Who ben- efits? The answer is, the priests (who know the tedious rules for stating that if it is Friday and it is 2001, then it is dominical e) and the bankers (who gather interest based on the confusion over the erratic disparity of days every month). By contrast, on the perpetual Thirteen Moon calendar, this day would be Spectral Moon Gamma 3-while every third day of every Moon is coded by Gamma. In fact, the third day of every week is coded by the name Gamma. Once the 28-day count is mastered, there is no need to engage the cognitive brain to figure out what day of the week Crystal Moon 3 or Cosmic Moon 3 will be-and in this way the mind is liberated into a telepathic knowing. The system of the seven-day week was introduced into the Julian calendar at the Council of Nicea, A.D. 325, and was adopted from the Jewish calendar, which was derived from the Babylonians, for whom it was an astrological-astronomical con- struct. The fact that the week came from the Babylonians dissolves the argument used by the Vatican to counter the Day Out of Time. According to the Vatican, dis- rupting the succession of the seven-day week would disrupt an order set in motion by 20 4 , . Summary Critique"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"God. The matter of the 7 and the 52 has a much deeper significance when understood in the higher-dimensional light of the Law of Time. A count of fifty-two 7 -day weeks makes perfect sense if you have a count of thirteen 28-day months (7 x 52 = 13 x 28). The observance of the Day Out of Time, the 365th day of the year, produces a perfect and perpetual harmony. Knowing this, to continue to insist on fifty-two weeks while being unwilling to give up a twelve month count that does not have a Day Out of Time is to persist in an adherence to hopeless disharmony. Why do it? 7. What's in a name? Think about it. What does it mean to follow calendars called the Julian and the Gregorian? A calen- dar is an instrument of control. The two most significant calendar reforms in history were the Julian calendar reform of 46-45 B.C., and its successor, the Gregorian, in A.D. 1582. Julius Caesar's motives had everything to do with his personal ambition and the conversion of Rome from a republican to an imperial form of government. Julius Caesar's calendar assured it to be the basis of imperial dominance. The course of the empire utilizing the Julian and later Gregorian calendar has prevailed as the dominant force now inseparable from the course of history itself. The 445-day \"year of confusion\" (46 B.C.), which attended Julius Caesar's reform, was matched by the second significant reform, the Gregorian, in which ten days were \"lost forever,\" between October 5-16, 1582, so that the calendar could \"catch up\" with the sun. While European Catholic countries easily accepted the reform, Protestant coun- tries grudgingly acquiesced. Throughout the Americas, however, the Julian-Gregorian calendar was imposed as an instrument of power and symbol of dominance over the peoples the Europeans had conquered, including the high civilizations of the Maya, Inca, and Aztecs-all of whom happened to use, among other calendars, a Thirteen Moon!28-Day count. As with Julius Caesar, for Pope Gregory XIII the moment was politically ripe for a reform that would communicate itself as a means of expressing and extending power and control, but this time over the entire globe. As European domi- nance and control spread around the planet, even nations with their own established timing systems accepted, for the sake of \"international policy,\" the Gregorian Oulian) calendar system for measuring the solar year. And so Western dominance over every aspect of global life became absolutely assured-until the moment of the Inevitable Event. From its roots in the imperial ego of Julius Caesar to the timely \"reform\" of Pope Gregory XIII, it is not surprising that this calendar, \"despite its odd quirks and the twists of history that produced it,\"2 has become the standard of global civiliza- tion. Given the irregularity of the Julian-Gregorian calendar and the pursuit of the accuracy of astronomical time, history could be nothing more than a compilation of Summary Critique. 205"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"odd quirks and twists, while global civilization itself is the triumph of artificial time over the natural world. Only a species whose time sensibility had been captured by instruments of artificial measure could have become so alienated as to have pro- duced the monstrous conundrum known as the \"fast world,\" a civilization where money and technological advance prevail over human sensibility and the natural order. It is toward the correction of this destructive momentum that all efforts of calendar reform must now be directed. In light of this critique, it is worth reprinting the opening section of the \"United Manifesto by Advocates of Calendar Reform\" that was first published in 1914 at the beginning of the First World War-some ninety years in advance of the Great Cal- endar Change of 2004. It can be seen that the issues of irregularity that prompted reform then are still issues today. However, the effects of not attending to these issues have only become compounded and even more complex, resulting in the chaos of a world at war with terror. Such is the nature of an error gone uncorrected over time-it only becomes more entrenched and turns into the dogmatic and hopelessly conflicted thinking of the everyday mind and its way of life. United Manifesto by Advocates of Calendar Reform WHEREAS we, the undersigned, have for some time been interested in a Reform and Simplification of the Calendar now in use in Western Europe, America, and else- where, with a view to equalizing the four quarters of the year, alleviating the irregu- larities of the months, and establishing a perpetual correspondence between the day of the week and the day of the month, and have supported one or other of several proposals which have been formulated for effecting these reforms; and WHEREAS said proposals usually provide for placing the 365th day of every year and the 366th day of Leap Year without the weekly and monthly enumeration; and WHEREAS we have found that in certain quarters-both ecclesiastical and scientific-Dbjections, possibly often sentimental, but none the less firmly held, have been stated to the employ- ment and adoption of these expedients. . . Therefore we have resolved to unite in urging and advising that the very simple changes under noted should now be made in the Julian and Gregorian Calendars by international agreement. . .3 If you have a crooked standard of measure, and follow it because your parents were also following it, you have become a crooked man. It takes a crooked man to walk a crooked mile and build a crooked house. The issue of calendar reform is both logical and moral. Bad logic leads to bad morality. An error in time dooms the mind. Apocalypses are the reward for bad timekeeping. To remove yourself from the fires of your own self-created apocalypse, change your calendar. In a world of harmony there is no apocalypse. 206 .

This was all to demonstrate that there is much more to a calen- dar change than the mere replacing of one calendar with another, for a calendar itself bears within it an understanding of time that tacitly and unconsciously shapes our very thinking about time. What the calendar change, then, really signifies is the end of one worldview and the birth of another.

A subsequent event, the lifting of the magnificent sarcophagus lid-measuring some four-by-three meters and weighing several tons-to reveal the human remains amidst a splendor of jade, including the jade mask, occurred on November 27, 1952. For some forty years afterwards, scholars debated the meaning of the tomb and the person buried within it. In the 1970s, the Russian scientist Knozerov dubbed the man in the tomb an \"astronaut\" or \"cosmonaut\" because of the similarity of the position of the figure sculpted on the sarcophagus lid to the positions of Russian cosmonauts in their little space capsules. This theory inflamed the imagination of some and was debunked by others, the end result being the enhancement of the awesome mystery of the tomb and the intention of its designer, the man buried in it. The image of the sarcophagus lid is now world famous. Its symbolism has been interpreted to varying degrees by different archaeologists.

Clearly, the mystery of the tomb and its discovery had everything to do with the end of the cycle. At least this had come to be my surmise ever since the 1987 Harmonic Convergence. Like a hawk circling its prey, the meaning of the tomb finally came to my consciousness like a direct hit from the beyond. I was the prey, the hawk, the prophecy itself. Such was the revelation of the Telektonon Prophecy on the morning ofJuly 26, 1993. The coded key was the tiled \"speaking tube,\" by which the tomb was discovered in the first place. Suddenly, this tube spoke its meaning to me: Earth Spirit Speaking Tube, Telektonon by name. After four intense weeks of decoding the glyphs and symbols of the tomb while living in the pool house of an isolated estate in the wind- blown northern part of the main island of Hawaii, I knew that I had to abandon the dreamlike life I led in this Pacific paradise, and with my wife and companion head directly into the unknown, the first stopping point being Mexico, the source of the prophecy. After four months or so of traveling through Mexico, completing the de- coding and announcing the prophecy, including a return to the tomb, we were fi- nally directed to a converted carport in a field near the village of Ocotithin, not far from the birthplace of Quetzalcoatl. It was here where, for a period of nine morn- ings, I awoke dutifully two hours before sunrise to listen to the voice and write down by hand, in a specially prepared notebook, the words exactly as I heard them.

Because the prophecy itself is so inextricably connected with the Law of Time and the message of Time and the Technosphere, I feel it is important to present it as background information to the text of this book. In actuality, the text of the Proph- ecy is an integral part of the Telektonon, Game of Prophecy, where it is read, section by section, on a daily basis, according to the code number of the kin of the day.

NAH CHAN: THE PALACE OF BOLON IK o children of the people of the dawn, a children of the people of the book, I come as the special witness of time to remind you, especially on the day of truth, that in your origin you are one, and on the day of truth you are to make yourselves one again. For this I remind you of the Cube of the Law, Telektonon, and the 28-day, thirteen moon way that is the path of the righteous. Nah Chan, Palenque, Xibalbay, Tollan, Xochicalco, Tepozteco, Amatlan: in these signs dwell my special agents, the witnesses of truth, 13.66.56 and Bolon Ik, Daughter ofJob. For those with eyes, with open mind and sincere heart, this teaching is complete in every stone alignment and marking of the star command base now called Palenque. New Jerusalem is the Palace of Bolon Ik, whose number is 1,728 (144 x 12), Cube of the Law. Seventeen is the power of Heaven, \"solar Uranus,\" which is Earth in Heaven. Twenty-eight is the power of Telektonon, the Spirit Tower of the power of 7 times 4. Never forget, children of the day of truth: All is number. God is a number. God is in all. And everything there in the palace is laid out foursquare from the cord of Heaven, which is the command of the Telektonon. \"Divine word never uttered until the Day of Truth.\" And in that palace, foursquare is the tower of the Cube of the Law. THE CUBE OF THE LAW AND THE TOWER OF BABEL o children of the day of truth, before the separation that divided you into the chil- dren of the dawn and children of the book, there was only the Cube of the Law and the Law of the Cube. Everyone and everything moved and lived within this Law: one mind, one spirit, one will. Within the dimensions and measurements of the cube are all knowledge of Heaven and Earth. And in order to know, expand on, and delight in the sublime Law of the Cube, God created you, 0 children of the day of truth. And though shaped of no more than mud and sounding clay, in you is the perfection of knowing the Cube of the Law, if only you remembered! Children of the Day of Truth, just as the cube is the measure of the perfection of God's thought, so you are the measure of God's unceasing movement, which is called time.

But true to his word, Iblis made wrong fair-seeming. To show himself man's enemy, Iblis split the cube. He drove a forgetting of time within the mind, separating mind from spirit, which is God's movement in all things. 17. And from this forgetting in man, mind and spirit became confused. The will weak- ened. Ego was born. Iblis's many-headed self triumphed. False authority arose. Babylon came to be and in its center the Tower of Babel, the monumental curse for no longer knowing time. 18. In the forgetting was the separation of the people of the dawn from the people of the book. Had there been no Tower of Babel, there would have been no book. The Tower of Babel was a deceit intended to show the Cube of the Law existing outside of the perfection of knowledge already formed within you, a children of the day of truth. 19. Product of the forgetting, the Tower of Babel has a shadow of ever-darkening and all- encompassing dimensions that spreads 5,000 years from Babylonia to all of Earth's most remote wildernesses and mountain retreats. Iblis's curse of Ego and false time are complete but hold only to the day of truth. 20. For God is gracious and most merciful. As long as He could, He kept the people of the dawn away from the Tower of Babel. And to both the people of the dawn and the people of the book, He sent many messengers, apostles of light, witnesses of truth, doers of the righteous way, which is always framed by the invincible Law of the Cube. TELEKTONON: THE FRAME OF TIME 21. As the special witness of time, I, Pacal Votan, know the perfect count of days. I bow in the temple of the tower and the rock, the sanctuary of Bolon Ik. In my body, formed of the ultimate perfection of God's power of all movement and measure (Hunab Ku), is the recollection that is prophecy. Knowing this body as the measure of time, I had built this palace and this tower to correct and to also look for the Tower of Babel, a memory of the remembering. And in my ninefold temple, where, guarded by the nine powers of time, I had this body laid, I left this legacy for you, the Talking Stone of Prophecy. 22. Telektonon, the frame of time I left for you, is a mirror to show you your own truth of time for one last time. For now is the day of truth, the hour of judgment. 23. You, children of the dawn, and you, people of the book, unify yourselves the only way you can: in time, through time, as time. 24. Telektonon, the perfection of time, is the only way for you to escape the fire that consumes the unrighteous. If you who know, who have followed the straight way, the good path, now falter in this challenge of unification in time, Telektonon, which has already been prepared for you, you will perish forever in the fire that now consumes all unbelievers. God's command is in you. Do not listen to the evil one now. . Telektonon Prophecy of Pacal Votan"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"MY COUNT OF DAYS IS PERFECT 25. Listen! My knowledge is this: My count of days is perfect, my knowledge of the Cube of the Law is unsurpassed. Twelve is the number of the temple, but thirteen is the number of God. Twelve times twelve, 144, is the number of the perfection of the temple as light. And twelve times 144, 1728, is the number of the Cube of the Law, Telektonon, the divine word unuttered until now. 26. \"... To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in that stone, a new name written, which no man knoweth, saving he that receiveth it.\" (Revelations 2:17) And that name is Telektonon, and that stone is crystal, and that hidden manna is knowledge of the revelation of time. 27. The number of the elect is 144,000. This was the number set aside by God to be free ofIblis's curse. Dispersed is this number among mankind, and always was it meant to multiply both among the people of the dawn and the people of the book. 28. But since a human kin is the measure of the perfection of time, 144,000 is also the number of days within a cycle of twenty generations. 29. Twelve times 20 generations is 1,728,000 days, the number of the Cube of the Law. But for God, one cycle more, 144,000 days more to entice Iblis to make his score, a total of 1,872,000 days, thirteen cycles of God's elect. 30. I am Pacal Votan, time's special witness, galactic agent of the Nine Great Lords of Destiny, by oath pledged to the honor of Bolon Ik. 31. In my body of time, thirteen star histories rehearse themselves for the day of truth. Each star history possesses its own knowledge keeper appointed by the Nine Great Lords of Galactic Destiny. Thirteen Wisdom Holders, Nine Great Lords, twenty- two in all, to each of whom I am bound by a luminous thread of knowing, sealed by oath to Bolon Ik, White Solar Wind, kin 22 in the Book of Destiny, the Book of Kin. ALL IS NUMBER 32. All is number. God is a number. God is in all. 33. Child of the day of truth, listen: 20 is the number of totality. You have twenty fingers and toes because God has made you the totality of time. Thirteen is the number of God's cosmic wisdom, perfect in its power of unceasing change and circulation. Thir- teen are the joints of your limbs and body. Seven is the difference between 13 and 20. Seven is the mystic perfection between one and thirteen. Seven is the erect spine of the vigilance in which are met the 144,000 mystic fibers of the body's thirst for prophecy. 34. 144,000 kin, 144,000 days, these are called a baktun. Thirteen baktuns, one perfect cycle to rehearse all thirteen star histories. Each baktun, twenty generations, each generation 7,200 kin. So it was that Bolon Ik ordained the sacred count of days, each day a sacred kin, each kin one of the elect, a turning in the twist of universal time, each kin ruled by the power of the nine, the power of the Nine Great Lords of Time.

So began the sacred thirteen baktun count, 3,113 years before the birth of the second of the special messengers, the Apostle Jesus Christ, who sent to you a Book of Dark Proph- ecies, twenty-two sacred chapters in all, through his appointed witness, John ofPatmos. 36. All this I know and declare to be true, for I am time's special witness to the day of truth, Pacal Votan, rehearser of the thirteen star histories, he who adds the 144,000 elect to the cubing of the cube, assuring not twelve baktuns, but thirteen to be the number to bring on the day of truth, God's judgment of your power of remembrance! 37. Children of the people of the dawn, in separating you from the people of the book, God meant you to be the reminder that wisdom is already perfect in your bodily form of time. LORD BUDDHA 38. In remembrance, many messengers did he send you, many fires did he light high atop the mountain for you to see. And one special messenger did he send, one special witness of the dawn. 39. In India, at the midpoint of the seventh baktun, the very center of the mystic cycle, thirteen baktuns in all, Lord Buddha did awaken at the dawn, the morning star, the tree, the Earth, his witnesses of illumination. For seven weeks, he sat beneath that tree. Never moving, he traveled the seven directions and visited with his mind every realm of God's vast creation, only to learn the turning of the Wheel of the Law. 40. Withstanding all efforts of the evil one, he taught unceasingly for nine times five years more, until the age of eighty. All mind teachings did he give; the unwritten Book of Enlightenment did he leave with the Earth. His last turning of the Wheel of the Law was the teaching of the Wheel of Time. Given at the request of King Suchandra of Shambhala who traveled far from Central Asia to receive this teaching, the teach- ing of the Wheel of Time closed the life of Lord Buddha. 41. \"All composite things are impermanent,\" declared Lord Buddha at his death, \"Be a lamp and a refuge unto yourself, look to no outer authority but yourself!\" The fire of Lord Buddha's illumination lit many lamps. The Book of Enlightenment he left with the Earth is a book for all to know in silence with the Earth. 42. In Shambhala did King Suchandra transmit the teaching of the Wheel of Time, Kalachakra, as it is called. Invoking the Nine Great Lords of Galactic Destiny, Shambhala prospered in abundance and wisdom. When came the seventh ruler after King Suchandra, Queen Visvamati, the people of Shambhala ascended as one into the paradise of the fifth dimension, where their wisdom continues to water the rivers that flow beneath the gardens of the righteous. 43. Integrating the power of the five, which is the center, with the power of twelve, which is the root of the cube, the Kalachakra is also the cycle of sixty years (5 x 12).

So it was that after the arrival in Tibet of Buddha's special voice, Padmasambhava, late in the tenth baktun, that the Lords of Shambhala determined to release the teach- ings of the Wheel of Time among the people of the dawn inhabiting Tibet. Thus it was that the Wheel of Prophecy turned the first of these sixteen cycles in A.D. 1027 and completed the sixteenth of these 60-year cycles in A.D. 1987, in partial fulfillment of the Harmonic Convergence of all prophecy. 45. 0 people of the dawn, do not doubt. The appointed day is come. THE HEPTAGONON OF MIND 46. People of the dawn, people of the book, children of the day of truth. To safeguard as long as possible the teachings of the Original Ones from the confusion of the Tower of Babel, God divided the Earth by its one ocean into great island masses called con- tinents. And most far from Babylon was Amerrikua, and also distant was Australia and the Island Kingdoms of Polynesia. Even in Africa, close to Babylon, for many great cycles were the people of the dawn protected in their natural wisdom. 47. But inexorable is my count of days, inexorable the rolling of the Wheel of Time, inexorable the Law of the Cube. 48. Telektonon is the name of the blessing received by those who master the Law of the Cube. Great is the power of God, whose power and blessing are ever close and near, foursquare the manifest action of radiance from the divine intersection of God's pres- ence: divine mind, divine spirit, divine will, divine source from which the Cube is sprung. Foursquare the Cube, the measure of Telektonon, one vast, far-spreading word that is no word at all, but number multiplying itself from within God's unending meditation, which we choose to call creation. 49. From one intersection, six directions plus the seventh, the moving center of time, the navel of Heaven whose cord is a fiber called Kuxan Suum. From the navel of Heaven to the solar plexus runs the Kuxan Suum, highway that reaches to the roots of the stars, passing through each of the heavenly dimensions. 50. I who say this, know, for I am Pacal Votan, who left for you a talking stone, Telektonon. Time's special witness am I, God's spy holding vigil, keeping the sacred count of days, exposing to you the lie of Babylon, the falsification of the Cube into the Tower of Babel! 51. Who now but I can tell you that seven are the directions of the Cube, the Heptaganon of Mind: twelve are the gates, sixteen the powers; moved by the nine great powers of time, these sixteen powers become the number of the elect of the Cube, 144. Multi- plied by the millennium, 144 becomes 144,000, sacred number of days I laid for proph- ecy to know during my first baktun count.

Children of the book, even before the close of my first baktun, twenty generations from the year 3113 B.C., the foundations of the Tower of Babel were laid. Captive now were the 144,000 within the Earthly prison of Babylon's materialism. 53. Yet, by my devotion and power of meditation, from deep within the Earth, aided by Bolon Ik's perseverance on far Uranus, Earth's harmonic twin, I kept the sacred count of days, I watched over the movement of the sacred march of kin. 54. Four more baktuns passed, and Babylon's power was swollen with the loot of Empire. Despite the righteousness of Abraham and the Law of Moses, the shadow of the Tower of Babel only increased in size and darkness. 55. Came the sixth baktun and Imperial Babylon was complete. Its seal of false time and power, taxation, and armed expanse had fulfilled Iblis's desire to degrade and ruin all humanity by making wrong fair-seeming. Fair-seeming now to amass wealth and power; fair-seeming to make a count of time by twelve months; and fair-seeming to regard the thirteenth moon with superstition and contempt! Fair-seeming to gather taxes and to pay them; fair-seeming to make war for the power of King's; fair-seeming that birth and death must be paid for; fair-seeming that all power come from the priests, Iblis's most cherished of men. 56. 0 people of the book, lost to you was all memory of the Law of the Cube, slavery became your lot! But I am Pacal Votan, time's special witness. Even before the com- ing of the second special messenger, Christ the Apostle of Love, by my free will and my knowledge of the power of seven, I laid claim to the Seven Seals of Prophecy that on the day of truth, Iblis's curse would be finished and the righteous would triumph. And now the day of truth is come. Telektonon, the talking stone, now speaks in a voice for all to hear. 57. By the seventh baktun, the Seven Seals of Prophecy were stored in Earth's special lodestone of truth, whose custodian am 1. 58. By the eighth Baktun, Iblis had caused the Tower of Babel to speak more tongues in a growing clash of empires. Into this confusion came the Apostle of Love, crucified for driving the moneylenders from the Temple, misunderstood by the people of the book, finally to be absorbed by the Priests of Babylon, now Roman by tongue, who use this Christ as their emblem to spawn Iblis's greatest evil, the total usurpation of Earthly Time. THE BOOK OF DARK PROPHECIES 59. One special voice did this Jesus have, a man named Saint John ofPatmos, in whom the gift of prophecy was fulfilled.

To those who can read they will find Iblis's numbers 1,260 and 666, well known on the day of truth, for 12:60 is the ratio of the false time that makes martyrs of the righ- teous, and 666 the number of the beast who captures my thirteenth baktun. 61. Children of the day of truth, children of the dawn, people of the book, all this can you hear in the stones of Palen que where in the tenth baktun I took pure human form.

This palace, New Jerusalem, is the mystic power of Telektonon, the twenty-eighth step, the power of seven sancti- fied foursquare. 62. Twenty-two chapters of Revelations are the twenty-two kin complete in Bolon Ik: thir- teen for the power of time, nine for the Nine Lords of Time, whose forms still guard my ark of stone deep within the ninefold temple of the Cube of the Law. Perfect was the time of my coming, kin 1, 366, 560. Perfect was the time of my going, kin 1, 385, 540. 63. Installed in the House of the Serpent, my coming was commemorated by the depar- ture of the third messenger, the special messenger of the day of truth, the Apostle Muhammad, who left for the righteous of the Earth the Book of the Righteous, the Holy Quran, clear signs to understand. 64. As Buddha taught so pure one mind, so Muhammad taught so pure one God. Sub- mission to the will of God is at the center of the Law of the Cube.

I am Pacal Votan, witness of time. Telektonon is my gospel. The talking stone of unifying prophecy is my legacy intended for that special messenger who understands the meaning of my numbers. 66.

Once forty years had elapsed from the time of the discovery of my U ranian crypt, then would come the recovery, the recollection by my special agent of the numbers rehearsed and repeated to announce the day of truth. 67.

THE STORM OF NON-EGO 93. 0 children of the day of truth, children of the people of the book, in the Storm is the sign of God's power. To the Storm is assigned the power of nineteen, the mystic saturation of all number. One hundred fourteen Suras, nineteen times six, the power of the Cube, are the number of Suras in the Holy Quran. Twenty-two years after the finding of my Uranian crypt, Telektonon, came complete revelation of the Quran's power of nineteen, Allah's mercy. Nineteen more years then to unfold the karma of Allah's prophet besieged by Babylonian conspiracy. Then comes the destined year nineteen, kin 144, hour of prophecy's convergence, moment of the day of truth. 94. Let the 124,000 messengers call forth a remnant of 20,000 more; let each of these sound seven trumpets, seven times. Let these seven times seven trumpets call for a following of God's perfect plan.

Pacal Votan am I, enigma to your men of reason. My existence is proof of the workings of higher law. Telepathy is participation in God's knowing, but is no cause to claim full knowledge of His powers. Prophecy too is natural law, the complement to God's mercy. 97. 0-19 is my code. In it are all demonstrations of the wisdom that is always close and near, but that comprehends the web of galactic being and all forms of its natural orders in time. Just as nineteen is the power of God's mercy, so zero is the fullness and emptiness all at once that characterize the nature of mind and all it can know. 98. Lord Buddha called this power of zero Sunyata. The special voice of Buddha, Padmasambhava, whose life span followed mine, exactly as Muhammad's preceded it, knew this Sunyata to be the basis of non-ego. 99.

While the nineteen is related to the Quranic verse 74:30, \"Over it is nineteen,\" and can be interpreted prophetically, the Law of Time confirms the Quran in demonstrating that the number nineteen possesses a supreme and indeed inviolable value. The Law of Time validates all that is true, and contains within it the mathematical confirmation of all systems of thought as different facets of the same synchronic order. The Law of Time is based on the mathematical code of the Harmonic Module, itself a function and a demonstration of the 13 :20 ratio. The vigesimal mathematics of the 13:20 frequency is known as the 0':\"'19 code, which is written with a simple dot- bar notation. As such the 0-19 code is a whole number system in which the count is not 1-9 but 1-19, and the positional zero represents a factor of 20 rather than of 10. As the demonstration of a radial mathematical code, the number 19 plays a singular role in the 13:20 matrix. As the largest compound prime number of the 0-19 count, within the context of this count 19 has certain unique properties and values. It may be asked: why 19? First of all, let us consider the theological dimensions of the number 19 as hinted at by the Quranic verse 74:30. Long an enigma to scholars of the Quran, it was only through the genius of an Egyptian scientist, aided by a computer, that the meaning The Nineteen Code. 229"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"of the verse was finally revealed as the nineteen code-an intricate mathematical system based on the number 19 underlying the entire structure of the Holy Quran. \"For the first time in history we have a scripture with built-in proof of divine authorship-a superhuman mathematical composition.\"l The contribution of Rashad Khalifa (1935-1990) to the role and meaning of the Holy Quran for the entire modem world is without parallel. The martyrdom of this genuine seeker and messenger needs to be redeemed and placed in its proper light. According to Dr. Khalifa, \"Nineteen is the common denominator throughout the Quran's mathematical system.\" \"This is one of the greatest miracles\" (74:35). To summarize in his own words, Dr. Khalifa states: The Quran is characterized by a unique phenomenon never found in any human authored book. Every element of the Quran is mathematically composed-the suras, the verses, the words, the number of certain letters, the number of words from the same root, the number and variety of divine names, the unique spelling of certain words, the absence or deliberate alteration of certain letters within certain words, and many other elements of the Quran besides its content. There are two major facets of the Quran's mathematical system: (1) The mathematical literary composi- tion, and (2) The mathematical structure involving the numbers of suras and verses. Because of this comprehensive mathematical coding, the slightest distortion of the Quran's text or physical arrangement is immediately exposed.2 Like the Law of Time, which could only have been discovered after the opening of Pacal Votan's tomb, in A.D. 1952, the nineteen code of the Quran could only be discovered and unveiled over a twenty-two-year period between 1968 and 1990. Why? Because only with a modem computer could Dr. Khalifa subject every last word and letter of the Quran, in its Arabic original, to the rigorous analysis neces- sary to expose its mathematical perfection. As Dr. Khalifa writes in his footnote to 10:20 (\"They say, 'How come no miracle came down to him from his Lord?' Say, 'The future belongs to God; so wait, and I am waiting along with you.'''): 10.20: In retrospect we see now that the Quran's miracle, indeed \"One of the great- est miracles\" (74:35), was divinely predestined to be unveiled 14 centuries after Muhammad. In view of the current condition of the traditional Muslims, ifMuham- mad had been given this miracle, those Muslims, who are already idolizing Muhammad beside God, would have worshipped him as God incarnate. Additionally, this miracle is obviously designed for the computer age, and to be appreciated by mathematically sophisticated generations.3 The phenomenon of the intricate patterning of the nineteen code as witnessed, for example, in the 19 x 142 (2,698) occurrences of the word God in the Quran, 230 . The Nineteen Code"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"writes Khalifa, \"alone suffices as incontrovertible proof that the Quran is God's mes- sage to the world. No human being(s) could have kept track of 2698 occurrences of the word 'God,' and the number of verses where they occur.\"4 One must bear in mind that the Quran was revealed in a time of primitive simplicity over a twenty- three-year period so that the suras and verses were separated in time and place, while the chronological order of the revelation of the suras is not at all the same as their final format. Moreover, the miracle of the nineteen code is not limited to the appear- ance of the word God, but is vast, intricate, and comprehensive. Dr. Khalifa lists a set of nineteen \"simple facts\" that confirm the Quran's mathematical coding. The \"simple facts\" are those not requiring a calculator or computer to be ascertained. We hereby reproduce these \"simple facts,\" as they are presented in Appendix 1 of Quran: The Pinal Testament (all references to letters and words are to the Arabic original): 1. The first verse (1: 1), known as \"Basmalah,\" consists of 2 . The Quran consists of 114 suras, which is 3. The total number of verses in the Quran is 6346, or (6234 numbered verses and 112 unnumbered verses [Basmalahs]. 6234 +112 = 6346. Note that 6 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 4. The Basmalah occurs 114 times, despite its conspicuous absence from Sura 9 (it occurs twice in Sura 27). 114 = 5. From the missing Basmalah of Sura 9 to the extra Basmalah of Sura 27 there are precisely 6. It follows that the total of the sura numbers from 9 to 27 (9 +10 + 11 + 12 . . . + 26 + 27) is 342, or 7. The total (342) also equals the number of words between the two Basmalahs of Sura 27, and 342 = 8. The famous first revelation (96:1-5) consists of 9. This 19-worded first revelation consists of 76 letters, 10. Sura 96, first in the chronological sequence, consists of 11. This first chronological sura is placed atop the last 12. Sura 96 consists of 304 Arabic letters. 304 = 13. The last revelation (Sura 110) consists of 14. The first verse of the last revelation (11 0: 1) consists of 19 letters. 19 x 6. 19 x 334. 19. 19 x 6. 19 suras. 19 x 18. 19 x 18. 19 words. 19 x 4. 19 verses. 19 suras. 19 x 16. 19 words. 19 letters.

These numbers add up to 14 + 14 + 29 = 57 and 57= 19 x 3. 16. The total of the 29 sura numbers where the Quranic Initials occur is 2 + 3+ 7 + . . . + 50 + 68 = 822, and 822 + 14 (14 sets ofInitials) = 836, or 19 x 44. 17. Between the first initialed sura (Sura 2) and the last initialed sura (Sura 68) there are 38 un-initialed suras. 38= 19 x 2. 18. Between the first and last initialed sura there are of alternating \"initialed\" and \"un-initialed\" suras. 19 sets 19. The Quran mentions 30 different numbers: 1,2,3,4, 5,6, 7, 8,9, 10, 11, 12, 19,20,30,40,50,60, 70, 80, 99,100,200,300,1000,2000,3000,5000,50,000, & 100,000. The sum of these numbers is 162,146= 19 x 6534. Apart from the \"simple facts,\" through use of his computer, a Hewlett Packard HP-IOOO E-series, Dr. Khalifa demonstrated many more complex levels of the cod- ing of the number 19 throughout the Quran. These findings are synthesized in the Appendices to Quran: The Pinal Testament, and are also available in his other texts detailing his research, such as The Miracle of the Quran. The net effect of the truly monumental research effort exerted by Dr. Khalifa was the promotion of a highly reformed Islam based on \"the Quran, the whole Quran, and nothing but the Quran.\" It is for this reason that Dr. Khalifa's translations of the Quran are referred to as \"the Final Scripture,\" (1980) and the revised translation (1992) as the \"Final Testament.\" It was also Dr. Khalifa's insistence on the Quran as the sole basis ofIslam that earned him his martyrdom in Tucson, Arizona, on January 31, 1990. NINETEEN IN THE TWENTY-COUNT POSITIONAL SYSTEM The Law ofTime-T(E) =Art, where T equals the 13:20 timing frequency ratio- upholds the validity of the research of Dr. Khalifa and graphically demonstrates why 19 is the mathematical factor that underlies the Holy Quran. The fact that the Mayan vigesimal system is known as the 0-19 code, and that in this code 19, and not 9, has the supreme value of being the highest number, absolutely enhances the power and significance of Dr. Khalifa's discovery concerning . The Nineteen Code"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"74:30, \"Over it is nineteen.\" The supremacy of the value of 19, imperceptible if we only follow the decimal 1O-count, is fully demonstrated when we examine the 0-19 number code in which the numbers 0-19 are reproduced in a 5 x 4 (= 20) matrix, beginning with 0 and ending with 19. In this number set, which also demonstrates the mathematics of the radial matrix, there are ten pairs of numbers radially ar- ranged, each pair of which adds up to 19: 0+19=19 1+18=19 2+17=19 3 + 16 = 19 4+15=19 5+14=19 6+13=19 7+12=19 8+11=19 9+10=19 In other words, within the parameters of the mathematical matrix in which nine- teen is the integer with the highest value, its value completely informs the radial order of the entire vigesimal system. \"Over it is nineteen.\" This is truly astonishing confirmation of the value accorded to 19 in the Quran. If the Quran is the true word of God, then we must expect that even knowledge unknown to Muhammad or Dr. Khalifa would be contained or coded in the Quran. We are referring, of course, to the Law of Time in its mathematical particulars, beginning with its mathematical base of expression, the 0-19 code. 19 = 7: NINETEEN IN THE 0-19 DOT-BAR NOTATIONAL SYSTEM Just as the number 19 takes on a supreme value in the vigesimal system inconceiv- able in the decimal system, so the vigesimal order commands its own notational system. The 0-19 dot-bar notational system substantiates the meaning and power of 19 as the prime mathematical, saturated value unit in the twenty count. The dot-bar notational order is a holographic system distinct from the alphabetic system of Ara- bic numerals by which we write 1-10. The distinction between use of the two notational orders is profound. This nota- tional order uses only three notational symbols to build up the holographic context of The Nineteen Code. 233"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"the fourth-dimensional number. One dot represents one unit; one bar represents a five-unit order; and a positional zero completes the system. The vigesimal nota- tional system reveals the entire radial sequence of the 0-19 code to be a highly stream- lined and aesthetic pattern. Brief contemplation shows that there are two patterned orders consisting of four vertical sets of five units each, and five horizontal sets of four units each. It is seen that nineteen represents the maximum saturation of both the vertical and horizontal orders, and consists of the maximum number of dots (four) and the maximum number of bars (three). It is also visibly manifest that 19 = 7 notational units, the maximum number of units. The fact that 19 is represented by seven notational units confirms Sura 1, which has seven verses and the first line of which consists of nineteen Arabic letters. How- ever, from the point of view of the Law of Time, 7 is the key implicit mathematical unit in the absolute timing frequency ratio, 13:20-the difference between 20 and 13 is 7, and the midpoint between 1 and 13 is also 7. While Dr. Khalifa is responsible for determining the dominance of nineteen as the mathematical key underlying the patterning and meaning of the Quran, the Law of Time provides an even more profound lens through which to consider Dr. Khalifa's work, by placing nineteen in a superior (vigesimal) mathematical and theological context. 23 4 . .

Like the 0-19 radial matrix, the 13:20 ratio is also organized as a radial matrix of 260 (13 x 20) kin or units. As a cycle of 260 days, the 13 x 20 timing matrix is the fourth-dimensional The Nineteen Code. 235"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"gauge that synchronically unifies the Thirteen Moon calendar. Known by the traditional and ancient Maya as the Tzolkin or \"sacred count,\" the 13 x 20 gauge or Harmonic Module is the key to the mathematics of the fourth dimension, or the \"Hereafter.\" Just as the mathematics of the third dimension is decimal-based, so the mathematics of the fourth dimension is vigesimal-based. Hence, the power of 20 as a self-existing proportion (4 x 5 = 5 x 4). For any frequency to occur two proportions must be coincident. Thirteen, which is a function of the 7 factor, is the proportion that complements the 0-19 vigesimal proportion of 20. Hence the Tzolkin consists of twenty horizontal orders and thir- teen vertical orders = 260 kin, which are also arranged in twenty sets of thirteen-kin wavespells, all numbered 1-13 in dot-bar notation. All of the kin in the 260-unit matrix are also individually numbered: kin 1, kin 2 . . . kin 259, kin 260. Within the 13:20 order of260 kin, 13 sets of20 or 20 sets of 13, only two of the numbers in the vigesimal code 0-19 occur thirteen times: the number 19 and the number 20 (= positional zero). While 20 occurs precisely thirteen times, 19 occurs thirteen times with a remainder of thirteen (13 x 19 = 247 = 260 - 13). The position and notational order of the thirteen occurrences of the number 19 in the 260-unit Tzolkin create a perfect strand of thirteen units. This 19 x 13 (19 = 260) strand demonstrates the supreme invariability and inviolability of the number 19 in the vigesimal code of fourth-dimensional time. The purity of the movement of the 13 x 19 strand of the Tzolkin is further augmented by the vigesimal or 20-count manner of writing numbers. Even as trans- literated into the Arabic system of writing numbers, it will be seen that in the vigesimal code every multiple of 19 always adds up to 19, a similar power held by all multiples of 9 in the decimal code. In vigesimal notation, the second order units are always multiples of 20 and not 10. Hence 38 = 1.18, where 1 = 20 + 18; or 5.14 = 114, where 5 = 100 + 14. Finally, while the sequence 1-13 defines the thirteen galactic tones of fourth- dimensional time, the 0-19 matrix is represented by twenty icons and a four-color (4 x 5 = 20) permutation sequence. The combination of color, icon, and tone gives each of the 260 kin a \"galactic signature.\" This completes the description of the Harmonic Modulerrzolkin. We now present the thirteen multiples of 19 as defined by the 13 x 19 strand running from lower left to upper right in a perfect cross-stitch sequence that reverses the horizontal order of the 0-19 code frequencies.

Following the method of Dr. Khalifa, probability analysis of mathematical con- stituents based on the assumption that certain numbers will be self-verifying, we start our program with the six suras that are multiples of nineteen: As can be seen, the sum of the six numbers of the suras that are multiples of 19 is exactly 399, or 19 x 21, the maximum factor in the vigesimal 20 x 20 matrix. Ex- pressed in the vigesimal code this number, 399 = 19.19 [19 ( x 20 = 380) +19], the only multiple of 19 in the vigesimal code that is written with two 19s, whose sum is precisely twice nineteen, 38, and is written with fourteen notational symbols rather than seven. This unique number, 19.19 (399), verifies \"nineteen is over all,\" by plac- ing 19 over 19 itself. The unique qualities of this most unique of multiples of 19 also indicates why the Quran consists of exactly six times nineteen suras. Six is the differ- ence between the Quranic 19 and 13, the prime number of the Law of Time. More amazing than the sum of the six suras that are multiples of 19 being 19.19 is the fact that the sum of the verses of these same six suras is 260. This is incontro- vertible evidence for the formulation 19 = 260, and substantiates the mathematical patterning of the Quran to include the principle factor of the Law of Time, 260 (= 13 x 20). We are certain that Dr. Khalifa added the verses of these same suras and may have been perplexed at the meaning of the resultant number, 260. Of course, Dr. Khalifa did not know that 260 is the sum factor of the two proportions that create the natural timing frequency, 13:20. It is also interesting that discovery of the 13 :20 timing frequency, December 10, 1989, was made at almost the precise moment as Dr. Khalifa had completed the introduction to The Pinal Testament, the summation of his research on the Quranic nineteen code, Ramadan 26, 1409 (December, 1989). This points to the mysterious 238 . The Nineteen Code"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"movement of the Divine Will in establishing the mathematical proof of the Quran. Just as the work of Dr. Khalifa was terminated within a month of his completing the Final Testament, so the Law of Time, which would substantiate and vindicate the Quranic nineteen code, was ordained and propelled into its process of manifestation at exactly the same moment. Now with the Law of Time the investigation begun by Dr. Khalifa is complete. Just as there are six suras that are multiples of 19 within the Holy Quran, so the key factor of the Law of Time, the number 260, is coded into the sum of the verses of these six suras. The door is opened for entirely new comprehension of the meaning and purpose of the Holy Quran. The Law of Time and the Holy Quran in mutual resonance will establish the proof of the advent and triumph of the Religion of Truth.

Roys (Norman, Okla.: University of Oklahoma Press, 1967); The Codex Perez and the Book of Chi lam Balam ofMani, edited and translated by Eugene Craine and Reginald Reindorp (Norman, Okla.: University of Oklahoma Press, 1979); and El Libro de los Libros de Chilam Balam, edited and translated by Alfredo Barrera Vasquez and Silvia Rendon (Mexico City: Fondo de Cultura Economica, 1948, 1986). The issue of being a \"prophetic messenger\" is a touchy one for many people. However, as it is written in the Quran, \"In truth we are always sending messengers. . .\" (44:5). Messengers, as often as not, are self-revealed and confirmed only by God. In my case, I have been able to trace back the prophetic lineage of the Chilam Balam to Pacal Votan, from whom I have received direct transmission. The method of transmission is similar to that of the terma tradition of Tibet. Terma, or \"hidden treasure,\" is left by a sage or prophet to be \"discovered\" at a precise moment much later in time by one designated to do so. See Tulku Thondup Rinpoche, Hidden Teachings of Tibet: An Explanation of the Terma Tradition of Tibetan Buddhism (Boston: Wisdom Publications, 1997). 3. This phrase is used often by Dr. Rashad Khalifa (1935-1990), whose groundbreaking translation and research of the Quran through the aid of the computer led to the discov- ery of the intricate nineteen-based mathematical code that underlies this unique text. His work is summarized in his translation of the Quran with its numerous appendices, Quran: The Final Testament (Fremont: Universal Unity, 1992). My own studies on this topic have resulted in two works: Pacal TfJtIln and Judgement Day (portland, Oreg.: Planet Art Network, 1999), and 19 = 260: The Holy Quran and the Law of Time, unpublished, 1999.
