Published in 1975, it was followed by The DivineRomance and Journey to Self-realization. Included in these anthologies arelectures, informal classes, and inspirational writings, originally published bySelf-Realization Fellowship in the magazine founded by Sri Yogananda in 1925(known since 1948 as Self-Realization). Most of the talks were given at theSelf-Realization Fellowship temples he established and at the internationalheadquarters of his society in Los Angeles. He spoke extemporaneously, using nonotes or written text, regardless of his topic. That his words have beenpreserved for present and future generations is due primarily to the devotedefforts of one of his earliest and closest disciples, who served for many yearsas his confidential secretary and assisted him in carrying out his spiritual andhumanitarian work. For more than two decades Sri Daya Mata (president ofSelf-Realization Fellowship from 1955 until her passing in 2010) recordedstenographically his public lectures and classes, the guidance he gaveinformally when meeting with small groups of disciples, and much of his personalcounsel.

The year was 1931. As I stood at the backof the crowded auditorium, I became transfixed, unaware of anything around meexcept the speaker and his words. My whole being was absorbed in the wisdom anddivine love that were pouring into my soul and flooding my heart and mind. Icould only think, “This man loves God as I have always longed to love Him. Heknows God. Him I shall follow.” And from that moment, I did.As I felt the transfiguring power of his words on my own life during those earlydays with Paramahansaji, there arose within me a feeling of the urgent need topreserve his words for all the world, for all time. It became my sacred andjoyous privilege, during the many years I was with Paramahansa Yogananda, torecord his lectures and classes, and also many informal talks and words ofpersonal counsel—truly a vast treasure house of wondrous wisdom and God-love. AsGurudeva spoke, the rush of his inspiration was often reflected in the swiftnessof his speech; he might speak without pause for minutes at a time, and continuefor an hour. While his hearers sat enthralled, my pen was flying! As I took downhis words in shorthand, it was as though a special grace had descended,instantly translating the Guru’s voice into the shorthand characters on thepage. Their transcription has been a blessed task that continues to this day.Even after such a long time—some of my notes are more than forty years old—whenI start to transcribe them, they are miraculously fresh in my mind, as thoughthey had been recorded yesterday. I can even hear inwardly the inflections ofGurudeva’s voice in each particular phrase.The Master seldom made even the slightest preparation for his lectures; if heprepared anything at all, it might consist of a factual note or two, hastilyjotted down. Very often, while riding in the car on the way to the temple, hewould casually ask one of us: “What is my subject today?” He would put his mindon it, and then give the lecture extemporaneously from an inner reservoir ofdivine inspiration.The subjects for Gurudeva’s sermons at the temples were set and announced inadvance. But sometimes his mind was working in an entirely different vein whenhe began to speak. Regardless of the “subject for today,” the Master would voicethe truths engrossing his consciousness at that moment, pouring forth pricelesswisdom in a steady stream from the abundance of his own spiritual experience andintuitive perception. Nearly always, at the close of such a service, a number ofpeople would come forward to thank him for having enlightened them on a problemthat had been troubling them, or perhaps for having explained some philosophicalconcept in which they were particularly interested.Sometimes, while he was lecturing, the Guru’s consciousness would be so upliftedthat he would momentarily forget the audience and converse directly with God;his whole being would be overflowing with divine joy and intoxicating love. Inthese high states of consciousness, his mind completely at one with the DivineConsciousness, he inwardly perceived Truth, and described what he saw. Onoccasion, God appeared to him as the Divine Mother, or in some other aspect; orone of our great Gurus, or other saints, would manifest in vision before him. Atsuch times, even the audience would feel deeply the special blessing bestowed onall present. During such a visitation of Saint Francis of Assisi, whom Gurudevadeeply loved, the Master was inspired to compose the beautiful poem, “God! God!God!”The Bhagavad Gita describes an enlightened master in these words: “The Selfshines forth like a sun in those who have banished ignorance by wisdom” (V:16).One might have been overawed by Paramahansa Yogananda’s spiritual radiance, wereit not for his warmth and naturalness, and a quiet humility, which put everyoneinstantly at ease. Each person in the audience felt that Gurudeva’s talk wasaddressed to him personally. Not the least of the Master’s endearing qualitieswas his understanding sense of humor. By some choice phrase, gesture, or facialexpression he would bring forth an appreciative response of hearty laughter atjust the right moment to drive home a point, or to relax his listeners afterlong and intense concentration on a particularly deep subject.One cannot convey in the pages of a book the uniqueness and universality ofParamahansa Yogananda’s vivid, loving personality. But it is my humble hope, ingiving this brief background, to afford a personal glimpse that will enrich thereader’s enjoyment and appreciation of the talks presented in this volume.To have seen my Gurudeva in divine communion; to have heard the profound truthsand devotional outpourings of his soul; to have recorded them for the ages; andnow to share them with all—what joy is mine! May the Master’s sublime words openwider the doors to unshakable faith in God, to deeper love for that One who isour beloved Father, Mother, and Eternal Friend.Daya MataLos Angeles, CaliforniaMay 1975"},{"pageContent":"IntroductionMankind is engaged in an eternal quest for that “something else” he hopes willbring him happiness, complete and unending. For those individual souls who havesought and found God, the search is over: He is that Something Else.—Paramahansa YoganandaThis volume of talks by Paramahansa Yogananda is for all who have ever knowndisappointment, dissatisfaction, discouragement, sorrow, or an unfulfilledspiritual longing. It is for those who have sought to understand the enigmas oflife; for those who have held within their hearts an uncertain hope about thereality of God and the possibility that He could be known; and for seekers whohave already turned toward God in their quest. May it be, for each reader, a rayof divine light on the path, bringing new life and inspiration and a sense ofdirection. God is all things to all people.Man’s Eternal Quest is a book about God: about God’s place in man’s life; in hishopes, will, aspirations, accomplishments. Life, man, achievement—all are butmanifestations of the one omnipresent Creator, as inseparably dependent on Himas the wave is dependent on the ocean. Paramahansaji explains why and how manwas created by God, and how he is immutably a part of God, and what this meansto each one personally. Realization of the oneness of man and his Creator is thewhole essence of Yoga. An understanding of man’s inescapable need for God, inevery aspect of living, removes the otherworldliness from religion and makesknowing God the basis of a scientific and practical approach to life.As a man of God, and as an authority on the ancient divine science of Yoga,Paramahansa Yogananda has received the highest credentials from his spiritualcontemporaries, and from readers of his works in all parts of the world—theliterary and general public as well as his followers. That he has also receivedthe ultimate commendation from the Supreme Authority is amply attested to by themanifest blessings of God on his exemplary life, and by the infinitelybeautiful, uniquely edifying responses he received from God in vision and divinecommunion. This comment in Review of Religions, published by Columbia UniversityPress, is typical of the acclaim received by Paramahansa Yogananda’s earlierwork, Autobiography of a Yogi: “There has been nothing before, written inEnglish or in any other European language, like this presentation of Yoga.” TheSan Francisco Chronicle wrote: “Yogananda presents a convincing case for Yoga,and those who ‘came to scoff’ may remain to pray.” From Schleswig-HolsteinischeTagespost, Germany: “We must credit this book with the power to bring about aspiritual revolution.” Of Paramahansa Yogananda himself, Swami Sivananda,founder of the Divine Life Society, Rishikesh, India, said: “A rare gem ofinestimable value, the like of whom the world is yet to witness, ParamahansaYogananda has been an ideal representative of the ancient sages and seers, theglory of India.” His Holiness the Shankaracharya of Kanchipuram (1894–1994),revered spiritual leader of millions in South India, wrote of Paramahansaji: “Asa bright light shining in the midst of darkness, so was Yogananda’s presence inthis world. Such a great soul comes on earth only rarely, when there is a realneed among men. We are grateful to Yogananda for spreading Hindu philosophy insuch a wonderful way in America and the West.”Paramahansa Yogananda was born in India on January 5, 1893. He had a remarkablechildhood that clearly indicated his life was marked for a divine destiny. Hismother recognized this and encouraged his noble ideals and spiritualaspirations. When he was only eleven, the loss of his mother, whom he lovedabove all else in this world, made firm his inherent resolve to find God and toreceive from the Creator Himself the answers yearned for in every human heart.He became a disciple of the great Jnanavatar (incarnation of wisdom) Swami SriYukteswar Giri. Sri Yukteswar was one of a line of exalted gurus, with whomYoganandaji had been linked from birth: Sri Yogananda’s parents were disciplesof Lahiri Mahasaya, guru of Sri Yukteswar. When Yogananda was an infant in hismother’s arms, Lahiri Mahasaya had blessed him and foretold: “Little mother, thyson will be a yogi. As a spiritual engine, he will carry many souls to God’skingdom.” Lahiri Mahasaya was a disciple of Mahavatar Babaji, the deathlessmaster who revived in this age the ancient science of Kriya Yoga. Praised byKrishna in the Bhagavad Gita, and by Patanjali in the Yoga Sutras, Kriya Yoga isboth a transcendent technique of meditation and an art of living that leads tounion of the soul with God. Mahavatar Babaji revealed the sacred Kriya to LahiriMahasaya, who handed it down to Sri Yukteswar, who taught it to ParamahansaYogananda.When in 1920 Paramahansa Yogananda was deemed ready to begin his world missionof disseminating the soul-liberating science of Yoga, Mahavatar Babaji told himof the divine responsibility that was to be his: “You are the one I have chosento spread the message of Kriya Yoga in the West. Long ago I met your guruYukteswar at a Kumbha Mela; I told him then I would send you to him fortraining. Kriya Yoga, the scientific technique of God-realization, willultimately spread in all lands, and aid in harmonizing the nations through man’spersonal, transcendental perception of the Infinite Father.”Paramahansa Yogananda began his mission in America as a delegate to theInternational Congress of Religious Liberals in Boston in 1920. For more than adecade he traveled the length and breadth of America, speaking almost daily tocapacity audiences in all the major cities. On January 28, 1925, the Los AngelesTimes reported: “The Philharmonic Auditorium presents the extraordinaryspectacle of thousands...being turned away an hour before the advertised openingof a lecture with the 3000-seat hall filled to its utmost capacity. SwamiYogananda is the attraction. A Hindu invading the United States to bring God...,preaching the essence of Christian doctrine.” It came as no small revelation tothe West that Yoga—so eloquently expounded and clearly interpreted by SriYogananda—is a universal science, and that as such it is indeed the “essence” ofall true religions.In Los Angeles in 1925, Paramahansa Yogananda founded the internationalheadquarters for Self-Realization Fellowship, the society he had started inIndia in 1917 as Yogoda Satsanga Society of India.In the late 1930s Paramahansaji began to withdraw gradually from nationwidepublic lecturing. “I am not interested in crowds,” he said, “but in souls whoare in earnest to know God.” Thereafter, he concentrated his efforts on classesfor serious students, and spoke mostly at his own Self-Realization Fellowshiptemples and the international headquarters. The selections in this volume aretalks given primarily during this period.Paramahansa Yogananda had often voiced this prediction: “I will not die in bed,but with my boots on, speaking of God and India.” On March 7, 1952, the prophecywas fulfilled. At a banquet in honor of the Ambassador of India, B. R. Sen,Paramahansaji was a guest speaker. He delivered a soul-stirring address,concluding with these words from a poem he had written, “My India”: “WhereGanges, woods, Himalayan caves and men dream God—I am hallowed; my body touchedthat sod!” He then lifted his eyes upward and entered mahasamadhi, an advancedyogi’s conscious earth-exit. He died as he had lived, exhorting man to knowGod.1 [part0008.html#footnote-000]The Guru’s talks in the earliest years of his ministry were recorded onlyspasmodically. But when Sri Daya Mata became a disciple of Paramahansa Yoganandain 1931, she undertook the sacred task, faithfully recording, for thegenerations to come, all of her Guru’s talks and classes. This volume is but asampling: under the direction of Paramahansa Yogananda, manytranscriptions—particularly those containing private instruction and meditationtechniques and principles given to Self-Realization class students—were compiledalong with some of his writings into a series of Self-Realization FellowshipLessons; other talks appear as a regular feature in Self-Realization magazine. Asecond anthology, The Divine Romance, and a third, Journey to Self-realization,are companion volumes to Man’s Eternal Quest.As most of the talks set forth in this book were presented before audiencesfamiliar with Self-Realization teachings, some clarification of terminology andphilosophical concepts may be helpful to the general reader. To this end, manyfootnotes have been included; also a glossary explaining certain Sanskrit words,and other philosophical terms, and giving information about events, persons, andplaces associated with the life and work of Paramahansa Yogananda. It may benoted here that unless otherwise indicated the quotations from the Bhagavad Gitain this volume are from Paramahansa Yogananda’s own translations, which herendered from the Sanskrit sometimes literally and sometimes in paraphrase,depending on the context of his talk. For most Gita quotations in thisreprinting of Man’s Eternal Quest, we have used the definitive version given byParamahansaji for his comprehensive translation and commentary: God Talks WithArjuna: The Bhagavad Gita—Royal Science of God-Realization (published bySelf-Realization Fellowship in 1995). In talks where he was rendering a Gitapassage more freely in order to emphasize a specific point, the paraphrase hasbeen retained and noted as such in the footnote citation.Paramahansa Yogananda could have said, with Jesus, “Think not that I am come todestroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill”(Matthew 5:17). Paramahansaji honored all religions and their founders, and heldin respect all sincere seekers of God. Part of his world mission is “to revealthe complete harmony and basic oneness of original Christianity as taught byJesus Christ and original Yoga as taught by Bhagavan Krishna.” (See Aims andIdeals [part0073.html#_idTextAnchor084].) Far from introducing a divisive dogmato the world, Paramahansaji showed that the practice of yoga establishes aninner attunement with God that constitutes the universal basis of all religions.Abstractions of theoretical religion pale before actual experience of God. Truthcannot be wholly proved to any seeker by anyone else; but by the practice ofyoga, the aspirant can prove truth for himself through his own experience.God is; and each man who will seek Him sincerely will know Him. Man can have nolife or power to act, think, or feel without borrowing that power from God.Therefore, Paramahansaji pointed out, knowing God is not only a privilege and adivine duty, but a practical necessity. Why should man grovel inself-insufficiency when he can tap the Source of all power and fulfillment?The wisdom in this volume is not the studied learning of a scholar; it is theempirical testimony of a dynamic spiritual personage whose life was filled withinner joy and outer accomplishment, a world teacher who lived what he taught, aPremavatar whose sole desire was to share God’s wisdom and love with all.Self-Realization FellowshipLos Angeles, California[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0008.html#footnote-000-backlink] An award-winning documentary film aboutParamahansa Yogananda's life and work, Awake: The Life of Yogananda, wasreleased in October 2014."},{"pageContent":"MAN’S ETERNAL QUEST"},{"pageContent":"How Seekers First Found GodSelf-Realization Fellowship International Headquarters, Los Angeles, California,November 11, 1934We can readily understand how man first conceived of a science of medicine. Hesuffered physically and therefore sought a method to heal himself. But how didman happen to try to find out about God? The question gives scope for profoundreflection.In the Vedas1 [part0010_split_000.html#footnote-012] of India we find theearliest true concept of God. In her scriptures India has given the worldimmortal truths that have stood the test of time.Every material inventor is actuated by material need—“necessity is the mother ofinvention.” Similarly motivated by necessity, the early rishis2[part0010_split_000.html#footnote-011] of India became ardent spiritual seekers.They had found that without inner satisfaction, no amount of external goodfortune can bring lasting happiness. How then can one make himself really happy?That is the problem the wise men of India undertook to solve.Three Aspects of NatureWorship of God in prehistoric times began through man’s fear of the variousforces of nature. When it rained excessively, floods killed many people. Awed,man thought of the rain and wind and other natural forces as gods.Later on, human beings realized that nature operates in three ways: creative,preservative, and dissolutive. A wave rising out of the ocean exemplifies thecreative state; staying for a moment on the sea-breast, it is in thepreservative state; and sinking back into the deep, it passes through thedissolutive state.Just as Jesus beheld the universal force of evil personified in Satan, so thegreat rishis beheld the universal forces of creation, preservation, anddissolution personified in definite forms. The sages of old named them Brahmathe Creator, Vishnu the Preserver, and Shiva the Destroyer. These primal powerswere created as projections of the unmanifested Spirit to unfold His infinitedrama of creation, while He, as God beyond creation, remains ever hidden behindtheir consciousness. In times of cosmic dissolution, all creation and its vastactivating forces dissolve back into Spirit. There they rest until called uponagain by the Great Director to reenact their roles.3[part0010_split_000.html#footnote-010]A Story About Brahma, Vishnu, and ShivaIn India there is a popular story about Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. They wereboasting among themselves about their tremendous might. Suddenly a little boycame up and said to Brahma, “What do you create?” “Everything,” Brahma repliedgrandly. The boy asked the other two gods what their work was. “We preserve anddestroy everything,” they answered.The young visitor was holding in his hand a single piece of straw about the sizeof a toothpick. Placing it in front of Brahma, he asked, “Can you create a pieceof straw like this?” After prodigious effort, Brahma found to his astonishmentthat he could not. The lad then turned to Vishnu and asked him to save thestraw, which was slowly starting to dissolve under the boy’s steady gaze.Vishnu’s efforts to hold it together were fruitless. Finally, the littlestranger produced the piece of straw again and asked Shiva to destroy it. Buttry as Shiva would to annihilate it, the tiny straw remained intact.The little boy turned again to Brahma: “Did you create me?” he asked. Brahmathought and thought; he could not remember ever having created this amazingchild. Suddenly the boy vanished. The three gods awoke from their delusion andremembered that behind their power is a Greater Power.God, the Supreme CauseIn the Western world the idea of God developed through observation of the law ofcause and effect. Man can materialize objects by taking materials from the earthand shaping them in accordance with a preconceived idea; therefore it seemedreasonable to conclude that this whole universe must have been created out ofideas. This led to the concept that everything must have existed first as anidea. Someone had to create that first idea or cosmic plan. Thus through theanalogy of the law of cause and effect, intelligent men reasoned that there mustbe a Supreme Cause.Science has learned that all matter is made of invisible buildingblocks—electrons and protons—just as a house is built of bricks. But nobody cantell why some electrons and protons become wood, and others become human bone,and so on. What Intelligence guides them? This line of questioning gives roomfor God in even the material scientist’s theories about the nature of thephenomenal worlds. The sages of India say that everything proceeds from and goesback into its source: God.Evidence of Order and Harmony Is EverywherePerceiving that every human being is a compound of matter and mind, the earliestWestern thinkers believed that two independent forces existed: nature and mind.Later they began asking themselves, “Why is everything in nature arranged in aparticular way? Why isn’t one of man’s arms longer than the other? Why don’tstars and planets collide? Everywhere we see evidence of order and harmony inthe universe.” They concluded that mind and matter could not be both separateand sovereign; a single Intelligence must govern all. This conclusion naturallyled to the idea that there is just one God, who is both the Cause and matter andthe Intelligence within and behind it. One who attains the ultimate wisdomrealizes that everything is Spirit—in essence, though hidden in manifestation.If you had the perception, you would see God in everything. Then the questionis, how did seekers first find Him?As the beginning step, they closed their eyes to shut out immediate contact withthe world and matter, so they could concentrate more fully on discovering theIntelligence behind it. They reasoned that they could not behold God’s presencein nature through the ordinary perceptions of the five senses. So they began totry to feel Him within themselves by deeper and deeper concentration. Theyeventually discovered how to shut off all five senses, thus temporarily doingaway entirely with the consciousness of matter. The inner world of the Spiritbegan to open up.4 [part0010_split_000.html#footnote-009] To those great ones ofancient India who undeviatingly persisted in these inner investigations, Godfinally revealed Himself.Devotion and Right Activity Attract God’s AttentionThus the saints gradually began to convert their conceptions of God intoperceptions of Him. That is what you must do also, if you would know Him. Youdon’t stay long enough at your prayers. First you must have a right concept ofGod—a definite idea through which you can form a relationship with Him—and thenyou must meditate5 [part0010_split_000.html#footnote-008] and pray until thatmental conception becomes changed into actual perception. Then you will knowHim. If you persist, the Lord will come. The Searcher of Hearts wants only yoursincere love. He is like a little child: someone may offer Him his whole wealthand He doesn’t want it; and another cries to Him, “O Lord, I love you!” and intothat devotee’s heart He comes running.Don’t seek God with any ulterior motive, but pray to Him withdevotion—unconditional, one-pointed, steady devotion. When your love for Him isas great as your attachment to your mortal body, He will come to you.In seeking the Lord, activity comes after devotion in importance. Some say, “Godis Power; therefore let us act with power.” When you are active in doing good,with the Lord ever uppermost in your mind, you will perceive Him in this way.But there is wrong as well as right activity even in doing good. A zealouschurchman who brings more and more people into his congregation solely tosatisfy his own ego is not going to please God through that activity. To realizethe presence of the Divine Indweller should be the first desire in every heart.It is when you persistently, selflessly perform every action with love-inspiredthoughts of God that He will come to you. Then you realize that you are theOcean of Life, which has become the tiny wave of each life. That is the way ofknowing the Lord through activity. When in every action you think of Him beforeyou act, while you are performing the action, and after you have finished it, Hewill reveal Himself to you. You must work, but let God work through you; this isthe best part of devotion. If you are constantly thinking that He is walkingthrough your feet, working through your hands, accomplishing through your will,you will know Him. You should also develop discrimination, so that you preferspiritually constructive, God-conscious activity to work performed without anythought of Him.Meditation Is the Highest Form of ActivityBut greater than activity, devotion, or reason, is meditation. To meditate trulyis to concentrate solely on Spirit. This is esoteric meditation. It is thehighest form of activity that man can perform, and it is the most balanced wayto find God. If you work all the time you may become mechanical and lose Him inpreoccupation with your duties; and if you seek Him only through discriminativethought you may lose Him in the labyrinths of endless reasoning; and if youcultivate only devotion for God, your development may become merely emotional.But meditation combines and balances all these approaches.Work, eat, walk, laugh, cry, meditate—only for Him. That is the best way tolive. In so doing you will be truly happy serving Him, loving Him, and communingwith Him. So long as you let the desires and weaknesses of the physical bodycontrol your thoughts and actions, you will not find Him. Always be master ofyour body. When you sit in the church or temple, you perhaps feel a littledevotion and a little discriminative perception, but that is not enough. Theesoteric activity of meditation is necessary if you really want to be aware ofHis presence.You might think that after two hours of meditation I would be bored to death.No, I couldn’t find anything in the world as intoxicating as this God of mine.When I drink that aged wine of my soul, a skyful of happiness throbs in myheart. Divine joy is in everyone. Sunlight shines equally on the charcoal andthe diamond, but the diamond reflects the light. Such are the transparent mindsthat know and reflect Spirit.Thus in the esoteric activity of meditation you have the solution to the mysteryof knowing God. I do not blame you for what you do, but for what you do not do.You think you have no time for God. Suppose the Lord were too busy to look afteryou? What then? Wrest your mind from the mirage of the senses and habit. Why bedeluded like that? I am pointing out to you a land more beautiful than anythinghere can ever be. I am telling you of a happiness that will intoxicate you nightand day—you won’t need sense temptations to enthrall you. Discipline your bodyand your mind. Control your senses. Find God!I often say that this body is a switchboard and the five senses are itstelephone instruments. Through them I am in touch with the world; but when Idon’t wish to communicate, I shut off my five senses and live in theinexpressible joy of God. The Heavenly Father doesn’t want you, His children, tosuffer anymore. The sensory delusion in which you live must be overcome. Youshould conceive of God as the highest necessity of life. Break the shackles oflimitation, of dark habits and mechanical daily routine. I condemn no man—onlyman’s unbelief and oblivion of God. He can be known by using the technique ofmeditation. Then He shall throb as wisdom in your mind, and as joy in yourheart, and you will be more active and more successful than you have ever beenbefore.Dear ones, I was once like you. I walked the earth seeking truth and happiness,yet everything that promised me joy gave me misery, and so I turned to God. Youall must discover your own divinity and win the kingdom of God for yourselves.The Self Is Your SaviorThese deep truths are not for the inspiration of a passing moment but should beassimilated and made practical for your highest benefit. If only people knewwherein lies their own good! To those who act wrongly the Self is an enemy.Befriend the Self and the Self will save you. There is no other savior than yourSelf.6 [part0010_split_000.html#footnote-007] The fetters of ignorance and badhabits keep you bound. It is because you are determined to follow your wronghabits that you suffer. If only you would picture life a little ahead; lest thetime, the precious time that is given you, slip away fruitlessly. The Hindushave a saying: “The child is busy with play, the youth is busy with sex, and theadult is busy with worries. How few are busy with God!”Banish the imaginary hope that happiness will come from worldly fulfillments.Prosperity isn’t enough, “gracious living” isn’t enough. You want to beeternally happy. Seize the God within you and realize that the Self is Divinity.You must be able to answer with surety the highest question of yourintelligence: “Whence did I come?”God and immortality are not myths. It is the gravest insult to the Self withinyou to die believing you are a mortal being. How long will you let yourselves,sons of God, be helplessly mowed down by the sickle of death because you nevertried during your lifetime to conquer maya,7[part0010_split_000.html#footnote-006] ignorance?Reason Gives Man the Power to Seek GodThere is a God. He has given man independence, power, and reason. Man can findthe Lord because of the gift of reason. To spend your time just playing withlife and not finding God is wasting the divinely bestowed power within you.Use the key of reason. It is not found in stones and animals. God gave manreason that he might find freedom from the delusion of mortality. If you letyour reason be trampled by ego and wrong habits, what then? If people bow toyour will, what then? Happiness still eludes you. That is why Jesus chose Godinstead of Satan when the Devil tried to tempt him. Jesus realized that althoughworldly power has many attractions, it does not last. He had found somethinggreater than all the riches of this universe. The things that most men desireare perishable. But God will never leave Jesus. He is still enjoying theomnipresent divine kingdom. So should each one of us choose the life that leadsto God.You are punishing the soul by keeping it buried, slumbering in matter life afterlife, frightened by nightmares of suffering and death. Realize that you are thesoul! Remember that the Feeling behind your feeling, the Will behind your will,the Power behind your power, the Wisdom behind your wisdom is the Infinite Lord.Unite the heart’s feeling and the mind’s reason in a perfect balance. In thecastle of calmness, again and again cast off identification with earthly titles,and plunge into deep meditation to realize your divine kingship.Look within yourself. Remember, the Infinite is everywhere. Diving deep intosuperconsciousness,8 [part0010_split_000.html#footnote-005] you can speed yourmind through eternity; by the power of mind you can go farther than the fartheststar. The searchlight of mind is fully equipped to throw its superconscious raysinto the innermost heart of Truth. Use it to do so.Remember, it is you who must travel to the kingdom of heaven; it will not cometo you by special delivery. Each man has to hie his own way alone. From this daymake a resolution in your heart to seek God. When many devotees follow the pathto Him, there will arise a “United States of the World,”9[part0010_split_000.html#footnote-004] with God and His love as man’s Directorand Guide.I want to give you more than the temporary inspiration of words alone; I want toshoot star-shells of wisdom straight into your spiritual darkness, that by theirbursting light you may see for yourself the truth of what I have said.The Two Paths: Activity and MeditationTo summarize, there are basically two approaches to God-realization: the outerway and the inner, or transcendental way. The outer way is by right activity,loving and serving mankind with the consciousness centered in God; thetranscendental way is by deep esoteric meditation. By the transcendental way yourealize all the things you are not, and discover That which you are: “I am notthe breath; I am not the body, neither bones nor flesh. I am not the mind orfeeling. I am That which is behind the breath, body, mind, and feeling.” Whenyou go beyond the consciousness of this world, knowing that you are not the bodyor the mind, and yet aware as never before that you exist—that divineconsciousness is what you are. You are That in which is rooted everything in theuniverse.Why not inquire behind the darkness when you close your eyes? That is the placeto explore. “And the light shineth in the darkness; and the darknesscomprehended it not.”10 [part0010_split_000.html#footnote-003] Vast lights andcosmic forces are moving there.Skyfuls of Eternal Bliss Will Be OpenedSamadhi11 [part0010_split_000.html#footnote-002] is a joyous experience, asplendid light in which you behold the countless worlds floating in a vast bedof joy and bliss. Banish the spiritual ignorance that makes you think thismortal life is real. Have these beautiful experiences for yourself in eternalsamadhi, in God. Auroras of light, skyfuls of eternal bliss will be opened toyou.All great teachers declare that within this body is the immortal soul, a sparkof That which sustains all. He who knows his soul knows this truth: “I am beyondeverything finite; I now see that the Spirit, alone in space with Its ever newjoy, has expressed Itself as the vast body of nature. I am the stars, I am thewaves, I am the Life of all; I am the laughter within all hearts, I am the smileon the faces of flowers and in each soul. I am the Wisdom and Power that sustainall creation.”Realize that! My words may remain vibrating within you; but if you sleep on indelusion, you will not know it. If you awaken, you will be conscious that thetruth I have spoken is ever throbbing within your soul. Meditate. Learn thisliberating lesson. Wait no more. I came here not to entertain you with worldlyfestivities12 [part0010_split_000.html#footnote-001] but to arouse your sleepingmemory of immortality. You do not realize the pain that comes to those whoremain in delusion. I suffer for you, and will do everything to help you realizethat illumination is within.Free yourself forever![../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0010_split_000.html#footnote-012-backlink] From the Sanskrit vid, “toknow.” The Vedas comprise a voluminous scripture of 100,000 couplets.

We have seeminglybecome separated from our Father, and we must consciously reunite with Him. Yogateaches us how to rise above the delusion of separation and realize our onenesswith God. The poet Milton wrote of the soul of man and how it might regainparadise. That is the purpose and goal of Yoga—to regain the lost paradise ofsoul consciousness by which man knows that he is, and ever has been, one withSpirit.The world’s various religions are based more or less on the beliefs of man. Butthe true basis of religion should be a science that all devotees may apply inorder to reach our one Father-God. Yoga is that science. The practice of ascience of religion is imperative. Different dogmatic “isms” have kept mankinddivided, although Jesus pointed out: “If a house be divided against itself, thathouse cannot stand.”1 [part0011_split_000.html#footnote-026] Unity among variousreligions may be brought about only when the individuals who practice thosereligions become actually aware of God within. Then we shall have a truebrotherhood of man under the Fatherhood of God.The great religions of the world all preach the necessity of finding God, ofbrotherhood among men; and all have a moral code, such as the Ten Commandments.What, then, creates the differences among them? It is the bigotry in men’sminds. Not by concentrating on dogma may we reach God, but by actual soulknowledge. When men perceive the universal truths underlying various religions,there will be no more difficulties over dogma. To me there is neither Jew, norChristian, nor Hindu; all are my brothers. I worship in all temples, for each ofthem has been erected to honor my Father.We should begin to build world unity with the idea that has been initiated bySelf-Realization Fellowship: a “Church of All Religions”; not eclecticism, butrespect for all religions as constituting various paths to God. Such temples,dedicated to the one God that all religions worship, should be built everywhere.I predict that this will come about. East and West should destroy forever narrowdivisions in the houses of God. Attaining Self-realization through Yoga, menwill come to know that they are all children of the one Father.The Blind Cannot Lead the BlindThat unity of spirit is demonstrated in great men, those with God-realization.The blind cannot lead the blind; only a master,2[part0011_split_000.html#footnote-025] one who knows God, may rightly teachothers about Him. To regain one’s divinity one must have such a master or guru.3[part0011_split_000.html#footnote-024] He who faithfully follows a true gurubecomes like him, for the guru helps to elevate the disciple to his own level ofrealization. When I found my guru, Swami Sri Yukteswarji,4[part0011_split_000.html#footnote-023] I made up my mind to follow his example:to place God alone on the altar of my heart, and to share Him with others.The Hindu masters taught that to gain the deepest knowledge one should focus hisgaze through the omniscient spiritual eye. When concentrating hard, even thenon-yogi wrinkles his forehead at the point between the eyebrows—the center ofconcentration and of the spherical spiritual eye, the seat of soul intuition.That is the real “crystal ball” into which the yogi gazes to learn the secretsof the universe. Those who go deep enough in their concentration will penetratethat “third” eye and see God. Seekers of truth therefore should develop theability to project their perception through the spiritual eye. The practice ofYoga helps the aspirant to open the single eye of intuitive consciousness.5[part0011_split_000.html#footnote-022]Intuition or direct knowledge does not depend on any data from the senses. Thatis why the intuitive faculty is often called the “sixth sense.” Everyone hasthis sixth sense, but most people do not develop it. However, almost everyonehas had some intuitional experience, perhaps a “feeling” that a particular thingis going to happen, when there is no sensory evidence to indicate it.It is important to develop intuition, or direct soul knowledge, for he who isGod-conscious is sure of himself. He knows, and he knows that he knows. We mustbe sure of God’s presence, as sure as we are that we know the taste of anorange. It was only after my Guru had shown me how to commune with God and afterI had felt His presence every day that I assumed the spiritual duty of tellingothers about Him.The West has emphasized large temples of worship, but there are few in which theworshipers are shown how God may be found. In the East, the emphasis has been onthe development of men of God-realization; but they are in many casesinaccessible to spiritual seekers, remaining in seclusion in remote and solitaryabodes. Spiritual centers in which people may commune with God, and teachers whocan show people how to do so, are both necessary. How may one receive knowledgeof God from a teacher who himself does not know God? My Guru impressed upon methe necessity of knowing the Heavenly Father before trying to tell others aboutHim. How grateful I am to have received his training! He himself truly communedwith God.The Lord must first be perceived in one’s own bodily temple. Every seeker shoulddaily discipline his thoughts and place on the altar of his soul the wildflowersof his devotion. He who finds God within will be able to feel His presence inevery church or temple he enters.Yoga Converts Theology to Practical ExperienceYoga enables man to perceive the truth in all religions. The Ten Commandmentsare preached, in various words, in every religion. But the two greatestcommandments are those emphasized by Jesus: “Love the Lord thy God with all thyheart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind,” and “Thou shalt love thyneighbor as thyself.”6 [part0011_split_000.html#footnote-021]Loving God “with all thy mind” means withdrawing one’s attention from the sensesand giving it to God; giving to Him one’s whole concentration in meditation.Every seeker of God must learn to concentrate. A prayer that one utters while atthe same time thinking of other things in the background of the mind is not atrue prayer and is unheeded by God. Yoga teaches that in order to find theFather it is first necessary to seek Him with all one’s mind, with concentrationthat is one-pointed.Some people say that the Hindus are more adapted to the practice of Yoga, thatYoga is not suited to Westerners. This is not true. Many Westerners are atpresent in a better position to practice Yoga than many Hindus are, becausescientific advancements have given Westerners much free time. India should moreand more utilize the progressive material methods of the West to make lifeeasier and freer; and the West should take from India the practical metaphysicalmethods of Yoga whereby every man may find his way to God. Yoga is not a sectbut a universally applicable science by which we can find our Father.Yoga is for everybody, for the people of the West as well as for those of theEast. One would not say that the telephone is not for the East just because itwas invented in the West. Similarly, the methods of Yoga, although developed inthe East, are not exclusively for the East but are useful to all mankind.Whether a man is born in India or in America, he someday has to die. Why notlearn how to “die daily” in God, like St. Paul?7[part0011_split_000.html#footnote-020] Yoga teaches the method. Man lives in thebody as a prisoner; when his term is over, he suffers the indignity of beingthrown out. Love of the body is therefore nothing more than love of jail. Longaccustomed to living in the body, we have forgotten what real freedom means.Being a Westerner is no excuse for not seeking freedom. It is vital to every manthat he discover his soul and know his immortal nature. Yoga shows the way.The Soul Must Reascend to GodBefore creation existed there was Cosmic Consciousness: Spirit or God, theAbsolute, ever-existing, ever-conscious, ever-new Bliss beyond form andmanifestation. When creation came into being, Cosmic Consciousness “descended”into the physical universe where it manifests as Christ Consciousness:8[part0011_split_000.html#footnote-019] the omnipresent pure reflection of God’sintelligence and consciousness inherent and hidden within all creation. When theChrist Consciousness descends into the physical body of man it becomes soul, orsuperconsciousness: the ever-existing, ever-conscious, ever-new bliss of Godindividualized by encasement in the body. When the soul becomes identified withthe body, it manifests as ego, mortal consciousness. Yoga teaches that the soulmust climb back up the ladder of consciousness to Spirit.9[part0011_split_000.html#footnote-018]Secret of Happiness Is Consciousness of God’s PresenceIt is all right to enjoy life; the secret of happiness is not to become attachedto anything. Enjoy the smell of the flower, but see God in it. I have kept theconsciousness of the senses only that in using them I may always perceive andthink of God. “Mine eyes were made to behold Thy beauty everywhere. My ears weremade to hear Thine omnipresent voice.” That is yoga, union with God. It is notnecessary to go to the forest to find Him. Worldly habits will hold us fastwherever we may be until we free ourselves from them. The yogi learns to findGod in the cave of his heart. Wherever he goes, he carries with him the blissfulconsciousness of God’s presence.Man has not only descended into mortal sense consciousness but has become boundby abnormalities of that sense consciousness, such as greed, anger, andjealousy. Man must banish these abnormalities in order to find God. BothEasterners and Westerners should be free from sense slavery. An ordinary man maybecome angry because his morning coffee hasn’t been brought to him and he issure the deprivation will give him a headache. He is a slave of his habits. Thedeveloped yogi is free.Everyone can be a yogi, right where he is now. But we are prone to think strangeand difficult anything that is beyond the horizon of our own habits of life. Wedo not consider how our habits may appear to others!The practice of Yoga leads to freedom. Some yogis carry this idea ofnon-attachment to extremes. They teach that one should be able to lie on a bedof nails without discomfort, and other forms of tapasya, physical discipline. Itis true that one who can sit on a bed of nails and think of God shows greatstrength of mind. But such feats are not necessary. One may just as well sit ina comfortable chair and meditate on God.Patanjali10 [part0011_split_000.html#footnote-017] teaches that any posture thatkeeps the spine erect is good for meditation, yogic concentration on God. It isnot necessary to go through physical contortions or to practice exercisesrequiring extraordinary physical endurance and suppleness, as is advocated inHatha Yoga. God is the objective; consciousness of His presence is what weshould work toward. The Bhagavad Gita says: “He who with devotion absorbshimself in Me, with his soul immersed in Me, him I regard, among all classes ofyogis, as the most equilibrated.”11 [part0011_split_000.html#footnote-016]Hindu yogis have been known to demonstrate obliviousness to extremes of heat andcold, and to mosquitoes and other annoying insects. Such a demonstration is nota requisite of being a yogi, but it is natural achievement of the adept. Try toeliminate disturbing elements; or to endure them, if necessary, without beingdisturbed inwardly by them. If one can remain clean, it is pointless to bedirty. One may become attached to living in a hut as well as to living in apalace.The greatest factor in achieving spiritual success is willingness. Jesus said,“The harvest truly is plenteous, but the laborers are few.”12[part0011_split_000.html#footnote-015] People of the world seek the gifts ofGod, but he who is wise seeks the Giver Himself.To be a yogi is to meditate. The yogi doesn’t think first of food for his bodyupon waking each morning; he feeds his soul with the ambrosia of God-communion.Filled with the inspiration found by his deeply diving meditative mind, he isable to perform happily all the duties of the day.God made this earth as it is on purpose; in His plan it is man’s part to makethe world better. The Westerner tends to go to extremes in keeping constantlybusy getting new and improved material comforts. The Easterner tends to go toextremes in being satisfied with what he has. There is something appealing aboutboth the go-ahead spirit of the West and the easy, calm spirit of the East. Weshould take the balanced road between.Meditation Makes the YogiTo find God, one should meditate every morning and night, and whenever there isa little spare time during the day. In addition, it is important to meditate forsix hours on one day out of the week. This is not unreasonable; some peoplepractice at the piano for ten hours every day of the week, and think nothing ofit. To become a spiritual master, it is necessary to give more time to God. Wehave to make Him feel that we love Him more than anything else. When you becomeexperienced in meditation, able to go deep into superconsciousness, five hoursof sleep are enough. The rest of the night should be used for meditation. Onecan use nights and early mornings and holidays for meditating on God. In thisway anyone, even the busy Westerner, can be a yogi. So become a Western yogi.You don’t have to wear a turban or to have long hair like me!We need the “hives” of churches, but we also need to fill the churches with the“honey” of our own Self-realization.13 [part0011_split_000.html#footnote-014]God is present in the churches too, of course; but your just going there willnot persuade Him to reveal Himself. Churchgoing is good, but daily meditation isbetter still. Do both, because you will certainly have inspiration from going tochurch; and from daily meditation you will receive even greater upliftment. Itis when a devotee’s heart is afire and when he throws shell after shell ofprayer that God surrenders to him. That unceasing devotion is essential tofinding Him. In order to be a yogi and still keep pace with the modern world, itis necessary to meditate at home, to discipline oneself, and to perform allduties with the attitude that they are a service to God.My greatest desire is to build temples of God in the souls of men; to see thesmile of God on men’s faces. The most important of all life’s accomplishments isto establish a temple of God in one’s own soul. And it can be easily done. Thatis why Self-Realization Fellowship was sent to the West.Anyone who has established God in his soul temple is a yogi. He can say, withme, that Yoga is for the East, North, South, and West—for all people, that theymay follow the byways of theology to join the highway of Yoga. The right roadleads to the palace of God’s bliss. He who once reaches there shall “go no moreout.”14 [part0011_split_000.html#footnote-013][../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0011_split_000.html#footnote-026-backlink] Mark 3:25.2 [part0011_split_000.html#footnote-025-backlink] One who is a master ofhimself—of the mind, emotions, senses, passions.

Having thus united thyself to Me as thy Highest Goal, thoushalt be Mine Own” (IX:34); and “The best type of yogi is he who feels forothers, whether in grief or pleasure, even as he feels for himself” (VI:32).7 [part0011_split_000.html#footnote-020-backlink] I Corinthians 15:31.8 [part0011_split_000.html#footnote-019-backlink] The Hindu scriptures refer toChrist Consciousness as Kutastha Chaitanya, universal consciousness oromnipresent intelligence.9 [part0011_split_000.html#footnote-018-backlink] Yoga teaches that the abode ofthe soul—of man’s life and divine consciousness—is in the subtle spiritualcenters in the brain: Sahasrara, the thousand-petaled lotus at the top of thecerebrum, seat of cosmic consciousness; Kutastha, at the point between theeyebrows, seat of Christ consciousness; and the medullary center (connected bypolarity to the Kutastha), seat of superconsciousness. Descending into the body(and body consciousness) from these centers of highest spiritual perception,life and consciousness flow down the spine, passing through five astral spinalcenters (see chakras [part0074.html#_idTextAnchor094] in glossary) and branchingoutward into the physical organs of life, sensory perception, and action.To regain the blissful realization of its oneness with God, the soul of man mustretrace its downward course, ascending by the sacred spinal route to its home inthe higher cerebral centers of divine awareness. This is accomplished by thepractice of guru-given scientific techniques of yogic meditation, such as may belearned from the Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons[part0070.html#_idTextAnchor081].10 [part0011_split_000.html#footnote-017-backlink] Foremost exponent of Yoga.Patanjali’s date is unknown, though many scholars assign him to the secondcentury b.c.11 [part0011_split_000.html#footnote-016-backlink] VI:47.12 [part0011_split_000.html#footnote-015-backlink] Matthew 9:37.13 [part0011_split_000.html#footnote-014-backlink] Knowing one’s Self as thesoul, and that the soul is one with God.14 [part0011_split_000.html#footnote-013-backlink] Revelation 3:12."},{"pageContent":"lectures and classes [../images/00007.jpeg]lectures and classes [../images/00008.jpeg]lectures and classes [../images/00009.jpeg]During the years 1920 through 1935, Paramahansa Yogananda conducted extensivelectures and classes to capacity audiences in major cities across the UnitedStates.

Powerful as they are, their scope is insufficient to contain Him. Sothe human mind is incapable of a true conception of God. The question “Who madeGod?” arises only because mind cannot comprehend That which has neitherbeginning nor end.When you are looking at the sun millions of miles away in the sky, that hugeluminary seems smaller by far than our earth. Yet the diameter of earth isroughly 7,900 miles; and the sun is more than a hundred times that wide. If youcould place our planet next to the sun, earth would appear by comparison a tinydot. Let us suppose the giant solar orb is expanding, growing more and morehuge, until the vast blue expanse of the sky is entirely swallowed up by itsmass. The space thus filled is nevertheless but a particle, a mere speck, of thespace that spreads through countless universes and into infinity. Were the sunto go on endlessly enlarging in space, still it would not be able to take themeasure of infinity. The cosmic delusion of finitude prevents the mind fromconceiving such vastness. Where are its boundaries? Whence came this endlessvoid? The Originless Immeasurable is God. Omnipresent in the farthest reaches ofspace, He is in the distant stars, and in you and me; and He is conscious everymoment of every place He is.God is not mind—He created it and He is beyond it. Otherwise we could conceiveHim in our minds. We can accurately call Him Divine Consciousness, Divine Joy,Divine Existence, but not mind.Though mind is incapable of encompassing Omnipresence, it is nevertheless ableto feel God. Feeling His presence and measuring it are two differentexperiences. The wave cannot measure the ocean, but there is a point of contactbetween them. So where the Infinite becomes the finite there is a point ofcontact: the superconscious mind. That mind can feel God. When we expand theordinary mind until it impinges on the superconscious mind, we are able to feelHis presence.We Have Descended From the Infinite Into the FiniteWe have descended from the Infinite into the finite. Yoga is withdrawal of theattention from externals in order to focus it on the inner source of Truth. Onlyin this way can we discover how God has condensed His consciousness into themultitudinous finite forms of His creatures and the universes they inhabit. Thehuman body is the most intricate of all His creations. A single original cell,the united sperm and ovum, divides; and by multiplication of the process buildsup trillions of cells around itself to create the bodily temple that houses ourdivine soul consciousness.You don’t realize how much energy is locked in even one little gram of flesh.Its release would spread countless electrons far into space.1[part0012.html#footnote-039] And the power and extent of the consciousness thatis present in the body is beyond human conception. Though externally we are madeof flesh, behind its gross cells are electrical currents, life currents. Andbehind these subtle energies are the thoughts and perceptions.Thought is inexhaustible. Since the world began, thoughts in unimaginablenumbers have passed through the ether. One could not begin to count them, but itis possible to get some idea if you reflect on how many thoughts and feelingsyou express during your own lifetime. Millions! Try to remember all you havethought in just one year, or even in one day. Consider the accumulation ofthoughts of every human being through unrecorded ages past. God knows them all!Mind cannot measure even the subtle phenomena of nature. How many electronswhirl in the electricity that flows into the light bulbs here in the chapel?Trillions, dancing together, make this light you behold. These ultramicroscopicparticles are moving at a speed equivalent to traveling from here to New York,or to any other part of the world, in a few seconds. Scientific experiments areproving this.If you try to calculate how many protons and electrons are condensed in ourearth, the mind goes only so far and then stops. What is revealed to thesearching mind seems infinite, but there is a point beyond which ideas becometoo subtle to follow. From that sphere where the mind cannot penetrate, God ispouring forth His essential Light—the Cosmic Intelligent Vibration thatstructures finite creation.God’s True Nature Known Only Through IntuitionIf we use the mind properly, we can understand how God is beyond mind andintellect; and how His true nature can be felt only through the soul’s power ofintuition. We must find His consciousness through the superconscious mind—thenucleus of mind and intelligence. His infinite nature is revealed to man throughthe intuitive superconsciousness of the soul. The joy felt in meditation revealsthe presence of Eternal Joy spread over all creation. The light seen inmeditation is the astral light2 [part0012.html#footnote-038] from which ourtangible creation is made. Beholding this light, one feels a unity with allthings.The ordinary person lives in the world but is relatively unconscious of itsnature and purpose. A life of such limited perception is not unlike that of theanimals. We used to have here at Mt. Washington a goat that was invariablyattracted by my voice. One day, while I was speaking in this chapel, the goatcame trotting in and right on up the aisle to me! I am sure it didn’t know whatI was saying; it simply liked to hear my voice. But you come to these lecturesnot only to listen to the words, but also to feel the presence of God behindthem. If you attune your consciousness with His consciousness, and remain inthat current of bliss, you will feel at-onement with Him. Whatever understandingI have attained has been acquired by becoming attuned to God’s consciousnesswithin. This you too can accomplish.As one develops spiritually and realizes his kinship with all that lives, hisresponsibility to share the suffering of others increases. Jesus was willingeven to suffer in sharing the afflictions of others; we too must do what we canfor those who are shivering with cold and disease. It is a nightmare for them;and whatever of their woes we can remove, we are removing them from God also. Heis not happy when His children are in misery, for He suffers in them.At this moment most of you are enjoying beauty and peace, but think of those inLouisville today! Thousands are suffering there because of the floods. Once longago I was thinking how wonderful America is, without the disasters that afflictso many countries; then God showed me the floods that are occurring now. Thevibrations of the thoughts3 [part0012.html#footnote-037] and feelings ofthousands being killed in the fighting in Spain have caused atmospheric changesthat are responsible for these floods and other disasters around the world. Warspews out vibrations of wrong that throw all nature out of balance and harmony,causing “natural” catastrophes.God gave freedom to man, and man has misused that freedom; this is the cause ofall suffering. The misuse of our God-given free will has terrifyingconsequences. I would rather someone tell me that I am about to do wrong, thanallow me to act and not wake up until years later to the harm I had done.Satan Created Ignorance, Cause of All SufferingSuffering is therefore not the work of God, but of Satan’s power of maya,delusion. This force creates the ignorance that blinds people to theconsequences of their actions, causing them to err and thus bring suffering uponthemselves. Those who are fighting in Spain—both the government forces and theiropponents—think they are trying to do right. The only way to avoid error is todevelop the discriminative wisdom to know what is wrong, and then resolve not todo it. One wrong fighting another wrong doesn’t make a right. The true enemy ofman is ignorance. It must be driven from this earth.We have everything necessary in the world today to bring about the millennium.Only man’s selfishness makes it impossible. Tremendous unnecessary suffering iscreated by man’s shortsighted self-interest. Money that could feed and clotheneedy people is used instead for destruction. The root cause of the world’stroubles is this selfishness born of ignorance. Each person thinks he is doingright; but when he seeks to satisfy only his own interest, he is setting inmotion the karmic law4 [part0012.html#footnote-036] of cause and effect thatwill inevitably destroy his own and others’ happiness.The more I see of world tragedies caused by man’s ignorance, the more I realizethat even if every street were paved with gold, happiness would not be lasting.Happiness lies in making others happy, in forsaking self-interest to bring joyto others. If each one would do that, then everyone would be happy; and allwould be taken care of. That is what Jesus meant when he said: “All thingswhatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.”5[part0012.html#footnote-035]A federation of all religions and all nations is necessary. But such a unionwill come only when every individual engages in that meditation which leads todirect contact with God. Communion with Him is the solution. When one hasrealized God, he no longer feels that others are different from himself. Unlesssuch wisdom comes, not to just a few, but to all men, there will be no freedomon earth. Even here in America freedom is not total; suffering still abounds.Each one of us has a responsibility to bring peace and happiness to our countryand to all men. One should care, not only for his own nation, but all countries;not only for one’s own family, but for all mankind. The ordinary man’s interestis limited to himself and his surroundings, but the man of God identifies withthe whole world. Don’t think the contribution made by your spiritualizedconsciousness is small. Your part may mean very much.In order to know God you must become like Him. In spite of our transgressions,in spite of our forgetfulness of God and great indifference to Him, still Helovingly gives us life and all that supports life in this world. Nothing isgreater than God; indifference to Him is the highest sin.Those who are not willing to give up all they have to find Him, will not knowHim. Whoever would know God must be able to forsake all else for Him. Jesus wastrying to make his disciples understand this truth when he told them to keepwatch and pray with him at Gethsemane. But when they fell asleep, he sadlyobserved: “The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”6[part0012.html#footnote-034]Man is like a puppet. The strings of his habits, emotions, passions, and sensesmake him dance to their bidding. They bind his soul. He who is unwilling orunable to cut himself free in order to know God will not find Him. I see myselfapart from these attachments. I eat, and sometimes I don’t eat; I sleep, andsometimes I don’t sleep. I gave up all physical necessities to prove to myselfthat I do not need them. God doesn’t eat or sleep; He isn’t bound by senses andhabits. That is what makes Him God; and we are made in His image. We should beable to give up everything to know Him: “Seek ye the kingdom of God; and allthese things shall be added unto you.”7 [part0012.html#footnote-033] Despite allthe tests I have gone through for Him, in the end God has given me everything Iwanted or needed of this world. And I have given it all back, for He hasbestowed on me a gift infinitely greater: Divine Joy, day and night. In that Joyall desires that come into my heart are satisfied.Meditation Lifts the Fog of IgnoranceIn the Bhagavad Gita, recorded by Sage Vyasa, Lord Krishna explains that if yourinnate wisdom is covered over with ignorance, you are deluded and thus stumblethrough life: “Tamasic [ignorant] action is that which is instituted throughdelusion, without measuring one’s ability, and disregarding theconsequences—loss to oneself of health, wealth, and influence, and harm toothers.”8 [part0012.html#footnote-032] When the fog of ignorance is removed bymeditation you will see the right path. You will be troubled no more; you willfind fulfillment eternal. “Verily, nothing else in this world is as sanctifyingas wisdom. In due course of time, the devotee who is successful in yoga[meditation] will spontaneously realize this within his Self.”9[part0012.html#footnote-031]These truths are all real to me. Truth is Reality. Self-realization is notsomething one can learn from books; it comes only through personal experience.Realization of truth, experience of God—not dogma merely—is what every religionshould bring to its followers. What Jesus Christ realized, we too mustexperience. He didn’t teach that his followers should worship him as apersonality, but rather experience what he experienced in his oneness with God.That can be attained only by meditation and by following God’s laws. To worshipJesus because he is Jesus is not enough. Embrace the universal ideals he taught,and strive to be like him.We are here on earth in this particular body-form for just a little while, tolearn our lessons and move on. Whither are we headed now? Think how many pageshave already been turned in the Lord’s dream novel of creation! When I visitedSalt Lake City I saw in vision a great ocean, and mammoths walking on the shore.Later I learned that the skeleton of an ancient mammoth had recently been foundthere.As human beings we have God-given power to cast away every habit and limitationand spread our consciousness throughout creation, penetrating not only thehearts of all creatures, but reaching out beyond the stars. Our native vastnessencompasses even greater space. Such tremendous possibility lies within us! Weare infinite! I live in that sphere of infinity, and am conscious of the bodyonly once in a while.You are limited now; but when by deep, daily meditation you become able totransfer your consciousness from the finite to the Infinite, you will be free.You are not meant to be a prisoner of the body. You are a child of God; you mustlive up to that divine birthright.Give God First Place in Your HeartWherever your mind is, that is where you will spend your time. What if God hadnot given you the power to play or read or work? You could do nothing. So Heshould come first in your life. God knows what is in your heart; give Him firstplace there.The only way to catch God is by love. Meditate upon Him, and then deeply pray:“Lord, I cannot live without You. You are the Power behind my consciousness. Ilove You. Reveal Yourself to me.” When you give up sleep to meditate upon Him,when you forsake selfishness and cry because of His suffering in your brothers,He comes to you. When you actually sacrifice for Him, He is caught in the net ofyour love. Nothing else can capture Him.Knowledge prepares the way to love. You cannot love that which you do not know.Knowledge of God must therefore precede love for Him. That knowledge comes bypractice of Kriya Yoga,10 [part0012.html#footnote-030] the technique that LahiriMahasaya gave. When you know God, you will love Him; and when you love Him, youwill surrender yourself to Him.Until your devotion for God and awareness of Him become complete, don’t rest;don’t give in to sleep when you should be meditating. Never give anythingpreference before God! His love is the greatest love there is. So long as youlet other things come first, He will wait. But your delay may be too long, andyour suffering may be great. Don’t procrastinate. Be certain in the sincerity ofyour conscience that you have made the effort to commune with Him. Don’t rest,don’t give up until you can see Him with your own eyes, or feel Him in yourheart. Birth, play, marriage, children, old age—life is finished. That is notliving! Life is much deeper and more wonderful than that, I have found. When youknow God, there is no more sorrow. All those you loved and lost in death arewith you again in the Eternal Life. You don’t know whom to consider your “own”anymore, because everyone is yours.The beauty of God is vast. To enjoy flowers for their loveliness is good, butfar greater is to see behind their purity and beauty the face of God. To becarried away by music for its own sake cannot compare with hearing God’screative Voice in it. Though God is immanent in the finite beauties of creation,it is wisdom to realize one’s eternal Self beyond form and finitude. You knowhow fond I am of our grounds at the Mount Washington and Encinitas ashrams.11[part0012.html#footnote-029] I never tire of their beauty. But the Lord gave mean awakening experience recently. I inwardly saw people sitting about andtalking. One of them proposed some activity, but another said, “No,Paramahansaji taught that we must not do that.” I suddenly realized that thiswas a vision of years to come, after I was no longer here in this body. For amoment I was shaken; then I came back to ordinary consciousness.There is no use in becoming attached to anything in this world. So many thingscome and go in the Lord’s cosmic drama. I see airfields destroyed, and the seafilled with dead, and many other things to come. In my heart I see a worldwithout me. That freedom God gives ultimately to every soul.One great saint said, “I care not where I may be, O Lord, but punish me not withobliviousness of Thee.” There is no greater punishment. Jesus said: “It isbetter for thee to enter into life maimed.”12 [part0012.html#footnote-028] Allsuffering can be taken away by the contact of God.Awake From the Nightmare of SufferingIn a dream you may see yourself running down a street, pursued by an enemy.Suddenly you are shot, and you think, “Oh, how terrible! I am dying! I am sad toleave this world.” Then you see yourself dead. The undertaker cremates yourbody, and your friends come to mourn when the ashes are laid away. But suddenlyyou wake up and see that it was only a dream. You are alive! This is similar towhat happens at death.God showed me in a vision that those who are dying in the fighting in Spain areonly dreaming a terrible dream of death. As soon as their consciousness islifted from the body, they awake as from a nightmare, and are glad to be free ofit. Our life experiences are all part of a dream. Man himself has created thenightmare of war. But after its victims have been thrown from their bodies, theyrealize it was only a horrible dream from which they have awakened. They knowthey are not dead. This is a great metaphysical truth.If you know you are dreaming, you don’t suffer from your bad experiences in thedream. But if you are identified with the dream, and in it someone strikes yourhead and kills you, that dream death seems a true and terrible experience untilyou wake up and understand it was not real. It is the same after death. Once youare out of this body, you realize you are not dead; you are free of a nightmare.So death is not the end; it is a freeing of the consciousness from imprisonmentin the physical dream-body. That release brings a sense of great freedom. Weshould never seek death. Rather, we should prepare our consciousness bymeditation and God-communion, so that when death comes, in its own time, we areable to look upon it as a dream, nothing more. I can see the dream nature oflife and death anytime I wish. Hence I attach little importance to this body.In Oneness With God Know That Life Is a DreamLive in the consciousness of Spirit, in that oneness with God wherein you knowthat life is a dream. It is very easy to do when you make the effort. Whensuffering comes it is more difficult to detach your consciousness fromidentification with the body; so be wise and make the effort now, while you havestrength and health.Material desires take away the desire for the Infinite. Every day or so someonetells me I need this or that. It seems ridiculous, because I know that thousandsdo not have what I am told I “need.” If they don’t need it, why should I? Youronly real need is God; there is no other necessity. Be not attached topossessions, music, books, food, or any other sense pleasures. In God you haveeternal life. Become aware of this great truth; otherwise your appointments inlife will take over, and you will die still bound by them. If you are one withHim, you are not compelled to return to this dream earth again. You are free tocome and go as you like,13 [part0012.html#footnote-027] to serve God in Hischildren on earth.If you live in the joy of God, you will not know what death is. You do not getto that state when you pray mechanically. Become completely absorbed in yourprayer, with faith that God is listening. If you thus fervently, lovingly prayto God, He will come to you at any time.[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0012.html#footnote-039-backlink] The awesome power of the release ofnuclear energy was first demonstrated under controlled conditions within a fewyears after this talk, when the first atomic bomb was exploded at Alamogordo,New Mexico, on July 16, 1945.2 [part0012.html#footnote-038-backlink] Everything on the material plane has acounterpart made of astral light, a light that is more subtle than theelectromagnetic energies of the atom.

Havingthen transcended the Lord’s delusion, the soul is forever freed. “Their thoughtsimmersed in That (Spirit), their souls one with Spirit, their sole allegianceand devotion given to Spirit, their beings purified from poisonous delusion bythe antidote of wisdom—such men reach the state of nonreturn” (Bhagavad GitaV:17). In the Bible it is similarly written: “Him that overcometh will I make apillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out” (Revelation 3:12).A soul who returns to earth after attaining liberation, incarnates of his ownfree will as a master, to help liberate others. Such voluntary returns arecalled vyutthana, reversion to earthly life after maya has ceased to blind. Suchincarnations are rare in any age."},{"pageContent":"Answered PrayersSelf-Realization Fellowship International Headquarters, Los Angeles, California,October 19, 1939Having come to this world from we know not where, we naturally wonder about theorigin and purpose of life. We hear about a Creator, read about Him, but knownot any way to contact Him. We only know that the entire universe depicts Hisintelligence. Just as the intricate works of a tiny watch arouse our admirationfor the watchmaker, and the huge complicated machines in a factory cause us tomarvel at their inventor, so when we see nature’s wonders we feel awed by thehidden intelligence behind them. We ask ourselves: Who made the flower a livingform, reaching out to the sun? Whence came its fragrance and beauty? How wereits petals formed so perfectly, and tinged with lovely colors?At night the stars and the moon, shedding silvery light around us, move us toreflection on the intelligence guiding these celestial bodies through the sky.The moon’s soft light is insufficient for the activities of the day; thus abenign intelligence suggests to us that we rest at night. Then the sun comes up,and its bright light makes us look clearly and squarely at the world around us,and at our responsibility to satisfy the needs that beset us.There are two ways in which our needs can be taken care of. One is the material.For example, when we have ill health we can go to a doctor for medicaltreatment. But a time comes when no human aid can help. Then we look to theother way, to the Spiritual Power, the Maker of our body, mind, and soul.Material power is limited, and when it fails, we turn to the unlimited DivinePower. Likewise with our financial needs; when we have done our best, and stillit is inadequate, we turn to that other Power.Everyone thinks that his problems are the worst. Some feel more oppressed thanothers because their resistance is weaker. Because of differences in theirmental power, people put forth varying amounts of energy. If one has a verygreat difficulty and his mind is weak, he will not succeed in overcoming theproblem. A man whose mind is powerful could break down the barriers of thatdifficulty. Even so, the mightiest men have sometimes met failure. Whenoverwhelming material, mental, or spiritual troubles beset us, we realize howlimited are the powers of life in this physical world.Our endeavor must be not only to acquire financial security and good health, butto seek out the meaning of life. What is it all about? When we are hit withdifficulties we react upon our environment first, making whatever materialadjustments we believe may help. But when we come to the point of saying,“Everything I have tried so far has failed; what to do next?” we start to thinkhard about a solution. When we think deeply enough, we find an answer within.This is one form of answered prayer.Prayer Is a Demand of the SoulPrayer is a demand of the soul. God did not make us beggars; He created us inHis image. The Bible and Hindu scriptures declare it. A beggar who goes to arich home and asks for alms receives a beggar’s share; but the son can haveanything he asks from his wealthy father. Therefore we should not behave likebeggars. Divine ones such as Christ, Krishna, and Buddha did not lie when theysaid we are made in the image of God.Yet we see that some people have everything, seemingly born with a silver spoonin their mouth, whereas others seem to attract failure and troubles. Where isthe image of God in them? The power of Spirit lies within each one of us; thequestion is how to develop it. If you will follow the lesson in my experienceswith God, you are bound to find the result you are seeking. In the past you mayhave been disappointed that your prayers were not answered. But do not losefaith. In order to find out if prayers work or not, you must have in your mindan initial belief in the power of prayer.Your prayers may have gone unanswered because you chose to be a beggar. Also,you should know what you may legitimately ask of your Heavenly Father. You maypray with all your heart and power to own the earth, but your prayer will not begranted, because all prayers connected with material life are limited; they haveto be. God will not break His laws to satisfy whimsical desires. But there is aright way to pray. The cat is said to have nine lives; difficulties haveninety-nine! You have to find the one sure way of killing the cat ofdifficulties. The secret of effective prayer is to change your status frombeggar to child of God; when you appeal to Him from that consciousness, yourprayer will have both power and wisdom.In Will Power Lies the Germ of SuccessMost people become extremely nervous or tense when they are trying to accomplishsomething that means a great deal to them. Anxious, nervous actions do not drawthe power of God; but continuous, calm, powerful use of the will shakes theforces of creation and brings a response from the Infinite. The germ of successin whatever you want to accomplish is in your will power. Will that has beenbadly battered by difficulties becomes temporarily paralyzed. The resolute manwho says, “My body may be broken, but my head of will power remains unbowed,”demonstrates the greatest expression of will.Will power is what makes you divine. When you give up using that will, youbecome a mortal man. Many people say we should not exercise our will to changeconditions, lest we interfere with God’s plan. But why would God give us will ifwe are not to use it? I once met a fanatical man who said he did not believe inusing will power because it developed the ego. “You are using a lot of will nowto resist me!” I replied. “You are using it to talk, and you are obliged to useyour will to stand, or walk, or eat, or go to the movies, or even to go tosleep. You will everything you do. Without will power you would be a mechanicalman.” Non-use of the will is not what Jesus meant when he said: “Not as I will,but as Thou wilt.”1 [part0013.html#footnote-044] He was demonstrating that manmust learn to bend his will, which is governed by desires, to the will of God.Therefore right prayer, when it is persistent, is will.You must believe in the possibility of what you are praying for. If you want ahome, and the mind says, “You simpleton, you can’t afford a house,” you mustmake your will stronger. When the “can’t” disappears from your mind, divinepower comes. A home will not be dropped down to you from heaven; you have topour forth will power continuously through constructive actions. When youpersist, refusing to accept failure, the object of will must materialize. Whenyou continuously work that will through your thoughts and activities, what youare wishing for has to come about. Even though there is nothing in the world toconform to your wish, when your will persists, the desired result will somehowmanifest. In that kind of will lies God’s answer; because will comes from God,and continuous will is divine will.Cauterize the “Can’ts” in Your BrainA weak will is a mortal will. As soon as trials and failure cut it off, it losesits connection with the dynamo of the Infinite. But behind human will is thedivine will that can never fail. Even death has no power to deter divine will.The Lord will definitely answer that prayer behind which the will force iscontinuous. Most people are mentally or physically lazy, or both. When they wantto pray, they think instead of sleep, and when the head nods they dive into bedand that is the end of prayer. The will is buried. Mortal man’s brain is full of“can’ts.” Being born in a family with certain characteristics and habits, he isinfluenced by these to think he can’t do certain things; he can’t walk much, hecan’t eat this, he can’t stand that. Those “can’ts” have to be cauterized. Youhave within you the power to accomplish everything you want; that power lies inthe will.Whoever would develop will power must have good company. If your desire is tobecome a great mathematician, and your customary associates all dislikemathematics, you will certainly be discouraged. But when you mix withaccomplished mathematicians, your will is reinforced; you think, “If others cando it, I can do it.”Don’t immediately jump into big things in your eagerness to develop your will.To succeed, first try out your will on some little thing you thought you couldnot do. If you work hard at it, you can be successful. I remember all the goalsmy friends and many others told me I could never accomplish, but I did. Such“well-wishers” can do much harm. God save us from their kind! Company has thegreatest influence on will. If instead of coming here, you went to a drinkingparty every Thursday, you could not help but pick up something of that worldlyvibration. Your will is definitely inspired or weakened by your company. Todevelop will by yourself is extremely difficult. You require an example beforeyou. If you would be an artist, surround yourself with good paintings andartists. If you would be a divine man, surround yourself with spiritual company.Belief and experience are quite different. A belief comes from what you haveheard or read and accepted as fact, but experience is something you haveactually perceived. The convictions of those who have experienced God cannot beshaken. If you had never tasted an orange, I could fool you about itscharacteristics; but if you had already eaten one, I could not deceive you. Youwould know; you would have had the experience of it.Seek the Company of Those Who Strengthen Your FaithThoughts about God, success, healing, and so on lie in your brain in the form oftabloid tendencies. You should experience them. In order to experience yourthoughts you must use will power to materialize them, and in order to developthe necessary strength of will, you must associate with those who have greatwill power. If you want healing by God’s power, seek the company of those whostrengthen your faith and your will.I traveled throughout India trying to find someone who knew God. Such souls arerare. All the teachers I met told me about their beliefs. But in spiritualmatters I was determined never to be satisfied with words about God. I wanted toexperience Him. What I am told has no meaning for me unless I experience it.Once I was talking with a friend of mine, a broker, about the saints of India.He did not share my enthusiasm. “All these so-called saints are fakes,” he said.“They don’t know God.”I didn’t argue; I changed the subject, and we started to talk about thebrokerage business. When he had told me quite a great deal about it, I saidsmoothly, “Do you know there is not a single reliable broker in Calcutta? Theyare all dishonest.”“What do you know about brokers?” he retorted angrily.“Exactly,” I replied. “What do you know about saints?” He couldn’t answer.“Don’t dispute what you don’t know about,” I went on good-naturedly. “I knownothing about the brokerage business, and you don’t know anything about saints.”The practice of religion has come to a point where very few try to make theirspiritual thoughts a matter of experience. I speak to you only about myexperiences; I do not care to lecture on what I know only intellectually. Mostpersons become self-satisfied about what they have read of Truth, without everhaving experienced it. In India we do not seek spiritual guidance from someonejust because he has a theological degree, nor do we seek out those who have onlystudied the scriptures, without experiencing their truths. Spiritual victrolaswho merely mouth truth do not impress us. We are taught to recognize thedifference between a man’s sermon and his life; he must demonstrate that he hasexperienced what he has learned.Assure Your Ultimate Arrival in HeavenWhen you try to experience your spiritual convictions another world begins toopen up to you. Don’t live in a false sense of security, believing that becauseyou have joined a church you will be saved. You yourself have to make the effortto know God. Your mind may be satisfied that you are very religious, but unlessyour consciousness is satisfied with direct answers to your prayers, no amountof formal religion can save you. Of what benefit is praying to God if He doesnot answer? Difficult though it is to obtain His response, it can be done. Toassure your ultimate arrival in heaven, you must test the power of your prayersuntil you have made them effective. When I was just a little child I made up mymind that when I prayed, my prayer had to be answered. That kind ofdetermination is the way. Every test comes then, to break your will, but God’spower to respond is unlimited; the persistent continuity of your will power willbring His answer.You should learn to concentrate your thoughts. Therefore it is important to havetime to be alone. Avoid the constant company of other people. Most of them arelike sponges; they draw everything out of you, and you seldom receive anythingin return. It is worthwhile to be with others only if they are sincere andstrong, and if each one is conscious of the other’s sincerity and strength, sothat you exchange noble soul qualities.Do not while away your time in idleness. A great many people occupy themselveswith inconsequential activities. Ask them what they have been doing and theywill usually say, “Oh, I have been busy every minute!” But they can scarcelyremember what they were so busy about! Too many diversions, also, weaken yourmental powers. If you go every day to the movies, they will lose theirattraction, and you will become bored. Movies are all basically the same—lovers,heroes, and villains. We may enjoy a beautiful motion picture story, but life isseldom like that; if on the other hand it is too realistic, who wants to seemore of life as it is, when he goes to be entertained?Life is very tricky and we must deal with it as it is. If we do not first masterit ourselves we cannot help anyone else. In the seclusion of concentratedthought lies hidden the factory of all accomplishment. Remember that. In thisfactory continuously weave your will pattern for attaining success over opposingdifficulties. Exercise your will continuously. During the day and at night youhave many opportunities to work in this factory, if you do not waste your time.At night I withdraw from the world’s demands and am by myself, an absolutestranger to the world; it is a blank. Alone with my will power, I turn mythoughts in the desired direction until I have determined in my mind exactlywhat I wish to do and how to do it. Then I harness my will to the rightactivities and it creates success. In this way I have effectively used my willpower many times. But it won’t work unless the application of will power iscontinuous.It is a wonderful feeling to be able to say, and know, “My will power,surcharged by the Divine Will, shall accomplish my aim.” If you lazily leaveeverything to the Divine Power and neglect to use your God-given will, resultswill not be forthcoming. The Divine Power of Its own accord wants to help you;you don’t have to coax. But you do have to use your will to demand as His child,and to behave as His child. You must banish the thought that the Lord with Hiswonderful power is far away in heaven, and that you are a helpless little wormburied in difficulties down here on earth. Remember that behind your will is thegreat Divine Will; but that oceanic Power cannot come to your aid unless you arereceptive.Surcharge Your Will Power Through ConcentrationThe way to become receptive is to sit quietly and concentrate your thoughts on aworthy wish until your mind and thought become completely dissolved in thatidea. Then will power becomes divine—omniscient and omnipotent—and can besuccessfully applied toward realizing your goal. You can’t just sit there andwait for success to fall into your lap; once your course is set and your will isfirm, you have to make a practical effort. Then you will see that whatever yourequire for success starts coming to you. Everything will push you in the rightdirection. In your divinely surcharged will power is the answer to prayer. Whenyou use that will, you open the way through which your prayers can be answered.This is my experience. I used to attempt certain things just to test my willpower; but I don’t do that anymore. I know it works.Once, long ago, I saw that one of my students was going wrong. Foreseeing theimpending tragic results, I brought out every possible reason that mightdissuade him from the course his life was taking; but I saw that no amount of mywill power helped him, because he had made up his mind to follow the way ofevil. “All right,” I told myself finally, “it is ‘good-bye’; let him go.” Butsoon my great love and concern for him came to the fore again. I sat under abanyan tree and began to visualize him. Fervently and repeatedly I broadcast tohim a mental message: “God has told me to command you to return.” By evening mybody and mind were athrill with the intuition that he was coming.2[part0013.html#footnote-043] At last, there he was at the gate; the “prodigalson” had come back to the fold. He pranamed3 [part0013.html#footnote-042] andsaid, “All day long, wherever I went and whatever I did, I beheld your image.What was it all about?”“God was calling you through me,” I replied. “It was His call, not mine. Therewas no selfish motive in my desire; but I had made up my mind I wouldn’t stirfrom this place until you came.” That kind of determination can change theworld. A marvelous power!So, deep prayer does work. The best time to pray is at night, when there arefewer distractions. If necessary, sleep a little in the evening so that you arewide awake when you have your prayers at night, and have it out with God. Atfirst it will seem hard, but as you keep on trying it will become easier. Youwill be surprised at the results. As soon as your will becomes powerful, Godbegins to answer. And when the Infinite condescends to break His vow of silence,you will not be able to contain your joy. But if you have an egotistic desire todemonstrate to others the power of your prayers, or if you commercialize it, youwill lose that power. God will respond to you no more; you will have frightenedHim away. He comes only when you are sincere and when you love Him for His ownsake. When you are impressed with yourself and want to show off, He sees thatyou seek, not Him, but fame and glorification of your ego, and He will not come.Who Will Persist Until God Answers?God is not a mute unfeeling Being. He is love itself. If you know how tomeditate to make contact with Him, He will respond to your loving demands. Youdo not have to plead; you can demand as His child. But which of you will spendthe necessary time? Which of you will persist until you become so concentratedthat you receive an answer from Him?Suppose you have a mortgage on your home and you cannot meet it. Or there is acertain job you want. In the silence that comes after meditating deeply,concentrate with unswerving will on the thought of your need. Do not keeplooking for the result. If you sow a seed in the ground and then take it outevery once in a while to see if it is growing, it will never sprout. Similarly,if every time you pray you look for a sign that the Lord is granting your wish,nothing will happen. Never try to test God. Just go on praying unceasingly. Yourduty is to bring your need to God’s attention, and to do your part in helpingGod to bring that desire to fruition. For example, in chronic diseases, do yourbest to help promote healing, but know in your mind that ultimately God alonecan help. Take that thought with you into meditation every night, and with allyour determination pray; suddenly one day you will find the disease gone.First, the mind receives the suggestion. Then the Divine impregnates the mindwith His power. Finally the brain releases the life energy to heal. You do notrealize the power of God that is in your mind. It controls all the bodilyfunctions. You can promote any condition in the body if you exercise that powerof your mind. It is necessary first to learn the right method of meditation;then you can apply its divinely empowered concentration to heal the body, or tohelp you in any other difficulty.Every day undertake something that is difficult for you, and try to do it.Though you fail five times, keep on, and as soon as you have succeeded in thatdirection, apply your concentrated will on something else. You will thus be ableto accomplish increasingly greater things. Will is the instrument of the imageof God within you. In will lies His limitless power, the power that controls allthe forces of nature. As you are made in His image, that power is yours to bringabout whatever you desire: You can create prosperity; you can change hatred intolove. Pray until body and mind are completely subjugated; then you will receiveGod’s response. I constantly find that my slightest wish is answered.Your Greatest Necessity Is GodBetween the eyebrows is the door to heaven. This center4[part0013.html#footnote-041] in the brain is the seat of will. When youconcentrate deeply there and calmly will, whatever you are willing shall comeabout. So never use your will for evil purposes. To will harm to someoneintentionally is a grave misuse of your God-given power. If you find your willgoing in the wrong direction, stop! Not only is it a waste of your divineenergy, it will be the cause of your losing that power; you will not be able toemploy it even for good purposes.Determine honestly whether or not your prayer is legitimate. Do not ask God forthings that are quite impossible in the natural order of life. Ask only for truenecessities. And know the difference between “necessary necessities” and“unnecessary necessities.” The best way to cure yourself of desires for“unnecessary necessities” is to reason them away. Dreaming of big buildings usedto be a hobby of mine, but that interest is gone now. I have plenty of them, andall the headaches that accompany their maintenance! Ownership is a worrisomeresponsibility. Cut out desires for needless possessions. Concentrate only onyour real needs.Your greatest necessity is God. He will give you not only your “necessarynecessities,” but your “unnecessary necessities” as well. He will satisfy yourevery desire when you are one with Him. Your wildest dreams will come true.When I was a little boy in India I so much wanted a pony, but my mother wouldn’tallow me to have one. Some years later, after I had started my school for boysin Ranchi, I brought home a horse for our use. One morning I found she had givenbirth to a colt. Just what I had wanted in my childhood! Many such experienceshave come to me. Long ago, while I was traveling in Kashmir, I saw thisbuilding5 [part0013.html#footnote-040] in a vision. Years later, when I came toLos Angeles and saw this place, I recognized it as the building in my vision,and knew that God intended it to be ours.Follow the Rules of PrayerThe first rule in prayer is to approach God only with legitimate desires. Thesecond is to pray for their fulfillment, not as a beggar, but as a son: “I amThy child. Thou art my Father. Thou and I are One.” When you pray deeply andcontinuously you will feel a great joy welling up in your heart. Don’t besatisfied until that joy manifests; for when you feel that all-satisfying joy inyour heart, you will know that God has tuned in your prayer broadcast. Then prayto your Father: “Lord, this is my need. I am willing to work for it; pleaseguide me and help me to have the right thoughts and to do the right things tobring about success. I will use my reason, and work with determination, butguide Thou my reason, will, and activity to the right thing that I should do.”This is how I have always prayed. Now, as soon as I ask God about someundertaking, I know whether I should do it or not, and I know what steps Ishould and should not take.Be practical and earnest about prayer. Concentrate deeply on what you arepraying. Before you seek a job, or sign a contract, or do anything important,think of that Power. Think of it continuously. Take time out of sleep. Your mindis habituated to resting at night from the day’s duties, and keeps urging,“Sleep.” You must answer with all your divine power of will: “Away with sleep!My engagement with God is more important.” Then you will receive God’s response.[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0013.html#footnote-044-backlink] Matthew 26:39.2 [part0013.html#footnote-043-backlink] Great masters enjoy a divine awarenessthat permeates the entire body. For example, their intuitive perception of thewrong thoughts of a disciple may be felt physically, like sharp pinpricks.Similarly, harmonious, happy intuitions are sometimes accompanied by a pleasanttingling sensation.

Talking of Him and listening to His words in thescriptures, thinking of Him, feeling His presence in meditation, you will seethat gradually the Unreal becomes real, and this world which you think is realwill be seen as unreal. There is no joy like that realization.The joy of God is boundless, unceasing, all the time new. Body, mind, nothingcan disturb you when you are in that consciousness—such is the grace and gloryof the Lord. And He will explain to you whatever you haven’t been able tounderstand; everything you want to know.There is no use trying to know too much now. How many incarnations would youhave to spend to learn all that is written in the book of nature? Millions oflives would not be sufficient. So why bother? All things you will find andunderstand in God. The masters of India have always said, “First know Him.”Then, whatever you desire to know, He will reveal to you. This is His kingdom;this is His knowledge.As life goes on, its illusions fall away; you see what it is all about. And whenthe illusions of childhood and youth are gone, what is there left? Only in thedivine consciousness behind this door [Paramahansaji here touched his foreheadto indicate the location of the Christ center, seat of the spiritual eye2[part0014.html#footnote-053]] can we find pure happiness. I cut the world out ofmy life because of its delusive influence, which makes unimportant things seemimportant. We are all living in a land of make-believe, trying to “keep up withthe Joneses”; yet it is only by remaining in the consciousness of Spirit that wecan be happy. Try it!God is eager to bring you to His kingdom, for He craves something too: that youspontaneously seek Him and cling to Him. Otherwise, He would not have createdthe universe and man. His perfection is not conditioned by this craving; but theone reason behind His creating us is His desire that we love Him and return toHim. He is looking forward to that time. In our love is His fulfillment.The Father has given us freedom to jump into the fire of world illusion or toreturn to His home. It is a question of what you would like. Let us all go Home,that we need not come back into this terrible world. We do not know under whatconditions we will incarnate again. Certainly we do not want to be reborn intimes of suffering and depressions such as we are having now. These troubles arethe result of man’s selfishness and hate. The whole earth is groaning becauseGod has been forgotten.Resolve now to go home to your Father. You are fearfully wasting your time, andyou can’t afford to. You don’t know how fortunate you are to have been born as ahuman being. In that you are blessed more than any other creature. The animal isnot able to meditate and have God-communion. You have your freedom to seek Himand you don’t use it. You sit a little while in meditation and your mind wandersaway. But when the mind prays and prays, and prays again, heaven opens. Then youwill be given all the convincing experiences by which you shall know that Godis.God Is Waiting for Your InvitationI speak not from book learning, but from perceptions of God. I could not speakof Him this way if I didn’t see or feel Him; He wouldn’t let me. As I speak toyou I see before me whatever I am talking about; many times I don’t even seeyou. I wouldn’t tell you anything at all if I didn’t know Him. But I am here totell you that the very joy you are seeking in sex, money, wine, love, fame—thatjoy is within yourself. You don’t have to go elsewhere. You don’t have to beg orflatter God; but you have to ask. You have to pray to Him sincerely andlovingly, “Come to me.”You are not determined enough. As the miser loves money, as the lover loves thebeloved, so should you love God; then you will find Him, without fail. It isdifficult, but if at night you sit long in meditation you won’t know time. Evenwhen I don’t get any sleep, I never miss it. When God comes, where is sleep?where is the body? Nothing matters but His intoxicating presence. You read innovels of ideal love, but it is nothing compared to the love of God. Hasten toHim. To be ever conscious of Him is the most wonderful existence. As I amtalking to you, again and again the whole world melts away and I feel only HisBliss.Creation Is Meant to Disillusion YouScience devises methods for your physical comfort, stimulating and catering toendless desires. But after a while creature comforts become burdens, pleasuresno longer, because you find it is hard work to take care of them. Thus you “pay”for everything you get except divine blessedness. For that you have only to sitstill and ask your Heavenly Father. If I thought I had to earn God I wouldn’ttry; as a son I have a right to know Him. If you ask your right from the Father,He will give it to you. To those devotees who urge, He comes. That is what Hewants. His whole creation is intended to disillusion you, and thus cause you todraw back to Him. You don’t know when you will be taken away from this earth;there is no law that you will enjoy a long life. This proves how foolish it isto waste time. I live from minute to minute, day to day. I know only the joy ofliving; inside, complete resignation to Him.A time will come when everything will be made or accomplished by will. Whateveryou wish you will see done. This I have demonstrated again and again in my life.Development of the heavenly power of will for its divinely intended use—to knowGod—is the only purpose in human life. He has created each one of you, and He isthrobbing in you, crying to enter your consciousness so that He may release you.I am sure He feels guilty for having created us! Every day I ask Him why He didit. (I talk to Him about anything that comes to my mind. He likes it, that I am“after” Him; He knows His creation is anything but perfect.) The Lord repliesthat you cannot make steel until you have made the iron white-hot in fire. It isnot meant for harm. Trouble and disease have a lesson for us. Our painfulexperiences are not meant to destroy us, but to burn out our dross, to hurry usback Home. No one is more anxious for our release than God.It is His voice that is speaking through me. If only one person responds andfinds his freedom in Spirit, my task is done. The salvation of one life is worthmore than the conversion of thousands. I tell you of one Master of thisuniverse—one Beloved who is waiting for you, crying for you. You don’t know howHe rejoices when a soul enters His kingdom! He gathers all the angels togetherand they celebrate that soul’s entrance into heaven. What joy there is!For good reason you are not allowed to remember your past incarnations. Supposeyou have been born ten times. You have therefore had ten mothers. How can youlove them all the same? You are meant to learn that behind those ten mothersthere is One Mother; behind all friends, One Friend; behind all fathers, OneFather; behind all loves, One Love. How wonderful is that recognition! It is asif you had been playing hide-and-seek in the corridors of incarnations, and thenyou find Him! When I realized that One Love, I could not contain myself. My mindvanished into the Infinite Kingdom. It is so, even now. The joy of Spirit isendless.Seek a Definite Understanding of TruthIn the physical sciences everything is systematized into definite conceptions:combine two particular substances, or two substances in a particular way, for acertain result. The great masters of Self-Realization Fellowship are telling youwhy you should seek God scientifically, and the scientific way to get to Him.Every effort you make to follow these instructions will bring to you a definiteunderstanding. Some read a little about the spiritual laws, and then put thebook aside. That is not the way to Self-knowledge. You must make these truths apractical part of your life.Most people don’t take religion seriously. They keep it in the realm ofimagination and fancy. In India we are taught the practical use of religion. Wedon’t say, “Well, I shall find out all about God in the hereafter.” We want toknow God now.Science and religion should go hand in hand. All the results of scientificinvestigation are definite and are connected by reason, whereas religion isoften dogmatic. When Jesus urged his disciples to have faith, he didn’t meanblind belief. It breaks my heart when I see blind dogmatism, for it is onereason why the majority of people have no real interest in God. Although thereare nevertheless many who are interested in God, real seekers are few, becausehardly anyone tries to understand his way out of this dream drama. Few of Hischildren appreciate the gifts of the Heavenly Father, and of those who do, fewerstill try deeply or scientifically enough to know Him. Those who want to seekHim earnestly should learn how to do so scientifically.By Yoga, Religion Can Be Made ScientificYoga is definite and scientific. Yoga means union of soul and God, throughstep-by-step methods with specific and known results. It raises the practice ofreligion above the differences of dogma. My guru, Sri Yukteswar, extolled Yoga;he did not, however, indicate that realization of God thereby would beimmediate. “You have to work hard for it,” he told me. I did, and when thepromised results came, I saw that Yoga was marvelous.3[part0014.html#footnote-052]Those who do not give time to their religion cannot expect to know all at onceabout God and the hereafter. Usually people don’t make the effort, or if theydo, the effort is not deep and sincere enough. Nighttime should be spent withGod. You sleep more than necessary, and thus waste many valuable hours. Nightwas meant to screen all the attractions of the world, that you might the moreintently explore the kingdom of God. He created darkness to obscure materialobjects, for He wants you to forget the world at night and seek Him. Read thescriptures, read the Lessons,4 [part0014.html#footnote-051] and meditate—theglory and the joy it brings! Nothing else can give you that experience. See ifit isn’t true.Remember, if you don’t find God, you are not making enough effort in yourmeditation. Should you not find the pearl after one or two divings, don’t blamethe ocean. Blame your diving; you are not going deep enough. If you dive reallydeep you will find the pearl of His presence. Unless we apply definite methodsof science in practicing religion, it becomes little more than a salve for ourconscience. “Oh yes, I go to church every Sunday,” people say; but they don’tknow why they go. And once they have said “Amen” after the sermon, they forgetall about church until the next Sunday. Isn’t that foolish? If you do notcommune with God there, why should you go?The saints say that if you coax God earnestly enough, you can see Him. But youhave to do it all yourself. It is good to meditate with a few others, but makethe supreme effort alone at night, not just in church on Sundays. Get away fromeveryone. It is good for your health, your nerves, and your longevity not to mixtoo much with people. Most of them are thinking only of what you can give them.Hardly anyone thinks of your highest welfare except your spiritual teacher andGod. The wise teacher will give you but one instruction: think of God.And share Him; there is no form of service greater than to speak of God. If youconvince someone that the path of error leads to the valley of death, and thatthe path of meditation leads to everlasting life, you have given him somethingof more value than a million dollars. Money is perishable, but realization ofGod will go with us beyond the portals of the grave. Therefore whenever I seeanyone striving and struggling with great intensity to know God, it gives megreat joy.Although I am planning and doing things in the world, it is only to please theLord. I test myself: even when I am working I whisper within, “Where are You,Lord?” and the whole world changes. There is nothing but a great Light, and I ama little bubble in that Ocean of Light. Such is the joy of existence in God.The experiences I have told you about are scientifically attainable. If youfollow the spiritual laws, the result is certain. If the result doesn’t come,find fault with your effort. Intensity in all your religious practices is theonly way. Those who don’t meditate regularly and deeply are restless wheneverthey do meditate, and give up after a short effort. But if you make a greatereffort day by day, the ability to go deep will come. I don’t have to make anyeffort now; the whole world is gone instantly when I close my eyes and gaze intothe Christ center. And I used to sit for hours trying to forget the body and thethoughts! I came to a point where I thought it was no use. But I saw it was myfault. Between the restless thoughts and God there is a wall; the ordinaryperson doesn’t try, so he never gets over that wall. But the spiritual fightergoes on. When the mind becomes still, you are in the kingdom of the Infinite.Those who have spent too much time on foolish things remain fruitlessly knockingoutside.Communion with God is the only thing to live for. You will have to come to thatunderstanding eventually, often after much suffering. Why not learn now? He isready to welcome you. You can’t fail to reach God ultimately. It is foolish toask, “Will I be able to get into the kingdom of heaven?” There is no other placeyou can stay, for that is your real home. You don’t have to earn it. You arealready God’s child, made in His image. You have only to tear away the mask ofthe human being and realize your divine birthright.Satan Makes Us Think God Is UnattainableSo never say that you won’t be able to get into the kingdom of heaven. Satandrops that delusive thought in your mind to keep you here. You are not a mortalbeing. When I heard that from my Guru I was overjoyed. Thereafter I refused toconsider myself a sinner. Nor should you call yourself a sinner; it is adesecration of the image of God within you. Nor should you let anyone else callyou a sinner. What does it matter, what you were yesterday? You are a child ofGod, now and evermore. Who can keep you away from the kingdom of God? That ishow you should feel. But you must scientifically pursue Him. The science ofreligion is to make the effort in meditation until God becomes real to you,until you know that He alone is real. I used to go to the crematory grounds andpray to see through the delusion of the world; I cried in the woods, I closetedmyself in the attic, praying unceasingly until that realization came. I beheldburning worlds steaming and fuming around the feet of my Divine Mother.5[part0014.html#footnote-050] In the light of Her wisdom all my mortality wasconsumed.Meditation Is the True Practice of ReligionThe true practice of religion is to sit still in meditation and talk to God. Butyou don’t get to that point of intensity, you don’t concentrate enough, and thatis why you remain in delusion. To teach the value of long, intense concentrationon God, I instituted an all-day Christmas meditation just before Christmas eachyear.6 [part0014.html#footnote-049] At first the devotees feel only how long itis, but as they go deep they become oblivious of time. Most churchgoers can’tsit still for an hour unless there is something going on all the while to diverttheir minds.To be in the consciousness of God is entirely different; it comes when you sitquietly and say: “One by one I close the doors of the senses, lest the aroma ofthe rose or the song of the nightingale distract my love from Thee.”7[part0014.html#footnote-048] And as you go on saying that with deeper and deeperconcentration and devotion, you will see after a little while that you haveforgotten all distractions; before your inward gaze a light appears, or saintsappear, or you are engulfed in a deep peace or divine joy.Any spiritual activity does good by keeping the thought of God alive, but whatis ultimately necessary is this intensity of effort to know Him. There should becenters of meditation all over the world, where devotees come together tocommune with God. When I come to the temple it is for one purpose: to be withGod and to tell you of God. And you come here for my words and to try bymeditation to feel His presence.One moon dispels the darkness of the heavens. So is one soul who is trained toknow God, a soul in whom there is true devotion and sincere seeking andintensity; and wherever he will go he will dispel the spiritual darkness ofothers. Those who are even thinking of God shine a little, but they are not ableto give light to the world. Ordinary religious people are like stars, givingonly a tiny light.Meditation Provides the Proof of God’s ExistenceBy scientific meditation become a true devotee, that like the moon you dispelthe darkness around yourself and others. Without realization through meditation,religion is the most mysterious book of all; you will never be able tounderstand it. But by meditation you have the proof of God’s existence.Go to your room and shut the door—make no fuss. Sit down and talk to God.Practice meditation. Let your mind become so intense that the next time you sitto meditate you won’t have to make the effort; your mind will be fixedimmediately on Him. If you don’t make a great effort to conquer physical andmental restlessness in the beginning, you will have difficulty every time youmeditate throughout the years. But if you make that supreme effort at the start,you will soon be happy and free.When I utter the name “God” my whole being melts away in His Joy. But that I hadto work for. Make the effort. I was not at first the devotional kind. My mindused to be very restless. But now it is just like fire. As soon as I put my mindat the Christ center, all thoughts are gone—breath, heart, and mind areinstantly still and I am aware only of Spirit.Make religion real by scientific methods. Science gives you definiteness andcertainty. Sit quietly and practice the methods that have been given by greatyogis of India: Mahavatar Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, Swami Sri Yukteswar.8[part0014.html#footnote-047] Find in yourself that supreme blessedness of whichI speak to you, and when you do you will see that religion is no longer a mythbut a scientific certainty. Pray to Him, “Lord, You are the Master of creation,so I come to You. I will never give up until You talk to me and make me realizeYour presence. I will not live without You.”Intensity, Secrecy, Devotion, and Constancy Are NecessaryThe great Indian saint Sri Ramakrishna was worshiping a stone image of Kali, theCosmic Mother, and praying for Her to appear to him in reality. His spiritualanguish became so intense that he felt life was no longer worth living. At thismoment his eyes fell on a sword that was kept in the temple, and like a madmanhe seized it, with the intention of ending his life. In that moment the Motherrevealed Herself in Her cosmic form. Her devotee was engulfed in an oceanicBliss. In the very place where the saint had this experience, that same stonestatue of the Divine Mother assumed a living form and spoke to me.9[part0014.html#footnote-046]If I hadn’t spent hours seeking God in meditation I would not have known thatreligion is a science. Intensity, secrecy, devotion, and constancy arenecessary. You don’t know when death will come. Every minute keep your mind onGod. Everything you want and need is right within you; seek long and seekdeeply. I meditate for hours; I see no one until I am finished. You must make upyour mind that you are not going to be bothered by anyone or anything. Then youwon’t know time.In my Yogoda school in Ranchi,10 [part0014.html#footnote-045] India, I used tospend all my spare time roaming around the grounds, here and there sittingawhile to meditate, until my mind was drunk with God. That is the only way tofind Him. Don’t waste your time. When you are able to live in the divineconsciousness, four to six hours of sleep are plenty; you will never feel tired,you will never miss sleep. Sleep is under my control; it is the same witheating. I have something infinitely greater, and God has proven that when He iswith me all the “necessities of life” become unnecessary. In that consciousnessyou become more healthy than the average person, more joyous, more bountiful inevery way. Don’t seek little things; they will divert you from God. Start yourexperiment now: make life simple and be a king.[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0014.html#footnote-054-backlink] The first temple on the grounds of theSelf-Realization Fellowship Hermitage in Encinitas was built in 1938 on a bluffoverlooking the Pacific Ocean.

Theancient Hindu sages discovered the existence of prana and formulated the scienceof pranayama,2 [part0015.html#footnote-061] life-energy control.Lord Jesus fasted in the wilderness for forty days. He said: “Man shall not liveby bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.”3[part0015.html#footnote-060]The “word” is cosmic vibration; the “mouth of God” is the medulla oblongata inthe posterior part of the brain, tapering off into the spinal cord. This, themost vital spot in the human body, is the divine entrance (“mouth of God”) forthe “word” or Aum,4 [part0015.html#footnote-059] the cosmic vibratory energy bywhich man is sustained.People who never fast do not know from experience that man can live, as Christdid for forty days, solely by the “word” of God.In the early stages of a week’s fasting, hunger is present; but as the days goby, less hunger and a sense of freedom are distinctly felt. Why? Because denialof gross food to the body compels it to depend on immaterial food: the lifecurrent.Man’s will power is the great generator of energy. Through will power andwillingness one is able to draw quickly on the infinite store of inner strength.A person who is unwilling to perform his daily tasks experiences a lack ofenergy. A man who works hard but with willingness is borne up physically andmentally by the cosmic current.One who learns and practices the metaphysical methods of living by will powerand by consciously tapping the inexhaustible source of life energy is freed frommany limitations of the body.The Hindu sages and yogis say that matter is materialized mind-stuff; and someof them, like Jesus, have proved this truth by demonstrating the power tomaterialize and dematerialize their bodies and other physical objects.The Chemical Elements of Matter Are Electronic VibrationsModern science shows that matter is composed of vibratory forces. The chemicalelements, the structural factors responsible for all forms in the universe—fromstones and stars to man—are nothing more than different forms of electronicvibrations. For example, in ice we find coldness, weight, form; it is visible.Melt the ice; it becomes water. Pass electricity through it; it becomesinvisible hydrogen and oxygen, which, analyzed further, are forms of electronicvibrations. One may therefore say scientifically that ice does not exist, eventhough it is perceptible to our senses of sight, touch, and so on. In realityits essence is invisible electrons or forms of energy.In other words, that which can be dissolved into invisibility cannot be said tohave a valid existence. In this sense, matter can be considered as not existing;but matter does have relative existence. Matter exists in relation to our mindand as an expression of invisible electronic forces that do exist, beingunchangeable and immortal.Both water and ice are manifestations of invisible gases and have only formal,transitory existence. Similarly, both mortal mind and matter are fleetingmanifestations of Divine Consciousness, and possess merely formal existence; inreality only Cosmic Mind exists.Just as a child is born through the instrumentality of parents, so matter isdependent on mind for its existence. Matter is born from Divine Mind and isperceptible to mortal mind; in itself and of itself, matter has no reality, nointrinsic existence.The blind or nonintellectual electronic forces of creation are neverthelesscreative teleological agents because they contain within themselves thevibrations of the universal, conscious-of-itself life force or prana, which inturn issued from the fiat of Divinity.“God said, Let there be light: and there was light,”5[part0015.html#footnote-058] that is, the projection of Divine Thought and Willbecame light or vibratory energy, the flowing forth of life current andelectrons, which further vibrated more strongly and became the diverse subtle orunseen forces of nature, which in turn externalized themselves as the ninety-twoprincipal elements of matter that constitute the universe.To human consciousness, matter is both perceptible and real. But man haddiscovered through theoretical investigation, through logic, and through certainlaboratory experiments (such as converting a visible piece of ice into invisibleforces) that a permanent and unalterable creative power must underlie all thetransitory and illusive forms of the phenomenal world.This truth may be grasped just as we grasp the fact that the ocean exists thoughits waves have no permanent existence, being just passing, formal manifestationsof one great substance. Waves cannot exist without the ocean, but the oceanexists with or without waves.These concepts can be intellectually understood but cannot be known until onehas learned the method of converting matter into life force, and life force intoCosmic Consciousness,6 [part0015.html#footnote-057] as Christ, Krishna, andother Self-realized masters were able to do. To such enlightened ones, matterper se does not exist, because they see that beneath the slight rippling wavesof creation is the changeless Ocean of Spirit.The Universe Is God’s DreamIn the Vedanta7 [part0015.html#footnote-056] and Yoga philosophies the universeis spoken of as God’s dream. Matter and mind—the cosmos with its stars andplanets; the gross surface waves and the subtle undercurrents of the materialcreation; the human powers of feeling, will, and consciousness; and the statesof life and death, day and night, health and disease, success and failure—arerealities according to the law of relativity governing this dream of God’s.All the dualities perceived by the law of relativity are real to the dreamer,the mortal man who plays his little part in the great cosmic dream. To escapefrom maya, illusion, the law of relativity, one must awaken from the dream intoeternal God-wakefulness. We cannot change the lawful dream by imagination or bydenying its existence, or by accepting “life” but rejecting “death,” or byrecognizing health but ignoring sickness. One state is as much a part of itsopposite state as are the two sides of a fabric. The dualities are inherentlyand essentially one. The truth seeker does not try to separate them in his mind,but to rise above them by wisdom.The man who considers his body to be different from his mind, and who wants toaccept as “real” only the positive, happy, and beneficial aspects of a universeunalterably dual in its nature, is a man deeply asleep in the delusions of thedream world.Just as a person has dreams that seem real for a time but lose their validitywhen he emerges into the waking state of consciousness, so it is possible forman to awaken from the dream of matter-reality and to live in the changelessrealm of Spirit.Only the superman, who has learned to expand and transfer his consciousness tothe Infinite, can realize creation as a dream of God’s; he alone can say withtrue knowledge that matter has no existence. By means of a long series ofself-disciplinary steps—through following the scientific yoga path or any otherway of spiritual perfection, whether that of love, wisdom, service, orself-effacement—the God-seeker dissolves the dualities and discerns the EternalOneness. “Whosoever, freed from delusion, knows Me thus as the Supreme Spirit,knows all. He worships Me with his whole being.”8 [part0015.html#footnote-055][../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0015.html#footnote-062-backlink] “Lifetrons,” the finer-than-atomicenergies that sustain life in all things in the universe. There are two kinds ofprana: cosmic energy, the omnipresent source of life and vitality permeating andsurrounding all living things; and the specific prana or energy pervading eachhuman body.2 [part0015.html#footnote-061-backlink] Through pranayama the adept is able tocontrol the life energy in the sensory and motor nerves, and thus free his mindfrom body consciousness during meditation. He is able also to use this lifeenergy to heal or vitalize his body at will.3 [part0015.html#footnote-060-backlink] Matthew 4:4.4 [part0015.html#footnote-059-backlink] Gross matter emanates from and issustained by the intelligent cosmic vibration of God, the subtle buildingmaterial of the universe.

Although some lives are without muchinterest and excitement, others are full of extraordinary experiences. I heardof a man who tried thirty-two times to commit suicide, and something happenedevery time to prevent him. Imagine what it would be like to know all about thelives of all the people who are now on earth, and those who are gone, and thosewho are yet to come! Such is God’s power. Jesus said, “Are not two sparrows soldfor a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without [theknowledge of] your Father.”1 [part0016.html#footnote-076] The lifetimes ofexperiences of all men are in God’s memory. It is difficult indeed to conceiveof a consciousness that is aware of everything that has ever happened. Yet tofathom the nature of Spirit is the greatest adventure in this universe. I willgive you a picture of it as it is coming to me at this moment before myspiritual eye.2 [part0016.html#footnote-075]Truths are more than imagination; they are real. Yet their origin is a thoughtin the mind of God. All of the different forms of atomic matter, for example,are but materialized thoughts of God—they can be reconverted into thoughts, andthe thoughts can again be materialized into objects. Man also has the power toconceive ideas, but his imagination is not very strong. If his imaginationbecame powerful enough, man could create material objects on earth.3[part0016.html#footnote-074] He has latent within him the same creative power bywhich God, even as He thought, materialized His mental creations in the world.But it has become next to impossible for man to materialize his thoughts becausehe has not utilized the free power, the divine power of thought, bestowed on himby God.When we try to imagine the consciousness of God we wonder how He can rememberall things, because we judge everything by the standard of our own mentalcapacity. We understand according to our own experience. A person whose memoryis not strong tends to assume that everyone else’s memory is the same way. Yetthere are persons of exceptional memory who can recall a whole book, perhaps,just as easily as you can remember a few lines. Those who are forgetful find itdifficult to realize that others can have an unfailing power of recollection.A jeweler remembers his jewels, a bookkeeper the figures in his books; so God isable to remember everything that He has created in this universe. Being giftedwith almighty power, He has instant recall of everything that has ever happened.God does not need a limited physical brain to remember what has passed. Hislimitless consciousness is all-knowing.The Origin and Power of MemoryMemory is a wondrous power. All human memory comes from God’s tremendous memory.For example, you cannot tell me about all the motion pictures you have seensince birth, but if I were to show you one of those films again, you wouldinstantly recall it. The divine underlying memory is right there within you,ever recognizing experiences that have passed. As soon as you see the openingscene again, the whole story comes back to you. “Oh, I saw this picture before,”you say. “I remember how it ended.”How is it that we can recognize a picture—every detail of it—that we have seenyears ago? Because all happenings are recorded in the brain. As soon as you putthe needle of attention on a certain record of experience, your memory begins toplay back that experience. If I ask where you were sitting when we were heretogether last Thursday, you recall it and begin to remember other things aswell. If I ask, “What did I say?” my words start coming back to you.The inner power of memory comes from God and is perfect. It never forgets. Theordinary man’s memory cannot hold the consciousness of all experiences at onetime, but the underlying divine memory retains everything simultaneously andpermanently. Therefore good or poor memory is a matter of conviction. You haveconvinced yourself that you have a weak memory and so you have a weak memory.However, it is not easy to jump from this belief to the opposite. Much effort isrequired to convince yourself that your memory is in actuality a manifestationof the all-recalling divine memory of God.The greatest human memory is naught but a borrowing from the unlimitedconsciousness of God, in which are recorded all the adventures of all humanbeings and other life-forms.Creation—Dual Adventure of God and ManThe story of God’s creation is marvelous—how He projected into existence allbeings on this earth, and how He is working behind the scenes to bring us backto our real existence in Him. It is almost impossible to describe in humanlanguage the cosmic adventure of God’s creation and its subtle intertwining withthe individual life-adventures of countless human beings.We find that human beings live on the average sixty years, the crocodile fromsixty to a hundred. The redwood tree lives for two thousand years, the dog onlyabout fourteen, and the horse at most about thirty-six years. It is evident thatSomeone has fixed these various life-spans. Yet we hear of some great yogis whohave lived for hundreds of years.4 [part0016.html#footnote-073] I knowdefinitely that Mahavatar Babaji5 [part0016.html#footnote-072] has lived forcenturies and is still in his body in perfect youth. Trailanga Swami6[part0016.html#footnote-071] is said to have lived for more than three hundredyears. Truth is more fascinating than fiction.It is possible to imagine that under favorable conditions (and if there is nowaste of vital essence,7 [part0016.html#footnote-070] and there is proper foodand right thinking) the human body could go on indefinitely. But the pressureson the body are terrific. When a mouse is caught in a trap, its heart beats manytimes faster than it does normally, and when you are unable to pay your bills,your heart does the same! Thus worry takes its toll. And there are other kindsof stress. I am told that the Police Commissioner of Chicago has demonstratedwith instruments the possibility that if noise were taken away from the cities,their residents would live ten years longer.We are living in a wonderful world nevertheless. Those who exist only to “eat,drink, and be merry,” and to sleep, have no idea of the wonders of human life.The adventure begins with the struggle the soul goes through to enter a womb atthe time of conception. In the astral world8 [part0016.html#footnote-069] thereare millions of souls struggling to return to earth, to enter the mated spermand ovum cells at the time of conception. Saint or sinner, unless you haveattained final redemption there is a great desire to reincarnate again on earth.At the time of conception there is a flash in the ether and one soul enters asthe sperm and ovum cells unite. You had to fight to get into the womb. Not onlyyou but many souls rushed to enter, and the ones that won are you, and you, andI. It was not an easy victory.Prenatal ConsciousnessAfter you have entered the womb you ask, “What have I done? I have been freefrom the confining mortal body for so long, gliding along in a weightless bodyof light, and now I am caught again in a physical form.” Nevertheless, youbecome accustomed to these new conditions during the nine months in the womb.That is the punishment. It is nine months of living in a dungeon in which youhave to breathe through someone else, eat through someone else, receive yourblood, and the power for its circulation, through someone else. You aredependent. Your soul cries to the Lord, “Let me out of this prison! I can’t see,I can’t hear, I am bound.”If there is a hades or purgatory it is those nine months in the mother’sbody—helpless, in darkness, bound to one spot like a tree, with only occasionalmemories of the past coming in, and then lapses into sleep. It is when memoriesof the past life come that you struggle in the mother’s body. I have transportedmy consciousness into these prenatal states and I know what I am saying.9[part0016.html#footnote-068] The baby’s sleep and wakefulness in the mother’sbody do not depend on her sleeping and waking. The child’s will to move is amemory coming from the soul’s past. So he stirs restlessly in the mother’s bodyuntil he tires and goes to sleep. Then he wakes up for a while and moves again.He feels hunger, and, through the nourishment in the mother’s blood, thesatisfaction of his hunger.The infant slightly hears the vibrations of the mother’s heartbeat andcirculation; by these sounds he is made conscious of his body and he wants to befree. Thus the soul’s first adventure is the fight between two ideas: the wishto return to earth in a human form, and the desire to feel the freedom of havingno form.The soul’s human encasement starts out as a fishlike form with a tiny tail. Thatform grows into an animal form, curled up in the womb. There comes an occasionalmemory of the past life, and the embryo stirs. The struggle becomes greater asthe embryo begins to grow into a human form in the mother’s body. The soulcries, “Let me out!” When the will becomes very strong, the baby is born.Premature babies are souls who are very stubborn-willed. They don’t want toremain nine months in the mother’s body, and so they come early.The Breath of LifeThe infant arrives in this world crying; because, the saints say, the soulremembers its previous incarnations and does not like the thought of coming backto earth again to go through the struggle of life here. Related also to thismemory is the attitude of supplication in which a baby usually holds its handsbefore it comes into the world. It is praying to God, “Please don’t give mephysical birth again.”The physiological explanation of the baby’s crying is that the lungs must beopened up in order to start the breathing process, and the baby’s first cry isan effort to activate the lungs and start the breath of life. When the baby isborn, the breath goes in, and the soul that was semi-dormant becomes a livingbeing with an independent life. “God breathed into his nostrils the breath oflife; and man became a living soul.”10 [part0016.html#footnote-067] Many personsmistakenly believe that the soul enters the body at birth, but if the soul werenot already there, the body would not have developed from the original tinycells. Should the soul leave the embryo before birth, the infant will be borndead.Man’s body is made of sixteen basic material elements supported and activated bynineteen elements11 [part0016.html#footnote-066] of subtle energy. These can becondensed into pure consciousness. “Man became a living soul” refers to the factthat the ordinary man’s physical body, which is made of chemicals (“the dust ofthe ground”), must breathe oxygen in order to be sustained on earth, as ordainedby God when He first “breathed into his nostrils the breath of life.”When the baby is born, he blinks at the light, he hears sounds, he smells andtastes, and he breathes. He sees that conditions seem to be normal—he has aphysical body again. His prenatal resistance to birth ends with his firstbreath, when maya (the cosmic delusion that “existence” depends on body andbreath) comes over him. He feels once more attracted to the physical world.As time goes on the baby struggles for control over his body. How often you seehim repeatedly thrusting his hands and feet up in the air in an attempt atcoordination! All these actions are directed by the subconscious mind throughthe soul’s memory of the past. That memory is always there. You instinctivelyfear death because you remember the many times you have been through thatexperience. You are also afraid of pain because you have suffered many timesbefore.When the baby grows into a little child he is surrounded by the influences ofthe mother’s and father’s guiding will, and the wills of other relatives aswell. Each one wants him to be something different, and his naughty friends wanthim to be still something else!The child has a great many struggles with these conflicting pressures. This is amiserable life, so it is good to give your children a little freedom. Young oneswho are given too much freedom, however, may later lament, “I wish I had beentold long ago not to do this; then I would not be what I am today.” Think of allthe struggles, physiological and mental, one has to go through until he becomesa youth. At that time of life the senses become more active and the youth has agreat inner battle with himself. The struggle with the senses is a tremendouscontest. To conquer in this adventure of youth, to go victoriously through thisthrill of living, is a great experience.Man Should Befriend HimselfIt is wonderful to be alive, but there are many agents waiting to kill us. Anadventure with wild animals in South Africa is nothing compared to the adventureof life itself. No other tale in history is as interesting. Man with hisintelligence knows how to protect himself against animals, but he doesn’t knowhow to protect himself against his own bad habits and evil ways. The greatest ofall enemies of man is himself. More than personal or national enemies, more thangerms, bombs, or any other threat, man should fear himself when he is wrong. Toremain in ignorance of your divine nature and to be overpowered by bad habits isto make an enemy of your own self. The best way to be successful in thisadventure of life is to be your own friend. Krishna said: “The Self is thefriend of the (transformed) self, but the enemy of the unregenerate self.”12[part0016.html#footnote-065]The Subtle EnemiesIt is easy to picture ourselves starting off to explore some wild and unknowncountry. If we are going by ship we want a lifeboat with us; should the steamersink, we know we can get into the boat and save ourselves. But in so many oflife’s experiences there seems to be a leak in our lifeboat, no matter whatprecautions we have taken.In a jungle infested with animals you can take reasonable care against them, butsubtle dangers are more difficult to overcome. How to protect oneself against abarrage of germs? Millions are floating around us all the time. We think we aresafe when we take precautions against dangers we can see and hear, but we haveonly inadequate means to protect ourselves against germs. In your ownbloodstream the white corpuscles are constantly fighting these organisms. Drugsonly numb them; the white corpuscles are the soldiers who move in and destroythem. If your blood is weak, the soldiers will not be able to help you. In thelungs of many unsuspecting persons lurk fierce tuberculosis bacilli, ready todestroy their host. Nature forms a restraining wall of cells around them, but itis effective only so long as the body can keep up its resistance. This struggleof life goes on constantly in the unseen jungle of life within! If you couldexamine your food under a microscope you would not eat it. Germs are having afeast thereon, and you are swallowing them whole. The water you drink is alivewith such organisms. There is no true vegetarian because everyone eats millionsof germs each day. Shall man then stop eating?Prepare for Every Kind of BattleIn order to go safely through this jungle of life you must equip yourself withthe proper weapons. You have to be a well-trained soldier. The layman whodoesn’t know how to protect himself is soon killed. The wise man who is armedagainst all forms of warfare—against disease, against destiny and karma, againstall evil thoughts and habits—becomes the victor in this adventure. It requirescarefulness and, in addition, the adoption of certain methods by which we canovercome our enemies.As we progress we learn better methods of vanquishing the causes of ourphysical, mental, moral, and spiritual disasters. When you have gonesuccessfully through physical illnesses and accidents and inner struggles, thenyou can say that life was a sweet adventure. Jesus could say this. But beforeyou have similarly conquered, it is premature to say that life is sweet. Untilyou have attained final ascension, liberation of the soul in God, life is notyet finished for you. You have not overcome the desire to be adventurous untilyou have ascended consciously in Spirit.Seeing someone who is suffering, you feel thankful that you are not goingthrough that particular adventure. But you may be next. The possibilities ofharm to the body are numerous. So be equipped. The scientist says, “Eatnourishing food and follow health laws to protect yourself from germs.” Thepolitician says, “Be good soldiers to protect yourselves from outside enemies.”We are living in strange times. Even women, the proverbial saviors of the world,are being trained as soldiers to kill others’ children. Horrible! But once in awhile some good comes from war—it removes cowardice from us.The Importance of Mind PowerIn this jungle of life, surrounded by enemies—disease, poverty, suffering, badhabits, and wrong desires—there are so many rules to be observed that lifebecomes intolerable when you try to keep them all in mind. You tire of thembecause each department of life is limitless in its potential for diversity.When you attempt to apply health rules you are nearly overwhelmed—there is notime to think about anything else! And everyone has a different set of healthprecepts for you to follow. We are under a great hypnosis. As I tried differentmethods, this truth dawned on me: mind controls the effectiveness of them all.God has given us one tremendous instrument of protection—more powerful thanmachine guns, electricity, poison gas, or any medicine—the mind. It is the mindthat must be strengthened. As for the body, I will do only the will of God. IfHe tells me to go to a doctor, it is all right, and if He tells me to suffer, itis all right. Whatever is His will is my will. An important part of theadventure of life is to get hold of the mind, and to keep that controlled mindconstantly attuned to the Lord. This is the secret of a happy, successfulexistence.The Ultimate Protection Is God-CommunionEven though you adopt physical methods of healing, do not put all your faith inthe methods, but in the power of God behind them. If you have cut your finger,put iodine on it, but inwardly pray: “Lord, help me not to be dependent onmedicine, but to rely on mind power alone.” You have not been taught how toattain that mental state. It comes by exercising mind power and by attuning themind to God through meditation. In this way you should gain complete power overthe mind before you try to deny matter and material remedies. Until then it isbest to take commonsense steps to help the body. When you can drink poison andremain unaffected by it, you can rightfully deny matter and say mind iseverything. You must arrive at that consciousness first.God offers you an invincible weapon by which you can eradicate all your sorrowsand suffering: wisdom, which comes through God-communion. The easiest way toovercome disease, disappointments, and disasters is to be in constant attunementwith God.We are babes in the woods of life, forced to learn by our own experiences andtroubles, stumbling into pitfalls of sickness and wrong habits. Again and againwe have to raise our voices for help. But the Supreme Help comes from tuning inwith Spirit.Whenever you are in trouble, pray: “Lord, You are within me and all around me. Iam in the castle of Thy presence. I have been struggling through life,surrounded by many kinds of deadly enemies. I now see that they are not reallyagents for my destruction; You have put me on earth to test my power. I am goingthrough these tests only to prove myself. I am game to fight the evils thatsurround me; I will vanquish them by the almightiness of Your presence. And whenI shall have passed through the adventure of this life I will say: ‘Lord, it washard to be brave and fight; but the greater my terror, the greater was thestrength within me, given by You, by which I conquered and realized that I ammade in Your image. You are the King of this universe and I am Your child, aprince of the universe. What have I to fear?’“As soon as you realize you have been born a human being you have everything tofear. There seems to be no escape. No matter what precautions you take, there isalways a misstep somewhere. Your only security is in God. Whether you are in theAfrican jungle or at war or racked by disease and poverty, just say to the Lord,and believe: “I am in the armored car of Your presence, moving across thebattlefield of life. I am protected.”There is no other way to be safe. Use common sense and trust fully in God. I amnot suggesting something eccentric; I am urging you to affirm and believe, nomatter what happens, in this truth: “Lord, it is You alone who can help me.”13[part0016.html#footnote-064] So many have fallen into ruts of disease and wronghabits and have not pulled themselves out. Never say you cannot escape. Yourmisfortune is only for a time. The failure of one life is not the measure ofwhether or not you are a success. The attitude of the conquering man isunafraid: “I am a child of God. I have nothing to fear.” So fear nothing. Lifeand death are only different processes of your consciousness.Everything the Lord has created is to try us, to bring out the buried soulimmortality within us. That is the adventure of life, the one purpose of life.And everyone’s adventure is different, unique. You should be prepared to dealwith all problems of health, mind, and soul by commonsense methods and faith inGod, knowing that in life or death your soul remains unconquered. You can neverdie. “No weapon can pierce the soul; no fire can burn it; no water can moistenit; nor can any wind wither it....The soul is immutable, all-permeating, evercalm, and immovable.”14 [part0016.html#footnote-063] You are eternally the imageof Spirit.Is it not freeing to the mind to know that death cannot kill us? When diseasecomes and the body stops working, the soul thinks, “I am dead!” But the Lordshakes the soul and says: “What is the matter with you? You are not dead. Areyou not still thinking?” A soldier is walking along and a bomb shatters hisbody. His soul cries, “Oh, I am killed, Lord!” And God says, “Of course not! Areyou not talking to Me? Nothing can destroy you, My child. You are dreaming.”Then the soul realizes: “This is not so terrible. It was only my temporaryearth-life consciousness of being a physical body that made losing it seem theend of me. I had forgotten that I am the eternal soul.”The Goal of Our Life-AdventureTrue yogis are able to control the mind under all circumstances. When thatperfection is reached, you are free. Then you know life is a divine adventure.Jesus and other great souls have proved this. Nothing could touch them. Theyenjoyed uninterruptedly the sweet romance with God. It is the only part of theadventure that has any purpose.Human love is meaningless unless anchored in the unconditional love of God. Aboy and a girl fall in love, and after a time they fall out of love. Romancewith human beings is imperfect. The romance with God is perfect and everlasting.You will finish this life-adventure only when you conquer its dangers by yourwill power and mind power, as did the Great Ones. Then you will look back andsay: “Lord, it was a pretty bad experience. I came near failing, but now I am inthe safety of Your presence forever.”We can see life as a wonderful adventure when the Lord finally says, “All thoseterrifying experiences are over. I am with you evermore. Nothing can harm you.”Man is playing at life like a child, but his mind grows stronger throughfighting sickness and troubles. Anything that weakens your mind is your greatestenemy, and whatever strengthens your mind is your haven. Laugh at any troublethat comes. The Lord has shown me that this life is but a dream. When you wakeup, you will remember it only as a dream of joy and sorrow that has passed. Youwill know you are everlasting in the Lord.[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0016.html#footnote-076-backlink] Matthew 10:29.2 [part0016.html#footnote-075-backlink] The telescopic gaze of intuition. Duringdeep meditation the single or spiritual eye becomes visible within the centralpart of the forehead.

He weighed three hundredpounds, although he rarely ate. Often he would meditate for days, seated on topof the Ganges waters; or remain sometimes hidden for long periods under itswaves. He was often seen at the Manikarnika Ghat, sitting motionless in the sunon the blistering stone slabs. His habitual disregard of nature’s laws was aconstant reminder to those who saw him that oneness with God is the highest law.7 [part0016.html#footnote-070-backlink] The vital essence, or sexual fluid,contains a high concentration of prana.

The initiative to undertake your most important duty inlife is often buried beneath the accumulated debris of human habits. You mustfree yourselves from their stultifying influence and start to sow the seeds ofthe success that you desire. Life is worthwhile when you are accomplishing themost essential work, which is to find out the meaning and true values of yourexistence.Man should be instructed by this cosmic motion picture of life. It is not beingshown without a reason. Each day we behold different scenes, and each day has alesson to teach. You are meant to learn the lesson by concentrating on thesupreme purpose of human existence: to know Who is behind your life.Without Self-Analysis, Man Leads Robotlike LifeMillions of people never analyze themselves. Mentally they are mechanicalproducts of the factory of their environment, preoccupied with breakfast, lunch,and dinner, working and sleeping, and going here and there to be entertained.They don’t know what or why they are seeking, nor why they never realizecomplete happiness and lasting satisfaction. By evading self-analysis, people goon being robots, conditioned by their environment. True self-analysis is thegreatest art of progress.Everyone should learn to analyze himself dispassionately. Write down yourthoughts and aspirations daily. Find out what you are—not what you imagine youare!—because you want to make yourself what you ought to be. Most people don’tchange because they don’t see their own faults.Everyone is the product of his heredity and environment. If you were born inAmerica you reflect certain American characteristics. If you were born in Chinaor England, you are likely to reflect the interests of those nationalities. Yourenvironment is the result of your true heredity—the traits and desires acquiredby you in past lives. This heredity of past incarnations has led to your beingborn in the particular family and environment in which you now find yourself.When we read about the families of important people, we often note that sons ofgreat men are not necessarily of the same mental caliber as their fathers. Thisfailure of biological heredity in man raises a great doubt in our minds: whydon’t we find the same results in human life that we observe in the plant andanimal kingdoms, where good pedigree usually produces good offspring? We mustprobe the inner life of man for an answer.Traits From Past Lives Influence Us NowIn a literary family it is not unusual to find a boy who doesn’t like literatureat all. He has been brought up with literature-loving companions, yet has noaffinity for it. Why? Environment or heredity in the ordinary sense does notexplain it. But beyond these factors is reincarnation. We are born into aparticular family because of certain characteristics that are similar. But everyperson in a family is an individual soul who brings his own distinctive traitsfrom his past lives. Hence there are always some biological hereditaryresemblances in families, yet each person is different in character.A man takes birth in a certain family, a particular social and nationalenvironment, owing to specific causes—his own past actions. Therefore man is thearchitect of his own destiny. One can almost predict what he will be in his nextlife by analyzing his dominant interests and habits in this one.Whatever You Have Done, You Can UndoSo self-analysis is important for the progress of the soul. Let us suppose thattragedies have been your favorite reading for many years, and that you naturallyfeel you will continue to enjoy them for the rest of your life. But if youanalyze yourself and see that you are becoming morose from constant reading ofthis type of literature, you will wish to form a new habit of perusing inspiringspiritual books. By doing so you will change the course of your life. We canalter ourselves very quickly with strong determination; but without it, one doesnot change effortlessly or in a minute the habit patterns of years. To eradicatea habit of long standing you must apply the full strength of your determinationin counteractivity until the bad habit is worn out. Most persons don’t have thenecessary patience. But everyone should feel encouraged by this truth: whateveryou have created or done you can undo.When you analyze what you are, have a firm desire to banish your weaknesses andto make yourself what you ought to be. Don’t allow yourself to be overwhelmedwith discouragement at the revelation of your shortcomings that honestself-analysis usually brings.Thought Produces Everything in the UniverseA theory has been advanced that thought is a product of the endocrine glands.Such a conception is unfounded. Flesh cannot produce thought. Mind is thearchitect of the microcosm and the macrocosm. As water by cooling andcondensation becomes ice, so thought by condensation assumes physical form.Everything in the universe is thought in material form. The endocrine organ isjust a physical structurization of a microcosmic thought-blueprint.The physical and mental aspects of man are closely interrelated; it is commonlyobserved that a person whose liver is out of order becomes cranky. When you arebilious, you don’t feel like smiling and saying “Peace” to everyone! You feelunamiable. Your thoughts and emotions are affected by your physical state.A weakening of the organs has a corresponding weakening effect on mental power.Those who eat a great deal of meat are often surly and full of vexation. If Iwere to put you on a grape juice diet for a week, it is likely you would feeluplifted and harmoniously disposed toward all.1[part0017_split_000.html#footnote-078]I recently met a man who was wearing just a lightweight suit and no overcoat,although it was terribly cold. He said he was seventy years old, and that henever feels cold. He didn’t even wear socks! He had accustomed his body tochilly weather. Mind influences body more than vice versa, but the bodilychemicals do exercise a constant influence on the mind.2[part0017_split_000.html#footnote-077] Body and mind are interdependent.Dreams Reveal the Omnipotence of MindFor example, suppose I am dreaming that I am awake and in the kitchen, and veryhungry. I eat something and drink a glass of milk. My hunger and thirst aregone, and I feel satisfied. What was the cause of my satisfaction? Was it thefood? Remember, I am dreaming. Is it not simply a change of thought that made mefeel satisfied? Since I am dreaming, it is my mind that thought it had takenfood. The hunger and the food and the milk were only ideas in my dream. All weremade of the same mind-stuff. When I wake up I realize that my experiences werenothing but a series of ideas. A mere change of thought removed the unpleasantsensation of hunger and substituted the pleasant sensation of eating food anddrinking milk. So you see, thought by itself can do anything.Once I was traveling by train when the weather was extremely hot; the air feltas if it were coming from a furnace. Everyone around me was suffering, but I wassmiling within because my mind was dissociated from the thought of the heat. Ihad said to myself: “Lord, the same electricity that makes heat in a furnacemakes ice in a refrigerator. Therefore why shouldn’t I be able to redirect thatelectricity of Yours to produce cold right now?” In that instant I felt as if asheet of ice had enveloped me.Change Your Mental AttitudeWe should bear in mind, however, that it is not wise to disregard the bodywholly. One should eat proper foods in preference to wrong foods. And if youmust live with people who make you nervous, then once in a while you shouldchange your surroundings. But it is better still if you can change your mentalenvironment, so that you won’t be disturbed by others’ actions. Change yourself,and you can then live anywhere in peace and happiness.Most of the world is like a mental hospital. Some people are sick with jealousy,others with anger, hatred, passion. They are victims of their habits andemotions. But you can make your home a place of peace. Analyze yourself. Allemotions are reflected in the body and mind. Envy and fear cause the face topale, and love makes it glow. Learn to be calm and you will always be happy.So remember, whatever type of ego you have, whatever personality you are tryingto express, you should make an effort to analyze your true nature and to developits best qualities. One may have a moral ego or a patriotic ego or an artisticego or a businessman’s ego, and so on. If morality is your ideal, live uprightlyand express your goodwill to all. That is real morality. It is pride that makesself-righteous persons so ready to judge those about them who are weak. Truemorality includes compassion for others in their ignorant wrongdoings.Those who are products of the material ego suffer much and needlessly. Suchpersons should learn self-control; otherwise they are just like pieces of matterin action—they have to smoke so many times a day, they must eat certain foods,they always get a headache if they miss their lunch, they can sleep only in aparticular kind of bed. It is all right to utilize creature comforts, but neverbe enslaved by them.If you are a cross between an intellectual and a materialistic ego, that isbetter. But unless you develop and maintain a balanced nature—intellectually,materially, and spiritually—you are not going to be happy. Your spiritualintuition tells you how to control your life, so that you are not mastered byit. It is unwise to let the materialistic ego govern your judgment; yourconscience and intuition should decide.The Conditions of Happiness: Plain Living, High ThinkingPlain living and high thinking should be your goal. Learn to carry all theconditions of happiness within yourself by meditating and attuning yourconsciousness to the ever-existing, ever-conscious, ever-new Joy, which is God.Your happiness should never be subject to any outside influence. Whatever yourenvironment is, don’t allow your inner peace to be touched by it. Analyzeyourself; make yourself what you should be and what you want to be. Peopleseldom learn true self-control; they do things that are detrimental to theirhighest welfare and think they are making themselves happy; but they are not. Tobe able to do things when and because you ought to do them, and to refrain fromdoing what you know is injurious—these are keys to real success and happiness.Don’t keep your mind engaged in too many activities. Analyze what you get fromthem, and see if they are really important. Don’t waste your time. To read agood book improves you much more than seeing movies. I often say, “If you readfor one hour, write in your spiritual diary for two hours; and if you write fortwo hours, think for three hours; and if you think for three hours, meditate allthe time.” No matter where I go, I keep my mind continuously on my soul peace.You too should always point the needle of your attention toward the North Poleof spiritual joy. Then no one can ever disturb your equilibrium.Remember, if each day does not find you a better person than you were the daybefore, you are going backward—in health, in mental peace, and in soul joy. Why?Because you don’t exercise enough control over your actions. You yourself madeyour habits, and you can change them. If you have been thinking wrongly, make upyour mind to be with good company and to study and meditate. A change of companycan make a great difference to you. When you come here, even for these fewhours, your mentality changes; you feel a refreshing peace. When you go to adance or a party your mind is often restless, nervous, and excited. Afterward,if you enter a different, calmer atmosphere, you feel more peaceful again. Thegreatest influence in your life, stronger even than your will power, is yourenvironment. Change that, if necessary. Until you are mentally strong, you cannever be what you want to be without a good environment to help you. When youare having difficulty in trying to change for the better, spiritual company andother uplifting influences are essential.Self-analysis is also essential to help you better yourself. If you can analyzeyourself fearlessly, you will be able to stand the critical analysis of otherswithout flinching.Those who like to dwell on the faults of others are human vultures. There isalready too much evil in the world. Don’t talk of evil, don’t think of evil, anddon’t do evil. Be like a rose, wafting to all the sweet fragrance of soulgoodness. Make everyone feel that you are a friend; that you are a helper, not adestroyer. If you want to be good, analyze yourself and develop the virtues inyou. Banish the thought that evil has any part in your nature, and it will dropoff. Make everyone else feel that you are an image of God, not by your words butby your behavior. Emphasize the light, and darkness will be no more. Study,meditate, and do good to others.Seclusion Is the Price of GreatnessSeclusion is the price of greatness. Be alone within. Don’t lead the aimlesslife that so many persons follow. Meditate and read good books more. There areso many inspiring things to know, and yet man spends his time foolishly.Happiness will never come if you don’t concentrate and act on the wisdom ofgreat men. Their thoughts are there to help you, in the scriptures and othertruthful books.So don’t waste time, constantly seeking new excitement. Once in a while it isall right to go to the movies and have a little social life, but mostly remainapart and live within yourself. Happiness depends on meditation, on knowinggreat minds through their thoughts in books, and on surrounding yourself withpeople who are noble and kind. Enjoy solitude; but when you want to mix withothers, do so with all your love and friendship, so that those persons cannotforget you, but remember always that they met someone who inspired them andturned their minds toward God.[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0017_split_000.html#footnote-078-backlink] Overeating and improper eatingcreate in the body excessive toxins that have a definite negative effect on themind, making it both sluggish and irritable. Occasional fasting on grape ororange juice has a cleansing effect on the system, which in turn vitalizes thebrain. Such fasts, undertaken one day a week, or occasionally for three days ata time, have been found effective in helping to keep the body properly cleansedof impurities. Fasting for longer than three days at a time should be under thesupervision of someone well trained in the science of fasting.2 [part0017_split_000.html#footnote-077-backlink] Serious research on the effectof diet and nutrition on mental health was begun many years after ParamahansaYogananda had made this observation. Persons from poverty areas who were deniedproper nourishment showed decidedly slower mental development and responses. Inaddition, science has shown that some forms of insanity (heretofore consideredincurable) improved remarkably with the simple administration of vitamins, andthat the causes of certain forms of depression, anxiety, and other emotions canbe traced to chemical imbalances in the system. (Publisher’s Note)"},{"pageContent":"Paramahansa Yogananda, 1926 [../images/00010.jpeg]Paramahansa Yogananda, 1926"},{"pageContent":"Healing by God’s Unlimited PowerSelf-Realization Fellowship Temple, Hollywood, California, August 31, 1947There are three kinds of illness: physical, mental, and spiritual. Physicalsickness is due to different forms of toxic conditions, infectious disease, andaccidents. Mental sickness is caused by fear, worry, anger, and other emotionalinharmonies. Soul sickness is due to man’s ignorance of his true relationshipwith God.Ignorance is the supreme disease. When one banishes ignorance he also banishesthe causes of all physical, mental, and spiritual disease. My guru, SriYukteswarji, often said, “Wisdom is the greatest cleanser.”Trying to overcome various kinds of suffering by the limited power of materialcurative methods is often disappointing. Only in the unlimited power ofspiritual methods may man find a permanent cure for the “dis-ease” of body,mind, and soul. That boundless power of healing is to be sought in God. If youhave suffered mentally over the loss of loved ones, you can find them again inGod. All things are possible with His help.Unless one really knows God, he is not justified in saying that only mind existsand that one does not need to obey health laws or to use any physical aids forhealing. Until actual realization is attained, one should use his common sensein all he does. At the same time one should never doubt God, but shouldconstantly affirm his faith in God’s omnipresent divine power.Doctors try to learn the causes of disease and to remove those causes so thatthe illnesses do not recur. In their use of many specific material methods ofcure, doctors are often very skillful. However, not every disease responds tomedicine and surgery, and therein lies the essential limitation of thesemethods.Chemicals and medicines affect only the outer physical composition of the bodilycells and do not alter the inner atomic structure or life principle of thecells. In many cases no cure of disease is possible until the healing power ofGod has corrected, from within, the imbalance of “lifetrons” or intelligent lifeenergy in the body. The two basic causes of disease are underactivity andoveractivity of the life energy, prana, that structures and sustains the body.The improper functioning of any one (or more) of the five governing praniccurrents—vyana, circulation; udana, metabolism; samana, assimilation; prana,crystallization; and apana, elimination—adversely affects bodily health. Whenthe natural harmonious balance of these subtle energies is restored by God’sdivine power, the atomic balance of the physical cells they nourish is restored;the healing is perfect, and often instantaneous. So long as balanced vitality ismaintained by right living, proper diet, and pranayama meditation (life-energycontrol techniques), the body’s own life energy “electrocutes” disease before itcan develop.Balanced Development Is EssentialInjury and disease are more often the cause of death than is old age. Mostpeople die before true old age has set in. In some cases, and they areexceptional, all parts of the body grow weak at once; such persons die, withoutpain, like ripe fruit that falls in due time from the tree. But the majority areplucked from the tree of life before they are really ripe for death.In most cases of death, one bodily part had ceased functioning before the rest.It may also happen that if one part is stronger or more developed than another,the resulting imbalance of the life force in the body may cause suffering andeven death. For example, someone with a weak heart in a strong-muscled body mayinjure his heart by overuse of his muscular strength. Sandow,1[part0018.html#footnote-084] “the strong man,” died at fifty-eight when a bloodvessel in his brain burst as a result of his having raised a car singlehanded.Overexercise that leads to unbalanced development may thus have harmfulconsequences.The Self-Realization Fellowship Energization Exercises2[part0018.html#footnote-083] place the least strain on the heart and provide fora uniform development of the body. Simple outdoor exercise, such as walking;balanced diet and moderation in eating; and quiet meditation are all conduciveto health.Obey Nature’s Laws and Have More Faith in GodA master may ignore, without ill effect, dietary and other rules for health. Theordinary individual, however, should be careful to maintain physical well-beingby right observance of the laws of nature.One’s diet should be wisely chosen. The body requires for health certain amountsof starch, protein, and fat, but in excess they can be harmful. Very littlestarch is necessary; bread is no longer held to be the “staff of life.” Too muchstarch in the diet, especially from white flour, causes an over-accumulation ofmucus in the body. (A certain amount of mucus is necessary, of course, toprevent the entry of harmful microbes into the mucous membranes.) Eat abundantlyof foods that contain a high proportion of mineral salts, such as fruits andvegetables. This type of diet prevents constipation, which, when present,predisposes the body to many diseases.Nature tries by reflex action to remove causes of physical distress. When dustgets into the eye, we involuntarily try to wink the dust away. When dirt or dustenters the nose, we sneeze. If we eat something unwholesome, we get rid of it byregurgitation. When disease attacks any internal organ of the body, natureprovides many means by which the organ may protect, defend, and renew itself.However, owing to various habits of living that alienate most men from nature,their innate powers of recuperation and rejuvenation become impaired and areprematurely lost.Harmful microbes are ceaselessly attacking the body; good ones are ceaselesslydefending it, aided sometimes by diet, herbs, medicines, and other healthmeasures. But an unlimited source of protection for man lies in his strongthought that, as a child of God, he cannot be affected by disease.Mind has much greater power than medicine. But to deny any power to medicine isunreasonable, because if drugs have no power, a man could take poison and notdie. While one should not deny the potency of medicines and drugs, one shouldunderstand that continuous dependence on them will prove their limitations; atime will come when they will lose their former efficacy in restoring the bodyto health. The only infinite power of healing lies in man’s mind and soul. Thebody cannot be healed by spiritual means if the mental power and faith are weak.Permanent healing comes through the boundless power of the mind and throughGod’s grace.Fruits, Vegetables, and Nuts Superior to MeatAccording to one school of thought, some diseases may be cured by eating theorgans of animals. A savage devours the heart of a lion in the belief that hisown heart will thus be invigorated. The tissues of chicken hearts are known tohave a strengthening effect on the heart of man; and the liver helps those whoare anemic. However, many health authorities state that iron- and vitamin-richfoods such as eggs, cashew nuts, soybeans, molasses, dried apricots, dried limabeans, dried peas, parsnips, spinach, and parsley may successfully besubstituted for liver in overcoming anemia. Pepsin taken from animal organs isuseful in cases of stomach ulcers; but papain, a substance very similar topepsin, is present in the fruit of the papaya, which is a valuable healing aidto those who suffer from any form of impaired digestion.When man is sick he may feel justified in eating anything that has healingvalue, but animal flesh is not actually necessary for this purpose; indeed, itmay increase the bodily burden by contributing toxins to the bloodstream. Thus,while flesh foods may aid in healing one illness, they sometimes create acondition whereby another disease may develop elsewhere in the body. That is whythe safest diet for man is fresh fruits, vegetables, finely ground nuts, andvegetable and dairy proteins. In certain cases the system may not tolerate rawfruits and vegetables, but the average person will benefit by including themdaily in his diet.In vegetables and fruits God has infused medicinal power to help in overcomingdisease. Even these, however, have but a limited potency. The organs of the bodyare essentially sustained by the energy of God, and the person who employsvarious methods to increase this energy will have at his command a greater powerfor healing than is afforded by any medicine or diet.Purify the Body of Harmful ToxinsThree-fourths of the body consists of water; hence the bodily demand for wateris much greater than that for food. (Death by thirst is a suffering more acutethan death by starvation.) It is important to give the body plenty of water.Drinking unsweetened fruit juices also is good. In localities where water has acalcium content high enough to dispose toward hardening of the arteries in man,he should take, instead, fruit juices and watermelons, cantaloupes, and similarjuicy fruits. Some health researchers say, however, that persons who have sinustrouble should not take citrus juices.Make it a point to drink plenty of liquids (and I do not mean soda-waterbeverages!) to wash away toxins in the body. But avoid drinking liquids withmeals, as this can be injurious to digestion. One tends to wash down the foodwithout chewing it properly. If starches are not partially digested in themouth, they often do not digest fully in the stomach. To chew food well isimportant—the stomach has no teeth. Hasty eating is harmful; particularly iflarge amounts of liquid are taken with the meal, thus diluting the gastricjuices. Also, drinking liquids with meals gives a tendency to obesity.It is important to keep the bloodstream healthy. Beef and pork may release intothe bloodstream toxic poisons and microbes. The white corpuscles try to destroythe microbes, but if the latter are strong and if the white corpuscles areinsufficient to resist them, toxic reactions set in. For meat eaters, fish,chicken, and lamb are preferable to beef and pork, which are highlyacid-producing.The most important principle in connection with eating is to avoid any form ofoverindulgence. As one learns to restrain himself he becomes healthier. It mayoften happen that one’s desire for a certain food is so great that he thinks hecannot resist it. His senses dictate to him, saying that he must eat that food,even when he knows it may be harmful to him. If he refuses to perpetuate his badhabits, he will find that he comes to dislike what is injurious and to like whatis beneficial. Greedy people fill themselves and still they are looking for morefood. By overeating, they dare to strain a heart-pump that has been overworkedfor perhaps forty years!Many persons thoughtlessly eat late at night. Usually sleep soon follows, duringwhich man’s internal machinery slows down. The food may lie in the stomachwithout being properly digested. Eating shortly before the nightly rest istherefore unwise.There is nothing worse for body and mind, however, than drinking intoxicatingliquors. Under their influence a man may do things that in his right mind hewould be ashamed to do. Violence, greed, lust for money and sex, even murder,may result from drunkenness. The belief that wine, sex experiences, and moneywill bring happiness is said by the sages to be the chief delusion that man mustovercome in order to realize his true nature.Liquor increases man’s desires for money and sex, and it is therefore the worstevil of the three. It is an unnecessary and extremely dangerous indulgence,because it stifles reason. A drunken man is no longer a true man. It is wisdomto strive to maintain only normal appetites.Increase Your Natural Resistance to DiseaseFasting is a natural method of healing. When animals or savages are sick, theyfast. The bodily machinery thus has an opportunity to cleanse itself and toobtain a much-needed rest. Most diseases can be cured by judicious fasting.3[part0018.html#footnote-082] Unless one has a weak heart, regular short fastshave been recommended by the yogis as an excellent health measure. Another goodmethod of physical healing is through suitable herbs or herb extracts.In using medicines, one often finds that they are not powerful enough to bringabout a healing, or that they are so powerful that they irritate the bodilytissues instead of healing them. Similarly, exposure to certain types of“healing rays” will burn the tissues. There are so many limitations in physicalmethods of healing!Better than medicines are the rays of the sun. In them is a wonderful healingpower. One should take a ten-minute sunbath every day. Ten minutes a day isbetter than only occasional exposure for longer periods.4[part0018.html#footnote-081] A short sunbath daily, reinforced by good healthhabits, will keep the body supplied with sufficient life energy to destroy allharmful microbes.Healthy persons possess a natural resistance to disease, and particularly toinfections. Illness comes when the resisting power of the blood has beendiminished by wrong eating or by overeating, or when overindulgence in sex hasdepleted the vital energy. To conserve the physical creative energy is to supplyall the cells with vibrant life energy; the body then possesses a tremendousresistance to disease. Sexual overindulgence weakens the body and renders itvulnerable to illness.You Can Increase Your Life SpanOne naturally has a better chance to overcome sickness in youth than in old age.(There are always exceptions, however, owing to karmic conditions.) The averagelength of life today5 [part0018.html#footnote-080] is sixty years. Many doctorsagree that it is easily possible to increase one’s life span by careful living.Mahavatar Babaji and a number of other great masters have lived for severalhundred years. Life may be prolonged indefinitely—not by food, medicine,exercise, sunbathing, and other limited means, but by contact with theimmeasurable power of God. We should think not only of the body but also of theSpirit. If we attain perfection in oneness with Spirit, we shall find perfectionin body also.6 [part0018.html#footnote-079]Many persons are continually busy looking after their physical welfare butneglect the development of their minds. The key to all power lies in the mind.If one fails to cultivate that power, when serious disease comes he may diewithout making any resistance, regardless of his age.The Power of a SmileConserve the vital energy, follow a balanced diet, and always smile and behappy. He who finds joy within himself discovers that his body is charged withelectric current, life energy, not from food but from God. If you feel that youcan’t smile, stand before a mirror and with your fingers pull your mouth into asmile. It is that important!The healing methods I have touched on briefly in connection with food and thecleansing of the body by herbs or fasting are limited in their effectiveness;but when one is joyful within, he invites the help of the inexhaustible power ofGod. I mean a sincere joyfulness, not that which you feign outwardly but do notfeel within. When your joy is sincere you are a smile-millionaire. A genuinesmile distributes the cosmic current, prana, to every body cell. The happy manis less subject to disease, for happiness actually attracts into the body agreater supply of the universal life energy.There are many things to talk about on this subject of healing. The main idea isthat we should depend more on mind power, which is illimitable. The rules forguarding against disease should be: self-control, exercise, proper eating,drinking plenty of fruit juices, occasional fasting, and smiling all thetime—from within. Those smiles come from meditation. You will find then theeternal power of God. When you are in ecstasy with Him you consciously bring Hishealing presence into your body.Permanent Healing Comes From GodMind power carries with it the unfailing energy of God; that is the power youwant in your body. And there is a way to bring in that power. The way iscommunion with God by meditation. When your communion with Him is perfect, thehealing is permanent. When the causative power of God comes, the healing effectis instantaneous; no time is required for cause to ripen into effect.Many people in distress try to evoke that power, but when they are not healed atonce they lose faith in the Lord instead of continuing to try to enlist His aid.The man who clings to the Divine is bound to be healed; because God knows thatthe devotee is praying, and He cannot but respond. But when you give up, theFather says, “All right. I see that you can do without Me. I shall wait foryou.”The Supreme Power may be invoked by continuous faith and unceasing prayer. Youshould eat rightly and do whatever else is necessary for the body, butcontinuously pray to Him: “Lord, Thou canst heal me because Thou dost controlthe life atoms and subtle conditions of the body that doctors cannot reach withmedicines.” The external factors of medicines and fasting have a certainbeneficial effect on the physical body, but they do not affect the inner forcethat sustains the cells. It is only when you go to God and receive His healingpower that the life energy is directed into the atoms of the bodily cells andproduces instantaneous healing. Wouldn’t you rather depend more on God?But the attempt to change one’s dependence from physical to spiritual methodsshould be gradual. If a man accustomed to overeating falls sick and, with theintention of trying to achieve a mental healing, abruptly starts fasting, he maybe discouraged if success is not forthcoming. It takes time to change one’s wayof thinking from dependence on food to dependence on mind. To be responsive tothe healing power of God, the mind must be trained to believe in divine aid.Out of that Great Power all atomic energy is throbbing, manifesting andsustaining every cell of the physical universe. As moving pictures are sustainedby a beam of light coming from the projection booth of a movie house, so are allof us sustained by the Cosmic Beam, the Divine Light pouring from the projectionbooth of Eternity. When you look to, and find that Beam, you will behold Itsunlimited power to rebuild the atoms and electrons and lifetrons in all bodycells that may be “out of order.” Commune with the Great Healer![../images/00011.jpeg]1 [part0018.html#footnote-084-backlink] Eugene Sandow (1867–1925), advocate ofphysical culture and wrestling, noted for his physique and physical prowess.

Their illness is mental: schizophrenia.At George Air Force Base, Victorville, California, twenty-five patientsunderwent fasting treatment for up to eighty-four days for obesity. Sixteencompleted the program, with weight losses of forty to one hundred pounds. Dr.Robert M. Karns, who conducted the experiment, also reported that aforty-eight-year-old diabetic patient, who was receiving twenty-five units ofinsulin daily before the fast, was able to discontinue the insulin treatmentafter the fast. A sixty-year-old patient reported improvement of an arthriticand heart condition.In experiments with mice, which are often the testing ground for treatment ofman’s disorders, it was demonstrated that the life-span could be increased byfifty percent.

Precautions should always be taken to protectsensitive skin against overexposure.

The vibration ofwords is, by extension, a grosser expression of the vibration of thoughts. Thethoughts of all men are vibrating in the ether.1 [part0019.html#footnote-089]Because thoughts have such a high vibratory rate, they have not yet beendetected there; but it is fortunate that we do not know the thoughts of all men.Through the instrumentality of radio, you can push a button and lo, you hearmusic and voices! If it were not for the intelligence in the ether, throughwhich the radio waves travel to your receiving set, you might hear all thedifferent broadcasts at once. God created the ether, and He planned that manwould create radio and radio-wave vibrations which could be transmitted andreceived through this medium. Radio waves depend on the ether for transmission,and on electricity for amplification in broadcasting and receiving. The soundsof radio broadcasting are always present in the ether, but are inaudible to uswithout a radio instrument. The vibratory radio-waves represent thoughts thatare being transmitted through space into any receiving set that is tuned in.When you are near and dear to someone, you can feel the thoughts of that person;but you are probably not able to do this with anyone as far away as India unlessyou have developed range. Those of you who practice regularly theSelf-Realization Fellowship Lessons on concentration and meditation, and arevery calm, will be able to feel the thoughts of others, even from a distance.Your mind will become more sensitive.We are all human radios: you receive the thought messages of others through yourheart,2 [part0019.html#footnote-088] the center of feeling, and broadcast yourown thought messages through the spiritual eye, the center of concentration andwill. Your antenna is in the medulla, the center of intuitivesuperconsciousness. Suppose you are away from home and you wish to perceive whatis happening there. If your feelings are very calm and your mind quiet, you willbe able to intuit the feelings and thoughts of your family at home. When youbecome capable of great concentration, your feeling can penetrate everywhere;your perception becomes charged with energy, with electricity.The World Is Only a Thought in the Mind of GodThere is in reality no space3 [part0019.html#footnote-087] between India andhere. But we are in America and we think we have to allow twenty-five days for asteamer trip before we can reach India. According to material consciousness timeis required to traverse such a distance. But energy cuts down space. If we go byairplane, the trip takes but seven days.4 [part0019.html#footnote-086] Thedistance is decreased by the increased energy of flight—the more energy, themore reduction of space or distance. Suppose you are sleeping and you dream thatyou are going to India. You take the train to New York, board the boat, stop atvarious ports of call, and arrive in Bombay. All this can be done in minutes inthe dream, because in thought there is no space. Or suppose I am dreaming that Iam dialing a radio and I tune in India. There is no space; it is all an idea inmy brain.The whole world exists only in thought, such is the power of mind. Space is amental concept. I can close my eyes and think of things that are two thousandmiles away, and yet all those miles are a mere expansion of thought. Space andtime are merely differentiations of thought. What is the difference between icecream and hot coffee in a dream experience? When you awaken, you realize that inthe dreamland ice cream was one thought and hot coffee another; they were merelytwo different ideas.Thought has omniscient power. The kind of thought I am speaking of is thethought of God. As He is omnipresent through thought, so are we. Are we notalready connecting the thought of America and the thought of India by radio?There is no space there.Often when you are trying to tune in a radio station, static comes in anddisturbs the program you are trying to hear. Likewise, when you are trying toaccomplish some personal transformation in your heart, “static” may interruptyour progress. That static is your bad habits.Fear Cannot Enter a Quiet HeartFear is another form of static that affects your mind-radio. Like good and badhabits, fear can be both constructive and destructive. For example, when a wifesays, “My husband will be displeased if I go out this evening; therefore I won’tgo,” she is motivated by loving fear, which is constructive. Loving fear andslavish fear are different. I am speaking of loving fear, which makes onecautious lest he hurt someone unnecessarily. Slavish fear paralyzes the will.Family members should entertain only loving fear, and never be afraid to speaktruth to one another. To perform dutiful actions or sacrifice your own wishesout of love for another person is much better than to do so out of fear. Andwhen you refrain from breaking divine laws, it should be out of love for God,not from fear of punishment.Fear comes from the heart. If ever you feel overcome by dread of some illness oraccident, you should inhale and exhale deeply, slowly, and rhythmically severaltimes, relaxing with each exhalation. This helps the circulation to becomenormal. If your heart is truly quiet you cannot feel fear at all.Anxieties are awakened in the heart through the consciousness of pain; hencefear is dependent on some prior experience—perhaps you once fell and broke yourleg, and so you learned to dread a repetition of that experience. When you dwellon such an apprehension your will is paralyzed, and your nerves also, and youmay indeed fall again and break your leg. Furthermore, when your heart becomesparalyzed by fear, your vitality is low and disease germs get a chance to invadeyour body.Be Cautious But Not FearfulThere is hardly anyone who does not fear disease. Fear was given to man as acautionary device to spare him pain; it is not meant to be cultivated andabused. Overindulgence in fear only cripples our efforts to ward offdifficulties. Cautious fear is wise, as when, knowing the principles of rightdiet, you reason, “I won’t eat that cake, because it is not good for me.” Butunreasoning apprehension is a cause of disease; it is the real germ of allsickness. Dread of disease precipitates disease. Through the very thought ofsickness you bring it on yourself. If you are constantly afraid of catching acold, you will be more susceptible to it, no matter what you do to prevent it.Do not paralyze your will and nerves with fear. When anxiety persists in spiteof your will, you are helping to create the very experience you are dreading.Also, it is unwise to associate more than is necessary and considerate withpeople who constantly discuss their own and other’s ailments and infirmities;this dwelling on the subject may sow seeds of apprehension in your mind. Thosewho are worried they are going to succumb to tuberculosis, cancer, hearttrouble, should cast out this fear, lest it bring about the unwelcome condition.Those who are already sick and infirm need as pleasant an environment aspossible, among people who have a strong and positive nature, to encourage themin positive thoughts and feelings. Thought has great power. Those who serve inhospitals seldom fall ill because of their confident attitude. They arevitalized by their energy and strong thoughts.For this reason, as you get older, it is best not to tell others your age. Assoon as you do, they see that age in you and associate it with diminishinghealth and vitality. The thought of advancing age creates anxiety, and thus youdevitalize yourself. So keep your age private. Say to God: “I am immortal. I amblessed with the privilege of good health, and I thank Thee.”Therefore be cautious, but not fearful. Take the precaution of going on apurifying diet now and then, so that any conditions of illness that may bepresent in the body will be eliminated. Do your best to remove the causes ofillness and then be absolutely unafraid. There are so many germs everywhere thatif you began to fear them you would not be able to enjoy life at all. Even withall your sanitary precautions, if you could look at your home through amicroscope you would lose all desire to eat!Techniques of Tuning Out FearWhatever it is that you fear, take your mind away from it and leave it to God.Have faith in Him. Much suffering is due simply to worry. Why suffer now whenthe malady has not yet come? Since most of our ills come through fear, if yougive up fear you will be free at once. The healing will be instant. Every night,before you sleep, affirm: “The Heavenly Father is with me; I am protected.”Mentally surround yourself with Spirit and His cosmic energy and think: “Anygerm that attacks me will be electrocuted.” Chant “Aum” three times, or the word“God.” That will shield you. You will feel His wonderful protection. Befearless. That is the only way to be healthy. If you commune with God His truthwill flow to you. You will know that you are the imperishable soul.Whenever you feel afraid, put your hand over your heart, next to the skin; rubfrom left to right, and say, “Father, I am free. Tune out this fear from myheart-radio.” Just as you tune out static on an ordinary radio, so if youcontinuously rub the heart from left to right, and continuously concentrate onthe thought that you want to tune out fear from your heart, it will go; and thejoy of God will be perceived.Fear Ceases With the Contact of GodFear is constantly haunting you. Cessation of fear comes with the contact ofGod, nothing else. Why wait? Through Yoga you can have that communion with Him.India has something to give you that no other nation has ever given. I oweeverything to my guru, Swami Sri Yukteswar; he was a master in every way. It wasby following his wisdom that I was able to succeed in my mission in the West. Hesaid, “Whatever you do, try to do it as nobody else has done it before.” If youremember that thought, you will succeed. Most people imitate others. You shouldbe original, and whatever you do, do well. All nature consciously communes withyou when you are in tune with God.We often consider ourselves first, but we should always include others in ourhappiness. When we do that from the goodness of our hearts, we spread abroad aspirit of mutual consideration. If everyone in a community of one thousandpersons behaved this way, each one would have nine hundred and ninety-ninefriends. But if everyone in that community behaved like an enemy to the other,each one would have nine hundred and ninety-nine enemies.Conquering the hearts of others by the power of love is the greatest victory youcan win in life. Always try to consider others first and you will find the wholeworld at your feet. That was the greatness of Jesus. He lived and died for all.Men of great material power who live only for themselves are soon forgotten, butthose who live completely for others are remembered forever. The King of Kingshad no throne of gold during his brief span on earth; but he has reigned fortwenty centuries on a throne of love in the hearts of millions of people. Thatis the best throne to have.A Single Thought May Lead to RedemptionWhen you came into this world you cried, whereas everyone else rejoiced. Duringyour lifetime, work and serve in such a way that when it is time for you toleave this world, you will smile at parting while the world cries for you. Holdthis thought and you will always remember to consider others before yourself.This vast world was made that you might use your intelligence to acquireknowledge of the Spirit, knowledge about your Self. Just one thought may redeemyou. You don’t realize how effectively your thoughts work in the ether.How would you know human love if God Himself didn’t give it to you by plantingHis love in the heart of each being? And since God is so kind and so loving,then He should be the object of your search. He doesn’t want to impose Himselfon you. But the mysterious working of your body, the intelligence He has givenyou, and every other wonder in life should be sufficient stimulus to make youdetermine to find God. Every human being would be redeemed if he would try. Youmust try!When I started in this path, my life at first was chaotic; but as I kept ontrying, things began to clear up for me in a marvelous way. Everything thathappened showed me that God is, and that He can be known in this life. When youfind God, what assurance and fearlessness you will have! Then nothing elsematters at all, nothing can ever make you afraid. Thus did Krishna exhort Arjunato face fearlessly the battle of life and become spiritually victorious:“Surrender not to unmanliness; it is unbecoming of thee. O Scorcher of Foes,forsake this small weak-heartedness! Arise!”5 [part0019.html#footnote-085][../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0019.html#footnote-089-backlink] The hypothetical ether is not considerednecessary to present scientific theory on the nature of the material universe.But Hindu scriptures refer to ether as a fine vibratory “background” on whichcreation is superimposed.

Indulgence in constant thoughts of fear, anger, melancholy, remorse,envy, sorrow, hatred, discontent, or worry; and lack of the necessities fornormal and happy living, such as right food, proper exercise, fresh air,sunshine, agreeable work and a purpose in life, all are the causes of nervousdisease.Any violent or persistent mental, emotional, or physical excitement greatlydisturbs and unbalances the flow of life force throughout the sensory-motormechanism and the lamps of the senses. If we connect a 120-volt bulb with a2,000-volt source, it would burn out the bulb. Similarly, the nervous system wasnot made to withstand the destructive force of intense emotion or persistentnegative thoughts and feelings.Far-Reaching Effects of NervousnessNervousness is no simple problem; it is a deadly enemy with far-reachingeffects. Physically, it is difficult to heal any disease so long as it isaggravated by nervousness. Spiritually, an imbalance of life force in the bodymakes it extremely hard for the devotee to concentrate or meditate deeply enoughto acquire peace and wisdom. But nervousness can be cured. The sufferer must bewilling to analyze his condition and remove the disintegrating emotions andnegative thoughts that are little by little destroying him. Objective analysisof one’s problems, and maintaining calmness in all situations of life will healthe most persistent case of nervousness.Realization that all power to think, speak, feel, and act comes from God, andthat He is ever with us, inspiring and guiding us, brings an instant freedomfrom nervousness. Flashes of divine joy will come with this realization;sometimes a deep illumination will pervade one’s being, banishing the veryconcept of fear. Like an ocean, the power of God sweeps in, surging through theheart in a cleansing flood, removing all obstructions of delusive doubt,nervousness, and fear. The delusion of matter, the consciousness of being only amortal body, is overcome by contacting the sweet serenity of Spirit, attainableby daily meditation. Then you know that the body is a little bubble of energy inHis cosmic sea.The victim of nervousness must understand his case, and must reflect on thosecontinual mistakes of thinking which are responsible for his maladjustment tolife. When the nervous man once admits to himself that his disease is notmysterious in its cause, but the logical outcome of his own habits, he isalready half cured.The Nervous SystemThe nervous system is the telephonic outlet and inlet of the body, providing manwith his response to outer and inner stimuli. Excitement upsets the nervousbalance, sending too much energy to some parts and depriving others of theirnormal share. This lack of proper distribution of nerve force is the sole causeof nervousness. The calm man—he who avoids excitement because he is not overlyattached to his ego and is aware that God, and not he, is running thisuniverse—is always able to meet any situation in life because his nerve force isequilibrated. Lord Krishna said: “The knower of Spirit, abiding in the SupremeBeing, with unswerving discrimination, free from delusion, is thus neitherjubilant at pleasant experiences nor downcast by unpleasant experiences.”1[part0020.html#footnote-090] This is the goal we must strive for and attain.The nervous system supplies life current to the brain, heart, and other parts ofthe body. It distributes energy to the five senses of sight, hearing, touch,taste, and smell. Nerves are our medium of contact with the outer world and thesource of all our sensory reactions. How important it is, therefore, to keep thenerves in a state of perfect balance, not shocking one part of the body with toomuch energy and consequently limiting the supply to other regions. Not byrestlessness or emotional reactions, but by calmness, by deep trust in God, wereach the yogic state of an equilibrated being.The yogis have special techniques by which one can revive tissues burned out bynervousness, by sending life energy into nerves partially destroyed bymistreatment. Each cell and tissue in the nervous system is a living,intelligent structure. Life energy can always renew it.Overcome Nervousness by Good CompanyNervousness is of two kinds—psychological and mechanical, or superficial andorganic. The psychological or most common variety is due to mind excitement.This condition, long continued in, and accompanied by association withuninspiring people and wrong diet and health habits, causes the chronic ororganic manifestations of nervous diseases.The diet should be simple, balanced, and not too plentiful. Exercise should beregular. Too much sleep drugs the nerves, and too little sleep is hurtful tothem. But all-important is the choice of company. Tell me what kind of friends aman has and I will tell you what he is. Flatterers do not help us. We shouldseek the society of superior men—those who tell us the truth and help us toimprove ourselves. He is our best friend who humbly suggests how we may benefitour life by worthwhile changes.Strong criticism, delivered in a mean or heartless way, is like hitting a man onthe head with a hammer. The power of love is infinitely more effective. Kindsuggestions, given with love and understanding, can accomplish wonders; merefault-finding accomplishes nothing. One is fit to judge others only after he hasperfected his own nature. Till then, judging oneself is the only profitableanalysis.Association with calm, wise people is one of the quickest ways to banishnervousness and realize our innate divinity. Nervous people should stay awayfrom those suffering from similar troubles.Calmness Is the Best CureThe best cure for nervousness is the cultivation of calmness. One who isnaturally calm does not lose his sense of reason, justice, or humor under anycircumstances. He can always separate sentiment or wishful thinking from fact.He is not led astray by the honeyed tongues of dishonest men with improbableschemes for acquiring unearned wealth. He does not poison his bodily tissueswith anger or fear, which adversely affect circulation. It is a well-proven factthat the milk of an angry mother can have a harmful effect on her child. Whatmore striking proof can we ask for, that violent emotions will finally reducethe body to an ignominious wreck?Poise is a beautiful quality. We should pattern our life by a triangular guide:calmness and sweetness are the two sides; the base is happiness. Every day, oneshould remind himself: “I am a prince of peace, sitting on the throne of poise,directing my kingdom of activity.” Whether one acts quickly or slowly, insolitude or in the busy marts of men, his center should be peaceful, poised.Christ is an example of that ideal. Everywhere, he demonstrated peace. He passedthrough every conceivable test without losing his poise.God is everywhere, controlling planets, galaxies; yet He is not disturbed.Though He is in this world, yet He is above this world. We must reflect Hisimage and likeness. We must meditate often and hold on to the peacefulaftereffects. We must send out thoughts of love, goodwill, harmony. In thetemple of meditation, with the light of intuition burning on the altar, there isno restlessness, no nervous striving or searching. Man is truly home at last, ina sanctuary not made with hands, but with God-peace.[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0020.html#footnote-090-backlink] Bhagavad Gita V:20."},{"pageContent":"The Physical and Spiritual Rewards of FastingSelf-Realization Fellowship International Headquarters, Los Angeles, California,March 9, 1939The physical results and spiritual experiences of fasting are wonderful. Thespirit within becomes disassociated from the demands of the body as the bodyitself is freed from gross habits. I have just passed my thirtieth day ofdieting and fasting, and it seems as natural as if I had never eaten. All of youwho are able should go on a three-day fast; if possible, a longer one.1[part0021.html#footnote-094] You would begin to discover that you can livewithout food.Pains or aches in the body indicate that something is going wrong with itsmachinery; repairs are needed. Think how conscientiously you keep your autoclean and in good repair. Much more complex than any car is the human body; andthe Lord wants you to keep it clean and in good running order, also, while atthe same time depending more on Him. The secret of good health does not lie onlyin chemicals; one should rely even more on God’s energy within.This life force within our bodies is, in fact, the source of life. It is aconscious power: the creator of the organs, and the supplier of their vitalityas well. Ordinarily, life force is continually reinforced by mind power andfood. But if it has been too much misused, it gives up and refuses to workanymore. Its power may grow dim in the eyes, for example, and then you cannotsee well. No food gives strength, no change of air invigorates, nothing canrestore energy to the body when its life force begins to diminish.Fasting gives rest to the overworked organs, the bodily engines; and also to thelife force itself, relieving it of extra work. When you cease to make the lifeforce feel it has to depend for its existence on external sources—food, water,oxygen, sunshine—it becomes self-supporting, independent.It is overeating for three hundred and sixty-five days of the year that createsmany kinds of disease. Undeviating regularity in eating, whether the systemactually needs food or not, is also a curse to the body. The more youconcentrate on the palate, the more disease you will have. To enjoy food is allright, but to be a slave to it is the bane of life. Why should you let naturehurt you? Nature cannot punish you if you are not attached to the body or boundby food. You must recognize that life force is the sustainer of the body.Without being fanatic, place the greatest emphasis on the mind, with the objectof making its power more and more dependable. If you insist on making your minda slave to your body, the mind will take revenge. It will relinquish its power,so that you will have to depend on someone or something else to help you; and nodoctor or medicine can help any patient if the patient’s mind has become soweakened that the disease has become chronic. Three-fourths of the cure lies inthe mind.In India, we teach how to conquer the body so that one can rely to a greaterdegree on the mind. Those who constantly look to physical means for health andhealing will be dependent on them always. But mental power is superior. Oneshould learn gradually to make greater use of the mind. By doing so, you willrealize that the mind is a superb instrument. Whatever you command, it will do.This I have seen in my own life.One day when I was giving a lecture in Milwaukee, it was terribly hot; my facewas streaming perspiration, but I couldn’t find my handkerchief. For a moment Ididn’t know what to do. Then I put my consciousness at the Christ center andinwardly said, “Lord, my body is cool.” At once all perspiration disappeared,and my body felt cool as could be! So it is good to try to depend more on mind.However, you cannot deny the body entirely; if you truly did so, you wouldn’tthink or eat or move.Some are interested in the power of mind over body principally to demonstratehealth. But health is not the purpose of life. Communion with God is the purposeof life. You may feel well for a while, but a time comes when nothing avails.Then who will help you? God. Fasting is one of the great ways of approachingGod: it releases the life force from enslavement to food, showing you that it isGod who really sustains the life in your body.But the temptation of Satan is that as soon as the mind thinks “food,” you wantto eat. Once, as a little boy in India, I had a cold and I wanted to eat sometamarind, which is considered very bad for colds. My sister stronglydisapproved, but because of my insistence she grudgingly brought me some of thefruit. I took one piece, chewed it, and spit it out. Without my swallowing thetamarind, the desire for its taste was satisfied. Since man all too oftenacquires the habit of greed, it is unfortunate for him that God didn’t createthe body in such a way that he could enjoy the sense of taste and let damagingexcess or unhealthful food bypass the organs of digestion and assimilation!Self-Control—the Sanest Way to Health and HappinessBut in truth the only way to health and happiness, and the sanest way, isself-control. To be master of yourself, so that you are not overpowered by yoursenses, is one of the greatest blessings you can have. If you overload a wiringsystem with too much electricity, it burns out. And every time you load yourdigestive system with too much food, the life force burns out. When you refrainfrom overeating, and when you fast, the life force takes rest and becomesrecharged.If your auto is not working properly, you send it to a garage. It runs betterfor a while, and then something else goes wrong and you send it back for furtherrepairs. The same must be done for the body. The physical effects of fasting areremarkable. A fast of three days on orange juice will repair the bodytemporarily, but a long fast will completely overhaul it.2[part0021.html#footnote-093] Your body will feel as strong as steel. But if youwant a permanent overhaul, then you must also watch at all times what, and howmuch, food you take into your body.Know the Right Way to FastIn fasting you must know what to do. That is why proper supervision is necessaryfor a fast longer than three days. I don’t advise anyone to make his first fasta long one, for he will become weak. A one-day fast on fruit each week, or athree-day fast on orange juice each month, are good ways to accustom oneself tofasting. The faster must be mentally prepared for those who will immediatelybegin to sympathize and tell him that he will become sick and die if he doesn’teat. It is true that on a longer fast you may feel weak during the first fewdays, because the life force has been accustomed to dependence on food. Butgradually, as the days pass, you no longer feel any weakness. Your life forceand spirit become detached from food. You see that the body is sustained by lifeforce alone.I know the secret by which one can fast and still not lose weight. The lifeforce, when under one’s conscious control, may be utilized to take off flesh orto keep the body at normal weight. Either way, it is effective. When thisprinciple is applied, the normal temperature of the body does not go down, nomatter how long one fasts. Drawing energy from the medulla, the “mouth of God,”3[part0021.html#footnote-092] the life force begins to rely more and more on itsinnate regenerative power instead of depending on outside sources.Human beings in a perfect state of suspended animation can be buried for fivethousand years or unto eternity and remain alive. Life is eternal. It dependsnot on breath, nor on food, water, or sunshine. Remember always that you are theImperishable Spirit. This is the way to live.Our consciousness survives after death, but the ordinary man loses that feelingof continuity and so thinks he is dead. Every one of us is going to die someday,so there is no use in being afraid of death. You don’t feel miserable at theprospect of losing consciousness of your body in sleep; you accept sleep as astate of freedom to look forward to. So is death; it is a state of rest, apension from this life. There is nothing to fear. When death comes, laugh at it.Death is only an experience through which you are meant to learn a great lesson:you cannot die. Why wait for death when you can realize this now? The firstlesson you have to learn is that life is not dependent on food. By fasting youcan prove it to yourself.Function Well Under All CircumstancesEveryone should develop his mental power, so that he is able to function wellunder all circumstances—sleep or no sleep, food or no food, vacation or novacation. Regularity is admirable and necessary; we must acquire the habit ofregularity in order to obey the laws of God. But to be unable to deviate fromthat habit without ill effect is wrong.All the fundamental habits of a child are formed between the ages of three andseven. Good environment will help to guide his development, but to change (ifdesirable) the salient tendencies of a child, special training is required. Inmy school in Ranchi, India, I gave the boys rigid training of the body. Theyfasted often, and slept on a blanket on the floor, never using pillows.Sometimes they meditated for hours. To help children by rigid discipline to befree from the tyranny of the body is to confer on them a lifelong blessing. Oneof the schoolboys sat for twelve hours in meditation without winking his eyes.If you had such poise, how much happier you would be! How much more peace youwould have! The greatest training lies in scientific, balanced discipline of thebody, mind, and spirit. And in that lies the heart of fasting.The Metaphysical Science Behind FastingThere is a great metaphysical science behind fasting. Jesus reminded us of thistruth when he said: “Man shall not live by bread alone....” Two things keep youbound to earth: breath and “bread.” In sleep, however, you are peacefullyunaware of any need for either breath or food; your spirit is detached frombody-consciousness. Fasting uplifts the mind in the same way. Through fasting,let your mind depend on its own power. When that power manifests, the life forcein the body becomes increasingly reinforced with the eternal energy continuallyflowing into the brain and spine from the cosmic energy around the body,entering through the medulla. Becoming detached from dependence on outerphysical sources of bodily sustenance, the life force sees that it is beingsupported from within, and wonders how this is so. The mind then says: “Thesolids on which the body used to depend are nothing more than grosscondensations of energy. You are pure energy. And you are pure consciousness.”Then, whatever command the mind impinges on the consciousness of the life force,it will manifest accordingly.Anything can be done by mind power. So you see how unjust it is to the mind andto the all-powerful life force within you, to say you can’t live without food.Make your life and body impervious to suffering. Conquer yourself. By longfasting you realize that everything is mind.Every force and object in this universe is a product of the Divine Mind, in thesame way that all the things you perceive in a dream are creations of your ownmind. On the conscious plane also, if your mind creates the thought that thebody will be weak from fasting, it will be weak; or if you have been fasting,and momentarily think it is making you weak, the body will actually feel weak.But if you make up your mind that the body is strong, it will not feel anyweakness; rather, it will feel great power. Most people do not know this becausethey have never tried it. The mind will not show its miracles unless you make itwork. And it will not work so long as you continue to depend more and more onmaterial things. That is why its marvels remain hidden from ordinary vision. Butwhen, through fasting, you learn how to depend on mind, it will work ineverything, whether conquering disease, or creating prosperity, or realizing thesupreme goal of life—finding God. “The self-governed yogi—he whose mind is fullyunder control—thus engaging his soul in ceaseless meditative union with Spirit,attains the peace of My being: the final Nirvana (deliverance).”4[part0021.html#footnote-091][../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0021.html#footnote-094-backlink] Persons in good health should experienceno difficulty in fasting for three days; longer fasts should be undertaken onlyunder experienced supervision. Anyone suffering from a chronic ailment or anorganic defect should fast only upon the advice of a physician experienced infasting procedures.2 [part0021.html#footnote-093-backlink] See previous footnote.3 [part0021.html#footnote-092-backlink] Matthew 4:4: “Man shall not live bybread alone, but by every word (prana, life energy) that proceedeth out of themouth of God (that flows forth from the medulla into the body).” It is throughthe center of superconsciousness in the medulla that God breathes his“word”—cosmic intelligent vibration, or energy—into man. A reservoir of thisenergy accumulates in the brain. Thence it flows down from the medulla into thefive spiritual centers (chakras) in the spine, which act as distributors,feeding this life energy to all parts of the body.4 [part0021.html#footnote-091-backlink] Bhagavad Gita VI:15."},{"pageContent":"Self-realization:Criterion of ReligionSelf-Realization Fellowship Temple, Los Angeles, California, August 22, 1933First Self-Realization Fellowship Temple, Encinitas, California, August 27, 1939(Compilation)The temple God loves most is the temple of His devotee’s inner silence andpeace. Whenever you enter this beautiful temple here,1[part0022.html#footnote-104] leave restlessness and worries behind. If you donot let go of them, God will not be able to come to you. First establish inyourself a temple of beauty and peace; there you will find Him, on the altar ofyour soul.Sometimes one feels discouraged, thinking it is too late to find God. It isnever too late. The Bhagavad Gita teaches that if one realizes that this worldis false and only Spirit is real, though it be in the last moment before death,he will enter a better world after his earth-exit.2 [part0022.html#footnote-103]Sooner or later each one of us will be taken away from this earth. Find out nowwhat life is all about. The great purpose of your experiences here is tostimulate you to search out their meaning. Don’t give importance to thisprocession of humanity. As time marches on, you must eventually realize that youare a part of the great One. Make God-realization your goal. Mahavatar Babajisaid that even a little bit of this dharma—righteous action, seeking to knowGod—will save you from dire fears.3 [part0022.html#footnote-102] The prospect ofdeath, or of failure or other grievous troubles, awakens in man a great dread.When you are helpless to help yourself, when your family cannot do anything foryou, when no one else can give you aid, what then is the state of your mind? Whyallow yourself to be put in such a position? Find God, and anchor yourself inHim. Before anyone else was with you, who was with you? God. And when you leavethis earth, who will be with you? Only God. But you won’t be able to know Himthen unless you make friends with Him now. If you deeply seek God, you will findHim.Everything in creation is a temptation to lure you from God. But He is moretempting than any earthly temptation. If you attain even a glimpse of Him youwill realize this; and you can find Him by inner prayer and meditation and bystrong determination. Your resolutions with God must be firm; He will not comeso long as your mind is roaming elsewhere. He wants to come to you but you don’tlet Him; you would rather seek a little sense pleasure or spend your time onbooks or cocktail parties. So God says, “All right, My child, play on.”If God is seeking anything, it is our love. He knocks at every heart and asks usto come unto Him, but most persons don’t want to go. Yet when they get intotrouble or become sick, they are quick to call for Him. He who makes friendswith the Lord while he is prosperous and happy will always find God near when heneeds Him. But he who procrastinates in forming that relationship will have tofight his tests alone until, through wisdom and unconditional surrender, hefinds the Eternal Friend.Out of this great mass of humanity only a few are deeply seeking God. Where arethey who thought this earth was theirs two hundred years ago? All are gone—andfrom among them perhaps only a few understood the truth about life and becameSelf-realized devotees of the Lord. Nevertheless, each succeeding generationthinks this life is real! For the little while you are here you make much ofthis show. Don’t become too involved in it. Find God! He is trying to draw uswith His love. He is showing us all the miracles we could want to see—thewonders of growing things and the perfect routine in nature. He is right therebehind the flowers. Seek Him out. The scientist didn’t make his discoveries bythe use of blind prayer; he followed the laws of science. If you applyscientific spiritual laws with sincere devotion, God will be with youautomatically. Open your eyes of devotion, for by continuous ardor plusapplication of spiritual law you will find Him.Spiritual Development Must Balance Material AdvancementDifferent nations have specialized in different arts and sciences; Indiamastered the scientific art of God-realization. I have come to teach you India’sspiritual science. Unless a balance is created by developing spiritualrealization along with advancement of the physical sciences, individuals andnations will be lost in misery and destruction. If today’s world leaders wereillumined by Self-realization, and worked together, they could within a fewyears banish war and poverty from the earth. Only spiritualconsciousness—realization of God’s presence in oneself and in every other livingbeing—can save the world. I see no chance for peace without it. Begin withyourself. There is no time to waste. It is your duty to do your part to bringGod’s kingdom on earth.Many persons hesitate to seek God, imagining that life will then have to begloomy. Not so! The unalloyed happiness I find in communing with the Lord nowords can describe. Night and day I am in a state of joy. That joy is God. Toknow Him is to perform the funeral rites for all your sorrows. He does notrequire you to be stoic and morose. This is not the right concept of God, northe way to please Him. Without being happy you will not even be able to findHim. The more peaceful you are, the more you will be able to feel His presence.The happier you are, the greater will be your attunement with Him. Those whoknow Him are always happy, because God is joy itself.People try to find happiness in drink, sex, and money, but the pages of historyare filled with tales of their disillusionment. The time I have spent inmeditation has made my life unimaginably fruitful. A thousand bottles of winecould not produce the joy it has given me. In that joy is the conscious guidanceof God’s wisdom. When you are attuned with Him in this way, even though youunwittingly do wrong it will be righted by the Lord’s omniscient direction; ifyou make a poor judgment it will be corrected by Him.Wait no longer! Whoever hears this message, know that I am speaking truth. It isHis voice, His power, His authority. If I were to display all the powers thatGod has given to me, throngs would come. But I do not seek that kind offollowing. Not powers, but the love of God must attract you; for only then willyou change and make an effort to know Him. That is my aim.I could not preach about God in this way if I did not know Him. In the same wayyou can know Him. That is why I stress Self-realization, which means you canknow within your own consciousness that what I am saying is true. You don’t haveto believe; you can know. If I had a thousand mouths, I would speak through themall to convince you.My Only Wish Is to Give You a Glimpse of GodYou don’t realize how much you miss God, because you have never known Him. Onceyou do contact Him, no power on earth will be able to turn you away from Him. Myonly wish is to give you a glimpse of God, because having Him, no other gain isgreater. Satan tempted Jesus with dominion over the whole world; but he said,“Get thee behind me, Satan.”4 [part0022.html#footnote-101] Jesus had thatSomething which is infinitely greater. Knowing God is more satisfying than thefulfillment of any earthly desire. Every lesser wish of your heart will be takencare of when you have Him who is your greatest Treasure. This is my own truetestimony. He fulfilled my every desire. I do not seek things now; they seek me.When God gives Himself to you, He will fulfill your slightest wish. It is notnecessary to ask. That is the state you want. But first you have to prove thatyou desire the Lord Himself more than His gifts.Out of the abundance God has given me I have kept nothing for myself. I amalways free, for nothing belongs to me. I am working only for Him and for all ofyou. Because of this, anytime the thought of some need crosses my mind, Godfulfills it. I have to take care what I mentally tell the Lord, for it is sureto materialize! This state of satisfaction no worldly prosperity can give.God is seeking you; you must seek Him. Follow this Self-Realization way. It willbring you to Him more quickly than any other path. I have tried all methods; andI entered this path on the basis of reason, not emotion. Through thedemonstration of their own realization, the great masters of Self-RealizationFellowship have shown that by following their way you can find the Lord, you canbe among the greatest of the spiritually great, just as by learning from a greatscientist you can become a great scientist, if you apply yourself. Charcoal doesnot receive and reflect the sunlight, but the diamond does. Charcoalmentalities, full of doubts and negation and spiritual slothfulness, cannotreceive God. But diamond mentalities, sincere and full of faith andperseverance, receive and reflect the wisdom of Divine Consciousness.It Is Necessary to Understand the Meaning of ReligionTo most persons religion is a matter of family tradition or social benefit ormoral habit. They have no conception of the importance of religion. When I askedone man what religion he followed, he replied: “Nothing in particular. I changechurches according to convenience.”Those who are not seeking God as the paramount necessity of life do notunderstand the meaning of religion. Why do all people seek money? Because theyare conditioned to the thought that money is essential to supply the things theyneed for their well-being. They don’t have to be told this; they simply know it.Why then do most people not understand the necessity of knowing God? Becausethey lack imagination and discrimination. Very early in life I saw thattheological and even scriptural answers to certain questions could never fullysatisfy the soul, unless their truth were experienced through realization andGod-communion. For example, when my mother died and when other loved ones beganto be taken away from me, I rebelled inwardly against it; but no one could giveme an explanation that satisfied me. I decided I had to go find the answermyself, through my own effort. “I am not going to accept this blindly,” I vowed.“I am going to find the answer from Him who is the Maker of this universe.” Isought directly from God the understanding of life’s mysteries that I could notfind in the teachings in the churches and temples. If religion could not satisfyme as to why some persons are born poor and some rich, some blind and somehealthy, how could it convince me of the justice of God? The masters of India,by attaining God-communion, found the answers to life’s riddles through innerrealization, and showed us how we can do likewise.There are many kinds of religionists in the world, and each religion has its owncross-section of this diversity. There are those whose approach to religion iswholly emotional. When their feelings are played upon too much they becomehysterical with religion. But in an extreme display of emotion one loses touchwith God. Emotionally excitable types want “pep” in religion; when you lecturefrom the intellectual plane they fall asleep. It is too dull, they say. Butplaying upon others’ emotions is simply juggling with their minds; it is notgiving them Truth, or God.The intellectual religionist delights in hearing about various theological orphilosophical concepts, flattering himself that he is on a higher rung of divineunderstanding than the emotional religionist. But intellectual stimulation,also, is only another kind of “drug,” a different form of mental juggling thatdoes not give the seeker what he really needs, any more than does over-stirringof the emotions.Religionists who cling blindly to dogma will often parrot what they do notreally understand or have not realized. When you ask them questions, they quotescriptures and tenets like spiritual victrolas. It is useless to reason withthem because they are so sure they know it all.True Religion Satisfies the Demands of Your SoulDogmatic religionists are convinced that if you do not believe in a certain wayyou are doomed. Science does not teach you in that way; it proves its points.And true religion satisfies the demands of your soul, not by words but by proof.I wanted never to be so dogmatic that I would stop using my reason and commonsense. When I met my guru, Sri Yukteswar, he said: “Many teachers will tell youto believe; then they put out your eyes of reason and instruct you to followonly their logic. But I want you to keep your eyes of reason open; in addition,I will open in you another eye, the eye of wisdom.”5[part0022.html#footnote-100] Sri Yukteswarji gave me a teaching whose truth Icould realize for myself. That is why I followed this path. No one can shake mefrom it.The liberalist is the other extreme of the dogmatist. He follows everything! Inthe belief that he is being broadminded he says, “All spiritual paths are good;therefore I will not bind myself to any one of them.” While respecting all, itis better to adhere to one path than to be a religious butterfly, flittingeverywhere. Avoid both false liberality and blind dogmatism. Cling dogmaticallyonly to wisdom, and you will find God.Every effort one makes for God will be noticed by Him. However, if one doesn’tfollow a proven scientific way to God, his progress is comparable to riding inan old bullock cart. Sincere seekers will receive some realization, no matterwhat path they follow; but with only blind belief and mechanical prayers itcould take them incarnations to reach the Lord.Whatever Religion You Choose, Give It a Good TestSeek until you find the path most suited to the spiritual inclination of yourheart and mind, and then be steadfast. Whatever you take up, give it a goodtest. In the same way give the Self-Realization teachings a chance. Jewelers cantell a good gem from a fake, and the genuine spiritual teacher can differentiatebetween sincere and idle seekers. There are some who take the Self-RealizationFellowship Lessons but do not study or practice them. Ask them what the teachingis about, and they reply vaguely, “Oh, it is grand!” If you ask what they havelearned, they go on about what a good teaching it is, “but I haven’t practicedit.” Those who practice know the blessings of this path.Seekers should be taught to find God first. To concentrate on money or health asprimary objectives in following a religion is to become sidetracked. True, it isthrough God that one receives everything else; but he who seeks other thingsfirst will feel the bonds of limitations. A qualified spiritual teacher knowsand loves the Lord; his supreme interest is in God. One teacher tried topersuade me to accept his spiritual guidance with the promise that I would havea great many followers. His offer did not attract me, because I wanted Godalone. Great teachers will always seek to interest you in knowing the Lord. Theywill not take you up a blind alley.Without God-communion, the lifeblood of religion is missing. Church is not theplace for dances, movies, and frequent social gatherings. These divert peoplefrom God. One can find sufficient worldly entertainment in town. Go to churchfor one reason: communion with God. Divine communion is the criterion ofreligion. That is what my Guru taught me, and that is why I have followed himunconditionally and wholeheartedly. As a result of his teaching I am enjoyingthat sacred communion with the Lord every moment of my existence. That is whatreligion must be.If I tell you of a wonderful fruit I have found, and describe it to you indetail every day for a year without ever giving you a taste of it, you won’t besatisfied. Hearing about truth cannot relieve the soul’s hunger; if you arecontent to hear truth without making any effort to know God, it has falselysatisfied you. You must hunger so deeply for God that you will seek Him out inearnest. The purpose of religious lectures and sermons is to awaken in you thatirresistible soul-longing for Him.Realizing God Requires Self-Disciplinary EffortOnce in a while I meet someone in whom I see a little bit of real devotion forthe Lord. But God-realization is so much greater than that! The God-knowingdevotee sometimes sees the whole world filled with His light—a wonderfulexperience. But it can’t come to you in one minute. Realizing God requires longperseverance in the practice of those methods that lead to Self-realization.The desire for happiness is the strongest desire of all. True and lastinghappiness is found in God. When you discover Him, a great joy will come overyou, a joy you will find nowhere else. Sri Yukteswarji said to me: “When yourjoy in meditation and communion becomes greater than any other joy, you havefound God.6 [part0022.html#footnote-099] If the whole world were given to you,you would not know what to do with it; you would only feel burdened, worryingabout everything. Study the lives of princes and men of the world; see how theywere vexed.” We are like puppets in the hands of destiny; but the man who is onewith the Light of the world, who has nothing and yet has everything, is a happyman. He who is one with God is not afraid of anything, even annihilation of thebody. Jesus said: “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”7[part0022.html#footnote-098]The church has become a beggar. Ironically, money is needed in the developmentof all good works, including those performed by the church. The dollar itselfhas no brains; it can serve both good and evil schemes. To seek money to spreadGod’s work is righteous action. Money thus used is doing good. And the more onesacrifices for God’s work, the greater will be his reward.All Churches Should Be Hives of God-CommunionEvery church does good, and for that I love them all. They will truly fulfilltheir high calling when they become places of God-communion. They should be likehives, filled with the honey of God-realization. Unless this truth becomes moremanifest in religion, you will see that the church as such will graduallydisappear. Religion will be practiced in secluded spots out-of-doors, where Godcan come to those few devoted souls who really want to know Him. This hashappened in India. Some of her temples have become not so much places ofmeditation for divine communion as mere gathering places for pigeons and people.Real seekers in India gather under the trees to meditate on God. More and morethis will happen in churches everywhere. The dissatisfaction of real truthseekers with dogmatism, and the emptiness of organization without individualSelf-realization, will force a great world change in the concept of religion.Scientific Methods Needed to Follow the First Commandment“Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, andwith all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.”8[part0022.html#footnote-097] These two commandments sum up the whole purpose ofreligion. If you sincerely love God you will do only what is based upon truth.Your love will not allow you to err against Him. Bring in the light, anddarkness will vanish as though it had never been. Bring in love of God and thedarkness of ignorance flies away. The science of yoga explains the truth behindthe first commandment, and gives definite scientific techniques that enable thedevotee to attain the divine communion necessary in order to love God socompletely. Behind each part of these commandments is a deep metaphysical truth:“Love the Lord...with all thy heart”: It is God who has given you the power tolove your family and friends. Why should you not use that power to love Him asyou love your dearest ones on earth? You should be able to say: “My Lord, I loveYou as the father loves the child, as the lover loves the beloved, as the friendloves the friend, as the master loves the servant. I love You with the strengthof all human loves, for Thou art my Father, my Mother, my Friend, my Master, myBeloved.” When you truly love God with all your heart, you feel that love forHim day and night.As I was leaving home to seek God I was inwardly torn by the conflict ofloyalties. My father had done everything for me, and the whole family was cryingover my imminent departure; but the love of God was stronger, and I was able toovercome the limitations of familial love.Many human beings say “I love you” one day and reject you the next. That is notlove. One whose heart is filled with the love of God cannot willfully hurtanyone. When you love God without reservation, He fills your heart with Hisunconditional love for all. That love no human tongue can describe.“...and with all thy soul”: You cannot fulfill this part of the commandmentunless you know your soul. You know it in an unconscious way each night, for indeep sleep you are aware only of existing; you have no consciousness of beingeither man or woman. You are soul. You can consciously know your soul—your trueself—by meditation. And when you know yourself as soul you will have discoveredthe presence of God within you. The moon’s reflection cannot be seen clearly inruffled water, but when the water’s surface is calm a perfect reflection of themoon appears. So with the mind: when it is calm you see clearly reflected themoonèd face of the soul. As souls we are reflections of God. When by meditationtechniques we withdraw restless thoughts from the lake of the mind, we beholdour soul, a perfect reflection of Spirit, and realize that the soul and God areOne.“...and with all thy strength”: This aspect of the commandment is highlyscientific. It means withdrawing all your strength—all your energies andconsciousness—into their source, which is God. Yoga teaches you how to controlyour life energies and transmute them from body-consciousness intoGod-consciousness.“...and with all thy mind”: When you are praying to God, your attention andconcentration should be wholly on Him. You should not be thinking about yourSunday dinner or your work or any other worries and desires. The Lord knows yourthoughts. Krishna said: “Whenever the fickle and restless mind wanders away—forwhatever reason—let the yogi withdraw it from those distractions and return itto the sole control of the Self.”9 [part0022.html#footnote-096] When I pray toGod, my mind stays riveted on Him. If you develop that calm intensity ofconcentration you will find that a time comes when no matter what else you aredoing, days and nights pass with your mind inwardly absorbed in God.“...and thy neighbor as thyself”: The ordinary man is incapable of loving othersin this way. Self-centered in the consciousness of “I, me, and mine,” he has notyet discovered the omnipresent God who resides in him and in all other beings.To me there is no difference between one person and another; I behold all assoul-reflections of the one God.10 [part0022.html#footnote-095] I can’t think ofanyone as a stranger, for I know that we are all part of the One Spirit. Whenyou experience the true meaning of religion, which is to know God, you willrealize that He is your Self, and that He exists equally and impartially in allbeings. Then you will be able to love others as your own Self.Self-realization Converts Conviction Into ExperienceTruth alone should be the binding force of religion. Truth I have brought to youthrough Self-Realization Fellowship. This work is spreading because of thewisdom and blessings of the God-realized Masters behind it. All over the countryI have seen wonderful students who are held to this spiritual path for onereason: Self-realization. My only plan to hold people is by their ownSelf-realization. That is the only way I wish to hold them. If there arehundreds in my classes, all right; if there are empty seats, it is all right. Inever wish for anything. I would rather have a few real souls than hundredswithout sincerity. The great purpose behind this movement is to give peopletheir own Self-realization. When people will realize that it is their duty andprivilege to know God, then a new era will come on earth. Scriptures, sermons,and lectures eventually cease to satisfy the seeker who truly longs to feel thepresence of God; but when he realizes truth, he knows life as it should be.Practice the truth you hear and read about, so that it is not just an idea but aconviction born of experience. If reading books on theology satisfies yourdesire for God, you have not grasped the purpose of religion. Do not settle forintellectual satisfaction about truth. Convert truth into experience, and youwill know God through your own Self-realization.Practice Truth—Meditate—for God-CommunionWhat is needed is spiritual experience. Only divine communion can remove thegreat boredom that exists when one is not following the spiritual pathscientifically. What is necessary in order to have that spiritual experience?The habit of daily meditation. God is realizable. You can know Him now, throughmeditation. Then without any question, without any doubt, without a speck ofmental reservation you can say: “I am with God.” Why not? He is your own.The time has come for man to know truth for himself. That which I am giving toyou is self-realizable. To some the Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons may seemjust another course of philosophical study, to be added to one’s library; butthose who practice them know their value. With every new spiritual instruction Ireceived from Sri Yukteswarji he said, “You must know this truth.” And I did. Inthe beginning of my spiritual search in India I had steadfastly refused to joinany society because I didn’t find in them demonstrable truth. But when I foundmy Guru and this path, and saw through my own experience that it worked, I gavemy life to this cause.[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0022.html#footnote-104-backlink] Golden Lotus Temple formerly atEncinitas, California.2 [part0022.html#footnote-103-backlink] “O Arjuna! this is the ‘established inBrahman’ state.

He is real, and He can be found in this life. Inmen’s hearts there are many prayers—for money, fame, health—prayers for allmanner of things. But the prayer that should be first in every heart is theprayer for God’s presence. Silently and surely, as you walk on the path of life,you must come to the realization that God is the only object, the only goal thatwill satisfy you; for in God lies the answer to every desire of the heart.When you have found it impossible to fulfill some urgent wish by your owneffort, you turn to God in prayer. Thus every prayer that you utter represents adesire. But when you find God, all desires vanish, and there is no need forprayer. I don’t pray. That may seem a strange thing to say, but when the Objectof your prayer is with you all the time, you no longer have need to pray. Infulfillment of the wish or prayer for Him lies joy eternal.Material desires come through certain mistaken conceptions about the purpose oflife. This earth is not our home. The scriptures have told us we are children ofGod, made in His image, and that it is the will of the Divine that we return toour Source. What man does not realize is that unless and until he goes back tothe Source, back to God, he will have to struggle to fulfill endless desires.Reflect on that. Man cannot help having desires, and it is not a sin to havethem; but most human longings hamper fulfillment of the supreme desire to returnto God, hence they are detrimental to man’s happiness. Until he wants and hasGod, man will continue to long for whatever else he believes will make himhappy. But to him who has God, instant fulfillment of all desires comesautomatically.There are two classes of desires: those that help us to find God, and those thatobstruct our finding Him. For example, if someone hits you, you want toretaliate; but if you overcome that desire by using the superior power of love,you have applied the action that will help you to find God. All desires shouldbe satisfied in the divine way. When you try to satisfy them in the worldly way,you only multiply your difficulties. If you learn to give every desire to God,He will see to it that your good desires are fulfilled and the harmful ones areovercome. There is no protection greater than your conscience, and the divinequality of your good desires. If you but looked at your soul, the all-perfectreflection of God within you, you would find all your desires satisfied! In thatdivine consciousness, having which, no other gain is greater, you would beunmoved even if the whole world were given to you; neither would praise elateyou, nor blame hurt. You would feel only the great joy of God within.God’s Children Should Not BegAlways seek the guidance of the Divine in trying to fulfill your legitimatedesires, because that is the supreme way to receive the answers to all yourprayers. But one thing you must remember: cut out begging from your prayer!Change your old attitude of supplication. You should pray to God intimately, asHis child, which you are. God does not object when you pray from your ego,1[part0023.html#footnote-110] as a stranger and a beggar, but you will find thatyour efforts are limited by that consciousness. God does not want you to give upyour own will power, which is your divine birthright as His child.Naturally, one should distinguish between reasonable and unreasonable prayers ordesires. And bear in mind that, once you have made this discrimination, whatevergood or bad desires you hold on to are bound to be fulfilled. If you cling toany evil desires, they will be granted; and you will find out what harm andunhappiness they cause. As time goes on, you will realize that even though yourwish was fulfilled, your heart is still not satisfied; you will feel somethingwithin you rebelling. For example, suppose you have weak digestion, yet you wantto eat fried foods. Not surprisingly, you suffer every time you do. Although youfeel delight while fulfilling that desire, the aftereffect is pain; thus you aremade aware that you have done wrong. It is wiser to use discrimination toseparate your evil desires from your good ones and, having done so, to avoid thefulfillment of those wrong desires. Learn to be guided by your conscience, thedivine discriminative power within you.The Danger of Unfulfilled DesiresUnfulfilled desires remain in the heart. And what is the harm in harboring them?It is this: Every desire consists of specific forces, either good or evil, or amixture of both. And when you die, though your body is gone, those forces do notdie. As mental tabloids they follow your soul wherever it goes, and when you arereborn, these tabloids manifest as behavioral tendencies. Thus, a person who hasdied an alcoholic brings with him the tendency to alcoholism when he is reborn;and it remains with him until he overcomes desire for alcohol.The behavior of even the smallest child reveals certain characteristics of pastlives. Some children have terrible temper tantrums; others are moody. God didnot make them that way. Unfulfilled desires of past lives fashioned thosepsychological tendencies; and, because of them, the soul, even though made inthe image of God, appears as something different. If the image of God within youis distorted in this life by anger or fear, and you do not conquer suchuncharacteristic qualities now, you will be reborn with them; and you will havethe burden of these misery-creating tendencies until you overcome them in somefuture incarnation.It is better, therefore, to work out or overcome all your desires now. Theywould be finished immediately and for all time in the supreme joy of God’spresence; but until you know Him, your unconquered desires will remain to houndyou.There are two ways of finishing your desires—by realizing, through reason anddiscrimination, or wisdom, that only God can give permanent unalloyed happiness;and by fulfillment. In many cases desires lie hidden within the subconscious.You think they are finished, but they are not. Life is indeed a great mystery;but the mystery clears away when you dissect life with the scalpel of reason. Ifevery day you sit quietly for a little while and analyze yourself, you willdiscover that you have many unsatisfied desires. They are like dangerous germsthat you carry through life, and wherever you go, in this life or the next, theywill go with you.The best course is to do away with all dangerous desires in this life, bydiscrimination, and to concentrate on fulfilling your good desires. If you feeldrawn to commit suicide, or to do something evil, get rid of such desires now.Convince yourself, by reason and by good actions, that you are a child of God,made in His image, and rise above your moods and bodily habits. Be moredetached. In this way you will conquer. If you suffer from a chronic ailment,try mentally to separate yourself from the consciousness of the body. Bydiscrimination you can conquer the senses. Discrimination is the fire that burnsup desire.It is a general practice to store in the attic all of one’s unwanted,unnecessary “junk,” and once in a while to have a good housecleaning. Similarly,hidden away in the attic of your subconscious mind are many potentially harmfuldesires that one day may give you great trouble. It is important, therefore, toanalyze yourself. Perhaps you are a hateful or moody or angry type of person. Ifso, these stored traits are the result of your own past behavior. In order toclean out your mental attic of such unwanted furnishings, you must vigorouslyemploy constructive, positive, loving action.Love Thine EnemiesSuppose that even though an old enemy dies, you continue to feel hatred towardhim. In time that bitterness will produce ill effects in your own body and mind.It is better to concentrate on trying to behold God in your enemy; for by doingso you release yourself from evil vengeful desires that destroy your peace ofmind. By heaping hatred upon hatred, or giving hate in return for hate, you notonly increase your enemy’s hostility toward you; you poison your system,physically as well as emotionally, with your own venom.Conscience Will Tell You What You AreSometimes one feels a desire to “take it easy.” This is not wrong; to get awayfrom everything now and then gives a person a chance to think what life is allabout. Most people are floating along on the current of custom and fashion. Theyhave never actually lived their own life; they have lived the life of the world,and where has it gotten them? So it is wise now and then to remove yourself fromeveryday considerations; to calm your mind and try to understand what kind ofperson you are and what kind of person you want to be. And remember, the truesttestimony you can find is the testimony of your own conscience, thediscriminative voice of the soul. Whatever your conscience says, that is whatyou are. Think of the power of the conscience of Jesus. His accusers spat uponhim and crucified him and yet he said, “Father, forgive them.” That kind ofdiscrimination is the only power that will bring light on your path. Wheneverthere is an overwhelming desire in your heart to pray for a certain thing, useyour discrimination. Ask yourself, “Is it a good desire or a bad desire forwhich I seek fulfillment?”Man’s Lost Treasure Is GodThere are many influences that nourish desire in you. When you see a new modelcar, you want one. When you see a new model house, you want one. Some new styleof apparel comes out and immediately you yearn to wear that fashion. Whence dothese desires come? I used to sit for hours pondering this. Can you classify allyour desires? I sorted mine, and kept only the good ones; and when I had thecontact of God, I found all those good desires at once fulfilled. Today you wishfor one thing and tomorrow you hanker after something else. Your mind, havingdescended from almighty God, is not satisfied with the offerings of this world;and it will never be satisfied, because you have lost your soul’s richesttreasure, which alone can satisfy all your desires, and that is God.It is true there are some good and necessary desires, and you should strive tofulfill them. But never forget, while pursuing your little desires, to satisfyfirst your supreme desire—for God. Belief in the necessity of fulfilling lesserdesires and duties first is man’s greatest delusion. I well remember that duringmy training as a young disciple of my guru, Swami Sri Yukteswarji, I keptpromising myself daily, “I will meditate longer tomorrow.” A whole year slippedby before I realized that I was still putting it off. At once I made aresolution that first thing in the morning I would clean my body and thenmeditate long. But even then, as soon as I stirred about I became caught up inmy daily duties and activities. Thereupon I resolved to have my meditationfirst. Thus I learned a great lesson: First comes my duty to God, and then Itake care of all lesser duties. Why not? God says, “Why should I open the doorsof eternity to you, when you put other duties before Me?” If you are not soaringto the heights of Spirit, of what account are you? You have nothing to offer Godor man.So seek Him first. To give more importance to your earthly duties is falsereasoning, because at any moment the angel Gabriel may call you—at any momentyou may be taken away from here. Why then give so much importance to life? forlife is very peculiar. You think you are quite secure. Suddenly a loved onedies, or you lose your health, and all security vanishes. How I loved my motherand thought she would be with me always, and suddenly I found she was gone!2[part0023.html#footnote-109] Don’t be afraid of death, but be prepared for it.Life is not what it seems to be. Don’t trust it, for it is very tricky, and fullof disappointments. Perfection was not meant to be found here. I am not givingyou a false picture of life. This is not the kingdom of God; it is God’slaboratory, where He is testing souls to see if they will overcome evil desiresby good ones, and make Him their supreme desire, so they can return home to Hiskingdom.Take God, Not Life, SeriouslyLife is full of tragedy and comedy, a kaleidoscope of infinite variety. No twothings are the same. Everyone’s life is individual. Each person has a differentkind of face, a different kind of mind and desires. We would become bored if wehad exactly the same experiences every day; we would soon tire of life. Wereheaven itself the same every day, we wouldn’t want it. We enjoy variety. Thestereotyped conception of heaven is all wrong. If it were boring, all the saintswould pray to come back to earth for a little change! Heaven is somethinginfinitely different, ever pleasantly new, whereas earth is often unpleasantlynew!Yet, no matter how trying life is, most people become accustomed to it andassume there is no other way to live. Not being able to compare this life withthe spiritual life, they do not realize how painful and boring earthly livingis.Actually, life is not real; it is only an entertainment. And just as old moviesare shown over and over, so basically the same old incidents occur and recur inlife. And although life will go on eternally, the same themes depicted in pastfilms will be portrayed again and again. It is true that history repeats itself.We are all museum pieces!Whatever comes in life, just take it joyfully, impersonally, as you would amotion picture. Life is entertaining when we do not take it too seriously. Agood laugh is an excellent remedy for human ills. One of the bestcharacteristics of the American people is their ability to laugh. To be able tolaugh at life is marvelous. This my master [Swami Sri Yukteswar] taught me. Inthe beginning of my training in his hermitage, I went about with a solemn face,never smiling. One day Master pointedly remarked, “What is this? Are youattending a funeral ceremony? Don’t you know that finding God is the funeral ofall sorrows? Then why so glum? Don’t take this life too seriously.” He taught methat one must be mentally above every crucifixion of earthly experience in orderto find complete happiness in God.Krishna taught: “Evenminded during happiness and sorrow, profit and loss,triumph and failure—so encounter the battle of life! Thus thou wilt not acquiresin.”3 [part0023.html#footnote-108] To remain evenminded, no matter what comes,is one of the best ways to conquer delusive desires. This I learned from theexample of my great Master—even to the last, changeless. Christ alsodemonstrated that spirit. Even though Jesus was tortured, God’s love was nottaken away; he did not lose his divine consciousness. God’s protection of ourjoy and peace is the greatest fortress possible. Throughout all trials andsufferings, remember the good things that God has given you. Your soul is adivine temple of God. The darkness of mortal ignorance and limitations must bedriven out of that temple. It is wonderful to be in the consciousness of thesoul—fortified, strong!Be afraid of nothing. Hating none, giving love to all, feeling the love of God,seeing His presence in everyone, and having but one desire—for His constantpresence in the temple of your consciousness—that is the way to live in thisworld. Those who have other desires will not know true satisfaction.Environment Shapes Our DesiresDesires are formed according to one’s environment; they are created by, andtherefore limited by, your sense perceptions. Attending a country fair satisfiesa desire for a little excitement; but after you have been to a world fair andviewed all the different exhibits, a small fair no longer holds any attraction.This illustrates the importance of having communion with God now, for thecomparison with inferior earthly joys; then your desires will be of a muchhigher and more advanced nature. The desire to be one with God is the greatestof all. When you are through with any lesser desire, you soon pick up another,but when you have God, all other desires are satisfied completely. “Seek yefirst the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall beadded unto you.”4 [part0023.html#footnote-107] Why not fulfill first thishighest desire? for when He answers your prayer to know Him, all other desireswill be instantly fulfilled throughout eternity.Perhaps you feel that you have no desires. Well, I have often noticed whathappens when people go shopping. They may have no particular desire to buy, butsuddenly something catches their eye and they think, “I must have it!” Day andnight that object is on their mind, and finally they buy it, even if they haveto borrow the money. Then, after having it for a while, their happiness in itgrows stale, and they want something else. We meet people who say, “If only Icould have a thousand dollars (or a car, or a swimming pool),” and when thatwish is satisfied, they yearn for something different. Human desires are notperfect, hence their fulfillment does not lead to perfect happiness.The world environment will try to prevent you from remembering that the onlyworthwhile desire is to have God. But every day you should remind yourself ofthis. And when you have made up your mind not to smoke, or eat unwisely, or lieor cheat, be firm in these good desires; don’t weaken. Wrong environment sapsyour will and invites wrong desires. Live with thieves and you think that is theonly life. But live with divine persons, and after having divine communion, noother desires can tempt you. All become stale. Therefore even a few moments ofdeep meditation, or the company of a saint, will be a raft of inspiration tocarry you across this ocean of delusion to the shores of God.Be Safe in the Castle of God’s PresenceJoy lies in continually thinking of God. The longing for Him should be constant.A time comes when your mind never wanders away, when not even the greatestaffliction of body, mind, and soul can take your consciousness from the livingpresence of God. Is that not wonderful? to live and think and feel God all thetime? to remain in the castle of His presence, whence death nor aught else cantake you away? “On Me fix thy mind, be thou My devotee, with ceaseless worshipbow reverently before Me. Having thus united thyself to Me as thy Highest Goal,thou shalt be Mine own.”5 [part0023.html#footnote-106] When you are proofagainst all desires, you are enjoying the Presence Eternal.This life is strange. Everything is subject to change. That is why one shouldnot anchor his happiness on this life. Our time will pass on; what you areseeing now will be gone one day. Change is good if you don’t let it hurt you.When it does hurt, the rebellion you feel is meant to show you that you shouldnot have any desires. When you are anchored in that great Spirit you areenjoying everything, but without attachment. Therefore it is worthwhile to makethe effort to know Him. Otherwise life can horribly disillusion you.When I went back to India in 1935, I was looking forward to visiting some of theplaces I had enjoyed as a child, but upon my arrival I saw everything hadchanged. The stage was differently set. The greatest disillusionment came to mewhen I visited my old home in Ichapur, where I used to play and watch the birds.I was shocked. Only one remembered tree was left. That is the way life is; oneby one, things familiar and dear vanish from our sight. I would have givenanything then to have seen our home as it was in my childhood. Nevertheless Idid see it later, materialized in a vision; we swam in the pond, and I wentupstairs in the house and lay on the bed and ate mangoes, as I had done so manyyears before.Scrutinize your desires carefully now. Sort them and keep only good ones; andlet not even those good desires choke off the one important desire, for God.That must not be stifled. You are in great delusion when you ask God forfulfillment of your earthly desires and never ask Him to make a gift of Himselfto you. What would you think of a son who says, “Mother, write a check for me,”whenever he wants anything, but otherwise gives no thought to her? Don’t be likethat; never be ungrateful.When this book of life shall be closed, there will remain with you only therealization gained from those desires you have fulfilled in connection with God.So read from Whispers6 [part0023.html#footnote-105] and then meditate before yougo to bed each night. When you wake up, think of God. Pray not only beforetaking food, but when you are eating, and afterward. When you are working, weavethe thought of God around that activity. When you are in touch with God, youwill see all your desires mysteriously fulfilled. But you must seek Him first.He has given you everything; but only if you forsake all His gifts, preferringHim, will He surrender Himself. When you show God that you are willing tosacrifice everything to know Him, He will come to you.Carry a Portable Heaven WithinThe hardest obstacle to overcome is yourself. When you sit to meditate at night,your nervousness and restlessness are still with you. Learn to control your mindand body. Be king of yourself. Carry within you a portable heaven, and in lifeor in death, in heaven or in hades, that inner heaven will be with you. Praydeeply, sincerely, “O God, I yearn to know You. You must answer me!” and nextmorning pray again, “Lord, You must come to me!” and pray again the next nightin the same way, in the language of your heart; if you keep on, He must respond.But when you pray halfheartedly, while thinking in the back of your mind aboutsomething else, He knows He is not first with you, and He does not respond.Have God first. Have God now. Don’t wait, because delusion is very strong.Before you know it, the time will have come for you to quit this world. Wheneveryou have a moment, sit down and meditate. No matter how many times your prayershave not been answered, don’t worry; keep on praying. Pray with sincerity.Believe that your prayer is answered.In my life I have seen the most wonderful demonstrations of God’s response toprayer. I urge you to pray not for little things, but for His presence. Onlythat prayer is worthwhile. If you are willing to sacrifice an hour or two ofsleep for meditation every night, you will enter the kingdom of God. Don’t watchthe time. With deep sincerity pray, “Lord, I want You alone.” Bad habits andrestlessness will try to shake you from your effort, but keep your mind on Godand you will find His presence with you.Desires for worldly joys create the magnetic attraction that draws man back toearth, life after life. Reincarnation is no longer necessary for those who havefulfilled their desires in God. Whenever they want to fulfill any wish, theysimply think of that object and it is materialized before them. My motherappeared before me in flesh and blood, just as I see you here. How kind is God,how marvelous is God! that He materializes the objects of our desires to show usHis love and gratefulness when we have given Him first place in our hearts.To be able to demonstrate health or wealth or power or friends with God’s helpis fine, but if you can coax God Himself to respond to your prayers, you are aman of destiny. So don’t rest until you demonstrate God in your life. He willgive you everything you ever wished for; and He will test you. The tests in thespiritual life are greater than in any other. But you who pass His tests shallsay: “Lord, my greatest prayer has been answered. What else could my heart wantor need, but You?”[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0023.html#footnote-110-backlink] The ego consciousness; identificationwith the mortal body, which creates a feeling of separateness from God, andhence a feeling of limitation.2 [part0023.html#footnote-109-backlink] Paramahansa Yogananda was not yet elevenwhen his mother died.

But the glory of God is revealed only in the quietnessof the soul, in the intensity of the inner effort of the mind to commune withHim. It is there that we find truth. Outside, delusion is very strong; very fewpeople can get away from the influences of outer environment. The world goes onwith its infinite complexities and diverse experiences. Each life is new andeach life has to be lived differently. Yet underlying all life is the silentvoice of God, ever calling to us through flowers, through scriptures, andthrough our conscience—through all things that are beautiful and that make lifeworth living.The more you concentrate on the outside, the less you will know of the innerglory of the everlasting joy of Spirit. The more you concentrate within, theless you will have of difficulties without. But most people do not understandthis truth because of the influence of worldly company and environment, and badhabits. Environment keeps you more or less engrossed; it never allows you tothink of deeper realities. Even in this beautiful place in Encinitas I have seenthat some students came without the pure intention of seeking spiritualdevelopment. If you choose to see God you can see Him everywhere. Habits arepredatory; they destroy. You should learn to be happy with what you have. Don’twish for anything more than what is already coming to you. The Father knows whatyou need.The best way to be unendingly happy is to be conscious of the Father. Yourparamount desire should be God-realization; the determination to be with Himshould be supreme in your consciousness.I have given everything to God. There is nothing else that I can give anymore.And I have already realized that the only purpose of life is to know God. Manypeople may doubt that finding God is the purpose of life; but everyone canaccept the idea that the purpose of life is to find happiness. I say that God isHappiness. He is Bliss. He is Love. He is Joy that will never go away from yoursoul. So why shouldn’t you try to acquire that Happiness? No one else can giveit to you. You must continuously cultivate it yourself. The forces of nature areconstantly trying to give you the pleasures of the world, but such transitorysatisfactions only end in sorrow and bitterness. Even the most favored person,one who appears to have everything, may not be happy. And you will never besatisfied for long with earthly things. They give only a false peace andcontentment. The whole world has been plunged into chaos through greedy desires.Greed is creating war. Nothing else is causing it.He who conquers himself is the greatest victor in this battle of life. Money,fame, desires—everything that goes against this ideal is a detriment to ourpeace and happiness. If people would only learn to concentrate on the realvalues of life, they would find true happiness; but they are carried away byearthly desires. I find that no temptation can make me deviate from the path Ihave chosen. I could enthrall thousands with the powers God has given me, butthat course would be a detriment to me, and in any case I do not seek toenthrall thousands. I love to see true devotees—those who are anchored in God.Souls who love God will come here, and those whose enthusiasm will last to theend of life will find Him.God Must Come to Those Who Truly Want HimIt is impossible to deceive the Lord because He is sitting right behind yourthoughts, and knows what you are thinking and desiring. If in your heart youtruly renounce the world and seek inner communion with Him, He will come to you.But you must know that you want Him and nothing else. Once that desire for Himis established in your heart, He must come.The only thing to live for is the contact of the Divine, the communion with God.That is why Jesus said, “The harvest truly is plenteous but the laborers arefew.”1 [part0024.html#footnote-117] Believe the words of Jesus, who lived truth.Has there ever been a greater example of godliness for us than when he said,“Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do”?2[part0024.html#footnote-116]Everybody wants to have more money than the next person, and when he has it heis not satisfied, because he finds there is still someone else who has more thanhe. People live in a bedlam of misery, created by their own desires. Learn to besatisfied with what you have. The average person in America has much more thanthe average person in Europe or India, or in any other land. But still he is nothappy! He is burning with anxieties and worries.God’s way is the easiest way. It is best to go to the Father first and ask Himwhat is best for you. When you know that He is, and that He awaits you, whyshould you waste your time on lesser things? Have you ever tried sincerely tosee if the Father talks to you or not? The Lord is speaking to all human beings.What more can He do to attract your attention?I don’t want people to think that they can attain realization simply bylistening to others or by reading books. They must practice what they read andhear. It is better to go to church than to stay at home and listen to idlechatter, but even in church you must feel Him within, and you must know thetechnique by which you can realize His presence. Emotionalism andintellectualism cannot give realization.When you resign yourself completely to God, when you are never tempted to prayfor selfish ends, and when you are sure that God is your spirit, that He is yoursoul and everything else—then you are free.Think! A few decades hence, this existence of ours will have become a dream; andmy sitting here and talking with you will have become part of that dream. Allthe great masters of the past have become dreams in the consciousness ofmankind. But those great ones have attained. They are always conscious of whatis going on.What a dream this life is! And yet, when you look at your body now and see howit throbs with life, you become fully convinced again of the reality of thisdream. You think you must have this or that and then you can be happy. But nomatter how many of your desires are satisfied, you will never find happinessthrough them. The more you have, the more you want. Learn to live simply. “Hismind is full with contentment whose desires ever flow inward. That man is like achangeless ocean which is kept brimful with constantly entering waters. He isnot a muni who bores holes of desires in his reservoir of peace and lets thewaters escape.”3 [part0024.html#footnote-115]Seek God in SolitudeYou need to be guided by those who know God, those who commune with Him. Jesustaught us to seek God in solitude.4 [part0024.html#footnote-114] In the solitudeof inner silence you learn about the Holy Ghost. The great masters of India alsospeak of this divine power. The true meaning of the Holy Ghost has first come inthis land through Self-Realization Fellowship. Everything in creation isvibration, which is guided by the intelligence of God. That intelligentvibration is the Holy Ghost.5 [part0024.html#footnote-113] Everyone should learnhow to contact the Holy Ghost through meditation; Self-Realization teaches youhow.In the silence of your soul, in the bower of your concentration, the romancewith the Infinite is endless. But you cannot have God and mammon6[part0024.html#footnote-112] together. You must give yourself to God wholly. Heis the Eternal Lover, and He is begging for the love of you all.You must learn to use your will and concentration in order to seek Godwholeheartedly. Your actions are dictated by your habits. You are always beingforced by habits to do things that you don’t want to do. You are your own enemyand you don’t know it. You don’t learn to sit quietly. You don’t learn to givetime to God. And you are impatient and expect to attain heaven all at once. Youcannot get it by reading books or by listening to sermons or by doing charitableworks. You can get God only by giving your time to Him in deep meditation.Look to God AloneYou must make the effort to please God first. It is impossible to please all. Itry never to displease anybody. I do my best and that is all I can do. My firstaim is to please God. I use my hands to pray in adoration before Him, my feet toseek Him everywhere, my mind to think of Him as always present. Every throne ofthought must be occupied by God—God as peace, God as love, God as kindness, Godas understanding, God as compassion, God as wisdom. This is the only thing thatI have come to tell you. Naught else.Learn the Self-Realization technique of meditation. Keep good company. Don’tlook to others, but to God alone. And every day speak of this work to others.Every day do good to some people. As long as there is money in my pocket I nevercease to give. My bank is God.Last of all, you must know God, just as the great ones know Him. If you followthe technique, you will find Him through your own efforts.One day I was walking outside the hermitage, thinking of my great guru, SriYukteswarji, and wondering about him. I felt sad that I was enjoying thisbeautiful ashram and that he could not be here to share it with me. Suddenly heappeared to me in the sky and said, “You think you are the only one enjoyingthis place! I am enjoying it from all space.”You must strive to be one with God. Practice meditation every day and learn tolove Him deeply, and to love your neighbors as yourself. This is the only way toavoid war. There must be spiritual cooperation. Without spirituality therecannot be happiness, either national or individual. And happiness must startwith the individual. God-communion is the only answer to all problems, whetherthey be physical, financial, matrimonial, moral, or spiritual.Happiness comes by feeling that you are one with God—that you are the child ofGod—a prince child of the King of the Universe. You are not a beggar child. Youhave jailed yourself in the body because of ignorance of your Father. You mustfree yourself from this jail. You must keep your mind riveted to God no matterwhat comes. Then you will find great peace and joy. “Their thoughts fully on Me,their beings surrendered to Me, enlightening one another, proclaiming Me always,My devotees are contented and joyful.”7 [part0024.html#footnote-111][../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0024.html#footnote-117-backlink] Matthew 9:37.2 [part0024.html#footnote-116-backlink] Luke 23:34.3 [part0024.html#footnote-115-backlink] Bhagavad Gita II:70.

Someare never liked. Others are neither liked nor disliked; they are just ignored.Why? Impartial God is not responsible for the uneven distribution of attractivequalities. The differences in each man’s character are of his own cultivation.He himself has created those pleasant or unpleasant qualities, in this or inpast lives. It would be a great injustice if God were responsible for startingoff some children with the advantage of likable good qualities and others with ahandicap of obnoxious bad qualities. But it is not He who has established badtendencies in some children and good in others; therefore we cannot hold Godaccountable.God creates all men equal, made in His image. In order to see the justificationof man’s seeming inequalities, we must understand the law of reincarnation.Knowledge of this law was buried and forgotten during the Dark Ages. Jesus spokeof reincarnation when he said: “Elias is come already, and they knew himnot....Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John theBaptist.”1 [part0025_split_000.html#footnote-122] The soul appearing in oneincarnation as Elias (Elijah) had returned in another incarnation as John theBaptist.There would be no meaning to life if it did not afford us sufficientopportunities to develop our potentials and satisfy our desires. Withoutreincarnation, how does the divine justice operate for those souls who have nochance to express themselves because they are encased in the body of a baby thatis born dead, or of one that perhaps lives only to the age of six? Those soulscould hardly be condemned to Hades, because they have done nothing to deservepunishment; nor could they go to Heaven, having had no opportunity to earn it.The answer is that this earth is a vast schoolhouse, and the law ofreincarnation is the justice that brings each man here again and again until hehas learned all of life’s lessons. Lord Krishna referred to this truth: “Bydiligently following his path, the yogi, perfected by the efforts of manybirths, is purged of sin (karmic taint) and finally enters the SupremeBeatitude.”2 [part0025_split_000.html#footnote-121]Man himself has cultivated his bright and dark qualities. Somewhere, sometime,in this or other lives, the seeds were planted by his own actions. If he permitsthe seeds of harmful acts to grow, they will crowd out the seeds of good that hehas sown. The wise cast out the seeds of evil from the garden of life.Attractiveness Comes From WithinOne should learn to analyze himself and others to determine why some persons areliked by all and others are not. Even among children we find some whom everyoneregards affectionately and others whom everyone avoids. One of the firstconclusions from such analysis is that if a person is to become likable, he mustmake himself more attractive from within. Sometimes even the most physicallyattractive person may be repellent because of the inner ugliness reflected inhis speech and actions.At one time the secret of popularity was supposed to be “it,” a kind of physicalappeal and magnetism. But having “it” does not necessarily make one likable. Ourgood or bad traits determine whether, and by whom, we are liked or disliked.Evil attracts evil; good attracts good. “It” is not what we should want, but thekind of magnetism that will draw good to us, that will bring sincere friends andmerited admiration. Can externals such as clothes and a pretty or handsome facegive us this kind of attractiveness? No. It has to be created within.Avoid moodiness. There is no unpleasantness in being grave; but your expressionis quite different when you are indulging in a dark mood. Your face is a mirrorthat reveals every change of feeling. Your thoughts and emotions, like waves,ebb and flow in the facial muscles, continuously altering your appearance.Everyone you meet sees and reacts to these facial expressions of what you areinwardly thinking and feeling. You can fairly well control your eyes and yoursmile, and thus conceal your feelings from some; but not from all. Lincolnrightly said, “It is true that you may fool all the people some of the time; youcan even fool some of the people all the time; but you can’t fool all of thepeople all the time.”In our eyes is the entire history of our life. It cannot be concealed from thosewho know how to read it. There are spiritual eyes, half-spiritual eyes,dishonest eyes, sensual eyes. What one does is written there. If I were toanalyze what I see in a person’s eyes, he would be astonished at my accuracy.Never do anything that taints your mind. Wrong actions cause negative or evilmental vibrations that are reflected in your whole appearance and personality.Engage in those actions and thoughts that nurture the good qualities you want tohave. If you conduct yourself in accord with the truths I am telling you, youwill find your life beautifully different.You Are Judged Largely by the Way You Conduct YourselfOne is judged somewhat by his dress, but largely by the way he conducts himself.Always be clean and trim in appearance. Avoid overdressing: fussy clothes andaccessories make one look like a museum piece! Clothe yourself simply andneatly, and as befits your personality. But first of all learn good behavior.Once you have developed your mind and cultivated appealing inner virtues, dressbecomes less important.Mahatma Gandhi has proved that clothes alone do not “make the man.” He wears3[part0025_split_000.html#footnote-120] only a loincloth, by way of identifyinghimself with the simple masses of India. There he once arrived thus clad for aparty that was being given by an English governor. The servants would not lethim in. He returned home and sent a package by messenger to the governor. Itcontained a suit. The governor called him at his home and asked the meaning ofthe package. The great man replied: “I was invited to your party, but I wasn’tallowed entrance because of my dress; therefore I have sent my suit instead.”The governor of course insisted that he come. Even in London Gandhi went to callon the King and Queen of England clad only in his loincloth. He had transcendedthe clothes personality. Now I am not recommending this mode of dress! Gandhihas a mission to fulfill, and this is a part of his role. If one becomes asgreat as Gandhi, he also may do as he sees fit.The point is, one should not think all the time about the body; nor should he becareless of it. To give the body too little or too much attention makes onebecome unbalanced, fanatical. Look after the body in a reasonable way, andremember always what is most important—your mentality, your behavior. Give moreattention to the mind, the springboard of your behavior, for that is what mostpersons respond to.When With Others, Be Sincere and ThoughtfulBe interested in others. When you are by yourself you have a right to think anddo what you want to; but when you are with others, you should not beabsentminded or uninterested. The company of a corpse would be preferable tothat of an absentminded person; the indifference of a corpse bears no insult.When you are in the company of others, be with them wholeheartedly; but whenyour interest in being with them lags, make a polite excuse and withdraw. Youhave no right to remain while your mind is absent.Be genuinely amiable when you are with others. Never be a “sourpuss.” You don’thave to laugh boisterously, like a hyena, but don’t wear a long face either.Just be smiling, congenial, and kind. Smiling on the outside when you are angryor resentful inside, however, is hypocrisy. If you want to be likable, besincere. Sincerity is a soul quality that God has given to every human being,but not all express it. Above all, be humble. Though you may have admirableinner strength, don’t overwhelm others with your strong nature. Be calm andconsiderate of them. This is the way to develop likable magnetism.Strive always to be understanding. Some people choose to be quarrelsome and tomisunderstand us no matter what we say or do. They go about with a chip on theirshoulder. To draw real friends, one must cultivate understanding. True friendsunderstand one another no matter what they do. You should be like that.What is life unless you have the right kind of friends around you? There is amagnet in your heart that will attract true friends. That magnet isunselfishness, thinking of others first. Very few persons are free fromself-centeredness. Yet one can develop the quality of unselfishness very easilyif he practices thinking of others first. A mother usually has this quality. Herlife is service. She gives to her husband and children first. Because she alwaysthinks of others before herself, others think of her. That is the tradition inthe homes in India. We are taught the same spirit in the ashrams of realspiritual teachers.Consideration for others is a most wonderful quality. It is the greatestattractiveness you can have. Practice it! If someone is thirsty, a thoughtfulperson anticipates his need and offers him a drink. Consideration meansawareness of and attentiveness to others. A considerate person, when in thecompany of others, will have an intuitive awareness of their needs.Live for Others and They Will Live for YouThere are those who would say, “I am a devout man.” Yet if someone else sat intheir church pew they would be ready to take off the intruder’s head! Once in awhile I see this sort of incident in my classes. If another person wants yourseat, give it, even though you must stand. By your exemplary behavior you willhave someone else thinking considerately of you every day. When you learn tolive for others, they will live for you. When you live for yourself, no one isinterested in you. You can best attract others by your good actions.If you look around you, when you attend a party; you will almost always noticesome guests who are openly envious of what others have. No one wants to be withthoughtless, selfish people. But everyone is glad to be with a tactful,considerate person.Practice consideration in your speech as well as in your actions; and when youfeel tempted to speak harshly, control that impulse and talk calmly instead. Letno one hear harsh words from you. Be not afraid to speak truth when you areasked to do so; but do not force your thoughts on others. Remember also, it maybe truth to speak of the blind man as a blind man, or the sick man as a sickman, but it is better to avoid such bluntness. By the kindness and considerationof your speech you help to uplift others and make them better.It isn’t always your words that others listen to, however, but the strength andsincerity behind them. When a sincere man speaks, the world moves. When he sayssomething, others listen. Some persons talk on and on, hoping to convince thehearer by the steady barrage of words. But the captive listener is onlythinking, “Please let me go!” When you talk, don’t talk too much about yourself.Try to speak on a subject that interests the other person. And listen. That isthe way to be attractive. You will see how your presence is in demand.My mother was considerate in that way. Fathers and mothers should never talkagainst one another to the children. They should keep their troubles completelyto themselves. My parents had that self-control; they were really like gods.Only once did I see trouble between my father and mother. All that we childrenknew was that a carriage was at the door and our mother was going away. Unclecame in and asked Father, “What is the matter?” Father said, “I have noobjection to her spending money for her charities; I only ask that she not spendbeyond my income.” Uncle whispered something in Father’s ear. After a fewconciliatory words from Father, Mother sent the carriage away. She never said aword against Father. She was always thinking of others.It is a joy to live for others. When I am alone I have hardly any impulse toeat, but when I am with others I like to fix appetizing dishes for them. I sawthat same characteristic in my guru, Swami Sri Yukteswarji. During my firstvisits to his ashram, I gained the impression that he always had savory food toeat. But once I went there when he didn’t expect me, and I saw he was having theplainest meal imaginable. I questioned him about it. “I don’t have specialdishes except when you come,” he replied. “I like to prepare them for you.”Once a fellow college student accompanied me to the market to buy somepineapples. There were only two; one was larger than the other. I bought both ofthem and handed the large one to my friend. He was so surprised! He thought Ihad intended to keep that one for myself. A wonderful feeling arises within aperson when he is considerate of others, thinking first of them. As soon as youare concerned for someone else, not only does he think of you, but God thinks ofyou too. If you are thoughtful, doing for others all the time, then even if youpart with your last penny to help them, God will return even more blessings toyou.Another thing to remember: Each one of you has some special quality, auniqueness, that others have not. Also, each one is richer or poorer in some waythan others are. If you are unselfish, good-tempered, understanding, you arericher than those who are selfish and angry and jealous.Perfect Balance Is the Altar of GodMankind is like a large zoo—so many people behaving so differently, most of themhaving no real control over themselves. But before one can realize the true Goalof life, he has to have that self-control. He must seek balance. Perfect balanceis the altar of God. Strive for this; and once you have attained it, never loseit. Christ did not lose it when he was being nailed to the cross. He said,“Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.” The ordinary personcannot bear his tests.When I started on the spiritual path I supposed that only good would happen tome; but I found that many difficult experiences also came. Then I reasoned:“Because I love God so deeply, I have expected too much from Him. From now on Iwill say, ‘Lord, let Thy will be done.’” Severe trials came. But I held to thethought, “Let Thy will be done.” I wanted to accept whatever He sent my way. AndHe always showed me how to be victorious in every test.Even death is nothing to the spiritually strong. I once dreamed I was dying.Nevertheless I was praying to Him: “Lord it is all right; whatever is Thy will.”Then He touched me and I realized the truth: “How can I die? The wave cannotdie; it sinks back into the ocean and comes forth again. The wave never dies;and I can never die.”When you go to a clothing store, you try to find a garment that is suited toyou, that brings out the best in you. You should do the same for your soul. Thesoul has no particular apparel; it can don any style it wants to. The body islimited, but the soul can put on any kind of mental dress, any kind ofpersonality.If you think deeply about any person, study his history, and consciously imitatehis personality, you will begin to be like him; you will establish your identitywith that personality. I have practiced this, and I can take on any personalityI wish. When I put on the personality of wisdom I can talk of nothing butwisdom. When I adopt the personality of Sri Chaitanya,4[part0025_split_000.html#footnote-119] a great devotee of God, I can speak ofnothing but devotion. And when I attune myself to the personality of Jesus, Icannot speak of God as Mother—only as the Father, as he did. The soul can adoptany mental dress it admires or desires, and change that dress as often as itpleases.When you meet a wonderful person, don’t you wish you were like him? Think of allthe noble qualities that are in the hearts of great men and women; you can havethem all in your own heart. You can be humble and strong, or brave like ageneral fighting for a righteous cause. You can have the conquering will ofGenghis Khan or the divine will and love and surrender of St. Francis.Seek God, and Be Victorious in LifeAbove all, develop the will to seek God, no matter what the obstacles. Then youwill be victorious in life. When I am trying to do something for the work, andmany trials come, I sometimes think: “Why should I have to go through this? Ihave found God. I don’t need these things for myself.”5[part0025_split_000.html#footnote-118] But then I tell Him: “I will acceptwhatever comes to me. I care not what people think of me, because one day theyare with me, the next day they are against me. Your pleasure is my pleasure.Your assurance is my assurance.”Emulate the consciousness of the great ones such as Christ. Realize hisomnipresence. The Father gave Jesus that universal consciousness by which heknows all things. Even as I am talking, he knows what I am saying. Though youdon’t see him, I see him. He is right here—a great light, transforming thistemple. Everyone here is within that light which I see. We are like waves in theocean of that light—the light of Christ Consciousness, the light of God. Whenyou see His light and His presence, then you know that this life is nothing morethan a test that everyone must go through to reach God. If Satan’s tests areconquered, then even Satan becomes the tool of God. Every trial is a blessing ifit brings us nearer to God. This is what you should remember. And whatever youdo on earth, do it for God.Each human being is unique; no two can be exactly the same. Think of yourselfthis way: “My personality is the gift of God. What I am, no one else is. I shallbe very proud of my divine individuality. I shall improve myself and don apersonality of goodness.” If you play your part well, you are just as good asthe soul who plays the part of a king or queen. And so long as you play yourpart well, you will be attractive and loved by all. Your part well played isyour passport to God.Abraham Lincoln was an accomplished actor on this stage of life. He was notafraid to play his difficult role. He was working for God and for what hebelieved to be right: the equality of man. That is why he is remembered andloved today. If you strive to serve God, you have served everyone. Seek toplease Him, not man.What you expect others to be, you be first. Practice these suggestions. Take onequality at a time and work at developing it. From today, for instance, practicepeace. Then take cheerfulness; try to smile even when you are unhappy. Then workat cultivating courage and fearlessness. Some persons are terrified of the dark.If you are one of these, practice going into a dark room until you get over thisfear. Develop the consciousness that God is with you. You can be in animpregnable castle and still disease can get at you there. Yet you can be on thebattlefield with bullets flying all around you, and if your time to leave thebody has not come, nothing will hurt you. Practice perfecting sincerity,unselfishness, business ability, and so on. Work at it like the strong-mindedmartyr who never compromises his ideals. No matter what comes, do not let itbother or deter you. Be like that.Practice consideration and goodness until you are like a beautiful flower thateveryone loves to see. Be the beauty that is in a flower, and the attractivenessthat is in a pure mind. When you are attractive in that way, you will alwayshave true friends. You will be loved by both man and God.[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0025_split_000.html#footnote-122-backlink] Matthew 17:12–13.2 [part0025_split_000.html#footnote-121-backlink] Bhagavad Gita VI:45.3 [part0025_split_000.html#footnote-120-backlink] Gandhi was still living whenParamahansaji gave this talk.

The real nature of personality is rarely analyzed.What, essentially, is personality? It is the ego consciousness; not ego in thesense of inflated pride, but as the consciousness of existence. Each one of usknows: “I exist.”Further, we are conscious of existing in a certain way, as a man or a woman, andwith certain characteristic qualities. We think about ourselves in terms of ourindividual background, experiences, and environment. A housekeeper thinks ofherself as a housekeeper, a lecturer thinks of himself as a lecturer, ascientist thinks of himself as a scientist. Yet when they are asleep they forgettheir daytime activities. In sleep the consciousness of existence remains,though the egoistic concept of the wakeful personality may fade away entirely.But as soon as one awakens he remembers and becomes reassociated with hisenvironmental identity. Therefore the personality a man displays in his wakefulhours is merely a cultivated and partial individuality.The consciousness of existence is fundamentally a universal, unlimited state;but it becomes more or less bound by the personality traits that we hold to fromday to day. Eventually we forget that our individual qualities can be expandedor contracted, according to our behavior.Whence does our true personality derive? It comes from God. He is AbsoluteConsciousness, Absolute Existence, and Absolute Bliss. The Creator knows that Heexists; He also knows that His existence is eternal, and that His nature is evernew Bliss.With the human mind we cannot know the Infinite Mind or perceive what ineffableSpirit is; but through the superconsciousness of the soul we can taste theDivine Presence as Bliss. The joy we receive from any experience flows from God,even though it may have been roused by some outward circumstance.By concentrating within, you can directly feel the divine bliss of your soulwithin and also without. If you can stabilize yourself in that consciousness,your outer personality will develop and become attractive to all beings. Thesoul is made in God’s image, and when we become established in soul awareness,our personality begins to reflect His goodness and beauty. That is your realpersonality. Any other characteristics you display are more or less a graft—theyare not the real “you.” The divine man, living in the cosmic consciousness ofGod, can assume any kind of outer personality he wishes.When I am conscious of my human personality I have limitations, but as soon as Ichange my consciousness to the soul sphere I see everything just as if it were amotion picture. A person concentrating on the beam by which images are shown ona movie screen can see that all those figures are scintillating by the currentof light emanating from the projector. In the same way, I see the world and allits creatures solely as the projected thoughts of God. Concentrate on matter andyou see everything in terms of matter. But as soon as you lift up yourconsciousness to the state of divine awareness, you see the oceanic current ofGod’s light flowing behind all matter. You see everything in terms of Spirit.Though the unity of God is reflected in everything, it appears diversified incosmic nature. His creative life flows throughout the earth; put a seed in theground and it begins to grow. Metals express a certain power and beauty of God.In the vegetable kingdom He changes His personality again; the active expressionof life is more visible in plants. Still, a study of creation reveals that everymetal, every plant, every animal has a distinctive personality; and in man wefind an even more expanded individuality, for man knows that he is a living,conscious being. But all these different personalities have been borrowed fromGod; He is the only Life. “O Arjuna! I am the Self in the heart of allcreatures: I am their Origin, Existence, and Finality.” Thus the Lord describesHimself in the Gita.1 [part0026.html#footnote-126] And in the Bible we read Hisdeclaration: “I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith theLord, which is and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.”2[part0026.html#footnote-125]Intuition Develops One’s True PersonalityOur soul intuition is a faculty of God. He has no mouth, yet He tasteseverything. He has no hands or feet, yet He feels the whole universe. How? Byintuition, by His omnipresence.Man ordinarily relies upon his senses to supply him with information abouthimself and the world in which he lives. His mind doesn’t know anything exceptwhat his five senses tell him. But the superman relies upon intuition, his“sixth sense,” for knowledge. Intuition doesn’t depend on the senses or thepower of inference for its data. For example, you feel certain that something isgoing to happen, and it does happen, exactly as you foresaw it. Each one of youhas probably had some such experience. How did you know without any inferentialor sense data? That direct knowing is the soul’s power of intuition.The ancient Indian sage Patanjali tells us that scriptural authority is not initself proof of truth. How then can you know that the Bible and the Gita aretrue? The data relayed by the senses and the power of inference cannot givefinal proof. Truth is ultimately understood or “proved” solely by intuition,soul realization.Your true personality begins to develop when you are able, by deep intuition, tofeel that you are not this solid body but are the divine eternal current of Lifeand Consciousness within the body. That is how Jesus could walk on the water. Herealized that everything is composed of the consciousness of God.Human personality can be changed to divine personality. Banish the consciousnessthat you are a bundle of flesh and bones. Every night God makes you forget thatdelusion. But as soon as you wake up you are back again in the seemingconfinements of the body.Man Can Be Whatever He Wants to BeMan can change his outer and inner nature by concentration. A person of strongmind can be whatever he wants to be. The limited human personality can begreatly expanded by meditation. When you close your eyes and feel the vastnessof the soul within you, and when you can make that consciousness enduring, thenyou will have the personality that God intended you should have. The experienceof the wakeful state has become predominant in your consciousness. But at thetime of deep sleep, when man is granted freedom from the limitations of theflesh, you are in touch with Truth, with your real personality. Your attitudechanges with the subconscious and superconscious realization: “I am infinite. Iam a part of everything.”As your consciousness expands with divine understanding, your personalitybecomes increasingly attractive and powerful. When your character grows in aspiritual way, you can assume almost any shade of personality you desire. Mindis illimitable; and as you develop spiritually and your inner life becomesseparate from body consciousness, you no longer feel any egoistic attachment tothe flesh; you are aware of ineffable freedom.You shouldn’t identify yourself as any particular type of individual. Rather beable to change your personality whenever you want to. I have done many differentthings in my life, just for the fun of it. I have invested money, I have donethe work of a musician, of a contractor, of a cook. Truly, you can accomplishanything if you do not accept limitations by identifying yourself with yourpresent personality. When you say to me that you can’t do this or that, I don’tbelieve it. Whatever you make up your mind to do, you can do. God is the sumtotal of everything, and His image is within you. He can do anything, and so canyou, if you learn to identify yourself with His inexhaustible nature.No matter if you have health and wealth and everything else you want of theworld, still there will always be some disillusion that will bring grief.Nothing of the earth is lasting; only God is lasting. When you develop theindividuality that is an expression of His presence within you, which is yourtrue Self, you will be able to attract anything you want. Any other personalityyou try to develop—whether that of an artist or a businessman or a writer—willbring disenchantment in its wake, because all human expressions have theirlimitations. You may go after success or money or fame, and achieve it; butalways some flaw—lack of health or insufficient love or something else—will hurtyou. The best course is to pray: “Lord, make me happy with awareness of Thee.Give me freedom from all earthly desires, and above all give me Thy joy thatoutlasts all the happy and sad experiences of life.”Never Forget Your True Nature!Remember that as a child of God you are endowed with greater strength than youwill ever need to overcome all the trials that God may send you.Often we continue to suffer without making an effort to change; that is why wedon’t find lasting peace and contentment. If we would persevere we wouldcertainly be able to conquer all difficulties. We must make the effort, that wemay go from misery to happiness, from despondency to courage.It is necessary first to feel the importance of changing our condition. Thisattitude stimulates our will to action. Let us resolve that we will always makean effort to improve our Self-knowledge and thus continuously better ourexistence.India’s spiritual scientists explored the kingdom of the soul. They have givento mankind for its benefit certain universal laws of meditation by which realseekers—those who wish to find a good life by changing themselves—mayscientifically control their minds and attain Self-realization.When you develop your divine nature you become completely detached about thebody; you no longer feel identified with it. You look after it as you wouldattend to a little child. As you realize your true Self more and more, bymeditation, you become freed from mental and physical pains. You cast off yourlifelong limitations. That is the best way to live out your days on earth.Awaken Your Divine PersonalityRemember that it is not harmful to own things, but it is harmful to be owned bythem. It is difficult to have the right balance. Struggling too hard for money,you may neglect your health. You will find that everything will betray you ifyou betray your loyalty to God. So let not one drop of oil fall from the lamp ofyour attention in the sanctuary of inner silence as you meditate each day, andas you carefully perform your duties in the world.3 [part0026.html#footnote-124]That is the personality you want to develop—dutiful in carrying out yourobligations in life, but aware that your real Home lies within. What is the useof developing a personality based on worldly values, which are ever changefuland fleeting? Rather strive for a personality that is derived from your livingin the continuous consciousness of God. Bhagavan Krishna said: “When a mancompletely relinquishes all desires of the mind, and is entirely contented inthe Self, by the Self, he is then considered to be one settled in wisdom.”4[part0026.html#footnote-123]Awaken that meek yet thunderous divine personality—strong as the lion, gentle asthe dove. When you make up your mind that you will meditate and follow thispath, nothing will be able to take you away from it. Perform your worldly tasksfaithfully, without forgetting for a moment your highest duty, to God.[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0026.html#footnote-126-backlink] Bhagavad Gita X:20.2 [part0026.html#footnote-125-backlink] Revelation 1:8.3 [part0026.html#footnote-124-backlink] A story oft-related in India tells ofthe spiritual test given by the great saint, King Janaka, to his would-bedisciple, Sukadeva. To test the young devotee before accepting him for spiritualtraining, Janaka required Sukadeva to tour the royal palace while carrying inthe palm of his hand an oil lamp filled to the brim. The condition of passingthe test was that Sukadeva was to observe minutely (and subsequently report tothe King) every item and detail in each palatial room, without spilling one dropof oil from the brimful lamp. The meaning of the test is that the spiritualaspirant must learn to keep his attention centered in God, not allowing histhoughts to wander from Him for a moment, lest the oil of divine communion bespilled, while at the same time he performs accurately to the last detail hisduties in the world.4 [part0026.html#footnote-123-backlink] Bhagavad Gita II:55."},{"pageContent":"The Divine Art of Making FriendsFirst Self-Realization Fellowship Temple at Encinitas, California, January 22,1939Friendship is the noblest human expression of God’s desire to show His love toman. God showers affection on the baby through the father and mother; theirfeeling for the infant is inborn, because our Creator has ordained that ourparents can’t help but love us. But friendship comes to us as a free, impartialexpression of His love.1 [part0027.html#footnote-131]Two strangers meet, and by an instantaneous choice of their hearts they wish tohelp each other. Have you ever analyzed how this happens? The spontaneous mutualdesire to be friends comes directly from God’s divine law of attraction;cumulative mutual acts of friendship between two souls in past lives graduallycreate a karmic bond that irresistibly attracts them to each other in this life.So long as it is uncontaminated by selfishness or attraction to the oppositesex, this impulse is pure. But often it is tainted. Friendship grows on the treeof our innermost feelings; it is desecrated by unwholesome desires and selfishactions. If you put the wrong kind of fertilizer on the roots of a tree, thefruit that develops will be poor; and when you feed the tree of human feelingwith the emotion of selfishness, your unworthy motives will blemish the fruit offriendship. To feel interested in someone just because he is rich or influentialand can do something for you is not friendship. And to be attracted to someoneprimarily because that person has a beautiful face is not friendship. When thatface loses its youthful attractiveness, the “friendship” will evaporate.Develop Friendships From the PastIt is true that you cannot find friendship everywhere. Some persons you seeevery day and never know, and others you feel you have known always. You shouldlearn to recognize that inner cue. Wherever you are, always keep your eyes open,and if you feel divinely attracted to someone, you should develop friendshipwith that person because he has been your friend in some life before. There aremany friends whom we have known in past lives, but those friendships have notyet been perfected. It is better to start building on a foundation that hasalready been laid than to dig for a foundation on the sands of temporaryacquaintances. It is easy for one to think he has many friends, until they dosomething hurtful to him, and then he feels deeply disillusioned.Many people make mistakes in choosing friends because they are deluded by outerappearances. The only way to recognize real friends is to meditate more. Youshould try to find friends the divine way, and that is to purge yourconsciousness of all thought of facial or other appearances as factors indetermining your feelings about others. If you do this, one day you will be ableto discover true friends all around you. You will feel God’s friendship throughthose humble human channels that do not resist Him. Through the pure of heartthe divine light of friendship will flow to you.To Attract Friends, Improve Your CharacterYou cannot attract true friends without removing from your own character thestains of selfishness and other unlovely qualities. The greatest art of makingfriends is to behave divinely yourself—to be spiritual, to be pure, to beunselfish—and to start friendship where the foundation of friendship has alreadybeen laid in a past life.Friendship should exist in all human relations: between parents and children,between husbands and wives, between men and men, between women and women, andbetween men and women. It is unconditional. When you have the impulse tobefriend others, it is the presence of God that you feel. Friendship is a divineimpulse. God is not satisfied to look after His human children only in the guiseof parents and other relatives. He comes as friends to give us opportunities toexpress unconditional love from our hearts.The more your human shortcomings drop away and divine qualities come into yourlife, the more friends you will have. Was not Lord Jesus a great friend to all,and Lord Buddha, and Lord Krishna? To be like them you must perfect your lovefor others. When you can convince others of your friendship; when you are sure,through the tests of time and many shared experiences, that a person reallyfeels for you from the soul, and you feel for that person in the same way—notfor any gain, but solely because of the divine impulse of friendship—you willbehold in that relationship the reflection of God.Give Friendship to All, As God DoesDo not allow your friendship to remain locked up in one person, but graduallyestablish this divine relationship with others of noble ideals. If you try tobuild friendship with a wrong-minded person you will be disillusioned. Befriends first with the truly good, then go on being a friend to others until youcan feel friendship toward everyone, until you can say: “I am a friend to all,even my enemies.” Even toward those who were crucifying him, Jesus felt onlyfriendship, exemplifying in his final ordeal that which he had always taught:“...Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you,and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.”2[part0027.html#footnote-130]True friendship is divine love, for it is unconditional and it is real andlasting. Emerson beautifully expressed this ideal in one of his essays:3[part0027.html#footnote-129] “The highest compact we can make with our fellowis—‘Let there be truth between us two forevermore.’ ...It is sublime to feel andsay of another, I need never meet or speak or write to him, we need notreinforce ourselves or send tokens of remembrance; I rely on him as on myself,if he did thus or thus, I know it was right.” You can talk freely with a friendwithout being misunderstood. But friendship can never develop if there is anyhint of demand of one on the other. Friendship can be built only on a basis offreedom and spiritual equality. Therefore you should treat everyone in thatdivine light, in the consciousness that each person is an image of God. If youmistreat someone you will never know friendship with him.Many people go through life without friends. I can’t imagine how they are ableto carry on. Real friends seldom misunderstand us, and if they do it is only fora little while. Should someone abuse your trust, go on giving love andunderstanding just the same, as you would hope to receive it. But if that personcontinues to behave spitefully, and goes on slapping the extended hand offriendship, then it is better to withhold your hand for a time.Universal Friendship Starts at HomeFriendship should start at home. If in your family there is one who isparticularly in harmony with you, develop friendship with that person first.Then, if you feel drawn to someone of similar ideals among your acquaintances,develop that relationship. Banish all desires born of selfishness or sexcompulsion. In giving pure friendship you will see the guidance of God. Developfriendship with good people, and the more you meditate the more you willrecognize friends of the past. Meditation awakens “sleeping memories of friendsonce more to be.”4 [part0027.html#footnote-128] Many persons whom I had seen invision, I later met; and here in America I have found many whom I saw in visionon the ship as I was first coming to this country in 1920.Friendship is a great universal force. When your desire for friendship is strongenough, though an unknown person who is spiritually attuned to you be living atthe South Pole, the magnetism of friendship will nevertheless draw you together.Only selfishness can destroy this magnetism within us. He who thinks of himselfall the time wrecks friendship. Such persons cannot attract friends, becausethey are unable to expand and receive the good in life.God gave you a family so that you may learn how to love others, and then givethat kind of love to all. Our dear ones are taken away from us by death andother circumstances that we may learn not to love persons in merely humanrelationships, but to be in love with Love Itself, which is God, the Beingbehind all human masks. “When a man beholds all separate beings as existent inthe One that has expanded Itself into the many, he merges with Brahman.”5[part0027.html#footnote-127]Friendship means investing your love where there is no prejudice of humanrelations. In married life there is the compulsion of sex, and in family lifethere is the compulsion of hereditary instincts. But in friendship there is nocompulsion.Let us give our love to all. Let us pray that we meet our friends of the pastand prove our friendship with them, so that we can finally understand and meritthe friendship of God. Unless we are united with all of His children through aspirit of friendliness, we will not be united with God.I know no strangers. What a great state of happiness and joy! Even the worstenemy cannot make me feel that I am not his friend. When that awakening comes,you are in love with all. You see that everyone is your Father’s child, and thelove you feel for all beings never dies. It grows, increasing until you realize,in the love of friends, the divine love of God.[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0027.html#footnote-131-backlink] “He finds peace who knows Me...as theInfinite Lord of Creation, and as the Good Friend of all creatures” (BhagavadGita V:29).2 [part0027.html#footnote-130-backlink] Matthew 5:44.3 [part0027.html#footnote-129-backlink] Conduct of Life: Behavior.4 [part0027.html#footnote-128-backlink] From “On Coming to the New-OldLand—America,” by Paramahansa Yogananda, in Songs of the Soul.

But the evil force in creation has inventedspurious imitations. The temporarily exhilarating effects of alcohol and drugsare counterfeits of true spiritual experiences. The use of alcohol and drugsfrequently leads to overindulgence in sex, which shuts out the power ofspiritual inspiration by tying the mind to intense body consciousness.Many people take wine to banish sad or unpleasant memories and worries, but thatkind of forgetfulness robs man of his native soul wisdom—the very power by whichhe was meant to overcome his trials and to find lasting happiness. God, beingJoy Itself, wants us to seek and to find, within our souls, His ever new bliss.The counterfeits are harmful, for they are the lures of maya, the cosmicdelusive force that is ever trying to mar all the beautiful expressions of Godin this universe. Throughout creation we see the dual forces of good and evilopposing each other: God created love, the satanic force created hate; Godcreated kindness, the satanic force created selfishness; God created peace, thesatanic force created disharmony.Knowing this, you should realize that alcohol and drugs are detrimental to yourhappiness; they obliterate the real joy and intelligence of your soul. Even onedrink, or one indulgence in drugs1 [part0028.html#footnote-133] may start apermanent habit, because there may be such a tendency already imbedded in yoursubconsciousness from past lives. What is evil should always be shunned as evil.The Wine of Spiritual Ecstasy Is IncomparableOnce you have tasted the wine of spiritual ecstasy, you will find that no otherexperience can compare with it. Ever strive to establish the divineconsciousness in your children by teaching them to meditate, that they be nottempted to play with the fire of delusive counterfeit joys. Sacred bliss isnever-ending, but the pleasures that come from alcohol and drugs areshort-lasting and ultimately bring misery.Every night in sleep you have a taste of peace and joy. While you are in deepslumber, God makes you live in the tranquil superconsciousness, in which all thefears and worries of this existence are forgotten. By meditation you canexperience that holy state of mind when you are awake, and be constantlyimmersed in healing peace.When the divine joy comes, immediately my breath is still and I am lifted intothe Spirit. I feel the bliss of a thousand sleeps rolled into one, and yet Idon’t lose my ordinary awareness. This is universally the experience of thosewho go deep in the superconscious state. When the profound ecstasy of God fallsover you, the body becomes absolutely still, the breath ceases to flow, and thethoughts are quiet—banished, every one, by the magic command of the soul. Thenyou drink of God’s bliss and experience an intoxication of joy that not athousand draughts of wine could give you.As the ordinary person drowses on the borderline of sleep, he feels a littlehappiness, but he quickly loses that awareness and is fast asleep. Sleep is nottotal unconsciousness, for when you awaken, you always know whether you sleptwell or not.There are various kinds of sleep—some light and some deep. But more intoxicatingthan even the most blissful slumber are those spiritual experiences one may haveconsciously with God. Beyond the mysteries of the sleepland lie all these divinejoys. I can remain in any state I wish to. Often I stay between the sleeplandand the awareness of the world—in the superconscious state.Consciousness Has a Limitless SpanYour mind has a vast, a limitless, span; but you do not realize it. I can gointo the depths of sleep and enjoy the sleep state and at the same time be withthe world. Or I can sleep and dream, and at the same time also hear everythingthat is going on around me. Sometimes I sleep just as the ordinary person does,and again I can sleep and consciously watch myself sleeping. In thesuperconscious state you can see that your body and mind are sleeping and yethave total awareness of all happenings. This is possible only when you havedeveloped the ability to enter at will the superconsciousness, and return atwill to the ordinary state of mind.You need never worry that by meditation (or by imagination or by the practice ofinner silence) you may go out of the body and fail to return. That idea isentirely false. The maya-induced attachment to the body is so powerful that youcan’t escape from it that easily! Even if your ordinary waking awareness isobliterated, so long as your subconscious mind remains tied to the body youcannot leave it permanently.What Is the Proof of Self-realization?If you imagine something very strongly, it becomes visible as a hallucination,having no intrinsic reality. You should understand the difference betweenimagination and Self-realization. The essential proof of Self-realization—ofGod’s consciousness in you—is to be truly and unconditionally happy. If you arereceiving more and more joy in meditation, without cessation, you may know thatGod is making manifest His presence in you. If there is a break in the flow ofdivine happiness, then there is something wrong in your consciousness, some kinkthat needs to be removed with the help of your guru. By maintaining steadycommunion with him, through daily meditation and by following his precepts—thesadhana2 [part0028.html#footnote-132] he has given you—he will straighten outthat kink for you.You cannot be with the Lord just by thinking you are divinely enlightened. Youmust improve yourself—you must perfect yourself. There is a lot of differencebetween the potential realization of God and the actual realization of God. Youcan never know Him except through humbleness, wisdom, and devotion. The humbleman is the one who will know God.Those who go deep in the superconsciousness automatically develop unusualspiritual powers, and control over natural forces. But no man of trueGod-consciousness ever uses his powers unwisely, for egotistical display. Sagesrealize that the Lord is the Sole Doer, and humbly return to Him theextraordinary gifts He has bestowed on them. Is not everything in the universe amiracle? By his mere existence is not man a miracle? If human beings are notsatisfied with all the wonders that God has created, why should His saintsperform further miracles? They never do, unless—for some special reason, oftenan unfathomable one—the Lord so commands them.Beyond the Kaleidoscope of SubconsciousnessI will illustrate how the superconsciousness differs from the subconsciousness.The superconscious is that state in which you can consciously, duringwakefulness or sleep, produce any sensation in your body at will, without anyexternal stimulus. That is the proof. In the subconscious dreamland you candrink a glass of hot milk, but this experience comes to you unbidden; in thesuperconscious state you can create that or any other experience consciously andat will. Unless you are able to do this, do not delude yourself that you havereached superconsciousness.Millions of devotees never get beyond the kaleidoscope of the subconscious mind,which manifests its wonders mostly during sleep. But in the superconscious stateyou can see or know anything that you wish to—not by imagination but in reality.I can sit in this chair and transfer my mind to India and see exactly what isgoing on in my old home there.The advancing devotee progresses through three stages of spiritual awareness,the Sacred Trinity: First he experiences superconsciousness, oneness with thecreative power in creation: Aum, “God the Holy Ghost.” Next comes ChristConsciousness, merging in the Infinite Intelligence within creation: Tat, “Godthe Son.” Finally, he attains the highest, Cosmic Consciousness, the Truthbeyond creation, the ineffable Absolute: Sat, “God the Father.”Sometimes a devotee dwells in the subconsciousness, sometimes he is lifted tosuperconsciousness and to Christ Consciousness, and a few great souls are ableto go beyond Christ Consciousness into Cosmic Consciousness, the realm ofCauseless Spirit.In the Christ-conscious state you don’t have to visualize things first in orderto experience them. You don’t have to picture India—you are there; you are awareof all creation. That experience is an endless expansion of consciousness. Youare in the blade of grass and on the mountaintop; and you can feel every cell ofyour body and every atom of space.But Cosmic Consciousness is beyond even that. When you can feel your presence inall creation, and also know the Joy that is beyond creation, then you are aGodlike being.[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0028.html#footnote-133-backlink] Except when prescribed as necessary by areputable medical doctor, and taken under his supervision.2 [part0028.html#footnote-132-backlink] The path of spiritual discipline andinstruction given to one by his guru.

The Self-Realization Technique ofConcentration1 [part0029.html#footnote-143] helps greatly to improve the qualityand power of one’s concentration. Its practice will save the earnest seeker fromyears of fruitless wandering on the subconscious plane. That land you want toavoid; it is full of illusory and imaginative spiritual experiences. One mustreach the superconscious state to have real spiritual experiences andrealizations of truth.2 [part0029.html#footnote-142]The world has a habit of much teaching and little practicing. You may hear alecture on sugar a hundred times, but you will not know its flavor until youhave tasted it. Neither can the glory of any true teaching be known except bypractice. You have to live the teachings of the prophets and the great ones.Then their truths become your own, and you realize that truth is demonstrable,and universal. When you practice truth—whether you call yourself a Christian, aHindu, a Buddhist, or a devotee of any other religion—Christ will claim you, andso will Krishna, Buddha, and all other divine incarnations of Truth.Follow the path of truth steadfastly. Remember that out of thousands, only a fewseek God; and out of those seekers, perhaps only one really knows Him.3[part0029.html#footnote-141] He who is persistent will realize God. So try yourbest to make meditation a regular experience in your life. May you never forgetGod and never be satisfied until you have Him! Be able to say, “Behind thisfinite frame I feel the Infinite.” I never come to class until I know He is withme. I never teach unless I have made that complete communion. And I know thatwhen I talk from that plane students will not forget what they have learned.Concentration—A Requisite for Finding GodTo be able to concentrate is essential for spiritual progress; withoutconcentration you shall never find God. Learn how to shut out of yourconsciousness all sounds and other earthly distractions. As soon as yourconsciousness is right, God is there. He isn’t hiding from you; you are hidingfrom Him. When in deep meditation you see any inner light,4[part0029.html#footnote-140] try to hold it, and to feel you are inside it, onewith it. That is where God is. Try to realize you are that light of God.The more peace you feel during concentration and the longer you concentrate, thedeeper you will go in God. If the time given to reading books about spiritualtruth were spent in meditation, you would have far greater advancement bothmentally and spiritually. Sleep less, and give more hours to meditation; therest you will enjoy is a hundred times more refreshing than sleep.Unless you can cut off sounds from your consciousness you cannot reach God. Thatis why saints have sought the seclusion of caves and forests. Plunge into theinner silence again and again by practicing the methods of concentration andmeditation I have given you, and you will find great peace and happiness. TheGita says: “Free from ever-hoping desires and from cravings for possessions,with the heart (waves of feeling) controlled by the soul (by yogaconcentration), retiring alone to a quiet place, the yogi should constantly tryto unite with the soul.”5 [part0029.html#footnote-139]The silence of deep meditation should be practiced more in all churches andtemples. Everyone should talk less. During my hermitage training in India myguru, Swami Sri Yukteswar, would lecture to us only once in a while. Most of thetime we sat around him without any talking, and concentrated within. If we evenstirred, he would reprove us. A real teacher possesses more than book knowledge,and in spiritual life it is necessary to learn wisdom from such a teacher; onewho knows, and knows that he knows, because he has experienced—not merely readabout—truth.The Invisible Source of Visible WorldsSpace is divided into two parts or aspects. On one side of space is creation. Onthe other side is God alone; creation is completely absent. That is the world ofthe “darkless dark” and the “lightless light.” In the Gita the Lord says: “Whereno sun or moon or fire shines, that is My Supreme Abode....”6[part0029.html#footnote-138]The same duality is true of human consciousness. Your being has two sides—onevisible, the other invisible. With open eyes you behold objective creation, andyourself in it. With closed eyes you see nothing, a dark void; yet yourconsciousness, even when dissociated from form, is still keenly aware andoperative. If in deep meditation you penetrate the darkness behind closed eyes,you behold the Light from which all creation emerges. By deeper samadhi, yourexperience transcends even the manifested Light and enters the All-BlissfulConsciousness—beyond all form, yet infinitely more real, tangible, and joyousthan any sensory or supersensory perception.God has given you the opportunity to observe in your own consciousness theoperation of the same laws that govern the universe. The state of consciousnesswithout form that is experienced with closed eyes may be compared to the endlessregion of “darkless dark” and “lightless light,” where God exists without any ofthe forms, qualities, and dualities that characterize the sphere of His materialcreation. In this boundless stretch of eternity behind creation, God alone livesin the unqualified consciousness of ever-existing, ever-conscious, ever-newBliss. No world or any other created thing exists in His consciousness in thatpart of infinity where He reigns as the Absolute. But on the other side of spaceHe is aware of everything—all creation—in Himself.In the Invisible is the factory of the universe. Einstein said that space looksvery suspicious, because everything comes out of it and everything disappearsinto it. Whither do electrons vanish, and whole worlds?Any time you become fascinated by some material creation, close your eyes, lookwithin, and contemplate its Source. You see nothing, feel nothing. Yet allvisible objects have come out of that Invisible. “The light shineth indarkness.”7 [part0029.html#footnote-137] If you keep peering into the darknessyou will find that great Light. Behind the darkness is the Christ Consciousness.Behind the darkness is the teeming life of other worlds. “In my Father’s houseare many mansions.”8 [part0029.html#footnote-136]Right behind space is Intelligence. And right behind you is God. Live no longerin ignorance of His presence. Churn the darkness with your meditation. Don’tstop until you find Him. There is so much to know! so much to see within! Theanswer to every problem will come to you straight from the Infinite. The truthsthat I perceive within by meditation reveal the basis of physiological laws thatscience is discovering by other methods. When I close my eyes, I can see thesubtle life currents flowing in my body.In the quietness you experience when your eyes are closed, don’t feel you arealone. God is with you. Why should you think He is not? The ether is filled withmusic that is caught by the radio—music that otherwise you would not know about.And so it is with God. He is with you every minute of your existence, yet theonly way to realize this is to meditate. And those of you who do meditate shouldgo deeper! Don’t fall asleep at night until you actually feel some expression ofthe presence of God within you. Peer into that darkness until you discover itswondrous secrets.For your encouragement I tell you of an experience I had today in thesuperconscious state. I was sitting in the library at Mt. Washington. It wasabout four o’clock. Suddenly my breath disappeared. My limbs became rigid. Ifound myself watching the process of death. Breath and movement had left mybody, yet I was conscious. This experience of death was wonderful. I saw my bodyand all nature as a cosmic motion picture, created from God’s light. Joyously Icried, “There is no death, Lord! This whole world is nothing but a movie!”A ruler on his throne may say, “Ah, I am king!” but let death give one knock andhe is gone. He is a real king who feels God in all forms in creation. Deathshall not frighten him, because he beholds it as a portal to the divine kingdom.The First Path to Cosmic ConsciousnessOf the three ways to expand human consciousness into cosmic consciousness, thefirst is the social way, wherein you shut out “self” and live for all. Be loyalto your friends, and feel love for everyone. God gave you a family that youmight expand your consciousness by caring and doing for others. In family lifewe learn love and self-sacrifice for our loved ones, and thus attain someexpansion of consciousness. But this is not enough. Love that becomes personalis exclusive, confined; when love becomes impersonal, it expands. Developimpersonal love; be able to give everyone the same love that you bestow on yourfamily, and to do for others exactly as you would for yourself. The social wayto cosmic consciousness is to behave toward everyone in this way.God loves all His children alike—they are all His divine family, and His love isimpersonal. His children should give that same kind of love to one another. Thisis the divine plan. To forget it is to suffer. The whole world-attitude shouldchange. You are everyone, because your true nature is omnipresence.I enjoy giving things to others; I feel the greatest happiness in seeing theirjoy. When we feel for and love others, we find that all of creation responds tous. Jesus, who gave up his body “as a ransom for many,”9[part0029.html#footnote-135] showed us the social way of attaining cosmicconsciousness. Christlike, you too should serve all men as your Self.The man of cosmic consciousness is a happy man. He doesn’t limit his love to afew, excluding everyone else. So should you make the whole world your ownfamily. Will you remember? This consciousness is with me every moment. I have nocaste, no country—I feel that all are mine. Love all men as your brothers, loveall women as your sisters, and all older people as your parents. Love all humanbeings as your friends.The Second PathThe second way to cosmic consciousness is the way of self-discipline. Do not bea victim of immoderation. Enjoy things, but don’t be attached to them. Be free.Be pleasant and self-controlled. Avoid becoming a slave to wrong habits, and actonly according to your righteous convictions. To attain cosmic consciousness itis necessary to possess self-control and to rise above dualities—heat and cold,pleasure and sorrow, health and sickness. Learn to endure all things without anyexcitement or disturbance of mind. “He who is everywhere nonattached, neitherjoyously excited by encountering good nor disturbed by evil, has an establishedwisdom.”10 [part0029.html#footnote-134]The Third and Highest PathLastly is the way of meditation—the metaphysical path. If while meditating youare still conscious of the breath, you are tied to body awareness. To entercosmic consciousness one must free himself from the bonds of the body throughguru-given meditation methods.If you put a sealed jar of water in a tank of water, that which is in the jar isseparated from that which surrounds the jar; but if you remove the lid, thewater in the jar and the water in the tank can mingle. Similarly, ordinarypeople shut out God because their consciousness is sealed in by the lid ofignorance. When that lid is removed by right methods of meditation, one feelsthe peace of God inside and outside the body. As you increase the length anddepth of your meditations you will find more and more peace, and an ever newjoy. Whatever else you may try, it will not produce the divine consciousnessthat comes from meditation.The Lord is all around, but you don’t feel Him. And you cannot feel Him, withinor without, until you remove the lid of ignorance and merge your consciousnesswith His, to discover Him within yourself. If you sink in material desire youwill suffocate. If you sink in the ocean of God you will live forevermore.Once you have found God, you experience real and lasting satisfaction. Humanfriendships may be severed, but God will never leave you. Though everyone elseforsake you, if you have Him, you have everything.[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0029.html#footnote-143-backlink] Concentration is a state of completeone-pointedness and stillness of consciousness. The nature of creation ismotion; the nature of Spirit is motionlessness. “Be still, and know that I amGod” (Psalms 46:10). Concentration is therefore essential to divine communion.The techniques of concentration and meditation taught in Self-RealizationFellowship Lessons lead to perfect attunement of human consciousness to divineconsciousness. (See Concentration Technique [part0074.html#_idTextAnchor095] inglossary.)2 [part0029.html#footnote-142-backlink] The subconscious level of man’sawareness has its usefulness as the repository of memory and as the land ofsleep and dream. But in meditation it can be a real deterrent, luring theabsentminded, imaginative, or psychically inclined aspirant into a realm offanciful hallucinations that have no more reality or spiritual value than one’sordinary dreams at night. Scientific meditation techniques, and the devotee’sown effort to practice them correctly, draw the mind instead to thesuperconscious state of Self-realization and God-communion.3 [part0029.html#footnote-141-backlink] “Among thousands of men, perhaps onestrives for spiritual attainment; and, among the blessed true seekers thatassiduously try to reach Me, perhaps one perceives Me as I am” (Bhagavad GitaVII:3).4 [part0029.html#footnote-140-backlink] The light of God or the spiritual eye.5 [part0029.html#footnote-139-backlink] Bhagavad Gita VI:10.6 [part0029.html#footnote-138-backlink] Bhagavad Gita XV:6.7 [part0029.html#footnote-137-backlink] John 1:5.8 [part0029.html#footnote-136-backlink] John 14:2.9 [part0029.html#footnote-135-backlink] Matthew 20:28.10 [part0029.html#footnote-134-backlink] Bhagavad Gita II:57."},{"pageContent":"Be a Smile MillionaireSelf-Realization Fellowship Temple, Hollywood, California, January 29, 1950The real smile is the smile of bliss that comes when you meditate, when you feelthe joy of God’s presence. That is the smile on Lahiri Mahasaya’s1[part0030.html#footnote-146] face. He is seeing the world partially, but seeingGod fully. My smile comes from a joy deep within my being, a joy that you alsomay attain. Like a fragrance it oozes out from the core of the blossoming soul.This joy calls others to bathe in its waters of divine bliss.The average man is familiar with four states of mind. When a desire isfulfilled, he is happy. When a desire is denied, he is unhappy. When he isneither glad nor sorrowful, he is bored. When these three emotions, these threestates of mind—pleasure, pain, and boredom—are sloughed off, he has peace.Beyond Peace Is BlissPeace is the absence of the alternations of sorrow and pleasure, and the absenceof boredom. It is a very desirable state. After a tumultuous ride on the crestsof pain and pleasure, with frequent dips into the troughs of boredom, you enjoyfloating on the calm sea of peace. But greater than peace is bliss—bliss of thesoul. It is an ever new joy that never disappears, but remains with your soulthrough eternity. That joy can be attained only by perceiving God.If you place a pot of water under the rays of the moon and then agitate thewater, you create a distorted reflection of the moon. When you still the wavesin the pot, the reflection becomes clear. The time when the water in the pot isquiet and clearly reflecting the moon, is comparable to the meditative state ofpeace, and the still deeper state of calmness. In the peace of meditation allwaves of sensations and thoughts are absent from the mind. In the deeper stateof calmness, one perceives in that stillness the moonèd reflection of God’spresence. Peace is a negative state, being merely the absence of the waves ofpleasure, pain, and indifference; and so after a little while the meditator isattracted once more by the desire to experience the waves of motion. But asmeditative peace deepens into calmness and the ultimate positive state of bliss,the meditator experiences a joy that is ever new and all-satisfying.When you sleep, you still thoughts and sensations passively. When by meditationyou still thoughts and sensations consciously, you experience first the state ofpeace; and the muscles of your face will form a smile that reflects the peace ofyour heart. But you must look beyond peace in order to behold, undistorted bysensory stimuli and motor reflexes from sense-associated thoughts, the purity ofyour soul. The state you feel then is ever new bliss. Saints always have thisjoy in their hearts. Secure in the divine inner assurance, they are unshaken byanger or fear. Using the scalpel of reason or intuition, they can dissect theirown or others’ thoughts on the operating table of the mind and remain unmoved.“In soul bliss all grief is annihilated. Indeed, the discrimination of theblissful man soon becomes firmly established (in the Self).”2[part0030.html#footnote-145]Smile With the Love of GodMost smiles are born of good emotions arising out of doing good, or out offeeling sympathy, love, kindness, or mercy. But the most wonderful way to smileis to fill your heart with the love of God. Then you will be able to loveeverybody; you will be able to smile all the time. All other forms of smiles areevanescent because emotions flicker and pass away, no matter how good they are.The only thing that can last is the joy of God. When you have that, you cansmile all the time. Otherwise, when you are feeling merciful toward someone andhe returns your kindness with a slap, you won’t be able to feel mercy toward himany longer.A man I knew made a great show of his distress when his wife died. I saw throughhis emotionalism. “You will marry within a month,” I told him. He was so angryat me he would not see me after that, but he did remarry within a month. Hethought his love for the first wife was so great, but you see how quickly heforgot her.I shall never forget how much my guru, Sri Yukteswarji, taught me when he toldme this little story about his life: “When I was a little boy I took a notionthat I wanted an ugly little dog belonging to a neighbor. I kept my household inturmoil for weeks to get that dog. My ears were deaf to offers of pets with moreprepossessing appearance. I wanted only that dog.”The same sort of fixation seizes people in so-called romance. Lovers becomehypnotized by a face; they can’t forget it. But the real beauty we should seekin others is not outward, but inward.When your soul is filled with joy you are attractive. I like only divine smiles,because without them, human beings are like puppets—today they are saying theywill love you forever; tomorrow they are in the grave. Where is their great lovethen? Where is the promise, “I’ll love you forever”? But if you can make God sayeven once to you, “I love you,” it is for eternity. Why do you waste your timefor a little human love, and money, and this and that, when in God you can findeverything—all the love that is in the whole world, all the power in creation?But don’t seek Him for power; seek Him for love. Then you will discover thechink in His armor. When you give Him your unconditional love, He can no longerrefuse you Himself.To Find Bliss, MeditateMeditate more. You do not know how wonderful it is. It is much greater tomeditate than to spend hours seeking money or human love or anything else thatyou can think of. The more you meditate, and the more your mind stays centeredin the spiritual state during activity, the more you will be able to smile. I amalways there now, in that bliss-consciousness of God. Nothing affects me;whether I am alone or with people, that joy of the Lord is always there. I haveretained my smile—but to win it permanently was hard work! The same smiles arethere within you; the same joy and bliss of the soul is there. You don’t have toacquire them, but rather regain them. You have merely lost them temporarily byidentifying yourself with the senses.If you think that objects of sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch will giveyou supreme joy, you are mightily mistaken. They will only take it away. If youput conditions around your joy—“without the sight of that face I cannot behappy”—you will never find unalloyed bliss. Because no sense-produced pleasureis permanent. Time relentlessly works its havoc on physical beauty; everythingin the material world is subject to change. Therefore if you could see all thebeautiful faces in the world; if you were to hear all the music and toucheverything that you desire to, you would still not have found real happiness.You may imagine you are happy, however. Sometimes, after you have dug and dug toget at some object of desire, you find no happiness in the object itself, yetyou derive a certain satisfaction from the labor you have put into getting it,and you therefore think you are happy. But such satisfactions are short-lived.So do not seek your happiness in the senses. Find joy within and express it inyour face. When you do that, wherever you go a little smile will surchargeeveryone with your divine magnetism. Everybody will be happy!But remember it is the Lord alone who changes each heart; we must not at allascribe to ourselves the power to do good. The only one who does good is God. Itis His world. If you feel Him as the Indweller of this body—that it is He whoworks in everything; and if you give everything—both good and bad actions—toHim, you will be surprised to see how all your actions gradually will be changedto good. You will not be able to do anything wrong when the consciousness of Godis with you. Give your life to Him. In all you do, say, “It’s You, Lord, not I!Not I, Lord!” Destroy ego; it is a great obstruction to this liberatingrealization. You are not the Doer; can you lift your hand if the Lord quenchesthe little beam of life in your medulla oblongata?3 [part0030.html#footnote-144]How to Banish External ImpressionsOnce I was sitting outdoors at Encinitas, and it was very cold. I turned myconsciousness within, and in a twinkling I couldn’t feel the cold at all. Joycame over me; once in a while I saw my surroundings melt into one light, likethe beam of a motion picture. If I concentrated on the picture, I saw thepicture. If I concentrated on the beam, the world vanished. You cannot seeanything without your consciousness. So if you have full mastery over your mind,and you look within at your soul, even though your eyes are open you will seeonly that great light of God, and feel His great joy. Only as you look outwardthrough the eyes will your consciousness perceive the outer world. It is allGod's motion picture. I could see, that day in Encinitas, on one side thesensations and thoughts that were dreams of my consciousness which came fromGod, and on the other side, as I retired within, no sensations at all—just purejoy. And though I was sitting in that extreme cold, clad only in swim trunks, Icould feel the cold and the scenery disappear and joy alone come; later I feltthe slight impressions of sensations together with that great joy.Practice this—practice the presence of God. Don’t be satisfied with a littleprayer, or seeing a little light, and then going to bed. Sleep is a drug. If youcan fairly control sex; if you can fairly control all the senses; and if you goafter God with all the power of your soul, He will come to you. Even if you area great moralist and a spiritually inclined person, without the perception ofGod you have very little.So do not deceive yourself. Meditate more—unceasingly and sincerely. Tell God,“I know my weaknesses. But Lord, they belong to You, because You created me. Ihave no wish for anything except to be with You, because You are the One who isshowing this movie. You are free from its dual aspects of comedy and tragedy. Soam I free, because I am Your child.”Don’t call yourself a sinner; nor call yourself righteous and be proud. Sayrather that the Lord is with you, and that He—no one else!—is working throughyou. Then you will see a different world. Without the consciousness of God thisworld appears full of struggle, violence, and terrible disappointments. But withHim it is a haven of happiness.When I was watching the motion picture, Song of Bernadette, I was so deeplytouched by some of the events in the saint’s life that I cried. At last I said:“What’s the matter with me?” I looked at the picture again and saw only shadowsand light; I lost the consciousness of drama. I couldn’t cry anymore; a greatjoyous state came over me.The Motion Picture of CreationIn a second, God can duplicate the form of any person who has gone out of theworld; He wants you to know that. He wants you to understand that this creationis a show. If you take the show seriously, you are going to get hurt, and youwon’t like it; you won’t be able to stand life, with its sorrow and disease andpain. Whenever anything hurts the body, I put my mind at the seat of spiritualawareness at the point between the eyebrows; then I feel no pain at all. Butwhen I concentrate on the hurt, I feel the delusion of pain. If you can keepyour mind centered in the spiritual consciousness of your soul you will notsuffer when the delusive shadows of sorrow appear on your mental screen. Pray toGod unceasingly to reveal Himself as the sole joyous Reality.You have already lost so much time—death may take you away at any moment, andthen you won’t have time to know Him. You must realize Him before you go out ofthe body cage. Tell Him, “I want to feel Your presence.” But He won’t let youout of this hospital of delusion permanently until you cure yourself of thedisease of desires. Do everything for God. Working for Him is just as importantto your spiritual progress as meditation.Meditate on the Lord at night until you are uplifted in Him and feel locked inHis joy; and when you come down to perform activities during the day, bring andkeep with you the remembrance of that state. Then you will be all the time withGod. And you will always be able to smile and say, “A little bit of sorrow or alittle bit of pleasure or a little bit of peace cannot create any tumult in theocean of ever new bliss that fills my soul.”Laugh at maya, delusion. Watch life as a cosmic motion picture, then it cannotwork its delusive magic on you anymore. Be in God-bliss. When you can standunshaken ’midst the crash of breaking worlds, you shall know that God is real.He doesn’t mean to hurt you. He has made you in His image. He has made youalready what He is. That is what you don’t realize, because you acknowledge onlythat you are a human being; you do not know that this thought is a delusion.When you are suffering from cancer it is not fun. Yet St. Francis suffered fromdiseases and at the same time he was healing the sick and raising the dead. Hisdivine joy could not be taken away. So by all means get to God. But He won’treceive you until you prove to Him that you do want Him and that you have nodesire to get mixed up in His show.Don’t Question God—Love HimNor should you question God. You will reap only doubt. You will not be able tounderstand His laws until you become one with Him. So why waste time trying tounderstand them by an intellectual approach? If you are reading a novel in whichthe hero is being mistreated, the villain is winning, and each chapter seems tocontradict the preceding one, you will feel frustrated and angry with theauthor. But when you read the last chapter you are satisfied, and you think howwonderful that novel was because it was so complex. So God is theMaster-Novelist, and one is wonderstruck at the paradoxes and intricate plot ofHis creation. Don’t try to solve these riddles; you will be lost. When you findHim, in that last chapter, He will give you the solutions to all the enigmas ofhuman life. And you won’t be able to question His wisdom when you hear Hisreplies. That I know!Live with God in your heart and have no fear in the world—fear will be afraid ofyou! You will be free from this cosmic delusion. Then you will smile, “I know atlast the mystery of it all.” But don’t try to know first; love God first. ThenHe will tell you everything. And you can smile an eternal smile. Your thoughts,your words, your writings, and everything you do will be impregnated with thejoy shining in that smile. Wherever you meditate you will leave behind afragrance of smiles, and whoever will come there will also be moved to smilewith God. You can smile all the time when you dwell in His ineffable bliss.[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0030.html#footnote-146-backlink] A reference to the photograph of LahiriMahasaya, the guru of Paramahansa Yogananda’s guru.

That is why thou dost say I am away. I amalways in. Come in and thou wilt see Me. I am always here, ready to greet thee.”Deep sincerity is necessary in the spiritual path. In guilelessness comes thebirth of Spirit. Jesus said: “Thou hast hid these things from the wise andprudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.”2[part0031_split_000.html#footnote-150] Before God our human wisdom is nothing.The only way we can coax Him to surrender Himself to us is by offering to Himthe same unconditional love that He gives to us.Everyone will eventually find salvation, but those who tarry on the way fallinto the ditch of indifference. Indifference prevents man from realizing howimportant it is to find God now, in this moment. Our great whirling planet, ourhuman individuality, were not given to us merely that we might exist for a timeand then vanish into nothingness, but that we might question what it is allabout. To live without understanding the purpose of life is foolish, a waste oftime. The mystery of life surrounds us; we were given intelligence in order tosolve it.God Is the Lover Behind All LoveI have realized, by searching for lasting love, that it was Someone Else whocared for me through all human loves. The Divine has loved me as mother, asfather, and as friends. I searched for that one Friend behind all friends, thatone Lover whom I now see glimmering in all your faces. And that Friend neverfails me.God is behind everything. “Honor thy father and thy mother,”3[part0031_split_000.html#footnote-149] but “love the Lord thy God with all thineheart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.”4[part0031_split_000.html#footnote-148] You should understand the importance ofcultivating divine friendship with Him, and of not wasting any more time. How doyou know, when you go to sleep, whether or not you will wake up? One by one weleave this earth. But there is nothing to grieve about. When we die, we arerequired to be reborn on earth, starting another life where we left off in thisone.I behold life and death like the rise and fall of waves on the sea. At birth awave rises from the surface, and at death it sinks into sleep in the bosom ofGod. I have realized this. I know I can never die; for whether I am sleeping inthe ocean of Spirit or awake in a physical body, I am ever with Him. Thatsupreme happiness cannot be found in the world; but we need not run away to thejungle to seek Him. We can find Him in this jungle of daily life, in the cave ofinner silence.It doesn’t matter how many mistakes you have made; they are only temporary. Youare formed in the image of Spirit. The Lord created this delusory motion pictureof earth and all its pleasures for but one purpose: that perchance you would seethrough His play of maya and forsake it to love Him alone. This is the truth; itcannot be otherwise. Why are we made to feel love for our family members, onlyto watch them slip away, one by one? These events take place to help us realizethat it is He who is loving us behind all loved ones.The difficulty about this motion picture of life is that all unrealities seemreal, and all realities seem unreal. Each night in sleep the world is made todisappear from our consciousness, so we might understand that the materialuniverse is not real. This lesson of sleep comes not to frighten us, but to makeus seek the reality of God. The soul can never be satisfied with anything butHim and His love. His spirit is the reality that nothing else can match.5[part0031_split_000.html#footnote-147]Don’t Waste TimeSo many years are gone from our lives already. And only so many years, weeks,days, and hours are left. Don’t waste time. In your heart, tell Him night andday, “Lord, I want Thee.” Never be insincere about that. Never reason, “TomorrowI will seek God. Today let me have a good time.” Always say, “Today, my Lord,today I want Thee.”Just now I see the great light of God spread everywhere—such joy, such light!“Lord, I bow to Thee on this beautiful occasion in which Thou art born in us innew glory. May I always be blessed with awareness of Thy presence, and may eachone of us here be thus blessed, that we may all know Thou art seeking to be bornanew in our consciousness.”Love Him, talk to Him every second of your life, in activity and in silence,with deep prayer, with the unceasing desire of your heart; and you shall see thescreen of delusion melt away. He who is playing hide-and-seek in the beauty offlowers, in souls, in noble passions, in dreams, shall come forth and say: “Youand I have been apart for a long time, because I desired that you give Me yourlove willingly. You are made in My image, and I wanted to see if you would useyour freedom to give Me your love.”I pray that God give you the imperishable gift of His love. But without effortyou won’t find Him. If you make twenty-five percent of the effort, the rest ofit will come through God and guru. This evening has passed like a moment, for Hehas been with me every second. This is what I wanted to feel, that you areshowing appreciation to me merely to express your appreciation of Him who sentme. May His blessings be ever with you; may His consciousness never leave you.May you realize, within and without, the fullness of His presence.Call God Your OwnGod doesn’t readily respond to us, because we are shy before Him; we fail toshow how much we want Him. Don’t be afraid of Him. Call Him your own and pursueHim unceasingly, in thought and in action, and you shall find Him to be thegreatest haven of safety.“I offer the bouquet of these souls to Thee, O Father, that they may adorn thealtar of Thy presence. Be Thou unceasingly with them. Father, Thou art the headof this family. We are Thy children, gathered together to sing the glory of Thyname. Banish the darkness of ignorance with Thy light; drive away all gloom fromthe shores of our minds with the expanding light of Thy presence. Naughty orgood, we are Thy children. Reveal Thyself unto us. Bless everyone here. I feeltheir kind thoughts for me. All kindness, honor, respect, and love given to me,I offer to Thee, O Father! Thou art my love, my all.“Bless us with Thy grace. Destroy our desire for anything but Thee. Be Thou theKing sitting on the throne of all our ambitions. Let the light of Thy gloryspread over the vast world. Bless us all, saturate us with Thy presence. May werealize more and more that Thou hast always been ours. Thou art ours now; Thouwilt ever be ours. We thank Thee for the benediction and love Thou hast bestowedupon Thy family assembled here. May we all someday celebrate Thy birth in us ineternity, in immortality, and in unceasing joy.”Pray with me: “Our Father, bless us that when we are free, we may gather inheaven to celebrate Thy birth within us. Manifest Thyself within and without.Unite us all; in the light of that union may we find Thy One Presence. With allthe devotion of our merged hearts, of our united souls, we fall at Thy feet ofomnipresence. Bless us that we never be indifferent to Thee. May an undying fireof love possess our hearts. We bow to Thee, our Father, our very own. Thypresence be with us now and forever.”[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0031_split_000.html#footnote-151-backlink] I Corinthians 3:16.2 [part0031_split_000.html#footnote-150-backlink] Matthew 11:25.3 [part0031_split_000.html#footnote-149-backlink] Matthew 19:19.4 [part0031_split_000.html#footnote-148-backlink] Deuteronomy 6:5.5 [part0031_split_000.html#footnote-147-backlink] “Of the unreal, there is noexistence.

Resolve that you are going to do just what youthink you should do, and that under no circumstances are you going to be cowedinto doing otherwise by your old bad habits.There was a great lesson for me in the book I have been writing. I used to writewithout ever reading over the manuscript—a task I always avoided. But I had togo over and over every bit of my autobiography.1 [part0032.html#footnote-156]The Lord disciplined me, yet in a noble way, because I have enjoyed relivingthose wondrous experiences as I read the account again.I have ventured many projects in this life. I have lectured, designed and builtbuildings, done artwork, played musical instruments, planted gardens, founded aschool, but always the secret of my success was will power. I can truthfully saythat destiny is what you make it.Analyze yourself. What happened to your good intentions and noble ambitions ofthe past year? Did you let them die for want of dynamic will-to-accomplish? Makea strong determination to avoid repetition of old errors in this New Year. Planyour time. Resolve that you are not going to be an automaton run by the worldand by your own habits; that is not the way to true happiness. You must change;you must be able to change. Vague desire to improve is not enough. You have madeyourself what you are now, and you can become whatever you want to be, but youhave to use will power.More confining than stone walls are the prison bars of habit. You carry thisinvisible prison with you wherever you go. But you can be free! Determine now tobreak out of the jail of habits and race for freedom. How frightful life is,that from the age of three we are limited by habit. As soon as I realized I wascaged in by habit I broke through all the bars. I would not permit myself to bebound by habits that made me say, “I can’t do that,” or, “I have to do this,”or, “Don’t do that to me, it makes me nervous,” or, “I can’t stand the cold,”and so on.Why are these habits so strong from early childhood? Because they have beencarried over from previous-life experiences. Our moods are inkmarks traced onthe graph of life by the karma of the past. Wrong habits and moods are moreoffensive than the odor of the skunk. Why behave like a human polecat, makingeveryone else uncomfortable and punishing yourself as well? At one time oranother we all have done so, because we all have carried with us obnoxiouspeculiarities.Reclaim Your Lost DivinityBut we can overcome undesirable traits. The human mind is elastic. If you pullit gradually, it will yield to your tugs. Yet you don’t even try. God has givenus more than enough power to overcome all the trials and shortcomings of ourlives. Saint Francis, though ill and sightless, could heal the sick and raisethe dead. Outwardly blind, inwardly he beheld the great Light of the universe.God puts His true children such as Saint Francis to greater tests than He givesto ordinary people. But no one passes through the gates of freedom until he haspassed all God’s tests, until he has learned to live like a true son of God. Whyshould you think of yourself as a weak mortal? You are potentially a son of God.You do not have to acquire anything; you have only to know.To try to be a millionaire in this incarnation is really much more difficultthan to be a true son of God. Earthly environment is so limited that many peopledie without having become what they want to be. But to know God is possible inone lifetime, because you don’t have to acquire Him; He is already your own.Even if everyone were to pray day and night to become as rich as Henry Ford,their prayers could not be granted because earth is not a place where everybodycan be a Henry Ford. But everyone can be rich in Spirit, for God has giveneveryone equal power to become like Him. When you claim your divinity,everything belongs to you. A Henry Ford might lose his wealth or his health, buta Jesus Christ can create health or wealth or anything else he wants, at will.So don’t long to be as rich or as healthy as someone else; have only one desire:to be like God. Jesus never claimed that he was the only son of God. The Fatherloves you, His child, just as much as He loves Jesus. And God won’t deny youanything if, like Jesus, you establish your true status with Him. Meditation isthe way to reclaim your lost divinity.Habits are grafts on our real nature, which is ever free Spirit. In my childhoodI used to get very angry, but when I made up my mind not to, I never again gavein to anger. If I hadn’t used my will I wouldn’t have been able to accomplishthat, or anything else in this life. You too can use your will. The errors of alifetime can be corrected today. Make a resolution in this New Year to realizethe truth that although as a mortal man you have certain habits, as a divinebeing you are free. Why should you lie to yourself? Why should you ascribe toyourself the faults of the past? You must destroy them. Otherwise they willbecome grafts on your tree of life. You must not allow that. Affirm again andagain: “I am a child of God. I am one with God.”Apply Will and Discrimination to ResolutionEvery strong resolution you make with great determination can become a habit atonce. Why should you not be able to do what you wish, guided by reason? You musttry. Away with all your faults! Review your actions of the past year. See whattroublesome habits you may have displayed: perhaps you fight with people, or youeat too much, or you are jealous. Make up your mind today, and know that you arenever going to do those things again. Just say to yourself, “Paramahansaji saidhe had an aversion to editing, but he became an editor; and if he could makehimself an editor, I can do this.” Why couldn’t you? Everything I have tried todo with will power has worked. And I give you hope that if you make up yourmind, you too will succeed. God has given you the power to dynamite yourtroubles. “Beware, O ye mountains, stand not in my way! Your ribs will beshattered and tattered today!” Those words are from a song by a great swami.2[part0032.html#footnote-155] In another part he sang, “I hitch to my chariot thefates and the gods!”The Romans used to tie prisoners to chariots and drag them on the ground—aterrible practice! Yet in it is a lesson for us, for we allow our habits totreat us in the same way. We should make habits our prisoners rather than ourcaptors; hitching them to the chariot of our will, we should drive them insteadof letting them drag us. To be able to do whatever we know we should do, notmerely that which we whimsically want to do, is to be really free.Learn to discriminate in this New Year: examine every impulse that comes, to seeif it is the right thing for you to act on. And when your reason tells you to doa certain thing, let neither the fates nor the gods stand in your way. But ifyou find out that you are wrong, be able to change your mind. Some people are sostubborn, they do not want to admit they are wrong. But one should be guided byreason, not by blind will. If, after calmly reasoning, you make up your mindthat what you have set out to do is right, then nobody should be able to stopyou. If I had no job I would shake up the whole world until people would say,“Give him a job to keep him quiet!” (I do not say these things out of personalpride, but that you may learn from my experiences.)Work of any kind, if done in the right spirit, gives you victory over yourself.You may clean bathrooms, but if you do it with the thought of serving andhelping people, you are showing the right spirit of a man of God. The attitudewith which you work is what counts. Mental laziness and working unwillinglyspoil one. People often ask me, “How do you do so many things?” It is because Ido everything with the greatest pleasure and spirit of service. Inwardly I amall the time with God. And though I sleep very little I always feel fresh,because I perform my duties with the right attitude: that it is a privilege toserve.You must realize that you are a child of God. Make up your mind that you are notgoing to be run by that old habit-bound self. The temporary limitations andimperfections of the body and brain cannot hold you back; as soon as you givethe verdict and strongly will to be a new person, you will change.You have been a prisoner of your habits and it has not been good for you. It isbecause of wrong habits of thinking and acting in this and in other lives thatyour bodily kingdom yields now to invasions of disease, troubles, moods, andignorance. From now on you must say: “I am not the slave of the body. I am thedictator of my own kingdom. My thoughts are going to be exactly as I wish themto be.” Once you have changed your habits, you will say to yourself, “How simpleit was to do it! How unkind I have been to myself by not exchanging mysoul-stultifying habits for those that bring happiness.”Are You a Psychological Antique?Habit-bound people can best be described as psychological antiques. They are thesame, year in and year out. They say the same old things, do the same oldthings. Converse with them just a little while and you can anticipate exactlywhat their next remark will be. Take a look in the mirror of introspection andsee if you are a psychological antique. Most people are.But why should you be one? Change your habits. Cast out moods. Try to be betterevery day. Let people be able to say, “What a wonderful change has come overhim!”The man of Self-realization has achieved mastery over the old habit-dulled self.Recognizing such mastery in Jesus, the officers who had been sent by thePharisees to arrest him came away marveling instead at his assurance, saying,“Never man spake like this man.”3 [part0032.html#footnote-154] A master’s natureis infinite; it cannot be contained in the narrow confines of human conceptions.Every time I thought I had succeeded in categorizing my guru, Swami SriYukteswarji, I found him to be different, greater, nonclassifiable.Sometime you have to break the habit of attachment to the mortal body and getback to God. There is no alternative. You are a prodigal son here on earth. Yourinfinite nature must be rediscovered. You will never be happy so long as youremain habit-mired in ignorance of your eternal soul-nature. It does not matterwho you are; the only way you can find lasting joy is to go back to God. You donot have to leave earth’s shores and put on wings; you must learn rather to behappy here and now, under all conditions; and to include others’ happiness inyour own joy. Go out of your way to make others happy. You cannot pleaseeverybody, but to those souls who cross your path, give kindness and love. Thereis no more liberating action than sincerely to give people kindness in returnfor unkindness. Why not be like a flower that gives fragrance even when crushedin the hand? The Gita teaches: “He who is free from hatred toward all creatures,is friendly and kind to all...is dear to Me.”4 [part0032.html#footnote-153]If people criticize you, do not ignore them. See if you have the fault theyascribe to you, and if you do, silently correct your error. But it is seldomnecessary to confess your faults to others; often it is unwise. Should theybecome angry with you, they might unkindly hold your confession over your headas a threat. To a God-realized spiritual teacher or guru you can tell yourfaults, but not to someone who cannot help you, and who might instead hurt youby broadcasting your flaws to others.A Stream of Divine PowerLearn to mix with good people. The faces of many of you who come here havebecome more spiritual. And the more you are in tune with me and refrain fromfussing about little things, the better you will be. A steady stream of divinepower will flow to you, for the Great Ones sent me here. When I am gone you willrealize this truth with greater impact. I am here only to deliver their message.Little by little a spiritual change will come to the true followers of thispath, and their influence will spread over the world. Self-Realization is one ofthe greatest spiritual movements ever sent to help mankind. It has been blessedby the Great Ones—Mahavatar Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, Sri Yukteswar—in communionwith Christ and Krishna. The grace of these masters is not gone from the earth.They are waiting to help you and to help the world, but they can work onlythrough the free choice of man. The world has gone mad with hate and war, butJesus’ way of brotherly love is the solution to the world’s problems. We canmake this world proof against war by following his teachings as he meant us to.On this last meditation day,5 [part0032.html#footnote-152] Christ came to meseveral times: first as a little child, then as a grown man, and finally as helooked before his crucifixion. I had been thinking that I would have to meditatelong, before he would come to me. And he surprised me! God was showing methrough this experience that no further effort is needed once you have convincedHim that you want Him more than all the gifts of the world. Then He takes awaythe screen of mystery and comes to you as Christ or Krishna, or Babaji, or asany great incarnation in whose form you desire to behold Him.Make up your mind that in this New Year you are going to be more Christlike inyour behavior. You must make the effort now. You must meditate more.Self-Realization Fellowship was not brought into existence merely to giveglimpses of God through words, but that you might know Him through your ownexperience. We teach that true fellowship with man can come only after one hasgained experience of God. If you contact God within yourself, you will know thatHe is in everyone, that He has become the children of all races. Then you cannotbe an enemy to anyone. If the whole world could love with that universal lovethere would be no need for men to arm themselves against one another. By our ownChristlike example we must bring unity among all religions, all nations, allraces.We must train ourselves to plain living and high thinking. It would be good ifeach family had a small garden in which to grow some of their food. Live moresimply, so that you can find time to enjoy the little pleasures of life. Manraces through his span, working, eating, sleeping; and that is about all heaccomplishes. Eliminate any habit or activity that disturbs your mental peaceand happiness.In this New Year, resolve to cast out from the temple of your mind all thedevils of bad habits; to plan your life so that you can do all the things youwant to do. If it is happiness you want, have it! There is nothing that can stopyou. You are an immortal child of God, and all the difficulties that visit youare meant only to stimulate you to higher achievements.The Best Resolution—Give More Time to GodChoose which habits you are going to destroy in the New Year. Make up your mindabout them and stick to your decision. Resolve to give more time to God: tomeditate regularly every day, and on one night each week to meditate severalhours, so that you can feel your spiritual progress in God. Resolve that you aregoing to practice Kriya Yoga regularly and that you are going to control yourappetites and emotions. Be a master! Make up your mind strongly now.Think of the good resolutions you have made in the past—that you were not goingto be dictated to by your old habits and thoughts. But have you kept them? It isan insult to your soul and to God to give in to your weaknesses. Be master ofyourself, captain of your destiny. Danger and you were born together, and youare the elder brother, more dangerous than danger! Do not lose the courage anddetermination that you feel as you listen to me now. Pray with me:“Heavenly Father, give us the strength to carry out all our good resolutions inthe New Year. May we always please Thee by our actions. Our spirits are willing.Help us to materialize all our worthy wishes in the New Year. We will reason, wewill will, we will act; but guide Thou our reason, will, and activity to theright thing that we should do in everything. Aum. Peace. Amen.”[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0032.html#footnote-156-backlink] Autobiography of a Yogi.2 [part0032.html#footnote-155-backlink] Swami Ram Tirtha.3 [part0032.html#footnote-154-backlink] John 7:46.4 [part0032.html#footnote-153-backlink] Bhagavad Gita XII:13–14.5 [part0032.html#footnote-152-backlink] The annual Self-Realization Fellowshipall-day Christmas meditation.

That ishow he obstructs God. The Lord could easily destroy Satan, but prefers toovercome him by love. Whenever we choose the divine offerings of eternal joyinstead of the passing pleasures of the senses, the Adversary is robbed of hisdark power. So it is up to us to cooperate with our Heavenly Father, that theDevil may be vanquished.Whenever you are slothful and careless, you help Satan to pull you toward hisside. Jesus prayed: “Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.”1[part0033.html#footnote-163] Temptation is not our own creation; it belongs tothe world of maya, and all men are subject to it. But to enable us to freeourselves, God gave us reason, conscience, and will power.To give our approval to sinful activities is to find ourselves in trouble. Whenby our wrong thoughts we fall into the pit of error, we should pray: “Father,leave us not here, but pull us out through the force of our reason and will. Andwhen we are out, if it is Thy will to test us further, first make Thyself knownto us—that we may realize that Thou art more tempting than temptation.”So long as you feel unwilling to deny yourself some particular pleasure that isdetrimental to your welfare, you are in the region of Satan; the evil results ofsuccumbing to harmful sense lures will at one time or another overtake you. Butif you are convinced that temptation is dangerous to you because it promiseshappiness and in the end gives sorrow, you can outwit the Devil.Why Sense Experiences Are AlluringTemptations are alluring; there is no doubt about that. Our sensory powers areall directed to the outer world. There is a current of life energy flowing fromthe brain through the nerves into the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin. Thesensations we experience through these instruments are the result of thisoutward-flowing current, and we tend to like the feeling. That is the appeal ofthe senses. Overindulging them is dangerous; until a man is established inwisdom, the outgoing energy leads him into sense bondage.By the five-rayed searchlight of the senses, we perceive and explore the worldof matter. Through the senses we learn to like things that are pleasing to see,hear, smell, taste, and touch. The desire for a particular sensation becomes ahabit. The trouble is, most people have not had any experience of the Spirit,which is hidden behind matter; hence they have no standard of comparison betweenthe exciting, pleasurable perceptions of the senses and the unknown ineffablebliss of the soul. And there is no chance to compare until one has renounced orbecome mentally insusceptible to all sense enticements. The only way to avoidthe trap is to realize by reason or experience that there are higher joys.Habit Is a Pitiless DictatorCommandments to refrain from harmful experiences are generally futile. Wheneveryou order a person not to do something, he immediately wants to do it. The tasteof forbidden fruits is sweet in the beginning, but in the end, bitter. Yet nomatter how much suffering people experience, they go on doing the sameself-harming things. Once you have established a liking for a certain sensoryexperience, the habit sits like a dictator in the brain and commands you toindulge yourself, even though it is against your best interests. You don’t wantto repeat an act, and yet you do it. Try never to let yourself reach a pointwhere you become such a victim of wrong habits. You must be the master ofyourself; do not let any habit control you. Whenever the desire for a particularsensory experience becomes habitual, it is time to stop that practice.I used to be fond of ginger ale because it reminded me of our lemonade in India.Some students arranged to have this beverage on hand for me wherever I went. Oneday I found my supply was all gone, and I missed it. “Mr. Ginger Ale,” I said,“you have gone too far, and I hadn’t even realized it! Goodbye.” The next day Ipurposely drank a little ginger ale as a test, and it tasted terrible. Mythought of the previous day had been so strong that the desire was banishedimmediately.I never miss anything that is taken away from me or that I voluntarily give up.No physical comfort can bind me. I have tried it out. You must be able to passthrough all experiences of life without attachment. Lord Krishna said: “The manof self-control, roaming among material objects with subjugated senses, anddevoid of attraction and repulsion, attains an unshakable inner calmness.”2[part0033.html#footnote-162] Any time you have to have something—a soft bed, apillow, or whatever—remember that you are putting yourself into slavery; andwhen your will and discrimination are held captive by binding sense attachments,you will lose the infinite kingdom of God. Jesus is still enjoying thetranscendental ecstasy that he experienced when he resurrected himself in theLord. But those who exist in ignorance, subject to the pressures of desires,will continue that way life after life until they resist worldly seductions.You should be careful not to let anything hurt your true happiness. Corrodingemotions of anger, greed, and jealousy, and overstimulation by sex, alcohol, ordrugs are extremely detrimental to you, for they prevent the realization of souljoy. Never abuse the sensory powers by overindulgence, if you would be reallyhappy. “Ever fed, never satisfied; never fed, ever satisfied” is a true axiomabout unwholesome sense experiences.Wisdom Is Man’s Best ProtectionProtect yourself within the fortress of wisdom. There is no greater safety.Complete understanding will bring you to a point where nothing can hurt you. Butuntil you have attained wisdom, when temptation comes you must first stop theaction or urge, and then reason. If you try to reason first, you will becompelled in spite of yourself to do the thing that you don’t want to do,because temptation will overcome all reason. Just say “No!” and get up and goaway. That is the surest way to escape the Devil. The more you develop this“won’t” power during the intrusion of temptation, the happier you will be; forall joy depends on the ability to do that which conscience tells you you shoulddo.Don’t let your environment and sensory desires control you. Virtue and spiritualliving are far more charming than sensual indulgence, but the habit chains oftemptation hold people fast. If the Lord once tempted you with His love, youwould want nothing more. Nothing else would interest you. When you are convincedthat He is the most desirable Treasure, nothing on the material plane can everagain tempt you and overcome your power of discrimination.To know God is the only worthwhile ambition to have, because He is happinesseverlasting. We should want Him because He is the panacea for all our suffering.He is the answer to all our needs. The very things that our hearts cry for—love,fame, wisdom, everything else—we find in communion with that Complete One. Evenif you are the most famous man in the world, death will be the end of yourawareness of fame; you will not know then that people adore you. But Jesus isaware that his devotees love him; because his consciousness is one with theconsciousness of God manifesting throughout creation, the Christ Intelligence,omnipresent, omniscient, ever living.So why strive hard to have something you will lose just as you cross the portalsof the grave? Money, fame, prestige, sense indulgence, material comfort—theseare all pseudo pleasures, offered by Satan in place of the real joy of divinecommunion. Remember that temptation is powerful only because you have no senseof comparison with anything better. When you are strongly tempted, your wisdomis momentarily a prisoner of your desires and habits. But the highest way tofreedom is to be so merged in the inexhaustible joy of God that you are able torelinquish all worldly pleasures in an instant.If you find true joy in this life, you will have it now and in the afterlifetoo. Which do you want: God’s eternal bliss, which may be yours by denyingyourself a few pleasures now? or worldly happiness now, which will not last?Convince your heart by comparison. Every effort that you make to climb upwardwill be recognized by God.Even If You Are the Greatest Sinner, Forget ItDon’t think of yourself as a sinner. You are a child of the Heavenly Father. Nomatter if you are the greatest sinner, forget it. If you have made up your mindto be good, then you are no longer a sinner. “Even a consummate evildoer whoturns away from all else to worship Me exclusively may be counted among thegood, because of his righteous resolve. He will fast become a virtuous man andobtain unending peace. Tell all assuredly, O Arjuna, that My devotee neverperishes!”3 [part0033.html#footnote-161] Start with a clean slate and say: “Ihave always been good; I was only dreaming that I was bad.” It is true: evil isa nightmare and does not belong to the soul.Temptation is sugarcoated poison; it tastes delicious, but death is certain. Thehappiness that people look for in this world does not endure. Divine joy iseternal. Yearn for that which is lasting, and be hardhearted about rejecting theimpermanent pleasures of life. You have to be that way. Don’t let the world ruleyou. Never forget that the Lord is the only reality. The real love of yourCosmic Father is playing hide-and-seek with you in your heart. Your truehappiness lies in your experience of Him.Man is sunk in a dream of ignorance, imagining that he is suffering with illnessand sorrow and poverty. Once when King Janaka, a great Indian saint, was deep inprayer, he suddenly exclaimed, “Who is in my temple today? I thought it wasmyself, but I see the Eternal is there. And the little self, this body-bundle ofbones, is not I. It is the Infinite that is in my body. I bow to Myself. I offerflowers to Myself.” Someday that realization will come to you, and you will nolonger think you are a mortal, a man or a woman; you will know that you are asoul, made in the divine image, “and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you.”4[part0033.html#footnote-160]The soul is bound to the body by a chain of desires, temptations, troubles, andworries, and it is trying to free itself. If you keep tugging at that chainwhich is holding you to mortal consciousness, someday an invisible Divine Handwill intervene and snap it apart, and you will be free.Protect yourself against temptation and sorrow by reason and by communion withGod. In the Bhagavad Gita the Lord says: “The ignorant, oblivious of Mytranscendental nature as the Maker of all creatures, discount also My presencewithin the human form.”5 [part0033.html#footnote-159] Meditation is simplyreminding yourself again and again that you are not the limited physical body,but the Infinite Spirit. Meditation is arousing the memory of your real Self andforgetting what you imagine you are. If a drunken prince goes into the slumsand, forgetting entirely his true identity, begins lamenting, “How poor I am,”his friends will laugh at him and say, “Wake up, and remember that you are aprince.”You have been likewise in a state of hallucination, thinking you are a helplessmortal, struggling and miserable. Every day you should sit quietly and affirm,with deep conviction: “No birth, no death, no caste have I; father, mother, haveI none. Blessed Spirit, I am He.6 [part0033.html#footnote-158] I am the InfiniteHappiness.” If you again and again repeat these thoughts, day and night, youwill eventually realize what you really are: an immortal soul.Fix Your Mind in the Divine Consciousness of MeditationTemptation, greed, attachment to people and possessions, slavery to the senses,ignorance of your Spirit-nature, idleness, and mechanical living are the worstenemies of your happiness. Be busy working, with your mind fixed in the divineconsciousness that is cultivated by meditation, for then you will be reallyhappy and you will be really living.When I started meditating, I could not imagine that I would ever find such joyin it. But as time went on, the more I meditated, the greater became my peaceand bliss.If you are getting tired of the life you are leading, and yet you go on fillingit with more possessions and more desires for new experiences, you are on thewrong road. The surest way to avoid temptation is to lead a natural life: a lifein harmony with God. Don’t lead an unnatural existence, restlessly seekinghappiness from a world that is powerless to bestow it. Life is too precious.Every day I pray to Him: “Take everything away from me if it is Your desire. Iam trying to do my best, Father, but know this for certain: above all I want toplease You. I will try to please others, too, but more than anything else I wantto please You.” When you pray like that you may suffer many tests of desires.But as you go on fighting wrong habits and tendencies, He begins gradually tocome upon you; finally you will see that like a great flood He has swept awayall your undesirable traits.Krishna said: “The man who physically fasts from sense objects finds that thesense objects fall away for a little while, leaving behind only the longing forthem. But he who beholds the Supreme is freed even from longings.”7[part0033.html#footnote-157] Banish all darkness by His light, and evil thoughtsby good thoughts. Eliminate temptation by discovering God’s superior attractionin meditation. That is the best weapon against temptation. Any time you feelthat your will is being overpowered, meditate until you feel the DivinePresence.[../images/00015.jpeg]1 [part0033.html#footnote-163-backlink] Matthew 6:13.2 [part0033.html#footnote-162-backlink] Bhagavad Gita II:64.3 [part0033.html#footnote-161-backlink] Bhagavad Gita IX:30–31.4 [part0033.html#footnote-160-backlink] I Corinthians 3:16.5 [part0033.html#footnote-159-backlink] IX:11.6 [part0033.html#footnote-158-backlink] From a famous song by Swami Shankara,peerless exponent of Vedic monism.

If he makes noeffort to curb his indulgence in liquors, he may become an alcoholic andhelplessly suffer from an overwhelming desire to drink without any limit,without rhyme or reason. Such unfortunate people often spend all their money ondrink; they eat very little and seem to get some nourishment from the liquoritself. The normal sense of responsibility toward maintaining good health and anhonorable standing in the family, society, and the world is lost. They mayeventually lose all sense of pride and be picked up dead drunk anywhere—in aditch, or in the middle of the street—exposed meanwhile to the dangers of beingrobbed or run over.The foregoing description of liquor alcoholics serves to illustrate what I meanby “mental alcoholics.” The latter may be individually classified according totheir particular psychological extreme, which might be chronic anger, fear, sex,sadism, gambling, stealing, jealousy, hate, greed, moods, craftiness, orstupidity.When from the very beginning of life a person displays extraordinary tantrums ofanger, fear, jealousy—or any other of the aforementioned characteristics—thenone may know that he has acquired those abnormal mental habits in a previousexistence.Parents who notice any such evil psychological tendencies in their child, evenin its infancy, should get busy and take some steps to prevent the child frombecoming a psychological alcoholic; if possible, by placing him in anotherenvironment under the good care of spiritual teachers.Through continued good company and proper environment for many years, a mentalalcoholic may become free from the octopus grip of the inborn evil. While themental alcoholic is receiving thoughtful care in a good environment, the evilconsequences of his bad habits should be explained to him, and he should beencouraged to reason with himself about them and to make a distinct effort notto display them under any circumstances. Each indulgence in a prenatallyacquired mental habit makes it stronger and stronger, until the possessorbecomes literally a slave to it.A False ConceptionThe angry man, the sexual man, the greedy man forgets his own position, and hisrelations with society, and commits great blunders that ruin his life and thelives of others. Many of these mental alcoholics think that if they giveexpression to their psychological habits, they will feel somewhat relieved. Butthe self-indulgent habit of giving in to harmful impulses is extremelypernicious, for it is by repetition of such evil expressions that a personbecomes a chronic mental alcoholic, making a fool of himself anytime andanywhere.If children are exposed to an evil environment while their minds are in aplastic state, they will develop wrong habits that, unchecked, may lead tochronic mental alcoholism. Parents who notice a sudden change in a child—perhapsa calm-natured boy suddenly turns into a repeatedly angry boy—should immediatelytake care of this. The causes of his frustrations should be determined andremoved, and new avenues for constructive use of his energies sought.Those who habitually display any of the foregoing traits are mental alcoholics.They recklessly ride down the Niagara Falls of continuous bad habits, smashingtheir happiness to pieces as they helplessly but willingly indulge inuncontrolled expression of their worst traits. It is not good to remonstratewith mental alcoholics who frequently display violent moods of disgust andboredom with the world. Their attitude is a result of their continuousrepetition of wrong habits. They should be treated as psychological patientssuffering from chronic mental diseases.Counteractive InfluencesA change of company is the best remedy for acute mental alcoholism of any kind,for the will of the mental alcoholic has become a slave to habit; hence he hasno resistance whatsoever to evil. The most effective cure is to move himimmediately to an environment that will be a specific antidote to his toxicmental condition.If possible, the angry mental alcoholic should be placed with one or moreindividuals who do not become angry, even under irritating circumstances. Thesexual person ought to be surrounded by self-controlled people; the habitualthief needs the society of honest people. The chronically timid can be helped byassociation with the brave, and by reading stories of men who were heroes. Moodyor scornful or “sourpuss” types should have the companionship of habituallycheerful people.A mental alcoholic should remember that poor elimination, and eating meat (beefand pork especially), will aggravate his psychological malady, fixing it evenmore firmly in his brain. An abundance of fruits and vegetables in the dailydiet, and each week a one-day fast on fruit juices—with a longer fastoccasionally—will greatly help to change the cerebral grooves that entrench thepernicious habits.Sexual excess impairs the nervous system and the brain cells, which in turnaggravates anger in a mental alcoholic. Overindulgence in sex destroys willpower, also. Hence all mental alcoholics should learn control over the seximpulse, that they may practice moderation in marital relations, as natureintended.Petty DictatorsOften we find that the breadwinners in a family—father or son or, sometimes,mother or daughter—display a tendency toward mental alcoholism because of theconsciousness that they are in a position to dictate. Such little dictators infamilies should not freely unload their moods on innocent, harmless dependents,and thus lose the inner respect of those around them. When a family dictatorthinks he can get away with doing what he pleases at home, he gradually beginsto do what he pleases in expressing unpleasant moods or evil traits outside thefamily. Eventually he does this anytime and anywhere. If petty family tyrantsdon’t check their indulgence in these sadistic habits, they gradually becomemental alcoholics, behaving immaturely and causing untold trouble to those whoare closely or even casually associated with them, as well as to themselves.If you are a mental alcoholic, try to cure yourself; but meanwhile refrain atleast from trying to infect or influence others. For whether or not you succeed,you will probably cause yourself added trouble. Think what pandemonium wouldbreak loose if suddenly somebody dropped a skunk in your peaceful home, whereyou had been sitting quietly meditating or reading a book by the fireplace. Youand those around you would no doubt try to evict the skunk, and in so doing bedrenched with its malodorous chemicals. Both the family and the skunk wouldsuffer.So it is not wise for a human skunk to enter an environment where he isunwanted. He is likely to cause trouble for everyone around him, and in the endmay suffer harsh treatment. Please remember that a human skunk carrying a mentalvibration of terrible moods, and the reflection of it on his face, createsincalculable harm in peaceful environments; this biped is unwanted anywhere.It is better even to hide mental alcoholism than to give in to its influence inpublic. Continued shameless indulgence is the soil in which prenatal orpostnatal tendencies thrive. The individual who is prenatally disposed to mentalalcoholism must be doubly careful not to live in an environment that waters theinnate psychological seeds of his bad habits or moods.Of course, when you meet a person who treats you formally, and with a galvanizedsmile says, “How do you do, I am awfully delighted to see you,” while inside heis thinking, “I could cheerfully chop off your head for disturbing me,” yousense his inner feeling and you don’t like it. I myself like to know where Istand with people. I prefer blunt treatment to hypocritical behavior. No onelikes to risk having the snake of insincerity dart out at him from under arosebush of smiles.However, it is better for a mental alcoholic to be friendly toward people, evenif hypocritically, than to vent on them his evil moods. Self-control practiceddaily, even in insignificant matters, will help the mental alcoholic to come outof his drunken indulgences little by little."},{"pageContent":"Overcoming Malignant MoodsFirst Self-Realization Fellowship Temple at Encinitas, California, March 5, 1939Moods are not easily defined; but you know what they are. When you are in amood, your behavior is not natural; you are not the person you should be. Theend result is that you feel wretched. And how foolish it is to be unhappythrough your own doing! Nobody likes misery. Why not analyze yourself next timeyou are in a mood? You will see how you are willingly, willfully making yourselfmiserable. And while you are doing so, others around you feel the unpleasantnessof your state of mind. Wherever you go, you tell about yourself withoutspeaking, because your whole mood carries its vibrations in your eyes, andanyone looking at you is aware of the negativity recorded there. Seeing the darkfeelings reflected in your eyes, others are repelled; they want to stay awayfrom those discomforting vibrations. You must remove moods from your mentalmirror before you can remove their reflection from your eyes.We Live in a Glass HouseYou are living in the glass house of this world, and everyone else is watchingyou. You cannot pose; you have to live a natural life. So why not behave in sucha way that others will look up to you? Why should they not see joy in your face?All your good qualities are covered up inside by your moodiness.Not only are others observing how you conduct yourself; you also are studyinghow they behave. Because you tend to make comparisons as a result of constantlywatching those around you, you fall into moods. Or you may become moody over theendless difficulties one encounters in this world. Moods are often a result ofenvironmental influences. Each one of us is affected in different ways by theworld about us. But you should not allow yourself to indulge in moods overexternal conditions. Why should you take on the effects of your environment?There are people who resort to moods in an attempt to avoid facing some problem.But moodiness is neither an escape nor an emotional safety valve. It is naturalnow and then to fall momentarily into a mood; but don’t hold on to it!Each type of mood has a specific cause, and it lies within your own mind. Toremove a mood you must remove its cause. One should introspect each day in orderto understand the nature of his mood, and how to correct it, if it is a harmfulone. Perhaps you find yourself in an indifferent state of mind. No matter whatis suggested, you are not interested. It is necessary then to make a consciouseffort to create some positive interest. Beware of indifference, which ossifiesyour progress in life by paralyzing your will power.Perhaps your mood is discouragement over sickness; a feeling that you will neverregain health. You must try to apply the laws of right living that lead to ahealthy, active, and moral life, and pray for greater faith in the healing powerof God.Or suppose your mood is a conviction that you are a failure, and can neversucceed at anything. Analyze the problem and see if you have really made all theeffort you could have. Consider the hard work of the president of the UnitedStates. He has to try to please all the forty-eight states,1[part0035.html#footnote-169] and other nations as well. We have to marvel thatit is possible for a man to understand so much and undertake so much. And asthere is such a difference between the working capacity of the ordinary man andthat of the president, how much greater the difference between that of thepresident and God, who is infinitely busier! God is managing the whole universe,down to the most minute detail—and we are made in His image. Therefore we cannotmake excuses for failure to succeed. Don’t be afraid of hard work; it has neverhurt anyone. However, one should learn to work—and to think—calmly. When you arecalmly active you can accomplish anything you set out to do, for the mind isclear.In addition to not working hard enough for success, most people are not mentallyactive enough. They spend too much time not thinking. It is considered to berelaxation. However, in true relaxation one is calmly active mentally; he mayreflect about God, or about a beautiful peaceful scene, or about some pleasantexperience. Calm, positive mental activity is revivifying. Yet many peoplewrongly associate creative effort with strain, and go about it with a tense,nervous attitude.Moods Get Their Grip on a Vacant MindCreative thinking is the best antidote for moods. Moods get their grip on yourconsciousness when you are in a negative or passive state of mind. The time whenyour mind is vacant is just the time it can become moody; and when you aremoody, the devil comes and wields his influence on you. Therefore, developcreative thinking. Whenever you are not active physically, do something creativein your mind. Keep it so busy that you have no time to indulge in moodiness.Creative thinking is marvelous—like living in another world. Everyone shoulddevelop this power. I think hardly a word of my lecture before I come here; butI get into the consciousness of my subject, and my soul begins to tell mewonderful things. When you are thinking creatively, you don’t feel the body ormoods; you become attuned with Spirit. Our human intelligence is made in theimage of His creative intelligence, through which all things are possible; andif we don’t live in that consciousness, we become a bundle of moods. By thinkingcreatively we destroy those moods; and by thinking creatively we will find allthe answers to our problems, and to the problems of others.Moods are like cancer—they eat into the peace of the soul. That is why the moodyman cannot rid himself of his troubles. Remember: no matter how wrong everythinghas gone for you, you have no right to be moody. In your mind you can be aconqueror. When bested, the moody man admits defeat. But the man whose mindremains unconquered, though the world be in cinders at his feet, is yet thevictor.Do you want to be a prisoner or a conqueror? By binding yourself so tightly inmoods, you render yourself incapable of going on with the battle of life. Assoon as you allow a mood to enwrap your mind, your will becomes paralyzed. Moodsbefog the brain, and hence impair judgment, so that your efforts are wasted.Moods Are the Brakes on Your Wheels of ProgressYou can conquer your moods, no matter how terrible they seem. Make up your mindthat you are not going to be moody anymore; and if a mood comes in spite of yourresolve, analyze the cause that brought it on, and do something constructiveabout it. Don’t go on doing things in a state of indifference, if that is yourattitude, for indifference is the worst of all moods. At such times, remindyourself that you are not your own creator; God created you, and He is runningthis universe for you. Whatever your work, do it enthusiastically, for Him. Busyyourself in creative activities, for He has given you infinite power. How dareyou make yourself a mental failure by indulgence in the intoxicant of moodiness!Free yourself from these devastating mental states. They are the real brakes onthe wheels of your progress. Until you release them, you cannot move on. Everymorning, remind yourself that you are God’s child, and that no matter what thedifficulties, you have the power to overcome them. Heir to the cosmic power ofSpirit, you are more dangerous than danger!An intelligent boy does not care to work on simple problems; he enjoys thechallenge of difficult ones. But many people are afraid of life’s problems. Ihave never feared them, for I have always prayed: “Lord, may Thy power increasein me. Keep me in the positive consciousness that with Thy help I can alwaysovercome my difficulties.” Think constructively about a problem till you cannotthink anymore. When I am solving a problem, I go to the nth degree to cover allpossible steps toward its solution, until I can honestly say: “I have done mybest, and that is all I can do.” Then I forget it.A person who keeps the worry of a problem in his consciousness becomes moody.Avoid that. When a problem comes up, instead of dwelling on it, think of everypossible avenue of action to rid yourself of it. If you are unable to think,compare your particular trouble with others’ similar troubles, and from theirexperiences learn which ways lead to failure and which ways lead to success.Choose those steps that seem logical and practical, and then get busyimplementing them. The whole library of the universe is hidden within you. Allthe things you want to know are within yourself. To bring them out, thinkcreatively.Magical Effect of Sincere LoveMoods blunt one’s feelings and understanding, making it impossible to get alongwith others. Domestic life should be a temple of heaven, but moods can make it ahades. A husband comes home and finds his wife in a sullen mood, and he can’treason with her. Or he returns from work in a nasty mood, and she can’t reasonwith him. So much trouble comes to people because of moods!When someone else in your family is seething with anger, or is whollyindifferent, you are affected immediately by his mood. Or perhaps you go tosomeone in great joy, but he is moody and quarrelsome, and finally he gives youa slap. Immediately your joy vanishes, and you want to retaliate. Do not put onthe mood of another. The Bible tells us that if anyone smites us on the leftcheek, we should turn the right cheek. How many do that? More often, the personslapped wants to give his assailant twelve slaps in reprisal—and perhaps a kick,or even a bullet! It is easy to strike back, but to give love is the highest wayto try to disarm your persecutor. Even if it doesn’t work at the time, he willnever be able to forget that when he gave you a slap, you gave love in return.That love must be sincere; when it comes from the heart, love is magical. Youshould not look for the effects; even if your love is spurned, pay no attention.Give love and forget. Don’t expect anything; then you will see the magicalresult.Do you realize that within you, in your soul, is a superb garden? a wondrousgarden of thoughts, fragrant with love, goodness, understanding, and peace, andmore beautiful than any earthly flowers that grow. You cultivated a fragrantblossom whenever someone in anger misunderstood you and you continuously gavelove to him. Isn’t the aroma of that love and understanding more lasting thanthat of any rose? So always think of your mind as a garden, and keep itbeautiful and fragrant with divine thoughts; let it not become a mud pond, rankwith malodorous hateful moods. If you cultivate the heavenly scented blooms ofpeace and love, the bee of Christ Consciousness2 [part0035.html#footnote-168]will steal into your garden. As the bee seeks out only those flowers that aresweet with honey, so God comes only when your life is sweet with honeyedthoughts. Resolve that in your garden of good soul qualities you will not allowthe evil stinkweed of anger to grow. The more you develop flowerlike divinequalities, the more God will reveal to you His secret omnipresence in your soul.“He who is tranquil before friend and foe alike, and in encountering adorationand insult, and during the experiences of warmth and chill and of pleasure andsuffering...that person is dear to Me.”3 [part0035.html#footnote-167] Bycontinuously giving love to those who are unkind, peace to those who areharassed by worries, sweetness to those who are bitter, joy to those who areladen with miseries; and by constantly setting a better example for those whofollow the path of error, you destroy moods by keeping the mind creatively busy.If you can’t be busy outwardly, be constructively busy inwardly.Live in a World of WonderI often say: If you read for one hour, write for two hours; and if you write fortwo hours, think for three hours; and if you think for three hours, meditate allthe time. God is the repository of all happiness; and you can contact Him ineveryday life. Yet man mostly occupies himself in pursuits that lead tounhappiness. Meditation is the best way to destroy moods and live in a world ofwonder—a world such as Narada, a great rishi, knew when he said: “Lord, I wassinging Thy praises, and became lost in Thee. When I came back to thisconsciousness, I saw that I had slipped from my old body, and You had given me anew one!”A similar story is told in India about another saint. A young man had just died.His body had been carried to the cremation grounds and the mourners werepreparing to light the fire, when suddenly an old man came running, crying out,“Stop! Don’t do it, I will use that body.” As soon as he said this, the man’saged body dropped lifeless to the ground, and the young man got up from the pyreand ran off toward the forest. The old man was a great saint; he had simply notwished to interrupt his devotions by taking rebirth in an infant’s helplessbody.Fear Enters When God Is Shut Out of LifeThere are so many wondrous things to know about life and death, and meditationis the way. Learn to live in this world as a son of God. Death holds terror forman because he has left God out of his life. All painful things frighten us,because we love the world without understanding its mystery and purpose. Butwhen we behold everything as God, we have nothing to fear. We are constantly“born” in life as well as death. The word “death” is a great misnomer, for thereis no death; when you are tired of life, you simply take off the overcoat offlesh and go back to the astral world.4 [part0035.html#footnote-166]Death means an end. A car whose parts are worn out is dead; it has come to anend. And so at death the physical body comes to an end. But the immortal soulcannot be dead. Every night, in sleep, the soul lives without any consciousnessof the physical body; but it is not dead. Death is only a greater sleep, whereinthe soul lives in the astral body without the consciousness of the physicalbody. If loss of physical-body consciousness signified death for man, then thesoul would die when we go to sleep. But we are not dead when we are asleep; norare we completely unconscious, because when we awaken, we remember whether weslept well or not. So, in the after-state of death we do not die.Those who allow their minds to ossify are truly dying. To solve the mystery oflife you must be born anew every day. This means you must strive daily toimprove yourself in some way. Above all, pray for wisdom, because with wisdomeverything else comes. Be controlled not by moods, but by wisdom. And with thatwisdom, develop creative thinking and activity. Keep busy doing constructivethings for your own self-improvement and for the benefit of others, for whoeverwould enter God’s kingdom must try also to do good for others every day. If youfollow this pattern, you will feel the mood-dispelling joy of knowing you areadvancing, mentally, physically, and spiritually. You will surely reach God, forthat way leads to the kingdom of heaven.Strive continuously to overcome moods; for as soon as you feel moody, you arecultivating seeds of error in the soil of your soul. To indulge in moods is todie gradually; but if you try daily to be cheerful in spite of any upsettingexperiences, you will have a new birth. Until this human birth becomestransmuted into a highly spiritual birth, you cannot be “born again”5[part0035.html#footnote-165] in God.Moods are “catching,” and at times of general depression can affect largenumbers of people. Man should not take life’s unhappy incidents so seriously. Itis better to laugh a little than to make a tragedy of every misfortune. The Gitateaches: “He who feels neither rejoicing nor loathing toward the glad nor thesad (aspects of phenomenal life), who is free from grief and cravings, who hasbanished the relative consciousness of good and evil, and who is intentlydevout—he is dear to Me.”6 [part0035.html#footnote-164] To have an optimisticdisposition and try to smile is constructive and worthwhile; for whenever youexpress divine qualities, such as courage and joy, you are being born again;your consciousness is being made new by the manifestation of your true soulnature. This is the spiritual rebirth that enables you to “see the kingdom ofGod.”[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0035.html#footnote-169-backlink] Alaska and Hawaii were not yet states atthe time Paramahansaji made this observation.

But what about the skeptics and the atheists? Can the truth ofreincarnation be scientifically proven to their satisfaction? Can the theory ofreincarnation be in any way scientifically experimented with, so as to furnishnot only hope, but actual proof, of its reality?Material scientists claim that they have not found any actual proof of theexistence of a God, and hence cannot offer any proof of the existence of Hisjust law, giving equal opportunity to all life to improve through reincarnation.To such scientists, the sufferings of innocent babies and other inequities oflife seem inexplicable, and point to the absence of a just Creator.Scientific LawOn the other hand, most of those who do believe in a just God base theirconvictions on belief only, and have no scientific proof to offer tounbelievers. They do not dare, for the most part, to scrutinize or deeplyquestion their faith, for fear of losing it or of creating some socialinharmony. They are not aware, in other words, of the existence of a scientificspiritual law that can prove their beliefs to be truth.But why should not spiritual law be investigated by the same methods ofexperimentation used by the material scientist to discover physical truths? Thisquestion was asked centuries ago by the Hindu savants, and they set about thetask of answering it. Their experiments resulted in scientific methods that canbe followed by anyone to discover the reality of spiritual law, and hence ofreincarnation and every other great cosmic truth.Since the means of proof do exist, no one has a right to say that reincarnationand other spiritual laws do not operate, until he has tried the methods and seenthe results for himself. A doubting physical scientist is entitled to expresshis opinion, but it remains an opinion only, not a fact. In physical science,certain procedures must be adopted and followed in order to prove the truth ofany given theory. Germs are not visible to the naked eye; one must use amicroscope to detect their presence. If a person refuses to look through themicroscope, he cannot be said to have scientifically tested the theory thatgerms are present. His opinion is therefore valueless, since he has not followedthe prescribed rules for arriving at the truth of the theory. So it is inspiritual matters. The method has been discovered, the rules laid down, and theresult is open to anyone who is interested enough to experiment. In the Westernworld, owing to lack of this scientific approach to spiritual law, the value ofreligion has been greatly diminished as a vital factor in the life of man, andspiritual doctrines are believed in or rejected simply on the grounds ofpersonal bias, rather than as a result of scientific investigation.How Were the Spiritual Laws Discovered?How did the spiritual scientists (rishis) of ancient India discover theseunalterable cosmic laws? Through experiment on the life and thought of man, inthe laboratories of their hermitages. To find the truth of physical things, wemust experiment with physical substances. So, to find the truth ofreincarnation, or the passage of the same soul through many bodies, it isnecessary to experiment upon the consciousness of man. These scientists of oldfound that the human ego persists through all changes of experience and thoughtduring the states of wakefulness, dream, and dreamless sleep during one’slifetime. The cognitive experiences changed, the environment, sensations,thoughts, and bodily states changed, but the sense of identity, of “I,” did notchange from birth to death. The Hindu experimentalists argued that throughconcentration on the self, through a constant, conscious, aloof, unidentifiedintrospection or watching of the various changing states of life—of wakefulness,dreaming, or dreamless sleep—that one could perceive the changeless and eternalnature of the self. Ordinarily, one is conscious of his waking state, andsometimes he is conscious also of his dreaming state. It is not uncommon, duringa dream, for a person to be aware that he is dreaming. Through certain methodsand practices, one can maintain conscious awareness during every state of hisbeing: wakefulness, dreaming, dreamless sleep, and turiya, “deep sleep,” theever awake superconsciousness (the unrestricted region of mind) beyond dreamlesssubconsciousness.Relaxation in SleepDuring sleep, there is involuntary relaxation of energy from the motor andsensory nerves. Through practice, one can produce this relaxation during thewaking state also, at will. In the big sleep of death, there is totalrelaxation—the retirement of energy from the heart and cerebrospinal axis. Bydeep meditation, this complete relaxation may be produced consciously in thewaking state. In other words, every involuntary function may be accomplishedvoluntarily and consciously by practice.The rishis of ancient India analyzed death as the withdrawal of the electricityof life from the bulb of human flesh with its wires of sensory and motor nervesthat lead to the different channels of outward expression. Just as electricitydoes not die when it is withdrawn from a broken bulb, so life energy is notannihilated when it retires from the involuntary nerves. Energy cannot die. Itwithdraws, upon the occasion of death, into the Cosmic Energy.Current WithdrawnIn sleep, the conscious mind ceases to operate—the current is temporarilywithdrawn from the nerves. In death, the human consciousness permanently ceasesto express itself through the body; it is as though one had a paralyzed arm—heis mentally conscious of that arm, but cannot function through it. Medicalrecords describe the case of a clergyman who once fell into a state of suspendedanimation. He heard everyone around bewailing his apparent death, but could notexpress his awareness through his physical organs. His body motor had “stalled”and refused to respond to his mental commands. After he had passed twenty-fourhours in this state, and was about to be taken away for burial, he made asupreme effort and was able to move. This instance illustrates the constancy ofthe awareness of “I-ness” or personal identity, even though the body isseemingly lifeless.The rishis taught that one must learn to separate the energy and consciousnessfrom the body, consciously. One must consciously watch the state of sleep, andmust practice conscious voluntary withdrawal of energy from the heart and spinalregions. Thus he learns to do consciously what death will otherwise force uponhim unconsciously and unwillingly.1 [part0036.html#footnote-172]An Amazing CaseThere is a case on record, in the files of French and other European doctors, ofa man named Sadhu Haridas—in the court of Emperor Ranjit Singh of India—who wasable to separate his energy and consciousness from his body and then connect thetwo again after several months. His body was buried underground and watch waskept over the spot, day and night, for months. At the end of this time, his bodywas exhumed and examined by the European doctors, who pronounced him dead. Aftera few minutes, however, he opened his eyes and regained control over all thefunctions of his body; and lived for many years more. He had learned, bypractice, how to control all the involuntary functions of his body and mind. Hewas a spiritual scientist who experimented with prescribed methods for learningthe truth of cosmic law. As a result he was in a position to demonstrate thetruth of the theory of the changelessness of personal identity and the eternalnature of the life principle.Those who want to prove for themselves the scientific truth of the doctrine ofreincarnation should first prove the principle of continuity of consciousnessafter death by learning the art of consciously separating the soul from thebody.2 [part0036.html#footnote-171] This can be done by following the rules laiddown many centuries ago by the Hindu savants: Learn (1) to be conscious duringsleep, (2) to be able to produce dreams at will, (3) to disconnect the fivesenses consciously, not passively as during sleep, and (4) to control the actionof the heart, which is to experience conscious death, or the suspended animationof the body (but not of the consciousness) that occurs during the higher statesof superconsciousness.Follow the PracticesBhagavan Krishna taught: “The ego is continuously conscious of itself inchildhood, youth, and old age; the embodied soul is uninterruptedly consciousnot only of these states but also of attaining another body after death (in thelong series of ‘lives’ and ‘deaths’ that are the ego’s alternations between thephysical and astral worlds).”3 [part0036.html#footnote-170]By following the practices that lead to the four states outlined above, we canfollow the ego in all states of existence—we can follow it consciously throughdeath, through space, to other bodies or other worlds. Those who do not learnthese things cannot retain their sense of personal identity, of awareness orconsciousness, during the big sleep of death, and hence cannot remember anyprevious state, or even the “deep sleep” states during one life.By adopting the methods of the ancient Hindu scientists who experimented withsuch laws, and who thereby gave the world a knowledge that is priceless anddemonstrable, one may come to know the scientific truth of reincarnation and allother eternal verities.[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0036.html#footnote-172-backlink] The life energy enters the body at themedulla, is stored in the reservoir of the cerebrum, and then descends into fiveother centers of life and consciousness in the spine, whence it is distributedto the organs of sensory perceptions and to all other parts of the body. Atdeath, the life energy retires irrevocably into the spine and leaves the bodythrough the medulla. The accomplished yogi can voluntarily and consciouslywithdraw the life energy from the body and senses into the spine, directing itupward to the highest centers of divine perceptions, where he is joyously awareof being “dead”—freed from sensory delusions of being limited to a purelyphysical existence.2 [part0036.html#footnote-171-backlink] The Christian mystic St. Paul understoodand demonstrated this mastery of life and death; he declared: “...I die daily”(I Corinthians 15:31).3 [part0036.html#footnote-170-backlink] Bhagavad Gita II:13."},{"pageContent":"Reincarnation: The Soul’s Journey to PerfectionSelf-Realization Fellowship Temple, Hollywood, California, February 20, 1944Reincarnation is the progress of a soul through many lives on the earth plane,as through so many grades in a school, before it “graduates” to the immortalperfection of oneness with God. Souls that are living in an imperfect state(unaware of their divine identity with Spirit) do not, upon the death of thephysical body, automatically enter a state of God-realization. We are made inthe image of God, but by identification with the physical body, we have put onits imperfections and limitations. Until this imperfect human consciousness ofmortality is removed, we cannot become gods again.A prince ran away from his palatial home and sought shelter in a slum. As aresult of intoxication and of mixing with persons of bad character, he graduallylost sight of his true identity. Not until his father found him and took himhome to the palace did he remember that he was actually a prince.Similarly, we are all children of the King of the Universe who have run awayfrom our spiritual home. We have kept ourselves locked up in human bodies for solong that we have forgotten our divine heritage. As often as we have come onearth we have developed new imperfections and new desires. So we come back hereagain and again until we fulfill all desires; or until, through increase ofwisdom, we banish those desires. We must satisfy our desires, or, by cultivatingwisdom, do away with them altogether. Very few persons get off the wheel ofbirth and death by trying to satisfy their desires, however; it is the nature ofdesire that each time one “satisfies” it, the craving to repeat the experiencesimply increases its hold, unless one’s mind is very strong.1[part0037.html#footnote-177]It is better to satisfy small or unimportant desires, because in that way we canget rid of them. But it is necessary to do so with wisdom and discrimination;otherwise even small desires may come back in a stronger way, reinforced byexperience. People who feel a desire to drink, for example, often “reason” thus:“I will have all I want today, and tomorrow I will do without.” After severalrepetitions of this experience, the usual result is that they find they haveinstilled a habit, and then it is difficult to get rid of it. The same thing mayhappen with any other desire.God is not a dictator who has sent us here and is telling us what to do. He hasgiven us free will to do as we please. We hear a great deal about the importanceof being good. But if we all go straight to heaven when we die (as some claim),what is the point in trying to do good while we are here? If there is the samereward for everyone at the end of life, why not be a greedy, selfish person,since the path of evil is often the easiest one to take? There would be no usein emulating the lives of great saints if when we die we all—the good and thebad alike—become angels.On the other hand, if God has it in His plan for us all to go to Hades, againthere would be no use in worrying about how we behave in this life. And wouldthere be any value in watching one’s actions if our lives are likeautomobiles—once they become old they are cast on the junk pile and that is theend of them? If that is all there is to man’s life there is no point in readingthe scriptures or in exercising self-control.The Importance of TimeIf, however, there is a lofty purpose in living, how may we explain the seeminginjustice in a baby’s being born dead? What about those who are born blind ordumb or crippled; or who live only a few years and then die? Only the one wholives long has time to struggle against innate wrong tendencies and desires, andto try to be good. If there is no other chance (in a future life) for the littlechild who dies at six months, why did God give that child a mind and no time inwhich to develop the potentialities of that mind? The time element is mostimportant in our progress. One life-span only may not afford sufficient time.If a child dies early in life, there is a reason for that death; and because hedid not have enough time in which to express his potential, human or divine, hewill be given another opportunity in which to do so. Such a person is like a boywho is sick and cannot go to school. The boy does not leave school forever; assoon as he is well he goes back to school to start his lessons where he leftoff. So it is with life. If we don’t have a chance to learn our lessons in thislife, we shall have opportunities to learn them in some other.When you can see “behind the scenes” you will realize that life on earth is apuppet show. It seems real to us now, but what we are experiencing at thismoment will have a dreamlike unreality to us a few years hence. And what we areexperiencing now would have seemed unreal to us five years ago, had it beendescribed to us then. Last Sunday most of you sat in other seats in the temple,and had other thoughts in your mind. Today we are seeing a different “pictureshow.” Reflect on how many people you have known who are now vanished from thisearthly stage.The concept of life as a changing, passing show is not pessimistic; it shouldteach us not to take life seriously at all. Maya, cosmic delusion, makes us feelthat the body is so real, such a necessary part of our being. Yet in a momentthe body may be taken away from the soul by death, and the separation is notpainful at all. When that “operation” is over, you have no need of time, dress,food, or shelter, for you no longer have to carry this bodily bundle of flesh.You are free of it. And you are still you. Have you ever sought to reason outwhy this truth is hidden? Or where may be now the millions of people who havegone away from our earth? Have you ever wondered if we are like so many chickensin a coop—when we are gone from the coop we are replaced by another flock? Isthere no way to find out?How We Live This Life Determines What We Are in the NextWe have been given the power to reason out where we go and whence we have come.But we don’t take enough pains to analyze ourselves and our lives. Otherwise ourcommon sense would tell us that whatever our character is today it will continueto be after death—perhaps a little better or a little worse, depending on howmuch effort we are making to improve ourselves. You go along 365 days a year,year after year, and perhaps you have made some progress; but your nature willbe the same after death as it was before death. You will not become an angeljust because you die! Only the body changes. Death makes no difference,otherwise. Death is like a gate you will pass through. Your body will be gonebut you will be in every other respect the same. If you have a violent temper,you will not leave it behind, at death, with your physical body. Your violenttemper will remain with you until you conquer it. If in your present life youhave observed the laws of healthful living, in your next incarnation you willpossess a healthy body. The last portion of life is more important than thefirst, because what you are at the end of this life is what you will be at thebeginning of the next.The first part of life is usually stupidly misspent, in a sort of bewilderedstate. Then romance comes, and finally disease and old age; the struggle withthe body starts. I have coined a phrase, “patchwork living,” to describe how onehas to keep on patching and repatching the body to keep it going. The body is atrouble most of the time: a “spark plug” is missing, or the “tires” give out;you have headaches or a cold, or the stomach goes wrong; there is difficultywith the teeth, and so on. Always trouble, trouble! That is why it is sonecessary to your happiness that you realize you are not the body, with all itsaches and pains, but an immortal soul.I don’t take life seriously at all. I say, “Lord, anytime you want to removethis body from the soul, it is all right. So long as you keep me here, allright; but if I am to be free of the body, that is all right too.” It is notnecessary to die in order to claim freedom from attachment to the body. If youcommune with God you will see that you are already free. You are not the body.You are eternal Spirit.Is there any way to find out what we were in our last incarnation? Mostcertainly we can detect basic tendencies of thought and capabilities, byanalyzing what we are now. The Hindu scriptures say that it takes a millionyears of harmonious, disease-free living for the soul to be liberated.Therefore, comparatively little change is to be expected in the ordinary manfrom life to life. But one’s spiritual evolution may definitely be hastened bydetermined effort in right living and by the help of a true guru.The sages of India have analyzed mankind as belonging to four basic types: theSudras, those capable of offering service to society through bodily labor; theVaisyas, those who serve through mentality, skill, agriculture, trade, commerce,business life in general; the Kshatriyas, those whose talents areadministrative, executive, and protective—rulers and warriors; and the Brahmins,those of contemplative nature, spiritually inspired and inspiring.Qualitatively, Sudras are those who see in life no greater purpose than thesatisfaction of wants and desires of the body; such persons eat, sleep, work,multiply, and finally die. Millions today live life in the Sudra or “laborer”state—concerned merely with the comfort and pleasure of the body.The man in the Vaisya or mentally active state is always busy getting thingsdone. Some people of this class think of nothing else but business; they liveonly to earn money, which they usually squander on sense enjoyments. But thebest Vaisya type of businessman is much more evolved and creative in nature.The third or Kshatriya class are those who, after having had the experience ofearning money and of creating something along business lines, begin tounderstand what life is all about; they strive by self-control to win the battlewith the senses. (The Vaisya man doesn’t engage himself in such effort for innerimprovement. He simply earns money and produces children and seldom thinks aboutthe meaning of life except in terms of business.) But the third or Kshatriyaclass takes life more seriously. Such a man asks himself, “Should I not strugglewith and destroy my bad habits?” He feels a desire to overcome evil tendenciesand to do what is right.The last and highest state is that of the Brahmin: knower of Brahma or God.2[part0037.html#footnote-176]Analyze Yourself to See How You Should ChangeTo recapitulate the four basic types of consciousness in man: Sudra is thesense-bound state of existence; Vaisya is the business or creative stage of man.Kshatriya is the warrior state, when man desires to do battle with his sensesand to conquer his attachment to them. Brahmin is the wisdom state, attained byman when he has overcome all attachment to the senses and remains consciouslyimmersed in Brahma, God.Every human being fits into one of these four classifications, and if youanalyze yourself you can find your class. Think over your life from childhooddays and try to reason out in which of the four classifications you belong.Reflect on whether you have been living for sense pleasures, only catering tothe senses and earning money; or perhaps just working without thinking or actingcreatively.Analyze yourself and see if you have been creative from your childhood. Somechildren, for example, think readily along mechanical lines, and want to open upand take apart things so that they can put them together again. Others show thegreatest pleasure in drawing, or in playing or listening to music. It is notnecessary to be an expert or a prima donna in order to consider that one hasshown signs of creativity in this life. Even a nonsensical song such as “Yes, WeHave No Bananas” is a product of a creative mind.Anything one creates, whether it is expertly done or not, is an expression ofcreative talent. A flair for writing novels or for acting or for woodcarving orfor painting or for music or for working with machinery, if exhibited early inlife, indicates that you were probably in the Vaisya state in your past life.Husbands and wives should not ridicule each other’s or their children’s creativetendencies. It is a sin against the evolutionary process of God to try tosuppress another’s creative spirit.Ask yourself if from childhood you have always tried to perform actions inaccordance with the guidance of your conscience. Were you constantly watchingyour actions and trying to correct yourself when you were wrong? Did you havethat struggle within from childhood? That reflects the third or Kshatriya state.But if from childhood your thoughts have always been of God, you have enteredthe fourth or spiritual state of the Brahmin.Recognition of your belonging to one of the less advanced of these four types ofmental attitude should not discourage, but encourage you. If upon self-analysisyou find that you have not yet attained to the highest state, do not thinkyourself helplessly unfortunate. The idea is that if you haven’t changed yet, itis now time that you should. Otherwise you will carry your present state intothe next life too. When death comes you want to feel that you have passed thatparticular “grade” of life, and that you are free to go on to higher grades.Therefore you should change your life now. Analyze yourself and learn what youwere before. Then you can begin to remold your life more ideally.Learn to check your moods. The violent feelings you may experience in thepresent were all created in the past. If it were not so, why is it that somechildren are jealous from the very beginning, while others in the same familyare calm and loving? There are children who would strike you if you were to tellthem not to do a thing; others are quietly obedient. Another child may steal.Why? These traits are simply outcroppings of prenatal tendencies created informer lives.I was once given a little baby to hold. I almost dropped it, for God suddenlyrevealed to me that that baby had been a cruel murderer in a previous life. Butordinarily, the past is a closely guarded secret. You may discover the truedetails only if the Lord wishes you to know them.Discern Between Inner Worth and Outer PositionOnce, in New York, a woman who was helping with Self-Realization Fellowshipoffice work confided to me that she had met a marvelous man, a “psychic,” whohad told her wonderful things about herself, including the revelation that in aformer life she had been Mary, Queen of Scots. I did not believe she had beenthat queen, and I silently uttered a little prayer that God would banish herdelusion.A few days later a student came to see me and, with great excitement, said, “Ihave just met a famous psychic (the same one the office worker had mentioned),who told me that in a past life I was Mary, Queen of Scots.” I asked the officeworker to come into the room; and, placing the two “queens” face to face, Iasked, “Which one of you is the real Mary, Queen of Scots?” The ladies, happily,realized their mistake—which was one of undiscriminating credulity and ofreadiness to confuse true inner worth with conspicuous outer position.The truth is, we love to be flattered. Unscrupulous persons thus may takeadvantage of us now and then. But who you were in a previous life and whether ornot you were important in the eyes of the world is of little consequence. It isbest to be born as a divine or Brahmin type, regardless of worldly position. Allof you have something of that divine type in you; otherwise you would not behere this morning.Exchange of Souls Between East and WestOut of millions of people, you have been drawn to this temple, because you havehad something to do with the Orient and its spiritual teachings before. Now thatyou are an Occidental, outwardly, other Occidentals may laugh at you for goingto what may seem to them a “heathen” church. Those who feel a prejudice againstthe East did not recently come from there; but those who feel a leaning towardthe East were probably born there in a recent past life. By such indications onecan distinguish Oriental and Occidental souls. Did you from early childhoodenjoy the fragrance of incense, and stories and pictures of the East? Suchinclinations would show that you had been quite recently in contact with theOrient.Many souls from the East have reincarnated now in America. Desiring materialperfection, they have been born here to enjoy the fulfillment of that desire andto help encourage American spiritual ideals. Similarly, many souls that formerlywere born in America have since reincarnated in India in order to benefit fromher spiritual riches and to help India in the development of the material sideof her civilization. I hope that many of you may go there to help India, andthat many in India will come here to serve in America. This world is God’sfamily. He is trying to improve all nations. He has no preference for one overanother.Another test of your past is your preference for certain sensations. Some peoplelike heat all the time. They have become accustomed, in other lives, to warmclimates. Others like cold better, which shows that they had been born in coldclimates before. If you have always had a special feeling for the mountains, orthe sea, you may be certain you brought that attachment from another life. Thereare people who become lonely if they are out of the city, and cannot stand quietplaces. That attitude too was cultivated in the past.Those who have a driving ambition throughout life were important men before. Tohave that tendency and not develop it is to suppress oneself. In the properenvironment such a person could become a great man. There are others who remainunsuccessful, no matter what they do to get ahead. This indicates they havecarried a failure tendency from the past. But they should not give up the battleto overcome it. Such persons must conquer wrong tendencies now or they willmanifest those faults in the next incarnation.George Eastman once told me that in the early years of his Kodak company heoffered stock for twenty-five cents a share; still it wouldn’t sell. The familyof the girl he wished to marry objected to the match. The adverse circumstanceswere such that it seemed he would never become a success; yet, after a while,everything opened up for him. Why? Because he had been creative and ambitiousbefore, and he kept on cultivating those tendencies in this life.From childhood I wished for large buildings and many people about me, and forshady trees and water wherever I might go. And these are what I attract. I alsoknew from childhood that I would have such things; that when I wished and workedfor it, these places would come easily to me. When I talked about it, peoplesometimes laughed skeptically. Nevertheless, such environments havematerialized. At our Ranchi school we have a big pond; our Dakshineswarheadquarters faces the Ganges River; our Encinitas hermitage overlooks thePacific Ocean.3 [part0037.html#footnote-175]So, through analysis of your present strong tendencies you can pretty accuratelysurmise what kind of life you led before.Past Associations Influence Present AffinitiesYou may find that you have a strong affinity to certain foreign languages andthat you are able to learn them quickly. Madame Galli-Curci, for example, amazedme by the ease with which she learned many phrases in Bengali. A love of certainlanguages is the result of past-life associations. You are attracted to Germanor French or Chinese or Bengali because you have spoken them before.Recently I met a young American girl who told me, “I have never studied anyOriental language, but lots of times I hear strange words in my mind. I can saythem, but I don’t know what they mean.” She forthwith said about nine words inBengali. She had never in this life studied the language, nor had she knownanyone who spoke Bengali. Yet she knew these words and pronounced themcorrectly.In traveling, you begin to like certain scenes more than others. If some placestands out above all the rest in its attraction for you, you have probably beenin that vicinity before.So by these various clues you may discover certain general ideas about your pastlives. From this point on, meditation can bring about a deeper knowledge of whatyou were before.Occasionally it happens that you go for the first time to a certain place whereyou seem to recognize certain scenes; but the people whom you once associatedwith those scenes are gone. And sometimes you meet people you feel you knewbefore. With me, recognition has always been instant, especially of those whohad been disciples before.4 [part0037.html#footnote-174]The following authentic case of remembrance of a past-life experience becameworld famous. A little girl, born in a small village in India, beganinexplicably to pine away for a village in another part of India. Her conditionbecame so serious that a doctor advised that she be taken to the distantvillage. This was done, and to the amazement of her companions, from the momentshe entered the outskirts of the village she began to describe in detaileverything in it. She knew people by their names (although she had never beforebeen to this village), and went directly to a certain home where she called aman by name, saying that he had been her brother in her previous life. Nor didshe stop there. She explained that in her past incarnation she had hidden somegold pieces in a brick wall of the same house, but that she had died withoutever having told anyone about it. The little girl went to the place in the wall,and lo! the gold pieces were there still. She described her clothes and how theyhad been packed away, and they were found to be exactly as she had said. In theface of such evidence, we are not justified in doubting the genuineness andsignificance of her experience.There is another case of a saint in India who went to a certain temple on ariverbank and said: “My temple was near here. It is now in the river.” Diverswent down, and found under the water a very old temple. This man had been, in aprevious life, the saint to whom the now submerged temple had been dedicated.A Pure Heart—A Clear InsightIf you keep above the consciousness of sex, and make your heart pure, so thatwhen you look at others you will not be conscious of whether they are men orwomen, you will be able always to recognize at once those souls you have knownbefore. If you have cultivated that impersonal consciousness you can instantlyrecognize people you knew before. Suppose you see a six-month-old baby, and thendo not see it again until many years have gone by and the baby has become a man.You probably do not recognize that baby in the man. Yet certain features are thesame, you would discover, if you had known that baby long enough to fix thosefeatures firmly in your mind. So, certain features of our past life remain withus. The eyes especially will be like they were before. Eyes hardly changebecause they are the windows of the soul. Those whose eyes reflect anger or fearor wickedness should try to change, to remove unlovely qualities that hide andhinder the expression of the beauty of the soul. Owing to the change ofenvironment and company, your mind and body change somewhat. But the eyes changelittle. You are reborn with the same expression in them.You can also tell by your inclinations if you were a man or a woman in your pastexistence. Many women are mannish, and many men want to be like women.Both man and woman are equal in importance. Reason and feeling are present inboth men and women. But in man reason predominates, and in woman feelingpredominates. It is easier to influence a man by appealing to his reason than tohis feeling; a woman responds more readily to an appeal to her emotions.By God-communion you bring about the harmony or balance of these two qualitieswithin yourself. I never acknowledge myself to be either man or woman. I feelfor others with the love of a mother, but no one can dissuade me by an appeal tomy emotions if my reason, or fatherly nature, does not concur. To achieve adivine balance of reason and feeling should be the purpose of both man andwoman. Man usually has to cultivate more feeling, and woman has to cultivatemore logic.We Must Perfect Love in at Least One RelationshipThere is a deep reason why God does not usually allow us to recall our previouslives. It is because we would be very clannish with those we knew before,instead of expanding our love to encompass others. God wants us to givefriendship and love to all, but we must perfect it in at least one relationship.When you meet old friends again, you can perfect your love in relationships withthem. A disciple means one in whom the guru perfects the state of divinefriendship. Those who follow the guru’s wishes are his disciples. The wishes ofa true guru are guided by divine wisdom, and if you tune in with his wishes youwill become free, as he himself is free.5 [part0037.html#footnote-173]Above all, you should learn the most you can from this life, and strive to passto the highest grade of spiritual development in the school of life. Communewith God. When you can do that, the deficiencies of all lesser grades of livingare forgiven. To free yourself from karma that binds you to the lesser duties oflife, develop wisdom and God-consciousness.[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0037.html#footnote-177-backlink] “The God-united yogi, abandoningattachment to fruits of actions, attains the peace unshakable (peace born ofself-discipline).

Others think that the realChrist has yet to come a first time. But Jesus did come on earth, and he wentaway. These are facts. Had his life been only a myth, as some say, his influencewould not have survived for so many centuries.

Such experiences are not given to those who meditatejust for a few minutes and then concentrate on something else. When you really“mean business” with God, and above all, love Him; when you willingly lose sleepin order to persist in your search for Him, then you begin to see divinevisions. They are not hallucinations. True visions are emanations of reality.Divine Justice and the Law of ReincarnationYou may or may not believe in the law of reincarnation; but if this life is thebeginning and the end of human existence, it is impossible to reconcile theinequalities of life with a divine justice. Why is one man born in a richfamily, whereas another child arrives in a poverty-stricken home, only to die ofstarvation? Why is one person healthy enough to live 100 years, and someone elsesick all the time? Why are Eskimos born in the cold north and other peoples inmoderate climates, where the struggle to survive is easier? Why are some babiesborn blind, or dead? Why? Why? Why? If you were God, would you do such unjustthings? What is the use of reading and living according to the scriptures, iflife is predestined by a whimsical God who deliberately creates beings withbodies or brains that are imperfect?According to the law of cause and effect, every action creates a commensuratereaction. Therefore whatever is happening to us now must be a result ofsomething we have done previously. If there is nothing in this life to accountfor present circumstances, the inescapable conclusion is that the cause was setin motion at some prior time; that is, in some past human existence. Yourstrongest moods and character tendencies did not begin with this birth; theywere established in your consciousness long before. Thus we may understand howsome persons show from early childhood certain definite talents, or weaknesses,and so on.We may understand, too, how the perfect life of Jesus on earth was the result ofseveral previous incarnations in which he had developed self-mastery. Hismiraculous life as Christ was the result of many past lives of spiritualschooling. He became an avatar,3 [part0038.html#footnote-189] a divineincarnation, because in previous lives as an ordinary human being he fought thetemptations of the flesh and conquered. His example gives the rest of mankinddefinite hope. Otherwise, what chance have we? If God had sent angels to teachus I would say, “Lord, why didn’t You create me as an angel? How can I emulatebeings who were created perfect and who have had no experience with the testsand temptations that You have given me?”We need for our ideal a being who is essentially like us. Jesus had temptationsto face. “Get thee behind me, Satan,” he said. And he conquered. Had he neverknown temptation, his saying, “Get thee behind me, Satan,” would have beenplayacting, and how could that inspire us? Although he had already conquered theflesh in other lives, he had to feel its weaknesses again in his incarnation asJesus, to show humanity by his mastery how high he had grown spiritually, and togive heart to all men by his example.Jesus Was Eliseus in His Former LifeJesus attained most of his perfection in his former incarnation as Eliseus(Elisha). I know for certain that he was Eliseus in a past life, and that Jesus’guru, John the Baptist, was Elijah (Elias), in his former life.4[part0038.html#footnote-188] Eliseus’ later incarnation as Jesus was foretoldseveral hundred years before the event, because he was destined to fulfill adivine plan of God's. That prophecy is told in the Book of Isaiah (7:14), eightcenturies before Christ: “Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign:Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his nameImmanuel.” St. Matthew, recording the event of Christ’s birth, stated: “Now allthis was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by theprophet, saying, Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth ason, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God withus.”5 [part0038.html#footnote-187]Jesus had learned all of life’s lessons in this school of many incarnations, andhad demonstrated his complete victory over material consciousness. That is whythe Heavenly Father said of him, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am wellpleased.”6 [part0038.html#footnote-186]Jesus was sent on earth as an example, that God’s other children might know onewho had overcome the delusions of this world. Great as he was, Jesus nonethelesssaid humbly: “I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me.”7[part0038.html#footnote-185] His entire love was for God. His wholeconsciousness was absorbed in the Father.We are all children of God. Many incarnations ago He created us as He createdJesus. In the Gospel of St. John we find Jesus himself declaring: “Is it notwritten in your law, I said, Ye are gods?”8 [part0038.html#footnote-184] Jesuswas made in the image of God, as are we; and he conquered delusion, showing ushow to do likewise. If you conquer delusion in this life you will go back to Godand reincarnate no more. “Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the templeof my God, and he shall go no more out.”9 [part0038.html#footnote-183]But will Jesus come again? Metaphysically, he is already omnipresent. He smilesat you through every flower. He feels his cosmic body in every speck of space.Every movement of the wind breathes the breath of Jesus. Through his onenesswith the divine Christ Consciousness he is incarnate in all that lives. If youhave eyes to behold, you can see him enthroned throughout creation.One who is liberated, as Jesus is, becomes one with Spirit. Yet he retains hisindividuality; for once God has created a human being, He keeps in His cosmicconsciousness a permanent record of that creation. Every thought and action ofevery creature is recorded in the consciousness of God. Jesus referred to thiswhen he said, “Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of themis forgotten before God?”10 [part0038.html#footnote-182]Christ Comes in Vision and in the Flesh to His DevoteesJesus as an individual personality can reincarnate in two ways: in vision and inthe flesh. If you have great devotion you can see him inwardly exactly as heappeared when he lived on earth. A number of saints have thus beheld him andhave relived with him various events of his life.Jesus can reincarnate again at any time, in the physical body or in the innerlight, according to your devotion and power of concentration. Reincarnation isforced upon most of humanity, but because Jesus has freed himself he can come ornot, as he wishes. He can appear to you in flesh and blood right now if you havethat complete devotion which is necessary to attract him; but he will not comeso long as your devotion is even one percent less than that.Years ago, when I was living and teaching in Boston, I once became so busy thatI forgot God for three days. The thought of continuing like that wasintolerable; I was preparing to pack up everything and leave America. But justthen a student of this path came by and asked to meditate with me. As we satthere in meditation I began to pray: “Lord, I love Your work here in America,but I love You more than the work, and if I am going to forget You in thiscountry I will leave.” Inwardly I heard the voice of God: “What do you want?”Impulsively I said, “I would like to see Krishna and Christ with all theirdisciples.” Instantly I beheld them, on a sea of gold, just as clearly as I amseeing you; and I worshiped them.But in a little while my mind began to doubt. “This is not real,” I thought. SoI prayed again: “Lord, if the vision is true, let the other devotee in this roomalso see it.” My friend suddenly cried out, “Oh! Krishna and Christ, on a sea ofgold!”Then a new doubt arose: was it only thought transference? But even as this ideacrossed my mind, the voice of God said: “When I leave, the room will becomefilled with the fragrance of the lotus, and whoever comes shall notice it.” Eachperson who later visited me in that room unfailingly asked, “What is thisstrange fragrance of flowers that I smell?”For most of his followers Christ exists as an ideal personage they have readabout in the Bible. But to me he is much more than that. He is real. Once, eightyears ago, he came alone and meditated with me all night long. During that timeI saw a vision of the Hermitage.11 [part0038.html#footnote-181] Many other timesI have seen him in visions, and talked with him. And that same Christ you toocan see.You must be prepared to give up everything for communion with God. He will testyou. When you pray and pray and meditate and still you don’t see Him, but say,“Lord, it doesn’t matter, You know that I am praying and I am not going to stopuntil You come”—then He will respond. One saint said, “I don’t care when Hecomes—I know He will come.” That is the attitude one must have.When you make up your mind to work to attain the Christ consciousness that Jesushad, God will help you to fulfill that desire. But first you must attainself-mastery, even as Jesus did. God does not bestow great spiritual powers ondevotees until they show Him they have conquered their human weaknesses.Otherwise they might hurt other persons, even destroy whole nations, by misuseof the divine might.Jesus had sovereign power; he could easily have saved himself from crucifixion,but during the agony in the Garden he only said, “Father, not my will, butthine, be done,”12 [part0038.html#footnote-180] and on the Cross, “Father,forgive them; for they know not what they do.”13 [part0038.html#footnote-179] Inthose final tests he showed he had wholly conquered all ego-impulses. When youhave unlimited power, as Jesus did, and when everyone spurns you and still youdo not retaliate, you are a conqueror indeed.All Great Avatars Will Come AgainEvery saint who has come on earth has contributed toward the fulfillment ofGod’s desire for the spiritual upliftment of all His human children. The greatones come with two purposes: to inspire and enlighten a certain number or alarge mass of people; and to train real disciples, those who pattern their livesafter the master’s. The latter are the members of the saint’s true “family,”constituting an inner group in whom he plants his spiritual life. Jesus hadtwelve such disciples—and others too—but one of the twelve betrayed his love andtrust. The most difficult task for every God-ordained spiritual teacher is toproduce others like himself, but Jesus made genuinely Christlike disciples.Every spiritually enlightened teacher tries to enable many devotees to communewith God. Yet each great master nevertheless leaves some “unfinished symphony.”Because it remains unfinished, that teacher has to come back again; but the timedepends on God’s will. What I am telling you is not in any book, nor is itanyone else’s idea; but it is true.Jesus often healed others, but they didn’t always appreciate it. And he tired ofhealing their physical ills; he wanted men to know God. He sought only theirhighest good, but they crucified him; and so not all of his desire for theirspiritual development was fulfilled. That is why he has to come back again.Great ones such as he return to earth to take more souls to God. Even thoughthey have attained their own perfection, their desire for others’ happiness andperfection has not been fulfilled. They want to bring their lost brothers backto God.When you pray to Jesus he feels your prayer. Free souls such as Jesus are awareof the calls of their devotees. You may not know they are receiving thevibrations of your feelings, but they are. And when your demand is very strong,the great ones come to you.Their desire is to redeem the whole earth, because every saint ofGod-realization knows there is no death for him. He is living in that EternalJoy. Yet such saints are aware of the world’s grief. They say to the HeavenlyFather, “People are killing one another and suffering in many other ways. Whymust this be?” And God says: “I will send you back sometime to help them.”The God-ordained saviors of mankind have to return to earth again, but when theywill come, no one can say. Thus many people believe in Christ’s second coming;but when it may happen depends on the will of God. The great ones come only withthe permission of the Heavenly Father. In some cases, when the time is set, theprophets speak of it; but other avatars come unannounced. Just the same, theycome. I too wish to come, again and again.I want to ply my boat, many times,Across the gulf-after-death,And return to earth’s shores from my home in Heaven.I want to load my boatWith those waiting, thirsty ones who are left behind,And carry them by the opal pool of iridescent joyWhere my Father distributesHis all-desire-quenching liquid peace.14 [part0038.html#footnote-178]It will be a wonderful thing to come to help all, and that is the way everyoneshould want to live on this earth. Why seek selfish gain? If we are known toGod, we become known to His children, for in God we are all one. It is soimportant that we find Him! For our own sake we must know His love and beimmersed in Him—night and day one continuous joy, unending happiness.Great souls will reincarnate again. God gave them individuality and a divinerole to play for Him. They have to do their work because they love God. Theywill come, because there are hosts of brothers in this world who are stumblingin the mud of delusion and suffering. The great ones have to come again, asJesus too will come again, to take more souls to the kingdom of Heaven.[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0038.html#footnote-191-backlink] Revelation 1:7.2 [part0038.html#footnote-190-backlink] The light of the spiritual eye betweenthe eyebrows. “The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye besingle, thy whole body shall be full of light” (Matthew 6:22).3 [part0038.html#footnote-189-backlink] See avatar[part0074.html#_idTextAnchor088] in glossary.4 [part0038.html#footnote-188-backlink] Referring to John the Baptist, Jesussaid, “And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come” (Matthew11:14).5 [part0038.html#footnote-187-backlink] Matt. 1:22–23.6 [part0038.html#footnote-186-backlink] Matt. 3:17.7 [part0038.html#footnote-185-backlink] John 8:28.8 [part0038.html#footnote-184-backlink] John 10:34.9 [part0038.html#footnote-183-backlink] Rev. 3:12.10 [part0038.html#footnote-182-backlink] Luke 12:6.11 [part0038.html#footnote-181-backlink] This talk was given in 1939; theHermitage in Encinitas was built in 1936.

But in sleep we have a heightenedcreative power of visualization and manifestation; our thoughts swiftly erectthe various structures of a dream. The projection of dream images requires boththought and energy, just as the projection of moving pictures requires both filmand the electrical energy of light.In sleep, life energy is released from various bodily demands and retires to thebrain cells, in which are stored the thought films of all past experiences. Theenlivening action of the energy on the stored-up thought films in thesubconscious mind results in the projection of the mental motion pictures wecall dreams. Dreams are actually lessons in the working of Cosmic Consciousness.They come to man for a reason; their purpose is to awaken in him a realizationof the dream nature of the universe and of the method of its operation.The sages of India since ancient times have spoken of the universe as amaterialization of the thought of God. It is easy to say, of course, that thisuniverse is a dream. But the verisimilitude of “life” in our everydayexperiences makes it nearly impossible for us to believe that the world isnothing more than a cosmic dream. It is necessary that we first develop mindpower in order to be able to realize that the universe is actually made out ofthe thought of God and that, like a dream, it is structurally evanescent.We know that thoughts are invisible. But in dreamland they may be made visibleby the force of energy. So originally this whole universe—in the form of God’sthoughts—was invisible, hidden within the cosmic stream of consciousness. Onlywhen those thoughts were crystallized by God’s cosmic intelligent vibration, orenergy, did they become visible to us as the material universe.So, although it is difficult to realize that this cosmic dream universe ismerely a dream, we should endeavor to think along this line. Many practicalbenefits will come to us from such a true understanding of the physical world.To illustrate, let us say that a sleeping man dreams he is a great and powerfulwarrior; that he goes to war, is shot, and lies dying. Just as he is feelingvery sad, he suddenly wakes up. He laughs at his dream fears as he realizes heis not really a warrior, nor is he dying.In “real” life one may have the same kind of experience. A soldier who goes towar and is mortally wounded suddenly wakes up in the astral world and realizesthat the war experience was all a bad dream—that he has neither broken bones nora physical body. Nevertheless, he is still conscious of life and of hisindividuality.In order to realize that all the happenings of this world are dream experiences,we should learn how to visualize our thoughts—how to recharge them with theenergy of concentration until they become visible manifestations. Propervisualization by the exercise of concentration and will power enables us tomaterialize thoughts, not only as dreams or visions in the mental realm, butalso as experiences in the material realm.Matter Originates in ThoughtStarting with the power of his creative imagination, man has built wonderfulscientific devices and a marvelous material civilization. Inventions are theresult of the materialization of human thought. Many people try to achievesomething in the realm of thought, but they give up when difficulties arise.Only those persons who have visualized their thoughts very strongly have beenable to manifest them in outward form. Everything on earth had its birth in thefactory of the mind—either in God’s mind or in man’s mind. Actually, man cannotthink an “original” thought. He can only borrow God’s thoughts and become aninstrument to materialize them.Experiment with your thoughts. Try out your strongest thoughts on your body. Seeif you cannot overcome undesirable habits and persistent ailments. When you aresuccessful you may apply your thought to make changes in the world around you.The relationship between thought and matter is very subtle. Suppose you see awooden pillar, and try, by the power of thought, to remove the pillar. Youcannot do that. In spite of what you think, the pillar is still there. It is amaterialization of someone’s previous thought. It will not go away merely byyour thinking it is not there. Only when you realize it as a materialization ofthought may you dematerialize it to your consciousness. As you learn byexperimenting with overcoming habits, pain, and so on, you will begin tounderstand that the entire design of the body and all its processes arecontrolled by thought.One may gather great wisdom by cultivating the consciousness that this world andeverything in it is only a dream. First of all, do not take your earthexperiences too seriously. The root cause of sorrow is in viewing the passingshow with emotional involvement. If you continually think to yourself, “Ihaven’t lived as I ought to have lived,” you only make yourself miserable.Rather, do your best to be better; and no matter what difficulties come, everaffirm, “It is all a dream. It will soon pass.” Then no trouble can be a greattrial to you. No happenings of this earth can in any way torture you.The consciousness of pain also has to be overcome if you are to know that theworld is only a dream. When I was a child I was hurt frequently when playingfootball, and whenever I dreamed of playing football I always dreamed that I washurt. That fear-thought of being hurt had become rooted in my subconscious mind,so that I suffered dream injuries even in sleep!So one should not take his troubles too seriously, lest they darken thesubconscious mind. Difficulties come to us in order to awaken us to therealization that this life is a dream. This lesson we all have to learn. Then wecan understand why there is so much difference in everything in the world: somepeople are poor, some are rich; some are healthy and some are sick. Although itmay seem to be a terrible and cruel game, the justification of the complicationsof life is that all of it is only a dream. Take it as such.Think of the many aspirations and hopes you entertained as a child and as ayouth. They have gradually left you, but do not be discouraged; always believethat, whatever is coming, it will simply be another scene in the dream movie ofGod that is being shown in the playhouse of our minds. We have to behold dreamtragedies and dream comedies that we may be variously entertained. If you can goto a movie and see a picture of war and suffering, and afterward say, “What awonderful picture!” so may you take this life as a cosmic picture-show. Beprepared for every kind of experience that may come to you, realizing that allare but dreams.Each human life constitutes a drama; and the events of each day represent adrama. You are living a fresh one each of the year’s 365 days. The thought thatyou are merely a player in these dramas is very comforting. Realize that theacting out of whatever part you are called upon to play does not affect yourreal being. At the end of every earthly incarnation you are the same—theimmortal soul—untouched by sickness, sorrow, or death. “He who cannot be ruffledby these (contacts of the senses with their objects), who is calm and evenmindedduring pain and pleasure, he alone is fit to attain everlastingness!”1[part0039_split_000.html#footnote-195]Pride Is the Greatest Barrier to WisdomThe experiences of my life have intensified my conviction that human pride isthe greatest barrier to wisdom. Egotistical pride must go. It is a blind thatprevents our seeing God as the sole Doer, the Director of the Cosmic Drama. Youare playing different parts in this cosmic movie-house, and you may not foreseewhat part will be assigned to you tomorrow. You should be prepared for anything.Such is the law of life. Why sorrow, then, over life’s experiences? If you takeevery happening as you would if you were seeing someone else playing it in amotion picture, you will not grieve. Play your 365 roles each year with aninward smile and with the remembrance that you are only dreaming. Then you willnever again be hurt by life.You have played many roles through many incarnations. But they were all given toentertain you—not to frighten you. Your immortal soul cannot be touched. In themotion picture of life you may cry, you may laugh, you may play many parts; butinwardly you should ever say, “I am Spirit.” Great consolation comes fromrealization of that wisdom.You cannot expect to wake up from the delusion that earth life is real merely byrunning away into the forest. You have to play out to the end the part that isgiven you. Each human being is contributing to the enactment of the motionpicture of the cosmos. If you want to be happy you should play out your partwith dignity, assurance, and happiness. When you are awake in God He will showyou that you are unchanged, even though you have played countless parts in Hisearth drama.Dissociate Yourself From Your ExperiencesThink of it! Of the fifteen hundred million people who have died every hundredyears, each one has played a definite part in this cosmic motion picture. Infact, each human being has played in addition a separate “home movie,” his ownprivate motion picture. If you were to multiply all the motion-picture livesportrayed by those millions of beings, you wouldn’t be able to count them. Butthis show has a purpose: that you learn how to play the various parts of thelife movie without identifying your Self with your role. It is important toavoid identification with pain or anger or any kind of mental or physicalsuffering that comes. The best way to dissociate yourself from your difficultyis to be mentally detached, as if you were merely a spectator, while at the sametime seeking a remedy.Don’t expect to attain unalloyed peace and happiness from earthly life. Thisshould be your new attitude: no matter what your experiences are, enjoy them inan objective way, as you would a movie. You have to find true peace andhappiness within yourself. Your outer experiences should be only fun. You canconvert all of them into miserable ones if you allow your mind to do so. You mayhave good health and not appreciate it at all. But if you become unwell, thenyou will appreciate what it is to have health. Show gratitude to God for what Hebestows on you, without waiting for reverses to make you grateful.You are a child immortal. You have come on earth to entertain and to beentertained. This is why life should be a combination of both meditation andactivity. If you lose your inner balance, that is just the time when you arevulnerable to worldly suffering. Don’t disgrace the name of God, the One inwhose image you are made. Awaken the innate fortitude of the mind by affirming,“No matter what experiences come, they cannot touch me. I am always happy.”When I look back and compare, I find that life was much simpler at the time westarted our first hermitage (in a little mud hut in India that we had rented forone rupee) than it is now, when we have the responsibility of maintaining thislarge institution. Yet I preserve my mental balance no matter what trials come.Learn to laugh at difficulties by remembering that you are immortal: “Killedmany times, I yet live; born many times, I am yet changeless.” Whether you aresuffering in this life, or smiling with opulence and power, your consciousnessshould remain unchanged. If you can accomplish evenmindedness, nothing can everhurt you. The lives of all great masters show that they have achieved thisblessed state.In order to be able to say with realization that all things are in the mind, youmust first develop an inner consciousness of divine peace that remains unruffledby the experiences of this earth. Accept them as you would dreams; and the timewill come when you will find that, just by the power of your strong thought,whatever you think will materialize. This is very difficult to do, but it can bedone.A scientist must busy himself with going through several experiments in order toarrive at one fact. But the spiritually developed man is able to perceive thefact without going through a physical process. If you first become one with God,then whatever you think can be materialized. This truth was demonstrated manytimes by Jesus. He had realized his unity with God.Concentrate First on GodOne’s first concentration should be on union with God. Every day as you gothrough various earthly situations, mentally practice your oneness with God. Ifa pain comes along to disturb that consciousness you should reason, “Well, if Iwere asleep I wouldn’t feel this pain; why should I be aware of it now? Allexperiences are fleeting dreams.” Practice overcoming all trials in this manner.The first state of concentration is to be able to see in your mind’s eyeanything that you wish. For example, I can keep looking at this room andconcentrating upon it until, when I close my eyes, I can still see the roomexactly as it is. This is the first step in deep concentration, but most peoplehaven’t the patience to practice it. I had the patience.As you continue to practice visualization you will find that your thoughtsbecome materialized. The cosmic law will so arrange it that whatsoever you arethinking of will be produced in actuality, if you command it to be so.Suppose I am thinking of an apple, and the apple appears in my hand. That wouldbe a demonstration of the highest power of concentration. The great ones canmaterialize anything right before your eyes, as did Babaji when he materializeda palace at the time of Lahiri Mahasaya’s initiation in the Himalayas.2[part0039_split_000.html#footnote-194] That was an expression of the power ofconcentration in its highest form. Nothing worthwhile may be gained withouteffort and without concentration.Don’t be sensitive about the body and material concerns, nor let anyone hurtyou. Keep your consciousness aloof. Give good-will to all, but develop a stateof consciousness wherein nobody can ruffle you. Try to make others happy everyday. Share your wisdom with others. Do not permit yourself to lose interest inlife. Learn everything about one thing, and something about everything. Realizethat the more you seek, the more you will find; the realms of thought areinfinite. The moment you think you have attained everything, you havecircumscribed yourself. Search on and on, continuously, and in the valley ofyour humbleness will gather the ocean of God’s wisdom.The greatest thing you can do to cultivate true wisdom is to practice theconsciousness of the world as a dream. If failure comes, say, “It is a dream.”Then shut off the thought of failure from your mind. In the midst of negativeconditions, practice “opposition” by thinking and acting in a positive,constructive way. Practice titiksha, which means not to give in to unpleasantexperiences, but to resist them without becoming upset mentally. When sicknesscomes, follow hygienic laws of living, without permitting your mind to bedisturbed. Be unruffled in everything you do. If you try hard to cultivate thedream-opposite of whatever trials you may be going through, you will be able tochange a nightmarish situation into a beautiful experience. That freedom of mindwill come when you realize that solids, liquids, and all other forms of matterare expressions of God’s thought.The best way to find true freedom is to meditate deeply. You can learn how tomeditate by studying the truths in the Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons. Noone else can convey to you the taste of sugar; you have to taste it yourself.Yesterday I was sitting in my room, looking back over my life, and I realizedthat everything in the outer world that had promised great happiness haddeceived me; but one thing has never deceived me—my inner peace. Indescribablebillows of happiness surge over my soul. As I passed through various experiencesover the years, that unchanging inner peace has been proof to me of theexistence of God.I was just thinking this when suddenly I saw a great Light. Everything elsevanished. There was feeling—that was all. My hand was not a hand, but a feeling.When I touched my hands together there was no flesh there, only feeling. Then Iunderstood that I had become thoughts; everything around me, the light and theroom and the weight of the body—all were nothing but thoughts.It was a delightful experience. Gone were the sorrow and sadness I had felt forthings past, and in their place a great sense of freedom.That consciousness of God-peace is never-ending. It is the only real state ofhappiness. Everything else will fail you. Nothing else can make you happybecause only the joy of His presence is real.It is not necessary to go through every kind of human experience in order toattain this ultimate wisdom. You should be able to learn by studying the livesof others. Why become helplessly involved in an endless panorama of events inorder to discover that nothing in this world can ever make you happy?One may learn the truth in two ways: by undergoing many good and badexperiences, or by cultivating wisdom. Choose which you prefer. Krishna said:“The attainment of wisdom immediately bestows supreme peace.”3[part0039_split_000.html#footnote-193] Jesus said: “Seek ye first the kingdom ofGod.”4 [part0039_split_000.html#footnote-192] If you are seeking something elsefirst, you will surely be disillusioned. Each man rationalizes, “Well, othershave been deceived, but I won’t be.” Nevertheless, he will be deceived. The onlyexperience that is real, the only experience that brings happiness, is awarenessof the presence of God.[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0039_split_000.html#footnote-195-backlink] Bhagavad Gita II:15.2 [part0039_split_000.html#footnote-194-backlink] See Autobiography of a Yogi,chapter 34. Nikola Tesla, renowned electrical scientist and inventor, understoodthe possibility of direct materialization. He wrote:“Long ago he (man) recognized that all perceptible matter comes from a primarysubstance, or a tenuity beyond conception, filling all space, the Akasa orluminiferous ether, which is acted upon by the life-giving Prana, or creativeforce, calling into existence, in never-ending cycles, all things and phenomena.“Can man control this grandest, most awe-inspiring of all processes in nature?Can he harness her inexhaustible energies to perform all their functions at hisbidding, more still cause them to operate simply by the force of his will?“If he could do this, he would have powers almost unlimited and supernatural. Athis command, with but a slight effort on his part, old worlds would disappearand new ones of his planning would spring into being. He could fix, solidify,and preserve the ethereal shapes of his imagining, the fleeting visions of hisdreams. He could express all the creations of his mind on any scale, in formsconcrete and imperishable.“To create and to annihilate material substance, cause it to aggregate in formsaccording to his desire, would be the supreme manifestation of the power ofMan’s mind, his most complete triumph over the physical world, his crowningachievement, which would place him beside his Creator, make him fulfill hisultimate destiny.”—Copyright 1944 by J.

If children would reflect on the love shown themby the mother, they would feel a desire to give similar affection to all thechildren of the world. May all sons and daughters who have been nurtured by amother’s love be themselves filled with a mother’s affection, which isunconditional love, and express it toward others. Thus shall they solace theworld with peace and bring heaven on earth.The mother’s love is not given to us to spoil us with indulgence, but to softenour hearts, that we may in turn soften others with kindness, and free strugglingsouls from the hard knots of bondage to the world. Those who are helplesslyshackled by sin and dire difficulties need our tenderness and love.My sincere and complete devotion to my earthly mother was the first cause of mylove for the Divine Mother. Thus it was my great love for my mother that led tomy illumination.In India we like to speak of God as Mother Divine, because a true mother is moretender and forgiving than a father. The mother is an expression of theunconditional love of God. Mothers were created by God to show us that He lovesus with or without cause. Every woman is to me a representative of the Mother. Isee the Cosmic Mother in all. That which I find most admirable in woman is hermother love. Those who think of woman as an object of lust perish in that fire;but those who look upon all women as incarnations of the Mother Divine find inthem a sacredness that is inviolable. When you can see every woman as yourmother, as some of our God-realized masters in India did, universal love comesinto your heart.Certain skeptical followers of a great saint wanted to test him, and sent to himsome beautiful prostitutes. He quickly jumped up and cried: “Mother Divine, inthese forms You have come to me. I bow to you all.” The women knelt before himand were ashamed. From that moment they were spiritually changed.Every man who looks upon woman as an incarnation of the Immortal Mother willfind salvation. A husband should see in his wife the pure beauty of the MotherDivine. Looking upon the wife as the Mother, he will find in her a holy essencenot discerned before.Mothers would not be able to love their children if God hadn’t implanted thatlove in them. Yet credit belongs to the instrument also, because the flood ofdivine love passes through the human mother. All the great masters have shownhonor to their mothers. Swami Shankara,1 [part0040.html#footnote-196] after thedeath of his mother, disregarded the monastic injunctions against performingceremonial family rites and cremated her body in a divine flame that he causedto emanate from his hand.A home is made gracious by the presence of the Divine Mother in the form of thehuman mother. Isn’t that a thought to remember? Do not forget it. Love for theMother must be constantly cultivated in your heart, so that whenever you see awoman, you behold her as your mother. If you look upon woman without lust of theeyes, you will be able to draw from her store of spiritual treasures.Why was the mother given such love? That she might love her childunconditionally. Loving one’s own child is only a practice of the love divine.The mother thinks it is her own child, but it is the child of God. The childwill be taken away as soon as the Divine Spirit calls. So every mother shouldextend that love she feels for her child unto all the children of the earth.A mother is expected to look after her son, and a son is told to honor hismother; but I say that a son should not only love his mother but should look onall women as expressions of the Divine Mother.Each mother should remember that the divine unconditional love is passingthrough her and she is blessed. She should realize that it is not her own loveshe gives, but the love of the Mother Divine in her. She should be proud of herchildren, but should not limit herself by bestowing love only on her own sonsand daughters. A mother should give divine unconditional love to all. This is mymessage for you today.Mothers, be proud that the Divine Mother took your form to give love tangibly tothe world, not only to your children but unto all children of the earth. Thenyou will be really blessed; and instead of thinking that you have one child, orfive children, you will realize, “I have many children all over the earth.” Inthat awareness you are one with the Divine Mother.The mother who looks upon all God’s children as her own is no longer a mortalmother. She becomes the Mother Immortal. This is what all women saints are. Oneday they realize: “The great love that I feel for my child I now feel for all.Now I know that I am not this body, but an expression of the Cosmic Mother.”Think what you can do! From an ordinary woman to Divine Mother! And why not? TheUniversal Mother made you in Her image and you should manifest that image bybestowing on all beings Her illimitable love.PART TWO: THE FATHERSelf-Realization Fellowship Temple, Hollywood, California, Father’s Day, June18, 1944On this Father’s Day we affirm our fealty to the Heavenly Father. While thehuman father’s love is not always unconditional, still his love is guided bywisdom, regard for law, and the will to protect others. The Divine Father ofwisdom, law, and protection, who is represented in all good human fathers, wehonor today.A father should remember he is not just a human parent; he is a representativeof the Heavenly Father. To that Cosmic Father I pay tribute. It is He who isbehind all fathers. Each father should therefore realize that he has aresponsibility to behave properly, for the transparent light of Spirit cannotflow through him if his mind is darkened with delusion and erroneous thoughts.He must keep himself pure, for it is through him and through all other fathersthat the Heavenly Father looks after the children of earth.A human father’s body and mind ought to be a temple of the Divine Father. As aninstrument of the Divine Being, the father plays his greatest creative role whenhe implants in his children thoughts that will lead to God-realization.To produce offspring is not a unique accomplishment; the animals do that. But toproduce children on the plane of divine love and in a spiritual consciousness isan important achievement. Even animals may be bred to order; yet many humanchildren are born out of passion and accident, emotion and evil. How can they bepure and perfect? The perpetrators of thefts and other crimes are usuallychildren who were born out of passion, although sometimes there is a good soulhere and there.Example Is the Best TeacherCharacter building should be taught in schools and colleges, but fathers shouldrealize that example is more important than schooling. One should not tell hischildren, “Do not do as I do, but do as I say.” If you do not want a child tosmoke, you yourself should not smoke. If you want a child to be mild and nobleof speech, you should not talk to your wife impatiently, because the childnotices your example. Be kind in word and thought because it is the HeavenlyFather who has taken your form to look after the child.Let every father remember, when tempted to speak to a child with dictatorialharshness, “Because my voice is meant to be used by the Cosmic Father, I shouldnever allow Satan, the father of ignorance, to speak through me with mean,unreasoning sternness. I should always guide my children with the lovingpersuasiveness of truth. My mind should be a transparent glass through whichshines the Heavenly Father’s light of wisdom.”We should use the wisdom of the Father-God and the love of the Mother-God tobring peace on earth. A good father could never bring himself to kill hischildren; and if all fathers filled their hearts with the love of the DivineFather, who cares for His children of all nations, how could there be any war?Love is the spiritual weapon with which to end all war.To the Lord I have dedicated my voice, my eyes, my hands, my feet, my heart, mybody, my feelings, my will—my being. I say to all fathers: “When you destroy theego, you will realize the protecting nature and wisdom of the Heavenly Fatherworking through you.”[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0040.html#footnote-196-backlink] Lord Shankara’s Prayer to the DivineMother for Forgiveness of Sins bears the refrain: “Though bad sons are many,never has there been a bad mother.”"},{"pageContent":"Looking at Creation With Seeing EyesSelf-Realization Fellowship International Headquarters, Los Angeles, California,August 17, 1939Marvelous indeed is the Lord’s universe. Within it He is working all His wondersof creation. Do not be a walking “dead man” in this world; observe, analyze, andappreciate what God and His agent, man, have wrought here. How intricate is theuniversal mechanism! Reflect on the way we are made, and in what orderly fashionthe whole machinery of creation runs according to cosmic law.We all see the flowers and enjoy their beauty, but who knows what is causing theflowers? Anything one uses or sees every day—be it a handkerchief, a musicalinstrument, a house, or a tree—he should question and ponder by what means, ofwhat substance, it is made. Cars are taken for granted; but if you were to visitthe factories in which they are produced, you would realize how complicatedautomobiles are. Consider too what went into making the paper for the dailynews, and the intricate machinery that imprints it—no human hand could operateso fast.And if the creation of everyday man-made objects can be so complex, how vastlymore complicated the creation of plants, animals, and human beings! It takes tenyears’ study of medical science to understand the composition, functions, andrequirements of the seemingly simple human body. Even a casual analysis revealsmuch to wonder at—though I sometimes think God could have made a fewimprovements!When a plant is growing in water in a glass jar, one can see that its roots arelike hairs. Through the God-given intelligent energy in the roots the plantdraws from soil and water the food it requires for growth. Like an upturnedplant, man similarly absorbs through his hair electric currents helpful to thebody.1 [part0041.html#footnote-205]Is it not amazing that the sap which feeds the leaves of the plant flows upwardagainst the pull of gravity? When the skin of the plant is removed, one can seethe intricate network of tubes that channel this sap. That which carries on thisprocess of sustenance and growth is the mystery called life. When I am in theecstasy of God-consciousness, I behold this life in even a blade of grass.Little did I dream that I would be able to see such hidden marvels of creation!To concentrate on these marvels is to stand in awe of what the Lord has done.With calculated precision God has ordained the structural form of each livingthing, and the requirements for maintaining that form in good working order. Ifthere is any deficiency in those requirements—food, for example—plants, animals,and human beings suffer. The average person draws from his food all the variouschemical elements his body needs; but there are many dietary transgressors whosemeals do not contain all the required elements, or the correct balance of them.Improper nourishment is one of the main causes of all sickness in man. Theeffects of dietary deficiency can be seen almost immediately in a plant whensome necessary chemical is omitted from its food.There are vital exchanges between man and all other living things. For eonsIndia has had the custom of cremation and scattering the ashes of the dead. Inthis and other ways man feeds Mother Earth, and her plants in turn feed man.The reciprocity between man and trees is well known. Man inhales oxygen andexhales carbon dioxide.2 [part0041.html#footnote-204] Trees absorb and storecarbon dioxide and water, which they break down by photosynthesis to createcarbohydrates (food). In the process they give off oxygen, essential to man.3[part0041.html#footnote-203] Photosynthesis, being dependent on sunlight, stopsat night. However, through another process called respiration, treescontinuously release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, particularly at nightwhen the counteracting influence of carbon-absorbing, oxygen-producingphotosynthesis is not present. As night air is usually still, the heavy carbondioxide gas settles near the ground. In part for this reason, the custom ofsleeping on beds—that is, above ground level—came about.The Limitations of the Physical SensesScience has taught us a great deal about the intricate mechanisms of ouruniverse and about the substances of which we are all made, but there is stillvast knowledge to be uncovered. We could perceive more and appreciate more if wedeveloped the underlying powers of our sensory organs. Things we should see withour eyes we do not see, things we should hear with our ears we do not hear,because our senses are too habituated, too attached, to experiences of thelimited gross physical world. Freedom from that attachment is not negation ofsensory enjoyment; it permits a broadening of the God-given sensory powers totheir fullest spiritual potential.On the material plane man has discovered various ways to increase his seeingpower. The unaided physical eye receives only limited impressions of color.However, under ultraviolet light, drab-looking pieces of rock in which certainminerals are present will show forth luminescent colors. Remove the ultravioletlight and the rocks assume their original dull hue. Many colors in the physicalworld, such as the blue of the sky, are really optical illusions caused by thereflection of light on various kinds of particles. Because your eyes registeronly a limited degree of the creative vibration that makes up everything increation, you do not see the subtle astral4 [part0041.html#footnote-202] colors,which are hidden in everything around you. Could you but see, you would beamazed at their beauty. Even the most gorgeous shades on earth appear ugly,gross, and wild in comparison to the magnificent hues of the astral world.So neither your eyes nor your ears register everything possible. You cannotsmell astral fragrances, nor perceive with your other physical sense organs themyriad finer forms and impressions passing through the ether. Even if St.Francis were here at this moment in his astral form, you would not be able tosee and hear and touch him. Yet it is possible to advance beyond ordinarysensory limitations, for I have seen him.Often man does not cognize even things that his senses are able to perceive.Those persons who have perceptive eyes enjoy beauty everywhere. Others act as ifthey had no eyes; even in a beautiful place they fail to “see” anything. When Ivisited Mexico and saw the “Floating Gardens” of Lake Xochimilco,5[part0041.html#footnote-201] their loveliness filled my heart with awareness ofthe Divine Artist. Another man, standing nearby, seemed equally engrossed.However, something told me he was not seeing what I was seeing, so I asked hisreaction to the picturesque scene. “I was thinking of how to drain off the waterand make more land,” he replied. An engineer, he was seeing the lake in his ownway. So we view things according to our different mentalities and moods.Every soul is encased in a composite vibration of sensations, thoughts,feelings—all the factors that make up a person’s being, or consciousness. Eachone has a different composition, a different vibration. All the things you havedone since childhood are stored in tabloid form as tendencies in your brain.They make you what you are. Because we do not see this tabloid pattern, wewonder why people behave as they do. Some become suddenly elated, orinexplicably angry or moody; even they don’t know why. Some are always busycriticizing or gossiping about others, when there is plenty of “house-cleaning”to do in their own “home”! The invisible tabloid tendencies in the brain compeleach one to behave in certain ways. They bury the soul, preventing theexpression of one’s true Self. How complex is man! each one in himself afull-length novel.The Infinite Potential of ThoughtMan is supposed to get something out of this life besides eating, sleeping, andworking. The thinkers begin to wonder about life. They observe and question whythings happen, or do not happen, in a certain way. We have a first and then asecond set of teeth; why not a third? What causes this regulation? Because ofman’s unquestioning acceptance of many delusive thoughts of physical limitation,he allows them to control his present sphere of existence. Thinkers do notaccept the inevitable; they turn their efforts toward changing it. This is theingredient that makes progress possible.I am thrilled when I see the great manufacturing centers, the remarkableinventions, and other exceptional human accomplishments. How much has come fromthe brain of man! And the brain itself is infinitely more intricate thananything it has produced.There is a story about a certain king who showed such affectionate regard forhis prime minister that others in the court, noticing the monarch’s obviouspreference, were jealous. Realizing this, the king wanted to show them why theminister was his favorite. Some music sounded in the distance, and the kingturned to one of his courtiers, saying, “Please find out what is going on.”After some time the man returned with the information that it was a marriageprocession. “Who is going to be married?” inquired the king. The courtier didn’tknow, so another courtier was sent out. The man returned with a reply to theking’s latest query, but when the sovereign asked another question he could notanswer. The result was the same with courtier after courtier. Finally the kingcalled for the prime minister and asked him to go and find out what was takingplace. When the minister returned, the king plied him with questions, every oneof which the alert and thorough prime minister was able to answersatisfactorily.A great many persons are dull-minded like the uninformed courtiers. They are notnecessarily stupid; just too mentally lazy to make any effort beyond obviousnecessity. I can condone physical laziness (there might be a justifiablephysiological cause); but there is no excuse for mental laziness! The mentallyidle do not like to think, because even that seems too much work for them.Thought is fascinating. No one will ever be able to tabulate all the tendenciesand perceptions of the mind; its capacity is infinite. Yet the mind cannot thinkan original thought: there is not a single idea that God has not originatedalready in conceiving His past, present, and future creations. Therefore if youthink deeply enough about a subject, the answer to any question about it willcome.You must feel as well as think; if you do not have feeling along with yourthoughts, you will not always be successful in reaching the right conclusion.Feeling is an expression of intuition, the repository of all knowledge. Feelingand thought, or reason, must be balanced; only then does the divine image of Godwithin you, the soul, manifest its full nature. Hence Yoga teaches one how tobalance his powers of reason and feeling. One who does not have both equally isnot a fully developed person.In God-Consciousness Everything Becomes BeautifulIn my younger days I used to go sight-seeing, but my interest was only intemples. As my consciousness changed with the practice of meditation, I began tolook at the world differently; everything seemed transformed and interesting tome. Now I see behind all creation the kingdom of my Father. It is enchantingbeyond any dreams of this world! And sometimes I see the beauties of His kingdomshowing through the gross physical creation.As you progress spiritually and draw closer to God, He reveals to you more andmore wonders of creation. Even in the dead and ugly-looking stalks of a wheatfield after the harvest you will see life. It played its part there, and to theordinary eye it is gone; but with the divine eye6 [part0041.html#footnote-200]you will see, even in the outer desolation, the beautiful colors of dancingelectrons and protons.Behind every material object is an astral blueprint of colored light. In theastral world everything is motion, everything is living; there is nothing called“dead.” Even in the physical world death is not cessation of life, only a changeinto a different form. Life is still throbbing in the “lifeless” object. In thebones of dead animals I have beheld rich colors and vibrating light.You see only the gross material products coming from God’s hidden factory behindcreation; but if you went into the factory itself, you would behold in whatmarvelous manner everything in this world has been brought into manifestation.The factory behind creation is beyond imagination; the whole universe is asingle thought in the mind of God! So simple, yet the galaxies are guided bymathematics inconceivable by man. Everything runs in perfect order. Whattremendous intelligence is manifested in creation! The Infinite is working ineverything. All the different eddies of motion called life are controlled bythat Cosmic Intelligence.Every hundred years a billion and a half persons leave this earth, and more thanthat many are born. What complexities of supply and demand are created thereby!Even so, the Divine Intelligence has given ample food to take care of humanneeds. Man alone is responsible for lack and misery on earth. By this time wecould have had a millennium—everyone healthy and supplied with all of life’snecessities, living in a happy and peaceful way in a wisely governed existence.But man’s selfishness, and power in the hands of the inept, destroys such apossibility. Abraham Lincoln expressed the highest ideal of government when hesaid it should be “of the people, by the people, and for the people.” He was adeeply spiritual man. Even so, he had to suffer because of the ignorance of afew.This World Is a Temporal PlaceIt is natural to wonder where exceptional men such as Lincoln, and departed dearones, once so tangible! have gone after death. Such questions arise in the mind,not to discourage you, but to awaken in you a realization of the temporaldream-nature of life. The Bhagavad Gita7 [part0041.html#footnote-199] tells us:“That which is night (of slumber) to all creatures is (luminous) wakefulness tothe man of self-mastery....The seeming state of wakefulness of the ordinary manis perceived by a sage to be, in reality, a state of delusive sleep.”Thus most people are sleeping soundly throughout this dream-life; only the manof realization is awake. He is not interested in the activities that engross theordinary man who busies himself seeking wealth and sense pleasures, and wastingtime in shallow social engagements. Man makes a nervous wreck of himselfpursuing the fleeting attractions of this world, whereas the joy and wonder ofGod, which is beyond description, would give him so much more: happiness andfulfillment unending!Only a little while you live as an individualized image in God’s dream-world.You are dreaming your mortal existence; it is part of God’s cosmic dream. Everyday you are living in this dream of physical being. Every night, in deep sleep,it is gone. And one day, when you awaken in God—who is your real Self—the dreamwill be gone forever.Seek the Lord Who Is Hiding Behind CreationUse your time rightly, to discover the factory of the Divine behind this world.Once for an entire day I beheld in vision the infinite wonders of creation, andI prayed:“O Father, when I was blind I found not a door that led to Thee. Thou hasthealed my eyes; now I discover doors everywhere: the hearts of flowers, thevoices of friendship, memories of lovely experiences. Each gust of my prayeropens a new entrance to the vast temple of Thy presence.”8[part0041.html#footnote-198]Be adamant, strong, and unflinching in your determination to discover the Onewho is hiding behind this creation. Snatch yourself away from the demands of theworld, and do not go to bed at night until you have consciously communed withGod. I seldom retire before four o’clock in the morning; only during the nightcan I find freedom from my responsibilities and be wholly with God.The ordinary man with his everyday responsibilities can be just as busy as thepresident of the United States. Busy, busy, busy! that is life’s demand. Youhave to reserve time each day to get away from the world and be with God.Control your life, and set aside time to practice meditation for communion withHim. Then everything in this world will be a wonder to you.As scientists made their discoveries by following certain disciplines andphysical laws, so will you find God without fail when you scientifically followspiritual laws. You are helping yourself in the highest way when you study andapply these laws as set forth in the Self-Realization Fellowship teachings.Forget not the things I have told you. “A word to the wise—those who arespiritually awakened—is sufficient.” Yet Jesus said: “The harvest truly isplenteous, but the laborers are few.”9 [part0041.html#footnote-197] If youreceive these teachings and practice them, you will realize every truth I havetold you. It is not complicated; I have given only those spiritual techniquesthat will enable you to perceive and commune with God. No matter how unpleasantyour circumstances in this world, when you discover God you will see Him workingthrough you and manifesting in everything, and you will be filled with His loveand joy.India’s rishis remind us that health and prosperity, material accomplishmentsand possessions, are not lasting. Why concentrate only on goals that areperishable? What is lasting is the ever-new joyous contact of God and theattainment of Self-realization—finding out who you are, knowing that the imageof God is within you. When you have that realization, you will be a satisfiedperson. The scriptures of India describe one who attains this state as a siddha,“successful one.” When I was teaching congregations of hundreds and thousands Iwas often called “successful.” That did not impress me. One may be recognized bythe whole world and yet be unknown to the only One whose attention matters; andhe who attracts the notice of God may be entirely unknown to the world. Whichwould you prefer? I wanted only the recognition of my Father. The acclaim of theworld can be so intoxicating that man forgets to cultivate the all-fulfillingapprobation of the Lord.It is natural for man to yearn for the role of king on this earthly stage, butif all were kings, there could be no play. Your part is just as important asanyone else’s. The point is that you must play your role according to the DivineDirector’s wish; when you live your part to please God, you will be successful.This should be the constant prayer in every human heart:“My Lord, work Thou through my hands; they were made to serve Thee and to pickflowers for Thy temple. Mine eyes were made to behold Thy presence in theflickering stars, in the eyes of soulful devotees; my feet were made to take meto Thy temples everywhere to sip the nectar of Thy sermons to seeking souls; myvoice was made only to speak of Thee. I taste wholesome food that I may bereminded of Thine all-nourishing goodness; I inhale the perfume of flowers thatI may breathe Thy fragrant presence there. I dedicate my thoughts, feelings, andlove to Thee. All my senses are in harmony with Thy celestial orchestra offragrance, beauty, and joy playing their refrain in the eternal symphony of thecosmos.“Lead me from darkness to light. Lead me from hatred to love. Lead me fromlimitations to Thine inexhaustible power; lead me from ignorance to wisdom. Leadme from suffering and death to everlasting life and enjoyment in Thee. Aboveall, lead me from the delusion of human attachment into realization of Thy loveeternal, which plays hide-and-seek with me in all forms of human love.“Father, Mother, Friend, Beloved God, reveal Thyself unto me! Leave me inignorance no longer. All delusion I cast from the sacred shrine of my soul. BeThou the only King sitting on the throne of my ambitions, the only Queen in thecastle of my love, the only Deity in the temple of my soul. Keep me awake in Thyconsciousness, that I may pray and demand unceasingly until Thou dost open alldoors into Thy home of wisdom, and there receive me, Thy prodigal child, andentertain me with the fatted calf of immortality and eternal joy.”[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0041.html#footnote-205-backlink] “The physical body, with roots of hair,cerebrospinal trunk, nerve branches, and boughs of hands and feet, bears aresemblance to an inverted tree....Some yogis do not cut their hair but keep itlong, to draw from the ether a greater quantity of cosmic rays.

We are visible to ourselvesevery day as a physical body. But there are many ways in which we manifest ouressential invisibility. For example, close your eyes. Your form is invisible toyou; how do you know you exist? You are aware of the body’s weight; you canhear, smell, taste, and touch. Nevertheless you are real to yourself only interms of ideas. You are an invisible nucleus around which many thoughts arerevolving. Now open your eyes. Are you the form that you see, or that innerbeing you were just now conscious of with eyes closed?The visible man is of little importance; the invisible self, or soul, is ofutmost importance. During sleep you are unaware of the visible man; but you areaware of yourself, for when you wake up you know whether you slept well orpoorly. Therefore your invisible self is real. Take that away and your outervisibility is meaningless. Without the invisible self the body would be asworthless as a corpse. The invisible man within is the real one. But strange tosay, man doesn’t try to analyze what that invisible self is. He is so interestedin the form he can see, thinking constantly about his physical appearance andwell-being, he doesn’t stop to reason out that the inner unseen self is thereality.Within the physical body, yet invisible to physical eyes, is an identical bodyof light, the astral encasement of the soul. If one of your fingers has been cutoff, you still feel as if that finger were there. Anyone who has lost a limbknows this sensation. There is an invisible astral counterpart for all thebodily parts. Behind your physical heart is an invisible heart. Without it, yourvisible heart would not beat. You have invisible organs of sight and hearing, aninvisible brain, invisible bones and nerves. These parts—tissues of light andenergy—constitute the astral body of the invisible man. The astral body looksexactly like the visible one, except that its form, being made of light andenergy, is exceedingly subtle.If you are physically afflicted you should not say, “My sight is gone,” or “Ihave lost a hand.” Your invisible eyes and hands are still present. Though yourphysical arm may be paralyzed, your invisible arm is not disabled. Never believethat the invisible organs are in any way affected by disease of the physicalorgans, because your negative thought would impede the flow of intelligent lifeenergy into the physical body parts.Electrical currents are passed through a wire. Which is more important, the wireor the electricity? The wire exists merely for the passage of the electricity;the electricity does not exist for the wire. So the body exists for the use ofthe invisible man, the soul, not he for the body. However, the physical bodymust be in a certain condition for the invisible self to remain there.What a pity that this invisible self is tied to the body! If it were not, wecould go walking on the water and fly in the sky and come back into the physicalbody again. The astral body of the invisible self has sensory perceptions muchgreater than those of its physical counterpart. Man has invented machines thatin some ways are better than the physical body, which has many limitations. Butwhen your consciousness of the invisible astral body is developed, you willrealize that it can hear what the physical ears cannot hear, and see what thephysical eyes cannot see. It can also smell, taste, and touch objects far beyondthe range of the physical senses. And you can make it large or small at will,just as pictures on a movie screen can be made large or small by the man in theprojection booth.Investigate the Electricity That Lights the Body BulbYou are always looking after the physical body-bulb. Have you never thought howwonderful it would be to investigate the electricity that lights the bulb?Visible man is composed basically of sixteen elements, chemicals that can bepurchased in a store. Your body is worth only about ninety cents; in depressiontimes even less! Why not cultivate a better acquaintance with the invisible man?It is he who has power and friends and love. Without him, visible man hasnothing but the chemicals of which he is made.Turn the spotlight of your attention inward, away from the limited visible man.The physical body has backaches and stomachaches; it suffers deterioration inold age; it is the nastiest little animal! always crying and whining forsomething. The visible man cannot bear a bad fall, and he sometimes shrinks ateven a pinprick; the invisible man is unhurt by anything. He is free. He canbanish all the troubles of the physical body. The invisible man within you iswhat you are. “The One who pervades all things is imperishable. Nothing haspower to destroy this Unchangeable Spirit.”1 [part0042.html#footnote-209]You think you are the body, but you are not. A piece of ice can be melted intoliquid and then made to disappear by evaporation. The process can be reversed,condensing the vapor into liquid and freezing the liquid into solid form as iceonce again. The ordinary man has not yet learned to perform similartransformations with his bodily atoms, but Christ showed that it could be done.Man’s Body Is Composed of 35 Thoughts of GodThe human body of 16 material elements is nothing more than a shadow of theinvisible man, who has two bodies—an astral form made of electrical currents,and a causal form made of ideas. Your astral form of light consists of 19elements and your invisible causal form is made of 35 thoughts—the 19 ideas thatproduced the 19 electrical elements of your astral body;2[part0042.html#footnote-208] and the 16 ideas that produced the 16 grossmaterial elements of your physical body. God first created the iron andpotassium and other chemical elements in idea; then He materialized them to makeyour physical body. The real you is invisible, because even your physical body,as well as everything else in creation, was first conceived in thought.So your body is essentially a causal form of 35 thoughts within an astral bodyof 19 elements of light and energy, which in turn is encased in a physical bodyof 16 chemical elements. When you die, the visible physical body will vanish,but the astral body of the invisible self within will be real to you; you willbe aware of your astral form. By higher spiritual advancement you will see thatyour subtle astral body can be reduced to 35 thoughts, and that yourconsciousness behind those 35 thoughts is the Reality; for your consciousness,or soul, is a spark of the cosmic consciousness of God.When you are viewing a motion picture you see many figures on the screen, but ifyou look up you see only one beam of light projecting those images. Similarly,from the brain flow five currents of energy, the vibratory creative elements ofearth, water, fire, air, and ether, which condense to materialize this physicalbody on the screen of creation.3 [part0042.html#footnote-207]Motion pictures used to be silent; now there is sound, and they areexperimenting with odors, so that when you see a garden on the screen you willalso smell the fragrance of the flowers. When those light-produced forms can bemade true to touch and taste also, you will have produced the fivefold aspectsof God’s creation. The five senses by which man apprehends creation have theircorrespondences in the five elemental electricities—ether (sound), air (touch),fire (sight), water (taste), and earth (smell)—from which creation wasmaterialized. Someday the whole world will appear to you as a kind of motionpicture—forms of light that are true to the five sensory perceptions. Theterrible things that are happening in the world now are distressingly real; butwhen you are able to behold them as creations of light and shadow, you willunderstand that they are only a show, a part of God’s play.You are only dreaming that you have a body of flesh. Your real self is light andconsciousness. You are not the physical body. The visibility of the body deludesour material consciousness. If you cultivate superconsciousness—awareness ofyour real self, the soul—you will realize that the body is simply a projectionof that invisible self within. Then you can do anything with the body. But don’ttry just yet to walk on water!In the motion-picture house you are engrossed in the images on the screen. Theylook so real! You are not conscious of the light overhead by which the imagesare being projected. But if you look up you can see that the visible isproceeding out of the invisible; the forms on the screen are all proceeding outof that one light from the projection booth. What is the difference between thelight and the pictures? If there were no light, could pictures have beenmaterialized? Similarly, if there were no invisible man, there would be novisible man. When the invisible man leaves the physical form, the bodydisintegrates. Those who understand the subtle relationship between the visibleand the invisible man can dematerialize and materialize the physical body atwill.4 [part0042.html#footnote-206] We are coming to that evolutionary periodduring which we will realize increasingly that we are really invisible beings,or souls.The Invisible Man Is Free From Suffering and DeathTo live only in the consciousness of this visible body of flesh is spirituallyretarding, for the body is subject to the sufferings of disease, injury,poverty, hunger, and death. We should not desire to think of ourselves as thisvisible, vulnerable, destructible body. The invisible man within us cannot behurt or killed. Should we not strive more to realize our unknown immortalnature? By increasing our knowledge of this invisible self we will be able tocontrol the man visible, as great masters do. Even when the visible man is indistress, he who is aware of his divine powers as the invisible man within canremain detached from physical suffering.How will you gain such control? First you must learn to live more in silence;you must learn to meditate. It may seem uninteresting at first; you have kept soclosely in touch with this visible body that you have difficulty in thinkingabout anything except its ceaseless troubles, desires, and demands. But make theeffort. Keeping your eyes closed, repeat again and again, “I am made in theimage of God. My life cannot be destroyed by any means. I am the invisible maneverlasting.”Everything Is the Result of an IdeaThat invisible man is made in the image of God, free as the Spirit is free. Inthe visible man lie all the troubles and limitations of the world. Whenever weare conscious of our bodies we are tied to the body’s limitations. Hence thegreat masters teach us to close our eyes and remind ourselves, by meditation onthe invisible self, that we are not restricted to what our physical bodies cando. I used to affirm with deep conviction: “I am not limited by my physicalbody. Wherever I want to go, I am instantly there.” You may say, “That is only athought.” Well, what is thought? Everything you see is the result of an idea.You could not visualize anything without thought. Invisible thought gives allthings their reality. Therefore if you can control your thought processes, youcan make anything visible; you can materialize it by the power of yourconcentration.Suppose you are sitting in silence and I ask you to concentrate on this templein which we are gathered. Again and again you try, until your mind has gone verydeep; then you will see the temple just as it appears now to your physical eyes.Invisible thoughts can be materialized into visual experiences.If you close your eyes, you cannot see your body, yet it is real to you. Whythink that the invisible self is unreal, just because you cannot see it? Inmeditation you peer into the darkness behind closed eyes and center yourattention on the soul, the invisible self within you. Learning to control yourthoughts and interiorize your mind, by scientific guru-given techniques ofmeditation, you will gradually develop spiritually: your meditations will deepenand your invisible self, the soul-image of God within, will become real to you.In this joyous awakening of Self-realization, the limited body consciousnessthat was so real becomes unreal; and you know that you have found your trueinvincible self and its oneness with God.Realize Your Immortality NowYou will also understand how the invisible man is “tied” to the physical body—byattachments, the mental and emotional cords of desires for certain experienceson the physical plane. When by deeper meditation you can untie those cords, hewill be free and you will know that you are a real image of God. Seek out thatinvisible man who is held captive in the jungle of physical sensations andmatter.If you once understood the invisible man and the miracle of his outer physicalbody, his secondary body of light, and his inner body of ideas, you wouldrealize what a wonderful creation you are! Concentrate on that invisible you.The visible man is a delusion; the invisible man within is real. When you knowthis you will know that you are not bones and flesh; you are the indestructibleinvisible man.You cannot die! Dwell no more on thoughts of growing older and being ready forthe grave. You are only getting ready for your immortal state! Nothing dies. Theideational blueprint of your body is always present in the ether. You feel thatyour loved ones who pass on are gone forever because you haven’t the power ofconcentration necessary to behold them in their subtle forms in the astral worldwhere they are. Keep your mind on these truths, repeating them to yourselfwhenever you have a quiet moment, “I am a prototype of God’s thought. I ameternal, ever roaming in the kingdom of God.” You are that deathless invisibleman, and ever will be. Why not realize your immortality now?Your two physical eyes deceive you into thinking that this world of duality isreal. Open your spiritual eye and behold your invisible form. If in the innersilence your spiritual eye is open, the invisible becomes visible. Whenever youare thinking, dreaming, or concentrating deeply, you are that invisible man. Heis real; the visible man is the shadow. Forget the shadow and remember the real.Be one with the invisible man—the reflection of God.[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0042.html#footnote-209-backlink] Bhagavad Gita II:17.2 [part0042.html#footnote-208-backlink] See astral body[part0074.html#_idTextAnchor085] in glossary.3 [part0042.html#footnote-207-backlink] The cosmic vibration, or Aum, structuresall physical creation, including the human body, through the manifestation offive tattwas (elements): earth, water, fire, air, and ether. These areintelligent vibratory forces. Without the earth element there would be no stateof solid matter; without the water element, no liquid state; without the airelement, no gaseous state; without the fire element, no heat; without the etherelement, no background on which to produce the cosmic motion picture show. Thecreative cosmic vibration enters the body of man through the medulla, and isthen divided into the five elemental currents by the action of the five lowerchakras, or centers: the coccygeal (earth), sacral (water), lumbar (fire),dorsal (air), and cervical (ether).4 [part0042.html#footnote-206-backlink] Great masters who have attainedGod-realization are able to arrange the atoms at will to create any form theywish. Paramahansa Yogananda related in his autobiography that his beloved guru,Swami Sri Yukteswar, appeared before him in the flesh three months after hisdeath. Not only was it a visible form; Paramahansaji mentions embracing his guru“with an octopus grip,” and detecting “the same faint, fragrant, natural odorwhich had been characteristic of his body before.” Further, guru and discipletalked with each other at length, as described in Autobiography of a Yogi,chapter 43, “The Resurrection of Sri Yukteswar.” (Publisher’s Note)"},{"pageContent":"What Are Ghosts?Self-Realization Fellowship Temple, Hollywood, California, July 22, 1945There are all kinds of tales about ghosts, devils, witches, vampires; and not afew persons have claimed to have had various experiences with such creatures. Ofthe several cases that have come to my attention, most of the persons involvedsuffered from overly strong and diseased imaginations. One of them, a woman, hadchanced to read a book about vampires, and her imaginings were so vivid that shebelieved one of them was sucking her blood away each night. Whenever she visitedme, she became well; but the idea of the nightly presence of a vampire was sostrong in her that after a time she would become ill again. She diedprematurely, destroyed by her own thoughts.1 [part0043.html#footnote-230]In the sixteenth century, belief in witchcraft was widespread, and hundreds ofpersons suspected of being witches were falsely accused of being in league withthe devil and were put to death. Joan of Arc was burned at the stake as onebewitched. Even Jesus Christ, who was healing the sick and doing only good, wasaccused of being in touch with Beelzebub. It is true that at various times evilspirits in possessed persons recognized Jesus and spoke to him, saying, “Let usalone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come todestroy us? I know thee who thou art: the Holy One of God.”2[part0043.html#footnote-229] Jesus himself spoke of Satan3[part0043.html#footnote-228] and of evil spirits, which he exorcised from manypersons, in one case casting the evil spirits into the bodies of a herd ofswine.4 [part0043.html#footnote-227]There is another world, the astral, hidden behind this universe. Its inhabitantsare garbed in an astral form made of light. Lacking a physical body, they are“ghosts,” invisible to us. Ordinarily they are confined to their own sphere,just as we are limited to our own physical world. If it were a simple matter forthe ill-intentioned among astral beings to penetrate the earth plane and hurtus, we would be living in terror all the time. There is enough horror already onthis earth of ours. Are not millions of deadly germs floating around? CertainlyGod would not add the interference of spooks to our sufferings!There are, however, a few astral beings known as “tramp souls.” They areearthbound because of strong attachments to the world, and are desirous ofentering a physical form for sense enjoyments. Such beings are usually unseen;and they have no power to affect the ordinary person. Tramp souls dooccasionally succeed in entering and taking possession of someone’s body andmind, but only when such a person is mentally unstable or has weakened his mindby keeping it often blank or unthinking. It is like leaving a car unlocked withthe key in the ignition; some vagrant may get in and drive off. Tramp souls wanta free ride in someone else’s physical-body vehicle—anyone’s—having lost theirown that they were so attached to. It was in such cases of possession that Jesusexorcised the vagrant spirits. Tramp souls cannot stand the high vibration ofspiritual thoughts and consciousness. Sincere seekers after God who practicescientific methods of prayer and meditation need never fear such beings. God isthe Spirit of all spirits. No harm from negative spirits can come to one whosethoughts are on God.The Triune Nature of ManTo understand better what astral beings are, let us first understand what weare. When God created us, we existed first only as consciousness. We were acreation of His mind. Is it not true that whenever you create something new, theinitial step is to visualize a model of it in your mind? Then you gathertogether the materials, and finally you construct the tangible image of youridea. In the same manner, we and everything in creation are triune: mental (theidea), astral (the building material), and physical (the gross end-product).The physical body is made of 16 elements. How God combined the chemicalmaterials of physical elements to express intelligence is a marvel!Nevertheless, this body is anything but perfect. We can conceive of a muchbetter one! I would like to create a body that would be like asbestos, able togo through fire and not burn; one in which there could be no broken bones, nounpleasant coughing. The physical body has pains and aches: its “spark plugs”are often “missing”; first one part and then another gives out, and finally theheart fails.Americans like to get a new car every year, but they have to keep this oldbody-model sixty or seventy years! Yet even when it is falling apart, still youwant to hang onto the model you have, until finally the Lord says, “Come on, getout of it!” Then you spring from the worn-out physical form and see that you areencased in a luminous body, an astral body of light and energy.5[part0043.html#footnote-226] You rejoice to find that you can hear, you can see,you can touch; and that your new form possesses no bones to be broken, no fleshto be hurt.Our astral body is composed of 19 elements, which are mental, emotional, andlifetronic. These are intelligence; ego; feeling; mind (sense consciousness);five instruments of knowledge (the subtle powers behind the physical senseorgans of sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch); five instruments of action(the powers for the executive abilities to procreate, excrete, talk, walk, andexercise manual skill); and five instruments of life force (those empowered toperform the crystallizing, assimilating, eliminating, metabolizing, andcirculatory functions of the physical body).These are all subtly made. We can hear, smell, taste, touch, and see in thedream world through the power that is in the five senses. And in the astralworld, even without the physical organs of the ears, eyes, nose, tongue, andskin, we still have with us the power of all five sense perceptions. The astralbody is weightless and travels as light travels. You can at will make the astralbody very small like an atom or you can make it very large. Why not? God, thedivine operator of the cosmic movie of creation, can enlarge or reduce the sizeof the picture on the screen. He is the projectionist, running the film from thebooth of eternity. You are an individualized expression of His infinite light.Your astral body is therefore much freer from the cosmic limitations that sostrongly bind the physical form.But God had first to think of what materials He wanted to put into the physicaland astral bodies before He actually created them. We therefore have also acausal or idea body of 35 elements: the 16 ideas that go to make up the elementsof the physical body, and the 19 ideas that constitute the elements of theastral body. From the causal thought-forms the astral body’s five instruments oflife force make visible the astral body of light and the physical body of grossmatter. The following experiment illustrates the idea. Close your eyes andvisualize a horse on the left. At first your concept is fuzzy, but if I suggesta white horse, you can more easily visualize it. Now think of a black horse onthe right side. You are creating mental or causal images. Switch them about sothat the white horse is on the right side. If you can visualize a little morestrongly, you will be able to see these thought-forms as real images. That iswhat you do in a dream: your mind is more concentrated then, causing yourthought-forms to become visible to you. Dreams and visions are astral inessence, being composed of light and energy. Could you actually make the astralimages of the black and white horses true to the physical senses, you would havematerialized a physical creation.So essentially we are made of 35 ideas, which make up the ideational or causalbody of man. Encased within the 35 thoughts is the spirit of God, which iscalled the soul. Just as one flame emerges from the tiny openings of a gasburner as many individual flames, so are we all one light, flowing from God intomany bodies.At Death We Are Still Encased in theAstral and Causal BodiesWhen you die, your physical body of 16 elements disintegrates, but the 19elements of your astral body remain intact. Where, then, are all those souls whohave left this earth? They are roaming in the ether. “That is impossible,” yousay. So let us make a comparison. If a primitive tribesman came here and I toldhim that music is audible in the ether, he would laugh at me, or perhaps becomefrightened; but if I then brought a radio and tuned in a station where music wasplaying, he would no longer be able to deny the truth of my statement. I couldsimilarly show you right now that astral beings are roaming in the ether, andyou couldn’t deny it. The astral world is right here, just behind the grossvibration of the physical cosmos.If you were to behold the multitude of astral beings in the ether around you atthis moment, many of you would be afraid; and some of you would try to seekamong them your departed loved ones. If you concentrate deeply at the spiritualeye you can view with inner vision that luminous world in which are living allthe souls who have gone on to the astral plane. In human beings the heart actsas a receiving instrument and the spiritual eye as a broadcasting station. Evenif you cannot see your lost beloved ones, if you can calmly concentrate yourfeeling on the heart, you can become aware of the reassuring presence of thosedear to you who are now in astral form, enjoying their freedom from fleshthralldom.I see many astral beings who have left the material plane, but they cannot seeme. I don’t make myself visible to them, but I can behold them if I so desire.6[part0043.html#footnote-225]Therefore, we are not fully released at death when we depart from the physicalform. Our souls are still encased in the subtle astral and ideational bodies. Itis only when man dons a physical form that he becomes a visible being in thisworld. After the death of his physical body, he remains in the astral form as a“ghost”: an intelligent, invisible being, with essentially the same mentalityand characteristics he had on earth. Inhabitants of the astral realms can ofcourse see one another in their luminous bodies. But astral beings are notordinarily visible to us on earth unless we know how to perceive the astralworld through the spiritual eye. When souls shed the astral body and go into amental form in the causal world7 [part0043.html#footnote-224] they are notnonentities, but they do become truly invisible, even as ideas are invisible.Jesus said, “Destroy this [body] temple and in three days I will raise it up.”8[part0043.html#footnote-223] He meant that he had to divest himself of thephysical, astral, and mental bodies (by casting out all vestiges of attachmentto a form) to become one with Spirit. It took three distinct efforts to do this.If a departed soul has unfinished desires created while on the earth plane, itcontinues to feel in the astral those desires and the wish to express itselfthrough a material body. And so that soul in its astral vehicle is drawn againinto a united sperm and ovum cell and is once more in a physical form.The Intelligence in Prana Creates the Physical BodyThe prana that permeates the physical body is intelligent life force(“lifetrons”). The electricity that illuminates the light bulb does not createthe bulb; but the electricity or life force in the united human sperm and ovumcells guides the embryonic and subsequent development of the entire human body.Manifesting as the aforementioned five life forces of the astral body, it is anintelligent or consciously directed force.It is unwise to ascribe to yourself permanently any defect of your body. Supposeyou have lost an arm in this life, and the thought of that loss becomes soimpinged on your consciousness that you think you can never again have the useof that arm. When you are reborn the next time, you bring with you thatconsciousness of a missing arm; and if that negative thought is strong enough itmay inhibit the creative action of the intelligent life force that grows thearms of your new body. You should therefore never identify yourself with theflaws of your physical form. They do not belong to you, for you are the pure,perfect image of God—the soul.So you see, before you took on this physical form you were a ghost, and when youdie you will become a ghost again. We are also ghosts when we sleep, for insleep we are not aware of ourselves as a physical body at all. Since you are aghost when you are asleep, and you will be one after death, why be afraid ofghosts? That is what you were and that is what you are going to be. The onlydifference is that when you enter the astral world at death you cannot create atwill a physical body like the one you now have. Only great masters who haveattained oneness with the Divine Creator can do so. Spiritually advanced soulscan condense the subtle vibrations of the astral vehicle into a tangible body.Death Should Not Be FearedWe fear death because of pain, and because of the thought that we may becomeobliterated. This idea is erroneous. Jesus showed himself in a physical form tohis disciples after his death. Lahiri Mahasaya returned in the flesh the nextday after he had entered mahasamadhi.9 [part0043.html#footnote-222] They provedthat they were not destroyed. Just because instances of those who have masteredthe cosmic laws are few, one should not say that their testimony is not true.You should not ignore the divine demonstrations of Jesus and myparam-paramguru10 [part0043.html#footnote-221] Babaji; nor can I put aside theevidence of what I have seen—my resurrected guru, Sri Yukteswarji11[part0043.html#footnote-220]—or what I have experienced in myself. “This soul inessence, the reflection of the Spirit, never undergoes the throes of death orthe pangs of birth; nor, having once known existence, is it ever nonexistent.This soul was never born; it is everlastingly living, untouched by themaya-magic of change. The soul is ever constant through all cycles of bodilydisintegrations.”12 [part0043.html#footnote-219]Many times when some disciple living far away has been ill or dying, he hasdrawn my astral body there through his devotion. One such incident happenedhere. Seva Devi was a very devoted student. She became extremely ill, but shenever complained about it to anyone. She knew her time had come to leave thisearth. One day when I visited her in Los Angeles she said to me, “Please don’thold me here.”13 [part0043.html#footnote-218] Later on, I was staying in theSelf-Realization Fellowship Hermitage in Encinitas for a time. I had been givena radio and was waking up early in the mornings to listen to broadcasts fromIndia. One morning I suddenly felt intuitively the subtle astral vibration ofSeva Devi; she drew my astral body to her through her devotion. My physical bodywas as dead. I was told later that Seva Devi exclaimed, just before her passing,“Swamiji is here!” She was aware of being consciously ushered by me into theother world.14 [part0043.html#footnote-217] Some time afterward I saw herglowing astral form; she was sitting in one of my classes, just as real as sheused to appear in life. If anyone had touched me at that time, he would haveseen her too. However, one who is in that state of astral consciousness does notusually allow others to touch him.We have passed through death and rebirth so many times, why be afraid of death?It comes to free us. You shouldn’t wish for death, but be comforted in therealization that it is our escape from so many troubles; it is a pension afterthe hard work of life. I am making death very charming!People also fear death because they have been in this cage of flesh so long thatthey feel timid about leaving its security. But it is foolish to be afraid. Justthink, no more repaired tires on the body vehicle, no more patchwork living.Since it is the Lord’s desire that we should have this old model until deathcomes, we have to keep it and take care of it. But I wish the Lord would giveeveryone the ability to go into samadhi and change his bodily vehicle as easilyas did rishi Narada. He was singing of God in divine ecstatic communion; andwhen he returned to ordinary consciousness he saw he had shed his old body andhad “reincarnated” in a fresh new youthful form. That is the highest form oftransmigration.15 [part0043.html#footnote-216]There is in India a story of a dying youth who, hearing the sobs of grief aroundhim, cried:Insult me not with your cries of sympathyWhen I soarTo the land of eternal light and love;It is I who should feel for you.For me, disease, shattering of bones,Sorrow, excruciating heartaches no more.I dream joy, I glide in joy, I breathe in joy evermore.You don’t know what is going to come to you in this world; you have to go onliving and worrying. Those who die are pitying us; they are blessing us. Whyshould you grieve for them? I told this to a woman who had lost her son. When Ifinished explaining, she dried her tears immediately and said, “Never beforehave I felt such peace. I am glad to know that my son is free. I thoughtsomething awful had happened to him.”It Is Possible to Enter and Leave the Body ConsciouslyMany spiritually developed persons can see their own astral body. St. John saysin the Bible, “And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead.”16[part0043.html#footnote-215] When your astral body ascends, or leaves the body,at death, you see your physical body as dead. That same experience occurs whenadvanced yogis transcend the physical body at will. Thus John, though living,saw his material form as dead during the samadhi he describes. It is fun to getin and out of the body this way. But many persons who think they can do so areonly imagining it. Just because you think it is so doesn’t make it so. You haveto know the technique.One man in New York came to me and assured me that he could travel astrally. “Idon’t think you can,” I said. “You are only imagining you can do so.” Still heinsisted that I test him. “All right,” I agreed, “go downstairs astrally andtell me what is in the restaurant there.” He was quiet for a moment; then hetold me, “There is a big piano in the right-hand corner.” I knew he wasimagining it, for I had observed that his breathing was normal and so was hispulse.17 [part0043.html#footnote-214] “On the contrary,” I said, “I think youwill find there two women sitting at a table.” He laughed at me. Then we bothwent down into the restaurant. No piano stood in the corner, but two women wereseated at a table there. At last he understood that he had been fooled by hisown imagination.Often I see with the inner astral vision happenings in the war in Europe, but itseems like a picture show. The world was meant to entertain us, not to tortureus. God has made His motion picture of creation very complex, full of contrastsof good and evil. When you go to a movie you like to see lots of excitement.Think how many times you have gone to view a murder mystery; and when the movieended you said to yourself, “That was a good show!” Learn to look upon thismovie of life with the same sense of detachment and enjoyment.There is a lesson to be learned from the fact that we are now encaged in thehuman body, and that at night and when we die we become ghosts. We must learn toknow our ghostly nature, our invisible, powerful nature. But you cannot do so ifyou are always concentrating on the body: “I have a headache, I want this andthat, I dislike spinach.” Preoccupation with material concerns is what you mustovercome. How can you do this? Make God the first thought in your life. So longas you keep Him in second place He will not come to you. Gold, wine, and sexwere created to hold you to this world; the Lord uses them as tests to seewhether you prefer them to His love.The Power of Black Magic Is in Your ThoughtIn addition to the fear of ghosts, some people have a dread of black magic andother black arts. Many people tell me that somebody they know is using blackmagic on them. I say to them, “You are sitting in the castle of God. No one canharm you if you truly believe in God.” But when you believe in the negativethought that somebody is injuring you, you give him the power to do so. Supposesomeone is sending you a wrong thought, and you accept it; it will hurt you. Butyou do not have to accept evil ideas. Don’t be afraid of malicious persons; noone can affect you unless you are fearful. Fear and keeping the mind blank allowevil to enter; but when you say, “God is with me,” nothing but good can come toyou from the thoughts of others. Wrap yourself in the thought of God. His holyName is the Power of all powers. Like a shield it deflects all negativevibrations.The Cosmic War of Good and EvilWhy be concerned about the negligible threat of the powers of tramp-soul ghosts,or practitioners of the black arts? At every moment a far greater danger to ourhappiness and well-being exists right within us and around us. Two forces arefighting—the one to save us, and the other to hurt us. We are caught in thecosmic war between good and evil.This world is ruled by invisibilities or ghosts: God the Father, ChristConsciousness, the seven spirits before the throne of God;18[part0043.html#footnote-213] and Satan and his legion of evil powers. The sevenspirits before the throne of God are the principal intelligent forces ofcreation: Holy Ghost (the prime creative vibratory power of God, Aum, or Amen)and its six individualized creative powers that structure and maintain thephysical, astral, and causal universes and the physical, astral, and causalbodies of man.Originally, Satan was an archangel.19 [part0043.html#footnote-212] He was giventhe power to create the world according to God’s plan. After he had completedhis assignment, he was to go back to God, as God intended all creation to returnto Him. But if this intelligent power, personified in the scriptures as Satan,were to retire into Spirit, creation would disappear. To prevent this, Satanimplanted evil (that is, material) desires in man, fulfillment of which wouldnecessitate man’s return to earth again and again, thus keeping the machinery ofcreation going. In this way the devil tries to see to it that man doesn’t get achance to go back to God.There is a great tug-of-war between the devil and God. One cannot dismiss theproblem by thinking that Satan is a mere delusion. God would be very ignorant ifHe didn’t know about the evil in the world. And why did Jesus say: “Get theebehind me, Satan” and “Deliver us from evil” if there is no Satan? Why is itnecessary to pray to God at all if there is no devil? Evil does exist.When the Lord created man, He created the devil too. Satan, with his power ofmaya, exists in order to test the children of God. Unless fire melts iron, steelcannot be forged. When disease or suffering comes, you should realize that it isa test of God’s maya. You must pass these tests. You must not be upset by them.Though Jesus was suffering on the cross, he surmounted that divine test. Manygreat souls have died of terrible diseases and suffering. Saint Teresa of Avilawas afflicted with tuberculosis, and yet she said, “I don’t want the Lord toshorten my trials. I want to suffer bravely and work as long as I can.” And whenher body died she was lifted up in Christ.This creation is the Lord’s hobby. But I constantly plead with Him, “Why do Youhave such a hobby? Why do You give us such troubles?” Our earth is one of theworst places in creation. There are far better dwelling places than this. Butthough God allows troubles to exist, He also tries to help us out of them. Godand His angels and millions of good spirits are trying to establish their orderof divine harmony on earth. Every beneficial quality is created by a goodspirit. Good spirits are constantly casting the seeds of helpful thoughts intothe soil of your mind. At the same time, Satan, the king of darkness, with hisevil spirits is creating disorder and trouble in the world. Who but Satancreated disease germs? There have been various plagues, then tuberculosis, andnow the latest destroyer is cancer—all diabolical methods of torturing humanbeings. But God is inspiring many researchers to find new ways to banishdisease.The Temptation of Adam and EveTo hold man to earth life, Satan created sex; that temptation has been with mansince the beginning of time. The Lord created man and woman by will power; theirbodies were materializations of His divine wisdom and love.20[part0043.html#footnote-211] Man and woman originally had the same power as Heto create children by mental fiat. Adam and Eve were empowered by Him topropagate the species by immaculate or divine means. As my guru Sri Yukteswarjiexplained, the evil force, Satan, tempted Eve to taste the fruit (sex) in themidst of the garden (body).21 [part0043.html#footnote-210] God had said that theoriginal man and woman were to enjoy all the sensations of the tree of life(astral spinal centers of consciousness and energy that enliven the body and thesenses) except the experience of sex, which is in the midst, or center, of thebody garden. The “serpent” that tempted Eve is the coiled-up spinal energy thatfeeds and stimulates the sex nerves. When the emotion or Eve-consciousness inany human being is overpowered by the sex impulse, his reason or Adam alsosuccumbs.Sexual pleasure is a delusive counterpart of God’s bliss. Thus when sex isdivorced from faithful love, and used only to gratify lustful instincts, itbecomes a tool of the devil to keep man’s consciousness locked in the senses,unable to experience God-consciousness, or realization of the Self as Spirit:ever-existing, ever-conscious, ever-new Joy. Sex and desire for wine andmoney—these are the counterfeits created by Satan to displace the ecstasy of thesoul. When Adam and Eve tasted of the sex sensation, they fell from Paradise;they lost that divine consciousness by which they could feel their oneness withGod in soul ecstasy, and they were forced out of the garden of Eden. Ever since,human beings have had to reproduce their kind the sexual way, like the animals.Women give birth in a troublesome and painful manner. Then, too, husband andwife have to accept what they get; if a bad child comes, they must rear it.Originally they were able to create what they wanted, through the power of mind,just as God does. What happy days of pristine innocence!Listen Only to the Voice of GodIn the ultimate sense even Satan is really a tool of God. Satan fails to keephis promises to man, and then the disillusioned person seeks the faithful Lord.Why wait for disillusionment? I urge you not to put all your eggs of happinessin one basket. When you are physically strong and well and reasonably contented,suddenly pain comes and you think, “My goodness, what is this?” Self-RealizationFellowship teaches you not to put all your hopes for happiness in the frailbasket of your body and the pleasures of this world. How? By teaching you tomaster the body; and, above all, by teaching you to meditate.Listen to the voice of God through your good thoughts. God and His angelicspirits are creating these good thoughts; the devil is creating his own kind ofthoughts. Every time a bad thought comes, cast it out. Then Satan can’t doanything to you. But as soon as you think wrongly, you go toward Satan. You areconstantly moving back and forth between good and evil; to escape, you must gowhere Satan will be unable to reach you: deep in the heart of God.[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0043.html#footnote-230-backlink] In the presence of a God-consciousmaster such as Paramahansa Yogananda, receptive devotees are often healed ofmental or physical illness.

That great master stands beforemy eyes, telling Orient and Occident: “Come together! My body was born in theEast; my spirit and message traveled to the West.” In Christ’s birth as anAsiatic, and his acceptance by Western peoples as their guru, is a divineimplication that East and West should unite by exchanging their finestdistinctive features. It is part of the drama of God that the West was meant tohave material power, and the East, spiritual power, so that amity might comethrough an interchange of their characteristic qualities. The spiritual freedomof the East overrides material suffering. The West needs that kind of spiritualfreedom; God’s Western children, being more fortunate physically and materially,need to develop spiritually and to receive the spiritual illumination of theEast. And the East needs Western material development; God’s Eastern childrenshould welcome the help of the West, that they may industrialize Asia, and thusenable her to develop and use her resources to fullest advantage.The American way of living progressively, plus the spirituality of India—youcannot beat that combination. India is the melting pot of religions; America,the melting pot of nations. America became great because of her love of libertyand because she welcomed all races to her shores—she absorbed the best of allnations. No other country was founded on and has grown on such wonderful ideals;the freedom and exceptional way of life that have been created in America bythese ideals must never be lost.Many in the West believe that Easterners are materially poor because they arespiritually wealthy. This is not true. And many Easterners believe thatWesterners are spiritually poor because they are materially rich. This is notthe case either. The truth is that we human beings become too one-sided; we needto seek a balance by drawing the best from one another.Jesus is a divine colossus standing between Orient and Occident, telling Eastand West to exchange their better qualities. Can you see him there? I see him.He urges the West to spiritualize itself and the East to industrializeitself—the East to accept the Western missionaries of science and industry, andthe West to accept the Eastern missionaries of the Spirit. To the West he says:“Love your Eastern brothers. I came from the Orient.” To the East he pleads:“Love your Western brothers; they have received and loved me, an Oriental.”Isn’t that a beautiful thought? It would make a magnificent picture.Christ is not the property of either East or West—an East-West bond ismanifested in his life. He belongs to both, and to all the world. Hisuniversality is what makes him so wonderful. Jesus took the body of an Orientalso that in being accepted as guru by the Occidental he would therebysymbolically draw East and West together. Those in the West who have adoptedChrist as their own should remember that he was an Oriental. Love and sympathyfor Jesus should be expanded into love and sympathy for all Orientals, and forall the world.God does not prefer Orientals or Occidentals. He loves those who manifest Hisspiritual qualities. Why, then, was it ordained by God that Christ, a greatsavior of mankind, came out of the East? God wanted to come with thedowntrodden, to show the transcendence of Spirit over matter. We should notconclude that it is necessary to be poor to be Christlike; if Jesus had come ina prosperous country, it would be equally foolish to reason that ChristConsciousness can be attained through material things, or that God favors thematerially rich. A balance between spirituality and material development isnecessary.The ideals of Christ are the ideals of the scriptures of India. The precepts ofJesus are analogous to the highest Vedic teachings, which were in existence longbefore the advent of Jesus. This does not take away from the greatness ofChrist; it shows the eternal nature of truth, and that Jesus incarnated on earthto give to the world a new expression of Sanatan Dharma (eternal religion, theeternal principles of righteousness).1 [part0044.html#footnote-248] In the Bookof Genesis we find an exact parallel of the older Hindu concept of the genesisof our universe. The Ten Commandments of Moses, many of the Biblical legends andfigures and rituals, the miracles performed by Christ, the very basics ofChristian doctrine, all have concomitance with the earlier Vedic literature ofIndia. The teachings of Christ in the New Testament and of Krishna in theBhagavad Gita have an exact correspondence.2 [part0044.html#footnote-247]The True Nature of the Star of the EastThe parallelisms of Christ’s teachings with Yoga-Vedanta doctrines stronglysupport the records known to exist in India, which state that Jesus lived andstudied there during fifteen of the unaccounted-for years of his life—no mentionis made of him in the New Testament from his twelfth to thirtieth year. Jesusjourneyed to India to return the visit of the three “wise men from the east” whocame to pay homage to him at his birth.3 [part0044.html#footnote-246] They wereguided to the Christ Child by the divine light of a star—not a physicalluminary, but the star of the omniscient spiritual eye. This “third eye” can beseen within the forehead, between the eyebrows, by the deeply meditatingdevotee. The spiritual eye is a metaphysical telescope through which one can seeto infinity in all directions simultaneously, beholding with omnipresentspherical vision whatever is happening in any point of creation. The spiritualeye has been mentioned in the teachings of India, and Jesus referred to it, too:“The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy wholebody shall be full of light.”4 [part0044.html#footnote-245] Brought thus to thestable in Bethlehem by the guiding light of the spiritual eye, the Wise Menrecognized and honored the infant Christ for the great soul and divineincarnation that he was. During the unknown period of his life Jesus repaidtheir visit.Even in the name and title of Jesus we find Sanskrit words with a correspondingsound and meaning. The words Jesus and Isa (pronounced “Isha”) are substantiallythe same. Is, Isa, and Iswara all refer to the Lord, or Supreme Being. “Jesus”derives from the Greek form of the name Joshua or Jeshua, a contraction ofJehoshua, “help of Jehovah” or “Savior.”5 [part0044.html#footnote-244]The title “Christ” is also found in India—it was perhaps given to Jesus there—inthe word “Krishna,” which sometimes I purposely spell “Christna” to show thecorrelation. “Christ” and “Krishna” are titles signifying divinity, meaning thatthese two avatars were one with God. While residing in physical form theirconsciousness expressed oneness with the Christ Consciousness (Sanskrit KutasthaChaitanya), the Intelligence of God omnipresent in creation.6[part0044.html#footnote-243] This consciousness is also called the “onlybegotten son of God” because it is the sole perfect reflection in creation ofthe Uncreated Infinite.To understand what Christ Consciousness means, consider the contrast betweenyour consciousness and that of a little ant. The ant’s awareness is limited bythe minuscule size of his body; your consciousness resides throughout yourrelatively capacious form. If anyone touches any part of your body you are awareof it. Creation is the body of God, and His consciousness omnipresent therein iscalled the Christ Consciousness. He is aware of whatever we do within Hisuniversal form, just as we are conscious of our little selves. Through onenesswith that Christ Consciousness Jesus was able to know, without being told, thatLazarus was dead.The wonders of God’s creation cannot be discovered by a cow; it is the uniquepotential of human beings to attain the omniscience of oneness with ChristConsciousness. I ask those who do not believe in God: “Whence came theintelligence in man and in the universe, if it is not produced in some divine‘Factory’ hidden behind the ether?” Such mysteries prompted Einstein to say thatspace looks very suspicious. Space is concealing God; His Intelligence is hiddenthere, for out of the “nothingness” of space comes everything.Being one with this Intelligence, which guides every atom in creation, Jesuscould materialize his form anywhere he wished. And he can still do so, just ashe used to appear every night to St. Francis in Assisi. Jesus was conscious notonly of his microcosmic physical form, but also of all creation as hismacrocosmic body; he could truthfully say: “I and my Father are one.”7[part0044.html#footnote-242] He experienced his presence in all atoms, even asdoes his Father. Jesus alluded to the omnipresent Christ Consciousness when hesaid, “Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fallon the ground without [the sight of] your Father.”8 [part0044.html#footnote-241]Christ came at a critical time in history, when the world was sorely in need ofspiritual hope and regeneration.9 [part0044.html#footnote-240] His message wasnot intended to foster multifarious sects, each claiming him as their own. Hiswas a universal message of unity, one of the grandest ever given. He remindedmankind that it is written in the scriptures, “Ye are gods”;10[part0044.html#footnote-239] and St. John voiced the inspiration and spirit ofChrist’s teaching when he said, “But as many as received him [the ChristConsciousness manifested in Jesus and in all creation], to them gave he power tobecome the sons of God.”11 [part0044.html#footnote-238] Was there ever a greatermessage? Jesus assured the downtrodden, the white and the dark man, the Orientaland the Occidental, that they are all children of God; whoever is pure in heart,no matter what his race or color, can receive the Lord.The charcoal and the diamond receive the same rays of the sun, but the diamondreflects their radiance. So, both in the Orient and the Occident, those who havediamond mentalities shall reflect God and be called the sons of God, and thosewho keep themselves dark with evil qualities shall not be able to reflect Hislight.Train Your Heart to Feel the Brotherhood of ManAll mankind should open its heart to Jesus’ great message: “[God] hath made ofone blood all nations of men.”12 [part0044.html#footnote-237] That is the Christinspiration I love so much. I want to make that message a living reality, togive it a practical application. Color prejudice is the most foolish of allman’s displays of ignorance. Color is only skin deep. God gave darker skinpigment to races that originally lived under climatic conditions requiringgreater protection from the sun, a purely practical measure; therefore white,olive, yellow, red, or black skin is nothing to be particularly proud of. Afterall, the soul wears a bodily overcoat of one color in one lifetime and otherhues in other incarnations. So the color of one’s complexion is a verysuperficial thing. To have any color prejudice is to discriminate against God,who is sitting in the hearts of all the red, white, yellow, olive, and blackpeoples of the world. Besides, it is well to remember that whoever hates anyrace will surely reincarnate in that bodily form; thus does the karmic law forceman to overcome his soul-stifling prejudices. Train your heart to feel thebrotherhood of man—that is most important.Although Jesus’ teachings were preordained to establish their strongestfoundation in the West, he chose an incarnation in an Oriental body, and in theJewish race, which has had a long history of persecution, because he wanted todemonstrate the folly of judging others according to distinctions of race andcolor. True Christianity must be lived; racial divisions must be banished.Prejudices and lack of real brotherhood are causes of war and disunion amongGod’s children. We must work at eradicating all incitements to war; in hate andprejudice lie bombs and misery. Jesus warned: “...for all they that take thesword shall perish with the sword.”13 [part0044.html#footnote-236] It is not thesword, but the practice of Christ principles that shall ultimately free theworld. In the highest sense, God alone protects you. You can best help thisworld by ideal living, as taught by Christ and all spiritually enlightened ones.Above all else, love God; don’t you see that the whole answer is in His hands?When He will push aside the screen of mystery, you will see the answer to allthat was theretofore obscure and unfathomable.Some Westerners consider the Hindus heathens; they don’t know that many Hindusconsider Westerners heathens also—ignorance is fifty-fifty everywhere. I amsometimes asked if I believe in Jesus. I reply: “Why such a question? We inIndia reverence Jesus and his teachings, perhaps more than you do.”In order to love Christ you must live what he taught, you must follow theexample of his life. Jesus said: “...whosoever shall smite thee on thy rightcheek, turn to him the other also.”14 [part0044.html#footnote-235] India haspracticed this teaching more than any other nation. Many who call themselvesChristian do not even apply it; they say that it is a beautiful philosophy, butif you were to slap them they would return twelve slaps, a kick, and maybe abullet! Anyone who so retaliates is not a true Christian, or lover of Christ,for that is not the spirit of the all-forgiving Jesus.Every time you see the symbol of the Cross it should remind you of what itstands for—that you must bear your crosses with right attitude, even as Jesusdid. When you mean well and still you are misunderstood or mistreated, insteadof being angry you should say, as did Christ: “Father, forgive them for theyknow not what they do.” Why forgive one who wrongs you? Because if you angrilystrike back you misrepresent your own divine soul nature—you are no better thanyour offender. But if you manifest spiritual strength you are blessed, and thepower of your righteous behavior will also help the other person to overcome hismisunderstanding.Those eternal principles of truth and righteousness taught by Jesus we take veryseriously in India—we take them literally, without rationalizing them to suitour purposes. Jesus said: “And everyone that hath forsaken houses, or brethren,or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name’ssake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.”15[part0044.html#footnote-234] That spirit of renunciation for God isall-pervasive in India. Especially in olden days it was the ideal of every manto give at least one part of his lifetime to God alone.God Does Not Like to Be ForgottenComplete renunciation is not necessary for everyone, but if you forget God whilefulfilling your material duties, God will not like it. Give time to Him alone,without work. I always save time in the morning and night for God, and the restof the day I serve Him wholeheartedly. The Lord says in the Gita: “Whateveractions thou dost perform...dedicate them all as offerings to Me. Thus no actionof thine can enchain thee with good or evil karma.”16[part0044.html#footnote-233] You came on this earth for God. It is His world,not yours. You are here to work for Him. Life will very much disappoint anddisillusion you if you labor only for yourself, because eventually you will haveto leave everything; you will be forced to practice renunciation then!The message of Christ is one of compassion and forgiveness, renunciation (inspirit if one cannot do it in actuality), morality, brotherly love and unity andequality, and supreme love for God. Remember Jesus’ admonition: “And why call yeme, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?”17[part0044.html#footnote-232]The authenticity of the life of Christ has been questioned by many agnostics.Some have propounded the theory that Jesus was legendary, his life a merefictitious drama. I know that Christ is real, for I have seen him many times.Jesus was not as fair complexioned as most of you in the West. He had dark skin.And his eyes were not pale blue, as many artists paint them; they were dark. Norwas his hair blond; it also was dark.A Vision of Christ at the Yogoda School in IndiaOne day at my school in Ranchi, I was sitting with the young boys when I sawsomeone coming toward us, from behind the boys, and wondered who it was. Then Isaw it was Jesus; his feet were not touching the ground as he approached. Hecame very close to us and then vanished.A few years later, in Boston, I again saw Jesus. I was meditating and deeplypraying to God because I felt that for three days I had forgotten Him—I had beenso engrossed in fulfilling the responsibilities He had given to me. I told theLord: “I am going to walk out of this work!” The right attitude is to love Godand love His work because of Him. Those who do missionary service, but nevermake the effort to meditate or commune with God, never find Him. Because I feltthat the activities of my ministry had taken me away from God, I prayed, “Lord,I will go away. I will not remain in America and do Your work unless I know Youare with me.” Then a Voice came through the ether like a beam of light: “What doyou want? You cannot go.” Many times in my life God has thus prevented me fromcarrying out my desire to run away from my duties to this cause, to be only withHim. I replied to the Divine Voice: “Let me see, on a sea of gold, Krishna andJesus and their disciples.” Even as I made this inward request, I saw thosedivine ones coming toward me! “It is a hallucination,” I thought. “If the personmeditating with me sees this also, then I shall believe.” Instantly my companionexclaimed aloud: “Oh, I see Christ and Krishna!” Then I rationalized, “This isthought transference.” I was doubting and praying to God to help my unbeliefwhen the Voice said: “When I leave, the room will become filled with thefragrance of the lotus, and whoever comes shall notice it.” As the visionvanished, the whole room became permeated with a marvelous lotus essence. Othersentering the room even hours later noted the aroma. I could doubt no longer.Mahavatar Babaji ordained that I come to America to interpret the teachings ofChrist for the purpose of showing their parallelism with the yoga teachings ofIndia’s Lord Krishna. In the immortal truths expressed by these two avatars liesthe answer of the ages. That is why Babaji, who is in divine communion withChrist, gave me the special dispensation of carrying this message to the West.So long as breath will be in the body, I will try to bring East and Westtogether to fulfill the purpose for which Christ came on earth in an Orientalbody. His soul in the West, his body in the East; bringing soul and bodytogether unites East and West.Truth Is a Universal ExperienceHelp to spread the message of Self-Realization Fellowship. There is nothingvague or mystical about Self-Realization teachings. You can realize these truthsfor yourself. Truth is truth, and it is a universal experience. After I heard myguru, Sri Yukteswarji, teach, I could see the blemishes in the talks of thosewho tried to make me understand something they did not understand themselves. Asalesman should never try to sell something he does not believe in. One shouldteach only those things he has practiced and experienced.Devotees of this path should sincerely study the Self-Realization Lessons andmeditate deeply each night before going to bed. Jesus promised to send the HolyGhost, the Great Comforter.18 [part0044.html#footnote-231] Through the practiceof the Self-Realization techniques of meditation, the faithful student isenabled to realize the fulfillment of that promise. Worshiping Jesus is nottruly meaningful until one can expand his consciousness to receive withinhimself the Christ Consciousness. That is the second coming of Christ. Unlessyou do your part, a thousand Christs come on earth would not be able to saveyou. You have to work for your own salvation. Then Christ can help you.The first two lines of Rudyard Kipling’s poem became famous: “East is East andWest is West, and never the twain shall meet....” But just because I eat curryand you eat apple pie, why should there be division between us? Division isimaginary lines drawn by small minds. It is the result of superiority complexes,and is the cause of wars and pernicious troubles. We must destroy division. Lookto the example of the great Christ who came in the East and stands as a loftyideal before both East and West, telling them, “Here am I in the midst of you;learn from one another, balance your spirituality and material development.”There he stands—a Christ of East and West—linking the two hemispheres with thismessage of unity. Can you not see him?[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0044.html#footnote-248-backlink] The Sankhya philosophy defines truereligion as “those immutable principles that protect man permanently from thethreefold suffering of disease, unhappiness, and ignorance.”2 [part0044.html#footnote-247-backlink] Many parallel references are noted andanalyzed in Autobiography of a Yogi.3 [part0044.html#footnote-246-backlink] “Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem ofJudea in the days of Herod the king, behold there came wise men from the east toJerusalem, saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seenhis star in the east, and are come to worship him” (Matthew 2:1–2).4 [part0044.html#footnote-245-backlink] Matthew 6:22.5 [part0044.html#footnote-244-backlink] Ref.

Blueis also the color of the Christ Consciousness when epitomized in the spiritualeye as a circle of dark blue light surrounding the star mentioned earlier inthis talk.) According to M. V. Sridatta Sarma (“On the Advent of Sri Krishna”),of the various other meanings given to the word “Krishna,” several are found inthe Brahmavaivarta Purana. He states that according to one of these derivations,“Krsna means the Universal Spirit. Krsi denotes a generic term, while na conveysthe idea of the self, thus bringing forth the meaning ‘Omniscient Spirit.’” Inthis we find a parallel to the Christ Consciousness as the Intelligence of Godomnipresent in creation.

The sun shines equally on a piece of charcoal and adiamond, but only the diamond reflects the sun’s light. God’s light also shinesequally on all stages of life, but the reflection is greater from some than fromothers. The divine light is fully reflected by the man of realization.Every human being is essentially a soul, covered with a veil of maya. Throughevolution and self-effort, man makes a little hole in the veil; in time, hemakes the hole bigger and bigger. As the opening enlarges, his consciousnessexpands; the soul becomes more manifest. When the veil is completely torn away,the soul is fully manifest in him. That man has become a master—master ofhimself and of maya.The great ones are not specially manufactured by God. They became mastersthrough their own efforts. They had to work and fight for liberation, just asall the rest of mankind is struggling toward the light of soul freedom.Divine incarnations such as Jesus Christ and Jadava1[part0045.html#footnote-276] Krishna had somewhere, sometime, developed thatspiritual stature which foredestined their birth as avatars.2[part0045.html#footnote-275] Such beings are free from the karmic compulsions ofrebirth; they return to earth only to help liberate mankind.Even though liberated, the divine ones play, at God’s behest, their human rolesin the seeming reality of the earth-life drama. They have their weaknesses,their struggles and temptations, and then, through righteous battle and rightbehavior, they attain victory. In this way they show that all men can be and aremeant to be spiritually victorious over the forces that would keep them fromrealizing their inherent oneness with God.A Christ and a Krishna created perfect by God, without any effort ofself-evolution on their part, and merely pretending to struggle and overcometheir trials on earth, could not be examples for suffering humans to follow. Thefact that the great ones too were once such mortals, but overcame, makes thempillars of strength and inspiration for stumbling mankind. When we know thatdivine avatars, in order to make themselves perfect, once had to go through thesame kinds of human trials and experiences that we do, it gives us hope in ourown struggle.A God-realized master is known by his spiritual deeds. Miracles are not the mostimportant of these. Some of the miracles that Christ performed can be duplicatedin other ways by scientists today. On the spiritual side, Christ himself said:“He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greaterworks than these shall he do.”3 [part0045.html#footnote-274] Miracles such asyou have heard about I have seen demonstrated many times by the masters; butthese are not the criterion of their greatness. The power to perform miraclescomes naturally to those who know God, because they are in tune with His cosmiclaws; but those who become attached to miracles will lose Him. God alone must bethe goal of our hearts. A master’s most important spiritual accomplishment isthe conquering of maya, delusion: the attainment of that realization which makesGod supreme in one’s life—more important than life itself.Christ performed his greatest miracle when he allowed himself to suffer on thecross, saying, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.”4[part0045.html#footnote-273] He could have retaliated with spiritual power andsaved himself. His victory has immortalized him as an example for the ages. Ifhe was able to overcome his mortal consciousness to express divinity, other mencan do the same.The manifestation of God in the life of divine beings is sometimes measured interms of the quantitative and qualitative good they do. But great ones who fullymanifest God are equally one with Him. So it is impossible to make comparisonsbetween the masters (or avatars), and foolish to try, because being one with Godthey are all the same; they are all equal before Him.But to me Krishna and Christ stand supreme. By the greatness of his lovingsacrifice, Christ has influenced the whole world. Krishna manifested a differentaspect of the Infinite Father. In contradistinction to Christ, who was arenunciant, Krishna was a king; and I bow to one who can be a king and remain adivine one at the same time. To be in the world but not of the world is verydifficult, for you live in the midst of temptations and desires and yet mustremain untouched by them.Krishna came on earth much earlier than Christ, about three thousand yearsbefore, some scholars say. The lives of Christ and Krishna have not only a greatspiritual concomitance; there are also parallels in the personal stories thatcome down to us. Both Jesus and Krishna were born of devout, God-loving parents.Krishna’s parents were persecuted by his wicked uncle, King Kansa; King Herod’sthreats tormented the mother and father of Jesus. Jesus has been likened to agood shepherd; Krishna, during his early years in hiding from Kansa, was acowherd. Jesus conquered Satan; Krishna conquered the demon Kaliya.5[part0045.html#footnote-272] Jesus stopped a storm on the sea to save a shipcarrying his disciples; Krishna, to prevent his devotees and their cattle frombeing drowned in a deluge of rain, lifted Mt. Gowardhan over them like anumbrella.Jesus was called “King of the Jews,” though his kingdom was not of this world;Krishna was an earthly king as well as a divine one. Jesus had women disciples,Mary, Martha, and Mary Magdalene, who helped him and played a vital role in hismission; Krishna’s women disciples, Radha and the gopis (milkmaids), similarlyplayed divine roles. Jesus was crucified by being nailed to a cross; Krishna wasmortally wounded by a hunter’s arrow. The destinies of both were prophesied inthe scriptures. These two avatars, both Orientals, are generally recognized inthe West and East respectively as the supreme incarnations of God.Jesus Christ and Bhagavan Krishna gave to the world two of the greatest books ofall times. The words of Lord Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita and of Lord Jesus inthe New Testament of the Bible are sublime manifestations of truth, great modelsof spiritual scripture. These two bibles give essentially the same teaching. Thedeeper Christianity that was preached by Jesus has been lost sight of today.Christ taught devotion and yoga, as did Krishna; and it was my param-paramguru,Mahavatar Babaji, who first spoke of showing the unity of Christ’s teaching andKrishna’s Yoga philosophy.6 [part0045.html#footnote-271] To fulfill this missionis the special dispensation given to me by Babaji.The Universal ConsciousnessI am glad that Christianity was not called “Jesusism,” because Christianity is amuch broader word. There is a difference of meaning between Jesus and Christ.7[part0045.html#footnote-270] Jesus is the name of a little human body in whichthe vast Christ Consciousness was born. Although the Christ Consciousnessmanifested in the body of Jesus, it cannot be limited to one human form. Itwould be a metaphysical error to say that the omnipresent Christ Consciousnessis circumscribed by the body of any one human being.Jadava Krishna is the Christ of the Hindus. These two great avatars, Jadava andJesus, fully manifested the Christ Consciousness, the Kutastha Chaitanya ordivine guiding Intelligence that is in every atom of creation. “But as many asreceived him (the universal Christ Consciousness), to them gave he power tobecome the sons of God.”8 [part0045.html#footnote-269]Jesus said: “Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall notfall on the ground without [the sight of] your Father.”9[part0045.html#footnote-268] God’s consciousness is everywhere. He knowssimultaneously everything that is going on in the world. You are aware ofwhatever is happening in any part of your body, and in the same way God feelseverything that is going on in His body—the cosmos. When you can feel Hisomnipresent consciousness in your fingertips, in your heart and head andwherever there is any vibration of creation; when you can feel yourself in everyspeck of space; when your sympathy and love have spread everywhere and you feeloneness with everything, you are in Christ Consciousness. Both Jesus and Jadavawere one with the omnipresence of Christ Consciousness.If you put some salt water in a bottle and cork it, and then place the bottle inthe ocean, the water in the bottle cannot mix with the water of the ocean.Remove the cork and they become one, being composed of the same ingredients. Sowhen we remove the cork of ignorance from the bottle of our consciousness, asdid Jadava Krishna and Jesus Christ, we become one with the vast UniversalConsciousness.From Christ and Krishna we learn that the purpose of religion is to expand humanconsciousness and unite it with the omnipresent Christ Consciousness. How? Thesocial way is by cultivating divine love for everything that is. To love allimpartially is to know Christ Consciousness. The transcendental way is by directcommunion with the Christ Consciousness through yoga meditation.The body continuously reminds you that you are flesh. Yet every night in sleepGod banishes your consciousness of the flesh to show you that you are not thebody. You are not the wave, but the Ocean behind the wave. You are not thismortal consciousness, but the Immortal Consciousness behind it.Jesus declared: “I and my Father are one.”10 [part0045.html#footnote-267] He whoknows God becomes one with God. The consciousness of such a devotee is not onlyin the body; he feels oneness with the Spirit behind his body and mind. When thewave dances on the sea it thinks it exists as a separate entity. But once itrealizes, “I cannot exist without the ocean,” the wave sees that it is theocean, that the ocean has created a little wave out of itself. Similarly, Godcan manifest Himself as a soul within the form of man, but He cannot be limitedby that form. The Bhagavad Gita says: “The Supreme Spirit, transcendent andexisting in the body, is the detached Beholder, the Consenter, the Sustainer,the Experiencer, the Great Lord, and also the Highest Self.”11[part0045.html#footnote-266] Jesus understood that “The Father has becomemyself.” This truth is also brought out in the Hindu scriptures: “Tat twam asi,”“That thou art.”Concepts of God and Trinity AgreeHinduism as well as Christianity believes in one God. A few misunderstandingWesterners who have visited India have brought back stories that prejudiceothers against Hindu religious practices. I could similarly go back to India andsay that I found America to be a place of murderers, racketeers, and drunkards;but I realize that such persons do not constitute the whole of America. Thereare defects in India as there are defects in America and everywhere else. SomeIndian teachers instruct their followers to concentrate on an image representinga particular aspect of the Infinite Spirit. The visible image helps devotees toincrease their concentration and devotion in prayer to the unseen Spirit.Uninformed Westerners conclude that Indians as a whole worship idols. But weworship only Brahman, Spirit. The concept of one God is the same in Hinduism asin Christianity.The concept of the Trinity is also exactly the same in the Hindu and Christianscriptures. The Trinity is not a negation of the one God; it illustrates ametaphysical truth, that the One became Three when God made this creation.In the beginning—when there was no creation—there was Spirit. But Spirit wantedto create, and by His wishful thought He projected a great sphere of light, orcosmic energy, which became the universe. That cosmic energy is the Holy Ghost.“Ghost” means something invisible and intelligent. “Holy Ghost” refers to thespiritual vibration or energy of creation in which the intelligence of God isimmanent as Christ Consciousness, “the only begotten Son,”12[part0045.html#footnote-265] God’s pure reflection in creation. This ChristIntelligence holds the universe in balance. God the Father is the Intelligencebeyond creation; the Son or Christ Consciousness is His Intelligence increation; and the Holy Ghost is the intelligent vibration of creation itself.Long before Christ spoke of it, the Trinity was described in the Hinduscriptures: “Aum, Tat, Sat”—Cosmic Vibration, Christ Intelligence, and God theFather.The Bible tells us of Jesus Christ’s promise that when he was gone from thisworld he would send the Comforter,13 [part0045.html#footnote-264] the HolyGhost. Every vibration emanates a sound. The Holy Ghost is the CosmicIntelligent Vibration, whose sound is the Aum or Amen heard in deep yogameditation. Saint John spoke of it when he said: “I was in the Spirit on theLord’s day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet.”14[part0045.html#footnote-263] That sound is the Holy Ghost. In its vibration isour comfort.We are living in a new age in which God’s voice of cosmic vibration, of Aum andAmen, can be heard from the two ends of the two hemispheres in the scriptures ofKrishna and Christ. It was in the land of India that Krishna spoke of the Aumsound 15 [part0045.html#footnote-262] and it was another Oriental Christ whospoke of this same vibration, calling it Amen or Holy Ghost, as the means ofcommuning with God.By attuning your consciousness within in meditation, you can hear and communewith the Aum or Amen vibration in which you meet the great Comforter. Incommunion with the holy Comforter you realize the immanent Christ Consciousness.In deeper communion with the Christ Consciousness you realize you are one withGod. As soon as you know the Holy Ghost you know Christ Consciousness, and whenyou know Christ Consciousness you know that you and your Father, CosmicConsciousness, are one. The divine Christ Consciousness hidden in every atom ofcreation is the same as the Cosmic Consciousness of the Father beyond creation.First you must know how to commune with the Trinity. Through such communion, youbecome one with Spirit; then there is no longer a Trinity: Father, Son, and HolyGhost are seen to be the one Spirit.The Pitfalls of Body ConsciousnessConsider the limitations of this physical body. Looking outward you see disease,suffering, pain, and heartaches; but on the other, inner side of this body, inthe subtle centers of spiritual consciousness, is the Comforter. When your mindfollows the stream of ordinary outward consciousness you will know Hades; butwhen by meditating on Aum your mind follows the stream of the innerconsciousness, you will find the great Heaven that exists behind this body. Thatis why Jesus said, “Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what yeshall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life morethan meat, and the body more than raiment?”16 [part0045.html#footnote-261] Assoon as you become concentrated on the limited physical body you will fall intothe pit of misery. It is popular in these times to seek prosperity, but you maybecome ill and unable to enjoy your abundance. Therefore Jesus warned that weshould seek the kingdom of God first. Your consciousness must be with God. Thisis man’s highest duty. “For all these things do the nations of the world seekafter; and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things. But ratherseek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you.”17[part0045.html#footnote-260] Health or no health, power or no power, seek Godfirst. When you seek with that determination, “all things shall be added untoyou”—not before.Christ went even further: “There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, orsisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, andthe gospel’s, but he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, andbrethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions;and in the world to come eternal life.”18 [part0045.html#footnote-259] In thesewords Christ teaches physical renunciation as the highest way of attaining God.Isn’t it foolish not to renounce a few material things in order to realize thekingdom of heaven? But seldom do even devout Christians follow what Christ saidhere; not many are able to follow this path. Yet renunciation is notself-punishment; it is the investment of a few temporal trinkets in order togain the eternal treasure—God. Worldly persons have left God for perishableacquisitions, but I have left perishable things for God.The Gita also advises renunciation. Krishna says: “Forsaking all other dharmas(duties), remember Me alone; I will free thee from all sins (accruing fromnonperformance of those lesser duties).”19 [part0045.html#footnote-258] Theshame and trouble and misery that will arise from forsaking worldly duties Godwill forgive you. But the Gita says more: “The sages call that man wise whosepursuits are all without selfish plan or longings for results, and whoseactivities are purified (cauterized of karmic outgrowths) by the fire of wisdom.Relinquishing attachment to the fruits of work, always contented, independent(of material rewards), the wise do not perform any (binding) action even in themidst of activities.”20 [part0045.html#footnote-257] Therein Krishna declaresthat it is not necessary to forsake all things outwardly to find God, ifeverything you do is without selfish motive, and done only to please Him. Toforget God for worldly duties is to show colossal ingratitude, for we cannot doour duty to our family and others without the power borrowed from Him.In India hundreds go away into the forest just to think of God alone. That isthe way that Christ taught when he called to his disciples, “Follow me.”21[part0045.html#footnote-256] They left their work and their homes and forsookall, even their lives, for God.Significance of Krishna’s Life for Modern ManLord Krishna says in the Gita that what man really needs to do to find thekingdom of heaven is to renounce the fruits of action. God has sent man intothis life so circumstanced with hunger and desires that he must work. Withoutwork human civilization would be a jungle of disease, famine, and confusion. Ifall the people in the world were to leave their material civilizations and livein the forests, the forests would then have to be transformed into cities, elsethe inhabitants would die because of lack of sanitation. On the other hand,material civilization is full of imperfections and misery. What possible remedycan be advocated?Krishna’s life demonstrates his philosophy that it is not necessary to flee theresponsibilities of material life. The problem can be solved by bringing Godhere where He has placed us. No matter what our environment may be, into themind where God-communion reigns, Heaven must come.“A heaven without Thee, O God, I want not! I love to work in the factory if Ican but hear Thy voice in the noisy wheels of the machinery. A material lifewithout Thee, my Lord, is a source of physical misery, disease, crime,ignorance, and unhappiness.”22 [part0045.html#footnote-255]To avoid the pitfalls of the two extremes, renunciation of the world, ordrowning in material life, man should so train his mind by constant meditationthat he can perform the necessary dutiful actions of his daily life and stillmaintain the consciousness of God within. All men and women should remember thattheir worldly life can be freed from endless physical and mental ills if theyadd deep meditation to their daily routine of living. A balanced life ofmeditation and activity, without attachment to the fruits of action, is theexample set by Krishna’s life.The message of Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita stands as the doctrine best suitedto our modern busy life of many worries. To work without the peace of God ishades. To work with God’s happiness ever bubbling in the soul is to carry aportable paradise within you wherever you go. To be constantly worried even inpleasant surroundings is to live in hades; to live in the inner, boundlesssoul-peace, even though housed in a rickety shack, is real paradise. Whether ina palace or under a tree, we must carry with us always this inner heaven.The yogi enjoys everything with the consciousness of God. But at the same timehe can say: “If I don’t see the face of food, I shall never miss it.” Theconditions of the world should not bother you. Be not attached to anything.Jesus fasted for forty days and kept his mind always on God.If you are in the world and have no attachment to it, you are a real yogi. Toremain in the candy store and not touch the candy is true renunciation. However,milk will not float on water unless you make butter of it. The only way to findhappiness and emancipation is to seek God and live by His laws. Jesus said: “Ifthy hand offend thee, cut it off.”23 [part0045.html#footnote-254] That kind ofdetermination is needed. You must realize in your heart and soul this truth:“Lord, You alone are mine. I am here just to please You.”Renounce not only outwardly but mentally too. Jesus did not mean that man shouldnot eat or put on clothes; he himself ate food and wore clothing. He did meanthat one should be mentally nonattached to dress and food. He was teaching thatrenunciation must be accomplished mentally as well as externally. “Take nothought...for your body”24 [part0045.html#footnote-253] means “Don’t worry toomuch about food and clothing and the demands of the body.” It is more importantto be clean inside than outside. If you can be pure within and also cleanwithout, that is even better.Moral Doctrines Universal in the ScripturesWe find the main moral doctrines of religion in both the Bible and the Hinduscriptures. The message of the Gita includes the precepts of the TenCommandments of Christianity, and also the reason why it is wrong to break them.The Gita wisely warns: “He who ignores the scriptural commands and who followshis own foolish desires does not find happiness or perfection or the InfiniteGoal.”25 [part0045.html#footnote-252] You can be moral without being religious,but the principles of morality are a necessary beginning in the practice ofreligion; for true religion is deeper than morality—it is contact with God. Youshould not concentrate on your faults, nor think of yourself as a sinner. Affirmthat you are a child of God, and dwell on what Jesus said: “I and my Father areone.”Reincarnation in the Gita and the BibleReincarnation, so beautifully expounded by Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita, is oneof the most helpful and inspiring spiritual doctrines; without it we cannotunderstand the justice of God. Why would a baby be born crippled? Why would Godsend to a family two babies who are strong and whole, and one who is lame? If weare all made in God’s image, where is the justice of this? Only reincarnationcan explain it. The crippled baby is a soul that in some past life transgressedGod’s laws and, as a result, lost the use of his legs. As it is the mind thatmolds the body, and this soul had lost the consciousness of having healthy legs,it was unable to create a perfect pair of limbs when it came back again in thislife. And so we must come, and come again, until we regain our lost perfection.He who becomes perfect shall not have to return to earth anymore.Those who have overcome desire shall be one with God. Jesus spoke of this whenhe said: “Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, andhe shall go no more out.”26 [part0045.html#footnote-251] The Gita similarlypromises: “O Arjuna! this is the ‘established in Brahman’ state. Anyone enteringthis state is never (again) deluded. Even at the very moment of transition (fromthe physical to the astral), if one becomes anchored therein, he attains thefinal, irrevocable, state of Spirit-communion.”27 [part0045.html#footnote-250]When you overcome physical desires, you shall go no more out of God. Desirebrings you back to this earth. We have been prodigal children, and unless weforsake desires we cannot go back to God. If suddenly we have to leave thisearth with desires still in our hearts, we must come here again until we workthem out. It is necessary to regain self-perfection before we can return to God.When the storm is on, the wave rises out of the ocean, but as soon as the oceanis calm again, the wave can sink back into the sea. So it is with us. As soon asthis storm of material desires is over we can melt again into the ocean of God.Early Christianity taught reincarnation. Jesus had revealed his knowledge ofthis truth when he said: “Elias is come already, and they knew him not....Thenthe disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.”28[part0045.html#footnote-249] When he said, “Elias is come already,” he meantthat the soul of Elias had reincarnated in the body of John the Baptist.Christ Born an Oriental to Unite East and WestGod made Jesus Christ an Oriental in order to bring East and West together.Christ came to awaken the divine consciousness of brotherhood in the East andWest. It is true also that Christ lived in India during the eighteenunaccounted-for years of his life, studying with India’s great masters. Thatdoesn’t take away from his divinity and uniqueness; it shows the unity andbrotherhood of all great saints and avatars.The great ones come on earth to show that the Christ Consciousness they haveattained is what all who live here must seek. You must expand your consciousnessand banish your suffering. Eating food doesn’t make physical pain go away.Acquiring possessions doesn’t stop mental suffering. Reading spiritual booksdoesn’t satisfy the soul. The masters of India say that the purpose of religionis not to create certain doctrines to be followed blindly, but to show mankindthe perennial method of finding everlasting happiness. As the businessman triesto alleviate the suffering of others by supplying some need; as every man is anagent of God for doing some good on earth, so Christ, Krishna, Buddha—all thegreat ones—came on earth to bestow on mankind the highest good: knowledge of thepath to Eternal Bliss, and the example of their sublime lives to inspire us tofollow it.Someday you will have to leave the body. No matter how powerful you are, thebody will eventually have to be buried beneath the sod. There is no time to bewasted. The Yoga methods taught by my beloved Christ and my beloved Krishna dodestroy ignorance and suffering, by enabling man to attain his ownSelf-realization and union with God. In the name of the Originator of Christiansand Hindus, let us break down the walls of suffering and ignorance, and worshipGod truly. Too often in His name the demons of avarice and prejudice have dancedin God’s temples. We must restore to His altars the Lord of peace and joy. Letus behave on earth not as Americans or Indians with conflicting customs andbeliefs, but as children of one Father. “Christian” and “Hindu” are only names.Let us live as a great divine family in a United World of Oneness, knowingwithin and without the harmony and bliss of Spirit.* * *A Vision of Christ and KrishnaAn experience recounted byParamahansa Yogananda in Whispers from EternityI beheld a great blue valley encircled by mountains that shimmered jewel-like.Around opalescent peaks vagrant mists sparkled. A river of silence flowed by,diamond-bright. And there I saw, coming out of the depths of the mountains,Jesus and Krishna walking hand in hand: the Christ who prayed by the riverJordan and the Christna who played a flute by the river Yamuna.They baptized me in the radiant waters; my soul melted in fathomless depths.Everything began to emit astral flames. My body and the forms of Christ andKrishna, the iridescent hills, the glowing stream, and the far empyrean becamedancing lights, while atoms of fire flew. Finally nothing remained but mellowluminosity, in which all creation trembled.O Spirit! in my heart I bow again and again to Thee: Eternal Light in Whom allforms commingle.[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0045.html#footnote-276-backlink] One of the several names of Krishna.(See Bhagavan Krishna [part0074.html#_idTextAnchor090] in glossary.)2 [part0045.html#footnote-275-backlink] This Sanskrit word means “descent”; itsroots are ava, “down,” and tri, “to pass.” In the Hindu scriptures, avatarasignifies the descent of Divinity into flesh.3 [part0045.html#footnote-274-backlink] John 14:12.4 [part0045.html#footnote-273-backlink] Luke 23:34.5 [part0045.html#footnote-272-backlink] Satan and Kaliya represent evil, orignorance of God.6 [part0045.html#footnote-271-backlink] Mahavatar Babaji had requested my guru,Swami Sri Yukteswar, to write a book showing that there is no real discrepancybetween the scriptures of East and West.

Banishselfishness—individual, industrial, political, national—and you will have nomore wars.When materiality predominates in man’s consciousness, there is an emission ofsubtle negative rays; their cumulative power disturbs the electrical balance ofnature, and that is when earthquakes, floods, and other disasters happen. God isnot responsible for them! Man’s thoughts have to be controlled before nature canbe controlled.2 [part0046.html#footnote-285]Rama, an avatar who was one of India’s great Hindu emperors, reigned over thekingdom of Ayodhya, whose inhabitants all lived righteously. It is said thatduring the golden era of Rama’s rule no accidents or premature deaths or naturaldisasters disturbed Ayodhya’s perfect harmony. There will be more harmony andhealth in every home as the individual members of the family live more rightly.When family members selfishly take away from one another, the house naturallywill be filled with disharmony. So also with the nations; only when mankindlives rightly will the kingdom of God come on earth. But time is short. You arehere today, and tomorrow you are gone. As a human being, it is your highestprivilege to seek God. You should use the freedom He has given you in this lifeto prove by experiment the eternal spiritual truths.Sin is that which causes you suffering. Virtue is that which makes you lastinglyhappy. If there is no spiritual harmony in your mind, even a new house and a newcar cannot make you happy; you will have your hades with you just the same.Real happiness can stand the challenge of all outer experiences. When you canbear the crucifixions of others’ wrongs against you and still return love andforgiveness; and when you can keep that divine inner peace intact despite allpainful thrusts of outer circumstance, then you shall know this happiness.“He who ignores the scriptural commands and who follows his own foolish desiresdoes not find happiness or perfection or the Infinite Goal. Therefore, take thescriptures as your guide in determining what should be done and what should beavoided. With intuitive understanding of the injunctions declared in holy writ,be pleased to perform thy duties here.”3 [part0046.html#footnote-284] Those whoare inwardly content are living rightly. Happiness comes only by doing right. Behappy here and you will also be happy in the beyond. Death is not an escape. Youmust be good now if you want heaven in the future. According to the law of causeand effect, you are after death exactly what you were before. So “make hay” bygathering wisdom while the sun of opportunity shines.The Ten Eternal Rules of HappinessThe Ten Commandments4 [part0046.html#footnote-283] might have been more aptlynamed the Ten Eternal Rules of Happiness. The word “commandment” is anunfortunate choice, because few persons like to be commanded. As soon as youtell a child not to do a thing, he at once wants to do it.These Ten Commandments are being broken every day, everywhere. Unless theirspiritual meaning is understood, people will always rebel against them. The TenCommandments are eternal rules of conduct that have been set forth in all thegreat world religions. However, the scriptures for the most part do not explainthe psychology and utility of these commandments. People accept them in churchbut do not act upon them outside of church, rationalizing that these preceptsare impractical. Yet the breaking of the Ten Commandments is the primary sourceof all the misery in the world.What is the utility of the commandments? In the Bhagavad Gita we are told toforsake all else and remember God alone. “Absorb thy mind in Me, become Mydevotee; resign all things to Me; bow down to Me. Thou art dear to Me, so intruth do I promise thee: thou shalt attain Me.”5 [part0046.html#footnote-282]This corresponds to the first of the Ten Commandments given to Moses:“Thou shalt have no other gods before me.” God-realization should be the goal ofliving. Material duties cannot be performed without power borrowed from God. Toperform one’s ordinary duties, and forget Him, is the highest sin. Sin meansignorance, acting against one’s highest good. How many times have you felt aburning sorrow in your heart? Why? Because you didn’t act rightly; because Godwas not first in your heart. The Gita says: “Forsaking all other dharmas(duties), remember Me alone; I will free thee from all sins (accruing fromnonperformance of those lesser duties).”6 [part0046.html#footnote-281] Thereshould be no other god in your life who means more to you than God. Even thoughJesus was one with the Father, he said: “I do not know all the things that myFather knows.”7 [part0046.html#footnote-280]As soon as man begins to worship possessions, name, fame—anything less thanGod—he finds unhappiness. “Those who worship lesser gods, O Arjuna, they go untothem; My devotee comes unto Me.”8 [part0046.html#footnote-279] Only God canfulfill man’s dreams of lasting happiness. No diversion should be allowed toreplace worship of the Supreme Lord. If you study the Hindu scriptures you willsee how they correspond with the Ten Commandments of the Bible.“Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image.” Symbol worship is all rightfor a few, but it has more bad than good results. To worship the cross of Christand forget what the cross stands for is to worship a “graven image,” because youhave lost sight of its significance. When a great spiritual teacher passes on,his image, or some symbol of his life, is usually kept and venerated, and thisis all right provided you remember and emulate his qualities. But if you worshipan image without conscious regard for what it represents, then you haveforgotten the Infinite. To have a picture or a statue of Jesus is acceptable ifit helps you to dwell on his divine qualities. Then you are not worshiping agraven image, but the ideal the image represents to you. Whatever worship ritualyou perform with the consciousness of Spirit is pleasing to the Lord. But inMoses’ time many worshipers had forgotten God; they were venerating mereobjects, even sacrificing goats to them.In India it is customary to make a picture or statue of a saint, or perhaps tofashion an image symbolic of a specific manifestation or quality of the Divine,and place it in a temple. The people offer flowers to God or to the spirit ofthe saint represented by the picture or statue, and meditate on the divinequalities it symbolizes. Such worship is acceptable in God’s eyes.9[part0046.html#footnote-278] True devotees do not allow their consciousness todwell on the object, but concentrate with deepest love and attention on theSpirit behind it. A great saint of India used to go into samadhi (ecstaticcommunion with God) whenever he offered his devotion before the image of theDivine Mother in the temple where he worshiped. “I was placing flowers at thefeet of a stone symbol,” he said, “when suddenly I beheld that, untouched by mybody, I was one with the Sustainer of the universe. I began placing flowers onmy own head.”If you can do so, it is much better to concentrate inwardly on God than to focusyour attention first on an external intermediary symbol, and then transfer thatconcentration to the Spirit. God is infinite. How could an image encase Him?This is the reason behind the second commandment. We should not worship an imageas God, because He is infinite.Being infinite, God cannot be limited to any form, human or stone; yet He ismanifest in all forms. One can rightly say that God manifests in every man aswell as in great saints, for He is present in all. The sun shines equally, also,on a piece of charcoal and a diamond. But the diamond receives and reflects thesun’s light, whereas the charcoal does not. Similarly, all people are exposed tothe light of God, but not all receive and reflect that light. To do so they mustpurify themselves by meditation and by following the Ten Commandments.“Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.” When you say thename of God, you must be inwardly aware of what you are saying. Were it possibleto look into others’ minds when they are praying, you would see that a greatmany are thinking about almost anything but the Lord. They are taking the nameof God in vain. When we pray we should try our utmost to concentrate our wholeattention on God, instead of saying “God, God, God” and letting our minds dwellon something else. An aunt of mine had the habit of saying her prayers on beads.She could almost always be seen busily fingering her beads. But she approachedme one day and confessed that although she had been doing this for forty years,God had never answered her prayers. No wonder! Her “prayers” were hardly morethan a nervous physical habit.Don’t think of anything but the Spirit when you are praying. Try your utmost tobe sincere. The use of beads in prayer, and japa, repetition of the name of God,are good when practiced with devotion and concentration. But these all too oftenbecome mechanical; they are lower forms of worship. But to whisper “God” in yourheart on beads of love—that is true worship. It is insulting to God also if yousing hymns or chant to Him with an absent mind. The Bhagavad Gita similarlystresses the importance of a concentrated mind while worshiping God. When youpray, your heart and your mind should be filled with the love of God. “Heattains the Supreme Effulgent Lord, O Arjuna! whose mind, stabilized by Yoga, isimmovably fixed on the thought of Him.”10 [part0046.html#footnote-277]“Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.” Out of a week of seven days, howfew people devote even one to God! To keep apart one day for Him is in the bestinterests of your own welfare. Sunday is the sun’s day—the bright day of wisdom.Many never use it to think of God, though to do so is the highest wisdom. If onthat day, you could just be alone and quiet for a little time, enjoying thatstillness, you would see how much better you feel. Observe the sabbath in thisway; it will be a salve to the lacerations of the preceding six days. Everyoneneeds one day a week in the spiritual hospital to heal his mental wounds.Don’t observe the sabbath as a forced duty; enjoy it. When it becomes for you aday of peace and joy and contentment, you will look forward to it. Seclusion isthe price of greatness. You may be surprised at what seclusion with God will dofor your mind, body, and soul. In the early morning, and before retiring, youshould immerse yourself in His peace.India’s sages counsel not only a regular day for seclusion, but stress the needfor quiet meditation during four specific periods every day. In the earlymorning, before you get up or see anyone, remain calm, feeling peace. At noon,be quiet for a while before taking lunch; and before your evening meal, haveanother time for peace. Before going to bed, go into that silence again. Thosewho faithfully observe silence in seclusion during these four times of the daycannot but feel in tune with God. Whoever cannot manage four times a day shouldobserve each morning and evening a period devoted to God. By doing this you willhave a different, happier life.If you continually write out checks without depositing anything in your bankaccount, you will run out of money. So it is with your life. Without regulardeposits of peace in your life account, you will run out of strength, calmness,and happiness. You will finally become bankrupt—emotionally, mentally,physically, and spiritually. But daily communion with God will continuallyreplenish your inner bankroll.Four times a day sit quietly in meditation and think with all the love andlonging of your heart: “I am with the Infinite now. ‘Father, reveal Thyself,reveal Thyself.’” Strive to feel the peace of His presence. Bathe your mind andbody in that peace, and you will be much more successful in life. The calm mandoesn’t make mistakes. When thousands of others are failing, he succeeds. Youmust be calm to be successful. Those who do not observe the sabbath by feelingthis divine peace develop great moodiness. They become nervous automatons.Through the portals of silence the healing sun of wisdom and peace will shineupon you.The sabbath should be a day of rest and cultivation of divine peace. However,activity that expresses wisdom and peace is also appropriate on the sabbath.“Honor thy father and thy mother.” The human father and mother should be honoredas the representatives of God, the supreme Parent, who has empowered them withHis gift to create man. The mother is God’s unconditional love incarnate,because a true mother forgives when no one else does. The father is amanifestation of the Heavenly Father’s wisdom and protection of His children.One should not love father and mother apart from God, but as representations ofHis protecting love and wisdom. The Supreme Spirit becomes the father and motherto help each child. Therefore honor Him in your parents.“Thou shalt not kill.” The meaning is that one should not kill for killing’ssake; for then you become a murderer. One should not take another’s life in amoment of violent emotion. But if your country is attacked and goes to war, youshould fight to protect those whom God has given to you. You have a righteousobligation to defend your family and your country.“Thou shalt not commit adultery.” The ideal of sexual union should be thecreation of children made in the image of God, and the expression of the purelove of the soul that is felt between marriage partners who behold only God ineach other. Those who live solely on the physical plane, never thinking of loveor the high purpose for which the sex sense was intended, are, in the spirit ofthis commandment, committing adultery. One is then no better than the animal,who has his sex and goes his way.Except for the purpose of procreation, and the expression of mutual true love inthe holy state of matrimony, the creative urge is intended by God to betransmuted into energy and divine realization. Insofar as you can absorb thesexual power, you can develop great mental powers to write, paint, or expressyourself creatively in a thousand other ways. As you ultimately control andspiritualize the creative energy, you will feel great peace and love and blissin God. Saints who have thus spiritualized the sexual energy are very powerful,able to demonstrate wonderful achievements in the world and in the interiorsearch for Truth.Thus the highest use of sex is the sublimation of its power in order to manifestspiritual thoughts and ideals and wisdom. It is detrimental to your mental andphysical well-being if you concentrate on sex apart from the expression ofmarital love or the procreative purpose of married life. One should not dwell onsex thoughts or act promiscuously on sex thoughts. When you can exercise thisrestraint you can develop the right attitude toward sex and its wholesome divinepurpose.The universe and man were immaculately created by God’s will. In the beginning,man also was empowered to create immaculately by will, as God did. Man lost thispower when he was tempted to concentrate on sexual rather than spiritualexpression of the divine creative power. To be enslaved by sex is to losehealth, self-control, and peace of mind—everything that man needs to be happy.“Thou shalt not steal.” If all the people in a community of 1,000 steal from oneanother, each will have 999 enemies. Therefore one should not unfairly take fromothers their property or love or peace or any other possession. If you feel nodesire to take what does not belong to you, that which you need or wish for willcome to you. Stealing begins in the mind, when you begin to covet what othershave. The seeds of desire must be removed from the mind. Spiritual unselfishnessis the way; then one automatically attracts abundance.Unless material selfishness is abandoned, there can be no happiness in theworld. Happiness will come only by spiritual cooperation, when all men begin tofeel for others’ necessities as for their own, and to work for others asearnestly as for self.“Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.” To harm anyone throughdistortion of truth is another way of disrupting social happiness. If you wantto be treated well, you should treat others well. It is important to speak thetruth at all times.To be always truthful one must understand the difference between fact and truth.Your truthfully pointing out that a man is lame only hurts; it does no good.Therefore one should not speak unpleasant facts unnecessarily. To tell a truththat would betray another person, and to no worthy purpose, is also wrong. Oneshould not speak untruth to avoid speaking truth, but rather remain silent.Never carelessly or maliciously reveal information that could embarrass and hurtothers.“Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’swife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbor’s.” Covetousness is the source of discontent. Learnto differentiate between “necessary necessities” and “unnecessary necessities.”The more you covet what others have, the more unhappy you will be. You willspend your life in misery and never find contentment. Seek spiritual richeswithin.What you are is much greater than anything or anyone else you have ever yearnedfor. God is manifest in you in a way that He is not manifest in any other humanbeing. Your face is unlike anyone else’s, your soul is unlike anyone else’s, youare sufficient unto yourself; for within your soul lies the greatest treasure ofall—God.[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0046.html#footnote-286-backlink] A reference to local floods afterunusually heavy rains.2 [part0046.html#footnote-285-backlink] “Man’s vaunted ‘conquest of nature’ isthe expression of a power complex—vain humbug.

To study character in a negative way, however, isnot right, and has a devastating effect. Everyone shuns a “character detective,”who exposes others’ faults. Many people who enjoy criticizing cannot themselvesstand criticism, and may even have the same flaws they so righteously deplore inanother.Character study is important primarily in this respect: one needs constantly totake note of virtues in others and to implant those good traits in himself. Istudy character when I choose people with whom to work. But I have an entirelydifferent standpoint for choosing. Sometimes I let a person that I know is “bad”be with me, in the hope that he will change. If he responds to my spiritualthought for his welfare he becomes better; and if he doesn’t, well, I take thatchance. I am like a medical doctor who risks exposure to a disease in order tohelp a patient. All doctors have to take that chance because their desire is toserve. So it is with a spiritual doctor; he undertakes to judge others and showthem their defects in order to help them improve.Jesus said: “Judge not, that ye be not judged.”1 [part0047.html#footnote-288] Hecondemned that criticism of others which is done solely out of desire to hurt.Such behavior is unkind and spoils friendship. Criticism has no use whatsoeverunless it is given with sincere love, and only when wanted. It should be offeredwith a loving desire to help the other person. Those who have learnedself-control have the right to help others. From that point of view characterstudy is worthwhile.Physical Appearance an Index of CharacterOne type of character study is based on physiognomy. It is said that the salientcharacteristics of man are revealed in his body—a very sweeping statement. Notall one’s physiological characteristics do tell the real tale of the inner life.Aristotle studied physiognomy as a guide to character. Hindu teachers go deeper.They say that the main thoughts of all one’s incarnations are reflected in theeyes. Though the eyes reveal the whole story of the soul, not only of this lifebut of past lives, still it requires a master’s mind to analyze the revelationof your past lives reflected in this life.Once in a while you are walking along and suddenly notice something in the eyesof a passerby, and you think, “I don’t like him,” or as the case may be, “I likehim.” Eyes tell the whole story. Fear, anger, jealousy, greed, generosity, love,courage, spirituality—all these qualities, good and bad, cause correspondingreflections in the eyes. Detectives can control their facial muscles so as notto betray by their expressions what they are thinking, but they cannot hide thesuspicion in their eyes. A yogi has calm eyes because he is thinking of thetranquil Spirit.Facial and bodily features have been studied, even the bumps on the head havebeen analyzed; but physical appearance does not always tell the story, anddifferent cultures draw different conclusions from their observations. Some saythat fat people are luxury-loving and don’t like to work, and that thin peopleare more spiritual. Yet in India, fatness in a spiritual person is viewedfavorably. Caesar was wary of Cassius’ “lean and hungry” appearance, in which hesaw a threat to his power. Some writers have theorized that those who are thinthink too much, hence flesh doesn’t build up on them. A study of history showsthat both lean and stout people have been good rulers.If you are persistently fat now, you were fat many times before; or if in thislife you are chronically thin, you have been thin for several incarnations. Youhave inherited the tendency from the past; and no matter what you eat, thatthought-pattern tends to manifest itself.Physiognomy as a revealer of character is true if one takes into account thefact that all the thoughts that have passed through a particular mind duringmany incarnations show in the body. But it takes the intuitive power of a masterto “read” one’s physiognomy completely and correctly.For example, Socrates was very ugly. He met a great astrologer who said,“Socrates, you are the most evil and wicked person I know.” Socrates’ studentswere very angry at the astrologer, but their teacher replied: “You are right. Ihave been all that in the past. But though I have overcome it by wisdom now,still the things I did then are registered in this body, making it appear ugly.”No two faces are the same. Each is different because of characteristics thathave manifested themselves in this life and in past lives. So it is not a matterof simply judging people as bad or good because their present looks arerepellent or pleasing. St. Francis was not physically attractive, whereas hisdisciple Brother Masseus was a handsome man. But Masseus did not possess asgreat a spiritual beauty as St. Francis.Emotions as a Clue to CharacterThere is another branch of investigation related to physiognomy; that ofpathognomy, the study of man’s feelings and emotions through the outward signsof his facial expressions and bodily movements, and through study of hisemotional reactions to various incidents in his life. Feelings and habitsindicate one’s characteristics; but some people have cultivated the ability tohide their true feelings because they don’t want to expose themselves to others.Two husbands heard the news that their wives had drowned. One was showing greatgrief and the other was not saying anything; but the one who showed sorrowoutwardly felt less love for his wife than did the husband who didn’t reveal byhis facial expression any pain at all. So pathognomy, finding out the truefeelings and reactions of people, is a very deep study.You can analyze people more surely according to their feelings than according totheir physical appearance. I combine the two methods for the most accurateanalysis. All those who come to me for training I place in certain situations tosee how their minds and feelings will react. If they respond adversely I try tocorrect them; but I don’t do this unless the person has asked to be corrected,and has given me the authority and permission to guide him.Some people are emotionally stirred at the slightest thing. Musicians in thiscountry are as a rule very emotional, and most of your music is emotional,because it is written around the theme of human love. In India music centersaround the thought of God. That is why it tends to quiet the storms of emotionand to bring out deep spiritual calmness. Not all Western musicians areemotional, of course; nor are all Indian musicians spiritual, though for themost part they are. The Sanskrit word for musician is bhagavathar, “he who singsthe praises of God.”In dealing with emotional people you can seldom bank on their stability. Todaythey are enthusiastic about you and tomorrow they leave you. I have seen suchpersons come to the ashram, and within a few days they would make me feel theywere going to be as firmly loyal as the disciple John. Next month I would findthey had gone. If anything hurts me, it is when an avowal of friendship iswithdrawn by a breach of that trust. When I give my friendship to anyone, Inever take it back.Evenmindedness, a Key to DevelopmentOne can easily tell the difference between the motor type and the thoughtfultype of man: the former always wants to work and the latter wants to thinkthings through. Both types are needed. Motor types like to act at once. Theyshould be taught to direct their energies into spiritually rewarding activities.In order to help each type to create a harmonious balance, I advise motor typesto meditate and think more, and thoughtful types to meditate and work more.People addicted to bad habits—overeating, smoking, drinking—have to be carefullyhandled. Any obstruction of desire causes anger. If you take food way from agreedy man he will be wrathful. It is useless to try to help such sense slavesuntil they themselves indicate a real desire to improve.Swami Shankara said that evenminded people will know God. The Master of theuniverse sits on the altar of evenmindedness. By evenmindedness man enjoys theperfect equilibrium of peace.One of the three basic qualities predominates in every man, according to Hinduphilosophy.2 [part0047.html#footnote-287] Sattva is the quality of those whohave spiritual tendencies. They eat properly, cultivate good habits, and aredevoted to the Lord. The rajas quality is manifested in those who are active;such persons keep busy with work until they die. Those in whom the tamas qualityis uppermost fill their lives with quarreling, anger, jealousy, sensuality, andlaziness.Any habit that holds you from spiritual attainment should be overcome. You mustbe the master of your thoughts and actions. It is better to be the activerajasic type and to have your habits under control than to be the tamasic type;but the sattvic type in whom goodness manifests itself is ideal. Those who wantto improve themselves should mix more with sattvic types.Very few people know in what lies their own good. By this one criterion you canjudge anyone. Ninety-nine percent of all people fail under this test. Tell aperson, for his own good, to do a particular thing, and he will do exactly theopposite. Why? Because he can’t help himself; his materialistic habits are toostrong. Very often people won’t do what you suggest, even though they know it isgood for them, just to prove that you can’t influence them. Those who reallywant to improve should mix more with those who are calm and self-controlled. Tryto mix with people who are normal, and better still, with people who aresupernormal. The weak should seek out the strong and the strong should seek outthose who are even stronger. A wrestler will never increase his strength unlesshe works out with a stronger man.Animal Characteristics in ManAfter judging the mental qualities of sattva, rajas, and tamas in others, youcan analyze their physical behavior. Some say that women are “catty.” But mencan be just as catty. The cat eats the tame canary and then sits as calmly asany yogi in order to feign innocence of his unwelcome act. Some people enjoybeing destructive to others’ peace and happiness. Their whole purpose is todisturb and upset; like predatory wolves, they go about in society and seek outfights.Certain types of people have been compared to the jay—chattering all the time.It is said that man was created first, and that the god Twashtri then took thegentleness of the moon, the softness of the down from the swan’s breast, thebeauty of the flowers, and the chatter of the jay, and, combining these things,made woman. And man was so happy. But after a while he went to Twashtri andsaid, “She is a beautiful creature. I really appreciate her. But she talkswithout rest and she has become the bane of my life. Take her back.” Then aftertwo months the man again visited Twashtri. “I am very sad,” he said. “Pleasereturn the woman to me.” But after a while he came again and said, “Please takeher back.” This time Twashtri said, “No, you have to keep her!” Poor man! hecouldn’t live with her, but neither could he live without her.Women can complain, for their part, about men. Unless man and woman understandeach other’s nature, they ignorantly torture one another. Both were createdequal in God’s eyes; no man can come without woman, and no woman can comewithout man. It is the duty of man and woman to attain within themselves abalance between their respective predominating and hidden qualities. Man isguided more by reason and woman more by feeling. Each should strive for an innerbalance of both reason and feeling, and so become a “whole” personality, aperfected human being.Some people behave like donkeys. No matter how much they have suffered from theconsequences of sense slavery, they stubbornly go on nourishing their badhabits. They seem to have no memory whatsoever, quickly forgetting the painfulresults of sense indulgence and so never learning from their experiences.In nature all the different animals represent different emotions andcharacteristics; but man has them all in himself. He can act like the snake orthe wolf or the fox or the lion. Within us is the essence of hades and heaven.We should learn to express more of the heavenly qualities.Intuition Is the Surest Judge of CharacterThough an interesting study of character is possible through analysis of theeyes, the emotions, and the physical features, as has been pointed out, thegreatest and highest way to learn about character is through soul intuition. Ifyour mind and feeling remain perfectly calm, you will be able to feelintuitively and exactly the nature of each person you meet.My task is to take all kinds of people for training and help. It is not good toset a limitation on any human being, confining his possibilities to a certainanalysis; but whether he changes or remains the same, intuition will be able totell you, more than your diagnosis of the eyes, feelings, or physical features,whatever the nature of that person is. Intuition is the greatest analyticalpower. As a mirror reflects all things held before it, so when your mind-mirroris calm, you will be able to see reflected in it the true quality of others. Ifyou are busy doing good to all, remaining calm and meditative, the truecharacter of whoever comes to you will be revealed to you.[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0047.html#footnote-288-backlink] Matthew 7:1.2 [part0047.html#footnote-287-backlink] All creation is subject to the influenceof three inherent gunas or qualities: sattva, rajas, and tamas—spiritual orelevating, activating, and obstructing."},{"pageContent":"How to Be Happy at WillDate and place unknownAs you watch the faces of human beings, you can usually classify theirexpressions into four basic types, with corresponding mental states: smilingfaces, bespeaking inner and outer happiness; grim faces, denoting sadness; dull,unsmiling faces, revealing inner boredom; and calm faces, reflecting an innerpeace.A desire satisfied produces pleasure. A longing unfulfilled creates sadness.Between the mental crests of happiness and sadness are troughs of boredom. Whenthe high waves of pleasure and pain and the depressions of boredom becomeneutralized, the state of peace manifests.Beyond the state there is an ever new state of bliss, which the individual canfind within himself and recognize as the true native state of his soul. Thisbliss is buried beneath the exciting mental waves of exuberant pleasure and deepdepression and the hollows of indifference. When these waves disappear from themental waters, the placid state of peace is felt. Reflected in the calm watersof peace is the ever new bliss.Basis of ReactionsMost people in the world are tossing on the waves of exciting pleasure or pain,and when these are wanting, they are bored. As you watch the faces of othersduring the day—at home, in the office, on the streets, or at gatherings—you cansee that there are only a few who manifest peace.When you see a merry countenance and ask that person, “What makes you happy?” heis likely to answer in this way: “I had a raise in salary,” or, “I met aninteresting person.” Behind happiness lies the fulfillment of a desire.When you see a doleful face and make sympathetic inquiry, its owner may reply,“I’m a sick man,” or, “I lost my wallet.” His desire to regain health (or hislost money) has been contradicted.When you see a face registering a sort of blank neutrality, and you ask, “What’sthe matter? Are you unhappy about something?” he promptly answers in thenegative. But if you press him, “Are you happy?” he will say, “Oh, no, I’m justbored.”Negative and Positive PeaceYou may meet a refined, well-to-do man living on an estate, looking healthy andplump, and neither unduly happy nor sad or bored. In such case you might say heis peaceful. But when that comfortably fixed person has too much of this kind ofpeace—which few people have the good fortune to experience—he thinks within,“I’ve had enough peace—I need some excitement and diversion.” Or he may remarkto a friend, “Please give me a knock on the head to make me feel that I’malive!”The negative state of peace is derived from the absence of the three mentalstates of happiness, sadness, and boredom. Without change or excitement,protracted negative peace becomes stale and unenjoyable. But afterlong-continued indulgence in the happy, sad, and bored states, negative peace isenjoyable. For this reason, the yogis advocate the neutralization of the wavesof thoughts by concentration to achieve mental peace. Once the yogi has stilledthe waves of thought, he begins to look beneath the lake of calmness, and findsthere a positive state of peace—the ever new joy of the soul.I met a very wealthy man in New York. In the course of telling me somethingabout his life, he drawled, “I am disgustingly rich, and disgustingly healthy—”and before he could finish I exclaimed, “But you are not disgustingly happy! Ican teach you how to be perpetually interested in being ever newly happy.” Hebecame my student. By practicing Kriya Yoga, and by leading a balanced life,ever inwardly devoted to God, he lived to a ripe old age, always bubbling withever new happiness. On his deathbed he told his wife, “I am sorry for you—thatyou have to see me go—but I am very happy to join my Beloved of the Universe.Rejoice at my joy, and don’t be selfish by sorrowing. If you knew how happy I amto go to meet my beloved God, you wouldn’t be sad; rejoice to know that you willsomeday join me in the festivity of eternal bliss.”Drink Deep of BlissNow, after observing faces that register pleasure, sorrow, boredom, or temporarypeace, wouldn’t you rather that your face reflect the contagious ever new joy ofSpirit? To be able to do this you must drink and drink of His bliss from thecask of deep meditation until you become a bliss alcoholic, manifesting bliss insleep, dreams, wakefulness, and all circumstances of life that might otherwisetend to make you boisterously happy, or abysmally sad, or saturated with boredomor temporary negative peace. Your laughter must echo from the caverns ofsincerity. Your joy must flow from the fountain of your realized soul. Yoursmile must spread over all the souls you meet and over the whole universe. Yourevery look must reflect your joyous soul and spread its contagion to gloom-drunkminds.Stop dreaming that you are just an ordinary mortal, constantly going throughmental ups and downs. No matter what happens, remember always that you are madein the true image of Spirit. The living joy in all things—the Fountain of CosmicBliss—must shower you with Its spray, and send joy trickling through yourthoughts, through every cell and tissue of your whole being.Remember, for many hours in the state of deep dreamless sleep, which isunconscious soul-perception, you are happy all the while. So during the day,regardless of how much you are disturbed by nightmarish mental trials andupheavals, you must keep trying all the time to be inwardly ever newly joyous,like the ever-fresh laughing waters of a gurgling brook.As a man can be drunk with liquor all the time by continuously imbibing it, soalso can you be drunk with true happiness by continuously perceiving thejoyousness of your soul after meditation. When you can constantly feel theblissful after-state of meditation, you will live in ecstasy; you will be onewith the ever new Joy of your soul, and whosoever will be around you will belike you—even as the constant touch of sandalwood makes the hand fragrant.“Their thoughts fully on Me, their beings surrendered to Me, enlightening oneanother, proclaiming Me always, My devotees are contented and joyful.”1[part0048.html#footnote-289][../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0048.html#footnote-289-backlink] Bhagavad Gita X:9."},{"pageContent":"Steps Toward the Universal Christ ConsciousnessFebruary 17, 1935In this world we are limited by our thoughts. It is natural for us to be partialto our own ideas, but because of this partiality we often fail to recognize thatthe ideas of others may be bigger and better ones. When we learn to beopen-minded and not opinionated about anything, we grow in understanding andwisdom.A person is mentally free when his judgment is no longer influenced by theprejudices, customs, and conventions that are imposed on him by racial,national, and familial background. In the West you sit on chairs; in the East wesit on the floor, because the climate is extremely warm and the air is coolernear the floor. But one cannot say that everyone should sit on the floor justbecause the East finds it more comfortable to do so. National customs andconventions limit our outlook considerably; but as soon as we become free fromblind slavery to our provincial prejudices and habits, we can see truly what isright or wrong in any other nationality.As individuals we are to some extent limited by our desire to do whatevercontributes to our own personal good. Thus each human being is more or lessfenced in by his egoistic desires and experiences. As he increases the range ofhis experience, his consciousness begins to stretch; it is like a rubber bandthat can be expanded infinitely without breaking. Indeed, the more you stretchyour consciousness, the greater it will be.Learning to love our relatives is simply a training in stretching ourconsciousness. It is a preliminary practice in loving all others as we do ourrelations, whom we think of as our own. We have to learn to look on family andstrangers alike, because all are children of God. He has given you certainfamily members with whom you are practicing stretching your consciousness. Whenthe husband serves the wife, and she serves him, each with the desire to see theother happy, Christ Consciousness—God’s loving Cosmic Intelligence thatpermeates every atom of creation—has begun to express itself through theirconsciousness. Whenever you do something for someone else, without any selfishmotive, you have stepped into the sphere of Christ Consciousness.If you limit your love to your family, however, you have only that much capacityto express Christ Consciousness. When you love your neighbors as your family,your consciousness expands and you express a greater degree of ChristConsciousness. When you feel for all people with the love that you feel for yourown loved ones, when you have that soul preparedness to do for anyone else asyou would do for your own, then you are exactly expressing Christ Consciousness.Selfishness is destructive to one’s own interests; hence it is an unwise policyin any relationship or endeavor. Many of the customs in India give wonderfulpractice in expanding the consciousness through unselfishness. The mother nevereats until the children and the father have had their food. As a result theyfeel for her and have a sympathetic desire to share choice tidbits with her.However, to feel concern only for yourself and your own few loved ones is stillselfish. When you do something for others as feelingly as you do for self andfamily, you leave the little territory of selfishness and enter into the vastrealm of Christ Consciousness.So the first step toward Christlike unselfishness is to expand yourconsciousness to include your neighbors’ interests and well-being. It is notnecessary to give everything away; but you should have an intense desire to helpothers, and be prepared, mentally and physically, so that when the occasionarises you can do the same for your neighbors as you would do for yourself. Youcan do it, but you don’t. Whenever you find a lonely heart, or a brother weepingby the wayside, and your heart goes out to that soul, your consciousnessimpinges on the Christ Consciousness.Human love has its limitations. Family feeling is hemmed in by clannishness.Patriotic love is greater, for when you are ready to give up your happiness forthe welfare of your country, you have expanded your consciousness on a muchwider scale. And when you can feel for all nations as for your own country, yourlove manifests in an even greater way—you become a wider channel for theexpression of the universal Christ Consciousness. Jesus could say, “Who is mymother? and who are my brethren?”1 [part0049.html#footnote-297] because he wasaware that there is only the one love of God manifesting through all individualhuman relationships.In my consciousness I see no difference in an American, an Indian, an African, aGerman, a Frenchman, or an Englishman—that comes from the training I receivedfrom my guru, Swami Sri Yukteswar. Most parental, social, and educationaltraining tends to foster prejudices. I love all races and nationalities alike. Ido not want to be limited by attachment to any one country. After all, we areonly Americans or Indians for a little while; when we die we are all the same.If we are conscious of being world citizens, we have an expanded consciousness.Psychological Expansion of ConsciousnessYou can stretch your consciousness psychologically so that you no longer feelfor your little self, but rather for the good of the whole world as yourexpanded self. That is one way of expressing Christ Consciousness.Every day you think thousands of thoughts—about a thousand an hour. When you arewriting you are thinking, in about an hour and a half, twenty-five hundredthoughts. The ordinary human being thinks about twelve thousand thoughts a day.A deep thinker puts forth about fifty thousand. I have found that byconcentrating it is possible to produce as many as five hundred thousandthoughts in a day.I used to know a man in India who knew eighteen languages and was a Master ofArts in twelve of them. Think how many thousands of thoughts were passingthrough his brain! Yet he was never mixed up.You are to some extent conscious of every thought that you think duringwakefulness. If you receive a pinprick anywhere on your body you are instantlyaware of it. That means your consciousness is present in each of the trillionsof cells in the body. At the end of sixty years can you remember all thethoughts that you have had? It seems impossible. Yet all events of your lifehave been recorded in your subconscious mind, and that mind does recall most ofthose thoughts that were outstanding. The more you develop concentration andmemory, the more you can recall.Conscious, Subconscious, and Superconscious MemoryThe scope of the mind is very grand. God has given you waking consciousness,subconsciousness, and superconsciousness. Your conscious mind has certainlimitations; after a few years it begins to forget various things. But yoursubconscious mind has a greater memory capacity; every thought and experience isstored in the repository of subconsciousness. Your conscious mind may forgetevery word that I am saying, but your subconscious mind is registering them all.Behind the subconscious is your superconscious mind, which never forgetsanything. The superconscious mind has kept a record of everything you have done,every thought you have thought. When death comes, all these thoughts andexperiences flash through your mind before you leave the body. Those impressionsthat are strongest determine the environment and habits of your next life.2[part0049.html#footnote-296]As an ego your consciousness is present everywhere within yourself, and istherefore present in each thought that you think. If you can expand yourconsciousness beyond ego into the realm of superconsciousness, you can watchfrom that point all the thousands of thoughts passing through your consciousmind. Those who have developed the superconscious mind can remember all thethoughts of a lifetime, and of previous lives as well. In divine memory nothingis forgotten. Our thoughts are real and they are eternal, ever present in theether. All the sounds of the earth are recorded, also, in your superconsciousmind. Thus Jesus could say: “Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and oneof them shall not fall on the ground without [the knowledge of] your Father.”3[part0049.html#footnote-295]Think of fifteen hundred million people and the twelve thousand thoughts thateach one thinks every day. If your consciousness is aware of all those thoughts,several trillions of them, then you have Christ Consciousness: omniscience,conscious awareness of everything in creation.God gives man a mental barrier so that no one else can know his thoughts. Youare alone with your thoughts even though you may be with many people. Even thosewho have Christ Consciousness do not intrude on the thoughts of others unlessthey are ordained by God to guide others, or have been requested by theirdisciples to take that liberty in order to help them perfect their sadhana.Sympathy a Key to Christ ConsciousnessIf you would develop Christ Consciousness, learn to be sympathetic. When genuinefeeling for others comes into your heart, you are beginning to manifest thatgreat consciousness. When you talk unkindly about others, you are far from theuniversal sympathy of Christ Consciousness. Jesus said: “Bless them that curseyou.”4 [part0049.html#footnote-294] He practiced divine sympathy. Jesus foughtagainst those who were doing wrong; but he hated no one, because he saw God ineveryone. Lord Krishna said: “He is a supreme yogi who regards withequal-mindedness all men....”5 [part0049.html#footnote-293] Do not sully yourown thoughts and tongue by criticizing others. Be sincere with everyone, andabove all, be sincere with yourself. God watches you. You cannot deceive Him.God is the whisper in the temple of your conscience, and He is the light ofintuition. You know when you are doing wrong; your whole being tells you, andthat feeling is God’s voice. If you don’t listen to Him, He becomes quiet. Butwhen you wake up from your delusion, and want to do right, He will guide you. Heis always waiting for the time when you will return Home. He sees your good andevil thoughts and actions, but they do not matter to Him. You are His child justthe same.In your heart must well that sympathy which soothes away all pains from thehearts of others, that sympathy which enabled Jesus to say: “Father, forgivethem; for they know not what they do.” His great love encompassed all. He couldhave destroyed his enemies with a look, yet just as God is constantly forgivingus even though He knows all our wicked thoughts, so those great souls who are intune with Him give us that same love.The transcendental way to develop universal sympathy is meditation. The manwhose mind dwells in the superconscious state is always happy, always wise andloving, and always retains the after-effects of meditation. If you can retaineffortlessly that consciousness you feel just after meditation, you haveattained superconsciousness. When someone unknown comes before you, you willinstantly know all about that person’s life. But Christ Consciousness is stillfarther beyond: you feel everything in the universe in your consciousness at thesame time.By developing sympathy for all, you can expand your consciousness and learneverything there is to be known. Just as you are aware of your body and limbsand thoughts and brain simultaneously, so when you have Christ Consciousness youwill feel the bodily sensations of every human being you meet, and know all thethoughts they have ever had. When the scribes and the Pharisees brought anadulteress before Jesus for judgment he said, “He that is without sin among you,let him first cast a stone at her.”6 [part0049.html#footnote-292] How did Jesusknow about their private lives? He lived in the all-permeating divine ChristConsciousness. In that consciousness you are able to feel what others are doingand thinking. Sometimes you even forget momentarily in which body you areliving.Metaphysical Way to Christ ConsciousnessThe metaphysical way to Christ Consciousness is through meditation and holdingon to the after-effects of meditation. There are persons who read a few books ontruth and then say that they have attained Christ Consciousness, but you canhave that consciousness only through deep meditation and unceasing spiritualeffort. So don’t say you have Christ Consciousness until you have attained whatI have described. Your present consciousness is limited by the body, but whenyou expand it by deep meditation, you will become aware of the feelings of allpeoples. You will be able to know all things. Marvelous realizations will cometo you. Sometimes, when that state comes, you feel yourself simultaneously inthe stars, in the moon, and in every blade of grass.We are a part of the divine Christ Consciousness present in all creation. Eachindividual intelligence is a part of that vast Christ Intelligence. We are likethe jets in the burner of a gas stove. There are many little holes through whichthe flames are pouring, but under the burner there is only one flame. We arelittle flames coming from the big flame of Life. Beneath all the tiny jets ofhuman life is One Life; behind the flowers, behind all nature, is One Life.When you feel your consciousness in every pore of creation, you have ChristConsciousness. Beyond creation is Cosmic Consciousness. When you lift yourconsciousness from creation and see the vast eternal joy of God alone, you willbe in Cosmic Consciousness. When you are in tune with that Cosmic Consciousnesswhich is beyond this creation, you will understand that God begot HisIntelligence in the womb of creation, the “Virgin Mary”; and that thisIntelligence of God the Father, which is reflected or “born” in every atom ofcreation, is the Christ Consciousness or “only begotten Son.”The “Sons of God”The Indian name for this universal Christ Consciousness is Kutastha Chaitanya.In India we might also call it Krishna Consciousness, because the consciousnessof our great avatar Jadava Krishna, like that of Jesus Christ, was in tune withthe Christ Consciousness in everything. These two great ones had discovered theOne Life behind all life. By divine concentration and will in meditation, theyhad withdrawn their consciousness from the material world and seen that behindeverything in creation is the one reflection of God, the only son of God—theChrist or Krishna Consciousness.Jesus, Krishna, Buddha, Babaji—all are Christs. They had expanded theirconsciousness to receive Christ Consciousness. St. John declared: “As many asreceived him [the Christ Consciousness that was manifest in Jesus], to them gavehe power to become the sons of God.”7 [part0049.html#footnote-291]My guru, Swami Sri Yukteswar, manifested the Christ Consciousness. He was alwayscalm, and all my thoughts and feelings were reflected in the mirror of hiscalmness. Sri Yukteswarji wasn’t interested in what others were saying; he wasinterested in what they were thinking. It was impossible to dissemble with atrue teacher such as my Guru! His consciousness was aware of all that was goingon.The Christ Consciousness dwelt also in Lahiri Mahasaya. One day when he wasdiscoursing to his disciples on Christ Consciousness as explained in theBhagavad Gita, Lahiri Mahasaya suddenly cried out, “I am drowning in the bodiesof many souls off the coast of Japan!” The next day his disciples learned from anewspaper account of the deaths of a number of persons whose ship had founderedthe preceding day near Japan.Life and death are but a passing from dream to dream. They are only thoughts:you are dreaming you are alive, and you are dreaming you are dead. When you getinto the great Christ Consciousness, you see that life and death are dreams ofGod. Because Jesus lived in that consciousness he could say: “Destroy this[bodily] temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”8[part0049.html#footnote-290] He knew he could transform that dream of death intoa dream of life, even as God can.Develop sympathy and unselfishness if you would expand your consciousness. Ihave no consciousness of possession. I can leave everything in a moment if Godcalls, for I am not bound to anything. And yet all things are mine. In ChristConsciousness the whole world—everyone and everything in it—is your own. Thewhole of space and everything in it belongs to you.When you begin to feel the sensations of others as though they were happening inyour own body, you are developing that Christ Consciousness. When you cultivatethis consciousness and therein understand that everything is yours, you willhave no prejudices about race or color. In that consciousness you feel the loveof a million mothers in your heart, not just for a few but for everyone. You donot imagine it, you feel it—this love that Jesus, Krishna, all of the great onesmanifested—this universal intelligence and love which is called ChristConsciousness.[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0049.html#footnote-297-backlink] Matthew 12:48.2 [part0049.html#footnote-296-backlink] “That thought with which a dying manleaves the body determines—through his long persistence in it—his next state ofbeing” (Bhagavad Gita VIII:6).3 [part0049.html#footnote-295-backlink] Matthew 10:29.4 [part0049.html#footnote-294-backlink] Matthew 5:44.5 [part0049.html#footnote-293-backlink] Bhagavad Gita VI:9.6 [part0049.html#footnote-292-backlink] John 8:7.7 [part0049.html#footnote-291-backlink] John 1:12.8 [part0049.html#footnote-290-backlink] John 2:19."},{"pageContent":"Evenmindedness in a World of ChangeFirst Self-Realization Fellowship Temple at Encinitas, California, August 3,1939In the West we find emphasis on physical comfort. When the weather is too warmthe Westerner suffers without something to cool him, and when it is too cold heis miserable without warmth from artificial heat. But the masters of India teacha different philosophy. They say that sensitivity to heat and cold, pleasure andpain, accrues from the delusive suggestions of the senses and man’s habit ofcatering to sensations; and that he who is wise rises above all dualities. Thegreat ones do not suggest that man discipline himself to the point of doinginjury to his system; rather, they advise that when cold or heat is intolerable,one should free himself mentally from the sensation, at the same time seeking acommonsense remedy for the condition.The Gita teaches: “Those who are attached to sense pleasures cannot gain themental equilibrium of meditation; they fail to receive union with God throughecstasy (samadhi).”1 [part0050_split_000.html#footnote-302] Learning todisconnect oneself mentally from the disturbance of sensations brings peace ofmind. That man who remains untouched by the sensations that come and go, beingneutral to their ever-changing stimuli, manifests the soul’s essentialchangelessness; in that unchanging consciousness he becomes one with theChangeless Infinite.Slavish response to the various sensations of the body disturbs both mind andsoul. With the disturbance of the soul man loses his true nature, which iscalmness. God is present in the coldest and the hottest regions of the earth; Heis at the North Pole and in the African desert. He is not affected by anyextremes of His earth-creation, and we, being made in His image, should behavelike Him. He put us in this body that is subject to conditions of heat and cold,pain and pleasure; but He wants us to look on these dualities withevenmindedness. He wants us to rise above them. We should develop endurance,without being rash. When we cannot avoid excessive heat or cold, we shouldsimply disconnect the mind from it. The more we strive to practice this, themore the mind will free itself so that no unwanted sensations can touch theconsciousness.Pain Is Perceived Only in the MindThe skin’s surface does not feel touch sensations; they are experienced in thebrain. One cannot taste, touch, smell, hear, or see except through the mind. Weseem to experience taste on the tongue, but it is actually the brain thatregisters flavor. Similarly, when some part of the body hurts, the pain isreally in the mind, not in the body-part. We have two instruments for perceivingpain: the nerves and the gray matter of the brain. But we perceive only if themind allows a connection between them. Unless the mind says there is pain, thereis no pain. This is the marvelous discovery of India’s great masters. Underchloroform you do not feel pain, because sensations do not reach the mind. Atthe nerve endings there are fine fibers through which the pain sensations arerelayed to the brain. Chloroform prevents the relaying of these pain signals.The brain is the sensitive instrument of the mind, and all the sensations of thebody are reported to the mind through the nerves and the brain. The mind, beingidentified with the brain, receives and interprets these sensations. A mind madestrong by the practice of powerful and positive thinking is less affected bysensations of pleasure and pain. It recognizes sensations in the way Godintended—as a form of academic experience.Sensitivity was given to man only to protect the body; without sensation, onecould cut himself badly and not know it. Sensitivity was never intended to causepain. Animals have not developed this faculty to the degree that man has, hencethey experience less pain. Otherwise, the cruelty practiced on animals in somemethods of killing would be intolerable. The lobster is put in boiling waterwhile it is still alive!Because pain and pleasure are created by the mind, pain in the body can belessened by practicing control of the mind. Then one can experience a sensationwithout its producing pain, receiving only its guiding or warning message. TheBhagavad Gita goes very deeply into it, and that is what the Gita tells us.Oversensitivity to pleasure and pain strengthens their effects; reducedsensitivity makes one less subject to pain and less enslaved to sense pleasures.I have trained my body and mind to be less sensitive and have found myself freefrom sense disturbances. That training is the way to gain freedom.There was a doctor who had such mind power that he was able to perform a majoroperation on himself. The very thought makes the mind protest that one could notdo it, because the mind has been enslaved by bodily attachments. But mind can bemade powerful by training. The more you discipline your mind, the more it willbe under your control. A pampered child suffers greatly over even a little hurt;a Spartan-trained child may hardly wince at serious injury.You Can Free Yourself From the Sensory DictatorsIn this respect the system of training given in India under great masters isentirely different from that given in Western schools. Indian masters traintheir students to free themselves completely from slavery to the body and itssensations. The comforts and conveniences developed in the West encouragepampering the body; as a result, little or no effort is made to cultivate mentalstrength. In India we are trained from childhood to nip in the bud the dictatesof sensations. In my school at Ranchi we had the children sleep on little matson the hard floor, and they grew healthier. Westerners are conditioned to toomany external necessities in order to sleep well or be at peace. In India wewere taught to sit on the hot sand in meditation. Gradually we could sit in theheat all day long; and in the cold, likewise. As a result of this training Ifound such mental strength that nothing can affect or disturb my consciousness.When I disconnect my mind from the sense telephones, I am not bothered byanything.Some years ago the weather was terribly hot—extremely so. Everyone else waspanting. I was getting by mental association the discomfort they were feeling. Ihad intended to do some writing, but I was so uncomfortable I could notconcentrate. Then I chided myself, “What is the matter with you?” And I prayed:“Lord, the same electricity makes the heat in the oven and ice in therefrigerator. It is cool here.” All around me the atmosphere became cool, asthough a sheet of ice surrounded me. I began to feel great inspiration and wrotewithout any difficulty.Another time, many years ago, I was traveling across country in an open touringcar. Accompanying me were several young men, all Self-Realization students, oneof whom served as my secretary. He and I slept in the car, sharing one smallblanket. The night was freezing cold. When I went soundly to sleep he pulled theblanket completely off me; and when I half wakened from the cold Isubconsciously pulled the blanket off him! This went on for some time. Then mymind said: “Why are you behaving this way? It is all right. You are warm!” Ithrew off the blanket and began to meditate. My body became as warm as toast.The students were shuddering with cold when they awoke two hours later anddiscovered me sitting there, immobile. I was in divine ecstasy. They thought Ihad left my body! Roused from samadhi by their exclamations, I smiled and said,“What is all this commotion about? Let us resume our journey.” “But you weresitting in this bitter cold with no coat or blanket!” they protested.Nevertheless, I did not catch cold. I was the only one who was warm!What you must do is discipline your mind to be more positive. If you make upyour mind you are not going to catch cold, you will be less likely to catch one.The mind must be trained to overcome pain as well. Mental sensitivity magnifiespain. To magnify pain is to forget the indomitable image of God within you.Habits Begin to Form at Age ThreeThe ancient sages of India taught that all habits begin to form in man at theage of three. It is very difficult to change them after they are set. If yourfamily and environment create early prejudices in your mind, you may carry themthroughout life. One of the first things I learned from my guru, Swami SriYukteswarji, was to overcome mental prejudices toward sensations. At the time Ifirst came to him for training, I invariably caught cold if I didn’t use ablanket when the weather was chilly. But Master taught me differently. As aresult I became free of the cold-catching tendency I was virtually born with.Until Master’s training, I had caught colds one right after the other.Some people say we should depend only on mind, and others believe we shouldcater to bodily sensations. Both positions are extreme. According to one theory,it is good to have a physical examination regularly to see how the body isgetting along, just as one has his car checked over periodically. This issensible enough, but remember, you are not a machine. If your mental well-beingis too dependent on the condition of the body, a time will come when the mind isso enslaved by the body’s demands that no amount of any kind of physical aidhelps. This explains why we have chronic diseases. The physical debility becamechronic because the mind simply refused to be master of the body.In the beginning it is better to follow the moderate path. If you have a cut,put a little iodine on it, but don’t depend wholly on medicines. Take adequate,sensible precautions until gradually you can depend more on the mind. Even greatmasters have used medicines, which are, after all, God-created herbs andchemicals. Medicine is not necessary to a master, but to show that God’s powerworks in countless ways he may sometimes choose to use pharmaceutical remedies.In any event, victory lies in the power of the mind. When you know with absoluteconviction that you can do without all medication with no ill effect, you arevictor.A certain master who had broken his arm had it treated and bandaged. When a richman came to visit him shortly after, his worried disciples thought that thevisitor, seeing their master with his arm in a sling, might becomedisillusioned. “Don’t pay any attention to these devotees,” the saint remarked.“They imagine that because you see my broken arm you will think God doesn’t lookafter me anymore. And it is paining, too!” Another time this same master was inecstasy, singing about God, when he fell on a small pile of hot charcoal nearby.Still he went on singing to God. When the disciples picked him up, theydiscovered some of the hot coals clinging to his back, burning the flesh. Thedevotees were alarmed, but the master laughed and said calmly, “Well, why don’tyou remove them?” He never complained of any pain. Such is the mental abovenessmasters show. On this occasion the saint demonstrated that he was above pain,and on the other he showed that he was capable of human suffering and of bearingit humbly.Develop an adamant attitude toward the body. “The ideas of heat and cold, ofpleasure and pain, are produced by the contacts of the senses with theirobjects. Such ideas are limited by a beginning and an end. They are transitory;bear them with patience.”2 [part0050_split_000.html#footnote-301] Why be sosensitive about a little cold or a little pain? Think of the agony of those whosuffer in war. But even stronger than the patriot is the spiritual man; hedevelops a greater mental courage through disciplining his mind to endure, andultimately rise above, every kind of pain and trouble.Man’s Life Is Totally Independent of the BodyThe body is only a flesh-covered cage of bones in which the bird of life staysfor a time. The life itself is totally independent of the body. But the life hasbecome identified with the limiting conditions of the body; hence it suffers. Ifyou analyze body and mind you will find there is no connection between them,except what you give. Only in the daytime do you accept the sensations of thebody. At night in sleep, when your mind is detached from the body, you are notaware of its sensations; you feel a deep peace.Being made in the image of God, man can live in the body completely separatefrom physical sensations. But instead he adopts the conditions of the body asthough they were his own. To be free of sensations, one has to separate himselfmentally from the body. Therefore, the saints teach mental detachment from bothpleasure and pain. To understand and experience mental aboveness, one mustpractice it. I have proved this truth to myself, and I know how wrong it is tobe sensitive. Catering to sensations is the cause of all suffering and misery.God didn’t intend for us to suffer; He created sensory perceptions to guide andentertain us in the form of mental pictures. He meant for us to use thebody-instrument wisely, not to become so identified with it that it makes usmiserable. St. Francis called the body “Brother Donkey.” If one loves a pet dogwith a deep attachment, he will be sensitive to his pet’s sensations, eventhough he is not physically connected with the dog’s nervous system. In the sameway, our body-suffering is due to too much mental attachment to “BrotherDonkey.”The mind must acquire greater control over the body. To be able to live by thepower of mind is wonderful, because the mind can do whatever you want it to. Howto start depending more on mind? Little by little habituate yourself to heat andcold, to sleeping on a hard bed, to being less dependent on accustomed comforts.While I have been speaking to you I have been utterly unconscious of the hightemperature today; but just now as I mentioned the heat, I began to feel it.Once I was lecturing in Milwaukee when the weather was extremely hot. Inaddition, the heat inside my body had increased greatly, as it does when I amspeaking of spiritual things. My mind said, “You cannot continue the lecturewithout wiping your face; it is wet with perspiration.” I reached into my pocketfor a handkerchief, but found none. Then I looked in the spiritual eye andsuggested to my mind, “There is no heat at all.” Immediately the feeling ofoppressive heat vanished; I was calm and cool.The Right Way to Look at DeathPractice these things and see if what I am saying is not true. You can increasepain by sensitiveness and lessen it by mental detachment. When a dear one dies,instead of grieving unreasonably, realize that he has gone on to a higher planeat the will of God, and that God knows what is best for him. Rejoice that he isfree. Pray that your love and goodwill be messengers of encouragement to him onhis forward path. This attitude is much more helpful. Of course, we would not behuman if we did not miss loved ones; but in feeling lonesome for them we don’twant selfish attachment to be the cause of keeping them earthbound. Extremesorrow prevents a departed soul from going ahead toward greater peace andfreedom.Most of the people living on earth today were not here a hundred years ago.Others were here before us. And we who are now walking the streets of the worldwill not be here a hundred years hence. It will be all over for us, and the newgeneration will not give us a thought. They will feel, as we do now, that thisworld belongs to them; but one by one they too will all be taken away. Deathmust be good, otherwise God would not have ordained that it happen to everyone.Why live in fear of it?Those who are afraid of death cannot know their true soul nature. “Cowards diemany times before their death; the valiant never taste of death but once.”3[part0050_split_000.html#footnote-300] The coward lives over and over again amental picture of pain and death. The valiant experience only the final death,quickly and without pain. If one dies of natural causes or is spirituallyadvanced, the body of sensations simply drops off, and when the consciousnessreawakens on another plane it has all the sensations of the body without anyphysical form. Awareness is all mind, just as it is in dreams. This is notdifficult to picture. In death one merely sloughs off his gross physical body,which is only a lower form of mind and the cause of all manner of troubles forthe soul.Exude Peace and GoodnessThere are roughly two kinds of people: those who continually lament what iswrong with the world, and those who smile away life’s difficulties and remainalways positive in their thinking. Why take everything so seriously? Howwonderful this world would be if everyone were more positive, more harmonious!In the jungle of civilization, in the stress of modern living, lies the test.Whatever you give out will come back to you. Hate, and you will receive hate inreturn. When you fill yourself with inharmonious thoughts and emotions, you aredestroying yourself. Why hate or be angry with anyone? Love your enemies. Whystew in the heat of anger? If you become riled, get over it at once. Take awalk, count to ten or fifteen, or divert your mind to something pleasant. Let goof the desire to retaliate. When you are angry your brain is overheating, yourheart is having valve trouble, your whole body is being devitalized. Exude peaceand goodness; because that is the nature of the image of God within you—yourtrue nature. Then no one can disturb you.Good and Evil Are Created in the MindIn the ultimate sense, everything starts in the mind. Sin is created in themind. Little children go naked without any consciousness of sin. To thepure-minded everything is pure. To the immoral everything is evil. Anundisciplined mind causes great havoc in our lives. Sense-enslaved minds are theperpetrators of all wars, cruelties, and injustices.God put you in this sensate physical form with the intention that you live inthe world as an introspecting soul, enjoying the movies of creation withoutbecoming identified with them. That is how God wants you to live: to demonstratemind-control not only when everything is rosy, but in the midst of your troublesalso. Far from just talking about it, Self-Realization teaches you thatself-mastery. The dance of life and death goes on all the time; but man has themental power to rise above all sensory experiences of change, to be unaffectedby life’s inconstancy. The Bhagavad Gita offers us sublime assurance of thisfreedom: “The relativities of existence (birth and death, pleasure and pain)have been overcome, even here in this world, by those of fixed equal-mindedness.Thereby are they enthroned in Spirit—verily, the taintless, the perfectlybalanced Spirit.”4 [part0050_split_000.html#footnote-299]When you manifest changelessness you become a king among souls. Changelesswithin, even though body and mind are constantly changing, you become one withthe Changeless Infinite.The teaching of the Gita is inimitable. It deals in minute detail with life asit is, and shows how man should behave under all circumstances. It is correct tosay, “I am made in the image of God”; but having lost touch with that image youmust learn how to become one with it again. The message of the Gita shows theway. Gold that has been covered with several layers of clay will still be there,though hidden. To discover it you must break through the clay. Similarly, manyclaylike strata of habits and sensations cover the golden soul. This “mud” isthe cause of man’s nervousness and fear—of all ungodlike qualities. To removethe “mud” one must develop an impervious mental attitude toward the body and thesenses. What fears we have about the body! I have pictured and experienced in mymind all kinds of suffering, and have overcome them.When the Soul Commands, the Mind ObeysIn order to realize you are made in the image of God you must rise above fearand anger and destroy oversensitivity. Don’t be finicky. Say to yourself: “TodayI sleep in a bed; tomorrow I lie on the ground, it doesn’t matter. All is thesame to me.” Practice this mental neutrality, and the mind will do exactly whatyou tell it. The mind is extremely tricky, but if you train it, it will behave.When you say, “I can’t live without beefsteak,” the mind echoes, “I can’t livewithout beefsteak.” But if you, the soul, give the command, “Slavery, begone!”the mind will obey. So be not the servant of the body or the mind. Freedom fromsense slavery is the only way to peace and happiness. No matter what thecircumstances, rise above all mental sensitivity and make yourself truly andeverlastingly happy.The state of complete tranquility of the feeling (chitta), attained by yogameditation, in which the self (ego) perceives itself as the Self (soul) and iscontent (fixed) in the Self;The state in which the sense-transcendent immeasurable bliss becomes known tothe awakened intuitive intelligence, and in which the yogi remains enthroned,never again to be removed;The state that, once found, the yogi considers as the treasure beyond all othertreasures—anchored therein, he is immune to even the mightiest grief;That state is known as yoga—the pain-free state.

Would it not be (according toyour mood) a very amusing or pathetic spectacle if you suddenly beheld a crowdof such people?Now visualize another group of people who are normal so far as their physicalform and appearance are concerned, but who are mentally unsound and deformed. Asclothing hides scars, sores, and some deformities, so also the neat-looking garbof human flesh often covers serious mental maladies.If you were confronted with a vast crowd of average people, well-dressed andphysically healthy, and if you were gifted with the power to see their mentalbodies, what a surprise and heartache you would have. You would observe theirmental bodies—with reason as the head, feeling and senses as the trunk, and willas the hands and feet—to be abnormal, diseased, and deformed. You would see thatsome have a tiny head of undeveloped wisdom attached to a bulging trunk of senseappetite. Some would possess a withered body of pep and feeling, with the arm ofbusiness faculty very much overdeveloped in proportion. Others perhaps have alarge, creative brain, but the trunk of sympathy and feeling is shrunken anddried up. Still others, normal in head and body, would be seen to possessimpotent paralytic legs of will and self-control. You could go on and on.Such multitudinous psychological deformities in pathological mental bodies,underdeveloped in some directions and overdeveloped in others, lie concealedwithin man, causing suffering to his soul and hampering its expression on thematerial plane.It would not be out of place here to name a few of such psychological diseases,so that these invisible but prime causes of all havoc in human life may bedetected and their presence made known to the unconscious sufferers. Suchpersons may thus learn the nature, silent growth, and symptoms of these defectsand guard against the secret onslaughts of their happiness-destroying powers.Spiritual MelancholiaThis disease is prevalent among those who are mentally and physically idle underthe pretext of being too busy with spiritual things. These sufferers neglect thegreat and small duties of material life in the name of serving God, and thusinvite the devil to work his mischief in them. They suffer from pessimism andlack of appreciation for all things good and beautiful in the material life.This is a contagious disease, and all spiritual aspirants must guard themselvesagainst it by keeping their blood of energy warm and immune with constanthealthful worthwhile activity.Spiritual IndigestionThis results from indiscriminately swallowing a lot of mental patent medicinesin the form of pseudo-spiritual books and lessons by quack spiritual doctors.This disease kills not only the real hunger for Truth, but also destroys thepower to discriminate between good and bad teachings. He who eats theologicalideas all the time, and eats anything that he can get, will not only overeat butwill consume poisonous ideas along with the good, inviting first, spiritualindigestion, and finally, spiritual death. Long-continued overstudy of all sortsof philosophical principles and treatises, without any effort to assimilate themand test them out in one’s own practical experience, results in doubt,indifference, and disbelief in all spiritual laws.Sowing Mental “Wild Oats”Those afflicted with this disease lead a purposeless life, through having toomuch time or money on their hands and lacking a true aim in or understanding oflife. They are whim-led, doing anything that comes into their heads, fillinglife with cheap novels, exciting movies, or other unproductive pastimes. They donot realize their malady until some terrible shock or nervous breakdownovertakes them.Mental ColdThis disease is called despair. You don’t know when you are going to catch itand suffer from its unpleasant symptoms: congestive pains of despondency,intolerance, and impatience. Worst of all, it hangs on for a long time, and thevictim easily becomes reinfected even after seeming recovery.Mental CatarrhThis disease consists in harboring chronic worldly worries. Sufferers usuallyneglect to use their powerful weapon of will and therefore passively yield totheir constant fears instead of fighting and routing them.Psychological FixationIts victims become one-sided in the pursuit of happiness. They begin to thinkthat money is happiness, or that fame is happiness, or health, or power. Theysacrifice everything else—youth, reputation, peace of mind—on the altar of theirall-consuming ambition. They learn too late that the balanced life—observing allthe laws of nature and of God, and combining activity with calmness—alone canbring happiness and fulfill man’s natural destiny.Sufferers from psychological fixation become wholly obsessed with some oneambition until their perspective on life is warped and distorted. One man, forinstance, was very successful in his business and amassed a million dollars; butbefore he could use it he died of excessive worry and a nervous breakdown.Others, to gain fame, sacrifice their self-respect and sincerity. Sufferers fromthis disease of one-sidedness miss their true goal and can never derive realsatisfaction from the possession of the longed-for objective, since man’s natureis many-sided and demands all-round development.Religious FixationThis ism-fanaticism among so-called spiritual people results from clinging tosome dogma or opinion without putting it to the test of experience, and causesparoxysms of anger and hatred against the tested laws of Truth and liberalrational thought. This religious madness leads to disobedience to God’s simplelaws of mental efficiency, material prosperity, and physical health.Spiritual Principles Should Be TaughtPhysical diseases, being tangible, painful, and repugnant, arouse our activeresistance, and we seek to remedy them by exercise, diet, medicine, or someother definite method of cure. But psychological diseases, though the root causeof all human woes, are not prevented or attended to promptly and are allowed towreck and devastate our lives.Educators, physical culturists, preachers, reformers, doctors, and lawmakerswill hasten the true progress of civilization only when they themselves firstlearn, and then teach others, how to develop harmoniously all the factors oflife and of man’s nature. This is the true education and all-round human culturethat all the world is seeking.Educational authorities deem it impossible to teach spiritual principles inpublic schools because they confuse them with the varied conflicting religiousdogmas. But if they would concentrate on the universal principles of peace,love, service, tolerance, and faith that govern the spiritual life, and devisepractical methods of growing such seeds in the fertile soil of the child’s mind,then the imaginary difficulty would be dissolved. It is a great mistake toignore this problem just because it is seemingly difficult.Many college graduates leave their universities with a top-heavy, book-inflatedhead, and are unable to walk straight on the path of life because their legs ofwill and self-control have been almost paralyzed through disuse. They tumbleheadlong into the pit of wrong marriage, sex misuse, inordinate dollar-craving,and business failure because they have not been taught any use of theircollege-sharpened mental blades of smartness except to hurt themselves. Manyyoung men seem to take pleasure in doing those things that react to their owndisadvantage and suffering in the end. Last year in America young men ranging inyears from fifteen to thirty stole a billion dollars by the “hold-up” method.Who was responsible? We are—all of us. They also are vicious who do not preventthe spread of vice, and who do not teach others to be virtuous through theirexample. Schools, colleges, and society have not tried scientifically to preventcrime by eliminating its true mental cause.“How-to-Live” Schools Are NeededWhy not take the proper educational steps to avoid this annual theft of abillion dollars, and use some of those millions for creating “how-to-live”schools, where the art of living and a balanced development of all humanfaculties would be taught?I consider properly organized schools as gardens where infant souls are grownand nurtured. The gardeners should be well selected and given cooperation byparents and the public. We should never neglect teachers, for they are soulmolders. The care and spiritual nourishment of the early life of a human plantusually determines its later development.I sincerely praise the modern school system of America and its constantlyimproving methods of intellectual and, to a certain extent, physical training.But I cannot fail to point out its main shortcoming: a lack of spiritualbackground. The system badly needs to be supplemented with moral and spiritualtraining. The boy who belongs intellectually to Class A, or who is a greatbaseball or football player, often attracts notice and is encouraged by theteacher, but very few observe or warn him rightly if he is leading a dark ClassD moral or spiritual life.Where is there such a school, one that adopts definite measures for developingthe whole nature of man, teaching him the true art of life and fitting him to gothrough the various minor tests and ultimately the final examination of life?Such schools are urgently needed to teach the arts and sciences of all-roundgrowth.In such a “how-to-live” school, the science of physical, mental, and spiritualdevelopment should be taught to children whose minds are still plastic and whoseenergies are as yet unguided into any definite channel. Adults too may masterthe subjects in night school, if they will exercise willingness and patiencewhile the good habits are displacing the undesirable ones.After a thorough training, the students of such a school should undergoceaseless introspective examination throughout life; and the various diplomaswon will be health, fame, efficiency, wealth, and happiness.The results of the final examination at the end of this earthly sojourn will bedetermined by the sum total of achievements and mental and spiritual diplomaswon at the various examinations throughout life. Those totally successful inthis last great examination will receive a diploma of divine self-sufficiency, afree and joyous conscience, and blessings, engraved eternally on the parchmentof the soul. This rare reward is incorruptible by moths, beyond the reach ofthieves and the eraser of time, and is awarded for honorable entry into theFellowship of Truth."},{"pageContent":"Increasing the Power of InitiativeMay 23, 1927Looking at the vast panorama of this world, at the crowds of humanity rushinghot-haste through their span of life, one cannot but wonder what it is allabout. Where are we going? What is the motive? What is the best and surest wayto reach our destination?Most of us rush aimlessly, like runaway automobiles, without any plan. Dashingheedlessly along the road of life, we fail to realize the purpose of our travel;we seldom notice if we are on winding devious ways that lead nowhere, or onstraight paths that lead directly to our goal. How can we find our goal, if wenever think of it?Many people, though unaware of life’s destination, nevertheless have enoughinitiative to determine what they want and to seek it. In connection with theirpersonal desires and with changing their environment, they try to use theinitiative within them to create what they want. What is that initiative? It isa creative faculty, a spark of the Infinite Creator within each one of us.Think of a dozen people you know; aren’t the minds of most of them likeone-horsepower engines? Many people make similarly limited use of their creativeenergies. The whole process, the main activity of their lives, consists chieflyin eating, working, amusements, and sleeping. When life is so lived, what is thedifference between man and the animals? One difference, psychologists say, isthat man is the only creature that laughs. It is good to laugh; if you don’temploy that power, you lose one aspect of strictly human development. Don’t belike those people who, day in and day out, take life so seriously they areafraid even to smile. They don’t enjoy life at all.Besides the unique ability to laugh, man has another superior quality, one ofthe greatest of all qualities—initiative. What is this mysterious faculty?America is a land of initiative in business, in applied mechanics; India is aland of initiative in spirituality. Initiative is the power to create; to createmeans to do something that nobody else has done; it is trying to do things innew ways, and trying to create new things. Initiative is that creative abilitywhich is derived directly from your Creator. What have you done in your lifewith this divine gift? How many people really try to use their creative ability?Weeks, months, years pass, and they are always the same; they have not changed,except in age. The man of initiative is as glorious as a shooting star—creatingsomething from nothing, making the impossible possible by the great inventivepower of the Spirit.Don’t Be a One-Horsepower PersonThere are three kinds of people with initiative—the extraordinary class, themedium class, and the common class; and there are hundreds of others huddledtogether in a “no man’s land” of nonentity. Ask yourself this question: “Have Iever tried to do anything that nobody else has done?” That is the starting pointin the application of initiative. If you haven’t thought that far, you are likehundreds of others who erroneously think they have no power to act differentlythan they do. They are like sleepwalkers; the suggestions coming from theirsubconscious mind have given them the consciousness of one-horsepower people. Ifyou have been going through life in this somnambulistic state, you must wakeyourself by affirming: “I have man’s greatest quality—initiative. Every humanbeing has some spark of power by which he can create something that has not beencreated before. Yet I see how easily I could be deluded with the mortalconsciousness of limitation that pervades the world, if I allowed myself to behypnotized by environment!” But if you say, “Every avenue of activity is alreadyovercrowded; why try at all?” you are allowing yourself to be hypnotized by afrustrating worldly consciousness. That is why in every walk of life so manymen, lacking initiative, remain unsuccessful.On the spiritual side, also, many people passively follow the same paththroughout life. Even though unsatisfied, they unthinkingly remain in thedenomination to which their families belong. Or perhaps they were born Baptists,but a change of residence places them near a Congregational Church, so theybecome Congregationalists. Man ought to adapt himself conscientiously, accordingto his inner dictates, to all life’s experiences. He should not act blindly.My guru, Sri Yukteswarji, used to say, “Remember this: if you have within youthat faith which is truly divine, and if there is something you desire that isnot in the universe, it shall be created for you.” I had that indomitable beliefin an inner strength, in the spiritual strength of my will, and I always foundthat some new opportunities were created to give me the things I wanted.The power of initiative within you remains undeveloped, unformed, unexploited,unused. That power is native to the soul; it has actually been given to all ofyou, but you have not used it. How can you acquire initiative? If you have notdeveloped the power to think creatively for yourself, or the initiative to makeyour own way, your first attempt should be to try to improve on what someoneelse has done. The effort to make improvements on the inventions of others isthe most common form of initiative.The second or medium quality of initiative is shown by people who write orinvent something new, but of no particular significance.The best or most extraordinary quality of initiative is that which makes youstand out before the world in a blazing flame, like a Burbank or an Edison.Those were men of invincible initiative, spiritual initiative. Was God partialto these great men, that they possessed this particular greatness? Were theychosen by Divine Will to take so much glory? No. They simply used theirinitiative to bring forth the greatness and the glory that is every man’sbirthright as an immortal child of God. Those who look for personal glory arenever great; inflated with pride, they lack any real support from God. Those whoenjoy giving—whether it be strength, courage, music, art—are great men.Most people who have become great have been subconsciously guided: they had atinge of greatness in their heredity that gave them an initial advantage. Theyused that hereditary advantage in their life to become extraordinary, to becomeoutstanding. If you have a quality of greatness, you have been unconsciously ledby forces of mind whose power enabled you to change your environment byreincarnating, and in that new environment to bring forth the greatest floweringof your initiative. In this sense, great men are “born.”You Must Discover the Power You HaveBut I know that great men can also be made, or developed from seemingly nothing.There is a way to become great, to acquire this extraordinary power ofinitiative. By wisdom, by right training, and by practice of theSelf-Realization teachings you can develop that power of initiative and bring itinto full play. The ones who made the struggle long ago are the ones who now seethe fruition of their activities. You must discover the power you have; you muststrive to overcome apparent impossibilities.You must be prepared to withstand the critical opinion of the world in order tosucceed in a great way in any vocation. You must stay away from one-horsepowerpeople in order to be original—to think differently, to speak a littledifferently. And be untiring in your zeal. The man of extraordinary initiativeswallows up all difficulties, believing in his heart that he is right. Withunflinching steadiness march on your path, realizing that behind you is theinfinite Creative Power.You must first get yourself into conscious contact with that Infinite Power. Itis the Source of all initiative, and when you contact that superconscious Power,your conscious and subconscious minds also become filled with power. Long ago Iwas apprehensive lest the little initiative I had developed would disappearquickly under difficult tests. I know now that within myself is that greatinfinite Principle, which is the Source of all art, all music, all knowledge. IfThat is behind me, I cannot fail.Whenever you want to create something wonderful, sit quietly and go deep inmeditation until you have contacted that infinite, inventive, creative Powerthat is within you. Try something new, but always be sure that that greatcreative Principle is behind anything you do; and that creative Principle willsee you through. Every human being is meant to be guided by the boundlesscreative power of Spirit. You have choked with doubt and laziness the fountainof creative power within you. Clear it out! Show dauntless determination ineverything you do.Most people are content to feed themselves on dead quotations, to go oncollecting the ideas of others, without ever showing the individuality that iswithin themselves. What is distinctive about you? Where is the great uniquenessof God’s power in you? You have not been using it.The Lord’s Infinite Power Sustains YouI was reluctant, at first, to become a teacher—the implications frightened me. Ateacher has to be a shock-absorber; the minute he becomes disturbed, he cannothelp those who seek his aid. A true teacher has to love everybody; he has tounderstand humanity, and to know God. But when Sri Yukteswarji told me that myrole in this life was to be that of a teacher, I called on the Lord’s infinitepower to sustain me. When I started to give lectures, I made up my mind that Iwould speak not by book learning but by inner inspiration, holding the thoughtthat behind my speech was the inexhaustible Creative Power. I have also utilizedthat Power in other directions, to help people in business and in many differentways. I have used mortal mind to reflect Immortality. I did not say: “Father, doit,” but, “I want to do it, Father. You must guide me; You must inspire me; Youmust lead me.”Do little things in an extraordinary way; be the best one in your line. You mustnot let your life run in the ordinary way; do something that nobody else hasdone, something that will dazzle the world. Show that God’s creative principleworks in you. Never mind the past. Though your errors be as deep as the ocean,the soul itself cannot be swallowed up by them. Have unflinching determinationto move on your path unhampered by limiting thoughts of past errors.Life may be dark, difficulties may come, opportunities may slip by unutilized,but never within yourself say, “I am done for. God has forsaken me.” Who coulddo anything for that kind of person? Your family may forsake you; good fortunemay seemingly desert you; all the forces of man and nature may be arrayedagainst you; but by the quality of divine initiative within you, you can defeatevery invasion of fate created by your own past wrong actions, and marchvictorious into paradise.Though you be defeated a hundred times, be determined that you are nonethelessgoing to conquer. Defeat is not meant to last for an eternity. Defeat is atemporary test for you. Naturally God wants to make you invincible, to have youbring into play the almighty power that is within you, so that on the stage oflife you can fulfill your high destined role.God Meant the World for Our EntertainmentHow are you going to find out what role suits you? If we all want to be kings,who will be the servants? On the stage the parts of a king and of a servant areequally important if the roles are played well. You must remember that that iswhy we are sent into this world with differences, with desires for variousvocations. God meant the world to be a play, a huge spectacle for ourentertainment. But we forget the Stage Manager’s plan and want to play our partas we see fit, and not as He desires.You fail on the stage of life because you are trying to act a part differentfrom the one divinely designed for you. Sometimes the buffoon attracts moreattention than the king; so no matter how obscure your role, play itconscientiously. Tune yourself with Spirit, and in this earth-drama you willplay your part well.You are not meant to suffer. Those who play tragic parts must realize that theyare but enacting a role. Never mind which part you have to play; always striveto act it well, in harmony with the direction of the Stage Manager, so that yourlittle role will enlighten others. Realize that an aspect of the infinite powerof Spirit is performing through you on the stage of the world.Infinite Spirit creates new success. Infinite Spirit does not want you to be anautomaton. Attune yourself to Cosmic Power, and whether you are working in afactory, or mixing with people in the business world, always affirm: “Within meis the Infinite Creative Power. I shall not go to the grave without someaccomplishments. I am a God-man, a rational creature. I am the power of Spirit,the dynamic Source of my soul. I shall create revelations in the world ofbusiness, in the world of thought, in the world of wisdom. I and my Father areOne. I can create anything I desire, even as my creative Father.”"},{"pageContent":"Who Made God?Circa 1949The enigmas of God’s creation, and of how He Himself came into being, almightyand powerful, have been pondered in every heart that yearns to know about God.No scripture has fully elucidated these seemingly unanswerable questions. But ifyou contemplate and try to feel the entire perception of the subject as I shalldescribe it, you will find the answers to these questions—answers that Ireceived from the very depths of my soul and from God.The Infinite, God, is the ultimate cause of all finite creation. He projects thepower of maya, the storm of delusive relativity—the illusion that the One hasbecome the many—which, blowing over the ocean of His Being and His vibratorywish to create, stirs into manifestation the waves of finite creation. “Unbornthough I am, of changeless Essence! yet becoming Lord of all creation, abidingin My own Cosmic Nature (Prakriti), I embody Myself by Self-evolvedmaya-delusion.”1 [part0053.html#footnote-307]Manifesting Himself as the creative Cosmic Intelligent Vibration, and using thehelp of the storm of delusive relativity, God forms out of Himself all finitevibratory waves of mind, energy, and matter: electrons, protons, atoms,molecules, cells, and blocks of solid matter—clusters of island universesfloating in the sphere of space, surrounded by wandering radiations.Thus Intelligent Cosmic Vibration is the first manifested cause of all createdthings, though the different finite forms of matter are created or causedsecondarily by arrangement and combinations of certain basic forms: cells derivefrom molecules, molecules from atoms, atoms from electrons and protons,electrons and protons from lifetrons, and lifetrons from thoughtrons2[part0053.html#footnote-306] of the Infinite.Creation exists, and is caused by God; therefore God exists. We can say thatintelligent creation exists because of an intelligent God. But who created God,out of whom all things else have come? The Infinite Himself.3[part0053.html#footnote-305] The law of causation applies only to finiteobjects; it does not apply to the Infinite. As all waves on the ocean becomedissolved in the ocean, so all finite objects manifesting from the aforesaidfinite causes lose themselves in their Eternal Source. Similarly, the law ofcausation operates outwardly in creation, but is lost in the Infinite.Through the law of causation, our original parents—the finite creations known asAdam and Eve, who themselves were special creations of the Infinite—helped tocreate all humanity. Because we are created by our parents—and our parents byour grandparents, and all mankind has come from Adam and Eve—we ask who createdGod. We apply to the Infinite the law of causation that created us. This iserroneous reasoning.Varying PerspectivesWhen you are dancing with the waves of the ocean, you can’t get a perspective ofthe ocean as a whole; but from the air you have a bird’s-eye view of its vastexpanse. Similarly, when you concentrate on creation and are immersed in it, youcannot see anything but creation and the law of causation working therein. Butwhen with closed eyes you learn how to look within, you see neither finite formsnor the law that created them, but glimpse the formless, causeless Infinite.In the wintry land near the North Pole, an Eskimo who was hunting seal looked upand saw a Hindu traveler approaching him.“Where did you come from, my friend?” he asked.“My home is India,” the stranger replied.“Well, well!” said the Eskimo. “Do Hindus find plenty of good seal meat inIndia?”“Oh, no, we don’t have any at all,” replied the amused visitor. “Hindus livemostly on vegetables.”“What a foolish statement,” thought the Eskimo. “No one can live without sealmeat!”Just as the Eskimo, knowing no other diet, thought all people ate seal meat, sofinite creatures, being themselves created by the law of causation, naturallythink that the Infinite God also came into being through the law of causation.Spirit Is Free From CausationSo it is foolish error for finite, causation-born human beings even to question,“Who made God?” The Infinite made the law of causation that created all finitethings, though the Infinite Itself exists without having been caused. As anabsolute monarch may make all the laws in his kingdom without being bound bythem, so the King of the Universe makes all the laws in His kingdom, includingthe law of causation that governs His finite creation; but He is not subject toHis laws. “I, the Unmanifested, pervade the whole universe. All creatures abidein Me, but I do not abide in them.”4 [part0053.html#footnote-304] Though presentin all things, God is in no way bound by finitude.Therefore the Infinite is. We deduce His existence and omnipotence from Hispowerful manifestations in creation. His power is fully active in the manifestedstate. And during cosmic dissolution, all power, cosmic intelligence, and thelaw of causation become inactive and dissolve into the Absolute, there to awaitthe next cycle of God’s creative manifestation. The forces of the storm thatcreate waves in the ocean are manifest in the waves. But no power is manifestedwhen the ocean is still. Similarly, in the creative state, the Infinitemanifests intelligence, mind, vibration, forces, and matter. And in theunmanifested state, the Infinite exists solely as Spirit, in which all forceslie dissolved. Out of space come light, nebulae, and weather, and into spacethey dissolve and hide again. That sphere beyond manifestation is the hidingplace of Spirit.The Infinite, beyond the categories of vibratory intelligence, energy, space,and time, is thus a thing in Itself. It can be felt and known as the eternalPower that exists without a beginning or end. Creation is caused by God, but Godsimply is. No one, nothing made God—He has been and will be what He is foreverand forever. “O Arjuna! there is nothing higher than Me, or beyond Me. Allthings (creatures and objects) are bound to Me like a row of gems on a thread.”5[part0053.html#footnote-303] This cannot be understood so long as you consideryourself a created being, subject to laws of cause and effect. But as soon asyou become one with God in ecstasy, you will know exactly how and what Godis—Beginningless, Endless, Causeless. Then, being one with Him, you will knowthat you too are the Causeless Eternal. As a mortal man you are a creation madeby God; as an immortal man of realization, you will know yourself as a wave inthe ocean of God, the one and only, self-sustaining, ever-existing CosmicConsciousness.[../images/00011.jpeg]1 [part0053.html#footnote-307-backlink] Bhagavad Gita IV:6.2 [part0053.html#footnote-306-backlink] The name given by Paramahansa Yoganandato the first and most subtle manifestation of the creative vibration emanatingfrom Spirit; the primal ideas behind all matter.

Likewise the physicalbody of, let us say, Henry Jones, manifests weight, form, dimension, andvisibility; the thought of Henry Jones has none of these qualities of matter.Yet a powerful mind, versed in the art of visualization, can in a hallucinationor a consciously produced dream see Henry Jones, shake hands with him, weigh himon a scale, and see that he is tall and slight. A visualization, hallucination,or even a dream representation of the body of Henry Jones is more real than themere thought concept of his body, because dream objects are apperceived by thesenses of touch, taste, smell, sight, and hearing.1 [part0054.html#footnote-313]What then is the difference between a thought of Henry Jones; a visualization,hallucination, or dream perception of Henry Jones’s body; and his livingphysical body?Difference Between Illusion and DelusionOne could take the view that the physical form of Henry Jones is real becausevisible to all, and that the dream conception of him is unreal because visibleto only one person. Is it not possible, however, that the reality of thephysical body of Henry Jones—and of all other human beings—is a delusion? FromIndia has come the philosophical concept of maya, delusion or mental errorcommon to all individuals; and of avidya,2 [part0054.html#footnote-312] illusionor mental error as experienced by each individual.On the other hand, one individual may understand certain truths that are notsimilarly realized by all. Thus men of divine understanding, who haveexperienced the truth about the nature of God and man, are sometimes wronglyaccused of illusions and hallucinations by those who are yet in thrall to cosmicdelusion. It is not right for those under maya to decry the testimony of one whois not. Only he who has transcended cosmic delusion through his own innerrealization may correctly judge the truth.The average person thinks of the physical body perceived by the senses as real,and regards a mental, imaginary, or dream concept of the body as unreal. Let ussuppose that by television a picture of Henry Jones’s form is transmitted fromDetroit to the Los Angeles Times headquarters. Are the viewers in Los Angelesseeing the real Henry Jones? The ordinary person would say yes.The Cosmic Magician’s Grand IllusionA metaphysical master sees delusion within delusion as illusion. He can see thephysical body of Henry Jones as a delusive form—like a mirage of a city—notnothing, but something, yet not what it appears to be. The man of realizationwould ask what makes us so sure that the physical body is not a delusion sharedby everyone? Can we be certain that all human beings are not merely dreamingabout the body of Henry Jones and other material forms? If man really iscircumstanced by God to dream within a cosmic dream, then we all may be dreamingthe existence of the body of Henry Jones. In which case we cannot distinguishwhether the body of Henry Jones actually exists or not.By certain stereoscopic and vitaphonic effects, the great magician Thurstonmight show to his audience the form of Henry Jones floating in the air andtalking, and suddenly spirit it away. Is it not possible, then, that the greatCosmic Magician might be showing us true-to-sound, true-to-sight, true-to-touchsuperpictures of the body of Henry Jones and of everyone and everything else increation? If so, then anyone under the influence of this stereoscopic vitaphonicsuperdrama might create the form of Henry Jones by mental motion pictures of hisown—”home movies,” you might say. In this case, the people who are under thecosmic delusive influence created by God would think, “That person is sufferingfrom illusion,” even though they themselves are victims of the cosmic delusionby which they see the metaphysically untrue, but mundanely true body of HenryJones. So, if everything in creation consists of dream pictures in theconsciousness of man, then all is delusion, and the mental picture orhallucination of one person, based on the reality of the physical body of HenryJones in this cosmic dream-world, is delusion within delusion, or illusion.The wise man who awakens from the influence of the cosmic dream perceives thephysical body of Henry Jones and all matter as a delusive cosmic dream, and themental concept of matter or Henry Jones as a delusive dream within God’s cosmicdream. A mental error or illusion in one person can be corrected by others whodo not participate in the error; but an error shared by all cannot be correctedby any except those who have attained Self-realization, and who thereby know thetruth that “things are not always what they seem”3 [part0054.html#footnote-311]to the senses.How Consciousness Became MatterThe only difference between consciousness and matter, mind and body, is rate ofvibration. Vibration is the motion of energy. How did this motion originate fromthe Cosmic Intelligence? All the vibrations in the ether are manifestations ofthe Intelligence-guided cosmic energy. Spirit as the unmanifested Absolute iswithout vibration or motion. Spirit manifested as the Creator is God the Father.The Creator first stirred His still Spirit with the motion of thoughts; thus Godthe Father’s first projection of creation was cosmic intelligent motion, orvibration of thought.4 [part0054.html#footnote-310] This motion became strongerand grosser until it changed outwardly and manifested as cosmic light and cosmicsound (registered in the human body as the visible spiritual eye and the audiblecosmic sound of Aum or Amen). The vibration of the conscious cosmic energybecame progressively more gross, until it began to manifest as divine,semi-intelligent, instinctively guided electronic energy, and finally as thestill grosser forms of gaseous, liquid, and solid energy.Likewise the microcosm, or body of man, came into being first as a vibratorythought-form, the causal body. This in turn produced the grosser vibrations thatmake up the astral or energy body of man, which produces the still grosservibrations that structure the solid physical body. Just as man uses electricallyprojected light and shadows and sounds to create a stereoscopic vitaphonicpicture of a human being on a movie screen, so the Cosmic Operator combinesvarious thought-frozen vibrations of cosmic light and energy to produce in man’sconsciousness the “picture” of a solid physical body.Wrong Thoughts Obstruct God’s Perfect Thought-PicturesBy partially obstructing light from the projector, the projectionist of a slidefilm may produce on the screen a picture of a man without a hand; he can easilyrestore the hand by letting the light flow freely through the film. Similarly,the consciousness or manifestation of disease is nothing more than anobstruction, created by wrong human thought, in the perfect thought-feeling ofman that God created. Man is heir to the failings of his forefathers.Hereditarily he has become habituated to imperfection. His wrong thoughts notonly obstruct the perfect thought-pictures of life and body, they also impedethe free flowing of the cosmic life force, which is responsible for manifestingand perpetuating the delusive picture of the human body.The amputation of a hand in an auto accident is no more real than is theamputation of the hand of the man on the film screen in the foregoingillustration. However, unless one is an accomplished “projectionist,” he may notbe able to correct, in the superpicture created by God, a distortion of seeminghurt or disease in his body. The delusive nature of bodily accidents cannot beknown until one can transfer his consciousness into the operating chamber ofCosmic Consciousness and get acquainted with the secret methods of the CosmicProjectionist. By His self-evolved cosmic thought-films and self-frozen cosmicenergy, He is trying to show perfect pictures of man (made “in His own image”),and of all life, all worlds, and the cosmos. Through ignorance, man has fallenout of tune with the divine will, and thus obstructs the perfect presentation ofGod’s stereoscopic vitaphonic superpictures of life.A block of ice is solid, heavy, cold, and visible. If allowed to melt, itbecomes liquid, yet has the same weight, remains cold, and is still visible, butin a different form. If electricity is passed through the melted ice, it becomesinvisible hydrogen and oxygen. So the one block of ice can be changed from avisible, cold, solid mass to invisible, intangible gases with the same weight.The process may be reversed, and the gases recondensed into liquid and frozeninto the vanished block of ice. Similarly, the solid human body can be reducedto liquids and evaporated into invisible gases; but man has not yet learned howto bring it back in its original form. Not yet does he know the link betweenmind and body, Spirit and matter. That missing link is cosmic energy.Finely vibrating conscious energy becomes pure consciousness, and, vibrating atincreasingly grosser rates, manifests as the body. When by use of his will manattains supreme control of the energy in his body, he will be able to melt thevibrations of his solid physical body into astral energy, and the astral energyinto mental energy. And by the same method he will be able to materialize hisconsciousness into the astral body and condense it into the physical body. TheGita refers to this power. “He who realizes by yoga the truth of My prolificmanifestations and the creative and dissolving power of My Divine Yoga isunshakably united to Me. This is beyond doubt.”5 [part0054.html#footnote-309]Scientists today can control chemical changes of the body, but they do not yetunderstand the biochemical control of matter. With understanding of the relationof will and body comes the realization that the body is not dependent on foodchemicals alone, but on energy supplied by the will from the invisible cosmicsource. The will is the chief bringer of life force into the body. Like a humandry battery, a human body in a state of suspended animation can live withoutoxygen, sunshine, solids, liquids, breath, or heart action; but deteriorationinevitably follows when consciousness, and therefore will, has completely leftthe spinal column and the brain regions.Will, the Cosmic EnergizerEvery movement of the body parts presupposes movement of will, and with everyaction of this invisible radio of will, energy is radiographed into the bodyfrom the storage battery in the brain and the conscious cosmic energysurrounding the body. When you are tired you can put energy into the body byeating food, or by inhaling oxygen, or by absorbing ultraviolet rays ofsunshine, or by drinking water or other liquids; but as you tense your arm andbody in willing to lift a heavy weight, you are bringing energy into the body bythe invisible mental force of will. In the tensing of body parts withconcentrated will,6 [part0054.html#footnote-308] we find the only instancewhereby we can create energy in the body; not from physical sources outside thebody, but from the invisible source existing both within and without thebody—the intelligent cosmic energy of God.To attain mastery over cosmic energy, the missing link between consciousness andmatter, body and Spirit, is to realize the true nature of the Self—of everythingin creation—and the oneness of all with the Creator.[../images/00018.jpeg]1 [part0054.html#footnote-313-backlink] The instruments of sensory perception(eyes, ears, etc.) belong to the physical body, but sensory perception itself isa function of man’s astral body of subtle electricities.

Every mother is a manifestation of God’sunconditional love, though human mothers are imperfect, and the Divine Mother isperfect. I pray that all mothers live such a godly and impartial life that theirlimited human love becomes transmuted into the pure all-embracing love of theDivine Mother.My mother was everything to me. My joys rose and set in the firmament of herpresence. I was still but a boy when Father and I, in Bareilly, received wordthat Mother was seriously ill. We entrained at once for Calcutta: Mother hadgone there to supervise preparations for the wedding of my elder brother Ananta.At a transfer point we were met at the station by my uncle. I felt a terribleconviction that Mother was already dead. I asked anxiously if she was stillalive. A train was thundering toward us, and I had inwardly determined to throwmyself beneath its wheels if Mother were dead. Correctly interpreting thedesperation in my face, Uncle replied, “Of course she is alive!” But when wereached our Calcutta home, Mother was gone. I was inconsolable. I loved Motheras my dearest friend; her solacing black eyes had been my surest refuge. I havedescribed in a poem an actual experience of mine at that time:Merely affection-saturated, many black eyes called—Offering to nurseMy motherless sorrow—this orphan life of mine.But none matched the love-call glanceOf those lost two dark eyes.The love of those two black eyesHad forever setFrom the region of all black eyes that I beheld.Seeking those two eyesIn birth and death, in life and dreams,And in all the lands of the unknown,At last I foundThe all-pervading Divine Mother’sCountless black eyesIn space and heart,In earth-cores, stars, within, without,Hungrily staring at meFrom everywhere.Seeking and seeking my dead mother,I found the Deathless Mother.The lost love of the earthly motherI found in my Cosmic Mother. Seeking and searching,In Her countless black eyesI found those two black eyes.If only you could share with me the thrill that I felt when I suddenly becameaware of those black eyes of my Mother watching me from everywhere, from everyspeck of space! What an experience it was! All my sorrow became changed intojoy.Human relationships are given to you, not to be idolized, but idealized. If youalways think of your mother as the unconditional love of the Divine Mothermanifested in human form, you will be comforted when she is gone. The mother whohas passed on is not lost to you; she is a representative of the Divine Mother,who came to mother you for a short time and then was taken away, to remainconcealed behind the omnipresent love of the Divine Mother. Those who have losttheir mother must find the Divine Mother hidden beyond the skies. You don’t praydeeply enough. Implore Her with continuous demand, with the resolve not to ceaseuntil Her reply comes. If you will pray in this way as earnestly as I did, youwill receive an answer from the Divine Mother; and you will see your earthlymother.Now I behold every woman as a mother. Even when only a little goodness isreflected there, I see the Divine Mother. Men should look upon all women asmothers; they do not know what they miss when they look upon woman merely as anobject for the satisfaction of passion; they see then only the evil that iswithin themselves. In the mother aspect of womanhood there is purity. Woman wasgiven the motherly instinct to save man from the pitfall of evil. That is herprimary purpose; she was not created as an object of lust. Nothing is moresacred than the unconditional sympathy of woman toward man. A stern, dignifiedcourt judge is but a child to the wife in his home. Every woman should feel lovefor all the world if she would manifest the Divine Mother’s love. To inspiremankind with mother love is to bestow the greatest blessing a woman possesses.God Is Both Father and MotherIn creating this universe God revealed two aspects: the masculine or fatherly,and the feminine or motherly. If you close your eyes and visualize vast,illimitable space, you become overwhelmed and enthralled—you feel naught butpure wisdom. That hidden, infinite sphere wherein there is no creation, no starsor planets—only pure wisdom—is the Father. And Nature with her diamond-dazzlingstars, the Milky Way, the flowers, birds, clouds, mountains, sky—the countlessbeauties of creation—is the Divine Mother. In Nature you behold the motheraspect of God, full of beauty, gentleness, tenderness, and kindness.1[part0055_split_000.html#footnote-317] The beauty in the world bespeaks thecreative motherly instinct of God, and when we look upon all the good in Nature,we experience a feeling of tenderness within us—we can see and feel God asMother in Nature.So God is both Father and Mother. The Christian and Hindu scriptures describeGod as triune: Father, Son, Holy Ghost—Sat, Tat, Aum. The Father is the wisdomaspect of God; Holy Ghost, the mother aspect; the Son is cosmic creation—theemblem or principle through which the father and mother aspects of God expresstheir divine love. We are the children of that love. “As above, so below”—in thehuman family we see in miniature the greater family of the Holy Trinity: God theFather represented in the human father; Holy Ghost or Nature manifested in themother; the Son symbolized in the child, expression of the love of both fatherand mother.Jesus spoke of God as Father. Some saints speak of Him as Mother. In Histranscendental aspect, God is neither Father nor Mother; but when we think ofHim in terms of human relationship, He may become for us either Father orMother. God is both infinite wisdom and infinite feeling. When He manifestedHimself in creation, God gave His wisdom a form in the father; and He gave Hisfeeling a form in the mother. Each, alone, is imperfect, only half of God’snature, because the father moves and is moved by reason, whereas the mothermoves and is moved by feeling. The father wants to govern the child by reason;the mother, by feeling.The mother says, “Teach him by love.” Sometimes a great deal of love is good;but if you give too much sweetness, and that only, you may spoil the child.Sometimes a little strictness is good, but severe punishment for errors onlydrives a child to greater error. This is why the two aspects of God must bemanifested through the parents in the upbringing of the child; both arenecessary for its ultimate welfare. Every father should strive to temper hisreason with love, and every mother to temper her love with reason.When I think of my guru, Sri Yukteswarji, I see in him the sternness of a fatherand the kindness of a mother, without the weaknesses or blindness of either.Every father and every mother is potentially endowed with both the fatherlywisdom and the motherly tenderness of God. They have to perfect theseendowments. Parents so easily become blind to the faults in their offspring! Ifyou can’t see your child’s faults, there is something wrong with your love.Parents should learn to love their children unconditionally, without allowinglove to blind them to errors in a child’s action or thinking. They should lovetheir child in spite of any misdeed, but should not support him in his error.Help your children to extricate themselves from the pitfalls of evil, ratherthan drive them farther down by supporting them in their wrongdoing. They won’treturn any love to you for that misguided indulgent love.Pure Reason and Pure Feeling Are IntuitivePure reason and pure feeling both have intuitive qualities. Pure feeling sees asclearly as pure reason. Most women have a keenly developed intuition. Only whenthey become unduly excited do they lose their intuitive powers. Pure reason isalso intuitive, if this power is sufficiently developed. Otherwise, should thepremise be wrong, the conclusion will be wrong also. Sooner or later, every manwho reasons clearly will develop true intuition, which never errs.A jealous, hateful, angry woman will see these qualities reflected in others. Ifshe continually harbors such destructive emotions, she will lose, alas, herintuitive gifts. For this reason every woman should strive to be less emotionaland to keep herself free from wrong emotions. She will then develop thatintuitive mother-aspect of God. My mother had great intuition because she wasentirely free from jealousy, hate, and anger.God never forsakes anyone. When, having sinned, you believe your guilt to bemeasureless, beyond redemption; and when the world declares you of no accountand says you will never amount to anything, stop a moment to think of the DivineMother. Say to Her, “Divine Mother, I am Your child, Your naughty child. Pleaseforgive me.” When you appeal to the mother aspect of God there is no retort—yousimply melt the Divine Heart. But God will not support you if you continue to dowrong. You must forsake your evil actions as you pray.Confession embodies a sound principle. The act of confessing may be likened tocalling a doctor when you are ill from transgressing health laws. You areobliged to tell the doctor your symptoms, and he forthwith prescribes for you,and you receive healing. But if you violate nature with wrong practices timeafter time, you will never remain healed. I know a boy who always boasts, “I cando anything I please, for I will be forgiven next week when I confess.” This isthe wrong view. If you don’t forsake the evil as well as confess it, you willnot be forgiven.The divine man develops both the fatherly and motherly qualities in himself. Hecan feel toward anyone the same love a mother has for her children. These werethe feelings of Jesus when on the cross he said: “Father, forgive them, for theyknow not what they do.” How could he know such love for those who werecrucifying him? He had developed both the fatherly and the motherly aspects ofGod. To Jesus the men nailing him on the cross were not enemies with javelinsand spears; they were his children who didn’t understand him. Who but a mothercould think of them as Jesus did? A mother whose son is torturing her is afraidonly of what may happen to him. This is what Jesus understood; this is how hecould say, “Father, forgive them.”If you develop the motherly aspect of God, you will feel love for all the peopleof the world. And if you appeal to God as the Divine Mother, She quickly givesin, for you have appealed to Her tenderness and unconditional love. When youworship God as the Mother, you can stand and face Her and say, “Divine Mother,naughty or good, I am Thy child. I may have been in the clutches of evil formany incarnations, but do I have to make full recompense according to Thy law? Icannot wait so long a time to enter Your presence! Mother, please, forgive me!Why must You exact punishment of me? What is done is done. It is all past. I amnot going to sin again.” The Divine Mother may reply: “You are naughty; go awayfrom Me.” But you must say, “You are my Divine Mother. You have to forgive me.”Then She says: “Ask of Me salvation; I will give you salvation. Ask of Mewisdom, and I will give you wisdom. But do not ask of Me My love, for when youtake that away I have nothing.”2 [part0055_split_000.html#footnote-316] If youcontinue to cry, “I want Your love!” the Divine Mother finally melts: “Since youare My child, and I am your Mother, how can I but forgive you?” And She givesyou Her last possession—Her divine love.A Vision of Divine MotherIn India I used to visit the great saint Master Mahasaya.3[part0055_split_000.html#footnote-315] On my first call at his home I happenedto disturb him at his devotions. He invited me to sit down, adding: “I amtalking to my Divine Mother.” His whole countenance shone with the reflection ofHer love, and I could feel the intense vibrations of that great love. Whenever Iwas in his presence while he was communing with the Cosmic Mother, the love Iexperienced in my heart was a thousand million times more than that I felt formy earthly mother, whom I so dearly loved; at such times I thought I could notexist another moment without my Divine Mother.“How is it that you can commune with the Beloved Mother and I cannot?” I said tohim one day. “Please ask Her if She loves me. I must know!” Insistently Ipleaded until finally the saint agreed.“I will make your plea to the Beloved.”That same night in meditation I had a great divine experience: Seeking theseclusion of my small attic room as soon as I arrived home, I meditated untilten o’clock. Suddenly the darkness was lit with a beauteous vision. The DivineMother stood before me, tenderly smiling.“Always have I loved thee! Ever shall I love thee!” With these words Shedisappeared.It was barely sunup the next morning when I hurried to the saint’s home. I sawby his eyes that he was wandering in the gardens of the Infinite; such love ofGod is rarely seen.“Did the Beloved Mother say anything about me?” I asked.“Mischievous little sir!”“What did Divine Mother say? You promised to tell me,” I chided.Again he answered, “Mischievous little sir!” I knew in my heart that he couldsee through my subterfuge, yet I had been deliberately hiding my thoughts inorder to learn if my experience the previous night was real.“Why so mysterious?” I said. “Do saints never speak plainly?”“Must you test me?” he replied. “Could I add a single word this morning to theassurance you received last night from the Beautiful Mother Herself?”Bliss flooded my being. I prostrated myself at the saint’s feet; I knew theDivine Mother was walking in them. He it was who gave me the revelation and theunderstanding of the mother aspect of God. He told me that later my Guru wouldcome to me, one who would be endowed with the wisdom aspect of God: “Through hisguidance, your experience of the Divine in terms of love and devotion shall betranslated into his terms of fathomless wisdom.”A Test of FaithI will tell you a little story about Divine Mother and an experience I had withHer. On the grounds of Self-Realization Fellowship headquarters there is a smallwishing well of cast concrete. Shortly after its purchase I was helping the boysto move it into place. The well accidentally slipped and fell with all itsterrific weight on my foot. There was terrible pain and much swelling in thefoot, which seemed completely mashed. I was carried to my room. My friendswanted to call a doctor.“If Divine Mother tells me to see a doctor,” I said, “I will go to one. If Shedoes not, I won’t go.”I waited, hoping to feel inwardly what Her wish might be. Day by day the pain inmy leg became almost unbearable; there was no sign from Divine Mother.The following Sunday I had a large class to teach. It seemed that I would haveto be carried to the platform. I could not get my foot into a shoe. Satantempted me that Sunday, saying, “Why don’t you pray to be healed?” But to praywould have been to doubt. Divine Mother knew my plight, and I was willing toabide by Her wish.“I am not going to pray,” I said. “The Mother knows what is wrong with me.”Inwardly I vowed my unconditional surrender to Her: “Whether sunk beneath thewave of death or moving on the oceanic waves of life, I am with Thee evermore.”“Look at these people,” Satan spoke again. “They will all laugh at you. Theyhave never seen you sick before, and now they will see you with an injuredfoot.”“I don’t care.” Once you have Divine Mother’s love, neither praise nor blame cantouch you.I was limping along toward the platform where I was to speak, when inadvertentlyI slipped on the threshold; my injured foot was badly twisted. So great was thepain, I felt as if every bone in it had splintered. But the moment I steppedforward again the terrible swelling collapsed suddenly, all pain gone; I wasable to slip my foot into a shoe.That was one of the greatest demonstrations of the power of love that I haveever experienced. I walked as if nothing had ever been wrong with my foot.Needless to say, I was thrilled—not because of the healing, but because of theDivine Presence. She wanted to see if I would pray for a healing. Had I prayed,perhaps in due course of time the injured foot would have had a naturalrecovery; but I would not have had that all-assuring divine experience.Another time, in Palm Springs, I was singing to the Divine Mother: “Mother, Igive You my soul call. You can’t remain hidden anymore! Come out of the silentsky, come out of my cave of silence.”4 [part0055_split_000.html#footnote-314]Suddenly She appeared! I saw Her in the stones, the palms, everywhere! God hasno form, but to please a devotee He can take any form that devotee desires. Youhave no idea how wonderful the Divine Mother is; how great She is; how lovingShe is!There is no greater experience than to feel and know that the Cosmic Mother iswith you. Watch for the presence of the Mother, because She will look after youin every way, whether your trouble is sorrow, pain, or sickness. Pray to God asthe Divine Mother when you crave solace, and when you seek wisdom pray to God asthe Divine Father.Mothers, do not limit to your child alone the all-forgiving love you bestow onhim. Give to everyone the love and understanding of the Divine Mother, and youwill be bound no longer by the limitations of an earthly mother’s love; you toowill be a divine mother. When you can truly say, “I feel as a mother to allmankind,” you will no longer see others as strangers; you will recognize andlove all children of the world as your own. All forms of human love, in theperfect state, are encased in the love of God.Judge yourself no more a sinner; cast off your wrong habits and pray, “Mother, Iam Thy child. Reveal Thyself!” If you send this appeal to God as the DivineMother night and morning, unceasingly, She will manifest Herself unto you.Let us give thanks to God, and pray for His blessing on all mothers, that theybe enabled to manifest His qualities.May all the sons and daughters of the world be filled with that motherlyaffection which is the reflection of the Divine Mother’s unconditional love; andmay they give that unconditional motherly love to one another, that we havepeace and heaven on earth.[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0055_split_000.html#footnote-317-backlink] In this context, ParamahansaYogananda is emphasizing what we have come to regard as true “motherly”qualities, the gentle and loving responses we find in a mother’s nature. Onother occasions, Paramahansaji has also pointed out that form and qualitiespresuppose manifestation, and manifestation presupposes relativity. MotherNature must also enforce the inherent and inexorable cosmic laws of theuniverse. Break those laws, and Divine Justice dispenses its correctivepunishment; hence the fierce demonstrations we sometimes behold in nature. Theseare results of man’s own wrongdoing, which throws the cosmic harmony out oforder. (See karma [part0074.html#_idTextAnchor102] in glossary.) But theconsistent beauty of Divine Mother is that if the devotee appeals to Herunconditional love, She may be persuaded to assuage the retaliatory power ofthose laws. Thus in Hinduism, Divine Mother is sometimes depicted as Kali; herfour arms symbolize cardinal attributes, two beneficent and two destructive—theessential duality of Mother Nature.

The souls of allcreatures, through unconscious recollection of their divine origin, tendnaturally to seek their Source. This accounts for the upward evolution ofeverything in the universe. But, in conformance with God’s plan for creation, itis only upon attaining a human body, with its superior brain and nervous system,that each soul is at last endowed with the means to remember consciously itsoriginal oneness with Spirit.Memory is that power by which we mentally reproduce our experiences. If it werenot for memory we would forget all our perceptions of life; we would have tostart afresh, like infants, every day. A person who has “lost” his mind, andhence his memory, behaves like a child.There is no value in having experiences if we cannot recall and relive them. Welearn by introspection and by analyzing our past behavior. In man’s memory liesthe value of being a human creature. John remembers that he is John each morningupon awakening; and it is through memory that he associates his life experienceswith his identity as John.Whenever we wish it or need it, any experience that we have had can bereproduced by the subconscious mental faculty. By remembering what we have donebefore, we can perform again some skillful action that we have learned, orreason out which actions to repeat or avoid in a particular situation.The subconscious mind is always active, recording experiences during the daytimeand working even in sleep, looking after the bodily house like a night watchman.Upon waking, one always knows whether he has had a good or a bad sleep. Thatmemory power of the subconscious mind is a faculty of the ever awake, everjoyous Lord. Implanted in each soul is the memory seed of that consciousness,for the soul knows itself to be ever living in God. Memory is the seed ofimmortality by whose cultivation we may recall all the events of this life andof our past lives.Develop Divine MemoryIf we can remember all our experiences as mortal beings in this life, why is itthat we do not recollect all the divine experiences that have happened in thesoul? Memory has two natures: mortal memory reproduces the experiences of thislife, and divine memory reproduces the experiences of the soul throughout allits incarnations. Most people are aware only of mortal memory.Why is our divine memory asleep? Some people are able to recall manyexperiences, both mortal and divine; others cannot well remember even theirrecent past. Memory has different grades in different people according to braincapacity. Education, concentration, meditation, and various memorableexperiences are required to develop a good memory. Without developing memory onecannot become a well-educated person. If one has an experience and subsequentlyforgets it, all values of that experience are lost to the conscious mind.By improving the quality of memory, we can make it powerful enough to rememberall things, even our divine origin. By awakening the divine memory, whereby wecan recall every experience of all our past lives and ultimately realize ourimmortal soul nature, salvation is attained.Effect of Physical Exercise on MemoryAsanas2 [part0056.html#footnote-318] and proper physical exercise are useful indeveloping memory power. Today, when machines have replaced manual activity inso many functions and departments of life, man is becoming physically lazy andis in dire need of regular exercise. He has begun to devise mechanical and othertypes of indoor equipment to help him exercise his body.When one performs physical exercises, it is necessary to concentrate the mind onthe activity in order to reap the fullest benefit. It is not just the flexing ofmuscles, but the inner power of concentration to awaken and redirect the lifeforce that gives the body strength.Foods That Increase Memory PowerThere are certain foods that are brain foods; and there are muscle foods, nervefoods, and foods that help to build up and maintain the different body organs.As an aid in developing memory we should eat foods that increase brain power.Proteins are helpful in developing memory. Ground-up pecans and almonds, mixedwith a few drops of lime or orange juice and taken before bedtime, will improveone’s brain power, yogis say; milk and cheese also are good brain foods.Yogis suggest that, at times of worry or strain, one should drink the juice ofone or two limes in a glass of water, rinse the head with cold water, and applycold water on the temples, between the eyebrows, and at the nostrils and ears.The nerve processes are calmed immediately, the mind becomes more peaceful, andgood memory returns.Avoid eating too many fatty foods, which tend to cause fatty deposits to buildup in the blood vessels on the surface of the brain. The Hindus say that porkand beef are injurious to man’s health; these two meats contain much uric acid.The pig and cow have poor memories. By eating their flesh, man may develop theirphysical and mental traits.Practice Exercising MemoryMemory can be developed by exercising it. It is incorrect to say that a man whowas born a physical weakling can never become strong. There is always thepossibility of becoming and accomplishing something greater in all departmentsof our lives. One has to know how to seek the right ways. Similarly, accordingto some doctors, a person who has a hereditary mental weakness will retain thatmental defect to the end of his days. But it has been proved that many mentaldeficiencies may be overcome by the practice of concentration exercises. Therehas been little research in this direction in the West; hence many psychologistsare unacquainted with the art of deep concentration, which has been taught forcenturies by India’s great yogis.The correct methods for developing concentration are unknown to most people. Themental faculties are there, but they are not developed. Failure to develop one’smental capacities eventually leads to serious trouble. The brain, like thephysical body, requires right exercise for health.To develop a good memory, therefore, one should not only exercise the body andeat health-building food, but should also engage in mental discipline. Make aneffort to remember things. Practice the art of visualization: look at a certainobject or at scenery and then try to reproduce that picture in your mind. Tryingto recall the strains of songs and chants, and singing them mentally, developsmemory. Anything that is done with feeling, or that rouses feeling, developsmemory. Both poetry and music have emotional values. All of us remember easilythe greatest sorrows and the greatest joys of our lives. Why? Because thoseexperiences were felt deeply. Anything that one strongly feels develops one’spower of memory. Writing poetry, and adding and subtracting mentally are alsogood methods for developing memory and concentration.Meditation Strengthens MemoryTo increase one’s power of memory, one should do everything with deep attention.Most people carry on their activities absentmindedly; there is a great gulfbetween their actions and their thoughts. That is why they cannot rememberanything very well. What one wants to recall he should perform with greatattention. One should not be fussy, but whatever he undertakes should be donewith his whole mind. In church one should listen to the sermon with keenattention. Work at tasks in the home with attention and interest. Keeping theconscious mind on the task at hand does not prevent one from reflectingconstantly on God in the background of his mind. But when one meditates, heshould think only of God. The power of memory is strengthened by meditation.What is meditation? Becoming one with the soul. It means banishing theconsciousness of being related to the body and to human limitations, and tryingto remember that one is a soul. When man begins by conscious mental effort torelate himself to the immortal soul, rather than to the body that he inhabitsfor one life only, he will recall more of his past-life experiences, and willeventually remember that he has come down from the bosom of God. In Him lies thememory of all the experiences of one’s life and of all lives. When man communeswith his soul within, the forgotten times and powers of the deathless Self willcome back into his consciousness. Meditation means to remember that one is not amortal body but an immortal soul, one with God.During the daytime we tend to think of ourselves as human beings, but atnighttime in deep dreamless sleep we forget our mortal attitude. In meditationwe can try consciously to forget our mortal identification; we can abandon theconsciousness of the body and remember we are Spirit. Those who persevere inthis practice will become masters.Remember Good ExperiencesMemory was given to man to reproduce good. To abuse the power of memory isharmful. To think hatefully of another person because of some remembered injuryhe inflicted on you is a misuse of memory. However, to recall unhappyexperiences in order to learn the lessons inherent in them is a proper use ofmemory, as then one may analyze his past behavior and avoid repeating in futurethe wrong acts that brought painful results. One should not bring back any wrongthought and relive it; for then it will stay longer in the mind. Memory wasgiven to us to keep alive only life’s good experiences and lessons. Get rid ofwrong past thoughts by avoiding recalling them. If they come to mind in spite ofyou, refuse to entertain them.Let me repeat: to remember bad experiences and dwell upon them is an abuse ofGod’s gift to us of memory. Rather one should vow, “I shall use memory only torecall good thoughts and experiences. From this moment I banish from my mind allunpleasant memories. They belong to the mortal being. I am a child of theSpirit. I am going to see, hear, taste, touch, feel, and will everything that isgood. I shall take only the good from my life’s experiences and shall preserveonly the good in my memory.” Banish forever the abuse of memory.A person who feels good emotions, and thinks good thoughts, and sees only goodin nature and people, will remember only good. Memory was given to you topractice the recollection of good things until you can fully remember thehighest Good, God. Beholding goodness in everything, you will certainly findthat one day the Invisible Power will shatter all the little windows of thoughtsand sensations and feelings through which you have been seeing only glimpses ofthe divine harmony in creation; you will behold through an infinite opening theomnipresent Goodness, God.Rouse the eternal flames of divine memory until they burn away yourforgetfulness, and you remember that you always have been, and are even now, onewith the Lord.[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0056.html#footnote-319-backlink] This talk was one of a series of outdoorSummer School classes that Paramahansaji conducted at the headquarters on Mt.Washington. He taught under a large pepper tree that he called “The Temple ofLeaves.”2 [part0056.html#footnote-318-backlink] Bodily postures of Hatha Yoga.

Though it is very subtle and hard to discernin the beginning, if you can penetrate to the inner realm through the door ofthe spiritual eye2 [part0057.html#footnote-325] you will discover it. I live inthat garden—a region of exquisite qualities, of tender thoughts more sweet andfragrant than any flower. There the bee of my mind is continuously drinking thehoney of God’s presence.As we interiorize our concentration and live more and more in that invisibleland within us, we find that our soul qualities take special forms; eachmaterialization is a window through which we perceive the Lord’s indescribablesweetness. Don’t think that the search for God consists only in meditation.Every good quality that you express in thought and action yields the hiddennectar of God’s presence, if your inner perception is deep enough.When we pass through the door of the spiritual eye, we see inside ourselves thefactory of intelligent Life Energy that has created the whole universe. Becausewe don’t concentrate within, we are mystified by the imprints of the invisibleSpirit in nature. We behold the productions of God; His name is written in theflower and in the sky, in everything—but He is silent. As human beings we arevery much privileged, for among all God’s creatures man alone has the physical,mental, and spiritual endowment necessary to seek Him, to find Him, to know Him,and to understand His language of silence.What Is a Successful Life?A child pictures success as having all kinds of playthings, and perhaps a toycar to ride in. A poor child thinks how happy he would be if only he had a lotof toys. A wealthy child, on the other hand, may be bored with his playthings;he has a restlessness in his soul. In time it may become very difficult toplease the child of the rich, for he already has so many possessions. When weare older, we laugh at the desires of our childhood; and who knows but thatwhatever we are wishing for now, thinking it will bring the fulfillment of ourlife’s dream, will one day have little significance for us? I found this to beso. I didn’t want to become drunk with emotions, heedlessly bent on the folliesI saw others pursuing, and I looked farther on. If we gaze a little ahead we cansee for ourselves that most of the things we think we want are not going to makeus really happy.Success is necessary in order to possess the essentials of life: food, clothing,shelter, and health. If you don’t have these to at least a certain degree, youare in a wretched position. You should be able to attain the minimum amount ofcomfort and happiness that you are seeking. Whether one is a spiritual or amaterial idealist, all persons can agree that there are a few basic physicalneeds that must be met so that man can preserve his bodily temple. Unless hemaintains this temple, he cannot succeed in anything else.Happiness Is a Creation of Our Own MindBut what is real success? If you attained everything you wanted in this life,you would eventually become disillusioned anyway. By analyzing I saw for myselfthat the only pleasure I had in anything was that which my mind gave to it. If Iwithdrew my attention, enjoyment of any object vanished. Thus I saw thatpleasure is internal, a concept of one’s own mind. The beauty of your mostvalued possession, which you may be holding in front of your eyes, disappearswhen your thoughts are absent from it. Only when you put your mind on it do youperceive its loveliness. Therefore it is reasonable to say that within us, andnot outside us, lies most of the happiness we are seeking.We can magnify our happiness or minimize it. One person has a little home andsays, “I enjoy it more than a palace.” Someone else has a palace in which hedoes not take as much pleasure as the other person has in his unpretentiouscottage. The secret of success and happiness is inside you. If you have foundsuccess and prosperity outside, but not inside, you are not truly successful. Amillionaire who is not happy is not successful. I don’t mean that if you have amillion dollars you cannot be a success. Whether you are rich or poor, if youget happiness out of life you are a real success.Pleasure that lasts only for a moment and leaves you with regret afterward isnot happiness. In true success, even though the first excitement of delight insome accomplishment fades away, the gratifying memory of fulfillment remains.All the good things that you have done in your life stay on in your memory as ajoy forever. They are the real success that you have attained.To Be Happy Under All Circumstances Is Real SuccessSuccess is not a simple matter; it cannot be determined merely by the amount ofmoney and material possessions you have. The meaning of success goes far deeper.It can only be measured by the extent to which your inner peace and mentalcontrol enable you to be happy under all circumstances. That is real success.When you can look within and your conscience is clear, your reason unprejudiced,your will firm yet flexible, and your discrimination strong; and when you areable to obtain at will the things you need and the things you considerworthwhile, you are a success.As a child you could be happy with little things, but now you tend to think youhave to own several homes and cars, even though you can see that those who havethem are not invariably happy. Plain living and high thinking make forcontentment. Keeping your mind on the plane of ideas will give you morehappiness than if you dwell on externals. Those who are preoccupied mostly withlooking after their home, their possessions, their dress, are not necessarilycivilized. You can dress up a dog, but that doesn’t make it civilized. Thedifference between man and the dog is that man can voluntarily change hisconsciousness and his nature. He can penetrate deep within, into the region ofthe Spirit, where the dog cannot. Man’s love is transcendental. When we die, thedog may grieve for us a little while, in some cases till death, but humanfriends never forget us (if they don’t want to!) throughout incarnations. Somankind has tremendous advantages over other creatures.Evolutionary Human Progress Lies in the Power of ThoughtAs a human being, you make your greatest evolutionary progress by the power ofthought. Set aside some time each day to improve your mind. It is morecommendable to read awhile than to occupy yourself day and night with houseworkor with noncreative activities. Plan your life so that you do not live in ahaphazard way; but if your tendency is to overorganize your time, get away fromthat extreme also. Balance is necessary in every avenue of life. Instead ofusing your mind only to plan your everyday work and other passing activities, orwith idle mind letting your time slip away, employ it some of the time inconstructive reading. Have at hand some worthwhile reading material, and peruseit during free moments. It is more effective to have a variety of literature—abit of science, a bit of history, philosophy, biography, travel—anything thatwill expand and inspire your mind.Books can be dear friends, and if your selections are choice ones you willexperience much benefit from them. It may seem very hard at first when you readEmerson or Milton or Plato, or some of the great saints, but after a while youwill find yourself thinking about what they have written. You will feel you havegained something, because all those sages received their wisdom from theinfinite treasure-house of God—ideas that otherwise might not occur to you in alifetime.However, many people read constantly and yet cannot tell you what they haveread. The best way to read a book is to introspect about it. See how it appliesto your own life. And learn to discriminate. Do not accept blindly everythingthat you read; it should meet the tests of your mind. To be worthwhile, booksshould cause you to think. If they do that, you will find that your mind isdeveloping.Receive Knowledge Directly From SpiritPeople who do not read or meditate, who live only externally, do not develop anydeep understanding. Meditation keeps you directly in tune with the Power thatevokes all thought. To touch that Supreme Power is meditation. As a human beingyou do injustice to yourself if you don’t read; but to meditate is still better.I would like to read, but I can scarcely finish two pages before I am called toattend to something else, so I have given up reading. I find it more profitableto meditate. As I go deep within, radiant lights appear and great joy comes, joythat remains with me all day long. Such is my experience. Such is the experienceof all who commune with the ever blissful Lord.Don’t waste your time. God wants you to be a balanced individual. If you allowyour life to become unbalanced you will be punished by the cosmic law. Livesimply, have daily physical exercise, study rewarding books, and cultivate thehabit of daily meditation. If you meditate you will find much more happinessthan you have ever known. All knowledge will be given to you from within.My life has been that way. I have not read twenty books since I came to Americatwenty years ago. I am not proud of the fact; I would have been wholly ignorantif I hadn’t had, through meditation, the consciousness of Spirit. When I look ata book I see that whatever truth it contains has already been given to me fromGod. All thought and truth come from Spirit; if you commune with Him you receiveHis wisdom direct. So, read good books rather than waste time on unproductiveactivities; but better still, meditate and anchor your mind on the ultimateTruth, which is God.Man’s Evolution Ordained by Cosmic LawIn different ages and places, man has developed, by his thought processes,various ideas about life and the soul. For instance, when members of someprimitive tribes have headaches, they think their soul is lost, and they appealto the medicine man for healing. He goes out in the woods looking for the lostsoul, which he brings back in a box. Then he “replaces” the “soul” in thepatient’s head, and the headache is supposed to go away. It is the custom inanother culture, when anyone is sick, to put fishhooks into his flesh so that ifhe happens to sneeze, his soul will not escape but will be caught by the hooks.As through the process of faulty thought some people have arrived at erroneousconclusions about the soul, so by true reasoning others have come to a moreprofound understanding. We know that the soul is not a puff of breath, becausethere are persons who have lived long in the suspended-animation state withoutbreathing at all, showing that the soul cannot be bound by breath.3[part0057.html#footnote-324] The soul is something beyond breath or any otherphysical condition.Whether or not one believes in himself as a soul, he is bound by the cosmic lawto develop, consciously or unconsciously, his deeper nature. Whatever a person’soccupation in life, his consciousness is evolving whenever he is planningsomething or otherwise using his intelligence creatively. Man evolves throughevery constructive action he performs.The trouble with most people is that when they are performing an action they arethinking about something else. They don’t know how to concentrate on what theyare doing when they are doing it. You should learn to think of one thing at atime with all the power of your mind. Your whole attention should be there.Don’t drag along. Doing things in a lackadaisical way leads to failure andmisery.Man should not be a psychological automaton, like the animal, which acts onlythrough instinct. To be unthinking is a great sin against Spirit, which abidesin you; we are meant to be conscious of what we do. We should reflect before weact. We should learn how to use our minds so that we can evolve and realize ouroneness with the Creator. Everything we do should be the result of premeditatedthought.Aim for high goals. It is a waste to use the power of thought to obtain thingsthat are not important. Learn to remove the weeds that have grown in the gardenof the mind. Make your mental garden so beautiful that God will come there. Ifyou want to have such a mental garden, blooming in the soil of wisdom, you mustmake your life simple. By doing everything consciously, not absentmindedly, youcan analyze your activities; then choose what is important and cut out thenonessentials. As soon as you are through with your duties, withdraw your mindfrom them and employ it in other creative pursuits.God Fulfills Man’s Eternal QuestLearn how to cultivate the consciousness of Spirit. That is why you were born ahuman being. You were created under the evolutionary law that you might exerciseyour divine powers to find God. The animal can’t find Him. Lahiri Mahasaya wasworking on the science of helping animals to evolve more quickly; but he didn’tlive to finish this work. I, also, know of some ways to quicken the evolution ofthe lower forms of life. But what of the millions of human beings who are livinglike animals? When they leave this world they haven’t fulfilled the purpose oftheir existence. Why not fulfill it now? You can if you concentrate. The onlymeaning of life is to find the all-loving God, who has kept us apart fromHimself by shyly hiding from us. We must find Him. Mankind is engaged in aneternal quest for that “something else” he hopes will bring him happiness,complete and unending. For those individual souls who have sought and found God,the search is over: He is that Something Else.Nature Veils God’s PresenceWhy was temptation given to man? That he might look for the One who is moretempting than any worldly temptation. The earthly lures that surround you arenot intended to ensnare you, but to cause you to seek beyond them; to make youask, “Who created all these things? Who made me? Who am I? Where are You, Lord?Why are You hiding? Talk to me!” When you directly approach God with thesequestions, He answers. Most people don’t call deeply enough to Him, and so theynever find Him. You must speak clearly to Him in the language of your soul:“Lord, I want no longer to see only the beauty You have created. I want tobehold Your Face, which is more beautiful than the flowers, more entrancing thanall other faces. I want to see Who is behind all nature.” Even if a personcovers himself with a veil you can see that someone is there. So is nature likea great veil bulging with God’s presence. He is hiding there, but you take justa casual look, not penetrating to see the shy Indweller. As I sit breathless,silent, watchful in meditation, I become aware of a blissful trembling stirwithin me, and He whispers: “I am here.”The intelligence God has given us is the gateway to Heaven. It is the outer doorto His kingdom, but you don’t use it. Why not use it now, today? Don’t wait,only to leave the earth like a dog, kicked out by death. It is a crime againstyour soul. Your intelligence was given to you to discover why you were placedhere: to find Him.How to Discover SpiritThere are various techniques for discovering the Spirit. Silence is one of them.Practicing silence means to silence all desires that try to percolate into yourconsciousness from outside, so you can go deeper within to feel your soul.Another step or technique is devotion, or speaking to God purely and simply:“You have created me. I didn’t want to be created. It is Your responsibility toreveal Yourself to me.” Talking to Him a little while and then forgetting willnever bring His response. God is “hard to get” because not everyone “meansbusiness” with Him. The technique of prayer is usually ineffectual because mostprayers are not deep or devotional enough. You have to repeat and repeat untilyou go really deep, into the superconsciousness. Prayer in which your very soulis burning with desire for God is the only effectual prayer. You have prayedlike that at some time, no doubt; perhaps when you wanted something very badly,or urgently needed money—then you burned up the ether with your desire. That ishow you must feel for God. Talk to Him day and night; you will see that He willrespond.Yoga Is the Science of Finding GodThe Yoga system of contacting God is the best. It consists of variousscientifically effective techniques of meditation. The great sages of Indiareasoned that logically there must be an exact law by which to approach God,just as there are exact laws by which He operates His universes. Through theirexperiments, the spiritual laws of yoga were discovered. The science of yogawill take hold in this country more than any other form of spiritual seeking.The entire trend will be away from churches, where people go only to hear asermon, and into schools and quiet places where they will go to meditate andreally find God.Everyone should practice divine communion with God. This is what Jesus did whenhe was with his disciples. I am not here just to tell you about the sugar ofGod’s presence; my greatest aim is to make sure you taste it. What is the use ofmy talking about God unless you know Him and taste His sweetness? You mustrealize God, as I have realized Him.It is not out of pride that I speak this way, but because I am sent here totestify to you about Him. Day and night I think about my Lord. I am not wastingmy time. Everything I do I am doing only for Him, so engrossed that I don’tnotice the passage of time or feel fatigue from my daily activities. I feel Hispresence when I work. That is also my meditation. I often give thisillustration: Some worldly men remain drunk for years by hiding now and then totake a little drink to sustain the euphoric feeling; then they go back to theirwork. So is the divine man; he hides from people and meditates upon the Lord.Drinking deep of the intoxicating wine of God’s presence, he whispers, “Lord,You are so wonderful, so marvelous! I love You.” Then he goes back to hisduties. Inwardly he talks to God all the time, no matter what he is doing.I am never separated from Him for a second. That is the state I wanted andworked for. I remember that once in a while I used to feel that He had gone awayfrom me, and at such times I wanted to die rather than live without Him. Ididn’t find happiness in anything. Thus does the lover of God suffer whenseparated from Him. But a time comes when the devotee beholds the Lord dancingeverywhere, and feels the immortal fountain of His spirit and His bliss everbubbling in his soul. This is what you will feel if you meditate. Pray with suchintensity that He will come to you. In the Gita is a beautiful promise from theLord: “Immerse thy mind in Me alone; concentrate on Me thy discriminativeperception; and beyond doubt thou shalt dwell immortally in Me.”4[part0057.html#footnote-323]The yoga techniques are more scientific than prayer; that is why they lead moreswiftly to divine communion. In my youth, when I sought Him with prayer alone,it often took a long time to get results. After I had learned Kriya Yoga andpracticed it, with deep devotion, I achieved results in a few minutes. Krishnataught that yoga meditation is greater than the path of asceticism, the path ofdevotion or prayer, the path of right action, or the path of discrimination.5[part0057.html#footnote-322] It is a faster way. An airplane will take you fromLos Angeles to New York in a matter of hours; by bullock cart the journey wouldlast several months. If you practice yoga, you will find it to be the airplaneof spiritual progress.After you have perfected yourself in the Yoga path, which embraces bodilydiscipline, mental discipline, and spiritual discipline, the obstacles tospiritual success are overcome and you can commune freely with God. That is whyit is the highest path. And that is why I am trying to acquaint people with it.Yoga is not a myth, a creation of someone’s imagination. It is a true science.Why shouldn’t you take from India the greatest methods for finding God that haveever been given to mankind? I went to the masters in India for training, andthey taught me about Christ in a profound and loving way such as never I heardin the West. I saw Christ in their company. They talked with him. Did St.Francis lie to us? He saw Christ every night. Lord Jesus lives! I have seen him.When you are behind a screen you see everyone else outside, but they can’t seeyou. So the saints and the angels can see you, but you can’t see them unless youpractice yoga.6 [part0057.html#footnote-321]Your Prayer Must Be Intense to Reach GodLast summer I stopped at a monastery where I met one of the priests. He was awonderful soul. I asked him how long he had been on the spiritual path as amonk.“About twenty-five years,” he replied. Then I asked:“Do you see Christ?”“I don’t deserve it,” he answered. “Maybe after death he will visit me.”“No,” I assured him, “you can see him from tonight if you make up your mind.”Tears were in his eyes, and he remained silent.You must pray intensely. If you sit night after night practicing meditation andcrying to God, the darkness will be burned up, and you will see the Light behindthis physical light, the Life behind all life, the Father behind all fathers,the Mother behind all mothers, the Friend behind all friends, the Element behindall elements, the Power behind all powers. That is where I live, and where Iwant you to come.Practice of Yoga Awakens Soul LongingYou have gone away from God like the prodigal son, and it is only by returningto Him, within, that you will make this vale of tears a haven of heaven. Thereis no other way. If everyone in this world were a millionaire there would stillbe troubles and sorrows, for you cannot buy unshakable happiness. That comesonly by following a technique of yoga, and by devotion, by going within.Practicing yoga is half the battle. Even if you don’t feel enthusiastic in thebeginning, if you go on practicing you will come to feel that tremendous longingfor God which is necessary if you are to find Him.Why don’t you make the effort? Whence do all the beautiful things in creationcontinually emerge? Whence comes the intelligence of great souls, but from thestorehouse of the Infinite Spirit? And if these wonders you see about you arenot enough to induce you to seek Him, why should He reveal Himself to you? Hehas given you the capacity for love that you may yearn for Him above all else.Don’t misuse your love and reason. And don’t misuse your concentration andintelligence on false goals.This World Is Only Pictures of LightNight is the time for meditation; never go to bed until you have communion. Inever do. Last night as I sat on my bed His presence engulfed me. The whole roomand everything in it was blinding Light. Even when I slept I remained locked inthe arms of the Divine. Never have I felt such joy.This world is all a motion-picture projection of God’s mind. There is no death,no disease, no wickedness. Someday, when He will show you His Light transformingitself into this terrible cosmic motion picture of life and death, and thenwithdraw the picture so that only His Light remains, you can laugh at theunreality of His light-and-shadow creation. You will know then that He hascreated everything out of His Light; and that only the Light is real. We mustfully shake ourselves out of this dream delusion to realize that we are rays ofthat immortal Light. This realization comes with the practice of the highestyoga technique of meditation. It cannot be conveyed in lectures.God Is Our Only True GoalEvery now and then I receive a letter from the Self-Realization students inLondon. During these terrible air raids they have not missed oneSelf-Realization Fellowship service. That is the real spirit of England and thatis the spirit that will save England. Politicians can never save the world; itis only understanding God that will save the world. He is our true goal in thislife. Otherwise there would be no incentive for going on.Those who love God should worship Him in all religions. “In whatever way peopleare devoted to Me, in that measure (according to their desire, their degree ofunderstanding, and their manner of worship) I manifest Myself to them. All men,regardless of their mode of seeking, pursue a path to Me.”7[part0057.html#footnote-320] Criticize no one’s faith. There should be a genuinefeeling of love and respect for all. Wherever you see a temple or church youshould inwardly bow down to the Spirit there. It is not for everyone to be ateacher, but you can always draw the attention of others to spiritual things.Don’t waste your time, spending hours listening to the radio and reading uselessnovels. Be entertained by the divine messages coming from your own soul. Just bya gentle attuning touch of my love, I hear His program here in my heart.No one can bring you salvation unless you earn it—not through belief, notthrough following dogma, but by your own knowledge and experience. You shouldask yourself these questions every day: If there is a God, why don’t I see Him?If there are saints, where are they? The answers will be given you; you cancommune with God and His saints if you practice the science of Kriya Yoga. Mysole desire is to give you the Truth, that you may experience what I experience.The purpose of this life is to find your Self. Know your Self. Feel the throb ofthe ocean of God’s presence in your heart. Suppose you are floating in theocean, rocked on the bosom of its mighty vastness, and when you swim ashore, youstill feel the whole ocean, surging behind you as you walk onto the beach—thisis the way I feel God. He never leaves any of His children for a moment. He willreply to all your questions, and then there will be no more fears.Find that Power, feel the ocean of His love behind your consciousness, and youwill achieve the greatest success man can attain.[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0057.html#footnote-326-backlink] Colorful gardens surrounded the firstSelf-Realization Fellowship Golden Lotus Temple in Encinitas.2 [part0057.html#footnote-325-backlink] Through the “single eye” within thecenter of the forehead, man can behold the inner astral and causal worlds behindthe gross physical cosmos.3 [part0057.html#footnote-324-backlink] See feat of Sadhu Haridas[part0036.html#_idTextAnchor043].4 [part0057.html#footnote-323-backlink] Bhagavad Gita XII:8.5 [part0057.html#footnote-322-backlink] Bhagavad Gita VI:46.6 [part0057.html#footnote-321-backlink] There have been mystics of variousfaiths who, through their transcendent powers of devotion to God, have attainedto the breathless state of superconsciousness ecstasy that alone brings trueinner vision.

Heredity, and national, social, and familycharacteristics, tastes, and habits mold each human life. But in the beginningof life, children are about the same everywhere. Jesus said: “Suffer littlechildren to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom ofGod.”1 [part0058.html#footnote-329] Divinity is the one nationality of allchildren the world over; but as they grow older, and family and socialcharacteristics begin to exercise their influence, children begin to manifestnational and racial traits.God has expressed His truth in varying combinations within particularcivilizations, nationalities, and individual mentalities. Through this diversityHe has placed before us a kaleidoscopic image of man’s potential. It is man’sduty to glean from this variety the qualities that are highest and best; and tofoster them within himself, his nation, and the world. Great men and saints dothis. They live several hundred years ahead of their time in exemplifyinguniversal principles of truth that are eternal. These principles are the essenceof the true art of living, and are applicable and vital to the success andhappiness of all men. The differences among peoples of the various nations,races, and creeds should create, not a division, but a basis of comparison forselection of the best qualities and methods with which to develop the ideal manand the ideal world.Of all the nations at present, India and America represent, respectively, theacme of spiritually and materially efficient civilizations. India and otherOriental nations have produced the highest types of spiritual people, such asJesus and Gandhi; whereas America has produced the greatest types of businessmenand practical scientists, such as Henry Ford and Thomas Edison. A combination ofspiritually efficient qualities with materially efficient qualities, asrepresented in the foregoing life-examples of great men, can offer us an art ofliving that will produce in every nationality all-round men of the highesttype—physically, mentally, morally, materially, socially, and spiritually.It is important to select, not one-sided national characteristics, but all-rounduniversal principles of living from all nations and from all great men. Do nottake only those principles that develop the physical at the cost of thespiritual phase of man’s life, or vice versa; adopt those principles thatdevelop equally and harmoniously the superman of balanced physical, mental,moral, and spiritual qualities.Practical Methods for Uniform DevelopmentFollowing are a few practical methods for uniformly developing body, mind, andsoul:• Include in your daily diet milk and other dairy products, and a goodpercentage of raw food and fresh fruits; drink a large glass of orange juicewith finely ground nuts mixed in. Eat less meat; avoid beef and pork entirely.Read and follow a reliable modern book on dietetics.• Fast one day a week on orange juice and use a suitable natural laxative asprescribed by your physician.• Every morning and evening, with deep attention, walk briskly, run, or takesome other form of exercise—as vigorous as your constitution allows—until youperspire.• Read and meditate on some inspiring passage from the Bible and from theBhagavad Gita.• Read Shakespeare and other classics, and suitable portions from practicalbooks on such subjects as chemistry, physics, physiology, history of Orientaland Western philosophy, comparative religion, ethics, and psychology. Don’twaste your time on cheap writings. Read a dependable health periodical and aninspiring spiritual magazine. Include editorials and health articles whenreading newspapers, not just the comics and scandals.• Visit different temples and churches—Protestant, Catholic, Buddhist, Jewish,Hindu, and so on—to develop your appreciation and understanding of all faiths.Look upon each one as The Temple of Our God.• Honor God not only in man-made temples, but learn to worship and commune withHim in the inner temple of silence. Practice meditation for one hour in themorning and one hour at night, following the scientific methods taught by thegreat masters of Self-Realization Fellowship. Do not be sidetracked into forestsof blind, untested belief and theology; get on the one highway ofSelf-realization that leads quickly to God.• Do not be enslaved by the senses. They are not meant to bind you with materialdesires, but to serve you with perceptions of good, which reflect God.• See plays or motion pictures only occasionally, choosing those of the highestquality.• Obey God’s divine laws as applied to family, country, and all nations.• Speak truth with kindness and understanding, and respect truth wherever youperceive it.• Expand your love for family and country to include love and service to peopleof all nations. See God in all men of whatever race or religion.• Spend less, and have more, by doing away with luxurious habits. From yourearnings put aside as much as possible, so that you can live partially on theinterest from your savings, without having to dip into the capital.• See life as divided into four periods, during each of which the main focusshould be on developing efficiency in the activities appropriate to that part oflife.2 [part0058.html#footnote-328](1) From age 5 to 25 years.

As he grows intoadulthood, he should get a general education, learn efficiency by study andobservation, and seek specialized training in some work to which he feelssuited.(2) From age 25 to 40 years. As an adult, one should fulfill family and otherobligations to this world, while striving to keep a spiritual balance.(3) From age 40 to 50 years. During this period, adults should live morequietly, studying inspirational writings and keeping abreast of progress in thearts and sciences, and spending more time in meditation.(4) From age 50 on.

Exercise, read,meditate, love God, and act peacefully at all times. Learn to be calmly activeand actively calm, carrying into your daily activities the calmness gained inthe spiritual activity of meditation.

This mental evenness istermed yoga.”3 [part0058.html#footnote-327]Please join me in this prayer for true brotherhood under the Fatherhood of God:“Heavenly Father, help us to create a ‘United States of the World,’ with ThyTruth our leader and president, which will guide us to live in lovingbrotherhood, and urge us to develop our bodies, minds, and souls perfectly, thatThy Kingdom of Heavenly Peace, which is within us, may be manifest in theactions of our daily life.“Make us healthy, efficient, perfect in every way, so that we may inspire allour earthly brothers to manifest their true nature as Thy noble children.“Heavenly Father, may Thy love shine forever on the sanctuary of our devotion,and may we be able to awaken Thy love in all hearts.”If you contact and commune with God in the inner temple of silence, you willhave mastered the true art of living.

(1) Physical, mental, moral, and spiritual education of the celibatestudent (Brahmacharya). (2) Fulfillment of householder or worldlyresponsibilities (Grihastha). (3) Retirement from the world to seclusion or anashram to devote more time to spiritual pursuits and thinking of God(Vanaprastha). (4) Complete outer as well as inner renunciation of all ties tothe world (Sannyas). Though complete renunciation was generally the fourthashrama, it was not confined to that stage, but was advocated earlier in lifefor one who felt the supreme desire for God alone.By following the four ashramas, man was taught the art of living and rightbehavior; given an opportunity to fulfill his material ambitions andresponsibilities; allowed a time to contemplate his spiritual life and make agreater effort for Self-realization; and then encouraged to give his life, hisall, back to God, from whom all gifts of life, and life itself, have come.3 [part0058.html#footnote-327-backlink] Bhagavad Gita II:48."},{"pageContent":"Habit—Your Master or Your Slave?Date and place unknownThe human brain, with its hilly ranges of cerebral convolutions inlaid witharterial streamlets and dark rivers of veins, presents an epitome of a hugeestate. Is this exquisite territory devoid of a Divine Resident? Could there bea book without an author, a child without parents, a clock without a maker, arose without a designer? Nay! Similarly, the cerebral domain of mystic beautyhas been shaped by wondrous intelligent agencies.Who lives in this marvelous hall whose walls of mortared osseous tissues arefitted with ocular, tactual, auditory, olfactory, and gustatory doors? Beneaththe dome of the human skull a colony of myriads of cells pulsating with life andintelligence are playing out scenes of intense activity. Tiny brain cells areengaged in diverse pursuits—banqueting, introspecting, and receiving guests ofsensations that enter from the outer sensory doors. There is buying and sellinggoing on: processes of absorption and elimination. Like tiny boats, bloodcorpuscles paddle along arterial streams, laden with various vital commodities.Guiding and controlling many of these cellular activities is an unseen band ofimpish pixies and good fairies—habits. Sometimes great mischief is created whenforeign and lawless habits are permitted entry into the cranial commonwealth.They set themselves up as lords, dominating the activities of their hosts, thebrain cells. When the latter attempt to resist this encroachment on theirfreedom, these United States of Flesh become a scene of civil war. The wholebodily country is thrown into disorder while the brain cells furiously debatethe right of certain habits to act as petty dictators.How do habits gain power to tyrannize over human conduct? Every human activity,whether it be performed as an outward physical movement or as an inner processof thought, is a vote for a particular habit. Repetition of that action orthought swells the number of votes in favor of electing that habit to a seat inthe bodily government. A considerable number of such actions vote that habitinto office. At different periods of life a collective vote of all previoushuman actions determines which habits are going to predominate and rule supreme.An election by numerical superiority alone, without adherence to a desirablequalitative standard, may bring disaster upon a country. If the majority ofvoters are morons or criminals, they are bound to blunder and elect the wrongpresident. Similarly, unless the votes of human actions are cast according tothe supreme law of discrimination, the brain cells may thoughtlessly enslavethemselves under tyrannical habit-dictators.Maintenance of a truly enlightened spiritual democracy in the bodily countryrequires a thorough education of the brain-cell citizenry. The latter should betrained not to permit habit-candidates to be elected merely on the numericalstrength of thoughtlessly repeated actions, but should consciously exercise thequalitative power of discriminative attention with the casting of everyaction-vote. They should be guided by ideal rationalism, and heed its warningsagainst accepting the bribe of sentimental attachment to environment, whichleads to the misuse of voting power. Discriminative reason should be the soleguide in selection of the presidential habit-candidates.Are Habit Slaves Born or Made?Habits of drinking, excessive smoking, overindulgence in coffee or tea; andhabitual moods of anger, greed, envy, sloth, and despondency are usually electedto office by the cumulative numerical strength of unwise hordes of littleactions performed without any thought of the aftereffect of enslavement. Personsaddicted to such habits are not born ineluctably to their unfortunate fate; inthis or in a past life, knowingly or unknowingly, they have enslaved themselvesthrough constant repetition of certain actions. The first drink never made adrunkard; the first act of sensuality never made a libertine; the first use ofnarcotics never made a dope addict. It was a series of mechanical orill-considered repetitions of such misguided actions that elected these grippinghabits to power.1 [part0059.html#footnote-333] Quantitative strength won againstthe qualitative voice of attentive reason, which had become weakened throughfailure to exercise its powers, and had thus lost its vote.Guard yourself, therefore, against the first performance of a wrong act. Whatyou do once you are likely to do again. It is by repetition that a habit growsstronger and bigger, like a rolling snowball. Use your reason in all youractions; otherwise you may thoughtlessly convert yourself into a helpless slaveof undesirable habits.Impeach a Bad Habit-President and Install a Good OneA strong bad habit presiding for a long time over the bodily country bringschaos and misery. Spiritual famine, mental fevers, and a universal poverty ofbody and mind exist in that misruled land. A strong bad habit should beimpeached before a tribunal of daily introspection under the presiding judge ofconscience, who should inform the court of reason that the inevitable outcome ofpersistence in the offending actions will be an impaired nervous system, wastedpowers, and vanished happiness. This constantly sounded note of warning mayserve gradually to persuade the jury of reason to the decision to put awayforever the guilty victimizing habit.Sometimes it is difficult to convince the court. Many persons who excessivelysmoke, drink, or indulge in sex experiences do not seek or even wish to be freeof these slavish compulsions. They delusively think that there is nothingharmful about what they are doing because they don’t immediately sufferdisillusioning painful consequences. Childlike, they fail to visualize theultimate results of their actions. They do not see that they have set intomotion laws that work impartially for good or ill, according to the nature ofhuman actions; that, although the shovels of harmful habits dig slowly, they yetdig surely a yawning, untimely grave, a pit of misery toward which the slave ofwrong habits proceeds through scorching flames of suffering. Of such entrappedpersons the Gita says: “Harboring bewildering thoughts, caught in the net ofdelusion, craving only sensual delights, they sink into a foul hell.”2[part0059.html#footnote-332]First convince your mind that you are going to overthrow the tyranny of theundesirable ruling habit; then begin the work of constitutional agitation andactual impeachment. A whining or sorrowing attitude, gentle remonstrance, oreven violent but spasmodic rebellion is of little avail. It is throughcontinuous repetition of certain actions that you are the maker of your habits;and you must undo hurtful ones by a similarly regular effort, implemented byconscious exercise of will and the discriminative power of reason.Relate your actions to new and better habits. Keep them continuously busy,interested, and attentive in serving good habits and in fraternizing with othergood actions. If your actions begin to revert to their old dangeroushabit-influenced associations, don’t become discouraged. Persist in rightactions, give them sufficient time and attention, and the voting strength of thenew good actions will increase and finally become powerful enough to overthrowthe worthless habit and to elect in its place a worthy one.It Takes Time to Establish Habits, Good or BadIt takes time for even a bad habit to attain supremacy, so why be impatientabout the growth of a rival good habit? Do not despair about your undesirablehabits; simply stop feeding them and thus making them strong by repetition. Thetime that elapses in the formation of habits varies with individual nervoussystems and brains and is chiefly determined by the quality of one’s attention.Through the power of deep, concentration-trained attention, any habit may beinstalled—that is, new patterns may be made in the brain—almost instantaneouslyand at will. The potency of concentration and will to create good and badfortune is strikingly summed up in the Biblical verse: “For whosoever hath, tohim shall be given, and he shall have more abundance; but whosoever hath not,from him shall be taken away even that he hath.”3 [part0059.html#footnote-331]This truth is particularly applicable to habits. A man of good actionsstrengthens his will to perform further good actions, and thus increases invirtue with little effort. But a slave of bad habits debauches his will andreason, so that eventually he is not only powerless to create new good habits,but also has weakened his hold on whatever good habits he may have had at thestart.Government of one’s actions by intuitional, wisdom-guided discrimination,uninfluenced by either good or bad habits, imparts unbounded power of will. “Butthat man succeeds supremely, O Arjuna, who, disciplining the senses by the mind,unattached, keeps his organs of activity steadfast on the path of God-unitingactions.”4 [part0059.html#footnote-330] A man with such power can instantly fixa new habit in his brain, or stop one at will. An ideal democracy presupposesrational, willing obedience to good laws, without any goading by higherauthority or other external influences. Similarly a wise man, one who is reallyfree, avoids error and performs good, not from the compulsion of habit but fromfree and reasoned choice. Such a one does not permit himself to be dominated byeven a good habit, lest in so doing he fail to exercise full discriminativechoice of action. A good habit may be in force simply because there has neverbeen any temptation of evil to overthrow it. A good habit thus established isnot necessarily fixed permanently in the nature, because it has been maintainednot from discriminative choice and reason but as a result of favoringcircumstance.All national tastes and human customs are habits, circumstantially acquired as aresult of environmental influence. Love of Americanism or of Hinduism is theoutcome of habit and familiarity. If I had had the choice, I would havepreferred to be a human “chameleon,” free to embrace the desirable aspects ofall nationalities and all creeds.We can test our power over our habits by commanding the mind to like or dislikea certain food at will. On one occasion I found this particular test useful:Shortly after I had come to America, I attended a dinner at which Roquefortcheese and crackers were served. No sooner had Mr. Roquefort touched the palate,and no sooner had his arrival become known to the cerebral cells, than thehabit-lords of taste instituted a rebellion among the honored guests alreadygathered in my stomach, who became very upset and began to threaten, “If you letMr. Roquefort in, we will all leave in a body!” I did not enjoy this suddenembarrassment! Noticing that everyone else at the table was greatly relishingthe peculiar food, I strongly urged my senses to elect immediately the Roquefortcheese-enjoying habit. Then I liked the taste at once, and have continued tolike it from that time on.Why is it that you sometimes find yourself acting, or reacting, contrary to yourreal desires? Because over a period of time you have built up habits that arecontrary to those desires, and your actions automatically flatter your habits.You must first establish habits that will influence your actions to cater toyour true ideals.Habit is an automatic mechanism for performing actions without expending themental and physical labor ordinarily involved in performing actions that are newto us. Wrongly used, this mechanism is an archenemy, threatening man’s citadelof free choice. Be practical. Try from today to overcome inimical habits hiddenwithin you, garbed as environmental likes and dislikes. Oust them and be free toact from reason alone. Your habits are not you. Shake off that delusion and youwill remember your true Self, the perfect image of God within you.[../images/00011.jpeg]1 [part0059.html#footnote-333-backlink] For people who have established inprevious lives the pattern of a harmful habit, such as alcoholism, the “firstdrink” was taken many lives ago; that is why in this life even the first drinkcan revive that habit with alarming suddenness and often tragic consequences.2 [part0059.html#footnote-332-backlink] Bhagavad Gita XVI:16.3 [part0059.html#footnote-331-backlink] Matthew 13:12.4 [part0059.html#footnote-330-backlink] Bhagavad Gita III:7.

Sometimes He grants a wishimmediately. When I asked if the rain might be stopped for the services today,the Voice of the Divine Mother said: “There will be a little sunshine.” It isbecause of the kindness of the Holy Spirit that we have sunshine this morning.The Lord is the Mother of all mothers, the Father of all fathers, the One Friendbehind all friends. If you always think of Him as the nearest of the near, youwill witness many wonders in your life. “He walks with me and He talks with meand He tells me I am His own.”1 [part0060.html#footnote-340] And God will talkwith you, also, if by meditation you make definite inroads “with unperturbèdpace” into the divine realm.The poet Francis Thompson spoke of God as the “Hound of Heaven”: God is depictedas pursuing man, rather than as being sought by him. Man, hiding in labyrinthinecaves of doubts, escapes from God; still the Divine Hound keeps coming, andwarning: “All things betray thee, who betrayest Me.”If you so live that you drive God away, you drive love itself away from you. Ineverything we are seeking—money and sense pleasures—we are actually seeking God.We are searchers for diamonds who pick up instead little pieces of glass shiningwith the sunlight. Momentarily blinded by their attractiveness, we forget tokeep on looking for the real diamonds, which are much harder to find.Although more difficult to obtain, your good habits are the diamonds that willgive you true and lasting pleasure. And bad habits are the pieces of mere glassthat seem to satisfy you, because they are more easily come by; but which, beingdelusory, will in the end bring disappointment. Satiety will overtake you, sothat nothing gives you pleasure. I do not have to go through those experiences;I can see the end of human pleasures, and I have found in God the only real andlasting joy.The real definition of “old age” is that state wherein one has become bored withthe world. I tired of the pleasures of life very quickly;2[part0060.html#footnote-339] and this world would have been extremely boresometo me had I not sought and found the joy of God. The happiness and abundance Ifind in Him are measureless. Eternity is not long enough for me to explain thejoy of the devotee’s heart when God enters. This is not exaggeration, becauseGod’s joy is eternal—unceasing, ever new, boundless. All of us have glimpses ofit now and then—soul recollections of a state of eternal happiness.In this world everybody wants to use us for his own purpose. Only God—and a realmaster who knows God—can truly love us. The ordinary human being does not knowwhat love is. When someone’s company gives you pleasure, you tend to think youlove that person. But in reality it is yourself you love; your ego has beenpleased by the other person’s attention, that is all. Would you go on “loving”that person if he should cease to please you? What it means to love someone elsemore than oneself is very difficult to understand, and even more difficult forthe average person to practice. To illustrate, I will tell you a true story ofreal love.There was in India a devoted husband who loved his wife very deeply. Another manbecame infatuated with her. She ran away with her lover, who eventually left herwithout friends or funds. One day her husband came to see her. He spoke gently.“Are you through with this experience? Come home with me, if you are.”She demurred. “I could not think of disgracing you further.”“What do I care about the opinion of society?” he replied. “I love you. Theother man loved only your body. I love the real you—your soul. What has happeneddoesn’t make any difference.”That was real love. The husband wasn’t concerned for his honor; he was thinkingonly of the welfare of his beloved.One great stumbling-block in the way of giving true love is our habits. In ourhearts we all want to be angels, but our habits make us devils. In the morningwe make up our minds to adhere to good, but during the day we forget ourresolution. “The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”3[part0060.html#footnote-338] Flesh means habits. Our spirit, our wisdom, iswilling; but our good habits are weak. The Gita says, “The eager excitablesenses do forcibly seize the consciousness even of one who has a high degree ofenlightenment, and is striving (for liberation).”4 [part0060.html#footnote-337]Many people don’t understand the terrible nature of habit. Some persons formhabits very quickly. This is all right when establishing good habits; but it isdangerous when performing actions that may create bad habits. If you give such aperson one cigarette, he may become a habitual smoker. Or a taste of one drinkmay make him a lifelong drinker.5 [part0060.html#footnote-336]Since you do not know what type of subconscious mind you have, or what yourhidden tendencies may be, it is best to avoid actions that may lead to harmfulhabits. If the mind is not strong in wisdom and discrimination, it acts like ablotting paper, absorbing bad habits quickly.So many people need help in this world! And God does help them, through thosewho are willing instruments of His love. The other day a pitiable case came tome. This person, when not drinking, is a good man; but as soon as he startsdrinking he becomes a fiend. He would go to extremes to do good when he issober; but when drunk he beats his wife and causes terror. He has come forhealing, and I know that if he tunes in just a little bit he will be helped. Butsee how terrible evil habits are! When this man is not under the influence ofliquor, you wouldn’t be able to see a trace of evil in him; and at such times heis so filled with remorse about his evil habit of drinking that he wants todestroy himself. But still he drinks! That is what habit does.If you make up your mind to do something good you must do it. Don’t let anythingstand in your way. But before you make a resolution, determine that it is a goodone. When I make up my mind I absolutely do not listen to any contradictions. Isometimes take a long time to make my decision, but when I do, nothing can stopme. A law of God operates for you when you strongly make up your mind and thenadhere firmly to that resolution.All of us mean well; but habits sometimes make us do things, against our will,that are harmful to others and to ourselves. Therefore, make up your mind not tobe imposed upon by bad habits.Why Let Your Habits Dictate to You?Your forefathers came here to escape from rules that took away freedom to actaccording to one’s conscience. Freeborn Americans don’t like to have anyonedictate to them. Why then should you let yourself be dictated to by your habits?Such as when you don’t want to eat, and still you eat; or when you don’t want tofight with others, yet you do. What is the matter? You have allowed yourself tobecome a slave to bad habits.Just being born in America or in other democratic lands does not guaranteefreedom of the mind and heart. To be free is to be able to perform right actionsaccording to the dictates of one’s own soul wisdom, not out of compulsion ofhabit, or blind obedience, or unreasoning fear. Wisdom confers true freedom, andthat is the real spirit of America.Doing whatever you please is not freedom; it is an abuse of freedom. Suppose youlive in a house with twenty other people, each of whom regards freedom as theright to do what he pleases, and each of whom wants to do something thatconflicts with the desires of the others? There can be no real freedom undersuch circumstances. Freedom comes only by following the law of self-government.To do freely what you ought to do, when you ought to do it—to be guided by yourwisdom—is the only real freedom.Slavery to habits is slavery in its worst form. Resolve to be free. Awaken thedivine memory of your soul’s freedom by affirming: “Even though I have had somebad habits since childhood, I can discard them by exercise of my wisdom andwill. I am master of my own body-house.”Be Guided by Wisdom, Not ConventionWhat makes one person act differently from another? Habits of living and doingand thinking; habits of environment and of nationality. In the latter case,habits are imposed upon us. I follow my own ways. When I started for America in1920, I had a long beard. You would think that men with beards would appear morevenerable; and in India beards are admired for this reason. But while stillaboard ship, I was persuaded that Americans, on seeing a man with a long beard,would be more inclined to remark, “There goes a wild man from the jungle!”After I understood that few American men wear a beard, I was willing to abandonmine; but I resolved to keep my hair long, because my guru, Sri Yukteswarji,wore his hair long. So no one was able to influence me to cut my hair short. IfI were to cut off my long hair now, the same people who ridiculed its lengthyears ago would laugh at me for having short hair, and would feel that thestature of the inner man also had been shortened.We don’t really know what is right or real, because we are always comparingthings on the basis of outer appearances. Therefore we are often incorrect inour judgments. Who is able to say what is right and what is wrong, merely on abasis of appearances?You should make an effort gradually to free yourself from slavery to any habit,be it of dress or food or anything else. Many people feel they have to eat meatthree times a day. Others are convinced they should eat nothing but lettuce andnuts; that if they vary their diet they will become ill! Such beliefs are a formof slavery. You should not permit yourself to be bound by any habit of living;be able, rather, to change your habits as wisdom dictates. Learn to liverightly, using your power of free choice, guided by wisdom. Be able to sleepcomfortably on a soft bed one night and just as comfortably on the floor thenext night. That divine nonattachment to habit is the freedom advocated by themasters of India.True Freedom Versus Whim FreedomIn the West many people believe in freedom of a different kind—I call it whimfreedom. Because of a mistaken conception of the real nature of freedom, someparents make their children habit-slaves for life by indiscriminately giving into their desires. The child grows up thinking that so long as his desires aresatisfied he will be happy; and that the purpose of life is to satisfy desires.Later he realizes that he has been misled; the world outside is much differentfrom what he has seen at home. To satisfy every whim is not so easy in theworld! Others may push him around in order to gain their own ends; and he toobecomes callous in order to satisfy his whims and desires. “Believing thatfulfillment of bodily desires is man’s highest aim, confident that this world is‘all,’ such persons are engrossed till the moment of death in earthly cares andconcerns.”6 [part0060.html#footnote-335]Parents should try to equip their children with firm will and discrimination, sothat they can make their way in the world and still remain apart from its badhabits. Teach children how to be really free. Don’t let them become slaves tothe body and to undesirable habits. It is good to train a child in regularity ofdaily habits, but he should be trained also in evenmindedness: if he gets tosleep on time, all right; if not, all right. If he has his dinner on time, fine;if he cannot eat on time, fine. Children should be taught to respect the rightsof others; but to be free of habit slavery to anything or anyone.Fight Bad Habits With “Won’t” PowerWhen a mule wants to be agreeable, it is quite obedient, but when it makes upits mind to stop cooperating, nobody can move it. You should develop that kindof won’t power. Be master of your moods and habits. Then when you make up yourmind not to do something that is wrong, nobody can make you do it against yourwill. In other situations, however, should you find yourself to be mistaken, beable quickly to change your mind. This flexibility comes when you do not permityourself to be governed by habit, but act instead by wisdom-guided free will. Befree! Don’t be a slave even of good habits; do right for its own sake.Some people have to be told every day what to do, even though their duties maybe substantially the same; but ordinarily people perform routine dailyactivities as a matter of habit. This is fine if they have cultivated goodhabits; but it is unfortunate for those who have adopted bad habits. Most peoplepossess a combination of both.Habits Are Mental Phonograph RecordsRepeated performance of an action creates a mental blueprint. Every action isperformed mentally as well as physically, and repetition of a particular actionand its accompanying thought-pattern causes the formation of subtle electricalpathways in the physiological brain, somewhat like the grooves in a phonographrecord. After a time, whenever you put the needle of attention on those“grooves” of electrical pathways, it plays back the “record” of the originalmental blueprint. Each time an action is repeated, these grooves of electricalpathways become deeper, until the slightest attention automatically “plays”those same actions over and over again.Yet by concentration and will power you can erase even deep grooves oflong-standing habits. If you are addicted to smoking, for example, say toyourself: “The habit of smoking has long been lodged in my brain. Now I put allmy attention and concentration on my brain and I will that habit to bedislodged.” Command your mind thus, again and again. The best time of the day todo this is in the morning, when the will and attention are fresh. Repeatedlyaffirm your freedom, using all the strength of your will power. One day you willsuddenly feel that you no longer are ensnared by that habit.I know a man who wanted to get rid of the smoking habit. He was a chain smoker,but he had great faith that he could overcome the habit. I told him: “After Ihave given you a healing I want you to smoke. It will taste just like a bundleof rags and you will not enjoy smoking anymore.” And this was so. When he triedto smoke the next day he became nauseated. He had been receptive to my strongthought, and I had momentarily been able to transmit my consciousness to him.After that he was freed from this bad habit.Biting the nails is another foolish, useless habit. Why should you do suchthings against your will when you are the king of the castle of your life?Maintain Your Freedom as a Child of GodIf your mind is strong, and if you surrender yourself to God and forget thebody, you will be able to maintain your freedom as a child of God. Make up yourmind that no habit has a permanent hold on you. If your wisdom is strong, youcan convince yourself in a second what you should do. Awaken that wisdom whichrevives in you the power of free will, enabling you to rise above the compulsiveinstinct of ordinary habits. “Even if thou art the chief sinner among allsinners, yet by the sole raft of wisdom thou shalt safely cross the sea ofsin.”7 [part0060.html#footnote-334]The best way to get rid of habits is to will them out of your mind at once! Donot linger over them, lest your resolve weaken. Wisdom is your salvation fromhabits. If one tells a little boy not to eat candies, he will want them morethan ever. Suppose that when he grows up he has diabetes, and his doctor tellshim he will die if he eats more candy. It is wisdom then that tells him thedoctor is right, and that encourages him quickly to give up the candy habit ofmany years. Through wisdom man learns—sometimes!I remember in my school in Ranchi, India, a boy who liked to do just theopposite of what he was told to do. Therefore I often told him to do what Ididn’t want him to do, and in that way got him to do what I wanted. In time he“got wise,” in a double sense, and changed himself for the better.This is my message to all who suffer from slavery to habit: turn against thoseslave-driving habits that have been telling you what to do, and say, “I have awhip with which I will make you get out. You cannot make me do things against mywill any longer. I am a freeborn child of God. I am made in His image. I willuse my divinely bestowed wisdom and free will to do the right thing that Ishould do in everything.”Many times I have used the divine power of will to destroy a habit that wasseeking to get hold of me. When I have eaten certain foods and found myselfbecoming bound by a wish for them, I stopped eating those foods until the desirewas gone.When I went to Singapore I found there a certain fruit that is delicious; but Iwatched myself that I didn’t form a craving for it. I knew that if I did nottake care I could find myself wanting it morning, noon, and night. That is theway we enslave ourselves. So although I had full enjoyment of the fruit that oneday, I didn’t regret its absence on the next day. If we are watchful of thethings we enjoy, there is no need to fear. We should keep our freedom at allcosts.So many people go on eating foods that they know are not good for them. But if Isay I won’t eat a food, that is the end of it. Isn’t that freedom? to do things,not because your habits compel you, nor because your friends persuade you, butbecause your own wisdom tells you? With wisdom comes such power of convictionthat you don’t need habits to lean on to do the right thing you should do. Assoon as you are convinced of the wisdom of doing a thing, nothing should be ableto turn you away from doing it. But you have to be guided by wisdom. You caninstall habits at will by the power of wisdom. I can make myself like anythingthat wisdom demands.The mental habit-patterns of most people have become set, making it difficultfor them to change. Those who keep their minds pliable through discipline andself-control can easily change. The mind should be like putty. Wisdom keeps themind plastic. That is freedom. I want all mankind to enjoy that freedom fromhabits. When you have liberated yourself from habit slavery, you will know thereis no happiness greater than in acting as a freeborn child of God.Never let life beat you down. Beat life! If you have a strong will you canovercome all difficulties. Affirm, even in the midst of trials: “Danger and Iwere born together, and I am more dangerous than danger!” This is a truth youshould always remember; apply it and you will see that it works. Don’t behavelike a cringing mortal being. You are a child of God![../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0060.html#footnote-340-backlink] From the hymn, In the Garden, by C.Austin Miles.2 [part0060.html#footnote-339-backlink] The death of Paramahansaji’s mother whenhe was about eleven was a turning point in his life, strengthening his alreadyardent spiritual inclinations into an iron resolve to find God. The divinewisdom garnered in previous incarnations manifested early in this one; thus hewas able by discrimination to see the inherent disillusionment in theexperiences of this world, and to realize that lasting happiness could come onlyfrom God. (Publisher’s Note)3 [part0060.html#footnote-338-backlink] Matthew 26:41.4 [part0060.html#footnote-337-backlink] Bhagavad Gita II:60.5 [part0060.html#footnote-336-backlink] This is particularly true of persons inwhose subconscious minds are latent strong bad habits from previous lives. Thefirst acceptance of the temptation to perform that same wrong action in thislife triggers an already long-established habit mechanism from before.6 [part0060.html#footnote-335-backlink] Bhagavad Gita XVI:11.7 [part0060.html#footnote-334-backlink] Bhagavad Gita IV:36."},{"pageContent":"Developing Dynamic WillSelf-Realization Fellowship International Headquarters, Los Angeles, California,January 11, 1949God sent man on earth empowered with certain physical, mental, and spiritualforces that he can wield, and, by their wise use, produce intended definiteresults. The force that runs machinery is electricity. And this complex humanmachine that God has given us, a movable structure of bones covered with tenderflesh and consisting of trillions of cells, is run by prana, intelligent lifeforce, traveling like electricity through the wires of the nerves.In childhood the body is more responsive to the mind; it can more easily makethe body do its bidding. But later on, as the child develops various habits, thebody and mind do not work in the same harmony as before. Although, as I haveoften pointed out, the material form is only a dream in the consciousness ofGod, so long as you have to use the physical body, it should be under thecontrol of your mind.Troubles will always strike at the body, for this is a law of life; in spite ofdifficulties, you should keep such mental neutrality that the mind is notaffected by outer conditions.St. Francis of Assisi suffered terribly, yet he was mentally unaffected. Shortlybefore his death he was going blind. The doctor advised a treatment thatrequired cauterization of the saint’s face, from the eyebrows back to the ears,with a white-hot iron bar. There were no anesthetics then. The disciples presentcould not bear the sight, but St. Francis told the physician to proceed with thetreatment. He welcomed Brother Fire with sweet words and never showed that hefelt even the slightest connection between the mind and the body. The Lord wantsyou also to understand this truth: that within your perishable body is aninviolable, immortal soul.It is an error to suppose that masters do not suffer at all. Jesus let his bodysuffer the pains of crucifixion, even though he was already redeemed, for hethereby willingly worked out on his own body some of the karmic suffering duehis disciples and the world. But he knew the relationship between mind and body;he saw them as a delusory creation in the cosmic dream of God. The body ismerely a cluster of sensations. It is not easy to cut off sensations, but youcan do so by remaining constantly in the consciousness that you are a soul, onewith Spirit. When the mind is almost wholly dominated by the body and itsdemands, as is the case with most persons, it is best to begin gradually, inlittle things, to dissociate the mind from the body.One difference between an ordinary man and a superman is that the ordinary mancries and gives in to suffering if he is hurt, but the yogi is established inthe consciousness that he is not the body, that he is apart from it. Thisrealization is with me all the time. Sometimes I see myself walking, and I amsimultaneously aware that I have no body. In the divine consciousness yourealize that you, as soul, have no hands, eyes, ears, or feet, nor any need ofthese physical adjuncts; yet you can use and move these bodily instruments. Itis possible to hear, see, smell, taste, and touch with mind power alone. Inclairaudience, for example, one hears through the power within. Many saints hearthe voice of God or one of His angels guiding them. They hear not with ears butwith mind. Such a state of consciousness is a real experience, not imagination.But it cannot become your experience unless you meditate. If you meditate withthe greatest devotion, someday when you least expect it you will have the sameexperience, and you will understand what I am speaking of.God is constantly showing me this truth, that the body is unreal. He has alsoshown me that this body shall suffer. But the physical suffering this body willendure has nothing to do with my consciousness. It comes from taking on thenegative karma of others, and has no connection with misery-producing desires ofself. If this body does some good to the world and to others, fine. A masterdoes not care what happens to his body. He just looks after it that others maybe benefited.The only time the ordinary person is not conscious of the body is during sleep;yet upon waking, he is immediately conscious of how well or poorly he slept.Some materialists think that we are wholly unconscious when we are asleep, butthis is not true. How could we know, upon waking, how well or ill we slept,unless we were conscious during sleep? We can safely say that the mind can existwithout the body.Wisdom and Will Govern Body and MindWhat, then, are the principal powers that govern body and mind? Wisdom and will.Wisdom is the soul’s intuitive, direct knowledge of truth. During warfare, rangefinders are used to determine where to fire shells; once the range is found, theguns are effectively fired. Wisdom is your range finder, and your will gives thefiring power to accomplish your ends according to the dictates of your wisdom.Your will should always be guided by wisdom. One without the other is dangerous.If you have wisdom but not sufficient will to follow through as wisdom dictates,it is hurtful to your well-being; if you have a strong will but no wisdom, thereis every chance of “misfiring” and destroying yourself.Your intelligence is not guided by true wisdom if it fails to show you the rightthing that you should do. And, if it doesn’t encourage the strength of willnecessary to carry out the behests of your soul, then that power of intelligenceis not fulfilling its true purpose. “The senses are said to be superior (to thephysical body); the mind is superior to the sense faculties; the intelligence issuperior to the mind; but he (the Self) is superior to the intelligence.”1[part0061.html#footnote-344]Most people are like automatons. They breakfast, go to work, have lunch, go backto work, come home to dinner, watch TV, and go to bed; then the body machine isshut off for the night. Those who live in this way are using only mechanicalwill, performing most of their actions as a matter of habit, accomplishing theirduties always in a certain way. They make little or no effort to exercise theirwill consciously. True, they are using will power all the time in performingthese habitual actions, but it is purely mechanical; it is not dynamic will.Physiological Will—First Expression of Will PowerWhen human beings are born, the initial expression of will power is the baby’sfirst cry, which opens up the lungs and causes breathing to begin. Sages saythat the soul doesn’t like being caged in the feeble little baby body; its firstexperience in that form is to cry. The soul realizes that in the human form itwill again go through many struggles, and says, “Lord, why did you put me hereagain?” Many babies’ hands are folded at birth. Their soul is worshiping God inthis way and praying, “O Spirit, release me in this life.”Will is a tremendous factor in life. It is the power by which you can reach theheights of God-realization, or go down into the deepest strata of ignorance. Thecry of a newborn child is an expression of physiological will; the baby wills toremove the discomfort it feels. Most people have not risen above that state ofbabyhood. They immediately want to be rid of any discomfort, and whenever theysee anything that attracts them, they cry for it. They think they have got tohave it, that they can’t live without it. The will that is thus overpowered bythe senses is called physiological will—body-bound will, following the dictatesof the senses.It is terrible to use any kind of drug, for the drug enslaves the will to thebody. I once knew a man who used opium. All day long he slept in a stupor. Ittook him years to overcome his slavery. To use narcotics is one of the greatestsins against Spirit. Drink is the same. Both mean destruction of will power. Thegreat saints have warned against them. Under no circumstance should you letyourself be tempted, for in a short while you can be lost. Drink and drugs aresins against the soul because they paralyze the will, without whichsoul-realization and salvation are impossible.Many people are bound by physiological will. The very power that governs pranaand enables it to efficiently operate the human machine is destroyed when stronghabits of sex or drink or hatred take over. And once they are established theyare very difficult to conquer. Once you are in the habit of showing temperwhenever you are crossed, you follow that habit in spite of your wish to behaveotherwise. Habit destroys the supreme gift of heaven—will power—by which you canwork out your own salvation.Without Wisdom, Will Becomes Habit-BoundIf God and heaven were imposed on us, then we would be their slaves. But theLord has given us free choice by which we can accept good or cast it out, acceptevil or cast it out. The powers that God has given you by which you can makethis choice are wisdom and will. Find out whether you have control over yourwill or not. Don’t let your will be devitalized by bad habits.After physiological will comes habit-bound will. Your will automatically entersthis second phase unless it is guided by wisdom. Sometimes a good man’s child islacking in truthfulness and good habits. Certainly the child has had everyopportunity to learn to be good; yet the moment he becomes old enough to startusing his own will, he gets into all kinds of mischief. Why? Usually in suchcases the child’s nature from past lives is karmically inclined toward wrongthinking and habits. Through his family training in this life he learns toperform good actions; but they are only superimposed on his real nature. Becausehis will is controlled only by mechanical good habits, rather than by soulwisdom and true understanding, he readily succumbs to temptations when he isfree of the good influence of the family.If you ask thieves and habitual drinkers if they like their way of life, theyusually say “No.” They thought when they started their wrong actions that theywould be happy. They never realized that the effects would be hurtful to them.For this reason I deeply feel for people who have done wrong. I cry for them.“But for the grace of God, there go I.” Evil is a sort of opiate. That is why weshould have places where people who have gone wrong can learn how to live andhow to think. Jail is not a suitable place of reform. Such persons need to mixwith superior men who can help them.All around you are thieves of circumstances, trying to steal your vitality ofwill; but no one can take away your will but yourself. The child wants his ownway. When he grows up, unless his will has been curbed and guided by wisdom, hefinds that he is a slave to desires. Are you not doing things today that youknow you ought not to do, and which you know will bring you unhappiness lateron? Overstimulation of the senses devitalizes the will, so do not create anunnatural craving for anything. Suppose you like a certain food very much. Yourwill power should be such that you can do without it henceforth.It is impossible to say what you really like and don’t like, because yourinclinations are always changing. If you analyze yourself you will see that inthe matter of likes and dislikes we are all crazy. We don’t know why we likecertain things and don’t like others. What you like through the influence ofyour wisdom, and what you like as a result of your physiological habits, are twodifferent things. I can make myself like something, and the next minute I canmake myself repelled by it.To be guided by wisdom is to be king of the world. The wise man tries first todetermine if he is right; then he acts. But if he makes a decision and thenfinds out he was wrong, he immediately acknowledges his mistake. Never use yourwill power to be stubborn. You can talk with some people for an hour, and theyseemingly agree with you, and then they turn around and say just the opposite.They don’t want to give up their own way. That is not will power, but slavery tothe ego. You can see such slaves all around you. They think they are free, buttheir will is chained; they perform actions mechanically, guided by good or byevil habits. But when you can say, “I stay away from evil because evil worksagainst my happiness,” or “I am good, not because I am forced to be, but becausegood leads to my own happiness”—that is wisdom. Such was my Guru’s training. Onething we should always remember: If will is guided by wisdom, it will producesomething constructive in our life.When Jesus said to the Heavenly Father, “Thy will be done,”2[part0061.html#footnote-343] it was not because he lacked will power, butbecause he wanted his will to be guided by God’s. When the Divine Willintimated, “Give up the body,” Jesus had to use a great deal of will power toconquer the weakness of the flesh. Human will has become divine will, completelyattuned to Spirit, when even though it is necessary to give up the body, one isable to do so willingly, as Christ did. A body-bound slave would have said,“They are trying to crucify me; I must try to save myself.” If Jesus had donethat, he would not have been the Christ who lives in our hearts today.Stages of Will DevelopmentMan progresses from the physiological will of infancy to the unthinking will ofchildhood. That is when he is used to obeying his mother, doing whatever shetells him to do. After unthinking will comes blind will; he gets away from themother’s will and begins to feel his own will power. This comes in youth. Hetests his own will and begins to use it to get what he sets his heart on.As a child I wanted a bicycle and I got it. Then I wanted a horse, but I didn’tget it. A long time after, though, I did receive it. Every desire that I havehad has been satisfied by the Lord. Everything I have wished for has come to me.That was His blessing.I was always careful that my wish was right before I used my will to carry itout. It is good to be stubborn in good things, but never otherwise. When you arewrong, you should correct yourself. If you don’t blind yourself to good by usingyour will for wrong things, then you progress from blind will to thinking will.After Mother died, when I was only eleven years old, and so grief-stricken! myeldest sister Roma loved to guide me. Others tried to use force, but Roma won meby love. Even when I was obstinately saying to her, “Go away, go away,” I foundmyself obeying her wishes.The nature of a saint is tender like a flower, but stronger than thunder when hemakes up his mind about something good, because his will is guided by wisdom. Itwas not the easiest thing to convince my Guru when I felt I had a better idea,but as soon as he saw that I offered a different angle he would say: “You areright. Let us do it that way.” But when I was wrong, he couldn’t be moved.Thinking will is the most marvelous instrument you can imagine. Are you governedby thinking will, or by blind will, or by physiological will? Thinking will isthe way toward wisdom. When you get a notion in your mind that you must go tothe movies, that is physiological will. And when you decide, “Well, it doesn’tmatter, I will go some other time,” that is thinking will.Will that is not guided by habit is thinking will. If you don’t want to smoke,you should not smoke. If you do not feel hungry, don’t eat just because ofhabit. Whenever I wish to refrain from taking food, no one can tempt me to eat.Another habit amongst those hardest to control is that of harsh speech. Speakingunkindly to others paralyzes your will. Never be cranky. Whenever you get angryyou make your face ugly. Be so loving and kind that everyone who meets you saysof you, “I would like to see that person again.” When you control your ownspeech you will not be so sensitive to others’ remarks about you. I quit angerwhen I was a little child. But I often discipline with strong words thoseunderstanding ones whom God has sent me for training. To those who don’tunderstand, I never say anything.See how wonderful will power is. After you have developed thinking will, youbegin to reason, “I must produce something worthwhile with this power,” and youtake up one thing at a time and try to accomplish it. You revolve that willaround a problem of health or of finances or of controlling a habit, or aroundthe desire to know God. If you will and act until victory, then you haveattained dynamic will.The World Will Try to Trick YouEverything in life tempts you away from God. In the beginning most devotees falldown, because they don’t use their divine will; they put off meditation. Dayafter day, week after week, they put it off. You know you want to love God, youknow you ought to get busy making the effort now, and still you procrastinate. Iremember a period in my childhood when I lost a great deal of time in thismanner. I was already meditating every day, and I had resolved to meditate muchlonger each day. But I kept putting it off until suddenly I realized a wholeyear had gone by. Then I remembered the story about the cat and the sparrow.The cat caught a sparrow, but the sparrow was wise. He reminded the cat that itwas proper first to lick clean his face and paws in preparation for the sparrowmeal. This made sense to the cat, so he let the sparrow go and took his timewashing himself. In the meantime the sparrow flew away to a high branch. The catfinally said, “You can come down now. I am ready for my dinner.” But the sparrowchirped, “Too bad; I am now at the top of the tree.” So the cat resolved:“Henceforth, I will eat my sparrow first and then wash myself.”First things must come first. When you awaken in the morning, meditate. If youdon’t, the whole world will crowd in to claim you, and you will forget God. Atnight, meditate before sleep claims you. I am so strongly established in thehabit of meditation that even after I lie down to sleep at night, I find I ammeditating. I can’t sleep in the ordinary way. The habit of being with God comesfirst.In Your Will Power Lies the Image of GodWill power means freedom. Will power means Heaven. If you don’t permit your willto be weakened by the attractions of the world, you will reach your divine goal.But most of you have allowed your will to be sapped by bad habits—many of youindulge in them every day—smoking, drinking, angry speech. You think you can’tdo without these things. But there was a time when you didn’t know what smokewas, or what drink was, or what anger was. You have given up your freedom byacquiring these habits. Must you remain a slave to them? How can you find Godunless you free your will power, by eliminating these worldly habits and byusing that will to meditate instead?No matter what happens to your body, meditate. Never go to sleep at night untilyou have communed with God. Your body will remind you that you have worked hardand need rest, but the more you ignore its demands and concentrate on the Lord,the more you will burn with joyous life, like a globe afire. Then you will knowthat you are not the body. In your will power lies the image of God. That imagehas been desecrated because you have made a slave of your mind. When I leftIndia to come to America, my Guru said: “Forget you were born among Hindus, anddon’t adopt all the ways of the Americans....Be your true self, a child of God.”By following his wise advice, I have kept my will free. If the whole world stoodagainst me, and I saw that I was right and others were wrong, I would not changemy mind.Nothing Is Impossible When Will Becomes DynamicChoose a good, wholesome, constructive goal and then determine that you aregoing to achieve it. No matter how many times you fail, keep on trying. Nomatter what happens, if you have unalterably resolved, “The earth may beshattered, but I will keep on doing the best I can,” you are using dynamic will,and you will succeed. That dynamic will is what makes one man rich and anotherman strong and another man a saint.It is not Jesus and a few others who alone know God. If you make the right kindof effort, you will find God. What is the value of using dynamic will today tobe a great doctor, or a successful businessman, when tomorrow you may die? Thisis why Jesus said, “Seek ye first the kingdom of God.”3[part0061.html#footnote-342] Use your will to know God first; then He willdirect your path in life.You are using dynamic will when day and night you whisper within, “Lord, Lord,Lord,” with the deepest desire to find Him. It is better to use your will toseek God than for anything else. I am so happy that He blessed me with thedivine will power that my guru, Sri Yukteswarji, awakened in me. Before I metMaster I was exercising that will power right and left in useless things. Buteven then, whenever I started something, I employed dynamic will to complete it.I remember the first time I used dynamic will to help others. My friend and Iwere just little boys then. One day I said to him, “We are going to feed fivehundred people.”“But we haven’t a cent!” he exclaimed. “We are going to do it just the same,” Iassured him. “And I think the money is going to come through you.”“That is impossible!” he scoffed. An intuitive conviction prompted me to say:“Don’t offend your mother in any way. Do whatever she asks you to do.”One day later he came running and told me this story. “I was bathing and Mothercalled me. I was going to say, ‘Don’t bother me now while I am bathing,’ butinstead I asked her what she wanted. She told me to go and see my aunt who livednearby. I said, ‘All right.’“When I went to see my aunt, the first thing she said to me was, ‘Who is thiscrazy boy you are mixing with? Have you lost your mind? What is this I hearabout your feeding five hundred people?’ I was angry with her. ‘I must leavenow,’ I told her, and started to go. But she stopped me, saying, ‘Your friendmay be crazy, but his idea is good. Here are twenty rupees.’”The boy had nearly fainted with surprise. He ran to me at once to tell me thenews. When we went to buy the rice and other things, the people in theneighborhood had already heard of our plan, and added more food. In the end wefed two thousand people! The same divinely charged will power also brought aboutthe first library I founded, Saraswat Library in Calcutta.When you make up your mind to do good things, you will accomplish them if youuse dynamic will power to follow through. No matter what the circumstances are,if you go on trying, God will create the means by which your will shall find itsproper reward. This is the truth Jesus referred to when he said: “If ye havefaith, and doubt not,...if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, andbe thou cast into the sea, it shall be done.”4 [part0061.html#footnote-341] Ifyou continuously use your will power, no matter what reverses come, it willproduce success and health and power to help people, and above all, it willproduce communion with God.This is the kind of will power you must develop—the will power that will run theocean dry if necessary in order to accomplish what is good. The greatest willshould be used to meditate. The Lord wants us to discover our divine will anduse it to find Him. Develop this God-seeking dynamic will. It is not profoundwords that will give you emancipation, but your own efforts through meditation.[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0061.html#footnote-344-backlink] Bhagavad Gita III:42.2 [part0061.html#footnote-343-backlink] Matthew 26:42.3 [part0061.html#footnote-342-backlink] Matthew 6:33.4 [part0061.html#footnote-341-backlink] Matthew 21:21."},{"pageContent":"Seek God Now!Self-Realization Fellowship International Headquarters, Los Angeles, California,July 15, 1941God-realization is attained only by great effort on the part of the yogi, and bydivine grace. Though God can be approached by law, still, as the Searcher ofHearts, He must be convinced that a devotee really wants Him before He sends Hisgrace. God withholds final illumination from a devotee, however perfected he maybe in the science of Yoga, who does not wholeheartedly desire Him.I recall a time in the ashram of my guru, Swami Sri Yukteswar, when month aftermonth, with the greatest devotion, I was seeking God; yet I was experiencing asort of stagnation. When I questioned Master about my problem, he said, “Youthink that if you had more mental power or more miracle power you would realizemore fully that God is with you. But that is not so. Suppose He responded bygiving you control over the whole universe. Possession of such power would leaveyour heart still unsatisfied. God is the Ever New Joy you already feel inmeditation. When man loves that Joy above everything else in this world,desiring it more than money and fame, more than his indulgences in moods andhabits and sensory experiences, God will open the way.” Few devotees areprepared to make such “sacrifices.”1 [part0062_split_000.html#footnote-351]It is at once very easy and very hard to please God. He is playing with Hisdevotees even in tests, and He tests them all the time.How easy it is to pack the day with foolishness, how difficult to fill it withworthwhile activities and thoughts! Yet God is not so much interested in what weare doing as in where the mind is. Everyone has a different difficulty, but Goddoesn’t listen to any excuses. He wants the devotee’s mind to be engrossed inHim in spite of any troublesome circumstances. Even as I am engaged in talkingto you now, my mind is ever on God. I am with Him inwardly all the time. I livein His joy. Loving and craving naught else but that joy, I find that allobstacles to God-union give way before me. This declaration is not a fairy tale;it is true. But not until God has received all of the devotee’s love will Hecome. It will seem that He has forsaken us sometimes, but such tests areinescapable; if we steadfastly refuse to give up our search, God receives us asHis own.In worldly ambitions there is always an element of uncertainty. Some peoplespend year after year trying wholeheartedly but unsuccessfully to make money.But in the spiritual path no wholehearted devotee is ever unsuccessful. Hislabors are never in vain.Perseverance Is the Whole Magic of Spiritual SuccessThe greatest enemy of divine realization is the body; it becomes easily tiredand wants to give up. A true devotee never relaxes his effort nor admits thesupremacy of the body. Continuous vigilance is required. We must believe,against all seeming odds, that He will come. Even an agnostic who thinks thatthere is little likelihood that God exists, but who perseveres in the search forHim, will ultimately find Him. Even though God may not seem to respond, oneshould not succumb to doubts but should unremittingly continue in the holyquest. Perseverance is the whole magic of spiritual success. If the Lordresponded easily and openly to the devotee’s prayers for divine illumination,all men would immediately seek Him—not for love of Him, but for the illimitablerewards.This world is God’s playhouse. It is part of His intricate drama here that Hehas made it very difficult to discover His presence. Because the search is noteasy, we tend to forget Him. Even when we see our loved ones pulled away intothe mysterious unknown, we do not think seriously about our having to go too,sometime. But one should not wait for the approach of death to realize theimportance of seeking God. It is every man’s supreme and immediate duty. Eachminute of life should be a divine quest. The burning question in our heartsshould be: “When shall I find Thee, O Lord?”No matter what happens, never give up the vital search. Suppose one sits tomeditate, and friends arrive. There is nothing to do but to cut the meditationshort; yet one may still keep his mind on God. Whatever the activity, the innerattention should be on Him. He is so necessary to us!Get busy now; time is passing, and one day the fearful realization will comethat life has gone by as though in a twinkling, and still He has not been found.Let no day pass without your having made an effort to meditate on Him. Soon,surprisingly little effort will be needed. Great happiness comes to the devoteewho is steadfast. Without unquenchable enthusiasm nothing can be gained.The Bhagavad Gita teaches the importance on the spiritual path of rising abovebodily sensations. The contact of the senses with outer environment producessensations of heat and cold, pleasure and pain, and other oppositional states.The average man is easily affected by these sensations, but the Gita teachesthat one should be neutral to them. This is not a recommendation to be rash! Ifthe yogi finds the sensations of heat or cold are extremely difficult to bear,he should seek an outward remedy without becoming inwardly involved. He who canpractice mental neutrality is on the way to becoming a saint. He who lives inthe bodily temple without being affected by changing sensory perceptions,remaining evenminded during pleasure and pain, cool and heat, and so on, becomesa true king among men. Having attained changelessness, he is one with thechangeless Spirit.All who came to my Guru’s ashram for spiritual training were disciplined in thisway. The aspiring yogi of the West as well as of the East must disciplinehimself similarly. He should refrain from making too much fuss about the body.If he sees he is finding time for everything else but is too busy for God, heshould take the whip of discipline to himself. Why be afraid? There iseverything to gain. If a man will not himself cry and struggle to attain his ownsalvation, will anyone else do it for him?God-realization is the most difficult state to reach. Let no one fool himself,nor think that someone else can “give” it to him. Whenever I fell into a stateof mental stagnation, my Guru could do nothing for me. But I never gave uptrying to keep in tune with him by cheerfully performing whatever he asked me todo. “I have come to him for God-realization,” I reasoned, “and I must listen tohis advice.” At his ashram we young disciples seemed to be always cooking, andthere were many other excuses not to meditate. Yet even though I worked harderthere than in my own home, I found the environment of the ashram to bespiritually helpful to me.Keep a Daily Appointment With GodLet no devotee miss his daily appointment with God. The mind may suggest themovies or some other distraction; but when the time comes for God each day, keepthat sacred engagement. Otherwise you will be a long time finding Him.There is a personal element in the search for God that is more important thanmastery over the whole science of Yoga. The Heavenly Father wants to be surethat His children desire only Him, that they will not be satisfied with anythingelse. When God is made to feel that He is not first in the devotee’s heart, Hestands aside. But to him who says, “O Lord, it matters not if I lose sleeptonight, so long as I am with Thee,” He will come. Positively! From behind thecountless screens of this mysterious world the Ruler of creation will come forthto reveal Himself behind each one. He talks to His true devotees, and playshide-and-seek with them. Sometimes He suddenly unveils a comforting truth whenone is worried. In time, and in direct or indirect ways, He grants every wish ofHis devotee.Fulfillment of a particular desire seems necessary only if one lacks convictionthat he can find perfect fulfillment in God. One who is at peace in God is nottortured by unfulfilled earthly desires. “Taking shelter in Me, all beings canachieve the Supreme Fulfillment....”2 [part0062_split_000.html#footnote-350] Noone can hurt me by thwarting me in some outward matter, because to me God issufficient; His joyous presence is the only conditioning factor in my happiness.Each of you should try resolutely to meditate and to feel His presence, and seehow quickly you will become aware of His favor.The world worships men of power, like Alexander the Great and Napoleon, butthink of their mental states! Then think of the peace that Christ had. His peacecould not be taken from him. We think we will seek that peace “tomorrow.” Anyonewho reasons this way will never find it. Seek it now. We do not neglect eatingand our other duties to the body. They are very important to us. But one wholoves God intensely loses all worry about the body. This is what Jesus meantwhen he said: “Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for thebody, what ye shall put on.”3 [part0062_split_000.html#footnote-349]Not until you feel in your consciousness the absolute importance of God will youreach Him. Do not permit life to cheat you. Form those good habits that make fortrue happiness. Follow a simple diet, exercise the body, and meditate daily—nomatter what happens, rain or shine. If you are unable to exercise and meditatein the morning, do it at night. Pray to Him every day, “Lord, even if I die, orif the whole world crumbles away, I am going to find time daily to be withThee.”Who is interested in God alone? Very few. Most people want to talk about spiritsand miracles and so on. But he who knows God will be told by Him everything hehas ever wanted to know.Kriya Yoga—Highest Method of God-ContactKriya Yoga is the highest method of God-contact. In my own search for God Itraveled all over India, and heard wisdom from the lips of a number of hergreatest masters. I can therefore vouch for the fact that in Self-Realizationteachings are the highest truths and scientific techniques given to mankind byGod and the Great Ones.The aftereffects of Kriya bring with them the utmost peace and bliss. The joythat comes with Kriya is greater than the joys of all pleasurable physicalsensations put together. “Unattracted to the sensory world, the yogi experiencesthe ever new joy inherent in the Self. Engaged in divine union of the soul withSpirit, he attains bliss indestructible.”4[part0062_split_000.html#footnote-348] From that joy experienced in meditation Ireceive the rest of a thousand sleeps. Sleep becomes virtually unnecessary tothe advanced Kriya Yogi.When by Kriya Yoga the devotee enters samadhi, wherein his eyes, breath, andheart are quieted, another world comes into view. Breath, sound, and movement ofthe eyes belong to this world. But the yogi who has control of the breath5[part0062_split_000.html#footnote-347] may enter the heavenly astral and causalworlds and commune there with God’s saints, or enter cosmic consciousness andcommune with God. The yogi is not interested in anything else.Whoever will give less importance to everything else, remembering what I havesaid, will get to God without fail. Everyone must eventually get there. But whatis the use of my telling these truths to you unless you practice them? My lovingattention on you is not wanting; but even if I were to remind you each day ofthese truths, they would not help anyone who does not himself make the effort topractice meditation. No one is greater than God, enthroned in the heart of everyman; yet even He does not force us to seek Him. He has given us free will. Buthe who follows a true guru, and keeps faith with him by adhering to hisinstructions, will transform his whole life. “Comprehending that wisdom from aguru, thou wilt not again fall into delusion.”6[part0062_split_000.html#footnote-346]To Find God, Be Loyal to GodIt is easy to see in a person’s face whether or not he is a lover of God. Truedevotees may be called fanatical in their devotion to Him. The only right kindof fanaticism is loyalty to God—night and day, night and day, thinking of Him.Without this kind of loyalty it is impossible to find God. Those who never missKriya, and who sit long in meditation and pray intensely to God, will discoverthe longed-for Treasure.This world is but a dream. Just as in the movies there is no essentialdifference between the ocean and the sky, which are simply two different ratesof light-vibration, so it is in this world. Sorrow and joy, pain and pleasure,cold and heat are but dreams of this world. The Lord is the only Reality. Weshould always pray that no test or temptation will ever have the power to makeus forget Him. When I pray thus I receive more result than at any other time.Then, even if something very serious comes to divert me, I nevertheless seeimmediately that I am safe in His arms.It is difficult to know Him. The path to God is like a razor’s edge. Butdiscouragement is never justified, because we don’t have to acquire or winanything; we have only to realize that God is already within us. That is whynegativeness should be completely put out of one’s mind. Cooperating with theguru’s thoughts makes the path easy. If the disciple says, “I can’t do this; itis too hard for me,” he is held back. No one has entangled us in moods andhabits and desires but ourselves, and no one but ourselves will free us.Keep a diary of your spiritual life. I used to make a record of how long I hadmeditated daily and how deep I had gone. Seek solitude as much as possible. Donot spend your leisure in mixing with people for merely social purposes. God’slove is hard to find in company. The Lord is discovered in silence, and Kriyashows you the way.To establish God-consciousness in the souls of men is my great interest. I seethat everything else is futile. The one purpose of Self-Realization Fellowshipis to teach the individual the way to personal contact with God. Those who makethe effort cannot miss Him. Make a solemn promise in your heart and pray to theFather that He bless you with the haunting desire to find Him, that you may notwaste any more time in the useless diversions of this earth.Pray to the Father: “As we are bound by Thy laws of creation to work, may weperform our duties only to please Thee. Bless us every moment, that we realizeThou art more important than eating or sleeping or anything else. Bless us thatwe be able to meet Thy tests and to avoid the terrible temptations of the flesh.May we all, thy princely children, be diademed in Thy bosom.”And my prayer for each of you is that from today you will make a supreme effortfor God, and that you never give up until you are established in Him. If youlove Him you will practice Kriya with the greatest devotion and faithfulness.Continuously seek Him through prayer and Kriya Yoga. Be of good cheer, for asBabaji once said, quoting from the Bhagavad Gita:7[part0062_split_000.html#footnote-345] “Even a tiny bit of this real religionprotects one from great fear (the colossal sufferings inherent in the repeatedcycles of birth and death).”[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0062_split_000.html#footnote-351-backlink] “The harvest truly isplenteous, but the laborers are few” (Matthew 9:37).2 [part0062_split_000.html#footnote-350-backlink] Bhagavad Gita IX:32.3 [part0062_split_000.html#footnote-349-backlink] Luke 12:22.4 [part0062_split_000.html#footnote-348-backlink] Bhagavad Gita V:21.5 [part0062_split_000.html#footnote-347-backlink] See breath[part0074.html#_idTextAnchor091] in glossary.6 [part0062_split_000.html#footnote-346-backlink] Bhagavad Gita IV:35.7 [part0062_split_000.html#footnote-345-backlink] Bhagavad Gita II:40."},{"pageContent":"Administration building at international headquarters, Self-RealizationFellowship [../images/00020.jpeg]Administration building at international headquarters, Self-RealizationFellowship (Yogoda Satsanga Society of India), established by ParamahansaYogananda in 1925 atop Mt. Washington in Los Angeles, California."},{"pageContent":"Why Waste Time?God Is the Joy You SeekAn informal talk to resident renunciants and guests at Self-RealizationFellowship International Headquarters, Los Angeles, California, on ChristmasDay, 1939This Christmas will remain in my memory always, for it is a great joy andprivilege to be with devotees of the Lord. Yesterday, when we communed withChrist in our all-day meditation here, we felt that we are all one family inGod. In meditation, souls meet on the plane of the heart and rejoice in Spirit.May all men and all churches be inspired by the humble example of our spiritualcelebration of Christmas to devote, as we have, one day entirely to worship ofthe Christ Consciousness. The eight hours that we meditated yesterday passedlike eight minutes! The love of God is greater than all the pleasures of thesenses. If once we experience His love in the heart, we become so imbued with itwe can never forget it. Last night I had no sleep, but I didn’t need sleep. Forin the eternal joy that I feel in the Christ Consciousness nothing else mattersat all.Dear ones, my greatest gift to you this Christmas is my love. To love all, tosacrifice for all, and to have boundless pleasure in helping others—this is thegrace I have received. We should do for others as if it were for ourselves. If acoat that we need costs fifty dollars, we spend it gladly. When we can do thatfor another with the same sense of joy, we know the true spirit of giving.“My Words Shall Not Pass Away”May the Christmas spirit you feel not end with today; rather may it be with youevery night as you meditate. Then in the silence of your own mind, as you driveaway all restless thoughts, Christ Consciousness will come. If we all follow thespirit of Jesus we shall surely experience every day his presence within us. Forthe Christ Consciousness that was manifest in Jesus was not meant to be thelight of one century only, but of all centuries for eternity. That is why Jesussaid: “Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.”1[part0063.html#footnote-360] The joy that Christ felt, the joy that he told theworld to seek, and the spiritual rules of conduct he exhorted us to follow—tolove our enemies and to turn the other cheek—are timeless. The commandment tolove God with all your heart, mind, and soul was not intended merely for thebiblical generations; it is an eternal law.Life Is a CaravanMany who were with us last Christmas are not with us now, and who knows who willbe here next Christmas? Such is the way of life. And still life goes on. It is acaravan in which we are traveling for a little while. Some of our companionshave fallen into ditches of folly and ignorance, but when they are tired of thesuffering they experience, they will begin to seek the safe guidance of theOwner of the caravan, who is also the Owner of this earth—none other than theHeavenly Father. Even though we part in this caravan, and the beginning and endof our journey are shrouded in darkness, still, life has a deep meaning: toteach us to seek God earnestly.This world may also be likened to a play. The actors do not come out of nowhere;there is a backstage. After their part is over, the players do not cease toexist; they only go behind the scenes for a rest. It is the scheme of the StageManager that we come here to play for a time on this stage of life; then wedepart. We are not dead—only backstage, hidden behind the screen of time,according to the direction of the Stage Manager. And we will be seen on thisstage of life again and again, until we become such good actors that we can playour parts perfectly, according to the Divine Will. Then He will say: “You needgo no more out. You have done My Will. You have played your part, and actedwell. You did not lose courage. Now you have come back to Me, to be a pillar ofimmortality in the temple of My Eternal Existence.”2[part0063.html#footnote-359]Good Company Is of Supreme ImportanceTo play your part well on earth is not easy. It is only by good associationsthat you can find your way out of the darkness of ignorance. The blind cannotlead the blind. Mixing with those who love only social gatherings will wasteyour time, but association with those who love God will give you the love ofGod. The Lord said in the Bhagavad Gita: “Among thousands of men, perhaps onestrives for spiritual attainment; and, among the blessed true seekers thatassiduously try to reach Me, perhaps one perceives Me as I am.”3[part0063.html#footnote-358] Very few people are interested in God. It is saidthat the child is busy with play, the youth is busy with sex, and the adult isbusy with worries. How few think of the eternal bliss of Spirit! But he whoseeks God, and who seeks with all the depth and fervor of his soul until hefinds Him, is wisest of all men. The Lord knows what you think; and if you loveHim He will reveal Himself to you.Never Forget GodNo matter what I have gone through, my joy has been like a silent streamcontinuously flowing beneath the sands of my thoughts. These silent rivers ofdivine joy cannot be seen with the eyes, but whenever you dig deeply through theouter layers of consciousness you discover them. Let not anyone else know howdeeply you feel for the Lord. The Master of the Universe knows of your love;don’t display it before others, or you may lose it.When in the silence of the soul and in every phase of life you turn within andsay, “Father, I have not forgotten You”—when that kind of devotion wells up fromthe depths of your heart—God comes to drink from the fountain of your love. Theonly purpose of life is to enjoy Him. It is possible. I would not speak of it ifI didn’t know His limitless joy and bliss. You too must find Him. God is. Thesaints have not lied to you. And I am not lying to you. Then why waste time? Whybe forgetful of Him? I know how terrible are the consequences. Forgetfulness ofthat inner Source of happiness is the cause of all human suffering and misery.We put forth our hands to receive His gifts of life and sun and food and all theother things He bestows on us; but even as we receive them, we are unmindful ofthe Giver. If you have lovingly given presents to someone and then find out thathe never thinks of you, how hurt you feel! God feels that way, too. Every day weuse His gift of sight to see the world; we accept His gifts of thought andreason, but we are oblivious of Him.If God is ever a beggar, it is to ask your love. He is continuously pursuingyou; He coaxes you through the words of the saints. Do not ignore Him!March on Toward the Lord’s KingdomThe joy that you felt yesterday after eight hours’ meditation is continuous withme. Naught else could give me so much happiness. Everything else is a waste oftime. Why hang on to worldly delusions? Every minute that I am with you I willtry to impress on your consciousness the importance of seeking God. Remember,when you are trying to improve spiritually, you are moving toward His kingdom;and when you are not trying, you are standing still, or slipping backward. Marchon! Use your nights for meditation. That is the way to discover Him. It seemsvery hard to find God, yet He is the easiest to please as soon as you convinceHim that He means everything to you. That day He will come to you.Dear friends, I hope this Christmas will not end tonight for you. My Christmasnever ends. It is with me day and night. The Lord is with me and I am with Him.That is His promise in the Bhagavad Gita: “He who perceives Me everywhere andbeholds everything in Me never loses sight of Me, nor do I ever lose sight ofhim.”4 [part0063.html#footnote-357]Those who are addicted to wine are all the time drunk. Whether they are workingor playing, their mind is on liquor. The Divine Nectar is a million times moreintoxicating. When I am talking to you I am just as much with Him as when I ammeditating. Such love! No tongue can ever describe this happiness. The Biblementions that on the day of Pentecost the Apostles were enveloped by the HolyGhost. Doubters said, “These men are full of new wine.”5[part0063.html#footnote-356] They were drunk, indeed, but with the wine ofdivine bliss!The wellspring of undiluted joy of Spirit lies buried within your soul. Dig withthe pickax of meditation until you discover it, and bathe in that fountain ofeternal bliss.And so, dear ones, my Christmas will go on forever, in ever- increasing joyeverlasting. If this joy were limited, as worldly happiness is, a time wouldcome when all would be finished. But no saint will ever be able to exhaust theever new bliss of God. Even though the masters know Him fully, His joy is evernew to them throughout eternity. If the delights of Spirit were not endless,even the saints would want to come back to earth now and then for diversion,like ordinary mortals who return again and again. But the saints are eternallyhappy, as no one else is. This is the wealth they receive when they give upeverything else for love of the Lord. Nothing can destroy the joy and peace oftheir being. That is Christhood.Please Man by Pleasing GodTherefore seek only to please God. Try to please man, too, but not at the costof pleasing Him. To attain the recognition of man by your own God-realization isthe greatest thing you can do. Time is flying. Why are you waiting? There is noreality to worldly life. Though you have to eat and sleep, one day the switch ofyour heart will be suddenly pulled, and you will have to leave everythingbehind. When a visitor said to me, “I am too busy to meditate,” I replied: “Whenyou die, all your engagements will be canceled. What then? Where will you be ifyou haven’t found God? Your friends will mourn briefly and then resume theirusual preoccupations. Why neglect your one Eternal Friend?”Wisdom becomes dimmed when you use your mind wrongly, or mix with bad company.To seek God is the highest way to happiness. Neither human love nor any othermortal experience comes near His bliss. Anyone who tells you that something elseis more important than seeking the Lord is wrong. Nothing can be greater thanfinding Him who created you. This is why the Hindu scriptures say: “Forsakingall duties, if it is necessary, pursue Me. For the forsaking of all duties youwill incur sin, but I shall forgive that because no duties can be performedwithout receiving power from Me.”6 [part0063.html#footnote-355] Duty to Godnullifies all other duties. When you resolutely leave everything else to attainHim, then you are on the path to realization.To be able to do duty to God and to man is wonderful. To do duty to God withoutduty to the world is all right. And to do duty to the world and not to God is tobe like a mule carrying a bag of gold. The mule knows only the weight of thegold; he cannot use it. To do duty to God first, and then, with Hisconsciousness to help the world, is divine. And this is what theSelf-Realization Fellowship teachings stand for: to gain fellowship with Godthrough realization of the Self; and, having that divine fellowship, help othersto attain it.7 [part0063.html#footnote-354]Wherever your heart is, there your mind is also. Wherever those you love may bein the world, your heart is drawn to them. You must feel that way about God; youmust love Him with all your heart. And love Him also with all your mind; if yourthoughts are roaming as you pray, it is a mockery. Last of all, love God withall your soul. As you approach God, defeating all your temptations with thesword of wisdom, closing one by one the doors of the senses, and one by onesaying good-bye to restless worldly thoughts, then you will love God with allyour heart, all your mind, and all your soul. The moon’s reflection in a cup ofwater that has been stirred appears distorted, but the moon’s reflection is seenperfectly when the water in the cup becomes quiet. Similarly, the soul image hasbecome distorted by the restlessness of your mind, but when you still the mind,by loving God with all your heart, mind, and soul, you behold, within, the clearreflection of the Divine.God is twinkling in the Milky Way, and through our intelligence and reason. Heis present in every blade of grass; every flower mirrors His smile. In everygood thought there is the joy of Spirit. He is everlasting. As you developspiritually you see that He is your true Self, reflected in you as the soul,just as the moon can be reflected in a vessel of water; you realize that you arethe pure image of Divinity. By greater effort you become able to break thevessel of the mortal ego; then the reflected soul image within it becomes onewith the moon of Spirit.Seek the Recognition of GodWe don’t want the praise of man; the recognition of God is what we are seeking.“For what everyone is in Thy sight, so much is he, and no more,” said St.Francis. If before Him we are immaculate, nothing else matters. In doing good wemust sometimes suffer. To find the Lord we must be willing to suffer. What is itto endure discomfort of the flesh and discipline of the mind to gain the eternalsolace of Spirit? Christ’s joy in God was so great he was willing to give up thebody for Him. The purpose of life is to attain that tremendous happiness—to findGod.Renunciation is not an end; it is the means to an end. The real renunciant is hewho lives for God first, regardless of his outer mode of existence. To love Godand conduct your life to please Him—that is what matters. When you will do that,you will know the Lord. Every noble thought in your mind brings you closer toHim. Those thoughts are like a river leading to the ocean of Spirit.Devotion is the one offering that tempts God. He is not moved by all the richgifts and promises that are made to Him. But into the garden of a life redolentwith sweet devotion God is tempted to come. When the fragrance of your devotionoozes forth unceasingly from the rose of your heart, the mighty Deity must cometo you.No matter how our thoughts run away from the Lord or how forlorn we feel, stillthe footsteps of our devotion lead us to the haven of Spirit. No matter how farwe have strayed away, through devotion we can still reach Him; our lives neednot be spent in vain.Although you have regular duties, they are no excuse for saying you cannot seekGod. While others sleep, you concentrate on Him. You will find you are a hundredtimes more happy and rested. Do this night after night, without thinking oftime. When you are meditating, just remind yourself, “I am with Him, and that isall that matters.”When you plant a seed in the ground, you must not take it out every day to seeif it is germinating; you will only hamper its growth. So with the seeds of yourspiritual efforts. Once they are planted, leave them there, and tend themcarefully.I hope you will make a greater spiritual effort from tonight on. Don’t losesight of Him. The world will go on without you. You are not as important as youthink. Countless men have been thrown into the dustbin of the centuries. Do notlet your life pass uselessly. If in your heart you love God, you are greaterthan the most materially accomplished man. When you please God, you come closestto pleasing everybody. So learn to love Him. Don’t feel that you have to mixwith people all the time. When you do mix, do everything you can to help others;but when you are alone, be alone with God. When you attain Him, all things elsewill be added unto you.It is not what you hear that redeems you, but what you do with what you hear.Many hear what they should do, but few act upon it. Don’t paralyze yourdetermination. When you know a thing is right, why shouldn’t you go after it?Why shouldn’t you cry for the Lord until the skies are shaken with your prayers?Surrender to Him completely. And never doubt Him.Dive deep in the ocean of meditation. If you don’t find the pearls of Hispresence, don’t blame the ocean, blame your diving. Dive again and again untilyou find Him. “Seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened untoyou.”8 [part0063.html#footnote-353] Remember, it is the naughty baby who getsthe mother’s attention. The easily pacified infant is soon satisfied with toys.But the naughty baby wants the mother only, and goes on crying until she comes.Cry until the Divine Mother comes!God is so real to His devotees! Every word they have said about Him is true, butHis play is shrouded in mystery. Your seeking must be continuous. You cannotsummon God by a little cry; it must be unceasing, and not quelled by toys ofmoney, fame, and human love. When your desire is only for Him, He will come.Then your lessons in the world are finished. You are filled evermore with thejoy of the Infinite. “He who works for Me alone, who makes Me his goal, wholovingly surrenders himself to Me, who is nonattached (to My delusivecosmic-dream worlds), who bears ill will toward none (beholding Me in all)—heenters My being.”9 [part0063.html#footnote-352][../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0063.html#footnote-360-backlink] Matthew 24:35.2 [part0063.html#footnote-359-backlink] “Him that overcometh will I make apillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out” (Revelation 3:12).3 [part0063.html#footnote-358-backlink] Bhagavad Gita VII:3.4 [part0063.html#footnote-357-backlink] Bhagavad Gita VI:30.5 [part0063.html#footnote-356-backlink] “And when the day of Pentecost was fullycome, they were all with one accord in one place....And they were all filledwith the Holy Ghost....Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.

The supernatural is the only real Substance. Today I waswalking on the Hermitage grounds, beholding the sunshine all around me. As Ipassed the stairway to the beach, I stopped and turned on the electricstair-lights to see if they were working. But I could not see them; for as Istood there the great light of God suddenly came and made it impossible todistinguish lesser lights. Even the sun I could not see at all. Vividly Iunderstood that neither the sunlight nor the electric light is real. The onlytrue light is the light of God.If there should riseSuddenly within the skiesSunburst of a thousand sunsFlooding earth with beams undeemed-of,Then might be that Holy One’sMajesty and radiance dreamed of.1 [part0064.html#footnote-369]In that great vision He showed me worlds upon worlds—endless manifestations ofHis light. These things that I beheld are but expressions of His consciousness.And if we are attuned to Him, our perception is limitless, pervading everywherein the oceanic flow of the Divine Presence.When the Spirit is known, and when we know ourselves as Spirit, there is no landor sea, no earth or sky—all is He. The melting of everything in Spirit is astate no one can describe. A great bliss is felt—eternal fullness of joy andknowledge and love. I can see it in a devotee’s face if inwardly his soul istrembling with that joy, as a leaf trembles in the wind. Such is the yogi. Thisecstasy can only be known by balancing the activity of ordinary life with deep,soulful, undiscourageable meditation.The Way to True FreedomEgotism, pride, greed, anger, and other ugly outgrowths of self-centeredness arebarriers to spiritual development, preventing man’s escape from the misery ofsoul ignorance. The right course is to follow the teachings of a spiritualmaster who has wisdom and who loves God above all else, and to tune in with thewishes of such a guru. That way leads to freedom. Your wishes are guided byhabits of past lives and by new habits you are constantly creating. These holdthe soul prisoner and make it impossible for you to race along the road toeverlasting liberty.On one side of the path of life is the dark valley of ignorance, and on theother side the eternal light of wisdom. When you follow the guidance of a trueguru, you will safely tread the road to freedom. Then everything that you wishfor will be born of wisdom, and will come to you without the slightest effort.The whole universe has been created by the Divine Will, and when you are attunedto it, whatever you want is accomplished just by mere willing. I dare not evenwish anymore, for I know that whatever is in my mind will come to me.The true devotee says, “Lord, I have no desires. I have found all that I want inYou; no other gain could be greater.2 [part0064.html#footnote-368] PossessingHis wisdom, love, and joy, all desires of the heart are satisfied. That is atremendous state. When you are united with Spirit, you are king—a king ofquietude and bliss, fully satisfied and complete within your Self. In youroneness with Him, you see the whole world standing before you, ready to do yourbidding. Because God made man in His image, all those who find Him find alsothat His will in them fulfills their slightest command.With God-Realization Comes All PowerSo long as you have any desire to dominate other people, or to show them howpowerful you are spiritually or in any other way, you will not find soulfreedom. God-awareness begins in humbleness, love, and meditative bliss; butwith the realization of God comes all power. If the little wave knew that behindit is the great ocean, it could say, “I am the ocean.” You should realize thatjust behind your consciousness is the Ocean of God.When Jesus was being crucified he could have reduced his enemies to ashes withone look; but he didn’t do it. Instead, he forgave them. That is the divinenature: peace, love, humbleness, omnipresence, omniscience. He who becomes onewith God has no need to prove to himself or to others the extent of the power hepossesses. He knows within that he has all power at his command, and there isnothing to fear. But he uses his power only when God directs him to do so.The accomplished yogi is awake in his infinite nature and asleep in his materialnature.3 [part0064.html#footnote-367] You should attain this self-mastery. Don’tfool yourself, giving all your time to the world. Outwit the world and itslures: the best way to conserve your time and use it to greatest benefit is toput your whole mind on seeking God day and night, no matter what activities youengage in outwardly.The cow calmly grazing with its calf in the pasture does not show any sign ofworry about the calf, but if you go near it, the cow comes at you immediately.So is the yogi, outwardly busy with his work but inwardly keeping his attentionalways on the Lord.Jesus said, “If thy hand offend thee, cut it off.”4 [part0064.html#footnote-366]He didn’t mean that you should maim your body, but rather that you should cutoff enslaving sense attachments, which prevent you from finding God. Like aninsistent child, constantly call to the Divine Mother until She says: “Allright, what is it you want?” She is so busy with creation, She doesn’t reply atonce; but to the naughty child who cries and cries for Her, She will come.The Divine Mother is most anxious to have you back with Her, but first you mustprove to Her that you want Her alone. You must cry urgently and unceasingly;then She smiles and is with you instantly. Divine Spirit has no partiality; theMother loves all. But Her devotees appreciate Her love, respond to Her love. Isee the effect on people who have gained a little human love, or a littlemoney—how happy they are! But if they could see what strength, what joy, whatlove is in the Divine Mother, they would fly away from all else.God Speaks Only Through His DevoteesTo the world God speaks only through His enlightened devotees. Therefore, thewisest of all actions is to tune in with the will of the guru who is sent to youby the Lord as a response to your soul’s desire. He is not a guru who isself-proclaimed as such; he is a guru who is asked by God to bring others backto Him. When there is a little spiritual desire, the Lord sends books andteachers to further inspire you; and when your desire is stronger, he sends areal guru. “Understand this! By surrendering thyself (to the guru), byquestioning (the guru and thine inner perception), and by service (to the guru),the sages who have realized truth will impart that wisdom to thee.”5[part0064.html#footnote-365]There are teachers who expect their followers to be always at their beck andcall, ready to obey instantly; and if they don’t, the teacher becomes angry. Buta spiritual teacher who knows God and is truly a guru never thinks of himself asa teacher at all. He beholds God’s presence in everyone, and feels no resentmentif some students disregard his wishes. The Hindu scriptures say that those whotune in with the wisdom of a true guru make it possible for the guru to helpthem. “Comprehending that wisdom from a guru, thou, O Arjuna! wilt not againfall into delusion.”6 [part0064.html#footnote-364]The friendship that exists between guru and disciple is eternal. There iscomplete surrender, there is no compulsion, when a disciple accepts the guru’straining.Human friendship is often selfish; when a person ceases to be useful to us, welose our love for him. This is the defect of human love.In friendship that is divine, love that is divine—not conditioned by materialforms but by spiritual law—there is a consciousness of mutual responsibility.When you try to understand a person, it is easy to please him. But when youdon’t try to understand, it is impossible to keep harmony. I can get along withstrangers, but I can best help those who tune in with me. I never would want tohurt anyone. I like to please all—not by sanctioning their wrong desires, but byencouraging them in their right aspirations, that they may really live in theconsciousness of God.God Is the Only GuruOne who loves God can never take pleasure in being a teacher. He knows that Godis the only Guru. I feel as the dust at your feet. This I say out of therealization of that mighty Spirit I behold in each one of you.I was to have gone from this earth a long time ago. I would like to melt thisbody in the Divine Flame and burn the dross, so that the body is no more a partof me that appears separate from the Infinite. One day I shall be gone, but solong as I live on earth, my greatest pleasure is to tell those who tune in withmy wishes, and who trust me, that the only thing I want is to interest them inthat Light which has given me consolation and freedom and assuranceindescribable. “The Light of All Lights, beyond darkness....He is seated in thehearts of all.”7 [part0064.html#footnote-363]In that Light I see all those who have come and gone. I see all creation, andevents that happened many years ago. The history of the world is preserved inthe archives of the eternal sphere beyond. It is another dimension. Here in thisfinite world we behold length, breadth, and thickness, but there is anotherplane where the three dimensions do not exist; all is transparent. Everything isconsciousness. The sense of taste is consciousness. The sense of smell isconsciousness. Our feelings, our thoughts, and our body are nothing butconsciousness. Just as we can see, hear, smell, taste, and touch in a dream, soin that higher sphere we experience all these sensations through pureconsciousness.This is what I am seeing now even as I speak to you. I am not in this body; I ama part of all that exists. These things I am beholding are just as real to me asare you who are in this room. You have to awaken in order to perceive that Godis everywhere and to realize that you have been dreaming. All of you are sittinghere in this dream, and you are part of the dream. Many times I see this room inEternity, and other times I see Eternity in this room. All things have borrowedlife from that Eternal Source.I Cried and Prayed, Day and NightEverything is God. This very room and the universe are floating like a motionpicture on the screen of my consciousness. When you look back at the booth, yousee only the beam of light that is projecting the pictures on the screen. Thatthis creation is naught but a motion picture, created out of God’s light, seemsincredible; but it is true. I look at this room and I see nothing but pureSpirit, pure Light, pure Joy. “He dwells in the world, envelopingall—everywhere.”8 [part0064.html#footnote-362] The pictures of my body and yourbodies and all things in this world are only rays of light streaming out of thatone sacred Light. As I see that Light I behold nothing anywhere but pureSpirit.9 [part0064.html#footnote-361]It seems so simple now; but when as a boy I sat praying night after night, noanswer came. On one side I beheld unenlightened humanity and on the other sideEternity, which would not speak to me. It was a very cruel state—forsaken byGod, I thought. But I was not forsaken by Him; He was hiding behind my thoughts,behind my feelings all the time. When I began to see the light within, my soulwould be mysteriously filled with divine fragrance; I would see revealed all theroots of trees and the sap flowing in them. Then I began to feel the greatSpirit near. Again and again I cried and prayed, day and night, and when nothingany longer meant anything to me, when inside I renounced everything—evenhappiness, lest it be material happiness—then He came to me. Now He is with meevermore. The world may forsake me, but He forsakes me never.I don’t know why I am telling these things to you, but I feel I must do so. Iused to talk of them, but in the presence of those who became indifferent Icouldn’t speak—my mouth wouldn’t open. This time He has made me tell, that youmay know there is nothing to live for except Him. All else will go. Pray onlyfor That which is abiding.Pray Only to Know GodDon’t yearn for human love; it will vanish. Behind human love is the spirituallove of God. Seek that. Don’t pray for home or for money or for love or forfriendship. Don’t pray for anything of this world. Enjoy only what the Lordgives to you. All else leads to delusion. Man has come on earth solely to learnto know God; he is here for no other reason. This is the true message of theLord. To all those who seek and love Him, He tells of that great Life wherethere is no pain, no old age, no war, no death—only eternal assurance. In thatLife nothing is destroyed. There is only ineffable happiness that will nevergrow stale—a happiness always new.So that is why it is worthwhile to seek God. All those who sincerely seek Himwill surely find Him. Those who want to love the Lord and yearn to enter Hiskingdom, and who sincerely wish in their hearts to know Him, will find Him. Youmust have an ever-increasing desire for Him, day and night. He will acknowledgeyour love by fulfilling His promise to you throughout eternity, and you shallknow joy and happiness unending. All is light, all is joy, all is peace, all islove. He is all.[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0064.html#footnote-369-backlink] Bhagavad Gita XI:12, Sir Edwin Arnold’stranslation.2 [part0064.html#footnote-368-backlink] “The state that, once found, the yogiconsiders as the treasure beyond all other treasures—anchored therein, he isimmune to even the mightiest grief” (Bhagavad Gita VI:22).3 [part0064.html#footnote-367-backlink] “That which is night (of slumber) to allcreatures is (luminous) wakefulness to the man of self-mastery.

Mark it well. Read and inwardly digestit, and put into practice the truths that God has expressed through me.First, ask yourself: “Have I found God?” If your answer doesn’t satisfy you, getbusy sincerely with meditation, as taught by the Self-realized masters who havefound Him.India’s saints experimented through the ages to perfect the universallyscientific yoga methods of emancipation, of attaining oneness with God. For yourown satisfaction, apply those methods in your spiritual seeking, for you cannotfind the Supreme without following the law of concentration and meditation,which alone leads to Him. Material scientists are gathering secrets from natureevery day by applying the physical laws that lead to discovery. Withoutsimilarly utilizing spiritual laws, dogmatic theology becomes stagnant,powerless to open the doors to God.Absentminded prayers and affirmations, and untested decrees and beliefs will notgive you God. The step-by-step yoga techniques of Self-realization, the help ofa guru (one who has traveled beyond the forest of theology and knows God), anddaily deep effort in yoga meditation will lead you to the Divine Goal. In theGita we find the testimony of the Lord Himself: “Thou canst not see Me withmortal eyes. Therefore I give thee sight divine. Behold My supreme power ofyoga.”2 [part0065.html#footnote-370]To reach God you must find some time every day to be alone with Him; you mustget away from too many distractions, too many fruitless engagements, too manydesires, too much waste of time; and you must follow a spiritually awakenedteacher who has found Him. Use your common sense and intuition to recognize thetrue teachers who know Him. Those alone who have experienced God can lead you toHim.Use the night hours as much as you can, and the early morning, and all freemoments between demanding duties, to pray inwardly to God with all your soul:“Reveal Thyself!” Solitude is the price of God-realization. Wake! Waste no moretime in blind believing; follow the tested methods of attainingSelf-realization, and know God.[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0065.html#footnote-371-backlink] This selection was written byParamahansa Yogananda.

Earth has no illusions for me; I have seen throughthem all. You too should realize that you are visiting this earth onlytemporarily; you are here solely to learn necessary lessons and to help all whocross your path. You do not know why you have been cast in a particular role, soyou must learn what God expects of you. Don’t harbor personal desires; your onlydesire should be to follow the Lord’s will and to live and work for Him.We are here today, tomorrow we are gone: mere shadows in a cosmic dream. Butbehind the unreality of these fleeting pictures is the immortal reality ofSpirit. Life here on earth appears futile and chaotic until we are anchored inthe Divine.This is why, as I have often told you, I am here to testify to the supremeimportance of Spirit. Do not concentrate upon ephemeral worldly goals and humanattachments. Such fanaticism takes your mind away from the Lord and your eternalSelf in Him. “He who has overcome attachment both to sense objects and toactions, and who is free from ego-instigated plannings—that man is said to haveattained firm union of soul with Spirit.”1 [part0066.html#footnote-376]You came here through the will of God, but He gave you freedom to live accordingto your own will. You should learn now to be obedient to the will of theAlmighty. This is how I try to be. Every morning I ask Him to tell me what Hewants me to do; then I see Him working through my hands and brain, andeverything goes as He wishes.That is the Power you should trust, the Power through which you can findguidance, happiness, strength, and freedom. That is the Power which will giveyou emancipation.No other duty is important if it takes your thought and desire away from yourduty to God; all else is illusion. To grasp this truth I had to remove allworldly hallucinations from my brain, through meditation and the company ofgreat masters. I want to instill this understanding in your hearts: until yourealize that God is more important than anything else, and until you spend yourlife in seeking to please Him, you are not spiritually evolved at all.To Ignore God Is Not Common SenseIs it not true wisdom to do His will and to be directly helpful in bringingothers back to Him? My greatest joy is to remind others of the importance andnecessity of remembering God. This earth is a foreign land; we are not in ourown Home. In an instant you may be required to leave this world; you will haveto cancel all your engagements. Why then give any other activity firstimportance, with the result that you have no time for God? That is not commonsense. It is because of maya, the net of cosmic delusion which is thrown overus, that we entangle ourselves in mundane interests and forget the Lord.Jesus said: “If thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee:for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and notthat thy whole body should be cast into hell.”2 [part0066.html#footnote-375]He was speaking not literally but metaphorically; it is only if the mind hasbecome enmeshed in wrong desires that any of the senses can offend the divinesoul image within man. Christ meant that so long as wrong desires lead thesenses astray, we shall remain oblivious of God, in whom our real happinesslies. Therefore it is better, he said, to be maimed of the senses than to misusethem. Christ spoke in a dramatic way to point out that nothing in life, not eventhe body, is of any value if we remain in ignorance of God. Without knowing Him,life becomes a “hell”—a hornet’s nest of troubles. There is no security in thisworld; one never knows from what quarter disaster may strike.A man with cancer lies in the hospital. “Well,” you say, “that is not I; it issomebody else.” But I have mentally put myself in such bodies and I know howhopeless those people feel. While you are well and strong, do not spend yourtime on foolishness. God understands everything; He knows He has sent us to thisterrible place. He grieves in His heart at our sufferings. Nothing hurts Himmore than to see us grovel in the mud of delusion. He wants us to come backHome. And to those who make the effort to know Him, He responds: “From sheercompassion I, the Divine Indweller, set alight in them the radiant lamp ofwisdom which banishes the darkness that is born of ignorance.”3[part0066.html#footnote-374]For every man who retraces his steps to God, there is a great celebration amongthe angels. They actually appear and receive that returning soul in great joy.There is no way back Home if you weave around you a snare of worldly desires.You came to play your part on the stage of time, to fill the role that you weredesigned for in the divine drama; but the essential part of your role is tothink of Him and to do His will, naught else. Every thought, every act, isdeluded that does not place Him first. The Hindu scriptures say: “As soon as youfeel the desire for God, immediately change your life and plunge into Him.”Each soul must find its way back alone. No one but you is responsible for yourmistakes and habits. Once you have found your Self in your soul, you are free.But so long as you are not free, so long there is danger; you will have to comeback to earth and work out all the desires that remain unfinished.4[part0066.html#footnote-373] Your body is mortal but the soul outlasts the body.If you die wanting a Cadillac you will have to come back here for it; you willnot be able to get it in heaven, where cars are not used.Although the force of desires is strong, the potency of Divine Will is stronger.That Will is in you and will work through you, if you permit it, and if yourefuse to let worldly motivations weave nets of incarnations around you.Seek God while you are young and strong, because in old age and disease you maynot be able to seek Him. By the time most people begin to understand the truemeaning of life, the body is weakening; they have to spend their time lookingafter the frail physical machine instead of pursuing the search for Reality.The only purpose of life is to find God. If you are married, you and your lovedone should seek the Divine together. But if you are unmarried, obey at onceChrist’s command: “Seek ye first the kingdom of God.” When you know Him, He willtell you what to do. Otherwise, you don’t know what fate may await you inmarriage. The tragic stories that come to my ears are unimaginable! Terribletales of human incompatibility. People should be taught in youth how to controltheir emotions. I don’t think anyone should marry without first having learnedto control his impulses. Until one is emotionally stable, he is not fit to havea family. The greatest thing is to possess self-control; then, if you want tomarry, the right person will be drawn magnetically into your life.Ignorance is like a great poison in the system. Because of it we don’t realizeour true nature, made in the image of God. First of all, find out by ceaselessprayer what the Lord wants you to do. There is nothing greater than obeying Hiswill. It is your desires that enslave you and make you think, “I want this” or“I want that.” Do not act on what your enemy, the ego, dictates; seek rather todo the will of the Heavenly Father, your sole Friend.So long as ignorance remains, you cannot tell how many incarnations of sufferingmay be ahead of you. Eliminate ignorance by meditation. The longer you meditate,the more completely you will “cauterize” the injurious mental bacteria that havebeen infecting you for ages. For instance, some people are prone to anger; theydo not realize that they have been cultivating the habit of wrathfulness formany lives. Others are slaves to the sex instinct as a result of bad habits forincarnations. It is best to struggle to get rid of bad habits now. “Him thatovercometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no moreout (reincarnate no more).”5 [part0066.html#footnote-372]Daily say with me to the Lord: “I am working for You. Whenever You want to takeme, I am ready. I am Your child.” He will give you the same freedom I amenjoying. I take on more and more work but I never feel I am overburdened,because I do everything for Him. I love Him. That surrender to God has destroyedin me the karma of ignorance. So long as there is a weeping brother by thewayside, I will come again into this world to wipe away his tears. Why should Ibe content to enjoy the blessings of heaven while others are suffering?The Romance of Divine LoveReform your life. Every night commune with Him; talk to Him; pray to Himsincerely. Give up the mockery of half-hearted prayer. Say, “Lord, I know Youare here. You must talk to me! Come out of the cave of silence.” This prayer isexpressed in a song I wrote to the Divine Mother when I visited the desert nearPalm Springs:Mother, I give You my soul call!You can’t remain hidden any more.Come out of the silent sky,Come out of the mountain glen,Come out of my secret soul,Come out of my cave of silence.I had just finished the song when I saw a wondrous form, the Divine Mother!appear from out of the sky. In response to my soul call, I beheld everywhere, ineverything, the Cosmic Mother. I prayed and worshiped Her. She blessed me andtalked with me.The greatest romance is with the Infinite. You have no idea how beautiful lifecan be. “Unattracted to the sensory world, the yogi experiences the ever new joyinherent in the Self. Engaged in divine union of the soul with Spirit, heattains bliss indestructible” (Bhagavad Gita V:21). When you suddenly find Godeverywhere, when He comes and talks to you and guides you, the romance of divinelove has begun.[../images/00005.jpeg]1 [part0066.html#footnote-376-backlink] Bhagavad Gita VI:4.2 [part0066.html#footnote-375-backlink] Matthew 5:29.3 [part0066.html#footnote-374-backlink] Bhagavad Gita X:11.4 [part0066.html#footnote-373-backlink] Desires may be worked out by materialfulfillment or, according to one’s spiritual development, by the mental processof discrimination or the spiritual process of deep meditation.5 [part0066.html#footnote-372-backlink] Revelation 3:12."},{"pageContent":"GOD!

God!When my mind weaves dreamsWith threads of memories,On that magic cloth I do emboss:God! God! God!Every night, in time of deepest sleep,My peace dreams and calls: Joy! Joy! Joy!And my joy comes singing evermore:God! God! God!In waking, eating, working, dreaming, sleeping,Serving, meditating, chanting, divinely loving,My soul constantly hums, unheard by any:God! God! God!"},{"pageContent":"Paramahansa Yogananda:A Yogi in Life and DeathParamahansa Yogananda entered mahasamadhi (a yogi’s final conscious exit fromthe body) in Los Angeles, California, on March 7, 1952, after concluding hisspeech at a banquet held in honor of H. E. Binay R. Sen, Ambassador of India.The great world teacher demonstrated the value of yoga (scientific techniquesfor God-realization) not only in life but in death. Weeks after his departurehis unchanged face shone with the divine luster of incorruptibility.Mr. Harry T. Rowe, Los Angeles Mortuary Director, Forest Lawn Memorial-Park (inwhich the body of the great master is temporarily placed), sent Self-RealizationFellowship a notarized letter from which the following extracts are taken:“The absence of any visual signs of decay in the dead body of ParamahansaYogananda offers the most extraordinary case in our experience….No physicaldisintegration was visible in his body even twenty days after death….Noindication of mold was visible on his skin, and no visible desiccation (dryingup) took place in the bodily tissues. This state of perfect preservation of abody is, so far as we know from mortuary annals, an unparalleled one….At thetime of receiving Yogananda’s body, the Mortuary personnel expected to observe,through the glass lid of the casket, the usual progressive signs of bodilydecay. Our astonishment increased as day followed day without bringing anyvisible change in the body under observation. Yogananda’s body was apparently ina phenomenal state of immutability….“No odor of decay emanated from his body at any time….The physical appearance ofYogananda on March 27th, just before the bronze cover of the casket was put intoposition, was the same as it had been on March 7th. He looked on March 27th asfresh and as unravaged by decay as he had looked on the night of his death. OnMarch 27th there was no reason to say that his body had suffered any visiblephysical disintegration at all. For these reasons we state again that the caseof Paramahansa Yogananda is unique in our experience.”"},{"pageContent":"Image: Commemorative stamp issued by the Government of India in ParamahansaYogananda's honor [../images/00021.jpeg]In 1977, on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the mahasamadhi of ParamahansaYogananda, the Government of India issued this commemorative stamp in his honor.With the stamp, the government published a descriptive leaflet, which read, inpart:The ideal of love for God and service to humanity found full expression in thelife of Paramahansa Yogananda….Though the major part of his life was spentoutside of India, still he takes his place among our great saints.

The exalted disciple to whom Bhagavan Krishna imparted the immortalmessage of the Bhagavad Gita (q.v.); one of the five Pandava princes in thegreat Hindu epic, the Mahabharata, in which he was a key figure.ashram. A spiritual hermitage; often a monastery.astral body. Man’s subtle body of light, prana or lifetrons; the second of threesheaths that successively encase the soul: the causal body (q.v.), the astralbody, and the physical body. The powers of the astral body enliven the physicalbody, much as electricity illumines a bulb. The astral body has nineteenelements: intelligence, ego, feeling, mind (sense-consciousness); fiveinstruments of knowledge (the sensory powers within the physical organs ofsight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch); five instruments of action (theexecutive powers in the physical instruments of procreation, excretion, speech,locomotion, and the exercise of manual skill); and five instruments of lifeforce that perform the functions of circulation, metabolization, assimilation,crystallization, and elimination.astral light. The subtle light emanating from lifetrons (see prana); thestructural essence of the astral world. Through the all-inclusive intuitiveperception of the soul, devotees in concentrated states of meditation mayperceive the astral light, particularly as the spiritual eye (q.v.).astral world. The subtle sphere of the Lord’s creation, a universe of light andcolor composed of finer-than-atomic forces, i.e., vibrations of life energy orlifetrons (see prana). Every being, every object, every vibration on thematerial plane has an astral counterpart, for in the astral universe (heaven) isthe blueprint of our material universe. At physical death, the soul of man,clothed in an astral body of light, ascends to one of the higher or lower astralplanes, according to merit, to continue his spiritual evolution in the greaterfreedom of that subtle realm. There he remains for a karmically predeterminedtime until physical rebirth.Aum (Om). The Sanskrit root word or seed-sound symbolizing that aspect ofGodhead which creates and sustains all things; Cosmic Vibration. Aum of theVedas became the sacred word Hum of the Tibetans; Amin of the Moslems; and Amenof the Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Jews, and Christians. The world’s greatreligions state that all created things originate in the cosmic vibratory energyof Aum or Amen, the Word or Holy Ghost. “In the beginning was the Word, and theWord was with God, and the Word was God....All things were made by him [the Wordor Aum]; and without him was not any thing made that was made” (John 1:1,3).Amen in Hebrew means sure, faithful. “These things saith the Amen, the faithfuland true witness, the beginning of the creation of God” (Revelation 3:14). Evenas sound is produced by the vibration of a running motor, so the omnipresentsound of Aum faithfully testifies to the running of the “Cosmic Motor,” whichupholds all life and every particle of creation through vibratory energy. In theSelf-Realization Fellowship Lessons (q.v.), Paramahansa Yogananda teachestechniques of meditation whose practice brings direct experience of God as Aumor Holy Ghost. That blissful communion with the invisible divine Power (“theComforter, which is the Holy Ghost”—John 14:26) is the truly scientific basis ofprayer.avatar. Divine incarnation; from the Sanskrit avatara, with roots ava, “down,”and tri, “to pass.” One who attains union with Spirit and then returns to earthto help mankind is called an avatar.avidya. Literally, “non-knowledge,” ignorance; the manifestation in man of maya,the cosmic delusion (q.v.). Essentially, avidya is man’s ignorance of his divinenature and of the sole reality: Spirit.Babaji. See Mahavatar Babaji.Bhagavad Gita. “Song of the Lord.” An ancient Indian scripture consisting ofeighteen chapters from the Mahabharata epic. Presented in the form of a dialoguebetween the avatar (q.v.) Lord Krishna and his disciple Arjuna on the eve of thehistoric battle of Kurukshetra, the Gita is a profound treatise on the scienceof Yoga (union with God) and a timeless prescription for happiness and successin everyday living. The Gita is allegory as well as history, a spiritualdissertation on the inner battle between man’s good and bad tendencies.Depending on the context, Krishna symbolizes the guru, the soul, or God; Arjunarepresents the aspiring devotee. Of this universal scripture Mahatma Gandhiwrote: “Those who will meditate on the Gita will derive fresh joy and newmeanings from it every day. There is not a single spiritual tangle which theGita cannot unravel.”Unless otherwise indicated, the quotations from the Bhagavad Gita in this volumeare from Paramahansa Yogananda’s own translations, which he rendered from theSanskrit sometimes literally and sometimes in paraphrase, depending on thecontext of his talk. For most Gita quotations in this reprinting of Man’sEternal Quest, the version used is the definitive one given by Paramahansaji forhis comprehensive translation and commentary: God Talks With Arjuna: TheBhagavad Gita—Royal Science of God-Realization (published by Self-RealizationFellowship in 1995). In talks where he was rendering a Gita passage more freelyin order to emphasize a specific point, the paraphrase has been retained andnoted as such in the footnote citation.Bhagavan Krishna. An avatar (q.v.) who lived in ancient India ages before theChristian era. One of the meanings given for the word Krishna in the Hinduscriptures is “Omniscient Spirit.” Thus, Krishna, like Christ, is a spiritualtitle signifying the divine magnitude of the avatar—his oneness with God. Thetitle Bhagavan means “Lord.” At the time he gave the discourse recorded in theBhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna was ruler of a kingdom in northern India. In hisearly life, Krishna lived as a cowherd who enchanted his companions with themusic of his flute. In this role Krishna is often considered to representallegorically the soul playing the flute of meditation to guide all misledthoughts back to the fold of omniscience.Bhakti Yoga. The spiritual approach to God that stresses all-surrendering loveas the principal means for communion and union with God. See Yoga.Brahma-Vishnu-Shiva. Three aspects of God’s immanence in creation. Theyrepresent that triune function of the Christ Intelligence (Tat) that guidesCosmic Nature’s activities of creation, preservation, and dissolution. SeeTrinity.Brahman (Brahma). Absolute Spirit.breath. “The influx of innumerable cosmic currents into man by way of the breathinduces restlessness in his mind,” Paramahansa Yogananda wrote. “Thus the breathlinks him with the fleeting phenomenal worlds. To escape from the sorrows oftransitoriness and to enter the blissful realm of Reality, the yogi learns toquiet the breath by scientific meditation.”caste. Caste in its original conception was not a hereditary status, but aclassification based on man’s natural capacities. In his evolution, man passesthrough four distinct grades, designated by ancient Hindu sages as Sudra,Vaisya, Kshatriya, and Brahmin. The Sudra is interested primarily in satisfyinghis bodily needs and desires; the work that best suits his state of developmentis bodily labor. The Vaisya is ambitious for worldly gain as well as forsatisfaction of the senses; he has more creative ability than the Sudra andseeks occupation as a farmer, a businessman, an artist, or wherever his mentalenergy finds fulfillment. The Kshatriya, having through many lives fulfilled thedesires of the Sudra and Vaisya states, begins to seek the meaning of life; hetries to overcome his bad habits, to control his senses, and to do what isright. Kshatriyas by occupation are noble rulers, statesmen, warriors. TheBrahmin has overcome his lower nature, has a natural affinity for spiritualpursuits, and is God-knowing, able therefore to teach and help liberate others.causal body. Essentially, man as a soul is a causal-bodied being. His causalbody is an idea-matrix for the astral and physical bodies. The causal body iscomposed of 35 idea elements corresponding to the 19 elements of the astral bodyplus the 16 basic material elements of the physical body.causal world. Behind the physical world of matter (atoms, protons, electrons),and the subtle astral world of luminous life energy (lifetrons), is the causal,or ideational, world of thought (thoughtrons). After man evolves sufficiently totranscend the physical and astral universes, he resides in the causal universe.In the consciousness of causal beings, the physical and astral universes areresolved to their thought essence. Whatever physical man can do in imagination,causal man can do in actuality—the only limitation being thought itself.Ultimately, man sheds the last soul covering—his causal body—to unite withomnipresent Spirit, beyond all vibratory realms.chakras. In Yoga, the seven occult centers of life and consciousness in thespine and brain, which enliven the physical and astral bodies of man. Thesecenters are referred to as chakras (“wheels”) because the concentrated energy ineach one is like a hub from which radiate rays of life-giving light and energy.In ascending order, these chakras are muladhara (the coccygeal, at the base ofthe spine); svadhisthana (the sacral, two inches above muladhara); manipura (thelumbar, opposite the navel); anahata (the dorsal, opposite the heart); vishuddha(the cervical, at the base of the neck); ajna (traditionally located between theeyebrows; in actuality, directly connected by polarity with the medulla; seealso medulla and spiritual eye); and sahasrara (in the uppermost part of thecerebrum).The seven centers are divinely planned exits or “trap doors” through which thesoul has descended into the body and through which it must reascend by a processof meditation. By seven successive steps, the soul escapes into CosmicConsciousness. In its conscious upward passage through the seven opened or“awakened” cerebrospinal centers, the soul travels the highway to the Infinite,the true path by which the soul must retrace its course to reunite with God.Yoga treatises generally consider only the six lower centers as chakras, withsahasrara referred to separately as a seventh center. All seven centers,however, are often referred to as lotuses, whose petals open, or turn upward, inspiritual awakening as the life and consciousness travel up the spine.chitta. Intuitive feeling; the aggregate of consciousness, inherent in which isahamkara (egoity), buddhi (intelligence), and manas (mind or senseconsciousness).Christ center. The Kutastha or ajna chakra at the point between the eyebrows,directly connected by polarity with the medulla (q.v.); center of will andconcentration, and of Christ Consciousness (q.v.); seat of the spiritual eye(q.v.).Christ Consciousness. “Christ” or “Christ Consciousness” is the projectedconsciousness of God immanent in all creation. In Christian scripture it iscalled the “only begotten son,” the only pure reflection in creation of God theFather; in Hindu scripture it is called Kutastha Chaitanya or Tat, the cosmicintelligence of Spirit everywhere present in creation. It is the universalconsciousness, oneness with God, manifested by Jesus, Krishna, and otheravatars. Great saints and yogis know it as the state of samadhi (q.v.)meditation wherein their consciousness has become identified with theintelligence in every particle of creation; they feel the entire universe astheir own body. See Trinity.Concentration Technique. The Self-Realization Fellowship Technique ofConcentration (also Hong-Sau Technique) taught in the Self-RealizationFellowship Lessons. This technique helps scientifically to withdraw theattention from all objects of distraction and to place it upon one thing at atime. Thus it is invaluable for meditation, concentration on God. The Hong-SauTechnique is an integral part of the science of Kriya Yoga (q.v.).consciousness, states of. In mortal consciousness man experiences three states:waking consciousness, sleeping consciousness, and dreaming consciousness. But hedoes not experience his soul, superconsciousness, and he does not experienceGod. The Christ-man does. As mortal man is conscious throughout his body, so theChrist-man is conscious throughout the universe, which he feels as his body.Beyond the state of Christ consciousness is cosmic consciousness, the experienceof oneness with God in His absolute consciousness beyond vibratory creation aswell as with the Lord’s omnipresence manifesting in the phenomenal worlds.Cosmic Consciousness. The Absolute; Spirit beyond creation. Also thesamadhi-meditation state of oneness with God both beyond and within vibratorycreation. See Trinity.cosmic delusion. See maya.cosmic energy. See prana.Cosmic Intelligent Vibration. See Aum.Cosmic Sound. See Aum.dharma. Eternal principles of righteousness that uphold all creation; man’sinherent duty to live in harmony with these principles. See also SanatanaDharma.diksha. Spiritual initiation; from the Sanskrit verb-root diksh, to dedicateoneself. See also disciple and Kriya Yoga.disciple. A spiritual aspirant who comes to a guru seeking introduction to God,and to this end establishes an eternal spiritual relationship with the guru. InSelf-Realization Fellowship, the guru-disciple relationship is established bydiksha, initiation, in Kriya Yoga. See also guru and Kriya Yoga.Divine Mother. The aspect of God that is active in creation; the shakti, orpower, of the Transcendent Creator. Other terms for this aspect of Divinity areNature or Prakriti, Aum, Holy Ghost, Cosmic Intelligent Vibration. Also, thepersonal aspect of God as Mother, embodying the Lord’s love and compassionatequalities.The Hindu scriptures teach that God is both immanent and transcendent, personaland impersonal. He may be sought as the Absolute; as one of His manifest eternalqualities, such as love, wisdom, bliss, light; in the form of an ishta (deity);or in a concept such as Heavenly Father, Mother, Friend.egoism. The ego-principle, ahamkara (lit., “I do”), is the root cause of dualismor the seeming separation between man and his Creator. Ahamkara brings humanbeings under the sway of maya (q.v.), by which the subject (ego) falsely appearsas object; the creatures imagine themselves to be creators. By banishing egoconsciousness, man awakens to his divine identity, his oneness with the SoleLife: God.elements (five). The Cosmic Vibration, or Aum, structures all physical creation,including man’s physical body, through the manifestation of five tattvas(elements): earth, water, fire, air, and ether (q.v.). These are structuralforces, intelligent and vibratory in nature. Without the earth element therewould be no state of solid matter; without the water element, no liquid state;without the air element, no gaseous state; without the fire element, no heat;without the ether element, no background on which to produce the cosmic motionpicture show. In the body, prana (cosmic vibratory energy) enters the medullaand is then divided into the five elemental currents by the action of the fivelower chakras (q.v.), or centers: the coccygeal (earth), sacral (water), lumbar(fire), dorsal (air), and cervical (ether). The Sanskrit terminology for theseelements is prithivi, ap, tej, prana, and akasha.Energization Exercises. Man is surrounded by cosmic energy, much as a fish issurrounded by water. The Energization Exercises, originated by ParamahansaYogananda and taught in the Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons (q.v.), enableman to recharge his body with this cosmic energy, or universal prana.ether. Sanskrit akasha. Though not considered a factor in present scientifictheory on the nature of the material universe, ether has for millenniums been soreferred to by India’s sages. Paramahansa Yogananda spoke of ether as thebackground on which God projects the cosmic motion picture of creation. Spacegives dimension to objects; ether separates the images. This “background,” acreative force that coordinates all spatial vibrations, is a necessary factorwhen considering the subtler forces—thought and life energy (prana)—and thenature of space and the origin of material forces and matter. See elements.evil. The satanic force that obscures God’s omnipresence in creation,manifesting as inharmonies in man and nature. Also, a broad term defininganything contrary to divine law (see dharma) that causes man to lose theconsciousness of his essential unity with God, and that obstructs attainment ofGod-realization.gunas. The three attributes of Nature: tamas, rajas, and sattva—obstruction,activity, and expansion; or, mass, energy, and intelligence. In man the threegunas express themselves as ignorance or inertia; activity or struggle; andwisdom.guru. Spiritual teacher. Though the word guru is often misused to refer simplyto any teacher or instructor, a true God-illumined guru is one who, in hisattainment of self-mastery, has realized his identity with the omnipresentSpirit. Such a one is uniquely qualified to lead the seeker on his or her inwardjourney toward divine realization.When a devotee is ready to seek God in earnest, the Lord sends him a guru.Through the wisdom, intelligence, Self-realization, and teachings of such amaster, God guides the disciple. By following the master’s teachings anddiscipline, the disciple is able to fulfill his soul’s desire for the manna ofGod-perception. A true guru, ordained by God to help sincere seekers in responseto their deep soul craving, is not an ordinary teacher: he is a human vehiclewhose body, speech, mind, and spirituality God uses as a channel to attract andguide lost souls back to their home of immortality. A guru is a livingembodiment of scriptural truth. He is an agent of salvation appointed by God inresponse to a devotee’s demand for release from the bondage of matter. “To keepcompany with the Guru,” wrote Swami Sri Yukteswar in The Holy Science, “is notonly to be in his physical presence (as this is sometimes impossible), butmainly means to keep him in our hearts and to be one with him in principle andto attune ourselves with him.” See master.Gurudeva. “Divine teacher,” a customary Sanskrit term of respect that is used inaddressing and referring to one’s spiritual preceptor; sometimes rendered inEnglish as “Master.”Gurus of Self-Realization Fellowship. The Gurus of Self-Realization Fellowship(Yogoda Satsanga Society of India) are Jesus Christ, Bhagavan Krishna, and aline of exalted masters of contemporary times: Mahavatar Babaji, LahiriMahasaya, Swami Sri Yukteswar, and Paramahansa Yogananda. To show the harmonyand essential unity of the teachings of Jesus Christ and the Yoga precepts ofBhagavan Krishna is an integral part of the SRF dispensation. All of theseGurus, by their sublime teachings and divine instrumentality, contribute to thefulfillment of the Self-Realization Fellowship mission of bringing to allmankind a practical spiritual science of God-realization.Hatha Yoga. A system of techniques and physical postures (asanas) that promoteshealth and mental calm. See Yoga.Holy Ghost. See Aum and Trinity.intuition.

Jadava refers to the clan of which Bhagavan Krishna was king,and is one of many names by which Krishna is known. See Bhagavan Krishna.ji. A suffix denoting respect, added to names and titles in India; as, Gandhiji,Paramahansaji, Guruji.Jnana Yoga. The path to union with God through transmutation of thediscriminative power of the intellect into the omniscient wisdom of the soul.karma. Effects of past actions, from this or previous lifetimes; from theSanskrit kri, to do. The equilibrating law of karma, as expounded in the Hinduscriptures, is that of action and reaction, cause and effect, sowing andreaping. In the course of natural righteousness, every human being by histhoughts and actions becomes the molder of his own destiny. Whatever energies hehimself, wisely or unwisely, has set in motion must return to him as theirstarting point, like a circle inexorably completing itself. An understanding ofkarma as the law of justice serves to free the human mind from resentmentagainst God and man. A person’s karma follows him from incarnation toincarnation until fulfilled or spiritually transcended. See reincarnation.The cumulative actions of human beings within communities, nations, or the worldas a whole constitute mass karma, which produces local or far-ranging effectsaccording to the degree and preponderance of good or evil. The thoughts andactions of every human being, therefore, contribute to the good or ill of thisworld and all peoples in it.Karma Yoga. The path to God through nonattached action and service. By selflessservice, by giving the fruits of one’s actions to God, and by seeing God as thesole Doer, the devotee becomes free of the ego and experiences God. See Yoga.Krishna. See Bhagavan Krishna.Krishna Consciousness. Christ Consciousness; Kutastha Chaitanya. See ChristConsciousness.Kriya Yoga. A sacred spiritual science, originating millenniums ago in India. Itincludes certain techniques of meditation whose devoted practice leads torealization of God. Paramahansa Yogananda has explained that the Sanskrit rootof kriya is kri, to do, to act and react; the same root is found in the wordkarma, the natural principle of cause and effect. Kriya Yoga is thus “union(yoga) with the Infinite through a certain action or rite (kriya).” Kriya Yoga,a form of Raja (“royal” or “complete”) Yoga, is extolled by Krishna in theBhagavad Gita and by Patanjali in the Yoga Sutras. Revived in this age byMahavatar Babaji (q.v.), Kriya Yoga is the diksha (spiritual initiation)bestowed by the Gurus of Self-Realization Fellowship. Since the mahasamadhi(q.v.) of Paramahansa Yogananda, diksha is conferred through his appointedspiritual representative, the president of Self-Realization Fellowship/YogodaSatsanga Society of India (or through one appointed by the president). Toqualify for diksha Self-Realization members must fulfill certain preliminaryspiritual requirements. One who has received this diksha is a Kriya Yogi orKriyaban. See also guru and disciple.Lahiri Mahasaya. Lahiri was the family name of Shyama Charan Lahiri (1828–1895).Mahasaya, a Sanskrit religious title, means “large-minded.” Lahiri Mahasaya wasa disciple of Mahavatar Babaji, and the guru of Swami Sri Yukteswar (ParamahansaYogananda’s guru). A Christlike teacher with miraculous powers, he was also afamily man with business responsibilities. His mission was to make known a yogasuitable for modern man, in which meditation is balanced by right performance ofworldly duties. He has been called a Yogavatar, “Incarnation of Yoga.” LahiriMahasaya was the disciple to whom Babaji revealed the ancient, almost lostscience of Kriya Yoga (q.v.), instructing him in turn to initiate sincereseekers. Lahiri Mahasaya’s life is described in Autobiography of a Yogi.Laya Yoga. This yogic system teaches the absorption of mind in the perception ofcertain astral sounds, leading to union with God as the cosmic sound of Aum. SeeAum and Yoga.Lessons. See Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons.life force. See prana.lifetrons. See prana.mahasamadhi. Sanskrit maha, “great,” samadhi. The last meditation, or consciouscommunion with God, during which a perfected master merges himself in the cosmicAum and casts off the physical body. A master invariably knows beforehand thetime God has appointed for him to leave his bodily residence. See samadhi.Mahavatar Babaji. The deathless mahavatar (“great avatar”) who in 1861 gaveKriya Yoga (q.v.) initiation to Lahiri Mahasaya, and thereby restored to theworld the ancient technique of salvation. Perennially youthful, he has lived forcenturies in the Himalayas, bestowing a constant blessing on the world. Hismission has been to assist prophets in carrying out their special dispensations.Many titles signifying his exalted spiritual stature have been given to him, butthe mahavatar has generally adopted the simple name of Babaji, from the Sanskritbaba, “father,” and the suffix ji, denoting respect. More information about hislife and spiritual mission is given in Autobiography of a Yogi. See avatar.Mantra Yoga. Divine communion attained through devotional, concentratedrepetition of root-word sounds that have a spiritually beneficial vibratorypotency. See Yoga.master. One who has achieved self-mastery. Paramahansa Yogananda has pointed outthat “the distinguishing qualifications of a master are not physical butspiritual....Proof that one is a master is supplied only by the ability to enterat will the breathless state (sabikalpa samadhi) and by the attainment ofimmutable bliss (nirbikalpa samadhi).” See samadhi.Paramahansaji further states: “All scriptures proclaim that the Lord created manin His omnipotent image. Control over the universe appears to be supernatural,but in truth such power is inherent and natural in everyone who attains ‘rightremembrance’ of his divine origin. Men of God-realization...are devoid of theego-principle (ahamkara) and its uprisings of personal desires; the actions oftrue masters are in effortless conformity with rita, natural righteousness. InEmerson’s words, all great ones become ‘not virtuous, but Virtue; then is theend of the creation answered, and God is well pleased.’”maya. The delusory power inherent in the structure of creation, by which the Oneappears as many. Maya is the principle of relativity, inversion, contrast,duality, oppositional states; the “Satan” (lit., in Hebrew, “the adversary”) ofthe Old Testament prophets; and the “devil” whom Christ described picturesquelyas a “murderer” and a “liar,” because “there is no truth in him” (John 8:44).Paramahansa Yogananda wrote:“The Sanskrit word maya means ‘the measurer’; it is the magical power increation by which limitations and divisions are apparently present in theImmeasurable and Inseparable. Maya is Nature herself—the phenomenal worlds, everin transitional flux as antithesis to Divine Immutability.“In God’s plan and play (lila), the sole function of Satan or maya is to attemptto divert man from Spirit to matter, from Reality to unreality. ‘The devilsinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, thathe might destroy the works of the devil’ (I John 3:8). That is, themanifestation of Christ Consciousness, within man’s own being, effortlesslydestroys the illusions or ‘works of the devil.’“Maya is the veil of transitoriness in Nature, the ceaseless becoming ofcreation; the veil that each man must lift in order to see behind it theCreator, the changeless Immutable, eternal Reality.”meditation. Concentration upon God. The term is used in a general sense todenote practice of any technique for interiorizing the attention and focusing iton some aspect of God. In the specific sense, meditation refers to the endresult of successful practice of such techniques: direct experience of Godthrough intuitive perception. It is the seventh step (dhyana) of the eightfoldpath of Yoga described by Patanjali (q.v.), achieved only after one has attainedthat fixed concentration within whereby he is completely undisturbed by sensoryimpressions from the outer world. In deepest meditation one experiences theeighth step of the Yoga path: samadhi (q.v.), communion, oneness with God. (Seealso Yoga.)medulla. The principal point of entry of life force (prana) into the body; seatof the sixth cerebrospinal center, whose function is to receive and direct theincoming flow of cosmic energy. The life force is stored in the seventh center(sahasrara) in the topmost part of the brain. From that reservoir it isdistributed throughout the body. The subtle center at the medulla is the mainswitch that controls the entrance, storage, and distribution of the life force.Mt. Washington. Site of, and, by extension, a frequently used name for theMother Center and international headquarters of Self-Realization Fellowship inLos Angeles. The 121/2-acre estate was acquired in 1925 by ParamahansaYogananda. He made it a training center for the Self-Realization FellowshipMonastic Order, and the administrative center for disseminating worldwide theancient science of Kriya Yoga.paramahansa. A spiritual title signifying a master (q.v.). It may be conferredonly by a true guru on a qualified disciple. Paramahansa literally means“supreme swan.” In the Hindu scriptures, the hansa or swan symbolizes spiritualdiscrimination. Swami Sri Yukteswar bestowed the title on his beloved discipleYogananda in 1935.paramguru. Literally, “the preceding guru”; the guru of one’s guru. ToSelf-Realizationists (disciples of Paramahansa Yogananda), paramguru refers toSri Yukteswar. To Paramahansaji, it meant Lahiri Mahasaya. Mahavatar Babaji isParamahansaji’s param-paramguru.Patanjali. Ancient exponent of Yoga, whose Yoga Sutras outline the principles ofthe yogic path, dividing it into eight steps: (1) yama, moral conduct; (2)niyama, religious observances; (3) asana, right posture to still bodilyrestlessness; (4) pranayama, control of prana, subtle life currents; (5)pratyahara, interiorization; (6) dharana, concentration; (7) dhyana, meditation;and (8) samadhi, superconscious experience. See Yoga.prana. Sparks of intelligent finer-than-atomic energy that constitute life,collectively referred to in Hindu scriptural treatises as prana, whichParamahansa Yogananda has translated as “lifetrons.” In essence, condensedthoughts of God; substance of the astral world (q.v.) and life principle of thephysical cosmos. In the physical world, there are two kinds of prana: (1) thecosmic vibratory energy that is omnipresent in the universe, structuring andsustaining all things; (2) the specific prana or energy that pervades andsustains each human body through five currents or functions. Prana currentperforms the function of crystallization; Vyana current, circulation; Samanacurrent, assimilation; Udana current, metabolism; and Apana current,elimination.pranam. A form of greeting in India. The hands are pressed, palms together, withthe base of the hands at the heart and the fingertips touching the forehead.This gesture is actually a modification of the pranam, literally “completesalutation,” from the Sanskrit root nam, “to salute or bow down,” and the prefixpra, “completely.” A pranam salutation is the general mode of greeting in India.Before renunciants and other persons held in high spiritual regard, it may beaccompanied by the spoken word, “Pranam.”pranayama. Conscious control of prana (the creative vibration or energy thatactivates and sustains life in the body). The yoga science of pranayama is thedirect way to consciously disconnect the mind from the life functions andsensory perceptions that tie man to body consciousness. Pranayama thus freesman’s consciousness to commune with God. All scientific techniques that bringabout union of soul and Spirit may be classified as yoga, and pranayama is thegreatest yogic method for attaining this divine union.Raja Yoga. The “royal” or highest path to God-union. It teaches scientificmeditation (q.v.) as the ultimate means for realizing God, and includes thehighest essentials from all other forms of Yoga. The Self-Realization FellowshipRaja Yoga teachings outline a way of life leading to perfect unfoldment in body,mind, and soul, based on the foundation of Kriya Yoga (q.v.) meditation. SeeYoga.Ranchi school. Yogoda Satsanga Vidyalaya, founded by Paramahansa Yogananda in1918 when the Maharaja of Kasimbazar gave his summer palace and twenty-fiveacres of land in Ranchi, Bihar, for use as a boys’ school. The property waspermanently acquired while Paramahansaji was in India in 1935 – 36. More thantwo thousand children now attend Yogoda schools at Ranchi, from nursery schoolthrough college. See Yogoda Satsanga Society of India.reincarnation. The doctrine that human beings, compelled by the law ofevolution, incarnate repeatedly in progressively higher lives—retarded by wrongactions and desires, and advanced by spiritual endeavors—until Self-realizationand God-union are attained. Having thus transcended the limitations andimperfections of mortal consciousness, the soul is forever freed from compulsoryreincarnation. “Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of myGod, and he shall go no more out” (Revelation 3:12).The concept of reincarnation is not exclusive to Eastern philosophy, but washeld as a fundamental truth of life by many ancient civilizations. The earlyChristian Church accepted the principle of reincarnation, which was expounded bythe Gnostics and by numerous church fathers, including Clement of Alexandria,Origen, and St. Jerome. It was not until the Second Council of Constantinople ina.d. 553 that the doctrine was officially removed from church teachings. Todaymany Western thinkers are beginning to adopt the concept of the law of karma(q.v.) and reincarnation, seeing in it a grand and reassuring explanation oflife’s seeming inequities.rishis. Seers, exalted beings who manifest divine wisdom; especially, theillumined sages of ancient India to whom the Vedas were intuitively revealed.sadhana. Path of spiritual discipline. The specific instruction and meditationpractices prescribed by the guru for his disciples, who by faithfully followingthem ultimately realize God.samadhi. The highest step on the Eightfold Path of Yoga, as outlined by the sagePatanjali (q.v.). Samadhi is attained when the meditator, the process ofmeditation (by which the mind is withdrawn from the senses by interiorization),and the object of meditation (God) become One. Paramahansa Yogananda hasexplained that “in the initial states of God-communion (sabikalpa samadhi) thedevotee’s consciousness merges in the Cosmic Spirit; his life force is withdrawnfrom the body, which appears ‘dead,’ or motionless and rigid. The yogi is fullyaware of his bodily condition of suspended animation. As he progresses to higherspiritual states (nirbikalpa samadhi), however, he communes with God withoutbodily fixation; and in his ordinary waking consciousness, even in the midst ofexacting worldly duties.” Both states are characterized by oneness with the evernew bliss of Spirit, but the nirbikalpa state is experienced by only the mosthighly advanced masters.Sanatana Dharma. Literally, “eternal religion.” The name given to the body ofVedic teachings that came to be called Hinduism after the Greeks designated thepeople on the banks of the river Indus as Indoos, or Hindus. See dharma.Satan. Literally, in Hebrew, “the adversary.” Satan is the conscious andindependent universal force that keeps everything and everybody deluded with theunspiritual consciousness of finiteness and separateness from God. To accomplishthis, Satan uses the weapons of maya (cosmic delusion) and avidya (individualdelusion, ignorance). See maya.Sat-Tat-Aum. Sat, Truth, the Absolute, Bliss; Tat, universal intelligence orconsciousness; Aum, cosmic intelligent creative vibration, word-symbol for God.See Aum and Trinity.Self. Capitalized to denote the atman or soul, the divine essence of man, asdistinguished from the ordinary self, which is the human personality or ego. TheSelf is individualized Spirit, whose essential nature is ever-existing,ever-conscious, ever-new Bliss. The Self or soul is man’s inner fountainhead oflove, wisdom, peace, courage, compassion, and all other divine qualities.Self-Realization. An abbreviated way of referring to Self-RealizationFellowship, the society founded by Paramahansa Yogananda, often used by him ininformal talks; e.g., “the Self-Realization teachings”; “the path ofSelf-Realization”; “Self-Realization headquarters in Los Angeles”; etc.Self-realization. Paramahansa Yogananda has defined Self-realization as follows:“Self-realization is the knowing—in body, mind, and soul—that we are one withthe omnipresence of God; that we do not have to pray that it come to us, that weare not merely near it at all times, but that God’s omnipresence is ouromnipresence; that we are just as much a part of Him now as we ever will be. Allwe have to do is improve our knowing.”Self-Realization Fellowship. The society founded by Paramahansa Yogananda in theUnited States in 1920 (and as Yogoda Satsanga Society of India in 1917) fordisseminating worldwide, for the aid and benefit of humanity, the spiritualprinciples and meditation techniques of Kriya Yoga (q.v.). The internationalheadquarters, the Mother Center, is in Los Angeles, California. ParamahansaYogananda has explained that the name Self-Realization Fellowship signifies“fellowship with God through Self-realization, and friendship with alltruth-seeking souls.” See also “Aims and Ideals of Self-Realization Fellowship,”page 426.Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons. The teachings of Paramahansa Yogananda,compiled into a comprehensive series of lessons for home study and madeavailable to sincere truth-seekers all over the world.

A quarterly journal published by Self-RealizationFellowship, featuring the talks and writings of Paramahansa Yogananda; andcontaining other spiritual, practical, and informative articles of currentinterest and lasting value.Shankara, Swami. Sometimes referred to as Adi (“the first”) Shankaracharya(Shankara + acharya, “teacher”); India’s most illustrious philosopher. His dateis uncertain; many scholars assign him to the eighth or early ninth century. Heexpounded God not as a negative abstraction, but as positive, eternal,omnipresent, ever new Bliss. Shankara reorganized the ancient Swami Order, andfounded four great maths (monastic centers of spiritual education), whoseleaders in apostolic succession bear the title of Jagadguru Sri Shankaracharya.The meaning of Jagadguru is “world teacher.”siddha. Literally, “one who is successful.” One who has attainedSelf-realization.soul. Individualized Spirit. The soul is the true and immortal nature of man,and of all living forms of life; it is cloaked only temporarily in the garmentsof causal, astral, and physical bodies. The nature of the soul is Spirit:ever-existing, ever-conscious, ever-new Joy.spiritual eye. The single eye of intuition and omnipresent perception at theChrist (Kutastha) center (ajna chakra) between the eyebrows. The deeplymeditating devotee beholds the spiritual eye as a ring of golden lightencircling a sphere of opalescent blue, and at the center, a pentagonal whitestar. Microcosmically, these forms and colors epitomize, respectively, thevibratory realm of creation (Cosmic Nature, Holy Ghost); the Son or intelligenceof God in creation (Christ Consciousness); and the vibrationless Spirit beyondall creation (God the Father).The spiritual eye is the entryway into the ultimate states of divineconsciousness. In deep meditation, as the devotee’s consciousness penetrates thespiritual eye, into the three realms epitomized therein, he experiencessuccessively the following states: superconsciousness or the ever new joy ofsoul-realization, and oneness with God as Aum (q.v.) or Holy Ghost; Christconsciousness, oneness with the universal intelligence of God in all creation;and cosmic consciousness, unity with the omnipresence of God that is beyond aswell as within vibratory manifestation. See also consciousness, states of;superconsciousness; Christ Consciousness.Explaining a passage from Ezekiel (43:1–2), Paramahansa Yogananda has written:“Through the divine eye in the forehead, (‘the east’), the yogi sails hisconsciousness into omnipresence, hearing the word or Aum, the divine sound of‘many waters’: the vibrations of light that constitute the sole reality ofcreation.” In Ezekiel’s words: “Afterwards he brought me to the gate, even thegate that looketh towards the east; and behold, the glory of the God of Israelcame from the way of the east; and His voice was like the noise of many waters;and the earth shined with His glory.”Jesus also spoke of the spiritual eye: “When thine eye is single, thy whole bodyalso is full of light....Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee benot darkness” (Luke 11:34–35).Sri. A title of respect. When used before the name of a religious person, itmeans “holy” or “revered.”Sri Yukteswar, Swami. Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri (1855–1936), India’s Jnanavatar,“Incarnation of Wisdom”; guru of Paramahansa Yogananda, and paramguru ofSelf-Realization Fellowship Kriyaban members. Sri Yukteswarji was a disciple ofLahiri Mahasaya. At the behest of Lahiri Mahasaya’s guru, Mahavatar Babaji, hewrote The Holy Science, a treatise on the underlying unity of Christian andHindu scriptures, and trained Paramahansa Yogananda for his spiritualworld-mission: the dissemination of Kriya Yoga (q.v.). Paramahansaji haslovingly described Sri Yukteswarji’s life in Autobiography of a Yogi.superconscious mind. The all-knowing power of the soul that perceives truthdirectly; intuition.superconsciousness. The pure, intuitive, all-seeing, ever-blissful consciousnessof the soul. Sometimes used generally to refer to all the various states ofsamadhi (q.v.) experienced in meditation, but specifically the first state ofsamadhi, wherein one transcends ego consciousness and realizes his self as soul,made in the image of God. Thence follow the higher states of realization: Christconsciousness and cosmic consciousness (q.v.).swami. A member of India’s most ancient monastic order, reorganized in theeighth or early ninth century by Swami Shankara (q.v.). A swami takes formalvows of celibacy and renunciation of worldly ties and ambitions; he devoteshimself to meditation and other spiritual practices, and to service to humanity.There are ten classificatory titles of the venerable Swami Order, as Giri, Puri,Bharati, Tirtha, Saraswati, and others. Swami Sri Yukteswar (q.v.) andParamahansa Yogananda belonged to the Giri (“mountain”) branch.The Sanskrit word swami means “he who is one with the Self (Swa).”Trinity. When Spirit manifests creation, It becomes the Trinity: Father, Son,Holy Ghost, or Sat, Tat, Aum. The Father (Sat) is God as the Creator existingbeyond creation. The Son (Tat) is God’s omnipresent intelligence existing increation. The Holy Ghost (Aum) is the vibratory power of God that objectifies orbecomes creation.Many cycles of cosmic creation and dissolution have come and gone in Eternity(see yuga). At the time of cosmic dissolution, the Trinity and all otherrelativities of creation resolve into the Absolute Spirit.Vedanta. Literally, “end of the Vedas”; the philosophy stemming from theUpanishads, or latter portion of the Vedas. Shankara (eighth or early ninthcentury) was the chief exponent of Vedanta, which declares that God is the onlyreality and that creation is essentially an illusion. As man is the onlycreature capable of conceiving of God, man himself must be divine, and his dutytherefore is to realize his true nature.Vedas. The four scriptural texts of the Hindus: Rig Veda, Sama Veda, Yajur Veda,and Atharva Veda. They are essentially a literature of chant, ritual, andrecitation for vitalizing and spiritualizing all phases of man’s life andactivity. Among the immense texts of India, the Vedas (Sanskrit root vid, “toknow”) are the only writings to which no author is ascribed. The Rig Vedaassigns a celestial origin to the hymns and tells us they have come down from“ancient times,” reclothed in new language. Divinely revealed from age to age tothe rishis, “seers,” the four Vedas are said to possess nityatva, “timelessfinality.”Yoga. From Sanskrit yuj, “union.” Yoga means union of the individual soul withSpirit; also, the methods by which this goal is attained. Within the largerspectrum of Hindu philosophy, Yoga is one of six orthodox systems: Vedanta,Mimamsa, Sankhya, Vaisesika, Nyaya, and Yoga. There are also various types ofyoga methods: Hatha Yoga, Mantra Yoga, Laya Yoga, Karma Yoga, Jnana Yoga, BhaktiYoga, and Raja Yoga. Raja Yoga, the “royal” or complete yoga, is that which istaught by Self-Realization Fellowship, and which Bhagavan Krishna extols to hisdisciple Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita: “The yogi is deemed greater thanbody-disciplining ascetics, greater even than the followers of the path ofwisdom or of the path of action; be thou, O Arjuna, a yogi!” (Bhagavad GitaVI:46). The sage Patanjali, foremost exponent of Yoga, has outlined eightdefinite steps by which the Raja Yogi attains samadhi, or union with God. Theseare (1) yama, moral conduct; (2) niyama, religious observances; (3) asana, rightposture to still bodily restlessness; (4) pranayama, control of prana, subtlelife currents; (5) pratyahara, interiorization; (6) dharana, concentration, (7)dhyana, meditation; and (8) samadhi, superconscious experience.yogi. One who practices Yoga (q.v.). Anyone who practices a scientific techniquefor divine realization is a yogi.

Itsheadquarters, Yogoda Math, is situated on the banks of the Ganges atDakshineswar, near Calcutta, with a branch math at Ranchi, Jharkhand. Inaddition to meditation centers and groups throughout India, Yogoda SatsangaSociety has seventeen educational institutions, from primary through collegelevel. Yogoda, a word coined by Paramahansa Yogananda, is derived from yoga,“union, harmony, equilibrium”; and da, “that which imparts.” Satsanga means“divine fellowship,” or “fellowship with Truth.” For the West, Paramahansajitranslated the Indian name as “Self-Realization Fellowship” (q.v.).yuga. A cycle or subperiod of creation, outlined in ancient Hindu texts. SriYukteswar (q.v.) describes in The Holy Science a 24,000-year Equinoctial Cycleand mankind’s present place in it. This cycle occurs within the much longeruniversal cycle of the ancient texts, as calculated by the ancient rishis andnoted in Autobiography of a Yogi, chapter 16:“The universal cycle of the scriptures is 4,300,560,000 years in extent, andmeasures out a ‘Day of Creation.’ This vast figure is based on the relationshipbetween the length of the solar year and a multiple of pi (3.1416, the ratio ofthe circumference to the diameter of a circle).“The life span for a whole universe, according to the ancient seers, is314,159,000,000,000 solar years, or ‘One Age of Brahma.’”"},{"pageContent":"Back cover [../images/00022.jpeg]"}]
